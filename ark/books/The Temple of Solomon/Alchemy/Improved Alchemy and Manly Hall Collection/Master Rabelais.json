It stands outside other things—a mixture of madmirth and gravity, of folly and reason, of childishness and gran-deur, of the commonplace and the out-of-the-way, of popularverve and polished humanism, of mother-wit and learning, ofbaseness and nobility, of personalities and broad generaliza-tion, of the comic and the serious, of the impossible and thefamiliar. Throughout the whole there is such a force of lifeand thought, such a power of good sense, a kind of assuranceso authoritative, that he takes rank with the greatest; and hispeers are not many. You may like him or not, may attack himor sing his praises, but you cannot ignore him. He is of thosethat die hard. Be as fastidious as you will; make up your mindto recognize only those who are, without any manner of doubt,beyond and above all others; however few the names you keep,Rabelais’ will always remain.We may know his work, may know it well, and admire itmore every time we read it. After being amused by it, afterhaving enjoyed it, we may return again to study it and toenter more fully into its meaning. Yet there is no possibilityof knowing his own life in the same fashion. In spite of allthe efforts, often successful, that have been made to throwlight on it, to bring forward a fresh document, or some ob-scure mention in a forgotten book, to add some little fact, tofix a date more precisely, it remains nevertheless full of un-certainty and of gaps. Besides, it has been burdened and sul-lied by all kinds of wearisome stories and foolish anecdotes,so that really there is more to weed out than to add.This injustice, at first wilful, had its rise in the sixteenthcentury, in the furious attacks of a monk of Fontevrault,Gabriel de Puy-Herbault, who seems to have drawn his con-clusions concerning the author from the book, and, moreespecially, in the regrettable satirical epitaph of Ronsard,piqued, it is said, that the Guises had given him only a littlepavillon in the Forest of Meudon, whereas the presbyterywas close to the chateau. From that time legend has fastenedon Rabelais, has completely travestied him, till, bit by bit, ithas made of him a buffoon, a veritable clown, a vagrant, aglutton, and a drunkard."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"5RabelaisThe likeness of his person has undergone a similar meta-morphosis. He has been credited with a full moon of a face,the rubicund nose of an incorrigible toper, and thick coarselips always apart because always laughing. The picture wouldhave surprised his friends no less than himself. There havebeen portraits painted of Rabelais; I have seen many such.They are all of the seventeenth century, and the greater num-ber are conceived in this jovial and popular style.As a matter of fact there is only one portrait of him thatcounts, that has more than the merest chance of being au-thentic, the one in the Chronologie collee or coupee. Underthis double name is known and cited a large sheet divided bylines and cross lines into little squares, containing about ahundred heads of illustrious Frenchmen. This sheet was stuckon pasteboard for hanging on the wall, and was cut in littlepieces, so that the portraits might be sold separately. Themajority of the portraits are of known persons and can there-fore be verified. Now it can be seen that these have beenselected with care, and taken from the most authentic sources;from statues, busts, medals, even stained glass, for the per-sons of most distinction, from earlier engravings for the oth-ers. Moreover, those of which no other copies exist, and whichare therefore the most valuable, have each an individualityvery distinct, in the features, the hair, the beard, as well as inthe costume. Not one of them is like another. There has beenno tampering with them, no forgery. On the contrary, there isin each a difference, a very marked personality. LeonardGaultier, who published this engraving towards the end of thesixteenth century, reproduced a great many portraits besidesfrom chalk drawings, in the style of his master, Thomas deLeu. It must have been such drawings that were the originalsof those portraits which he alone has issued, and which maytherefore be as authentic and reliable as the others whose cor-rectness we are in a position to verify.Now Rabelais has here nothing of the Roger Bontemps oflow degree about him. His features are strong, vigorouslycut, and furrowed with deep wrinkles; his beard is short andscanty; his cheeks are thin and already worn-looking. On hishead he wears the square cap of the doctors and the clerks,and his dominant expression, somewhat rigid and severe, isthat of a physician and a scholar. And this is the only por-trait to which we need attach any importance."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"6Gargantua & PantagruelThis is not the place for a detailed biography, nor for anexhaustive study. At most this introduction will serve as aframework on which to fix a few certain dates, to hang somegeneral observations. The date of Rabelais’ birth is very doubt-ful. For long it was placed as far back as 1483: now scholarsare disposed to put it forward to about 1495. The reason, agood one, is that all those whom he has mentioned as hisfriends, or in any real sense his contemporaries, were born atthe very end of the fifteenth century. And, indeed, it is in thereferences in his romance to names, persons, and places, thatthe most certain and valuable evidence is to be found of hisintercourse, his patrons, his friendships, his sojournings, andhis travels: his own work is the best and richest mine in whichto search for the details of his life.Like Descartes and Balzac, he was a native of Touraine,and Tours and Chinon have only done their duty in each ofthem erecting in recent years a statue to his honour, a two-fold homage reflecting credit both on the province and onthe town. But the precise facts about his birth are neverthe-less vague. Huet speaks of the village of Benais, nearBourgeuil, of whose vineyards Rabelais makes mention. Asthe little vineyard of La Deviniere, near Chinon, and famil-iar to all his readers, is supposed to have belonged to hisfather, Thomas Rabelais, some would have him born there. Itis better to hold to the earlier general opinion that Chinonwas his native town; Chinon, whose praises he sang with suchheartiness and affection. There he might well have been bornin the Lamproie house, which belonged to his father, who, tojudge from this circumstance, must have been in easy circum-stances, with the position of a well-to-do citizen. As LaLamproie in the seventeenth century was a hostelry, the fatherof Rabelais has been set down as an innkeeper. More probablyhe was an apothecary, which would fit in with the medicalprofession adopted by his son in after years. Rabelais had broth-ers, all older than himself. Perhaps because he was the young-est, his father destined him for the Church.The time he spent while a child with the Benedictine monksat Seuille is uncertain. There he might have made the ac-quaintance of the prototype of his Friar John, a brother ofthe name of Buinart, afterwards Prior of Sermaize. He waslonger at the Abbey of the Cordeliers at La Baumette, half amile from Angers, where he became a novice. As the broth-"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"7Rabelaisers Du Bellay, who were later his Maecenases, were then study-ing at the University of Angers, where it is certain he was nota student, it is doubtless from this youthful period that hisacquaintance and alliance with them should date. Voluntarily,or induced by his family, Rabelais now embraced the ecclesi-astical profession, and entered the monastery of the FranciscanCordeliers at Fontenay-le-Comte, in Lower Poitou, which washonoured by his long sojourn at the vital period of his lifewhen his powers were ripening. There it was he began to studyand to think, and there also began his troubles.In spite of the wide-spread ignorance among the monks ofthat age, the encyclopaedic movement of the Renaissancewas attracting all the lofty minds. Rabelais threw himselfinto it with enthusiasm, and Latin antiquity was not enoughfor him. Greek, a study discountenanced by the Church,which looked on it as dangerous and tending to freethoughtand heresy, took possession of him. To it he owed the warmfriendship of Pierre Amy and of the celebrated GuillaumeBude. In fact, the Greek letters of the latter are the best sourceof information concerning this period of Rabelais’ life. Itwas at Fontenay-le-Comte also that he became acquaintedwith the Brissons and the great jurist Andre Tiraqueau, whomhe never mentions but with admiration and deep affection.Tiraqueau’s treatise, De legibus connubialibus, published forthe first time in 1513, has an important bearing on the lifeof Rabelais. There we learn that, dissatisfied with the incom-plete translation of Herodotus by Laurent Valla, Rabelais hadretranslated into Latin the first book of the History. Thattranslation unfortunately is lost, as so many other of his scat-tered works. It is probably in this direction that the hazardof fortune has most discoveries and surprises in store for thelucky searcher. Moreover, as in this law treatise Tiraqueauattacked women in a merciless fashion, President AmauryBouchard published in 1522 a body in their defence, andRabelais, who was a friend of both the antagonists, took theside of Tiraqueau. It should be observed also in passing, thatthere are several pages of such audacious plain-speaking, thatRabelais, though he did not copy these in his Marriage ofPanurge, has there been, in his own fashion, as out spoken asTiraqueau. If such freedom of language could be permittedin a grave treatise of law, similar liberties were certainly, inthe same century, more natural in a book which was meant"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"8Gargantua & Pantagruelto amuse.The great reproach always brought against Rabelais is notthe want of reserve of his language merely, but his occasionalstudied coarseness, which is enough to spoil his whole work,and which lowers its value. La Bruyere, in the chapter Desouvrages de l’esprit, not in the first edition of the Caracteres,but in the fifth, that is to say in 1690, at the end of the greatcentury, gives us on this subject his own opinion and that ofhis age:‘Marot and Rabelais are inexcusable in their habit of scat-tering filth about their writings. Both of them had geniusenough and wit enough to do without any such expedient,even for the amusement of those persons who look more tothe laugh to be got out of a book than to what is admirablein it. Rabelais especially is incomprehensible. His book is anenigma,—one may say inexplicable. It is a Chimera; it is likethe face of a lovely woman with the feet and the tail of areptile, or of some creature still more loathsome. It is a mon-strous confusion of fine and rare morality with filthy cor-ruption. Where it is bad, it goes beyond the worst; it is thedelight of the basest of men. Where it is good, it reaches theexquisite, the very best; it ministers to the most delicate tastes.’Putting aside the rather slight connection established be-tween two men of whom one is of very little importancecompared with the other, this is otherwise very admirablysaid, and the judgment is a very just one, except with regardto one point—the misunderstanding of the atmosphere inwhich the book was created, and the ignoring of the examplesof a similar tendency furnished by literature as well as by thepopular taste. Was it not the Ancients that began it?Aristophanes, Catullus, Petronius, Martial, flew in the faceof decency in their ideas as well as in the words they used,and they dragged after them in this direction not a few ofthe Latin poets of the Renaissance, who believed themselvesbound to imitate them. Is Italy without fault in this respect?Her story-tellers in prose lie open to easy accusation. HerCapitoli in verse go to incredible lengths; and the astonish-ing success of Aretino must not be forgotten, nor the licenceof the whole Italian comic theatre of the sixteenth century.The Calandra of Bibbiena, who was afterwards a Cardinal,and the Mandragola of Machiavelli, are evidence enough,and these were played before Popes, who were not a whit"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"9Rabelaisembarrassed. Even in England the drama went very far for atime, and the comic authors of the reign of Charles II., evi-dently from a reaction, and to shake off the excess and thewearisomeness of Puritan prudery and affectation, which sentthem to the opposite extreme, are not exactly noted for theirreserve. But we need not go beyond France. Slight indica-tions, very easily verified, are all that may be set down here; aformal and detailed proof would be altogether too dangerous.Thus, for instance, the old Fabliaux—the Farces of the fif-teenth century, the story-tellers of the sixteenth—reveal oneof the sides, one of the veins, so to speak, of our literature.The art that addresses itself to the eye had likewise its shareof this coarseness. Think of the sculptures on the capitalsand the modillions of churches, and the crude frankness ofcertain painted windows of the fifteenth century. Queen Annewas, without any doubt, one of the most virtuous women inthe world. Yet she used to go up the staircase of her chateauat Blois, and her eyes were not offended at seeing at the footof a bracket a not very decent carving of a monk and a nun.Neither did she tear out of her book of Hours the large min-iature of the winter month, in which, careless of herneighbours’ eyes, the mistress of the house, sitting before hergreat fireplace, warms herself in a fashion which it is notadvisable that dames of our age should imitate. The statue ofCybele by the Tribolo, executed for Francis I., and placed,not against a wall, but in the middle of Queen Claude’s cham-ber at Fontainebleau, has behind it an attribute which wouldhave been more in place on a statue of Priapus, and whichwas the symbol of generativeness. The tone of the conversa-tions was ordinarily of a surprising coarseness, and thePrecieuses, in spite of their absurdities, did a very good workin setting themselves in opposition to it. The worthy Cheva-lier de La-Tour-Landry, in his Instructions to his own daugh-ters, without a thought of harm, gives examples which aresingular indeed, and in Caxton’s translation these are notomitted. The Adevineaux Amoureux, printed at Bruges byColard Mansion, are astonishing indeed when one considersthat they were the little society diversions of the Duchessesof Burgundy and of the great ladies of a court more luxuri-ous and more refined than the French court, which revelledin the Cent Nouvelles of good King Louis XI. Rabelais’ pleas-antry about the woman folle a la messe is exactly in the style"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"10Gargantua & Pantagruelof the Adevineaux.A later work than any of his, the Novelle of Bandello, shouldbe kept in mind—for the writer was Bishop of Agen, and hiswork was translated into French—as also the Dames Galantesof Brantome. Read the Journal of Heroard, that honest doc-tor, who day by day wrote down the details concerning thehealth of Louis XIII. from his birth, and you will under-stand the tone of the conversation of Henry IV. The jokes ata country wedding are trifles compared with this royal coarse-ness. Le Moyen de Parvenir is nothing but a tissue and amass of filth, and the too celebrated Cabinet Satyrique proveswhat, under Louis XIII., could be written, printed, and read.The collection of songs formed by Clairambault shows thatthe seventeenth and eighteenth centuries were no purer thanthe sixteenth. Some of the most ribald songs are actually thework of Princesses of the royal House.It is, therefore, altogether unjust to make Rabelais the scape-goat, to charge him alone with the sins of everybody else. Hespoke as those of his time used to speak; when amusing themhe used their language to make himself understood, and toslip in his asides, which without this sauce would never havebeen accepted, would have found neither eyes nor ears. Letus blame not him, therefore, but the manners of his time.Besides, his gaiety, however coarse it my appear to us—and how rare a thing is gaiety!—has, after all, nothing un-wholesome about it; and this is too often overlooked. Wheredoes he tempt one to stray from duty? Where, even indi-rectly, does he give pernicious advice? Whom has he led toevil ways? Does he ever inspire feelings that breed miscon-duct and vice, or is he ever the apologist of these? Manypoets and romance writers, under cover of a fastidious style,without one coarse expression, have been really and activelyhurtful; and of that it is impossible to accuse Rabelais. Womenin particular quickly revolt from him, and turn away repulsedat once by the archaic form of the language and by the out-spokenness of the words. But if he be read aloud to them,omitting the rougher parts and modernizing the pronuncia-tion, it will be seen that they too are impressed by his livelywit as by the loftiness of his thought. It would be possible,too, to extract, for young persons, without modification,admirable passages of incomparable force. But those whohave brought out expurgated editions of him, or who have"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"11Rabelaisthought to improve him by trying to rewrite him in modernFrench, have been fools for their pains, and their insultingattempts have had, and always will have, the success theydeserve.His dedications prove to what extent his whole work wasaccepted. Not to speak of his epistolary relations with Bude,with the Cardinal d’Armagnac and with Pellissier, the am-bassador of Francis I. and Bishop of Maguelonne, or of hisdedication to Tiraqueau of his Lyons edition of the EpistolaeMedicinales of Giovanni Manardi of Ferrara, of the one ad-dressed to the President Amaury Bouchard of the two legaltexts which he believed antique, there is still the evidence ofhis other and more important dedications. In 1532 he dedi-cated his Hippocrates and his Galen to Geoffroy d’Estissac,Bishop of Maillezais, to whom in 1535 and 1536 he ad-dressed from Rome the three news letters, which alone havebeen preserved; and in 1534 he dedicated from Lyons hisedition of the Latin book of Marliani on the topography ofRome to Jean du Bellay (at that time Bishop of Paris) whowas raised to the Cardinalate in 1535. Beside these dedica-tions we must set the privilege of Francis I. of September,1545, and the new privilege granted by Henry II. on August6th, 1550, Cardinal de Chatillon present, for the third book,which was dedicated, in an eight-lined stanza, to the Spiritof the Queen of Navarre. These privileges, from the praisesand eulogies they express in terms very personal and veryexceptional, are as important in Rabelais’ life as were, inconnection with other matters, the Apostolic Pastorals in hisfavour. Of course, in these the popes had not to introducehis books of diversions, which, nevertheless, would haveseemed in their eyes but very venial sins. The Sciomachie of1549, an account of the festivities arranged at Rome by Car-dinal du Bellay in honour of the birth of the second son ofHenry II., was addressed to Cardinal de Guise, and in 1552the fourth book was dedicated, in a new prologue, to Cardi-nal de Chatillon, the brother of Admiral de Coligny.These are no unknown or insignificant personages, butthe greatest lords and princes of the Church. They loved andadmired and protected Rabelais, and put no restrictions inhis way. Why should we be more fastidious and severe thanthey were? Their high contemporary appreciation gives muchfood for thought."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"12Gargantua & PantagruelThere are few translations of Rabelais in foreign tongues;and certainly the task is no light one, and demands morethan a familiarity with ordinary French. It would have beeneasier in Italy than anywhere else. Italian, from its flexibilityand its analogy to French, would have lent itself admirablyto the purpose; the instrument was ready, but the hand wasnot forthcoming. Neither is there any Spanish translation, afact which can be more easily understood. The Inquisitionwould have been a far more serious opponent than the Paris’Sorbonne, and no one ventured on the experiment. YetRabelais forces comparison with Cervantes, whose precur-sor he was in reality, though the two books and the two mindsare very different. They have only one point in common,their attack and ridicule of the romances of chivalry and ofthe wildly improbable adventures of knight-errants. But inDon Quixote there is not a single detail which would sug-gest that Cervantes knew Rabelais’ book or owed anythingto it whatsoever, even the starting-point of his subject. Per-haps it was better he should not have been influenced byhim, in however slight a degree; his originality is the moreintact and the more genial.On the other hand, Rabelais has been several times trans-lated into German. In the present century Regis publishedat Leipsic, from 1831 to 1841, with copious notes, a closeand faithful translation. The first one cannot be so described,that of Johann Fischart, a native of Mainz or Strasburg, whodied in 1614. He was a Protestant controversialist, and asatirist of fantastic and abundant imagination. In 1575 ap-peared his translation of Rabelais’ first book, and in 1590 hepublished the comic catalogue of the library of Saint Victor,borrowed from the second book. It is not a translation, but arecast in the boldest style, full of alterations and of exaggera-tions, both as regards the coarse expressions which he tookupon himself to develop and to add to, and in the attacks onthe Roman Catholic Church. According to Jean Paul Rich-ter, Fischart is much superior to Rabelais in style and in thefruitfulness of his ideas, and his equal in erudition and in theinvention of new expressions after the manner ofAristophanes. He is sure that his work was successful, be-cause it was often reprinted during his lifetime; but this en-thusiasm of Jean Paul would hardly carry conviction inFrance. Who treads in another’s footprints must follow in"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"13Rabelaisthe rear. Instead of a creator, he is but an imitator. Thosewho take the ideas of others to modify them, and make ofthem creations of their own, like Shakespeare in England,Moliere and La Fontaine in France, may be superior to thosewho have served them with suggestions; but then the newworks must be altogether different, must exist by themselves.Shakespeare and the others, when they imitated, may be saidalways to have destroyed their models. These copyists, if wecall them so, created such works of genius that the only pityis they are so rare. This is not the case with Fischart, but itwould be none the less curious were some one thoroughlyfamiliar with German to translate Fischart for us, or at least,by long extracts from him, give an idea of the vagaries ofGerman taste when it thought it could do better thanRabelais. It is dangerous to tamper with so great a work, andhe who does so runs a great risk of burning his fingers.England has been less daring, and her modesty and discre-tion have brought her success. But, before speaking ofUrquhart’s translation, it is but right to mention the En-glish-French Dictionary of Randle Cotgrave, the first edi-tion of which dates from 1611. It is in every way exceedinglyvaluable, and superior to that of Nicot, because instead ofkeeping to the plane of classic and Latin French, it showed anacquaintance with and mastery of the popular tongue as wellas of the written and learned language. As a foreigner, Cotgraveis a little behind in his information. He is not aware of all thechanges and novelties of the passing fashion. The Pleiad Schoolhe evidently knew nothing of, but kept to the writers of thefifteenth and the first half of the sixteenth century. Thus wordsout of Rabelais, which he always translates with admirableskill, are frequent, and he attaches to them their author’s name.So Rabelais had already crossed the Channel, and was read inhis own tongue. Somewhat later, during the full sway of theCommonwealth—and Maitre Alcofribas Nasier must havebeen a surprising apparition in the midst of Puritan severity—Captain Urquhart undertook to translate him and to natural-ize him completely in England.Thomas Urquhart belonged to a very old family of goodstanding in the North of Scotland. After studying in Aber-deen he travelled in France, Spain, and Italy, where his swordwas as active as that intelligent curiosity of his which is evi-denced by his familiarity with three languages and the large"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"14Gargantua & Pantagruellibrary which he brought back, according to his own account,from sixteen countries he had visited.On his return to England he entered the service of CharlesI., who knighted him in 1641. Next year, after the death ofhis father, he went to Scotland to set his family affairs inorder, and to redeem his house in Cromarty. But, in spite ofanother sojourn in foreign lands, his efforts to free himselffrom pecuniary embarrassments were unavailing. At the king’sdeath his Scottish loyalty caused him to side with those whoopposed the Parliament. Formally proscribed in 1649, takenprisoner at the defeat of Worcester in 1651, stripped of allhis belongings, he was brought to London, but was releasedon parole at Cromwell’s recommendation. After receivingpermission to spend five months in Scotland to try once moreto settle his affairs, he came back to London to escape fromhis creditors. And there he must have died, though the dateof his death is unknown. It probably took place after 1653,the date of the publication of the two first books, and afterhaving written the translation of the third, which was notprinted from his manuscript till the end of the seventeenthcentury.His life was therefore not without its troubles, and literaryactivity must have been almost his only consolation. Hiswritings reveal him as the strangest character, fantastic, andfull of a naive vanity, which, even at the time he was translat-ing the genealogy of Gargantua—surely well calculated tocure any pondering on his own—caused him to trace hisunbroken descent from Adam, and to state that his familyname was derived from his ancestor Esormon, Prince ofAchaia, 2139 B.C., who was surnamed (Greek), that is tosay the Fortunate and the Well-beloved. A Gascon could nothave surpassed this.Gifted as he was, learned in many directions, an enthusi-astic mathematician, master of several languages, occasion-ally full of wit and humour, and even good sense, yet he gavehis books the strangest titles, and his ideas were no less whim-sical. His style is mystic, fastidious, and too often of a weari-some length and obscurity; his verses rhyme anyhow, or notat all; but vivacity, force and heat are never lacking, and theMaitland Club did well in reprinting, in 1834, his variousworks, which are very rare. Yet, in spite of their curious in-terest, he owes his real distinction and the survival of his"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"15Rabelaisname to his translation of Rabelais.The first two books appeared in 1653. The original edi-tion, exceedingly scarce, was carefully reprinted in 1838, onlya hundred copies being issued, by an English bibliophileT(heodore) M(artin), whose interesting preface I regret tosum up so cursorily. At the end of the seventeenth century,in 1693, a French refugee, Peter Antony Motteux, whoseEnglish verses and whose plays are not without value, pub-lished in a little octavo volume a reprint, very incorrect as tothe text, of the first two books, to which he added the third,from the manuscript found amongst Urquhart’s papers. Thesuccess which attended this venture suggested to Motteuxthe idea of completing the work, and a second edition, intwo volumes, appeared in 1708, with the translation of thefourth and fifth books, and notes. Nineteen years after hisdeath, John Ozell, translator on a large scale of French, Ital-ian, and Spanish authors, revised Motteux’s edition, whichhe published in five volumes in 1737, adding Le Duchat’snotes; and this version has often been reprinted since.The continuation by Motteux, who was also the translatorof Don Quixote, has merits of its own. It is precise, elegant,and very faithful. Urquhart’s, without taking liberties withRabelais like Fischart, is not always so closely literal and ex-act. Nevertheless, it is much superior to Motteux’s. IfUrquhart does not constantly adhere to the form of the ex-pression, if he makes a few slight additions, not only has hean understanding of the original, but he feels it, and rendersthe sense with a force and a vivacity full of warmth and bril-liancy. His own learning made the comprehension of thework easy to him, and his anglicization of words fabricatedby Rabelais is particularly successful. The necessity of keep-ing to his text prevented his indulgence in the convolutionsand divagations dictated by his exuberant fancy when writ-ing on his own account. His style, always full of life andvigour, is here balanced, lucid, and picturesque. Never else-where did he write so well. And thus the translation repro-duces the very accent of the original, besides possessing avery remarkable character of its own. Such a literary toneand such literary qualities are rarely found in a translation.Urquhart’s, very useful for the interpretation of obscure pas-sages, may, and indeed should be read as a whole, both forRabelais and for its own merits."},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"16Gargantua & PantagruelHolland, too, possesses a translation of Rabelais. They knewFrench in that country in the seventeenth century better thanthey do to-day, and there Rabelais’ works were reprinted whenno editions were appearing in France. This Dutch transla-tion was published at Amsterdam in 1682, by J. Tenhoorn.The name attached to it, Claudio Gallitalo (Claudius French-Italian) must certainly be a pseudonym. Only a Dutch scholarcould identify the translator, and state the value to be as-signed to his work.Rabelais’ style has many different sources. Besides its forceand brilliancy, its gaiety, wit, and dignity, its abundant rich-ness is no less remarkable. It would be impossible and uselessto compile a glossary of Voltaire’s words. No French writer hasused so few, and all of them are of the simplest. There is notone of them that is not part of the common speech, or whichdemands a note or an explanation. Rabelais’ vocabulary, onthe other hand, is of an astonishing variety. Where does it allcome from? As a fact, he had at his command something likethree languages, which he used in turn, or which he mixedaccording to the effect he wished to produce.First of all, of course, he had ready to his hand the wholespeech of his time, which had no secrets for him. Provincialshave been too eager to appropriate him, to make of him alocal author, the pride of some village, in order that theirdistrict might have the merit of being one of the causes, oneof the factors of his genius. Every neighbourhood where heever lived has declared that his distinction was due to hisknowledge of its popular speech. But these dialect-patriotshave fallen out among themselves. To which dialect was heindebted? Was it that of Touraine, or Berri, or Poitou, orParis? It is too often forgotten, in regard to French patois—leaving out of count the languages of the South—that thewords or expressions that are no longer in use to-day are buta survival, a still living trace of the tongue and the pronun-ciation of other days. Rabelais, more than any other writer,took advantage of the happy chances and the richness of thepopular speech, but he wrote in French, and nothing butFrench. That is why he remains so forcible, so lucid, and soliving, more living even—speaking only of his style out ofcharity to the others—than any of his contemporaries.It has been said that great French prose is solely the workof the seventeenth century. There were nevertheless, before"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"17Rabelaisthat, two men, certainly very different and even hostile, whowere its initiators and its masters, Calvin on the one hand,on the other Rabelais.Rabelais had a wonderful knowledge of the prose and theverse of the fifteenth century: he was familiar with Villon,Pathelin, the Quinze Joies de Mariage, the Cent Nouvelles,the chronicles and the romances, and even earlier works, too,such as the Roman de la Rose. Their words, their turns ofexpression came naturally to his pen, and added a piquancyand, as it were, a kind of gloss of antique novelty to his work.He fabricated words, too, on Greek and Latin models, withgreat ease, sometimes audaciously and with needless fre-quency. These were for him so many means, so many ele-ments of variety. Sometimes he did this in mockery, as in thehumorous discourse of the Limousin scholar, for which he isnot a little indebted to Geoffroy Tory in the Champfleury;sometimes, on the contrary, seriously, from a habit acquiredin dealing with classical tongues.Again, another reason of the richness of his vocabularywas that he invented and forged words for himself. Follow-ing the example of Aristophanes, he coined an enormousnumber of interminable words, droll expressions, sudden andsurprising constructions. What had made Greece and theAthenians laugh was worth transporting to Paris.With an instrument so rich, resources so endless, and theskill to use them, it is no wonder that he could give voice toanything, be as humorous as he could be serious, as comic ashe could be grave, that he could express himself and every-body else, from the lowest to the highest. He had every colouron his palette, and such skill was in his fingers that he coulddepict every variety of light and shade.We have evidence that Rabelais did not always write in thesame fashion. The Chronique Gargantuaine is uniform instyle and quite simple, but cannot with certainty be attrib-uted to him. His letters are bombastic and thin; his few at-tempts at verse are heavy, lumbering, and obscure, altogetherlacking in harmony, and quite as bad as those of his friend,Jean Bouchet. He had no gift of poetic form, as indeed isevident even from his prose. And his letters from Rome tothe Bishop of Maillezais, interesting as they are in regard tothe matter, are as dull, bare, flat, and dry in style as possible.Without his signature no one would possibly have thought"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"18Gargantua & Pantagruelof attributing them to him. He is only a literary artist whenhe wishes to be such; and in his romance he changes thestyle completely every other moment: it has no constant char-acter or uniform manner, and therefore unity is almost en-tirely wanting in his work, while his endeavours after con-trast are unceasing. There is throughout the whole the evi-dence of careful and conscious elaboration.Hence, however lucid and free be the style of his romance,and though its flexibility and ease seem at first sight to havecost no trouble at all, yet its merit lies precisely in the factthat it succeeds in concealing the toil, in hiding the seams.He could not have reached this perfection at a first attempt.He must have worked long at the task, revised it again andagain, corrected much, and added rather than cut away. Theaptness of form and expression has been arrived at by delib-erate means, and owes nothing to chance. Apart from thetoning down of certain bold passages, to soften their effect,and appease the storm—for these were not literary alterations,but were imposed on him by prudence—one can see hownumerous are the variations in his text, how necessary it is totake account of them, and to collect them. A good edition,of course, would make no attempt at amalgamating these.That would give a false impression and end in confusion;but it should note them all, and show them all, not com-bined, but simply as variations.After Le Duchat, all the editions, in their care that noth-ing should be lost, made the mistake of collecting and plac-ing side by side things which had no connection with eachother, which had even been substituted for each other. Theresult was a fabricated text, full of contradictions naturally.But since the edition issued by M. Jannet, the well-knownpublisher of the Bibliotheque Elzevirienne, who was the firstto get rid of this patchwork, this mosaic, Rabelais’ latest texthas been given, accompanied by all the earlier variations, toshow the changes he made, as well as his suppressions andadditions. It would also be possible to reverse the method. Itwould be interesting to take his first text as the basis, notingthe later modifications. This would be quite as instructiveand really worth doing. Perhaps one might then see moreclearly with what care he made his revisions, after what fash-ion he corrected, and especially what were the additions hemade."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"19RabelaisNo more striking instance can be quoted than the admi-rable chapter about the shipwreck. It was not always so longas Rabelais made it in the end: it was much shorter at first.As a rule, when an author recasts some passage that he wishesto revise, he does so by rewriting the whole, or at least byinterpolating passages at one stroke, so to speak. Nothing ofthe kind is seen here. Rabelais suppressed nothing, modifiednothing; he did not change his plan at all. What he did wasto make insertions, to slip in between two clauses a new one.He expressed his meaning in a lengthier way, and the formerclause is found in its integrity along with the additional one,of which it forms, as it were, the warp. It was by this methodof touching up the smallest details, by making here and theresuch little noticeable additions, that he succeeded in height-ening the effect without either change or loss. In the end itlooks as if he had altered nothing, added nothing new, as if ithad always been so from the first, and had never beenmeddled with.The comparison is most instructive, showing us to whatan extent Rabelais’ admirable style was due to conscious ef-fort, care, and elaboration, a fact which is generally too muchoverlooked, and how instead of leaving any trace which wouldreveal toil and study, it has on the contrary a marvellous co-hesion, precision, and brilliancy. It was modelled and remod-elled, repaired, touched up, and yet it has all the appearanceof having been created at a single stroke, or of having beenrun like molten wax into its final form.Something should be said here of the sources from whichRabelais borrowed. He was not the first in France to satirizethe romances of chivalry. The romance in verse by Baudouinde Sebourc, printed in recent years, was a parody of the Chan-sons de Geste. In the Moniage Guillaume, and especially inthe Moniage Rainouart, in which there is a kind of giant,and occasionally a comic giant, there are situations and sceneswhich remind us of Rabelais. The kind of Fabliaux in mono-rhyme quatrains of the old Aubery anticipate his coarse andpopular jests. But all that is beside the question; Rabelais didnot know these. Nothing is of direct interest save what wasknown to him, what fell under his eyes, what lay to hishand—as the Facetiae of Poggio, and the last sermonnaires.In the course of one’s reading one may often enough comeacross the origin of some of Rabelais’ witticisms; here and"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"20Gargantua & Pantagruelthere we may discover how he had developed a situation.While gathering his materials wherever he could find them,he was nevertheless profoundly original.On this point much research and investigation might beemployed. But there is no need why these researches shouldbe extended to the region of fancy. Gargantua has been provedby some to be of Celtic origin. Very often he is a solar myth,and the statement that Rabelais only collected popular tra-ditions and gave new life to ancient legends is said to beproved by the large number of megalithic monuments towhich is attached and name of Gargantua. It was, of course,quite right to make a list of these, to draw up, as it were, achart of them, but the conclusion is not justified. The name,instead of being earlier, is really later, and is a witness, not tothe origin, but to the success and rapid popularity of hisnovel. No one has ever yet produced a written passage or anyancient testimony to prove the existence of the name beforeRabelais. To place such a tradition on a sure basis, positivetraces must be forthcoming; and they cannot be adducedeven for the most celebrated of these monuments, since hementions himself the great menhir near Poitiers, which hechristened by the name of Passelourdin. That there is some-thing in the theory is possible. Perrault found the subjects ofhis stories in the tales told by mothers and nurses. He fixedthem finally by writing them down. Floating about vaguelyas they were, he seized them, worked them up, gave themshape, and yet of scarcely any of them is there to be foundbefore his time a single trace. So we must resign ourselves toknow just as little of what Gargantua and Pantagruel werebefore the sixteenth century.In a book of a contemporary of Rabelais, the Legende dePierre Faifeu by the Angevin, Charles de Bourdigne, the firstedition of which dates from 1526 and the second 1531—both so rare and so forgotten that the work is only knownsince the eighteenth century by the reprint of Custelier—inthe introductory ballad which recommends this book to read-ers, occur these lines in the list of popular books which Faifeuwould desire to replace:‘Laissez ester Caillette le folastre,Les quatre filz Aymon vestuz de bleu,Gargantua qui a cheveux de plastre.’"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"21RabelaisHe has not ‘cheveux de plastre’ in Rabelais. If the rhymehad not suggested the phrase—and the exigencies of the strictform of the ballade and its forced repetitions often imposedan idea which had its whole origin in the rhyme—we mighthere see a dramatic trace found nowhere else. The name ofPantagruel is mentioned too, incidentally, in a Mystery ofthe fifteenth century. These are the only references to thenames which up till now have been discovered, and they are,as one sees, of but little account.On the other hand, the influence of Aristophanes and ofLucian, his intimate acquaintance with nearly all the writersof antiquity, Greek as well as Latin, with whom Rabelais ismore permeated even than Montaigne, were a mine of inspi-ration. The proof of it is everywhere. Pliny especially was hisencyclopaedia, his constant companion. All he says of thePantagruelian herb, though he amply developed it for him-self, is taken from Pliny’s chapter on flax. And there is a greatdeal more of this kind to be discovered, for Rabelais doesnot always give it as quotation. On the other hand, when hewrites, ‘Such an one says,’ it would be difficult enough tofind who is meant, for the ‘such an one’ is a fictitious writer.The method is amusing, but it is curious to account of it.The question of the Chronique Gargantuaine is still un-decided. Is it by Rabelais or by someone else? Both theoriesare defensible, and can be supported by good reasons. In theChronique everything is heavy, occasionally meaningless, andnearly always insipid. Can the same man have written theChronique and Gargantua, replaced a book really common-place by a masterpiece, changed the facts and incidents, trans-formed a heavy icy pleasantry into a work glowing with witand life, made it no longer a mass of laborious trifling andcold-blooded exaggerations but a satire on human life of thehighest genius? Still there are points common to the two.Besides, Rabelais wrote other things; and it is only in hisromance that he shows literary skill. The conception of itwould have entered his mind first only in a bare and sum-mary fashion. It would have been taken up again, expanded,developed, metamorphosed. That is possible, and, for mypart, I am of those who, like Brunet and Nodier, are inclinedto think that the Chronique, in spite of its inferiority, is re-ally a first attempt, condemned as soon as the idea was con-ceived in another form. As its earlier date is incontestable,"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"22Gargantua & Pantagruelwe must conclude that if the Chronique is not by him, hisGargantua and its continuation would not have existed with-out it. This should be a great obligation to stand under tosome unknown author, and in that case it is astonishing thathis enemies did not reproach him during his lifetime withbeing merely an imitator and a plagiarist. So there are rea-sons for and against his authorship of it, and it would bedangerous to make too bold an assertion.One fact which is absolutely certain and beyond all con-troversy, is that Rabelais owed much to one of his contem-poraries, an Italian, to the Histoire Macaronique of MerlinCoccaie. Its author, Theophilus Folengo, who was also amonk, was born in 1491, and died only a short time beforeRabelais, in 1544. But his burlesque poem was published in1517. It was in Latin verse, written in an elaborately fabri-cated style. It is not dog Latin, but Latin ingeniouslyitalianized, or rather Italian, even Mantuan, latinized. Thecontrast between the modern form of the word and its Ro-man garb produces the most amusing effect. In the originalit is sometimes difficult to read, for Folengo has no objec-tion to using the most colloquial words and phrases.The subject is quite different. It is the adventures of Baldo,son of Guy de Montauban, the very lively history of his youth,his trial, imprisonment and deliverance, his journey in searchof his father, during which he visits the Planets and Hell.The narration is constantly interrupted by incidental adven-tures. Occasionally they are what would be called to-day verynaturalistic, and sometimes they are madly extravagant.But Fracasso, Baldo’s friend, is a giant; another friend,Cingar, who delivers him, is Panurge exactly, and quite asmuch given to practical joking. The women in the senileamour of the old Tognazzo, the judges, and the poor ser-geants, are no more gently dealt with by Folengo than by themonk of the Iles d’Hyeres. If Dindenaut’s name does notoccur, there are the sheep. The tempest is there, and the in-vocation to all the saints. Rabelais improves all he borrows,but it is from Folengo he starts. He does not reproduce thewords, but, like the Italian, he revels in drinking scenes,junkettings, gormandizing, battles, scuffles, wounds andcorpses, magic, witches, speeches, repeated enumerations,lengthiness, and a solemnly minute precision of impossibledates and numbers. The atmosphere, the tone, the methods"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"23Rabelaisare the same, and to know Rabelais well, you must knowFolengo well too.Detailed proof of this would be too lengthy a matter; onewould have to quote too many passages, but on this ques-tion of sources nothing is more interesting than a perusal ofthe Opus Macaronicorum. It was translated into French onlyin 1606—Paris, Gilley Robinot. This translation of coursecannot reproduce all the many amusing forms of words, butit is useful, nevertheless, in showing more clearly the pointsof resemblance between the two works,—how far in form,ideas, details, and phrases Rabelais was permeated by Folengo.The anonymous translator saw this quite well, and said so inhis title, ‘Histoire macaronique de Merlin Coccaie, proto-type of Rabelais.’ It is nothing but the truth, and Rabelais,who does not hide it from himself, on more than one occa-sion mentions the name of Merlin Coccaie.Besides, Rabelais was fed on the Italians of his time as onthe Greeks and Romans. Panurge, who owes much to Cingar,is also not free from obligations to the miscreant Marguttein the Morgante Maggiore of Pulci. Had Rabelais in his mindthe tale from the Florentine Chronicles, how in theSavonarola riots, when the Piagnoni and the Arrabiati cameto blows in the church of the Dominican convent of San-Marco, Fra Pietro in the scuffle broke the heads of the assail-ants with the bronze crucifix he had taken from the altar? Awell-handled cross could so readily be used as a weapon, thatprobably it has served as such more than once, and otherand even quite modern instances might be quoted.But other Italian sources are absolutely certain. There arefew more wonderful chapters in Rabelais than the one aboutthe drinkers. It is not a dialogue: those short exclamations ex-ploding from every side, all referring to the same thing, neverrepeating themselves, and yet always varying the same theme.At the end of the Novelle of Gentile Sermini of Siena, there isa chapter called Il Giuoco della pugna, the Game of Battle.Here are the first lines of it: ‘Apre, apre, apre. Chi gioca, chigioca—uh, uh!—A Porrione, a Porrione.—Viela, viela; date aognuno.—Alle mantella, alle mantella.—Oltre di corsa; nonvi fermate.—Voltate qui; ecco costoro; fate veli innanzi.—Viela,viela; date costi.—Chi la fa? Io—Ed io.—Dagli; ah, ah, buonafu.—Or cosi; alla mascella, al fianco.—Dagli basso; di punta,di punta.—Ah, ah, buon gioco, buon gioco.’"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"24Gargantua & PantagruelAnd thus it goes on with fire and animation for pages.Rabelais probably translated or directly imitated it. Hechanged the scene; there was no giuooco della pugna inFrance. He transferred to a drinking-bout this clatter of ex-clamations which go off by themselves, which cross each otherand get no answer. He made a wonderful thing of it. Butthough he did not copy Sermini, yet Sermini’s work pro-vided him with the form of the subject, and was the themefor Rabelais’ marvellous variations.Who does not remember the fantastic quarrel of the cookwith the poor devil who had flavoured his dry bread with thesmoke of the roast, and the judgment of Seyny John, trulyworthy of Solomon? It comes from the Cento Novelle Antiche,rewritten from tales older than Boccaccio, and moreover of anextreme brevity and dryness. They are only the framework,the notes, the skeleton of tales. The subject is often wonder-ful, but nothing is made of it: it is left unshaped. Rabelaiswrote a version of one, the ninth. The scene takes place, not atParis, but at Alexandria in Egypt among the Saracens, and thecook is called Fabrac. But the surprise at the end, the saga-cious judgment by which the sound of a piece of money wasmade the price of the smoke, is the same. Now the first datededition of the Cento Novelle (which were frequently reprinted)appeared at Bologna in 1525, and it is certain that Rabelaishad read the tales. And there would be much else of the samekind to learn if we knew Rabelais’ library.A still stranger fact of this sort may be given to show hownothing came amiss to him. He must have known, and evencopied the Latin Chronicle of the Counts of Anjou. It isaccepted, and rightly so, as an historical document, but thatis no reason for thinking that the truth may not have beenmanipulated and adorned. The Counts of Anjou were notsaints. They were proud, quarrelsome, violent, rapacious, andextravagant, as greedy as they were charitable to the Church,treacherous and cruel. Yet their anonymous panegyrist hasmade them patterns of all the virtues. In reality it is both ahistory and in some sort a romance; especially is it a collec-tion of examples worthy of being followed, in the style ofthe Cyropaedia, our Juvenal of the fifteenth century, and alittle like Fenelon’s Telemaque. Now in it there occurs theaddress of one of the counts to those who rebelled againsthim and who were at his mercy. Rabelais must have known"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"25Rabelaisit, for he has copied it, or rather, literally translated wholelines of it in the wonderful speech of Gargantua to the van-quished. His contemporaries, who approved of his borrow-ing from antiquity, could not detect this one, because thebook was not printed till much later. But Rabelais lived inMaine. In Anjou, which often figures among the localitieshe names, he must have met with and read the Chronicles ofthe Counts in manuscript, probably in some monastery li-brary, whether at Fontenay-le-Comte or elsewhere it matterslittle. There is not only a likeness in the ideas and tone, butin the words too, which cannot be a mere matter of chance.He must have known the Chronicles of the Counts of Anjou,and they inspired one of his finest pages. One sees, there-fore, how varied were the sources whence he drew, and howmany of them must probably always escape us.When, as has been done for Moliere, a critical bibliogra-phy of the works relating to Rabelais is drawn up—which,by the bye, will entail a very great amount of labour—theeasiest part will certainly be the bibliography of the old edi-tions. That is the section that has been most satisfactorilyand most completely worked out. M. Brunet said the lastword on the subject in his Researches in 1852, and in theimportant article in the fifth edition of his Manuel du Libraire(iv., 1863, pp. 1037-1071).The facts about the fifth book cannot be summed up briefly.It was printed as a whole at first, without the name of theplace, in 1564, and next year at Lyons by Jean Martin. It hasgiven, and even still gives rise to two contradictory opinions.Is it Rabelais’ or not?First of all, if he had left it complete, would sixteen yearshave gone by before it was printed? Then, does it bear evidentmarks of his workmanship? Is the hand of the master visiblethroughout? Antoine Du Verdier in the 1605 edition of hisProsopographie writes: ‘(Rabelais’) misfortune has been thateverybody has wished to “pantagruelize!” and several bookshave appeared under his name, and have been added to hisworks, which are not by him, as, for instance, l’Ile Sonnante,written by a certain scholar of Valence and others.’The scholar of Valence might be Guillaume des Autels, towhom with more certainty can be ascribed the authorship ofa dull imitation of Rabelais, the History of Fanfreluche andGaudichon, published in 1578, which, to say the least of it,"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"26Gargantua & Pantagruelis very much inferior to the fifth book.Louis Guyon, in his Diverses Lecons, is still more positive:‘As to the last book which has been included in his works,entitled l’Ile Sonnante, the object of which seems to be tofind fault with and laugh at the members and the authoritiesof the Catholic Church, I protest that he did not composeit, for it was written long after his death. I was at Paris whenit was written, and I know quite well who was its author; hewas not a doctor.’ That is very emphatic, and it is impossibleto ignore it.Yet everyone must recognize that there is a great deal ofRabelais in the fifth book. He must have planned it and be-gun it. Remembering that in 1548 he had published, not asan experiment, but rather as a bait and as an announcement,the first eleven chapters of the fourth book, we may con-clude that the first sixteen chapters of the fifth book pub-lished by themselves nine years after his death, in 1562, rep-resent the remainder of his definitely finished work. This isthe more certain because these first chapters, which containthe Apologue of the Horse and the Ass and the terrible FurredLaw-cats, are markedly better than what follows them. Theyare not the only ones where the master’s hand may be traced,but they are the only ones where no other hand could possi-bly have interfered.In the remainder the sentiment is distinctly Protestant.Rabelais was much struck by the vices of the clergy and didnot spare them. Whether we are unable to forgive his criti-cisms because they were conceived in a spirit of raillery, orwhether, on the other hand, we feel admiration for him onthis point, yet Rabelais was not in the least a sectary. If hestrongly desired a moral reform, indirectly pointing out theneed of it in his mocking fashion, he was not favourable to apolitical reform. Those who would make of him a Protestantaltogether forget that the Protestants of his time were not forhim, but against him. Henri Estienne, for instance, Ramus,Theodore de Beze, and especially Calvin, should know howhe was to be regarded. Rabelais belonged to what may becalled the early reformation, to that band of honest men inthe beginning of the sixteenth century, precursors of the laterone perhaps, but, like Erasmus, between the two extremes.He was neither Lutheran nor Calvinist, neither German norGenevese, and it is quite natural that his work was not re-"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"27Rabelaisprinted in Switzerland, which would certainly have happenedhad the Protestants looked on him as one of themselves.That Rabelais collected the materials for the fifth book,had begun it, and got on some way, there can be no doubt:the excellence of a large number of passages prove it, but—taken as a whole—the fifth book has not the value, the verve,and the variety of the others. The style is quite different, lessrich, briefer, less elaborate, drier, in parts even wearisome. Inthe first four books Rabelais seldom repeats himself. The fifthbook contains from the point of view of the vocabulary re-ally the least novelty. On the contrary, it is full of words andexpressions already met with, which is very natural in animitation, in a copy, forced to keep to a similar tone, and toshow by such reminders and likenesses that it is really by thesame pen. A very striking point is the profound difference inthe use of anatomical terms. In the other books they are mostfrequently used in a humorous sense, and nonsensically, witha quite other meaning than their own; in the fifth they areapplied correctly. It was necessary to include such terms tokeep up the practice, but the writer has not thought of usingthem to add to the comic effect: one cannot always think ofeverything. Trouble has been taken, of course, to includeenumerations, but there are much fewer fabricated and fan-tastic words. In short, the hand of the maker is far fromshowing the same suppleness and strength.A eulogistic quatrain is signed Nature quite, which, it is gen-erally agreed, is an anagram of Jean Turquet. Did the adapterof the fifth book sign his work in this indirect fashion? Hemight be of the Genevese family to whom Louis Turquet andhis son Theodore belonged, both well-known, and both strongProtestants. The obscurity relating to this matter is far frombeing cleared up, and perhaps never will be.It fell to my lot—here, unfortunately, I am forced to speakof a personal matter—to print for the first time the manu-script of the fifth book. At first it was hoped it might be inRabelais’ own hand; afterwards that it might be at least acopy of his unfinished work. The task was a difficult one, forthe writing, extremely flowing and rapid, is execrable, andmost difficult to decipher and to transcribe accurately. Be-sides, it often happens in the sixteenth and the end of thefifteenth century, that manuscripts are much less correct thanthe printed versions, even when they have not been copied"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"28Gargantua & Pantagruelby clumsy and ignorant hands. In this case, it is the writingof a clerk executed as quickly as possible. The farther it goesthe more incorrect it becomes, as if the writer were in hasteto finish.What is really the origin of it? It has less the appearance ofnotes or fragments prepared by Rabelais than of a first at-tempt at revision. It is not an author’s rough draft; still less isit his manuscript. If I had not printed this enigmatical textwith scrupulous and painful fidelity, I would do it now. Itwas necessary to do it so as to clear the way. But as the thingis done, and accessible to those who may be interested, andwho wish to critically examine it, there is no further need ofreprinting it. All the editions of Rabelais continue, and rightly,to reproduce the edition of 1564. It is not the real Rabelais,but however open to criticism it may be, it was under thatform that the fifth book appeared in the sixteenth century,under that form it was accepted. Consequently it is conve-nient and even necessary to follow and keep to the originaledition.The first sixteen chapters may, and really must be, the textof Rabelais, in the final form as left by him, and found afterhis death; the framework, and a number of the passages inthe continuation, the best ones, of course, are his, but havebeen patched up and tampered with. Nothing can have beensuppressed of what existed; it was evidently thought that ev-erything should be admitted with the final revision; but thetone was changed, additions were made, and ‘improvements.’Adapters are always strangely vain.In the seventeenth century, the French printing-press, savefor an edition issued at Troyes in 1613, gave up publishingRabelais, and the work passed to foreign countries. Jean Fuetreprinted him at Antwerp in 1602. After the Amsterdamedition of 1659, where for the first time appears ‘The Al-phabet of the French Author,’ comes the Elzevire edition of1663. The type, an imitation of what made the reputationof the little volumes of the Gryphes of Lyons, is charming,the printing is perfect, and the paper, which is French—thedevelopment of paper-making in Holland and England didnot take place till after the Revocation of the Edict ofNantes—is excellent. They are pretty volumes to the eye,but, as in all the reprints of the seventeenth century, the textis full of faults and most untrustworthy."},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"29RabelaisFrance, through a representative in a foreign land, how-ever, comes into line again in the beginning of the eighteenthcentury, and in a really serious fashion, thanks to the veryconsiderable learning of a French refugee, Jacob Le Duchat,who died in 1748. He had a most thorough knowledge ofthe French prose-writers of the sixteenth century, and he madethem accessible by his editions of the Quinze Joies duMariage, of Henri Estienne, of Agrippa d’Aubigne, of L’Etoile,and of the Satyre Menippee. In 1711 he published an edi-tion of Rabelais at Amsterdam, through Henry Bordesius,in five duodecimo volumes. The reprint in quarto which heissued in 1741, seven years before his death, is, with its en-gravings by Bernard Picot, a fine library edition. Le Duchat’sis the first of the critical editions. It takes account of differ-ences in the texts, and begins to point out the variations. Hisvery numerous notes are remarkable, and are still worthy ofmost serious consideration. He was the first to offer usefulelucidations, and these have been repeated after him, andwith good reason will continue to be so. The Abbe de Massy’sedition of 1752, also an Amsterdam production, has madeuse of Le Duchat’s but does not take its place. Finally, at endof the century, Cazin printed Rabelais in his little volume, in1782, and Bartiers issued two editions (of no importance) atParis in 1782 and 1798. Fortunately the nineteenth centuryhas occupied itself with the great ‘Satyrique’ in a more com-petent and useful fashion.In 1820 L’Aulnaye published through Desoer his three littlevolumes, printed in exquisite style, and which have othermerits besides. His volume of annotations, in which, thatnothing might be lost of his own notes, he has included manythings not directly relating to Rabelais, is full of observa-tions and curious remarks which are very useful additions toLe Duchat. One fault to be found with him is his furthercomplication of the spelling. This he did in accordance witha principle that the words should be referred to their realetymology. Learned though he was, Rabelais had little careto be so etymological, and it is not his theories but those ofthe modern scholar that have been ventilated.Somewhat later, from 1823 to 1826, Esmangart andJohanneau issued a variorum edition in nine volumes, inwhich the text is often encumbered by notes which are reallytoo numerous, and, above all, too long. The work was an"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"30Gargantua & Pantagruelenormous one, but the best part of it is Le Duchat’s, andwhat is not his is too often absolutely hypothetical and be-side the truth. Le Duchat had already given too much im-portance to the false historical explanation. Here it is con-stantly coming in, and it rests on no evidence. In reality,there is no need of the key to Rabelais by which to discoverthe meaning of subtle allusions. He is neither so complicatednor so full of riddles. We know how he has scattered the namesof contemporaries about his work, sometimes of friends, some-times of enemies, and without disguising them under any mask.He is no more Panurge than Louis XII. is Gargantua or FrancisI. Pantagruel. Rabelais says what he wants, all he wants, andin the way he wants. There are no mysteries below the surface,and it is a waste of time to look for knots in a bulrush. All thehistorical explanations are purely imaginary, utterly withoutproof, and should the more emphatically be looked on as base-less and dismissed. They are radically false, and therefore bothworthless and harmful.In 1840 there appeared in the Bibliotheque Charpentierthe Rabelais in a single duodecimo volume, begun by CharlesLabiche, and, after his death, completed by M. Paul Lacroix,whose share is the larger. The text is that of L’Aulnaye; theshort footnotes, with all their brevity, contain useful expla-nations of difficult words. Amongst the editions of Rabelaisthis is one of the most important, because it brought himmany readers and admirers. No other has made him so welland so widely known as this portable volume, which hasbeen constantly reprinted. No other has been so widely cir-culated, and the sale still goes on. It was, and must still belooked on as a most serviceable edition.The edition published by Didot in 1857 has an altogetherspecial character. In the biographical notice M. Rathery forthe first time treated as they deserve the foolish prejudiceswhich have made Rabelais misunderstood, and M. Burgauddes Marets set the text on a quite new base. Having proved,what of course is very evident, that in the original editionsthe spelling, and the language too, were of the simplest andclearest, and were not bristling with the nonsensical and su-perfluous consonants which have given rise to the idea thatRabelais is difficult to read, he took the trouble first of all tonote the spelling of each word. Whenever in a single instancehe found it in accordance with modern spelling, he made it"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"31Rabelaisthe same throughout. The task was a hard one, and Rabelaiscertainly gained in clearness, but over-zeal is often fatal to areform. In respect to its precision and the value of its notes,which are short and very judicious, Burgaud des Marets’ edi-tion is valuable, and is amongst those which should be knownand taken into account.Since Le Duchat all the editions have a common fault.They are not exactly guilty of fabricating, but they set up anartificial text in the sense that, in order to lose as little aspossible, they have collected and united what originally werevariations—the revisions, in short, of the original editions.Guided by the wise counsels given by Brunet in 1852 in hisResearches on the old editions of Rabelais, Pierre Jannet pub-lished the first three books in 1858; then, when the publica-tion of the Bibliotheque Elzevirienne was discontinued, hetook up the work again and finished the edition in Picard’sblue library, in little volumes, each book quite distinct. Itwas M. Jannet who in our days first restored the pure andexact text of Rabelais, not only without retouching it, butwithout making additions or insertions, or juxtaposition ofthings that were not formerly found together. For each ofthe books he has followed the last edition issued by Rabelais,and all the earlier differences he gives as variations. It is as-tonishing that a thing so simple and so fitting should nothave been done before, and the result is that this absolutelyexact fidelity has restored a lucidity which was not wantingin Rabelais’s time, but which had since been obscured. Allwho have come after Jannet have followed in his path, andthere is no reason for straying from it."},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"32Gargantua & PantagruelTHE FIRST BOOKTHE FIRST BOOKTHE FIRST BOOKTHE FIRST BOOKTHE FIRST BOOKTTTTTo the Ho the Ho the Ho the Ho the Honouronouronouronouronoured, Ned, Ned, Ned, Ned, Noble oble oble oble oble TTTTTranslator of Rabelais.ranslator of Rabelais.ranslator of Rabelais.ranslator of Rabelais.ranslator of Rabelais.Rabelais, whose wit prodigiously was made,All men, professions, actions to invade,With so much furious vigour, as if itHad lived o’er each of them, and each had quit,Yet with such happy sleight and careless skill,As, like the serpent, doth with laughter kill,So that although his noble leaves appearAntic and Gottish, and dull souls forbearTo turn them o’er, lest they should only findNothing but savage monsters of a mind,—No shapen beauteous thoughts; yet when the wiseSeriously strip him of his wild disguise,Melt down his dross, refine his massy ore,And polish that which seem’d rough-cast before,Search his deep sense, unveil his hidden mirth,And make that fiery which before seem’d earth(Conquering those things of highest consequence,What’s difficult of language or of sense),He will appear some noble table writIn the old Egyptian hieroglyphic wit;Where, though you monsters and grotescoes see,You meet all mysteries of philosophy.For he was wise and sovereignly bredTo know what mankind is, how ‘t may be led:He stoop’d unto them, like that wise man, whoRid on a stick, when ‘s children would do so.For we are easy sullen things, and mustBe laugh’d aright, and cheated into trust;Whilst a black piece of phlegm, that lays aboutDull menaces, and terrifies the rout,And cajoles it, with all its peevish strengthPiteously stretch’d and botch’d up into length,Whilst the tired rabble sleepily obeySuch opiate talk, and snore away the day,By all his noise as much their minds relieves,As caterwauling of wild cats frights thieves.But Rabelais was another thing, a man"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"33RabelaisMade up of all that art and nature canForm from a fiery genius,—he was oneWhose soul so universally was thrownThrough all the arts of life, who understoodEach stratagem by which we stray from good;So that he best might solid virtue teach,As some ‘gainst sins of their own bosoms preach:He from wise choice did the true means prefer,In fool’s coat acting th’ philosopher.

To make him every shirt of his were taken up ninehundred ells of Chasteleraud linen, and two hundred for thegussets, in manner of cushions, which they put under hisarmpits. His shirt was not gathered nor plaited, for the plait-ing of shirts was not found out till the seamstresses (whenthe point of their needle (Besongner du cul, Englished Theeye of the needle.) was broken) began to work and occupywith the tail.

Then was itthat men began to tie their breeches to their doublets, andnot their doublets to their breeches: for it is against nature,as hath most amply been showed by Ockham upon theexponibles of Master Haultechaussade.For his breeches were taken up eleven hundred and fiveells and a third of white broadcloth.

For his plume, he wore afair great blue feather, plucked from an onocrotal of the coun-try of Hircania the wild, very prettily hanging down over hisright ear. For the jewel or brooch which in his cap he carried,he had in a cake of gold, weighing three score and eight marks,a fair piece enamelled, wherein was portrayed a man’s bodywith two heads, looking towards one another, four arms, fourfeet, two arses, such as Plato, in Symposio, says was the mys-tical beginning of man’s nature; and about it was written inIonic letters, Greek, or rather, Greek, that is, Vir et mulierjunctim propriissime homo. To wear about his neck, he hada golden chain, weighing twenty-five thousand and sixty-three marks of gold, the links thereof being made after themanner of great berries, amongst which were set in workgreen jaspers engraven and cut dragon-like, all environed withbeams and sparks, as king Nicepsos of old was wont to wearthem: and it reached down to the very bust of the rising ofhis belly, whereby he reaped great benefit all his life long, asthe Greek physicians know well enough.

As, for example, virtue and vice are contrary inone kind, so are good and evil. If one of the contraries of thefirst kind be consonant to one of those of the second, asvirtue and goodness, for it is clear that virtue is good, so shallthe other two contraries, which are evil and vice, have the"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"60Gargantua & Pantagruelsame connection, for vice is evil.This logical rule being understood, take these two con-traries, joy and sadness; then these other two, white and black,for they are physically contrary. If so be, then, that black dosignify grief, by good reason then should white import joy.Nor is this signification instituted by human imposition, butby the universal consent of the world received, which phi-losophers call Jus Gentium, the Law of Nations, or an un-controllable right of force in all countries whatsoever. Foryou know well enough that all people, and all languages andnations, except the ancient Syracusans and certain Argives,who had cross and thwarting souls, when they mean out-wardly to give evidence of their sorrow, go in black; and allmourning is done with black. Which general consent is notwithout some argument and reason in nature, the which ev-ery man may by himself very suddenly comprehend, with-out the instruction of any—and this we call the law of na-ture. By virtue of the same natural instinct we know that bywhite all the world hath understood joy, gladness, mirth,pleasure, and delight. In former times the Thracians andCretans did mark their good, propitious, and fortunate dayswith white stones, and their sad, dismal, and unfortunateones with black. Is not the night mournful, sad, and melan-cholic? It is black and dark by the privation of light. Dothnot the light comfort all the world? And it is more whitethan anything else. Which to prove, I could direct you to thebook of Laurentius Valla against Bartolus; but an evangelicaltestimony I hope will content you. Matth. 17 it is said that,at the transfiguration of our Lord, Vestimenta ejus facta suntalba sicut lux, his apparel was made white like the light. Bywhich lightsome whiteness he gave his three apostles to un-derstand the idea and figure of the eternal joys; for by thelight are all men comforted, according to the word of the oldwoman, who, although she had never a tooth in her head,was wont to say, Bona lux. And Tobit, chap.5, after he hadlost his sight, when Raphael saluted him, answered, Whatjoy can I have, that do not see the light of Heaven? In thatcolour did the angels testify the joy of the whole world at theresurrection of our Saviour, John 20, and at his ascension,Acts 1. With the like colour of vesture did St. John the Evan-gelist, Apoc. 4.7, see the faithful clothed in the heavenly andblessed Jerusalem."},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"61RabelaisRead the ancient, both Greek and Latin histories, and youshall find that the town of Alba (the first pattern of Rome)was founded and so named by reason of a white sow that wasseen there. You shall likewise find in those stories, that whenany man, after he had vanquished his enemies, was by decreeof the senate to enter into Rome triumphantly, he usually rodein a chariot drawn by white horses: which in the ovation tri-umph was also the custom; for by no sign or colour wouldthey so significantly express the joy of their coming as by thewhite. You shall there also find, how Pericles, the general ofthe Athenians, would needs have that part of his army untowhose lot befell the white beans, to spend the whole day inmirth, pleasure, and ease, whilst the rest were a-fighting. Athousand other examples and places could I allege to this pur-pose, but that it is not here where I should do it.By understanding hereof, you may resolve one problem,which Alexander Aphrodiseus hath accounted unanswerable:why the lion, who with his only cry and roaring affrights allbeasts, dreads and feareth only a white cock? For, as Proclussaith, Libro de Sacrificio et Magia, it is because the presenceof the virtue of the sun, which is the organ and promptuaryof all terrestrial and sidereal light, doth more symbolize andagree with a white cock, as well in regard of that colour, as ofhis property and specifical quality, than with a lion. He saith,furthermore, that devils have been often seen in the shape oflions, which at the sight of a white cock have presently van-ished. This is the cause why Galli or Gallices (so are theFrenchmen called, because they are naturally white as milk,which the Greeks call Gala,) do willingly wear in their capswhite feathers, for by nature they are of a candid disposition,merry, kind, gracious, and well-beloved, and for their cogni-zance and arms have the whitest flower of any, the Flower deluce or Lily.If you demand how, by white, nature would have us un-derstand joy and gladness, I answer, that the analogy anduniformity is thus. For, as the white doth outwardly disperseand scatter the rays of the sight, whereby the optic spirits aremanifestly dissolved, according to the opinion of Aristotlein his problems and perspective treatises; as you may like-wise perceive by experience, when you pass over mountainscovered with snow, how you will complain that you cannotsee well; as Xenophon writes to have happened to his men,"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"62Gargantua & Pantagrueland as Galen very largely declareth, lib. 10, de usu partium:just so the heart with excessive joy is inwardly dilated, andsuffereth a manifest resolution of the vital spirits, which maygo so far on that it may thereby be deprived of its nourish-ment, and by consequence of life itself, by this perichary orextremity of gladness, as Galen saith, lib. 12, method, lib. 5,de locis affectis, and lib. 2, de symptomatum causis.

The house truly for so many guestsat once was somewhat narrow, but especially the stables;whereupon the steward and harbinger of the said LordBreadinbag, to know if there were any other empty stable inthe house, came to Gargantua, a little young lad, and se-cretly asked him where the stables of the great horses were,thinking that children would be ready to tell all.

Therefore will I commit him tosome learned man, to have him indoctrinated according tohis capacity, and will spare no cost. Presently they appointedhim a great sophister-doctor, called Master Tubal Holofernes,who taught him his ABC so well, that he could say it byheart backwards; and about this he was five years and threemonths. Then read he to him Donat, Le Facet, Theodolet,and Alanus in parabolis. About this he was thirteen years, sixmonths, and two weeks. But you must remark that in themean time he did learn to write in Gothic characters, andthat he wrote all his books—for art of printing was not thenin use—and did ordinarily carry a great pen and inkhorn,weighing about seven thousand quintals (that is, 700,000pound weight), the penner whereof was as big and as long asthe great pillars of Enay, and the horn was hanging to it ingreat iron chains, it being of the wideness of a tun of mer-chant ware.

That it is so, take, said he, any youngboy of this time who hath only studied two years,—if hehave not a better judgment, a better discourse, and that ex-pressed in better terms than your son, with a completer car-riage and civility to all manner of persons, account me forever hereafter a very clounch and bacon-slicer of Brene. Thispleased Grangousier very well, and he commanded that itshould be done. At night at supper, the said Des Maraysbrought in a young page of his, of Ville-gouges, calledEudemon, so neat, so trim, so handsome in his apparel, sospruce, with his hair in so good order, and so sweet andcomely in his behaviour, that he had the resemblance of alittle angel more than of a human creature. Then he said toGrangousier, Do you see this young boy? He is not as yet fulltwelve years old. Let us try, if it please you, what differencethere is betwixt the knowledge of the doting Mateologiansof old time and the young lads that are now. The trial pleasedGrangousier, and he commanded the page to begin. ThenEudemon, asking leave of the vice-king his master so to do,with his cap in his hand, a clear and open countenance, beau-tiful and ruddy lips, his eyes steady, and his looks fixed uponGargantua with a youthful modesty, standing up straight onhis feet, began very gracefully to commend him; first, for his"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"73Rabelaisvirtue and good manners; secondly, for his knowledge, thirdly,for his nobility; fourthly, for his bodily accomplishments;and, in the fifth place, most sweetly exhorted him to rever-ence his father with all due observancy, who was so carefulto have him well brought up. In the end he prayed him, thathe would vouchsafe to admit of him amongst the least of hisservants; for other favour at that time desired he none ofheaven, but that he might do him some grateful and accept-able service. All this was by him delivered with such propergestures, such distinct pronunciation, so pleasant a delivery,in such exquisite fine terms, and so good Latin, that he seemedrather a Gracchus, a Cicero, an Aemilius of the time past,than a youth of this age. But all the countenance thatGargantua kept was, that he fell to crying like a cow, andcast down his face, hiding it with his cap, nor could theypossibly draw one word from him, no more than a fart froma dead ass. Whereat his father was so grievously vexed thathe would have killed Master Jobelin, but the said Des Marayswithheld him from it by fair persuasions, so that at length hepacified his wrath. Then Grangousier commanded he shouldbe paid his wages, that they should whittle him up soundly,like a sophister, with good drink, and then give him leave togo to all the devils in hell. At least, said he, today shall it notcost his host much if by chance he should die as drunk as aSwitzer. Master Jobelin being gone out of the house,Grangousier consulted with the Viceroy what schoolmasterthey should choose for him, and it was betwixt them resolvedthat Ponocrates, the tutor of Eudemon, should have the charge,and that they should go altogether to Paris, to know what wasthe study of the young men of France at that time.Chapter 1.XVI.Chapter 1.XVI.Chapter 1.XVI.Chapter 1.XVI.Chapter 1.XVI.HHHHHooooow Gw Gw Gw Gw Gargantua was sent to Pargantua was sent to Pargantua was sent to Pargantua was sent to Pargantua was sent to Paris, and of the huge graris, and of the huge graris, and of the huge graris, and of the huge graris, and of the huge greateateateateatmarmarmarmarmare that he re that he re that he re that he re that he rode on; hoode on; hoode on; hoode on; hoode on; how she destrw she destrw she destrw she destrw she destroooooyyyyyed the oed the oed the oed the oed the oxflies ofxflies ofxflies ofxflies ofxflies ofthe Bthe Bthe Bthe Bthe Beauce.eauce.eauce.eauce.eauce.In the same season Fayoles, the fourth King of Numidia,sent out of the country of Africa to Grangousier the mosthideously great mare that ever was seen, and of the strangestform, for you know well enough how it is said that Africaalways is productive of some new thing.

Thus did they merrily pass their time in trav-elling on their high way, always making good cheer, and werevery pleasant till they came a little above Orleans, in whichplace there was a forest of five-and-thirty leagues long, andseventeen in breadth, or thereabouts. This forest was mosthorribly fertile and copious in dorflies, hornets, and wasps,so that it was a very purgatory for the poor mares, asses, andhorses. But Gargantua’s mare did avenge herself handsomelyof all the outrages therein committed upon beasts of her kind,and that by a trick whereof they had no suspicion. For assoon as ever they were entered into the said forest, and thatthe wasps had given the assault, she drew out and unsheathedher tail, and therewith skirmishing, did so sweep them thatshe overthrew all the wood alongst and athwart, here andthere, this way and that way, longwise and sidewise, overand under, and felled everywhere the wood with as muchease as a mower doth the grass, in such sort that never since"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"75Rabelaishath there been there neither wood nor dorflies: for all thecountry was thereby reduced to a plain champaign field.Which Gargantua took great pleasure to behold, and said tohis company no more but this: Je trouve beau ce (I find thispretty); whereupon that country hath been ever since thattime called Beauce. But all the breakfast the mare got thatday was but a little yawning and gaping, in memory whereofthe gentlemen of Beauce do as yet to this day break their fastwith gaping, which they find to be very good, and do spitthe better for it. At last they came to Paris, where Gargantuarefreshed himself two or three days, making very merry withhis folks, and inquiring what men of learning there werethen in the city, and what wine they drunk there.Chapter 1.XVII.Chapter 1.XVII.Chapter 1.XVII.Chapter 1.XVII.Chapter 1.XVII.HHHHHooooow Gw Gw Gw Gw Gargantua paid his wargantua paid his wargantua paid his wargantua paid his wargantua paid his welcome to the Pelcome to the Pelcome to the Pelcome to the Pelcome to the Parisians, andarisians, andarisians, andarisians, andarisians, andhohohohohow he took away the grw he took away the grw he took away the grw he took away the grw he took away the great bells of Oeat bells of Oeat bells of Oeat bells of Oeat bells of Our Ladyur Ladyur Ladyur Ladyur Lady’’’’’s Churs Churs Churs Churs Church.ch.ch.ch.ch.Some few days after that they had refreshed themselves, hewent to see the city, and was beheld of everybody there withgreat admiration; for the people of Paris are so sottish, sobadot, so foolish and fond by nature, that a juggler, a carrierof indulgences, a sumpter-horse, or mule with cymbals ortinkling bells, a blind fiddler in the middle of a cross lane,shall draw a greater confluence of people together than anevangelical preacher.

And indeed he forthwith carried them to hislodging. In the meanwhile there came a master beggar of thefriars of St. Anthony to demand in his canting way the usualbenevolence of some hoggish stuff, who, that he might beheard afar off, and to make the bacon he was in quest ofshake in the very chimneys, made account to filch them awayprivily. Nevertheless, he left them behind very honestly, notfor that they were too hot, but that they were somewhat tooheavy for his carriage. This was not he of Bourg, for he wastoo good a friend of mine.

I think she is not therenow. This done, he with all his heart submitted his study tothe discretion of Ponocrates; who for the beginning appointedthat he should do as he was accustomed, to the end he mightunderstand by what means, in so long time, his old mastershad made him so sottish and ignorant. He disposed there-fore of his time in such fashion, that ordinarily he did awakebetwixt eight and nine o’clock, whether it was day or not,for so had his ancient governors ordained, alleging that whichDavid saith, Vanum est vobis ante lucem surgere. Then didhe tumble and toss, wag his legs, and wallow in the bed sometime, the better to stir up and rouse his vital spirits, andapparelled himself according to the season: but willingly hewould wear a great long gown of thick frieze, furred withfox-skins. Afterwards he combed his head with an Almaincomb, which is the four fingers and the thumb. For his pre-ceptor said that to comb himself otherwise, to wash and makehimself neat, was to lose time in this world. Then he dunged,pissed, spewed, belched, cracked, yawned, spitted, coughed,yexed, sneezed and snotted himself like an archdeacon, and,to suppress the dew and bad air, went to breakfast, havingsome good fried tripes, fair rashers on the coals, excellentgammons of bacon, store of fine minced meat, and a greatdeal of sippet brewis, made up of the fat of the beef-pot, laidupon bread, cheese, and chopped parsley strewed together.Ponocrates showed him that he ought not to eat so soonafter rising out of his bed, unless he had performed someexercise beforehand. Gargantua answered, What! have not Isufficiently well exercised myself? I have wallowed and rolledmyself six or seven turns in my bed before I rose. Is not thatenough? Pope Alexander did so, by the advice of a Jew hisphysician, and lived till his dying day in despite of his en-emies.

I am very well after it, and dine but the better. AndMaster Tubal, who was the first licenciate at Paris, told methat it was not enough to run apace, but to set forth betimes:so doth not the total welfare of our humanity depend uponperpetual drinking in a ribble rabble, like ducks, but on drink-ing early in the morning; unde versus, To rise betimes is no good hour, To drink betimes is better sure.After that he had thoroughly broke his fast, he went to church,and they carried to him, in a great basket, a hugeimpantoufled or thick-covered breviary, weighing, what ingrease, clasps, parchment and cover, little more or less thaneleven hundred and six pounds. There he heard six-and-twenty or thirty masses. This while, to the same place camehis orison-mutterer impaletocked, or lapped up about thechin like a tufted whoop, and his breath pretty well anti-doted with store of the vine-tree-syrup. With him hemumbled all his kiriels and dunsical breborions, which he socuriously thumbed and fingered, that there fell not so muchas one grain to the ground. As he went from the church,they brought him, upon a dray drawn with oxen, a confusedheap of paternosters and aves of St. Claude, every one ofthem being of the bigness of a hat-block; and thus walkingthrough the cloisters, galleries, or garden, he said more inturning them over than sixteen hermits would have done.Then did he study some paltry half-hour with his eyes fixedupon his book; but, as the comic saith, his mind was in thekitchen. Pissing then a full urinal, he sat down at table; andbecause he was naturally phlegmatic, he began his meal withsome dozens of gammons, dried neat’s tongues, hard roes ofmullet, called botargos, andouilles or sausages, and such otherforerunners of wine. In the meanwhile, four of his folks didcast into his mouth one after another continually mustardby whole shovelfuls. Immediately after that, he drank a hor-rible draught of white wine for the ease of his kidneys. Whenthat was done, he ate according to the season meat agreeableto his appetite, and then left off eating when his belly beganto strout, and was like to crack for fulness.

After he was awakenedhe would shake his ears a little. In the mean time they broughthim fresh wine. There he drank better than ever. Ponocratesshowed him that it was an ill diet to drink so after sleeping.It is, answered Gargantua, the very life of the patriarchs andholy fathers; for naturally I sleep salt, and my sleep hathbeen to me in stead of so many gammons of bacon. Thenbegan he to study a little, and out came the paternosters orrosary of beads, which the better and more formally to des-patch, he got upon an old mule, which had served nine kings,and so mumbling with his mouth, nodding and doddlinghis head, would go see a coney ferreted or caught in a gin. Athis return he went into the kitchen to know what roast meatwas on the spit, and what otherwise was to be dressed forsupper. And supped very well, upon my conscience, and com-monly did invite some of his neighbours that were gooddrinkers, with whom carousing and drinking merrily, theytold stories of all sorts from the old to the new. Amongstothers he had for domestics the Lords of Fou, of Gourville,of Griniot, and of Marigny. After supper were brought inupon the place the fair wooden gospels and the books of thefour kings, that is to say, many pairs of tables and cards—orthe fair flush, one, two, three—or at all, to make short work;or else they went to see the wenches thereabouts, with littlesmall banquets, intermixed with collations and rear-suppers.Then did he sleep, without unbridling, until eight o’clock inthe next morning.Chapter 1.XXIII.Chapter 1.XXIII.Chapter 1.XXIII.Chapter 1.XXIII.Chapter 1.XXIII.HHHHHooooow Gw Gw Gw Gw Gargantua was instrargantua was instrargantua was instrargantua was instrargantua was instructed bucted bucted bucted bucted by Py Py Py Py Ponocrates, and in suchonocrates, and in suchonocrates, and in suchonocrates, and in suchonocrates, and in suchsorsorsorsorsort disciplinated, that he lost not one hour of the dayt disciplinated, that he lost not one hour of the dayt disciplinated, that he lost not one hour of the dayt disciplinated, that he lost not one hour of the dayt disciplinated, that he lost not one hour of the day.....When Ponocrates knew Gargantua’s vicious manner of liv-ing, he resolved to bring him up in another kind; but for awhile he bore with him, considering that nature cannot en-dure a sudden change, without great violence. Therefore, to"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"88Gargantua & Pantagruelbegin his work the better, he requested a learned physicianof that time, called Master Theodorus, seriously to perpend,if it were possible, how to bring Gargantua into a bettercourse. The said physician purged him canonically withAnticyrian hellebore, by which medicine he cleansed all thealteration and perverse habitude of his brain. By this meansalso Ponocrates made him forget all that he had learned un-der his ancient preceptors, as Timotheus did to his disciples,who had been instructed under other musicians. To do thisthe better, they brought him into the company of learnedmen, which were there, in whose imitation he had a greatdesire and affection to study otherwise, and to improve hisparts. Afterwards he put himself into such a road and way ofstudying, that he lost not any one hour in the day, but em-ployed all his time in learning and honest knowledge.Gargantua awaked, then, about four o’clock in the morning.Whilst they were in rubbing of him, there was read untohim some chapter of the holy Scripture aloud and clearly,with a pronunciation fit for the matter, and hereunto wasappointed a young page born in Basche, named Anagnostes.According to the purpose and argument of that lesson, heoftentimes gave himself to worship, adore, pray, and send uphis supplications to that good God, whose Word did showhis majesty and marvellous judgment. Then went he untothe secret places to make excretion of his natural digestions.There his master repeated what had been read, expoundingunto him the most obscure and difficult points. In return-ing, they considered the face of the sky, if it was such as theyhad observed it the night before, and into what signs the sunwas entering, as also the moon for that day. This done, hewas apparelled, combed, curled, trimmed, and perfumed,during which time they repeated to him the lessons of theday before. He himself said them by heart, and upon themwould ground some practical cases concerning the estate ofman, which he would prosecute sometimes two or threehours, but ordinarily they ceased as soon as he was fullyclothed. Then for three good hours he had a lecture readunto him. This done they went forth, still conferring of thesubstance of the lecture, either unto a field near the univer-sity called the Brack, or unto the meadows, where they playedat the ball, the long-tennis, and at the piletrigone (which is aplay wherein we throw a triangular piece of iron at a ring, to"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"89Rabelaispass it), most gallantly exercising their bodies, as formerlythey had done their minds. All their play was but in liberty,for they left off when they pleased, and that was commonlywhen they did sweat over all their body, or were otherwiseweary. Then were they very well wiped and rubbed, shiftedtheir shirts, and, walking soberly, went to see if dinner wasready. Whilst they stayed for that, they did clearly and elo-quently pronounce some sentences that they had retained ofthe lecture. In the meantime Master Appetite came, and thenvery orderly sat they down at table. At the beginning of themeal there was read some pleasant history of the warlike ac-tions of former times, until he had taken a glass of wine.Then, if they thought good, they continued reading, or be-gan to discourse merrily together; speaking first of the vir-tue, propriety, efficacy, and nature of all that was served in atthe table; of bread, of wine, of water, of salt, of fleshes, fishes,fruits, herbs, roots, and of their dressing. By means whereofhe learned in a little time all the passages competent for thisthat were to be found in Pliny, Athenaeus, Dioscorides, JuliusPollux, Galen, Porphyry, Oppian, Polybius, Heliodore,Aristotle, Aelian, and others. Whilst they talked of thesethings, many times, to be the more certain, they caused thevery books to be brought to the table, and so well and per-fectly did he in his memory retain the things above said, thatin that time there was not a physician that knew half so muchas he did. Afterwards they conferred of the lessons read inthe morning, and, ending their repast with some conserve ormarmalade of quinces, he picked his teeth with mastic tooth-pickers, washed his hands and eyes with fair fresh water, andgave thanks unto God in some fine cantiques, made in praiseof the divine bounty and munificence. This done, theybrought in cards, not to play, but to learn a thousand prettytricks and new inventions, which were all grounded uponarithmetic. By this means he fell in love with that numericalscience, and every day after dinner and supper he passed histime in it as pleasantly as he was wont to do at cards anddice; so that at last he understood so well both the theoryand practical part thereof, that Tunstall the Englishman, whohad written very largely of that purpose, confessed that ver-ily in comparison of him he had no skill at all. And not onlyin that, but in the other mathematical sciences, as geometry,astronomy, music, &c. For in waiting on the concoction and"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"90Gargantua & Pantagruelattending the digestion of his food, they made a thousandpretty instruments and geometrical figures, and did in somemeasure practise the astronomical canons.After this they recreated themselves with singing musically,in four or five parts, or upon a set theme or ground at ran-dom, as it best pleased them. In matter of musical instru-ments, he learned to play upon the lute, the virginals, theharp, the Almain flute with nine holes, the viol, and thesackbut. This hour thus spent, and digestion finished, hedid purge his body of natural excrements, then betook him-self to his principal study for three hours together, or more,as well to repeat his matutinal lectures as to proceed in thebook wherein he was, as also to write handsomely, to drawand form the antique and Roman letters. This being done,they went out of their house, and with them a young gentle-man of Touraine, named the Esquire Gymnast, who taughthim the art of riding. Changing then his clothes, he rode aNaples courser, a Dutch roussin, a Spanish jennet, a bardedor trapped steed, then a light fleet horse, unto whom he gavea hundred carieres, made him go the high saults, boundingin the air, free the ditch with a skip, leap over a stile or pale,turn short in a ring both to the right and left hand. There hebroke not his lance; for it is the greatest foolery in the worldto say, I have broken ten lances at tilts or in fight. A carpen-ter can do even as much. But it is a glorious and praise-worthy action with one lance to break and overthrow tenenemies. Therefore, with a sharp, stiff, strong, and well-steeledlance would he usually force up a door, pierce a harness, beatdown a tree, carry away the ring, lift up a cuirassier saddle,with the mail-coat and gauntlet. All this he did in completearms from head to foot. As for the prancing flourishes andsmacking popisms for the better cherishing of the horse, com-monly used in riding, none did them better than he. Thecavallerize of Ferrara was but as an ape compared to him. Hewas singularly skilful in leaping nimbly from one horse toanother without putting foot to ground, and these horseswere called desultories. He could likewise from either side,with a lance in his hand, leap on horseback without stirrups,and rule the horse at his pleasure without a bridle, for suchthings are useful in military engagements. Another day heexercised the battle-axe, which he so dexterously wielded,both in the nimble, strong, and smooth management of that"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"91Rabelaisweapon, and that in all the feats practicable by it, that hepassed knight of arms in the field, and at all essays.Then tossed he the pike, played with the two-handedsword, with the backsword, with the Spanish tuck, the dag-ger, poniard, armed, unarmed, with a buckler, with a cloak,with a target. Then would he hunt the hart, the roebuck, thebear, the fallow deer, the wild boar, the hare, the pheasant,the partridge, and the bustard. He played at the balloon,and made it bound in the air, both with fist and foot. Hewrestled, ran, jumped—not at three steps and a leap, calledthe hops, nor at clochepied, called the hare’s leap, nor yet atthe Almains; for, said Gymnast, these jumps are for the warsaltogether unprofitable, and of no use—but at one leap hewould skip over a ditch, spring over a hedge, mount six pacesupon a wall, ramp and grapple after this fashion up against awindow of the full height of a lance. He did swim in deepwaters on his belly, on his back, sideways, with all his body,with his feet only, with one hand in the air, wherein he helda book, crossing thus the breadth of the river of Seine with-out wetting it, and dragged along his cloak with his teeth, asdid Julius Caesar; then with the help of one hand he enteredforcibly into a boat, from whence he cast himself again head-long into the water, sounded the depths, hollowed the rocks,and plunged into the pits and gulfs. Then turned he the boatabout, governed it, led it swiftly or slowly with the streamand against the stream, stopped it in his course, guided itwith one hand, and with the other laid hard about him witha huge great oar, hoisted the sail, hied up along the mast bythe shrouds, ran upon the edge of the decks, set the compassin order, tackled the bowlines, and steered the helm. Com-ing out of the water, he ran furiously up against a hill, andwith the same alacrity and swiftness ran down again. Heclimbed up at trees like a cat, and leaped from the one to theother like a squirrel. He did pull down the great boughs andbranches like another Milo; then with two sharp well-steeleddaggers and two tried bodkins would he run up by the wallto the very top of a house like a rat; then suddenly camedown from the top to the bottom, with such an even com-position of members that by the fall he would catch no harm.He did cast the dart, throw the bar, put the stone, practisethe javelin, the boar-spear or partisan, and the halbert. Hebroke the strongest bows in drawing, bended against his breast"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"92Gargantua & Pantagruelthe greatest crossbows of steel, took his aim by the eye withthe hand-gun, and shot well, traversed and planted the can-non, shot at butt-marks, at the papgay from below upwards,or to a height from above downwards, or to a descent; thenbefore him, sideways, and behind him, like the Parthians.They tied a cable-rope to the top of a high tower, by one endwhereof hanging near the ground he wrought himself withhis hands to the very top; then upon the same track camedown so sturdily and firm that you could not on a plainmeadow have run with more assurance. They set up a greatpole fixed upon two trees. There would he hang by his hands,and with them alone, his feet touching at nothing, would goback and fore along the foresaid rope with so great swiftnessthat hardly could one overtake him with running; and then,to exercise his breast and lungs, he would shout like all thedevils in hell. I heard him once call Eudemon from St. Victor’sgate to Montmartre. Stentor had never such a voice at thesiege of Troy. Then for the strengthening of his nerves orsinews they made him two great sows of lead, each of themweighing eight thousand and seven hundred quintals, whichthey called alteres. Those he took up from the ground, ineach hand one, then lifted them up over his head, and heldthem so without stirring three quarters of an hour and more,which was an inimitable force. He fought at barriers withthe stoutest and most vigorous champions; and when it cameto the cope, he stood so sturdily on his feet that he aban-doned himself unto the strongest, in case they could removehim from his place, as Milo was wont to do of old. In whoseimitation, likewise, he held a pomegranate in his hand, togive it unto him that could take it from him. The time beingthus bestowed, and himself rubbed, cleansed, wiped, andrefreshed with other clothes, he returned fair and softly; andpassing through certain meadows, or other grassy places,beheld the trees and plants, comparing them with what iswritten of them in the books of the ancients, such asTheophrast, Dioscorides, Marinus, Pliny, Nicander, Macer,and Galen, and carried home to the house great handfuls ofthem, whereof a young page called Rizotomos had charge;together with little mattocks, pickaxes, grubbing-hooks, cab-bies, pruning-knives, and other instruments requisite forherborizing. Being come to their lodging, whilst supper wasmaking ready, they repeated certain passages of that which"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"93Rabelaishath been read, and sat down to table. Here remark, that hisdinner was sober and thrifty, for he did then eat only to pre-vent the gnawings of his stomach, but his supper was copi-ous and large, for he took then as much as was fit to main-tain and nourish him; which, indeed, is the true diet pre-scribed by the art of good and sound physic, although a rabbleof loggerheaded physicians, nuzzeled in the brabbling shopof sophisters, counsel the contrary. During that repast wascontinued the lesson read at dinner as long as they thoughtgood; the rest was spent in good discourse, learned and prof-itable. After that they had given thanks, he set himself tosing vocally, and play upon harmonious instruments, or oth-erwise passed his time at some pretty sports, made with cardsor dice, or in practising the feats of legerdemain with cupsand balls. There they stayed some nights in frolicking thus,and making themselves merry till it was time to go to bed;and on other nights they would go make visits unto learnedmen, or to such as had been travellers in strange and remotecountries. When it was full night before they retired them-selves, they went unto the most open place of the house tosee the face of the sky, and there beheld the comets, if anywere, as likewise the figures, situations, aspects, oppositions,and conjunctions of both the fixed stars and planets.Then with his master did he briefly recapitulate, after themanner of the Pythagoreans, that which he had read, seen,learned, done, and understood in the whole course of that day.Then prayed they unto God the Creator, in falling downbefore him, and strengthening their faith towards him, andglorifying him for his boundless bounty; and, giving thanksunto him for the time that was past, they recommendedthemselves to his divine clemency for the future.

But after dinner, instead of their wonted exercitations,they did abide within, and, by way of apotherapy (that is, amaking the body healthful by exercise), did recreate them-selves in bottling up of hay, in cleaving and sawing of wood,and in threshing sheaves of corn at the barn. Then they stud-ied the art of painting or carving; or brought into use theantique play of tables, as Leonicus hath written of it, and asour good friend Lascaris playeth at it. In playing they exam-ined the passages of ancient authors wherein the said play ismentioned or any metaphor drawn from it. They went like-wise to see the drawing of metals, or the casting of greatordnance; how the lapidaries did work; as also the goldsmithsand cutters of precious stones. Nor did they omit to visit thealchemists, money-coiners, upholsterers, weavers, velvet-workers, watchmakers, looking-glass framers, printers, or-ganists, and other such kind of artificers, and, everywheregiving them somewhat to drink, did learn and consider theindustry and invention of the trades. They went also to hearthe public lectures, the solemn commencements, the repeti-tions, the acclamations, the pleadings of the gentle lawyers,and sermons of evangelical preachers. He went through thehalls and places appointed for fencing, and there playedagainst the masters themselves at all weapons, and showedthem by experience that he knew as much in it as, yea, morethan, they. And, instead of herborizing, they visited the shopsof druggists, herbalists, and apothecaries, and diligently con-sidered the fruits, roots, leaves, gums, seeds, the grease andointments of some foreign parts, as also how they did adul-terate them. He went to see the jugglers, tumblers, mounte-banks, and quacksalvers, and considered their cunning, theirshifts, their somersaults and smooth tongue, especially ofthose of Chauny in Picardy, who are naturally great praters,and brave givers of fibs, in matter of green apes.At their return they did eat more soberly at supper than atother times, and meats more desiccative and extenuating; tothe end that the intemperate moisture of the air, communi-cated to the body by a necessary confinitive, might by thismeans be corrected, and that they might not receive any preju-dice for want of their ordinary bodily exercise.

Nevertheless Ponocrates,to divert him from this vehement intension of the spirits,thought fit, once in a month, upon some fair and clear day,to go out of the city betimes in the morning, either towardsGentilly, or Boulogne, or to Montrouge, or Charanton bridge,or to Vanves, or St. Clou, and there spend all the day long inmaking the greatest cheer that could be devised, sporting,making merry, drinking healths, playing, singing, dancing,tumbling in some fair meadow, unnestling of sparrows, tak-ing of quails, and fishing for frogs and crabs. But althoughthat day was passed without books or lecture, yet was it notspent without profit; for in the said meadows they usuallyrepeated certain pleasant verses of Virgil’s agriculture, ofHesiod and of Politian’s husbandry, would set a-broach somewitty Latin epigrams, then immediately turned them intoroundelays and songs for dancing in the French language. Intheir feasting they would sometimes separate the water fromthe wine that was therewith mixed, as Cato teacheth, De rerustica, and Pliny with an ivy cup would wash the wine in abasinful of water, then take it out again with a funnel as pureas ever. They made the water go from one glass to another,and contrived a thousand little automatory engines, that isto say, moving of themselves.Chapter 1.XXVChapter 1.XXVChapter 1.XXVChapter 1.XXVChapter 1.XXV.....HHHHHooooow therw therw therw therw there was gre was gre was gre was gre was great strife and debate raised betwixt theeat strife and debate raised betwixt theeat strife and debate raised betwixt theeat strife and debate raised betwixt theeat strife and debate raised betwixt thecake-bakers of Lerne, and those of Gcake-bakers of Lerne, and those of Gcake-bakers of Lerne, and those of Gcake-bakers of Lerne, and those of Gcake-bakers of Lerne, and those of Gargantuaargantuaargantuaargantuaargantua’’’’’s countrs countrs countrs countrs countryyyyy,,,,,wherwherwherwherwhereupon weupon weupon weupon weupon wererererere waged gre waged gre waged gre waged gre waged great wars.eat wars.eat wars.eat wars.eat wars.At that time, which was the season of vintage, in the begin-ning of harvest, when the country shepherds were set to keepthe vines, and hinder the starlings from eating up the grapes,as some cake-bakers of Lerne happened to pass along in thebroad highway, driving into the city ten or twelve horsesloaded with cakes, the said shepherds courteously entreatedthem to give them some for their money, as the price thenruled in the market.

To which provok-ing words, one amongst them, called Forgier, an honest fel-low of his person and a notable springal, made answer verycalmly thus: How long is it since you have got horns, thatyou are become so proud? Indeed formerly you were wontto give us some freely, and will you not now let us have anyfor our money?

Meanwhile the farmers and countryswains, that were watching their walnuts near to that place,came running with their great poles and long staves, andlaid such load on these cake-bakers, as if they had been tothresh upon green rye. The other shepherds and shepherd-esses, hearing the lamentable shout of Forgier, came withtheir slings and slackies following them, and throwing greatstones at them, as thick as if it had been hail. At last theyovertook them, and took from them about four or five dozenof their cakes. Nevertheless they paid for them the ordinaryprice, and gave them over and above one hundred eggs andthree baskets full of mulberries. Then did the cake-bakershelp to get up to his mare Marquet, who was most shrewdlywounded, and forthwith returned to Lerne, changing theresolution they had to go to Pareille, threatening very sharpand boisterously the cowherds, shepherds, and farmers ofSeville and Sinays. This done, the shepherds and shepherd-esses made merry with these cakes and fine grapes, andsported themselves together at the sound of the pretty smallpipe, scoffing and laughing at those vainglorious cake-bak-ers, who had that day met with a mischief for want of cross-ing themselves with a good hand in the morning.

Whence comes this to pass, my masters? Ibeseech you think upon it. The town being thus pillaged,they went unto the abbey with a horrible noise and tumult,but they found it shut and made fast against them. Where-upon the body of the army marched forward towards a passor ford called the Gue de Vede, except seven companies offoot and two hundred lancers, who, staying there, broke downthe walls of the close, to waste, spoil, and make havoc of allthe vines and vintage within that place. The monks (poordevils) knew not in that extremity to which of all their sanctsthey should vow themselves. Nevertheless, at all adventuresthey rang the bells ad capitulum capitulantes. There it wasdecreed that they should make a fair procession, stuffed withgood lectures, prayers, and litanies contra hostium insidias,and jolly responses pro pace.There was then in the abbey a claustral monk, called FriarJohn of the funnels and gobbets, in French des entoumeures,young, gallant, frisk, lusty, nimble, quick, active, bold, ad-venturous, resolute, tall, lean, wide-mouthed, long-nosed, afair despatcher of morning prayers, unbridler of masses, andrunner over of vigils; and, to conclude summarily in a word,a right monk, if ever there was any, since the monking worldmonked a monkery: for the rest, a clerk even to the teeth inmatter of breviary. This monk, hearing the noise that theenemy made within the enclosure of the vineyard, went outto see what they were doing; and perceiving that they werecutting and gathering the grapes, whereon was grounded thefoundation of all their next year’s wine, returned unto thechoir of the church where the other monks were, all amazedand astonished like so many bell-melters.

Wherefore is it, that our devotions were instituted to beshort in the time of harvest and vintage, and long in theadvent, and all the winter? The late friar, Massepelosse, ofgood memory, a true zealous man, or else I give myself to thedevil, of our religion, told me, and I remember it well, howthe reason was, that in this season we might press and makethe wine, and in winter whiff it up. Hark you, my masters,you that love the wine, Cop’s body, follow me; for SanctAnthony burn me as freely as a faggot, if they get leave totaste one drop of the liquor that will not now come and fightfor relief of the vine. Hog’s belly, the goods of the church!Ha, no, no. What the devil, Sanct Thomas of England waswell content to die for them; if I died in the same cause,should not I be a sanct likewise? Yes. Yet shall not I die therefor all this, for it is I that must do it to others and send thema-packing.As he spake this he threw off his great monk’s habit, andlaid hold upon the staff of the cross, which was made of theheart of a sorbapple-tree, it being of the length of a lance,round, of a full grip, and a little powdered with lilies calledflower de luce, the workmanship whereof was almost all de-faced and worn out. Thus went he out in a fair long-skirtedjacket, putting his frock scarfwise athwart his breast, and inthis equipage, with his staff, shaft or truncheon of the cross,laid on so lustily, brisk, and fiercely upon his enemies, who,without any order, or ensign, or trumpet, or drum, werebusied in gathering the grapes of the vineyard.

He hur-ried, therefore, upon them so rudely, without crying gare orbeware, that he overthrew them like hogs, tumbled themover like swine, striking athwart and alongst, and by onemeans or other laid so about him, after the old fashion of"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"102Gargantua & Pantagruelfencing, that to some he beat out their brains, to others hecrushed their arms, battered their legs, and bethwacked theirsides till their ribs cracked with it.

To someothers he spoiled the frame of their kidneys, marred theirbacks, broke their thigh-bones, pashed in their noses, poachedout their eyes, cleft their mandibles, tore their jaws, dung intheir teeth into their throat, shook asunder their omoplatesor shoulder-blades, sphacelated their shins, mortified theirshanks, inflamed their ankles, heaved off of the hinges theirishies, their sciatica or hip-gout, dislocated the joints of theirknees, squattered into pieces the boughts or pestles of theirthighs, and so thumped, mauled and belaboured them ev-erywhere, that never was corn so thick and threefold threshedupon by ploughmen’s flails as were the pitifully disjointedmembers of their mangled bodies under the merciless batonof the cross. If any offered to hide himself amongst the thick-est of the vines, he laid him squat as a flounder, bruised theridge of his back, and dashed his reins like a dog. If anythought by flight to escape, he made his head to fly in piecesby the lamboidal commissure, which is a seam in the hinderpart of the skull. If anyone did scramble up into a tree, think-ing there to be safe, he rent up his perinee, and impaled himin at the fundament. If any of his old acquaintance hap-pened to cry out, Ha, Friar John, my friend Friar John, quar-ter, quarter, I yield myself to you, to you I render myself! Sothou shalt, said he, and must, whether thou wouldst or no,and withal render and yield up thy soul to all the devils inhell; then suddenly gave them dronos, that is, so manyknocks, thumps, raps, dints, thwacks, and bangs, as sufficedto warn Pluto of their coming and despatch them a-going.

Others cried, OurLady of Cunaut, of Loretto, of Good Tidings, on the otherside of the water St. Mary Over. Some vowed a pilgrimage toSt. James, and others to the holy handkerchief at Chamberry,which three months after that burnt so well in the fire thatthey could not get one thread of it saved. Others sent uptheir vows to St. Cadouin, others to St. John d’Angely, andto St. Eutropius of Xaintes. Others again invoked St. Mesmesof Chinon, St. Martin of Candes, St. Clouaud of Sinays, theholy relics of Laurezay, with a thousand other jolly little sanctsand santrels. Some died without speaking, others spoke with-out dying; some died in speaking, others spoke in dying.Others shouted as loud as they could Confession, Confes-sion, Confiteor, Miserere, In manus! So great was the cry ofthe wounded, that the prior of the abbey with all his monkscame forth, who, when they saw these poor wretches so slainamongst the vines, and wounded to death, confessed someof them. But whilst the priests were busied in confessingthem, the little monkies ran all to the place where Friar Johnwas, and asked him wherein he would be pleased to requiretheir assistance. To which he answered that they should cutthe throats of those he had thrown down upon the ground.They presently, leaving their outer habits and cowls uponthe rails, began to throttle and make an end of those whomhe had already crushed.

Thus by his prowess and valour were discom-fited all those of the army that entered into the close of theabbey, unto the number of thirteen thousand, six hundred,twenty and two, besides the women and little children, whichis always to be understood.

When the good mancame back, he asked him, Ha, my friend, what news do youbring me? There is neither hope nor remedy, said Gallet; theman is quite out of his wits, and forsaken of God. Yea, but,said Grangousier, my friend, what cause doth he pretend forhis outrages? He did not show me any cause at all, said Gallet,only that in a great anger he spoke some words of cakes. Icannot tell if they have done any wrong to his cake-bakers. Iwill know, said Grangousier, the matter thoroughly, before Iresolve any more upon what is to be done. Then sent he tolearn concerning that business, and found by true informa-tion that his men had taken violently some cakes fromPicrochole’s people, and that Marquet’s head was broken witha slacky or short cudgel; that, nevertheless, all was well paid,and that the said Marquet had first hurt Forgier with a strokeof his whip athwart the legs.

Picrochole would not so muchas let them in, nor go to speak with them, but sent themword that he was busy, and that they should deliver theirmind to Captain Touquedillon, who was then planting a pieceof ordnance upon the wall. Then said the good man untohim, My lord, to ease you of all this labour, and to take awayall excuses why you may not return unto our former alli-ance, we do here presently restore unto you the cakes uponwhich the quarrel arose. Five dozen did our people take away:they were well paid for: we love peace so well that we restoreunto you five cartloads, of which this cart shall be forMarquet, who doth most complain.

Then with a somer-sault springing into the air again, he fell to stand with bothhis feet close together upon the saddle, and there made abovea hundred frisks, turns, and demipommads, with his armsheld out across, and in so doing cried out aloud, I rage, Irage, devils, I am stark mad, devils, I am mad, hold me, dev-ils, hold me, hold, devils, hold, hold!Whilst he was thus vaulting, the rogues in great astonish-ment said to one another, By cock’s death, he is a goblin or adevil thus disguised.

Then Gargantuamounted his great mare, accompanied as we have said be-fore, and finding in his way a high and great tree, whichcommonly was called by the name of St. Martin’s tree, be-cause heretofore St. Martin planted a pilgrim’s staff there,which in tract of time grew to that height and greatness,said, This is that which I lacked; this tree shall serve me bothfor a staff and lance. With that he pulled it up easily, pluckedoff the boughs, and trimmed it at his pleasure. In the mean-time his mare pissed to ease her belly, but it was in suchabundance that it did overflow the country seven leagues,and all the piss of that urinal flood ran glib away towards theford of Vede, wherewith the water was so swollen that all theforces the enemy had there were with great horror drowned,except some who had taken the way on the left hand to-wards the hills. Gargantua, being come to the place of thewood of Vede, was informed by Eudemon that there wassome remainder of the enemy within the castle, which toknow, Gargantua cried out as loud as he was able, Are youthere, or are you not there? If you be there, be there no more;and if you are not there, I have no more to say.

Going from thence, they came tothe bridge at the mill, where they found all the ford coveredwith dead bodies, so thick that they had choked up the milland stopped the current of its water, and these were thosethat were destroyed in the urinal deluge of the mare. Therethey were at a stand, consulting how they might pass with-out hindrance by these dead carcasses. But Gymnast said, Ifthe devils have passed there, I will pass well enough.

Gargantua finding himself some-what dry, asked whether they could get any lettuce to makehim a salad; and hearing that there were the greatest andfairest in the country, for they were as great as plum-trees oras walnut-trees, he would go thither himself, and broughtthence in his hand what he thought good, and withal carriedaway the six pilgrims, who were in so great fear that they didnot dare to speak nor cough.Washing them, therefore, first at the fountain, the pilgrimssaid one to another softly, What shall we do? We are almostdrowned here amongst these lettuce, shall we speak? But ifwe speak, he will kill us for spies. And, as they were thusdeliberating what to do, Gargantua put them with the let-tuce into a platter of the house, as large as the huge tun ofthe White Friars of the Cistercian order; which done, withoil, vinegar, and salt, he ate them up, to refresh himself alittle before supper, and had already swallowed up five of thepilgrims, the sixth being in the platter, totally hid under alettuce, except his bourdon or staff that appeared, and noth-ing else. Which Grangousier seeing, said to Gargantua, I thinkthat is the horn of a shell-snail, do not eat it. Why not? saidGargantua, they are good all this month: which he no soonersaid, but, drawing up the staff, and therewith taking up thepilgrim, he ate him very well, then drank a terrible draughtof excellent white wine. The pilgrims, thus devoured, madeshift to save themselves as well as they could, by withdraw-ing their bodies out of the reach of the grinders of his teeth,but could not escape from thinking they had been put in thelowest dungeon of a prison. And when Gargantua whiffedthe great draught, they thought to have been drowned in hismouth, and the flood of wine had almost carried them awayinto the gulf of his stomach. Nevertheless, skipping with theirbourdons, as St. Michael’s palmers use to do, they shelteredthemselves from the danger of that inundation under the"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"126Gargantua & Pantagruelbanks of his teeth.

To ease himself therefore of his smart-ing ache, he called for his toothpicker, and rubbing towardsa young walnut-tree, where they lay skulking, unnestled youmy gentlemen pilgrims.For he caught one by the legs, another by the scrip, an-other by the pocket, another by the scarf, another by theband of the breeches, and the poor fellow that had hurt himwith the bourdon, him he hooked to him by the codpiece,which snatch nevertheless did him a great deal of good, for itpierced unto him a pocky botch he had in the groin, whichgrievously tormented him ever since they were past Ancenis.The pilgrims, thus dislodged, ran away athwart the plain apretty fast pace, and the pain ceased, even just at the timewhen by Eudemon he was called to supper, for all was ready.I will go then, said he, and piss away my misfortune; whichhe did do in such a copious measure, that the urine takingaway the feet from the pilgrims, they were carried along withthe stream unto the bank of a tuft of trees. Upon which, assoon as they had taken footing, and that for their self-preser-vation they had run a little out of the road, they on a suddenfell all six, except Fourniller, into a trap that had been madeto take wolves by a train, out of which, nevertheless, theyescaped by the industry of the said Fourniller, who broke allthe snares and ropes.

Then Gargantua desired that he might be pres-ently sent for, to the end that with him they might consultof what was to be done. Whereupon, by a joint consent, hissteward went for him, and brought him along merrily, withhis staff of the cross, upon Grangousier’s mule.

In that, said Gymnast, he dothnot resemble the foxes; for of the capons, hens, and pulletswhich they carry away they never eat the white. Why? saidthe monk. Because, said Gymnast, they have no cooks todress them; and, if they be not competently made ready, theyremain red and not white; the redness of meats being a to-ken that they have not got enough of the fire, whether byboiling, roasting, or otherwise, except the shrimps, lobsters,crabs, and crayfishes, which are cardinalized with boiling.By God’s feast-gazers, said the monk, the porter of our ab-bey then hath not his head well boiled, for his eyes are as redas a mazer made of an alder-tree. The thigh of this leveret isgood for those that have the gout. To the purpose of thetruel,—what is the reason that the thighs of a gentlewomanare always fresh and cool? This problem, said Gargantua, isneither in Aristotle, in Alexander Aphrodiseus, nor inPlutarch. There are three causes, said the monk, by whichthat place is naturally refreshed. Primo, because the waterruns all along by it. Secundo, because it is a shady place,obscure and dark, upon which the sun never shines.

How is it, then, that they exclude the monks from allgood companies, calling them feast-troublers, marrers ofmirth, and disturbers of all civil conversation, as the beesdrive away the drones from their hives? Ignavum fucos pecus,said Maro, a praesepibus arcent. Hereunto, answeredGargantua, there is nothing so true as that the frock andcowl draw unto itself the opprobries, injuries, and maledic-tions of the world, just as the wind called Cecias attracts theclouds. The peremptory reason is, because they eat the or-dure and excrements of the world, that is to say, the sins ofthe people, and, like dung-chewers and excrementitious eat-ers, they are cast into the privies and secessive places, that is,the convents and abbeys, separated from political conversa-tion, as the jakes and retreats of a house are. But if you con-ceive how an ape in a family is always mocked and provok-ingly incensed, you shall easily apprehend how monks areshunned of all men, both young and old. The ape keeps notthe house as a dog doth, he draws not in the plough as theox, he yields neither milk nor wool as the sheep, he carriethno burden as a horse doth. That which he doth, is only toconskite, spoil, and defile all, which is the cause whereforehe hath of all men mocks, frumperies, and bastinadoes.After the same manner a monk—I mean those lither, idle,lazy monks—doth not labour and work, as do the peasantand artificier; doth not ward and defend the country, as doththe man of war; cureth not the sick and diseased, as the phy-sician doth; doth neither preach nor teach, as do the evan-gelical doctors and schoolmasters; doth not import commodi-ties and things necessary for the commonwealth, as the mer-chant doth. Therefore is it that by and of all men they arehooted at, hated, and abhorred. Yea, but, said Grangousier,they pray to God for us.

No, said the monk, of that I takeno care. How much would you have for having taken him?Nothing, nothing, said the monk; I am not swayed by that,nor do I regard it. Then Grangousier commanded that, inpresence of Touchfaucet, should be delivered to the monk fortaking him the sum of three score and two thousand saluts (inEnglish money, fifteen thousand and five hundred pounds),which was done, whilst they made a collation or little banquetto the said Touchfaucet, of whom Grangousier asked if hewould stay with him, or if he loved rather to return to hisking. Touchfaucet answered that he was content to take what-ever course he would advise him to. Then, said Grangousier,return unto your king, and God be with you.Then he gave him an excellent sword of a Vienne blade,with a golden scabbard wrought with vine-branch-like flour-ishes, of fair goldsmith’s work, and a collar or neck-chain ofgold, weighing seven hundred and two thousand marks (at"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"145Rabelaiseight ounces each), garnished with precious stones of thefinest sort, esteemed at a hundred and sixty thousand duc-ats, and ten thousand crowns more, as an honourable dona-tive, by way of present.After this talk Touchfaucet got to his horse, and Gargantuafor his safety allowed him the guard of thirty men-at-armsand six score archers to attend him, under the conduct ofGymnast, to bring him even unto the gate of the rockClermond, if there were need. As soon as he was gone, themonk restored unto Grangousier the three score and twothousand saluts which he had received, saying, Sir, it is notas yet the time for you to give such gifts; stay till this war beat an end, for none can tell what accidents may occur, andwar begun without good provision of money beforehand forgoing through with it, is but as a breathing of strength, andblast that will quickly pass away.

Having thus set forward, as soon asthey had gained the pass at the ford of Vede, with boats andbridges speedily made they passed over in a trice. Then con-sidering the situation of the town, which was on a high andadvantageous place, Gargantua thought fit to call his coun-cil, and pass that night in deliberation upon what was to bedone. But Gymnast said unto him, My sovereign lord, suchis the nature and complexion of the French, that they areworth nothing but at the first push. Then are they morefierce than devils. But if they linger a little and be weariedwith delays, they’ll prove more faint and remiss than women.My opinion is, therefore, that now presently, after your menhave taken breath and some small refection, you give orderfor a resolute assault, and that we storm them instantly. Hisadvice was found very good, and for effectuating thereof hebrought forth his army into the plain field, and placed thereserves on the skirt or rising of a little hill. The monk tookalong with him six companies of foot and two hundred horse-men well armed, and with great diligence crossed the marsh,and valiantly got upon the top of the green hillock even untothe highway which leads to Loudun. Whilst the assault wasthus begun, Picrochole’s men could not tell well what wasbest, to issue out and receive the assailants, or keep within thetown and not to stir. Himself in the mean time, without de-liberation, sallied forth in a rage with the cavalry of his guard,who were forthwith received and royally entertained with greatcannon-shot that fell upon them like hail from the highgrounds on which the artillery was planted.

Which Gargantua perceiving, he wentwith a strong party to their relief, and with his artillery be-gan to thunder so terribly upon that canton of the wall, andso long, that all the strength within the town, to maintainand fill up the breach, was drawn thither.

Then opening that east gate,he issued out to succour and assist Gargantua.

All this hemisphere of the world was filledwith the praises and congratulations which yourselves andyour fathers made, when Alpharbal, King of Canarre, notsatisfied with his own fortunes, did most furiously invadethe land of Onyx, and with cruel piracies molest all theArmoric Islands and confine regions of Britany. Yet was hein a set naval fight justly taken and vanquished by my father,whom God preserve and protect. But what? Whereas otherkings and emperors, yea, those who entitle themselves Catho-lics, would have dealt roughly with him, kept him a closeprisoner, and put him to an extreme high ransom, he en-treated him very courteously, lodged him kindly with him-self in his own palace, and out of his incredible mildness andgentle disposition sent him back with a safe conduct, ladenwith gifts, laden with favours, laden with all offices of friend-ship. What fell out upon it? Being returned into his country,he called a parliament, where all the princes and states of hiskingdom being assembled, he showed them the humanitywhich he had found in us, and therefore wished them totake such course by way of compensation therein as that thewhole world might be edified by the example, as well of theirhonest graciousness to us as of our gracious honesty towardsthem.

In end, this free good-will and simple meaning of the Canarians wrought such ten-derness in my father’s heart that he could not abstain fromshedding tears, and wept most profusely; then, by choicewords very congruously adapted, strove in what he could todiminish the estimation of the good offices which he haddone them, saying, that any courtesy he had conferred uponthem was not worth a rush, and what favour soever he hadshowed them he was bound to do it.

They always carried a fair panache, or plumeof feathers, of the colour of their muff, bravely adorned andtricked out with glistering spangles of gold. In the wintertime they had their taffety gowns of all colours, as above-named, and those lined with the rich furrings of hind-wolves,or speckled lynxes, black-spotted weasels, martlet skins ofCalabria, sables, and other costly furs of an inestimable value.Their beads, rings, bracelets, collars, carcanets, and neck-chains were all of precious stones, such as carbuncles, rubies,baleus, diamonds, sapphires, emeralds, turquoises, garnets,agates, beryls, and excellent margarites. Their head-dressingalso varied with the season of the year, according to whichthey decked themselves.

The dagger was of the same. Their caps or bonnetswere of black velvet, adorned with jewels and buttons of gold.Upon that they wore a white plume, most prettily and min-ion-like parted by so many rows of gold spangles, at the endwhereof hung dangling in a more sparkling resplendency fairrubies, emeralds, diamonds, &c., but there was such a sym-pathy betwixt the gallants and the ladies, that every day theywere apparelled in the same livery. And that they might notmiss, there were certain gentlemen appointed to tell theyouths every morning what vestments the ladies would onthat day wear: for all was done according to the pleasure ofthe ladies. In these so handsome clothes, and habiliments sorich, think not that either one or other of either sex did wasteany time at all; for the masters of the wardrobes had all theirraiments and apparel so ready for every morning, and thechamber-ladies so well skilled, that in a trice they would bedressed and completely in their clothes from head to foot.And to have those accoutrements with the more conveniency,there was about the wood of Theleme a row of houses of theextent of half a league, very neat and cleanly, wherein dweltthe goldsmiths, lapidaries, jewellers, embroiderers, tailors,gold-drawers, velvet-weavers, tapestry-makers and upholster-ers, who wrought there every one in his own trade, and allfor the aforesaid jolly friars and nuns of the new stamp.

None did awake them, none did offer to constrainthem to eat, drink, nor to do any other thing; for so hadGargantua established it. In all their rule and strictest tie oftheir order there was but this one clause to be observed,Do What Thou Wilt;because men that are free, well-born, well-bred, and conver-sant in honest companies, have naturally an instinct and spurthat prompteth them unto virtuous actions, and withdrawsthem from vice, which is called honour. Those same men,when by base subjection and constraint they are broughtunder and kept down, turn aside from that noble disposi-tion by which they formerly were inclined to virtue, to shakeoff and break that bond of servitude wherein they are sotyrannously enslaved; for it is agreeable with the nature ofman to long after things forbidden and to desire what is de-nied us.By this liberty they entered into a very laudable emulationto do all of them what they saw did please one. If any of thegallants or ladies should say, Let us drink, they would alldrink. If any one of them said, Let us play, they all played. Ifone said, Let us go a-walking into the fields they went all.

So noblywere they taught, that there was neither he nor she amongstthem but could read, write, sing, play upon several musicalinstruments, speak five or six several languages, and com-pose in them all very quaintly, both in verse and prose.

For this reason, when the time came that anyman of the said abbey, either at the request of his parents, orfor some other cause, had a mind to go out of it, he carriedalong with him one of the ladies, namely, her whom he hadbefore that chosen for his mistress, and (they) were marriedtogether.

In it the kalendswere found by the Grecian almanacks. There was that yearnothing of the month of March in the time of Lent, and themiddle of August was in May. In the month of October, as Itake it, or at least September, that I may not err, for I willcarefully take heed of that, was the week so famous in theannals, which they call the week of the three Thursdays; forit had three of them by means of their irregular leap-years,called Bissextiles, occasioned by the sun’s having tripped andstumbled a little towards the left hand, like a debtor afraid ofsergeants, coming right upon him to arrest him: and the moonvaried from her course above five fathom, and there wasmanifestly seen the motion of trepidation in the firmamentof the fixed stars, called Aplanes, so that the middle Pleiade,leaving her fellows, declined towards the equinoctial, andthe star named Spica left the constellation of the Virgin towithdraw herself towards the Balance, known by the nameof Libra, which are cases very terrible, and matters so hardand difficult that astrologians cannot set their teeth in them;and indeed their teeth had been pretty long if they couldhave reached thither.However, account you it for a truth that everybody then"},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"177Rabelaisdid most heartily eat of these medlars, for they were fair tothe eye and in taste delicious.

And of thisrace came St. Fatgulch and Shrove Tuesday (Pansart,Mardigras.). Others did swell at the shoulders, who in thatplace were so crump and knobby that they were thereforecalled Montifers, which is as much to say as Hill-carriers, ofwhom you see some yet in the world, of divers sexes anddegrees. Of this race came Aesop, some of whose excellentwords and deeds you have in writing.

You know therest of the song. Others did grow in matter of ballocks soenormously that three of them would well fill a sack able tocontain five quarters of wheat. From them are descended theballocks of Lorraine, which never dwell in codpieces, but falldown to the bottom of the breeches.

But thatwe may fully understand the cause and reason of the nameof Pantagruel which at his baptism was given him, you are toremark that in that year there was so great drought over allthe country of Africa that there passed thirty and six months,three weeks, four days, thirteen hours and a little more with-out rain, but with a heat so vehement that the whole earthwas parched and withered by it. Neither was it more scorchedand dried up with heat in the days of Elijah than it was atthat time; for there was not a tree to be seen that had eitherleaf or bloom upon it. The grass was without verdure or green-ness, the rivers were drained, the fountains dried up, the poorfishes, abandoned and forsaken by their proper element,wandering and crying upon the ground most horribly. Thebirds did fall down from the air for want of moisture anddew wherewith to refresh them. The wolves, foxes, harts,wild boars, fallow deer, hares, coneys, weasels, brocks, bad-gers, and other such beasts, were found dead in the fieldswith their mouths open.

O how happy was he in thatyear who had a cool cellar under ground, well plenished withfresh wine!The philosopher reports, in moving the question, Where-fore it is that the sea-water is salt, that at the time whenPhoebus gave the government of his resplendent chariot tohis son Phaeton, the said Phaeton, unskilful in the art, andnot knowing how to keep the ecliptic line betwixt the twotropics of the latitude of the sun’s course, strayed out of hisway, and came so near the earth that he dried up all thecountries that were under it, burning a great part of the heav-ens which the philosophers call Via lactea, and the huffsnuffsSt. James’s way; although the most coped, lofty, and high-crested poets affirm that to be the place where Juno’s milkfell when she gave suck to Hercules. The earth at that timewas so excessively heated that it fell into an enormous sweat,yea, such a one as made it sweat out the sea, which is there-fore salt, because all sweat is salt; and this you cannot butconfess to be true if you will taste of your own, or of thosethat have the pox, when they are put into sweating, it is allone to me.Just such another case fell out this same year: for on a cer-tain Friday, when the whole people were bent upon theirdevotions, and had made goodly processions, with store oflitanies, and fair preachings, and beseechings of God Al-mighty to look down with his eye of mercy upon their mis-erable and disconsolate condition, there was even then vis-ibly seen issue out of the ground great drops of water, suchas fall from a puff-bagged man in a top sweat, and the poorhoidens began to rejoice as if it had been a thing very profit-able unto them; for some said that there was not one drop ofmoisture in the air whence they might have any rain, andthat the earth did supply the default of that. Other learnedmen said that it was a shower of the antipodes, as Senecasaith in his fourth book Quaestionum naturalium, speakingof the source and spring of Nilus.

At the sight hereof the said midwives were muchamazed, yet some of them said, Lo, here is good provision,and indeed we need it; for we drink but lazily, as if our tongueswalked on crutches, and not lustily like Lansman Dutches.Truly this is a good sign; there is nothing here but what is fitfor us; these are the spurs of wine, that set it a-going.

Yet haveyou never heard of any so wonderful as that of Pantagruel;for it is a very difficult matter to believe, how in the littletime he was in his mother’s belly he grew both in body andstrength. That which Hercules did was nothing, when in hiscradle he slew two serpents, for those serpents were but littleand weak, but Pantagruel, being yet in the cradle, did farmore admirable things, and more to be amazed at. I pass byhere the relation of how at every one of his meals he suppedup the milk of four thousand and six hundred cows, andhow, to make him a skillet to boil his milk in, there were seta-work all the braziers of Somure in Anjou, of Villedieu inNormandy, and of Bramont in Lorraine. And they served inthis whitepot-meat to him in a huge great bell, which is yetto be seen in the city of Bourges in Berry, near the palace,but his teeth were already so well grown, and so strength-ened with vigour, that of the said bell he bit off a great mor-sel, as very plainly doth appear till this hour.One day in the morning, when they would have madehim suck one of his cows—for he never had any other nurse,as the history tells us—he got one of his arms loose from theswaddling bands wherewith he was kept fast in the cradle,laid hold on the said cow under the left foreham, and grasp-ing her to him ate up her udder and half of her paunch, withthe liver and the kidneys, and had devoured all up if she hadnot cried out most horribly, as if the wolves had held her bythe legs, at which noise company came in and took away thesaid cow from Pantagruel. Yet could they not so well do itbut that the quarter whereby he caught her was left in hishand, of which quarter he gulped up the flesh in a trice, evenwith as much ease as you would eat a sausage, and that sogreedily with desire of more, that, when they would havetaken away the bone from him, he swallowed it down whole,as a cormorant would do a little fish; and afterwards beganfumblingly to say, Good, good, good—for he could not yet"},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"187Rabelaisspeak plain—giving them to understand thereby that he hadfound it very good, and that he did lack but so much more.Which when they saw that attended him, they bound himwith great cable-ropes, like those that are made at Tain forthe carriage of salt to Lyons, or such as those are whereby thegreat French ship rides at anchor in the road of Newhaven inNormandy. But, on a certain time, a great bear, which hisfather had bred, got loose, came towards him, began to lickhis face, for his nurses had not thoroughly wiped his chaps,at which unexpected approach being on a sudden offended,he as lightly rid himself of those great cables as Samson didof the hawser ropes wherewith the Philistines had tied him,and, by your leave, takes me up my lord the bear, and tearshim to you in pieces like a pullet, which served him for agorgeful or good warm bit for that meal.Whereupon Gargantua, fearing lest the child should hurthimself, caused four great chains of iron to be made to bindhim, and so many strong wooden arches unto his cradle,most firmly stocked and morticed in huge frames. Of thosechains you have one at Rochelle, which they draw up at nightbetwixt the two great towers of the haven. Another is atLyons,—a third at Angiers,—and the fourth was carried awayby the devils to bind Lucifer, who broke his chains in thosedays by reason of a colic that did extraordinarily tormenthim, taken with eating a sergeant’s soul fried for his break-fast. And therefore you may believe that which Nicholas deLyra saith upon that place of the Psalter where it is written,Et Og Regem Basan, that the said Og, being yet little, was sostrong and robustious, that they were fain to bind him withchains of iron in his cradle. Thus continued Pantagruel for awhile very calm and quiet, for he was not able so easily tobreak those chains, especially having no room in the cradleto give a swing with his arms. But see what happened onceupon a great holiday that his father Gargantua made a sump-tuous banquet to all the princes of his court. I am apt tobelieve that the menial officers of the house were so embusiedin waiting each on his proper service at the feast, that no-body took care of poor Pantagruel, who was left a reculorum,behindhand, all alone, and as forsaken. What did he? Harkwhat he did, good people. He strove and essayed to breakthe chains of the cradle with his arms, but could not, forthey were too strong for him. Then did he keep with his feet"},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"188Gargantua & Pantagruelsuch a stamping stir, and so long, that at last he beat out thelower end of his cradle, which notwithstanding was made ofa great post five foot in square; and as soon as he had gottenout his feet, he slid down as well as he could till he had gothis soles to the ground, and then with a mighty force he roseup, carrying his cradle upon his back, bound to him like atortoise that crawls up against a wall; and to have seen him,you would have thought it had been a great carrick of fivehundred tons upon one end. In this manner he entered intothe great hall where they were banqueting, and that veryboldly, which did much affright the company; yet, becausehis arms were tied in, he could not reach anything to eat, butwith great pain stooped now and then a little to take withthe whole flat of his tongue some lick, good bit, or morsel.Which when his father saw, he knew well enough that theyhad left him without giving him anything to eat, and there-fore commanded that he should be loosed from the saidchains, by the counsel of the princes and lords there present.Besides that also the physicians of Gargantua said that, ifthey did thus keep him in the cradle, he would be all hislifetime subject to the stone. When he was unchained, theymade him to sit down, where, after he had fed very well, hetook his cradle and broke it into more than five hundred thou-sand pieces with one blow of his fist that he struck in themidst of it, swearing that he would never come into it again.Chapter 2.VChapter 2.VChapter 2.VChapter 2.VChapter 2.V.....OOOOOf the acts of the noble Pf the acts of the noble Pf the acts of the noble Pf the acts of the noble Pf the acts of the noble Pantagrantagrantagrantagrantagruel in his yuel in his yuel in his yuel in his yuel in his youthful age.outhful age.outhful age.outhful age.outhful age.Thus grew Pantagruel from day to day, and to everyone’s eyewaxed more and more in all his dimensions, which made hisfather to rejoice by a natural affection. Therefore caused heto be made for him, whilst he was yet little, a pretty cross-bow wherewith to shoot at small birds, which now they callthe get crossbow at Chantelle. Then he sent him to the schoolto learn, and to spend his youth in virtue. In the prosecutionof which design he came first to Poictiers, where, as he stud-ied and profited very much, he saw that the scholars wereoftentimes at leisure and knew not how to bestow their time,which moved him to take such compassion on them, thatone day he took from a long ledge of rocks, called there"},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"189RabelaisPasselourdin, a huge great stone, of about twelve fathomsquare and fourteen handfuls thick, and with great ease set itupon four pillars in the midst of a field, to no other end butthat the said scholars, when they had nothing else to do,might pass their time in getting up on that stone, and feast itwith store of gammons, pasties, and flagons, and carve theirnames upon it with a knife, in token of which deed till thishour the stone is called the lifted stone. And in remembrancehereof there is none entered into the register and matricularbook of the said university, or accounted capable of takingany degree therein, till he have first drunk in the caballinefountain of Croustelles, passed at Passelourdin, and got upupon the lifted stone.Afterwards, reading the delectable chronicles of his ances-tors, he found that Geoffrey of Lusignan, called Geoffreywith the great tooth, grandfather to the cousin-in-law of theeldest sister of the aunt of the son-in-law of the uncle of thegood daughter of his stepmother, was interred at Maillezais;therefore one day he took campos (which is a little vacationfrom study to play a while), that he might give him a visit asunto an honest man. And going from Poictiers with some ofhis companions, they passed by the Guge (Leguge), visitingthe noble Abbot Ardillon; then by Lusignan, by Sansay, byCelles, by Coolonges, by Fontenay-le-Comte, saluting thelearned Tiraqueau, and from thence arrived at Maillezais,where he went to see the sepulchre of the said Geoffrey withthe great tooth; which made him somewhat afraid, lookingupon the picture, whose lively draughts did set him forth inthe representation of a man in an extreme fury, drawing hisgreat Malchus falchion half way out of his scabbard. Whenthe reason hereof was demanded, the canons of the said placetold him that there was no other cause of it but that Pictoribusatque Poetis, &c., that is to say, that painters and poets haveliberty to paint and devise what they list after their own fancy.But he was not satisfied with their answer, and said, He isnot thus painted without a cause, and I suspect that at hisdeath there was some wrong done him, whereof he requirethhis kindred to take revenge. I will inquire further into it, andthen do what shall be reasonable. Then he returned not toPoictiers, but would take a view of the other universities ofFrance.

Therefore he resolved he would study the laws; but see-ing that there were but three scald- and one bald-pated legistin that place, he departed from thence, and in his way madethe bridge of Guard and the amphitheatre of Nimes in lessthan three hours, which, nevertheless, seems to be a moredivine than human work. After that he came to Avignon,where he was not above three days before he fell in love; forthe women there take great delight in playing at the close-buttock game, because it is papal ground. Which his tutorand pedagogue Epistemon perceiving, he drew him out of thatplace, and brought him to Valence in the Dauphiny, where hesaw no great matter of recreation, only that the lubbers of thetown did beat the scholars, which so incensed him with anger,that when, upon a certain very fair Sunday, the people beingat their public dancing in the streets, and one of the scholarsoffering to put himself into the ring to partake of that sport,the foresaid lubberly fellows would not permit him the admit-tance into their society, he, taking the scholar’s part, sobelaboured them with blows, and laid such load upon them,that he drove them all before him, even to the brink of theriver Rhone, and would have there drowned them, but thatthey did squat to the ground, and there lay close a full half-league under the river. The hole is to be seen there yet.After that he departed from thence, and in three stridesand one leap came to Angiers, where he found himself verywell, and would have continued there some space, but thatthe plague drove them away.

Whereby that in some measure is restored unto uswhich was taken from us by the sin of our first parents, towhom it was said that, because they had not obeyed the com-mandment of God their Creator, they should die, and by deathshould be brought to nought that so stately frame andplasmature wherein the man at first had been created.But by this means of seminal propagation there (“Whichcontinueth” in the old copy.) continueth in the children whatwas lost in the parents, and in the grandchildren that whichperished in their fathers, and so successively until the day ofthe last judgment, when Jesus Christ shall have rendered upto God the Father his kingdom in a peaceable condition, outof all danger and contamination of sin; for then shall ceaseall generations and corruptions, and the elements leave offtheir continual transmutations, seeing the so much desiredpeace shall be attained unto and enjoyed, and that all thingsshall be brought to their end and period. And, therefore, notwithout just and reasonable cause do I give thanks to Godmy Saviour and Preserver, for that he hath enabled me to seemy bald old age reflourish in thy youth; for when, at hisgood pleasure, who rules and governs all things, my soulshall leave this mortal habitation, I shall not account myselfwholly to die, but to pass from one place unto another, con-sidering that, in and by that, I continue in my visible image"},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"201Rabelaisliving in the world, visiting and conversing with people ofhonour, and other my good friends, as I was wont to do.Which conversation of mine, although it was not withoutsin, because we are all of us trespassers, and therefore oughtcontinually to beseech his divine majesty to blot our trans-gressions out of his memory, yet was it, by the help and graceof God, without all manner of reproach before men.Wherefore, if those qualities of the mind but shine in theewherewith I am endowed, as in thee remaineth the perfectimage of my body, thou wilt be esteemed by all men to bethe perfect guardian and treasure of the immortality of ourname. But, if otherwise, I shall truly take but small pleasureto see it, considering that the lesser part of me, which is thebody, would abide in thee, and the best, to wit, that which isthe soul, and by which our name continues blessed amongstmen, would be degenerate and abastardized. This I do notspeak out of any distrust that I have of thy virtue, which Ihave heretofore already tried, but to encourage thee yet moreearnestly to proceed from good to better.

Printing likewise is now inuse, so elegant and so correct that better cannot be imag-ined, although it was found out but in my time by divineinspiration, as by a diabolical suggestion on the other sidewas the invention of ordnance. All the world is full of know-ing men, of most learned schoolmasters, and vast libraries;and it appears to me as a truth, that neither in Plato’s time,nor Cicero’s, nor Papinian’s, there was ever such conveniencyfor studying as we see at this day there is.

Let there be no history which thoushalt not have ready in thy memory; unto the prosecuting ofwhich design, books of cosmography will be very conducibleand help thee much. Of the liberal arts of geometry, arith-metic, and music, I gave thee some taste when thou wert yetlittle, and not above five or six years old. Proceed further inthem, and learn the remainder if thou canst. As for astronomy,study all the rules thereof. Let pass, nevertheless, the divin-ing and judicial astrology, and the art of Lullius, as beingnothing else but plain abuses and vanities. As for the civillaw, of that I would have thee to know the texts by heart,and then to confer them with philosophy.Now, in matter of the knowledge of the works of nature, Iwould have thee to study that exactly, and that so there beno sea, river, nor fountain, of which thou dost not know thefishes; all the fowls of the air; all the several kinds of shrubsand trees, whether in forests or orchards; all the sorts of herbsand flowers that grow upon the ground; all the various met-als that are hid within the bowels of the earth; together withall the diversity of precious stones that are to be seen in theorient and south parts of the world.

By my faith, he is onlypoor in fortune; for I may assure you that by his physiog-nomy it appeareth that nature hath extracted him from somerich and noble race, and that too much curiosity hath thrownhim upon adventures which possibly have reduced him tothis indigence, want, and penury. Now as he was just amongstthem, Pantagruel said unto him, Let me entreat you, friend,that you may be pleased to stop here a little and answer meto that which I shall ask you, and I am confident you willnot think your time ill bestowed; for I have an extreme de-sire, according to my ability, to give you some supply in thisdistress wherein I see you are; because I do very much com-miserate your case, which truly moves me to great pity. There-fore, my friend, tell me who you are; whence you come;whither you go; what by desire; and what your name is.

Al quale e adviso che lemani et li denti habbiano perso il loro ordine naturale et deltutto annichilati.’ To which Epistemon answered, As muchof the one as of the other, and nothing of either. Then saidPanurge:‘Lord, if you be so virtuous of intelligence as you be natu-rally relieved to the body, you should have pity of me. Fornature hath made us equal, but fortune hath some exaltedand others deprived; nevertheless is virtue often deprived andthe virtuous men despised; for before the last end none isgood.’ (The following is the passage as it stands in the firstedition. Urquhart seems to have rendered Rabelais’ indiffer-ent English into worse Scotch, and this, with probably theuse of contractions in his MS., or ‘the oddness’ of handwrit-ing which he owns to in his Logopandecteision (p.419, Mait.Club.

And, as he was about tohave begun some purpose, the companion said:‘Jam toties vos per sacra, perque deos deasque omnesobtestatus sum, ut si quae vos pietas permovet, egestatemmeam solaremini, nec hilum proficio clamans et ejulans.Sinite, quaeso, sinite, viri impii, quo me fata vocant abire;nec ultra vanis vestris interpellationibus obtundatis, memoresveteris illius adagii, quo venter famelicus auriculis careredicitur.’ Well, my friend, said Pantagruel, but cannot youspeak French?

If you will but set me to work, it will be as good as abalsamum for sore eyes to see me gulch and raven it. ForGod’s sake, give order for it. Then Pantagruel commandedthat they should carry him home and provide him good storeof victuals; which being done, he ate very well that evening,and, capon-like, went early to bed; then slept until dinner-time the next day, so that he made but three steps and oneleap from the bed to the board.Chapter 2.X.Chapter 2.X.Chapter 2.X.Chapter 2.X.Chapter 2.X.HHHHHooooow Pw Pw Pw Pw Pantagrantagrantagrantagrantagruel judged so equitably of a contruel judged so equitably of a contruel judged so equitably of a contruel judged so equitably of a contruel judged so equitably of a controoooovvvvversyersyersyersyersy,,,,,which was wonderwhich was wonderwhich was wonderwhich was wonderwhich was wonderfully obscurfully obscurfully obscurfully obscurfully obscure and difficult, that, be and difficult, that, be and difficult, that, be and difficult, that, be and difficult, that, byyyyyrrrrreason of his just decreason of his just decreason of his just decreason of his just decreason of his just decree theree theree theree theree therein, he was rein, he was rein, he was rein, he was rein, he was reputed to haveputed to haveputed to haveputed to haveputed to have ae ae ae ae amost admirable judgment.most admirable judgment.most admirable judgment.most admirable judgment.most admirable judgment.Pantagruel, very well remembering his father’s letter and ad-monitions, would one day make trial of his knowledge.

The roasteror turnspit fell asleep by the divine will, or else by the virtueof some good Mercury, who cunningly brought Argus into asleep for all his hundred eyes. When I saw that he did nolonger turn me in roasting, I looked upon him, and per-ceived that he was fast asleep. Then took I up in my teeth afirebrand by the end where it was not burnt, and cast it intothe lap of my roaster, and another did I throw as well as Icould under a field-couch that was placed near to the chim-ney, wherein was the straw-bed of my master turnspit. Pres-ently the fire took hold in the straw, and from the straw tothe bed, and from the bed to the loft, which was plankedand ceiled with fir, after the fashion of the foot of a lamp.But the best was, that the fire which I had cast into the lap ofmy paltry roaster burnt all his groin, and was beginning tocease (seize) upon his cullions, when he became sensible ofthe danger, for his smelling was not so bad but that he felt itsooner than he could have seen daylight. Then suddenly get-ting up, and in a great amazement running to the window,he cried out to the streets as high as he could, Dal baroth,dal baroth, dal baroth, which is as much to say as Fire, fire,fire. Incontinently turning about, he came straight towardsme to throw me quite into the fire, and to that effect hadalready cut the ropes wherewith my hands were tied, andwas undoing the cords from off my feet, when the master ofthe house hearing him cry Fire, and smelling the smoke fromthe very street where he was walking with some other Bashawsand Mustaphas, ran with all the speed he had to save whathe could, and to carry away his jewels. Yet such was his rage,before he could well resolve how to go about it, that he caughtthe broach whereon I was spitted and therewith killed myroaster stark dead, of which wound he died there for want ofgovernment or otherwise; for he ran him in with the spit alittle above the navel, towards the right flank, till he piercedthe third lappet of his liver, and the blow slanting upwardsfrom the midriff or diaphragm, through which it had made"},{"pageNumber":226,"pageContent":"226Gargantua & Pantagruelpenetration, the spit passed athwart the pericardium or cap-sule of his heart, and came out above at his shoulders, be-twixt the spondyls or turning joints of the chine of the backand the left homoplat, which we call the shoulder-blade.True it is, for I will not lie, that, in drawing the spit out ofmy body I fell to the ground near unto the andirons, and soby the fall took some hurt, which indeed had been greater,but that the lardons, or little slices of bacon wherewith I wasstuck, kept off the blow. My Bashaw then seeing the case tobe desperate, his house burnt without remission, and all hisgoods lost, gave himself over unto all the devils in hell, call-ing upon some of them by their names, Grilgoth, Astaroth,Rappalus, and Gribouillis, nine several times. Which when Isaw, I had above sixpence’ worth of fear, dreading that thedevils would come even then to carry away this fool, and,seeing me so near him, would perhaps snatch me up to. I amalready, thought I, half roasted, and my lardons will be thecause of my mischief; for these devils are very liquorous oflardons, according to the authority which you have of thephilosopher Jamblicus, and Murmault, in the Apology ofBossutis, adulterated pro magistros nostros. But for my bet-ter security I made the sign of the cross, crying, Hageos,athanatos, ho theos, and none came. At which my rogueBashaw being very much aggrieved would, in transpiercinghis heart with my spit, have killed himself, and to that pur-pose had set it against his breast, but it could not enter, be-cause it was not sharp enough. Whereupon I perceiving thathe was not like to work upon his body the effect which heintended, although he did not spare all the force he had tothrust it forward, came up to him and said, Master Bugrino,thou dost here but trifle away thy time, or rashly lose it, forthou wilt never kill thyself thus as thou doest. Well, thoumayst hurt or bruise somewhat within thee, so as to makethee languish all thy lifetime most pitifully amongst the handsof the chirurgeons; but if thou wilt be counselled by me, Iwill kill thee clear outright, so that thou shalt not so much asfeel it, and trust me, for I have killed a great many others,who have found themselves very well after it. Ha, my friend,said he, I prithee do so, and for thy pains I will give thee mycodpiece (budget); take, here it is, there are six hundred ser-aphs in it, and some fine diamonds and most excellent ru-bies.

This was the greatestcare that Villon the Parisian poet took. Make an end, saidPantagruel, that we may know how thou didst dress thyBashaw. By the faith of an honest man, said Panurge, I do notlie in one word. I swaddled him in a scurvy swathel-bindingwhich I found lying there half burnt, and with my cords tiedhim roister-like both hand and foot, in such sort that he wasnot able to wince; then passed my spit through his throat, andhanged him thereon, fastening the end thereof at two greathooks or crampirons, upon which they did hang their halberds;and then, kindling a fair fire under him, did flame you up myMilourt, as they use to do dry herrings in a chimney. Withthis, taking his budget and a little javelin that was upon theforesaid hooks, I ran away a fair gallop-rake, and God he knowshow I did smell my shoulder of mutton.When I was come down into the street, I found everybodycome to put out the fire with store of water, and seeing meso half-roasted, they did naturally pity my case, and threwall their water upon me, which, by a most joyful refreshingof me, did me very much good. Then did they present mewith some victuals, but I could not eat much, because theygave me nothing to drink but water after their fashion. Otherhurt they did me none, only one little villainous Turkeyknobbreasted rogue came thiefteously to snatch away someof my lardons, but I gave him such a sturdy thump and soundrap on the fingers with all the weight of my javelin, that hecame no more the second time. Shortly after this there cametowards me a pretty young Corinthian wench, who broughtme a boxful of conserves, of round Mirabolan plums, calledemblicks, and looked upon my poor robin with an eye ofgreat compassion, as it was flea-bitten and pinked with thesparkles of the fire from whence it came, for it reached nofarther in length, believe me, than my knees. But note thatthis roasting cured me entirely of a sciatica, whereunto I hadbeen subject above seven years before, upon that side whichmy roaster by falling asleep suffered to be burnt.Now, whilst they were thus busy about me, the fire tri-umphed, never ask how? For it took hold on above two thou-sand houses, which one of them espying cried out, saying,By Mahoom’s belly, all the city is on fire, and we do never-theless stand gazing here, without offering to make any re-"},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":"228Gargantua & Pantagruellief. Upon this everyone ran to save his own; for my part, Itook my way towards the gate. When I was got upon theknap of a little hillock not far off, I turned me about as didLot’s wife, and, looking back, saw all the city burning in afair fire, whereat I was so glad that I had almost beshit my-self for joy. But God punished me well for it. How? saidPantagruel. Thus, said Panurge; for when with pleasure Ibeheld this jolly fire, jesting with myself, and saying—Ha!poor flies, ha! poor mice, you will have a bad winter of it thisyear; the fire is in your reeks, it is in your bed-straw—outcome more than six, yea, more than thirteen hundred andeleven dogs, great and small, altogether out of the town, fly-ing away from the fire. At the first approach they ran allupon me, being carried on by the scent of my lecherous half-roasted flesh, and had even then devoured me in a trice, ifmy good angel had not well inspired me with the instruc-tion of a remedy very sovereign against the toothache. Andwherefore, said Pantagruel, wert thou afraid of the tooth-ache or pain of the teeth? Wert thou not cured of thy rheums?By Palm Sunday, said Panurge, is there any greater pain ofthe teeth than when the dogs have you by the legs? But on asudden, as my good angel directed me, I thought upon mylardons, and threw them into the midst of the field amongstthem. Then did the dogs run, and fight with one another atfair teeth which should have the lardons. By this means theyleft me, and I left them also bustling with and hairing oneanother.

Yea but, said Epistemon, if thou shouldst be setupon, how wouldst thou defend thyself? With greatbuskinades or brodkin blows, answered he, provided thrustswere forbidden. At their return, Panurge considered the wallsof the city of Paris, and in derision said to Pantagruel, Seewhat fair walls here are! O how strong they are, and wellfitted to keep geese in a mew or coop to fatten them! By mybeard, they are competently scurvy for such a city as this is;for a cow with one fart would go near to overthrow above sixfathoms of them. O my friend, said Pantagruel, dost thouknow what Agesilaus said when he was asked why the greatcity of Lacedaemon was not enclosed with walls? Lo here,said he, the walls of the city! in showing them the inhabit-ants and citizens thereof, so strong, so well armed, and soexpert in military discipline; signifying thereby that there isno wall but of bones, and that towns and cities cannot havea surer wall nor better fortification than the prowess andvirtue of the citizens and inhabitants. So is this city so strong,by the great number of warlike people that are in it, thatthey care not for making any other walls. Besides, whoso-ever would go about to wall it, as Strasbourg, Orleans, orFerrara, would find it almost impossible, the cost and chargeswould be so excessive. Yea but, said Panurge, it is good, nev-ertheless, to have an outside of stone when we are invadedby our enemies, were it but to ask, Who is below there? Asfor the enormous expense which you say would be needfulfor undertaking the great work of walling this city about, ifthe gentlemen of the town will be pleased to give me a goodrough cup of wine, I will show them a pretty, strange, andnew way, how they may build them good cheap. How? saidPantagruel. Do not speak of it then, answered Panurge, andI will tell it you. I see that the sine quo nons, kallibistris, orcontrapunctums of the women of this country are bettercheap than stones. Of them should the walls be built, rang-ing them in good symmetry by the rules of architecture, andplacing the largest in the first ranks, then sloping downwardsridge-wise, like the back of an ass. The middle-sized onesmust be ranked next, and last of all the least and smallest.This done, there must be a fine little interlacing of them,like points of diamonds, as is to be seen in the great tower ofBourges, with a like number of the nudinnudos,"},{"pageNumber":230,"pageContent":"230Gargantua & Pantagruelnilnisistandos, and stiff bracmards, that dwell in amongstthe claustral codpieces.

Beware, in the name of the devils,and hold off. Furthermore, no thunderbolt or lightning wouldfall upon it. For why? They are all either blest or consecrated.I see but one inconveniency in it. Ho, ho, ha, ha, ha! saidPantagruel, and what is that? It is, that the flies would be soliquorish of them that you would wonder, and would quicklygather there together, and there leave their ordure and excre-tions, and so all the work would be spoiled. But see how thatmight be remedied: they must be wiped and made rid of theflies with fair foxtails, or great good viedazes, which are ass-pizzles, of Provence. And to this purpose I will tell you, as wego to supper, a brave example set down by Frater Lubinus,Libro de compotationibus mendicantium.In the time that the beasts did speak, which is not yet threedays since, a poor lion, walking through the forest of Bieure,and saying his own little private devotions, passed under atree where there was a roguish collier gotten up to cut downwood, who, seeing the lion, cast his hatchet at him andwounded him enormously in one of his legs; whereupon thelion halting, he so long toiled and turmoiled himself in roam-ing up and down the forest to find help, that at last he metwith a carpenter, who willingly looked upon his wound,cleansed it as well as he could, and filled it with moss, tellinghim that he must wipe his wound well that the flies mightnot do their excrements in it, whilst he should go search forsome yarrow or millefoil, commonly called the carpenter’sherb. The lion, being thus healed, walked along in the forestat what time a sempiternous crone and old hag was pickingup and gathering some sticks in the said forest, who, seeingthe lion coming towards her, for fear fell down backwards,in such sort that the wind blew up her gown, coats, andsmock, even as far as above her shoulders; which the lionperceiving, for pity ran to see whether she had taken anyhurt by the fall, and thereupon considering her how do youcall it, said, O poor woman, who hath thus wounded thee?Which words when he had spoken, he espied a fox, whomhe called to come to him saying, Gossip Reynard, hau, hither,"},{"pageNumber":231,"pageContent":"231Rabelaishither, and for cause! When the fox was come, he said untohim, My gossip and friend, they have hurt this good womanhere between the legs most villainously, and there is a mani-fest solution of continuity. See how great a wound it is, evenfrom the tail up to the navel, in measure four, nay full fivehandfuls and a half. This is the blow of a hatchet, I doubtme; it is an old wound, and therefore, that the flies may notget into it, wipe it lustily well and hard, I prithee, both withinand without; thou hast a good tail, and long. Wipe, my friend,wipe, I beseech thee, and in the meanwhile I will go getsome moss to put into it; for thus ought we to succour andhelp one another. Wipe it hard, thus, my friend; wipe it well,for this wound must be often wiped, otherwise the partycannot be at ease. Go to, wipe well, my little gossip, wipe;God hath furnished thee with a tail; thou hast a long one,and of a bigness proportionable; wipe hard, and be not weary.A good wiper, who, in wiping continually, wipeth with hiswipard, by wasps shall never be wounded. Wipe, my prettyminion; wipe, my little bully; I will not stay long. Then wenthe to get store of moss; and when he was a little way off, hecried out in speaking to the fox thus, Wipe well still, gossip,wipe, and let it never grieve thee to wipe well, my little gos-sip; I will put thee into service to be wiper to Don Pedro deCastile; wipe, only wipe, and no more. The poor fox wipedas hard as he could, here and there, within and without; butthe false old trot did so fizzle and fist that she stunk like ahundred devils, which put the poor fox to a great deal of illease, for he knew not to what side to turn himself to escapethe unsavoury perfume of this old woman’s postern blasts.And whilst to that effect he was shifting hither and thither,without knowing how to shun the annoyance of those un-wholesome gusts, he saw that behind there was yet anotherhole, not so great as that which he did wipe, out of whichcame this filthy and infectious air. The lion at last returned,bringing with him of moss more than eighteen packs wouldhold, and began to put into the wound with a staff which hehad provided for that purpose, and had already put in fullsixteen packs and a half, at which he was amazed. What adevil! said he, this wound is very deep; it would hold abovetwo cartloads of moss.

Then said Pantagruel,How dost thou know that the privy parts of women are atsuch a cheap rate? For in this city there are many virtuous,honest, and chaste women besides the maids. Et ubi prenus?said Panurge. I will give you my opinion of it, and that uponcertain and assured knowledge. I do not brag that I havebumbasted four hundred and seventeen since I came intothis city, though it be but nine days ago; but this very morn-ing I met with a good fellow, who, in a wallet such as Aesop’swas, carried two little girls of two or three years old at themost, one before and the other behind. He demanded almsof me, but I made him answer that I had more cods thanpence. Afterwards I asked him, Good man, these two girls,are they maids? Brother, said he, I have carried them thusthese two years, and in regard of her that is before, whom Isee continually, in my opinion she is a virgin, nevertheless Iwill not put my finger in the fire for it; as for her that isbehind, doubtless I can say nothing.Indeed, said Pantagruel, thou art a gentle companion; Iwill have thee to be apparelled in my livery. And thereforecaused him to be clothed most gallantly according to thefashion that then was, only that Panurge would have thecodpiece of his breeches three foot long, and in shape square,not round; which was done, and was well worth the seeing.Oftentimes was he wont to say, that the world had not yetknown the emolument and utility that is in wearing greatcodpieces; but time would one day teach it them, as all thingshave been invented in time. God keep from hurt, said he,the good fellow whose long codpiece or braguet hath savedhis life! God keep from hurt him whose long braguet hathbeen worth to him in one day one hundred threescore thou-sand and nine crowns! God keep from hurt him who by hislong braguet hath saved a whole city from dying by famine!And, by G—, I will make a book of the commodity of longbraguets when I shall have more leisure.

He was at that time five and thirty years old or there-abouts, fine to gild like a leaden dagger—for he was a no-table cheater and coney-catcher—he was a very gallant andproper man of his person, only that he was a little lecherous,and naturally subject to a kind of disease which at that timethey called lack of money—it is an incomparable grief, yet,notwithstanding, he had three score and three tricks to comeby it at his need, of which the most honourable and mostordinary was in manner of thieving, secret purloining andfilching, for he was a wicked lewd rogue, a cozener, drinker,roister, rover, and a very dissolute and debauched fellow, ifthere were any in Paris; otherwise, and in all matters else, thebest and most virtuous man in the world; and he was stillcontriving some plot, and devising mischief against the ser-geants and the watch.At one time he assembled three or four especial goodhacksters and roaring boys, made them in the evening drinklike Templars, afterwards led them till they came under St.Genevieve, or about the college of Navarre, and, at the hourthat the watch was coming up that way—which he knew byputting his sword upon the pavement, and his ear by it, and,when he heard his sword shake, it was an infallible sign thatthe watch was near at that instant—then he and his com-panions took a tumbrel or dung-cart, and gave it the brangle,hurling it with all their force down the hill, and so overthrewall the poor watchmen like pigs, and then ran away upon theother side; for in less than two days he knew all the streets,lanes, and turnings in Paris as well as his Deus det.At another time he made in some fair place, where the saidwatch was to pass, a train of gunpowder, and, at the veryinstant that they went along, set fire to it, and then madehimself sport to see what good grace they had in runningaway, thinking that St. Anthony’s fire had caught them bythe legs.

One day that they were appointed all to meetin the Fodder Street (Sorbonne), he made a Borbonesa tart,or filthy and slovenly compound, made of store of garlic, ofassafoetida, of castoreum, of dogs’ turds very warm, whichhe steeped, tempered, and liquefied in the corrupt matter ofpocky boils and pestiferous botches; and, very early in themorning therewith anointed all the pavement, in such sortthat the devil could not have endured it, which made allthese good people there to lay up their gorges, and vomitwhat was upon their stomachs before all the world, as if theyhad flayed the fox; and ten or twelve of them died of theplague, fourteen became lepers, eighteen grew lousy, andabout seven and twenty had the pox, but he did not care abutton for it. He commonly carried a whip under his gown,wherewith he whipped without remission the pages whomhe found carrying wine to their masters, to make them mendtheir pace. In his coat he had above six and twenty little fobsand pockets always full; one with some lead-water, and alittle knife as sharp as a glover’s needle, wherewith he used tocut purses; another with some kind of bitter stuff, which hethrew into the eyes of those he met; another with clotburrs,penned with little geese’ or capon’s feathers, which he castupon the gowns and caps of honest people, and often madethem fair horns, which they wore about all the city, some-times all their life. Very often, also, upon the women’s Frenchhoods would he stick in the hind part somewhat made inthe shape of a man’s member. In another, he had a greatmany little horns full of fleas and lice, which he borrowedfrom the beggars of St. Innocent, and cast them with smallcanes or quills to write with into the necks of the daintiestgentlewomen that he could find, yea, even in the church, forhe never seated himself above in the choir, but always sat inthe body of the church amongst the women, both at mass,at vespers, and at sermon. In another, he used to have goodstore of hooks and buckles, wherewith he would couple menand women together that sat in company close to one an-other, but especially those that wore gowns of crimsontaffeties, that, when they were about to go away, they mightrend all their gowns.

One time, atthe entry of the palace unto the great hall, where a certaingrey friar or cordelier was to say mass to the counsellors, hedid help to apparel him and put on his vestments, but in theaccoutring of him he sewed on his alb, surplice, or stole, tohis gown and shirt, and then withdrew himself when thesaid lords of the court or counsellors came to hear the saidmass; but when it came to the Ite, missa est, that the poorfrater would have laid by his stole or surplice, as the fashionthen was, he plucked off withal both his frock and shirt,which were well sewed together, and thereby stripping him-self up to the very shoulders showed his bel vedere to all theworld, together with his Don Cypriano, which was no smallone, as you may imagine. And the friar still kept haling, butso much the more did he discover himself and lay open hisback parts, till one of the lords of the court said, How now!what’s the matter? Will this fair father make us here an offer-ing of his tail to kiss it? Nay, St. Anthony’s fire kiss it for us!From thenceforth it was ordained that the poor fathers shouldnever disrobe themselves any more before the world, but intheir vestry-room, or sextry, as they call it; especially in thepresence of women, lest it should tempt them to the sin oflonging and disordinate desire. The people then asked whyit was the friars had so long and large genitories? The saidPanurge resolved the problem very neatly, saying, That whichmakes asses to have such great ears is that their dams did putno biggins on their heads, as Alliaco mentioneth in his Sup-positions. By the like reason, that which makes the genitoriesor generation-tools of those so fair fraters so long is, for thatthey wear no bottomed breeches, and therefore their jollymember, having no impediment, hangeth dangling at lib-erty as far as it can reach, with a wiggle-waggle down to theirknees, as women carry their paternoster beads. and the cause"},{"pageNumber":236,"pageContent":"236Gargantua & Pantagruelwherefore they have it so correspondently great is, that inthis constant wig-wagging the humours of the body descendinto the said member.

Others, again, ran about the streets, and he would runafter them. To such as were in the stripping vein he wouldvery civilly come to offer his attendance, and cover themwith his cloak, like a courteous and very gracious man.Item, in another he had a little leather bottle full of old oil,wherewith, when he saw any man or woman in a rich newhandsome suit, he would grease, smutch, and spoil all thebest parts of it under colour and pretence of touching them,saying, This is good cloth; this is good satin; good taffeties!Madam, God give you all that your noble heart desireth!You have a new suit, pretty sir;—and you a new gown, sweetmistress;—God give you joy of it, and maintain you in allprosperity!

By my faith, said I, I am no greatpardon-taker in this world—if I shall be any such in theother, I cannot tell; yet let us go, in God’s name; it is but onefarthing more or less; But, said he, lend me then a farthingupon interest.

Grates vobis dominos, said he.So we went along, beginning at St. Gervase, and I got thepardons at the first box only, for in those matters very littlecontenteth me. Then did I say my small suffrages and theprayers of St. Brigid; but he gained them all at the boxes,and always gave money to everyone of the pardoners. Fromthence we went to Our Lady’s Church, to St. John’s, to St.Anthony’s, and so to the other churches, where there was abanquet (bank) of pardons. For my part, I gained no moreof them, but he at all the boxes kissed the relics, and gave ateveryone. To be brief, when we were returned, he broughtme to drink at the castle-tavern, and there showed me ten ortwelve of his little bags full of money, at which I blessedmyself, and made the sign of the cross, saying, Where haveyou recovered so much money in so little time? Unto whichhe answered me that he had taken it out of the basins of thepardons. For in giving them the first farthing, said he, I putit in with such sleight of hand and so dexterously that itappeared to be a threepence; thus with one hand I tookthreepence, ninepence, or sixpence at the least, and with theother as much, and so through all the churches where wehave been. Yea but, said I, you damn yourself like a snake,and are withal a thief and sacrilegious person. True, said he,in your opinion, but I am not of that mind; for the pardon-ers do give me it, when they say unto me in presenting therelics to kiss, Centuplum accipies, that is, that for one pennyI should take a hundred; for accipies is spoken according tothe manner of the Hebrews, who use the future tense in-stead of the imperative, as you have in the law, DiligesDominum, that is, Dilige. Even so, when the pardon-bearersays to me, Centuplum accipies, his meaning is, Centuplumaccipe; and so doth Rabbi Kimy and Rabbi Aben Ezra ex-pound it, and all the Massorets, et ibi Bartholus. Moreover,Pope Sixtus gave me fifteen hundred francs of yearly pen-sion, which in English money is a hundred and fifty pounds,upon his ecclesiastical revenues and treasure, for having curedhim of a cankerous botch, which did so torment him that hethought to have been a cripple by it all his life. Thus I do paymyself at my own hand, for otherwise I get nothing uponthe said ecclesiastical treasure.

It was worth to me above six thousandflorins, in English coin six hundred pounds. And what adevil is become of them? said I; for of that money thou hastnot one halfpenny. They returned from whence they came,said he; they did no more but change their master.But I employed at least three thousand of them, that is,three hundred pounds English, in marrying—not young vir-gins, for they find but too many husbands—but great oldsempiternous trots which had not so much as one tooth intheir heads; and that out of the consideration I had that thesegood old women had very well spent the time of their youthin playing at the close-buttock game to all comers, servingthe foremost first, till no man would have any more dealingwith them. And, by G—, I will have their skin-coat shakenonce yet before they die. By this means, to one I gave a hun-dred florins, to another six score, to another three hundred,according to that they were infamous, detestable, and abomi-nable. For, by how much the more horrible and execrablethey were, so much the more must I needs have given them,otherwise the devil would not have jummed them. PresentlyI went to some great and fat wood-porter, or such like, anddid myself make the match. But, before I did show him theold hags, I made a fair muster to him of the crowns, saying,Good fellow, see what I will give thee if thou wilt but conde-scend to duffle, dinfredaille, or lecher it one good time. Thenbegan the poor rogues to gape like old mules, and I causedto be provided for them a banquet, with drink of the best,and store of spiceries, to put the old women in rut and heatof lust. To be short, they occupied all, like good souls; only,to those that were horribly ugly and ill-favoured, I causedtheir head to be put within a bag, to hide their face.Besides all this, I have lost a great deal in suits of law. Andwhat lawsuits couldst thou have? said I; thou hast neitherhouse nor lands. My friend, said he, the gentlewomen ofthis city had found out, by the instigation of the devil ofhell, a manner of high-mounted bands and neckerchiefs forwomen, which did so closely cover their bosoms that mencould no more put their hands under. For they had put theslit behind, and those neckcloths were wholly shut before,whereat the poor sad contemplative lovers were much dis-contented. Upon a fair Tuesday I presented a petition to thecourt, making myself a party against the said gentlewomen,"},{"pageNumber":240,"pageContent":"240Gargantua & Pantagrueland showing the great interest that I pretended therein, pro-testing that by the same reason I would cause the codpieceof my breeches to be sewed behind, if the court would nottake order for it. In sum, the gentlewomen put in their de-fences, showing the grounds they went upon, and consti-tuted their attorney for the prosecuting of the cause. But Ipursued them so vigorously, that by a sentence of the courtit was decreed those high neckcloths should be no longerworn if they were not a little cleft and open before; but itcost me a good sum of money. I had another very filthy andbeastly process against the dung-farmer called Master Fifiand his deputies, that they should no more read privily thepipe, puncheon, nor quart of sentences, but in fair full day,and that in the Fodder schools, in face of the Arrian (Artitian)sophisters, where I was ordained to pay the charges, by rea-son of some clause mistaken in the relation of the sergeant.Another time I framed a complaint to the court against themules of the presidents, counsellors, and others, tending tothis purpose, that, when in the lower court of the palacethey left them to champ on their bridles, some bibs weremade for them (by the counsellors’ wives), that with theirdrivelling they might not spoil the pavement; to the end thatthe pages of the palace what play upon it with their dice, orat the game of coxbody, at their own ease, without spoilingtheir breeches at the knees. And for this I had a fair decree,but it cost me dear. Now reckon up what expense I was at inlittle banquets which from day to day I made to the pages ofthe palace. And to what end? said I. My friend, said he, thouhast no pastime at all in this world. I have more than theking, and if thou wilt join thyself with me, we will do thedevil together.

Inthis resolution being arrived at Paris, he went forthwith untothe house of the said Pantagruel, who was lodged in the pal-ace of St. Denis, and was then walking in the garden thereofwith Panurge, philosophizing after the fashion of the Peripa-tetics. At his first entrance he startled, and was almost out ofhis wits for fear, seeing him so great and so tall. Then did hesalute him courteously as the manner is, and said unto him,Very true it is, saith Plato the prince of philosophers, that ifthe image and knowledge of wisdom were corporeal and vis-ible to the eyes of mortals, it would stir up all the world toadmire her. Which we may the rather believe that the verybare report thereof, scattered in the air, if it happen to bereceived into the ears of men, who, for being studious andlovers of virtuous things are called philosophers, doth notsuffer them to sleep nor rest in quiet, but so pricketh themup and sets them on fire to run unto the place where theperson is, in whom the said knowledge is said to have builther temple and uttered her oracles. As it was manifestly shownunto us in the Queen of Sheba, who came from the utmostborders of the East and Persian Sea, to see the order ofSolomon’s house and to hear his wisdom; in Anacharsis, whocame out of Scythia, even unto Athens, to see Solon; inPythagoras, who travelled far to visit the memphitical vatici-nators; in Plato, who went a great way off to see the magi-cians of Egypt, and Architus of Tarentum; in ApolloniusTyaneus, who went as far as unto Mount Caucasus, passedalong the Scythians, the Massagetes, the Indians, and sailed"},{"pageNumber":242,"pageContent":"242Gargantua & Pantagruelover the great river Phison, even to the Brachmans to seeHiarchus; as likewise unto Babylon, Chaldea, Media, Assyria,Parthia, Syria, Phoenicia, Arabia, Palestina, and Alexandria,even unto Aethiopia, to see the Gymnosophists. The likeexample have we of Titus Livius, whom to see and hear diversstudious persons came to Rome from the confines of Franceand Spain. I dare not reckon myself in the number of thoseso excellent persons, but well would be called studious, anda lover, not only of learning, but of learned men also. Andindeed, having heard the report of your so inestimable knowl-edge, I have left my country, my friends, my kindred, andmy house, and am come thus far, valuing at nothing thelength of the way, the tediousness of the sea, nor strangenessof the land, and that only to see you and to confer with youabout some passages in philosophy, of geomancy, and of thecabalistic art, whereof I am doubtful and cannot satisfy mymind; which if you can resolve, I yield myself unto you for aslave henceforward, together with all my posterity, for othergift have I none that I can esteem a recompense sufficientfor so great a favour. I will reduce them into writing, and to-morrow publish them to all the learned men in the city, thatwe may dispute publicly before them.But see in what manner I mean that we shall dispute. I willnot argue pro et contra, as do the sottish sophisters of thistown and other places. Likewise I will not dispute after themanner of the Academics by declamation; nor yet by num-bers, as Pythagoras was wont to do, and as Picus de laMirandula did of late at Rome. But I will dispute by signsonly without speaking, for the matters are so abstruse, hard,and arduous, that words proceeding from the mouth of manwill never be sufficient for unfolding of them to my liking.May it, therefore, please your magnificence to be there; itshall be at the great hall of Navarre at seven o’clock in themorning. When he had spoken these words, Pantagruel veryhonourably said unto him: Sir, of the graces that God hathbestowed upon me, I would not deny to communicate untoany man to my power. For whatever comes from him is good,and his pleasure is that it should be increased when we comeamongst men worthy and fit to receive this celestial mannaof honest literature.

And I do highly com-mend the manner of arguing which thou hast proposed, towit, by signs without speaking; for by this means thou and Ishall understand one another well enough, and yet shall befree from this clapping of hands which these blockish sophistersmake when any of the arguers hath gotten the better of theargument. Now to-morrow I will not fail to meet thee at theplace and hour that thou hast appointed, but let me entreatthee that there be not any strife or uproar between us, andthat we seek not the honour and applause of men, but thetruth only. To which Thaumast answered: The Lord Godmaintain you in his favour and grace, and, instead of my thank-fulness to you, pour down his blessings upon you, for thatyour highness and magnificent greatness hath not disdainedto descend to the grant of the request of my poor baseness. Sofarewell till to-morrow! Farewell, said Pantagruel.Gentlemen, you that read this present discourse, think notthat ever men were more elevated and transported in theirthoughts than all this night were both Thaumast andPantagruel; for the said Thaumast said to the keeper of thehouse of Cluny, where he was lodged, that in all his life hehad never known himself so dry as he was that night. I think,said he, that Pantagruel held me by the throat. Give order, Ipray you, that we may have some drink, and see that somefresh water be brought to us, to gargle my palate. On theother side, Pantagruel stretched his wits as high as he could,entering into very deep and serious meditations, and didnothing all that night but dote upon and turn over the bookof Beda, De numeris et signis; Plotin’s book, Deinenarrabilibus; the book of Proclus, De magia; the book ofArtemidorus (Greek); of Anaxagoras, (Greek); Dinarius,(Greek); the books of Philiston; Hipponax, (Greek), and arabble of others, so long, that Panurge said unto him:My lord, leave all these thoughts and go to bed; for I per-ceive your spirits to be so troubled by a too intensive bend-ing of them, that you may easily fall into some quotidianfever with this so excessive thinking and plodding. But, hav-"},{"pageNumber":244,"pageContent":"244Gargantua & Pantagrueling first drunk five and twenty or thirty good draughts, re-tire yourself and sleep your fill, for in the morning I willargue against and answer my master the Englishman, and ifI drive him not ad metam non loqui, then call me knave. Yeabut, said he, my friend Panurge, he is marvellously learned;how wilt thou be able to answer him? Very well, answeredPanurge; I pray you talk no more of it, but let me alone. Isany man so learned as the devils are? No, indeed, saidPantagruel, without God’s especial grace. Yet for all that, saidPanurge, I have argued against them, gravelled and blankedthem in disputation, and laid them so squat upon their tailsthat I have made them look like monkeys. Therefore be as-sured that to-morrow I will make this vain-glorious English-man to skite vinegar before all the world. So Panurge spentthe night with tippling amongst the pages, and played awayall the points of his breeches at primus secundus and at peckpoint, in French called La Vergette. Yet, when the conde-scended on time was come, he failed not to conduct his masterPantagruel to the appointed place, unto which, believe me,there was neither great nor small in Paris but came, thinkingwith themselves that this devilish Pantagruel, who had over-thrown and vanquished in dispute all these doting fresh-watersophisters, would now get full payment and be tickled tosome purpose. For this Englishman is a terrible bustler andhorrible coil-keeper. We will see who will be conqueror, forhe never met with his match before.Thus all being assembled, Thaumast stayed for them, andthen, when Pantagruel and Panurge came into the hall, allthe schoolboys, professors of arts, senior sophisters, and bach-elors began to clap their hands, as their scurvy custom is.But Pantagruel cried out with a loud voice, as if it had beenthe sound of a double cannon, saying, Peace, with a devil toyou, peace! By G—, you rogues, if you trouble me here, Iwill cut off the heads of everyone of you. At which wordsthey remained all daunted and astonished like so many ducks,and durst not do so much as cough, although they had swal-lowed fifteen pounds of feathers. Withal they grew so drywith this only voice, that they laid out their tongues a fullhalf foot beyond their mouths, as if Pantagruel had salted alltheir throats. Then began Panurge to speak, saying to theEnglishman, Sir, are you come hither to dispute contentiouslyin those propositions you have set down, or, otherwise, but"},{"pageNumber":245,"pageContent":"245Rabelaisto learn and know the truth? To which answered Thaumast,Sir, no other thing brought me hither but the great desire Ihad to learn and to know that of which I have doubted allmy life long, and have neither found book nor man able tocontent me in the resolution of those doubts which I haveproposed. And, as for disputing contentiously, I will not doit, for it is too base a thing, and therefore leave it to thosesottish sophisters who in their disputes do not search for thetruth, but for contradiction only and debate. Then saidPanurge, If I, who am but a mean and inconsiderable dis-ciple of my master my lord Pantagruel, content and satisfyyou in all and everything, it were a thing below my said masterwherewith to trouble him. Therefore is it fitter that he bechairman, and sit as a judge and moderator of our discourseand purpose, and give you satisfaction in many things whereinperhaps I shall be wanting to your expectation. Truly, saidThaumast, it is very well said; begin then. Now you mustnote that Panurge had set at the end of his long codpiece apretty tuft of red silk, as also of white, green, and blue, andwithin it had put a fair orange.Chapter 2.XIX.Chapter 2.XIX.Chapter 2.XIX.Chapter 2.XIX.Chapter 2.XIX.HHHHHooooow Pw Pw Pw Pw Panurge put to a nonplus the Eanurge put to a nonplus the Eanurge put to a nonplus the Eanurge put to a nonplus the Eanurge put to a nonplus the Englishman thatnglishman thatnglishman thatnglishman thatnglishman thatargued bargued bargued bargued bargued by signs.y signs.y signs.y signs.y signs.Everybody then taking heed, and hearkening with great si-lence, the Englishman lift up on high into the air his twohands severally, clunching in all the tops of his fingers to-gether, after the manner which, a la Chinonnese, they callthe hen’s arse, and struck the one hand on the other by thenails four several times. Then he, opening them, struck theone with the flat of the other till it yielded a clashing noise,and that only once. Again, in joining them as before, hestruck twice, and afterwards four times in opening them.Then did he lay them joined, and extended the one towardsthe other, as if he had been devoutly to send up his prayersunto God.

This done, inthe same form he abased towards the ground about the oneand the other hand. Lastly, he held them in the midst, asaiming right at the Englishman’s nose. And if Mercury,—said the Englishman. There Panurge interrupted him, andsaid, You have spoken, Mask.Then made the Englishman this sign. His left hand allopen he lifted up into the air, then instantly shut into his fistthe four fingers thereof, and his thumb extended at lengthhe placed upon the gristle of his nose. Presently after, helifted up his right hand all open, and all open abased andbent it downwards, putting the thumb thereof in the veryplace where the little finger of the left hand did close in thefist, and the four right-hand fingers he softly moved in theair. Then contrarily he did with the right hand what he haddone with the left, and with the left what he had done withthe right.Panurge, being not a whit amazed at this, drew out intothe air his trismegist codpiece with the left hand, and withhis right drew forth a truncheon of a white ox-rib, and twopieces of wood of a like form, one of black ebony and theother of incarnation brasil, and put them betwixt the fingersof that hand in good symmetry; then, knocking them to-gether, made such a noise as the lepers of Brittany use to dowith their clappering clickets, yet better resounding and farmore harmonious, and with his tongue contracted in hismouth did very merrily warble it, always looking fixedly uponthe Englishman. The divines, physicians, and chirurgeonsthat were there thought that by this sign he would have in-ferred that the Englishman was a leper. The counsellors, law-yers, and decretalists conceived that by doing this he wouldhave concluded some kind of mortal felicity to consist inleprosy, as the Lord maintained heretofore.The Englishman for all this was nothing daunted, but hold-ing up his two hands in the air, kept them in such form thathe closed the three master-fingers in his fist, and passing histhumbs through his indical or foremost and middle fingers,his auriculary or little fingers remained extended and stretched"},{"pageNumber":247,"pageContent":"247Rabelaisout, and so presented he them to Panurge. Then joined hethem so that the right thumb touched the left, and the leftlittle finger touched the right. Hereat Panurge, without speak-ing one word, lift up his hands and made this sign.He put the nail of the forefinger of his left hand to the nailof the thumb of the same, making in the middle of the dis-tance as it were a buckle, and of his right hand shut up allthe fingers into his fist, except the forefinger, which he oftenthrust in and out through the said two others of the lefthand. Then stretched he out the forefinger and middle fin-ger or medical of his right hand, holding them asunder asmuch as he could, and thrusting them towards Thaumast.Then did he put the thumb of his left hand upon the cornerof his left eye, stretching out all his hand like the wing of abird or the fin of a fish, and moving it very daintily this wayand that way, he did as much with his right hand upon thecorner of his right eye. Thaumast began then to wax some-what pale, and to tremble, and made him this sign.With the middle finger of his right hand he struck againstthe muscle of the palm or pulp which is under the thumb.Then put he the forefinger of the right hand in the like buckleof the left, but he put it under, and not over, as Panurge did.Then Panurge knocked one hand against another, and blowedin his palm, and put again the forefinger of his right handinto the overture or mouth of the left, pulling it often in andout. Then held he out his chin, most intentively lookingupon Thaumast. The people there, which understood noth-ing in the other signs, knew very well that therein he de-manded, without speaking a word to Thaumast, What doyou mean by that? In effect, Thaumast then began to sweatgreat drops, and seemed to all the spectators a man strangelyravished in high contemplation. Then he bethought him-self, and put all the nails of his left hand against those of hisright, opening his fingers as if they had been semicircles, andwith this sign lift up his hands as high as he could. Where-upon Panurge presently put the thumb of his right handunder his jaws, and the little finger thereof in the mouth ofthe left hand, and in this posture made his teeth to soundvery melodiously, the upper against the lower.

Whereat Panurge drewout his long codpiece with his tuff, and stretched it forth acubit and a half, holding it in the air with his right hand,and with his left took out his orange, and, casting it up intothe air seven times, at the eighth he hid it in the fist of hisright hand, holding it steadily up on high, and then beganto shake his fair codpiece, showing it to Thaumast.After that, Thaumast began to puff up his two cheeks likea player on a bagpipe, and blew as if he had been to puff upa pig’s bladder. Whereupon Panurge put one finger of hisleft hand in his nockandrow, by some called St. Patrick’s hole,and with his mouth sucked in the air, in such a manner aswhen one eats oysters in the shell, or when we sup up ourbroth. This done, he opened his mouth somewhat, and struckhis right hand flat upon it, making therewith a great and adeep sound, as if it came from the superficies of the midriffthrough the trachiartery or pipe of the lungs, and this he didfor sixteen times; but Thaumast did always keep blowinglike a goose. Then Panurge put the forefinger of his righthand into his mouth, pressing it very hard to the musclesthereof; then he drew it out, and withal made a great noise,as when little boys shoot pellets out of the pot-cannons madeof the hollow sticks of the branch of an alder-tree, and hedid it nine times.Then Thaumast cried out, Ha, my masters, a great secret!With this he put in his hand up to the elbow, then drew outa dagger that he had, holding it by the point downwards.Whereat Panurge took his long codpiece, and shook it ashard as he could against his thighs; then put his two handsentwined in manner of a comb upon his head, laying out histongue as far as he was able, and turning his eyes in his headlike a goat that is ready to die. Ha, I understand, saidThaumast, but what? making such a sign that he put thehaft of his dagger against his breast, and upon the pointthereof the flat of his hand, turning in a little the ends of hisfingers.

Then he lift up hisleft arm, and closing all his fingers into his fist, held his thumbagainst his forehead, striking with his right hand six timesagainst his breast. But Thaumast, as not content therewith,put the thumb of his left hand upon the top of his nose,shutting the rest of his said hand, whereupon Panurge set histwo master-fingers upon each side of his mouth, drawing itas much as he was able, and widening it so that he showedall his teeth, and with his two thumbs plucked down his twoeyelids very low, making therewith a very ill-favoured coun-tenance, as it seemed to the company.Chapter 2.XX.Chapter 2.XX.Chapter 2.XX.Chapter 2.XX.Chapter 2.XX.HHHHHooooow w w w w Thaumast rThaumast rThaumast rThaumast rThaumast relateth the virelateth the virelateth the virelateth the virelateth the virtues and knotues and knotues and knotues and knotues and knowledge ofwledge ofwledge ofwledge ofwledge ofPPPPPanurge.anurge.anurge.anurge.anurge.Then Panurge rose up, and, putting off his cap, did verykindly thank the said Panurge, and with a loud voice saidunto all the people that were there: My lords, gentlemen,and others, at this time may I to some good purpose speakthat evangelical word, Et ecce plus quam Salomon hic!

Andtherefore, that we lose no time, put on, thrust out yourgammons!—and would have embraced her, but she made asif she would put out her head at the window to call herneighbours for help. Then Panurge on a sudden ran out, andin his running away said, Madam, stay here till I come again;I will go call them myself; do not you take so much pains.Thus went he away, not much caring for the repulse he hadgot, nor made he any whit the worse cheer for it. The nextday he came to the church at the time she went to mass. Atthe door he gave her some of the holy water, bowing himselfvery low before her. Afterwards he kneeled down by her veryfamiliarly and said unto her, Madam, know that I am soamorous of you that I can neither piss nor dung for love. Ido not know, lady, what you mean, but if I should take anyhurt by it, how much you would be to blame! Go, said she,go! I do not care; let me alone to say my prayers.

The said king chose at Paris a hun-dred fair, gallant, lusty, brisk young men, all resolute andbold adventurers in Cupid’s duels, together with a hundredcomely, pretty, handsome, lovely and well-complexionedwenches of Picardy, all which he caused to be well enter-tained and highly fed for the space of eight days. Then hav-ing called for them, he delivered to every one of the youngmen his wench, with store of money to defray their charges,and this injunction besides, to go unto divers places hereand there. And wheresoever they should biscot and thrumtheir wenches, that, they setting a stone there, it should beaccounted for a league. Thus went away those brave fellowsand sprightly blades most merrily, and because they werefresh and had been at rest, they very often jummed andfanfreluched almost at every field’s end, and this is the causewhy the leagues about Paris are so short. But when they hadgone a great way, and were now as weary as poor devils, allthe oil in their lamps being almost spent, they did not chinkand duffle so often, but contented themselves (I mean forthe men’s part) with one scurvy paltry bout in a day, and thisis that which makes the leagues in Brittany, Delanes, Ger-many, and other more remote countries so long.

Wondering at this,he called Panurge to him, and showed him the case. Where-upon Panurge told him that the leaf of paper was writtenupon, but with such cunning and artifice that no man couldsee the writing at the first sight. Therefore, to find it out, heset it by the fire to see if it was made with sal ammoniacsoaked in water. Then put he it into the water, to see if theletter was written with the juice of tithymalle. After that heheld it up against the candle, to see if it was written with thejuice of white onions.Then he rubbed one part of it with oil of nuts, to see if itwere not written with the lee of a fig-tree, and another partof it with the milk of a woman giving suck to her eldestdaughter, to see if it was written with the blood of red toadsor green earth-frogs. Afterwards he rubbed one corner withthe ashes of a swallow’s nest, to see if it were not written withthe dew that is found within the herb alcakengy, called thewinter-cherry. He rubbed, after that, one end with ear-wax,to see if it were not written with the gall of a raven. Then didhe dip it into vinegar, to try if it was not written with thejuice of the garden spurge.

For, to know whetherthere be anything written upon this or no, I have made useof a good part of that which Master Francisco di Nianto, theTuscan, sets down, who hath written the manner of readingletters that do not appear; that which Zoroastes published,Peri grammaton acriton; and Calphurnius Bassus, De literisillegibilibus.

This, then, is the exposition of thatwhich the lady means, Diamant faux, that is, false lover, whyhast thou forsaken me? Which interpretation Pantagruel pres-ently understood, and withal remembering that at his de-parture he had not bid the lady farewell, he was very sorry,and would fain have returned to Paris to make his peacewith her. But Epistemon put him in mind of Aeneas’s depar-ture from Dido, and the saying of Heraclitus of Tarentum,That the ship being at anchor, when need requireth we mustcut the cable rather than lose time about untying of it,—andthat he should lay aside all other thoughts to succour thecity of his nativity, which was then in danger.

As he was rising up to go about it, he per-ceived under the side of a wood a fair great roebuck, whichwas come out of his fort, as I conceive, at the sight of Panurge’sfire. Him did he pursue and run after with as much vigourand swiftness as if it had been a bolt out of a crossbow, andcaught him in a moment; and whilst he was in his course hewith his hands took in the air four great bustards, seven bit-terns, six and twenty grey partridges, two and thirty red-legged ones, sixteen pheasants, nine woodcocks, nineteenherons, two and thirty cushats and ringdoves; and with hisfeet killed ten or twelve hares and rabbits, which were thenat relief and pretty big withal, eighteen rails in a knot to-gether, with fifteen young wild-boars, two little beavers, andthree great foxes. So, striking the kid with his falchion athwartthe head, he killed him, and, bearing him on his back, he inhis return took up his hares, rails, and young wild-boars,and, as far off as he could be heard, cried out and said,Panurge, my friend, vinegar, vinegar!

Then said Pantagruel,Would to God every one of you had two pairs of little an-them or sacring bells hanging at your chin, and that I had atmine the great clocks of Rennes, of Poictiers, of Tours, andof Cambray, to see what a peal they would ring with thewagging of our chaps. But, said Panurge, it were better wethought a little upon our business, and by what means wemight get the upper hand of our enemies. That is well re-membered, said Pantagruel. Therefore spoke he thus to theprisoner, My friend, tell us here the truth, and do not lie tous at all, if thou wouldst not be flayed alive, for it is I that eatthe little children. Relate unto us at full the order, the num-ber, and the strength of the army.

Yes, sir, said theprisoner; he is there in person, and we call him Anarchus,king of the Dipsodes, which is as much to say as thirstypeople, for you never saw men more thirsty, nor more will-ing to drink, and his tent is guarded by the giants.

And then Pantagruel, for an eternalmemorial, wrote this victorial ditton, as followeth:— Here was the prowess made apparent of Four brave and valiant champions of proof, Who, without any arms but wit, at once, Like Fabius, or the two Scipions, Burnt in a fire six hundred and threescore Crablice, strong rogues ne’er vanquished before.

Then were the reins and furch of a young hare, With salt and vinegar, displayed there, Of which to snatch a bit or two at once They all fell on like hungry scorpions.

Receive this tenet, then, without control, That vinegar of that meat is the soul.Then said Pantagruel, Come, my lads, let us begone! wehave stayed here too long about our victuals; for very seldomdoth it fall out that the greatest eaters do the most martialexploits. There is no shadow like that of flying colours, nosmoke like that of horses, no clattering like that of armour.At this Epistemon began to smile, and said, There is noshadow like that of the kitchen, no smoke like that of pasties,and no clattering like that of goblets.

How now! said Panurge, areyour farts so fertile and fruitful? By G—, here be brave fartedmen and fisgued women; let them be married together; theywill beget fine hornets and dorflies. So did Pantagruel, andcalled them pigmies. Those he sent to live in an island thereby,where since that time they are increased mightily. But thecranes make war with them continually, against which theydo most courageously defend themselves; for these little endsof men and dandiprats (whom in Scotland they callwhiphandles and knots of a tar-barrel) are commonly verytesty and choleric; the physical reason whereof is, becausetheir heart is near their spleen.At this same time Panurge took two drinking glasses thatwere there, both of one bigness, and filled them with waterup to the brim, and set one of them upon one stool and theother upon another, placing them about one foot from oneanother. Then he took the staff of a javelin, about five footand a half long, and put it upon the two glasses, so that thetwo ends of the staff did come just to the brims of the glasses.This done, he took a great stake or billet of wood, and saidto Pantagruel and to the rest, My masters, behold how easilywe shall have the victory over our enemies; for just as I shallbreak this staff here upon these glasses, without either break-ing or crazing of them, nay, which is more, without spillingone drop of the water that is within them, even so shall webreak the heads of our Dipsodes without receiving any of usany wound or loss in our person or goods. But, that you maynot think there is any witchcraft in this, hold! said he toEusthenes, strike upon the midst as hard as thou canst withthis log.

When the prisoner was comehe went unto the king and told him how there was a greatgiant come, called Pantagruel, who had overthrown and madeto be cruelly roasted all the six hundred and nine and fiftyhorsemen, and he alone escaped to bring the news. Besidesthat, he was charged by the said giant to tell him that thenext day, about noon, he must make a dinner ready for him,for at that hour he was resolved to set upon him. Then didhe give him that box wherein were those confitures. But assoon as he had swallowed down one spoonful of them, hewas taken with such a heat in the throat, together with anulceration in the flap of the top of the windpipe, that his tonguepeeled with it in such sort that, for all they could do unto him,he found no ease at all but by drinking only without cessa-tion; for as soon as ever he took the goblet from his head, histongue was on a fire, and therefore they did nothing but stillpour in wine into his throat with a funnel. Which when hiscaptains, bashaws, and guard of his body did see, they tastedof the same drugs to try whether they were so thirst-procuringand alterative or no. But it so befell them as it had done theirking, and they plied the flagon so well that the noise ranthroughout all the camp, how the prisoner was returned; thatthe next day they were to have an assault; that the king and hiscaptains did already prepare themselves for it, together withhis guards, and that with carousing lustily and quaffing as hardas they could. Every man, therefore, in the army began totipple, ply the pot, swill and guzzle it as fast as they could. Insum, they drunk so much, and so long, that they fell asleeplike pigs, all out of order throughout the whole camp.Let us now return to the good Pantagruel, and relate howhe carried himself in this business.

After they had whittled and curried the can prettyhandsomely, Panurge gave Pantagruel to eat some devilishdrugs compounded of lithotripton, which is a stone-dissolv-ing ingredient, nephrocatarticon, that purgeth the reins, themarmalade of quinces, called codiniac, a confection ofcantharides, which are green flies breeding on the tops ofolive-trees, and other kinds of diuretic or piss-procuringsimples. This done, Pantagruel said to Carpalin, Go into thecity, scrambling like a cat against the wall, as you can welldo, and tell them that now presently they come out andcharge their enemies as rudely as they can, and having saidso, come down, taking a lighted torch with you, wherewithyou shall set on fire all the tents and pavilions in the camp;then cry as loud as you are able with your great voice, andthen come away from thence.

Evenno less astonished than are monks at the ringing of the firstpeal to matins, which in Lusonnois is called rub-ballock.In the meantime Pantagruel began to sow the salt that hehad in his bark, and because they slept with an open gapingmouth, he filled all their throats with it, so that those poorwretches were by it made to cough like foxes. Ha, Pantagruel,how thou addest greater heat to the firebrand that is in us!Suddenly Pantagruel had will to piss, by means of the drugswhich Panurge had given him, and pissed amidst the campso well and so copiously that he drowned them all, and therewas a particular deluge ten leagues round about, of such con-siderable depth that the history saith, if his father’s great marehad been there, and pissed likewise, it would undoubtedlyhave been a more enormous deluge than that of Deucalion;for she did never piss but she made a river greater than iseither the Rhone or the Danube. Which those that were comeout of the city seeing, said, They are all cruelly slain; see howthe blood runs along.

ButPantagruel was very nimble, and had always a quick footand a quick eye, and therefore with his left foot did he stepback one pace, yet not so nimbly but that the blow, fallingupon the bark, broke it in four thousand four score and sixpieces, and threw all the rest of the salt about the ground.Pantagruel, seeing that, most gallantly displayed the vigourof his arms, and, according to the art of the axe, gave himwith the great end of his mast a homethrust a little above thebreast; then, bringing along the blow to the left side, with aslash struck him between the neck and shoulders. After that,advancing his right foot, he gave him a push upon thecouillons with the upper end of his said mast, wherewithbreaking the scuttle on the top thereof, he spilt three or fourpuncheons of wine that were left therein.Upon that Loupgarou thought that he had pierced his blad-der, and that the wine that came forth had been his urine.Pantagruel, being not content with this, would have doubledit by a side-blow; but Loupgarou, lifting up his mace, ad-vanced one step upon him, and with all his force would havedashed it upon Pantagruel, wherein, to speak to the truth,he so sprightfully carried himself, that, if God had notsuccoured the good Pantagruel, he had been cloven from thetop of his head to the bottom of his milt. But the blow glancedto the right side by the brisk nimbleness of Pantagruel, andhis mace sank into the ground above threescore and thirteenfoot, through a huge rock, out of which the fire did issuegreater than nine thousand and six tons. Pantagruel, seeinghim busy about plucking out his mace, which stuck in theground between the rocks, ran upon him, and would haveclean cut off his head, if by mischance his mast had not"},{"pageNumber":276,"pageContent":"276Gargantua & Pantagrueltouched a little against the stock of Loupgarou’s mace, whichwas enchanted, as we have said before. By this means hismast broke off about three handfuls above his hand, whereathe stood amazed like a bell-founder, and cried out, Ah,Panurge, where art thou? Panurge, seeing that, said to theking and the giants, By G—, they will hurt one another ifthey be not parted. But the giants were as merry as if theyhad been at a wedding. Then Carpalin would have risen fromthence to help his master; but one of the giants said untohim, By Golfarin, the nephew of Mahoom, if thou stir henceI will put thee in the bottom of my breeches instead of asuppository, which cannot choose but do me good. For inmy belly I am very costive, and cannot well cagar withoutgnashing my teeth and making many filthy faces. ThenPantagruel, thus destitute of a staff, took up the end of hismast, striking athwart and alongst upon the giant, but hedid him no more hurt than you would do with a fillip upona smith’s anvil. In the (mean) time Loupgarou was drawinghis mace out of the ground, and, having already plucked itout, was ready therewith to have struck Pantagruel, who,being very quick in turning, avoided all his blows in takingonly the defensive part in hand, until on a sudden he sawthat Loupgarou did threaten him with these words, saying,Now, villain, will not I fail to chop thee as small as mincedmeat, and keep thee henceforth from ever making any morepoor men athirst! For then, without any more ado, Pantagruelstruck him such a blow with his foot against the belly that hemade him fall backwards, his heels over his head, and draggedhim thus along at flay-buttock above a flight-shot. ThenLoupgarou cried out, bleeding at the throat, Mahoom,Mahoom, Mahoom! at which noise all the giants arose tosuccour him. But Panurge said unto them, Gentlemen, donot go, if will believe me, for our master is mad, and strikesathwart and alongst, he cares not where; he will do you amischief. But the giants made no account of it, seeing thatPantagruel had never a staff.And when Pantagruel saw those giants approach very nearunto him, he took Loupgarou by the two feet, and lift up hisbody like a pike in the air, wherewith, it being harnessedwith anvils, he laid such heavy load amongst those giantsarmed with free-stone, that, striking them down as a masondoth little knobs of stones, there was not one of them that"},{"pageNumber":277,"pageContent":"277Rabelaisstood before him whom he threw not flat to the ground.And by the breaking of this stony armour there was madesuch a horrible rumble as put me in mind of the fall of thebutter-tower of St. Stephen’s at Bourges when it melted be-fore the sun. Panurge, with Carpalin and Eusthenes, did cutin the mean time the throats of those that were struck down,in such sort that there escaped not one. Pantagruel to anyman’s sight was like a mower, who with his scythe, whichwas Loupgarou, cut down the meadow grass, to wit, the gi-ants; but with this fencing of Pantagruel’s Loupgarou losthis head, which happened when Pantagruel struck down onewhose name was Riflandouille, or Pudding-plunderer, whowas armed cap-a-pie with Grison stones, one chip whereofsplintering abroad cut off Epistemon’s neck clean and fair.For otherwise the most part of them were but lightly armedwith a kind of sandy brittle stone, and the rest with slates. Atlast, when he saw that they were all dead, he threw the bodyof Loupgarou as hard as he could against the city, where fall-ing like a frog upon his belly in the great Piazza thereof, hewith the said fall killed a singed he-cat, a wet she-cat, a fartingduck, and a bridled goose.Chapter 2.XXX.Chapter 2.XXX.Chapter 2.XXX.Chapter 2.XXX.Chapter 2.XXX.HHHHHooooow Ew Ew Ew Ew Epistemon, who had his head cut offpistemon, who had his head cut offpistemon, who had his head cut offpistemon, who had his head cut offpistemon, who had his head cut off, was finely, was finely, was finely, was finely, was finelyhealed bhealed bhealed bhealed bhealed by Py Py Py Py Panurge, and of the neanurge, and of the neanurge, and of the neanurge, and of the neanurge, and of the news which he brws which he brws which he brws which he brws which he broughtoughtoughtoughtoughtfrfrfrfrfrom the devils, and of the damned people in hell.om the devils, and of the damned people in hell.om the devils, and of the damned people in hell.om the devils, and of the damned people in hell.om the devils, and of the damned people in hell.This gigantal victory being ended, Pantagruel withdrew him-self to the place of the flagons, and called for Panurge andthe rest, who came unto him safe and sound, exceptEusthenes, whom one of the giants had scratched a little inthe face whilst he was about the cutting of his throat, andEpistemon, who appeared not at all. Whereat Pantagruel wasso aggrieved that he would have killed himself. But Panurgesaid unto him, Nay, sir, stay a while, and we will search forhim amongst the dead, and find out the truth of all. Thus asthey went seeking after him, they found him stark dead, withhis head between his arms all bloody. Then Eusthenes criedout, Ah, cruel death! hast thou taken from me the perfectestamongst men?

But Panurge an-swered, My dear bullies all, weep not one drop more, for, hebeing yet all hot, I will make him as sound as ever he was. Insaying this, he took the head and held it warm foregainst hiscodpiece, that the wind might not enter into it. Eusthenesand Carpalin carried the body to the place where they hadbanqueted, not out of any hope that ever he would recover,but that Pantagruel might see it.Nevertheless Panurge gave him very good comfort, saying,If I do not heal him, I will be content to lose my head, whichis a fool’s wager. Leave off, therefore, crying, and help me.Then cleansed he his neck very well with pure white wine,and, after that, took his head, and into it synapised somepowder of diamerdis, which he always carried about him inone of his bags. Afterwards he anointed it with I know notwhat ointment, and set it on very just, vein against vein,sinew against sinew, and spondyle against spondyle, that hemight not be wry-necked—for such people he mortally hated.This done, he gave it round about some fifteen or sixteenstitches with a needle that it might not fall off again; then,on all sides and everywhere, he put a little ointment on it,which he called resuscitative.Suddenly Epistemon began to breathe, then opened hiseyes, yawned, sneezed, and afterwards let a great householdfart. Whereupon Panurge said, Now, certainly, he is healed,—and therefore gave him to drink a large full glass of strongwhite wine, with a sugared toast. In this fashion wasEpistemon finely healed, only that he was somewhat hoarsefor above three weeks together, and had a dry cough of whichhe could not be rid but by the force of continual drinking.And now he began to speak, and said that he had seen thedevil, had spoken with Lucifer familiarly, and had been verymerry in hell and in the Elysian fields, affirming very seri-ously before them all that the devils were boon companionsand merry fellows. But, in respect of the damned, he said hewas very sorry that Panurge had so soon called him backinto this world again; for, said he, I took wonderful delightto see them. How so? said Pantagruel.

Cyrus was exceeding glad to have met with sucha booty; but the other poor rogues, the kings that are therebelow, as Alexander, Darius, and others, stole it away fromhim by night. I saw Pathelin, the treasurer of Rhadamanthus,who, in cheapening the pudding-pies that Pope Julius cried,asked him how much a dozen. Three blanks, said the Pope.Nay, said Pathelin, three blows with a cudgel. Lay them downhere, you rascal, and go fetch more.

Nevertheless, of all this labour, toil, andmisery, they reckon nothing, so cursedly active they are in theprosecution of that their base calling, in hopes, at the end ofthe year, to earn some scurvy penny by it.Come, said Pantagruel, let us now make ourselves merryone bout, and drink, my lads, I beseech you, for it is verygood drinking all this month. Then did they uncase their flag-ons by heaps and dozens, and with their leaguer-provision madeexcellent good cheer.

And for their drink they had a kind ofsmall well-watered wine, and some sorbapple-cider. And, tomake them dance, he hired a blind man that made music tothem with a wind-broach.After dinner he led them to the palace and showed themto Pantagruel, and said, pointing to the married woman, Youneed not fear that she will crack.

Do not you see,said Panurge, that the chestnuts which are roasted in thefire, if they be whole they crack as if they were mad, and, tokeep them from cracking, they make an incision in themand slit them?

For therethey hire men by the day to sleep, and they get by it sixpencea day, but they that can snort hard get at least ninepence.How I had been robbed in the valley I informed the sena-tors, who told me that, in very truth, the people of that sidewere bad livers and naturally thievish, whereby I perceivedwell that, as we have with us the countries Cisalpine andTransalpine, that is, behither and beyond the mountains, sohave they there the countries Cidentine and Tradentine, thatis, behither and beyond the teeth. But it is far better livingon this side, and the air is purer. Then I began to think thatit is very true which is commonly said, that the one half ofthe world knoweth not how the other half liveth; seeing nonebefore myself had ever written of that country, wherein areabove five-and-twenty kingdoms inhabited, besides deserts,and a great arm of the sea. Concerning which purpose I havecomposed a great book, entitled, The History of the Throttias,because they dwell in the throat of my master Pantagruel.At last I was willing to return, and, passing by his beard, Icast myself upon his shoulders, and from thence slid downto the ground, and fell before him. As soon as I was per-ceived by him, he asked me, Whence comest thou, Alcofribas?I answered him, Out of your mouth, my lord. And how longhast thou been there? said he. Since the time, said I, that youwent against the Almirods. That is about six months ago,said he. And wherewith didst thou live? What didst thoudrink?

I let pass how for a minorative or gentlepotion he took four hundred pound weight of colophoniacscammony, six score and eighteen cartloads of cassia, an eleventhousand and nine hundred pound weight of rhubarb, be-sides other confuse jumblings of sundry drugs. You mustunderstand that by the advice of the physicians it was or-dained that what did offend his stomach should be takenaway; and therefore they made seventeen great balls of cop-per, each whereof was bigger than that which is to be seen onthe top of St. Peter’s needle at Rome, and in such sort thatthey did open in the midst and shut with a spring. Into oneof them entered one of his men carrying a lantern and atorch lighted, and so Pantagruel swallowed him down like alittle pill. Into seven others went seven country-fellows, hav-ing every one of them a shovel on his neck. Into nine othersentered nine wood-carriers, having each of them a baskethung at his neck, and so were they swallowed down like pills.When they were in his stomach, every one undid his spring,and came out of their cabins. The first whereof was he thatcarried the lantern, and so they fell more than half a leagueinto a most horrible gulf, more stinking and infectious thanever was Mephitis, or the marshes of the Camerina, or theabominably unsavoury lake of Sorbona, whereof Strabomaketh mention. And had it not been that they had verywell antidoted their stomach, heart, and wine-pot, which iscalled the noddle, they had been altogether suffocated andchoked with these detestable vapours. O what a perfume! Owhat an evaporation wherewith to bewray the masks or muf-flers of young mangy queans. After that, with groping andsmelling they came near to the faecal matter and the cor-rupted humours. Finally, they found a montjoy or heap ofordure and filth. Then fell the pioneers to work to dig it up,and the rest with their shovels filled the baskets; and whenall was cleansed every one retired himself into his ball.This done, Pantagruel enforcing himself to vomit, very eas-ily brought them out, and they made no more show in hismouth than a fart in yours.

Hearken now whilst I give you notice, to theend that you may not, like infidels, be by your simplicityabused, that in his time he was a rare philosopher and thecheerfullest of a thousand. If he had some imperfection, sohave you, so have we; for there is nothing, but God, that isperfect. Yet so it was, that by Alexander the Great, althoughhe had Aristotle for his instructor and domestic, was he heldin such estimation, that he wished, if he had not beenAlexander, to have been Diogenes the Sinopian.When Philip, King of Macedon, enterprised the siege andruin of Corinth, the Corinthians having received certain in-telligence by their spies that he with a numerous army inbattle-rank was coming against them, were all of them, notwithout cause, most terribly afraid; and therefore were notneglective of their duty in doing their best endeavours to putthemselves in a fit posture to resist his hostile approach anddefend their own city.Some from the fields brought into the fortified places theirmovables, bestial, corn, wine, fruit, victuals, and other nec-essary provision.Others did fortify and rampire their walls, set up little for-tresses, bastions, squared ravelins, digged trenches, cleansedcountermines, fenced themselves with gabions, contrivedplatforms, emptied casemates, barricaded the false brays,erected the cavaliers, repaired the counterscarps, plasteredthe curtains, lengthened ravelins, stopped parapets, morticedbarbacans, assured the portcullises, fastened the herses,sarasinesques, and cataracts, placed their sentries, and doubledtheir patrol.

They sharpened and preparedspears, staves, pikes, brown bills, halberds, long hooks, lances,zagayes, quarterstaves, eelspears, partisans, troutstaves, clubs,battle-axes, maces, darts, dartlets, glaives, javelins, javelots,and truncheons. They set edges upon scimitars, cutlasses,badelairs, backswords, tucks, rapiers, bayonets, arrow-heads,dags, daggers, mandousians, poniards, whinyards, knives,skeans, shables, chipping knives, and raillons.Every man exercised his weapon, every man scoured off therust from his natural hanger; nor was there a woman amongstthem, though never so reserved or old, who made not herharness to be well furbished; as you know the Corinthianwomen of old were reputed very courageous combatants.Diogenes seeing them all so warm at work, and himselfnot employed by the magistrates in any business whatsoever,he did very seriously, for many days together, without speak-ing one word, consider and contemplate the countenance ofhis fellow-citizens.Then on a sudden, as if he had been roused up and in-spired by a martial spirit, he girded his cloak scarfwise abouthis left arm, tucked up his sleeves to the elbow, trussed him-self like a clown gathering apples, and, giving to one of hisold acquaintance his wallet, books, and opistographs, awaywent he out of town towards a little hill or promontory ofCorinth called (the) Cranie; and there on the strand, a prettylevel place, did he roll his jolly tub, which served him for ahouse to shelter him from the injuries of the weather: there,I say, in a great vehemency of spirit, did he turn it, veer it,wheel it, whirl it, frisk it, jumble it, shuffle it, huddle it,tumble it, hurry it, jolt it, justle it, overthrow it, evert it,invert it, subvert it, overturn it, beat it, thwack it, bump it,batter it, knock it, thrust it, push it, jerk it, shock it, shake it,toss it, throw it, overthrow it, upside down, topsy-turvy,arsiturvy, tread it, trample it, stamp it, tap it, ting it, ring it,tingle it, towl it, sound it, resound it, stop it, shut it, unbungit, close it, unstopple it.

In my opinion, little honour is due to such as aremere lookers-on, liberal of their eyes, and of their crowns,and hide their silver; scratching their head with one fingerlike grumbling puppies, gaping at the flies like tithe calves;clapping down their ears like Arcadian asses at the melody ofmusicians, who with their very countenances in the depth ofsilence express their consent to the prosopopoeia.

Amongstthe diggers, pioneers, and rampire-builders, I will do as didNeptune and Apollo at Troy under Laomedon, or as didRenault of Montauban in his latter days: I will serve themasons, I’ll set on the pot to boil for the bricklayers; and,whilst the minced meat is making ready at the sound of mysmall pipe, I’ll measure the muzzle of the musing dotards.Thus did Amphion with the melody of his harp found, build,and finish the great and renowned city of Thebes.For the use of the warriors I am about to broach of newmy barrel to give them a taste (which by two former vol-umes of mine, if by the deceitfulness and falsehood of print-ers they had not been jumbled, marred, and spoiled, youwould have very well relished), and draw unto them, of thegrowth of our own trippery pastimes, a gallant third part ofa gallon, and consequently a jolly cheerful quart ofPantagruelic sentences, which you may lawfully call, if youplease, Diogenical: and shall have me, seeing I cannot betheir fellow-soldier, for their faithful butler, refreshing andcheering, according to my little power, their return from thealarms of the enemy; as also for an indefatigable extoller oftheir martial exploits and glorious achievements.

He expected bythe show of these novelties to win the love of the people. Butwhat happened thereupon? At the production of the camelthey were all affrighted, and offended at the sight of the party-coloured man—some scoffed at him as a detestable monsterbrought forth by the error of nature; in a word, of the hopewhich he had to please these Egyptians, and by such meansto increase the affection which they naturally bore him, hewas altogether frustrate and disappointed; understanding fullyby their deportments that they took more pleasure and de-light in things that were proper, handsome, and perfect, thanin misshapen, monstrous, and ridiculous creatures. Sincewhich time he had both the slave and the camel in suchdislike, that very shortly thereafter, either through negligence,or for want of ordinary sustenance, they did exchange theirlife with death.This example putteth me in a suspense between hope andfear, misdoubting that, for the contentment which I aim at,I will but reap what shall be most distasteful to me: my cakewill be dough, and for my Venus I shall have but some de-formed puppy: instead of serving them, I shall but vex them,and offend them whom I purpose to exhilarate; resemblingin this dubious adventure Euclion’s cook, so renowned byPlautus in his Pot, and by Ausonius in his Griphon, and bydivers others; which cook, for having by his scraping discov-ered a treasure, had his hide well curried.

Fornature hath not to any other end created man, but to owe,borrow, and lend; no greater is the harmony amongst theheavenly spheres than that which shall be found in its well-ordered policy. The intention of the founder of this micro-cosm is, to have a soul therein to be entertained, which islodged there, as a guest with its host, (that) it may live therefor a while. Life consisteth in blood, blood is the seat of thesoul; therefore the chiefest work of the microcosm is, to bemaking blood continually.At this forge are exercised all the members of the body;none is exempted from labour, each operates apart, and dothits proper office. And such is their heirarchy, that perpetu-ally the one borrows from the other, the one lends the other,and the one is the other’s debtor. The stuff and matter con-venient, which nature giveth to be turned into blood, is breadand wine. All kind of nourishing victuals is understood to becomprehended in these two, and from hence in the Gothishtongue is called companage. To find out this meat and drink,to prepare and boil it, the hands are put to work, the feet dowalk and bear up the whole bulk of the corporal mass; theeyes guide and conduct all; the appetite in the orifice of thestomach, by means of (a) little sourish black humour, calledmelancholy, which is transmitted thereto from the milt, givethwarning to shut in the food. The tongue doth make the firstessay, and tastes it; the teeth do chew it, and the stomachdoth receive, digest, and chylify it. The mesaraic veins suckout of it what is good and fit, leaving behind the excrements,which are, through special conduits for that purpose, voidedby an expulsive faculty. Thereafter it is carried to the liver,where it being changed again, it by the virtue of that newtransmutation becomes blood. What joy, conjecture you, willthen be found amongst those officers when they see this rivu-let of gold, which is their sole restorative? No greater is thejoy of alchemists, when after long travail, toil, and expensethey see in their furnaces the transmutation.

The bottle of the gall subtracts from thence allthe superfluous choler; whence it is brought to another shopor work-house to be yet better purified and fined, that is, theheart, which by its agitation of diastolic and systolic mo-tions so neatly subtilizeth and inflames it, that in the rightside ventricle it is brought to perfection, and through theveins is sent to all the members. Each parcel of the bodydraws it then unto itself, and after its own fashion is cher-ished and alimented by it. Feet, hands, thighs, arms, eyes,ears, back, breast, yea, all; and then it is, that who beforewere lenders, now become debtors. The heart doth in its leftside ventricle so thinnify the blood, that it thereby obtainsthe name of spiritual; which being sent through the arteriesto all the members of the body, serveth to warm and win-now the other blood which runneth through the veins. Thelights never cease with its lappets and bellows to cool andrefresh it, in acknowledgment of which good the heart,through the arterial vein, imparts unto it the choicest of itsblood.

For frequently by a Homeric lottery have manyhit upon their destinies; as is testified in the person of Socrates,who, whilst he was in prison, hearing the recitation of thisverse of Homer, said of Achilles in the Ninth of the Iliads— We, the third day, to fertile Pthia came—thereby foresaw that on the third subsequent day he was todie. Of the truth whereof he assured Aeschines; as Plato, inCritone, Cicero, in Primo, de Divinatione, Diogenes Laertius,and others, have to the full recorded in their works. The likeis also witnessed by Opilius Macrinus, to whom, being de-sirous to know if he should be the Roman emperor, befell,by chance of lot, this sentence in the Eighth of the Iliads— Dotard, new warriors urge thee to be gone. Thy life decays, and old age weighs thee down.In fact, he, being then somewhat ancient, had hardly en-joyed the sovereignty of the empire for the space of fourteenmonths, when by Heliogabalus, then both young and strong,he was dispossessed thereof, thrust out of all, and killed.Brutus doth also bear witness of another experiment of thisnature, who willing, through this exploratory way by lot, tolearn what the event and issue should be of the Pharsalianbattle wherein he perished, he casually encountered on thisverse, said of Patroclus in the Sixteenth of the Iliads— Fate, and Latona’s son have shot me dead.And accordingly Apollo was the field-word in the dreadfulday of that fight. Divers notable things of old have likewisebeen foretold and known by casting of Virgilian lots; yea, inmatters of no less importance than the obtaining of the Ro-man empire, as it happened to Alexander Severus, who, try-ing his fortune at the said kind of lottery, did hit upon thisverse written in the Sixth of the Aeneids—"},{"pageNumber":333,"pageContent":"333Rabelais Tu regere imperio populos, Romane, memento.

The goddess, whom you shall notfind propitious nor favourable unto you, is Minerva, a mostredoubtable and dreadful virgin, a powerful and fulminat-ing goddess, an enemy to cuckolds and effeminate young-sters, to cuckold-makers and adulterers. The god is Jupiter, aterrible and thunder-striking god from heaven. And withalit is to be remarked, that, conform to the doctrine of theancient Etrurians, the manubes, for so did they call the dart-ing hurls or slinging casts of the Vulcanian thunderbolts, didonly appertain to her and to Jupiter her father capital. Thiswas verified in the conflagration of the ships of Ajax Oileus,nor doth this fulminating power belong to any other of theOlympic gods. Men, therefore, stand not in such fear of them.Moreover, I will tell you, and you may take it as extractedout of the profoundest mysteries of mythology, that, whenthe giants had enterprised the waging of a war against thepower of the celestial orbs, the gods at first did laugh at thoseattempts, and scorned such despicable enemies, who were,in their conceit, not strong enough to cope in feats of war-fare with their pages; but when they saw by the gigantinelabour the high hill Pelion set on lofty Ossa, and that themount Olympus was made shake to be erected on the top ofboth, then was it that Jupiter held a parliament, or generalconvention, wherein it was unanimously resolved upon andcondescended to by all the gods, that they should worthily"},{"pageNumber":338,"pageContent":"338Gargantua & Pantagrueland valiantly stand to their defence.

Calaber, Theocritus, Pliny,Athenaeus, and others, the soul doth oftentimes foresee whatis to come. How true this is, you may conceive by a veryvulgar and familiar example; as when you see that at such atime as suckling babes, well nourished, fed, and fostered withgood milk, sleep soundly and profoundly, the nurses in theinterim get leave to sport themselves, and are licentiated torecreate their fancies at what range to them shall seem mostfitting and expedient, their presence, sedulity, and attendanceon the cradle being, during all that space, held unnecessary.Even just so, when our body is at rest, that the concoction iseverywhere accomplished, and that, till it awake, it lacks fornothing, our soul delighteth to disport itself and is wellpleased in that frolic to take a review of its native country,which is the heavens, where it receiveth a most notable par-ticipation of its first beginning with an imbuement from itsdivine source, and in contemplation of that infinite and in-tellectual sphere, whereof the centre is everywhere, and thecircumference in no place of the universal world, to wit, God,according to the doctrine of Hermes Trismegistus, to whomno new thing happeneth, whom nothing that is past escapeth,and unto whom all things are alike present, remarketh notonly what is preterit and gone in the inferior course and agi-tation of sublunary matters, but withal taketh notice what isto come; then bringing a relation of those future events untothe body of the outward senses and exterior organs, it is di-vulged abroad unto the hearing of others. Whereupon theowner of that soul deserveth to be termed a vaticinator, or"},{"pageNumber":342,"pageContent":"342Gargantua & Pantagruelprophet. Nevertheless, the truth is, that the soul is seldomable to report those things in such sincerity as it hath seenthem, by reason of the imperfection and frailty of the corpo-real senses, which obstruct the effectuating of that office;even as the moon doth not communicate unto this earth ofours that light which she receiveth from the sun with so muchsplendour, heat, vigour, purity, and liveliness as it was givenher. Hence it is requisite for the better reading, explaining,and unfolding of these somniatory vaticinations and predic-tions of that nature, that a dexterous, learned, skilful, wise,industrious, expert, rational, and peremptory expounder orinterpreter be pitched upon, such a one as by the Greeks iscalled onirocrit, or oniropolist. For this cause Heraclitus waswont to say that nothing is by dreams revealed to us, thatnothing is by dreams concealed from us, and that only wethereby have a mystical signification and secret evidence ofthings to come, either for our own prosperous or unluckyfortune, or for the favourable or disastrous success of an-other. The sacred Scriptures testify no less, and profane his-tories assure us of it, in both which are exposed to our view athousand several kinds of strange adventures, which havebefallen pat according to the nature of the dream, and that aswell to the party dreamer as to others. The Atlantic people,and those that inhabit the (is)land of Thasos, one of theCyclades, are of this grand commodity deprived; for in theircountries none yet ever dreamed. Of this sort (were) Cleon ofDaulia, Thrasymedes, and in our days the learned FrenchmanVillanovanus, neither of all which knew what dreaming was.Fail not therefore to-morrow, when the jolly and fair Au-rora with her rosy fingers draweth aside the curtains of thenight to drive away the sable shades of darkness, to bendyour spirits wholly to the task of sleeping sound, and theretoapply yourself. In the meanwhile you must denude your mindof every human passion or affection, such as are love andhatred, fear and hope, for as of old the great vaticinator, mostfamous and renowned prophet Proteus, was not able in hisdisguise or transformation into fire, water, a tiger, a dragon,and other such like uncouth shapes and visors, to presageanything that was to come till he was restored to his ownfirst natural and kindly form; just so doth man; for, at hisreception of the art of divination and faculty of prognosti-cating future things, that part in him which is the most di-"},{"pageNumber":343,"pageContent":"343Rabelaisvine, to wit, the Nous, or Mens, must be calm, peaceable,untroubled, quiet, still, hushed, and not embusied or dis-tracted with foreign, soul-disturbing perturbations.

For if I sup not well, large, round, and amply,my sleeping is not worth a forked turnip. All the night longI then but doze and rave, and in my slumbering fits talk idlenonsense, my thoughts being in a dull brown study, and asdeep in their dumps as is my belly hollow.Not to sup, answered Pantagruel, were best for you, con-sidering the state of your complexion and healthy constitu-tion of your body. A certain very ancient prophet, namedAmphiaraus, wished such as had a mind by dreams to beimbued with any oracle, for four-and-twenty hours to tasteno victuals, and to abstain from wine three days together.Yet shall not you be put to such a sharp, hard, rigorous, andextreme sparing diet.

You may very well remember how my fatherGargantua (whom here for honour sake I name) hath oftentold us that the writings of abstinent, abstemious, and long-fasting hermits were every whit as saltless, dry, jejune, andinsipid as were their bodies when they did compose them. Itis a most difficult thing for the spirits to be in a good plight,serene and lively, when there is nothing in the body but akind of voidness and inanity; seeing the philosophers withthe physicians jointly affirm that the spirits which are styledanimal spring from, and have their constant practice in andthrough the arterial blood, refined and purified to the lifewithin the admirable net which, wonderfully framed, liethunder the ventricles and tunnels of the brain. He gave usalso the example of the philosopher who, when he thoughtmost seriously to have withdrawn himself unto a solitaryprivacy, for from the rustling clutterments of the tumultu-ous and confused world, the better to improve his theory, tocontrive, comment, and ratiocinate, was, notwithstandinghis uttermost endeavours to free himself from all untoward"},{"pageNumber":344,"pageContent":"344Gargantua & Pantagruelnoises, surrounded and environed about so with the barkingof curs, bawling of mastiffs, bleating of sheep, prating ofparrots, tattling of jackdaws, grunting of swine, girning ofboars, yelping of foxes, mewing of cats, cheeping of mice,squeaking of weasels, croaking of frogs, crowing of cocks,cackling of hens, calling of partridges, chanting of swans,chattering of jays, peeping of chickens, singing of larks, creak-ing of geese, chirping of swallows, clucking of moorfowls,cucking of cuckoos, bumbling of bees, rammage of hawks,chirming of linnets, croaking of ravens, screeching of owls,whicking of pigs, gushing of hogs, curring of pigeons, grum-bling of cushat-doves, howling of panthers, curkling of quails,chirping of sparrows, crackling of crows, nuzzing of camels,wheening of whelps, buzzing of dromedaries, mumbling ofrabbits, cricking of ferrets, humming of wasps, mioling oftigers, bruzzing of bears, sussing of kitlings, clamouring ofscarfs, whimpering of fulmarts, booing of buffaloes, warblingof nightingales, quavering of mavises, drintling of turkeys,coniating of storks, frantling of peacocks, clattering of mag-pies, murmuring of stock-doves, crouting of cormorants,cigling of locusts, charming of beagles, guarring of puppies,snarling of messens, rantling of rats, guerieting of apes,snuttering of monkeys, pioling of pelicans, quacking of ducks,yelling of wolves, roaring of lions, neighing of horses, cryingof elephants, hissing of serpents, and wailing of turtles, thathe was much more troubled than if he had been in the middleof the crowd at the fair of Fontenay or Niort.

There is no need at allof that, quoth Pantagruel; for, besides that it is a thing verysuperstitious, the cheat thereof hath been at large discoveredunto us in the writings of Serapion, Ascalonites, Antiphon,Philochorus, Artemon, and Fulgentius Planciades. I couldsay as much to you of the left shoulder of a crocodile, as alsoof a chameleon, without prejudice be it spoken to the creditwhich is due to the opinion of old Democritus; and likewiseof the stone of the Bactrians, called Eumetrides, and of theAmmonian horn; for so by the Aethiopians is termed a cer-tain precious stone, coloured like gold, and in the fashion,shape, form, and proportion of a ram’s horn, as the horn ofJupiter Ammon is reported to have been: they over and aboveassuredly affirming that the dreams of those who carry itabout them are no less veritable and infallible than the truthof the divine oracles.

That word, quoth Epistemon, in ancient times costvery much, and was dearly sold to the children of Jacob.Then said Panurge, I have been plunged into my dumps sodeeply, as if I had been lodged with Gaffer Noddy-cap.Dreamed indeed I have, and that right lustily; but I couldtake along with me no more thereof that I did goodly under-stand save only that I in my vision had a pretty, fair, young,gallant, handsome woman, who no less lovingly and kindlytreated and entertained me, hugged, cherished, cockered,dandled, and made much of me, as if I had been anotherneat dilly-darling minion, like Adonis. Never was man moreglad than I was then; my joy at that time was incomparable.She flattered me, tickled me, stroked me, groped me, frizzledme, curled me, kissed me, embraced me, laid her hands aboutmy neck, and now and then made jestingly pretty little hornsabove my forehead. I told her in the like disport, as I didplay the fool with her, that she should rather place and fixthem in a little below mine eyes, that I might see the betterwhat I should stick at with them; for, being so situated,Momus then would find no fault therewith, as he did oncewith the position of the horns of bulls. The wanton, toyinggirl, notwithstanding any remonstrance of mine to the con-trary, did always drive and thrust them further in; yet thereby,which to me seemed wonderful, she did not do me any hurtat all.

Therehave you a large platterful of dreams, make thereupon goodcheer, and, if you please, spare not to interpret them accord-ing to the understanding which you may have in them. Come,Carpalin, let us to breakfast. To my sense and meaning, quothPantagruel, if I have skill or knowledge in the art of divina-tion by dreams, your wife will not really, and to the outwardappearance of the world, plant or set horns, and stick themfast in your forehead, after a visible manner, as satyrs use towear and carry them; but she will be so far from preservingherself loyal in the discharge and observance of a conjugalduty, that, on the contrary, she will violate her plighted faith,break her marriage-oath, infringe all matrimonial ties, pros-titute her body to the dalliance of other men, and so makeyou a cuckold. This point is clearly and manifestly explainedand expounded by Artemidorus just as I have related it. Norwill there be any metamorphosis or transmutation made ofyou into a drum or tabor, but you will surely be as soundlybeaten as ever was tabor at a merry wedding. Nor yet willshe be changed into a chough, but will steal from you, chieflyin the night, as is the nature of that thievish bird. Herebymay you perceive your dreams to be in every jot conformand agreeable to the Virgilian lots. A cuckold you will be,beaten and robbed.

And hereinmay I very well submit my opinion to the judgment of learnedlawyers, presidents, counsellors, advocates, procurers, attor-neys, and other glossers and commentators on the venerablerubric, De frigidis et maleficiatis. You are, in truth, sir, as itseems to me (excuse my boldness if I have transgressed), in amost palpable and absurd error to attribute my horns tocuckoldry.

Speak some-what more correctly, I beseech you, lest she, being offended,furnish you with a pair of horns shapen by the pattern ofthose which she made for Actaeon. The goodly Bacchus alsocarries horns,—Pan, Jupiter Ammon, with a great many oth-ers. Are they all cuckolds? If Jove be a cuckold, Juno is awhore. This follows by the figure metalepsis: as to call a child,in the presence of his father and mother, a bastard, or whore’sson, is tacitly and underboard no less than if he had saidopenly the father is a cuckold and his wife a punk. Let ourdiscourse come nearer to the purpose.

Yea, quoth Panurge, the rea-son of that was because I had fasted too long. Flatter notyourself, quoth Pantagruel; all will go to ruin. Know for acertain truth, that every sleep that endeth with a starting,and leaves the person irksome, grieved, and fretting, dotheither signify a present evil, or otherwise presageth andportendeth a future imminent mishap. To signify an evil,that is to say, to show some sickness hardly curable, a kind ofpestilentious or malignant boil, botch, or sore, lying and lurk-ing hid, occult, and latent within the very centre of the body,which many times doth by the means of sleep, whose natureis to reinforce and strengthen the faculty and virtue of con-coction, being according to the theorems of physic to de-clare itself, and moves toward the outward superficies. Atthis sad stirring is the sleeper’s rest and ease disturbed andbroken, whereof the first feeling and stinging smartadmonisheth that he must patiently endure great pain andtrouble, and thereunto provide some remedy; as when wesay proverbially, to incense hornets, to move a stinkingpuddle, and to awake a sleeping lion, instead of these moreusual expressions, and of a more familiar and plain meaning,to provoke angry persons, to make a thing the worse by med-dling with it, and to irritate a testy choleric man when he isat quiet. On the other part, to presage or foretell an evil,especially in what concerneth the exploits of the soul in mat-ter of somnial divinations, is as much to say as that it givethus to understand that some dismal fortune or mischance isdestinated and prepared for us, which shortly will not fail tocome to pass. A clear and evident example hereof is to befound in the dream and dreadful awaking of Hecuba, as like-wise in that of Eurydice, the wife of Orpheus, neither ofwhich was (no) sooner finished, saith Ennius, but that in-continently thereafter they awaked in a start, and wereaffrighted horribly. Thereupon these accidents ensued:Hecuba had her husband Priamus, together with her chil-"},{"pageNumber":351,"pageContent":"351Rabelaisdren, slain before her eyes, and saw then the destruction ofher country; and Eurydice died speedily thereafter in a mostmiserable manner. Aeneas, dreaming that he spoke to Hec-tor a little after his decease, did on a sudden in a great startawake, and was afraid. Now hereupon did follow this event:Troy that same night was spoiled, sacked, and burnt. At an-other time the same Aeneas dreaming that he saw his famil-iar geniuses and penates, in a ghastly fright and astonish-ment awaked, of which terror and amazement the issue was,that the very next day subsequent, by a most horrible tem-pest on the sea, he was like to have perished and been castaway. Moreover, Turnus being prompted, instigated, andstirred up by the fantastic vision of an infernal fury to enterinto a bloody war against Aeneas, awaked in a start muchtroubled and disquieted in spirit; in sequel whereof, aftermany notable and famous routs, defeats, and discomfituresin open field, he came at last to be killed in a single combatby the said Aeneas. A thousand other instances I could af-ford, if it were needful, of this matter. Whilst I relate thesestories of Aeneas, remark the saying of Fabius Pictor, whofaithfully averred that nothing had at any time befallen unto,was done, or enterprised by him, whereof he preallably hadnot notice, and beforehand foreseen it to the full, by surepredictions altogether founded on the oracles of somnial divi-nation. To this there is no want of pregnant reasons, no morethan of examples. For if repose and rest in sleeping be a spe-cial gift and favour of the gods, as is maintained by the phi-losophers, and by the poet attested in these lines, Then sleep, that heavenly gift, came to refresh Of human labourers the wearied flesh;such a gift or benefit can never finish or terminate in wrathand indignation without portending some unlucky fate andmost disastrous fortune to ensue. Otherwise it were a moles-tation, and not an ease; a scourge, and not a gift; at least,(not) proceeding from the gods above, but from the infernaldevils our enemies, according to the common vulgar saying.Suppose the lord, father, or master of a family, sitting at avery sumptuous dinner, furnished with all manner of goodcheer, and having at his entry to the table his appetite sharpset upon his victuals, whereof there was great plenty, should"},{"pageNumber":352,"pageContent":"352Gargantua & Pantagruelbe seen rise in a start, and on a sudden fling out of his chair,abandoning his meat, frighted, appalled, and in a horrid ter-ror, who should not know the cause hereof would wonder,and be astonished exceedingly.

These holy religious fathers, by a cer-tain cabalistic institution of the ancients, not written, butcarefully by tradition conveyed from hand to hand, risingbetimes to go to morning prayers, were wont to flourish thattheir matutinal devotion with some certain notable preamblesbefore their entry into the church, viz., they dunged in thedungeries, pissed in the pisseries, spit in the spitteries, melo-diously coughed in the cougheries, and doted in their dotaries,that to the divine service they might not bring anything thatwas unclean or foul. These things thus done, they very zeal-ously made their repair to the Holy Chapel, for so was intheir canting language termed the convent kitchen, where theywith no small earnestness had care that the beef-pot should beput on the crook for the breakfast of the religious brothers ofour Lord and Saviour; and the fire they would kindle underthe pot themselves. Now, the matins consisting of nine les-sons, (it) it was so incumbent on them, that must have risenthe rather for the more expedite despatching of them all. Thesooner that they rose, the sharper was their appetite and thebarkings of their stomachs, and the gnawings increased in thelike proportion, and consequently made these godly men thricemore a-hungered and athirst than when their matins werehemmed over only with three lessons. The more betimes theyrose, by the said cabal, the sooner was the beef-pot put on; thelonger that the beef was on the fire, the better it was boiled;the more it boiled, it was the tenderer; the tenderer that it was,the less it troubled the teeth, delighted more the palate, lesscharged the stomach, and nourished our good religious menthe more substantially; which is the only end and prime in-tention of the first founders, as appears by this, that they eatnot to live, but live to eat, and in this world have nothing buttheir life.

What could it havecost him to hearken unto what the honest man had inventedand contrived for his good? What detriment, annoyance,damage, or loss could he have undergone to listen to thediscovery of that secret which the good fellow would havemost willingly revealed unto him? Nature, I am persuaded,did not without a cause frame our ears open, putting theretono gate at all, nor shutting them up with any manner ofenclosures, as she hath done unto the tongue, the eyes, andother such out-jetting parts of the body.

They are assleuthhounds in the infallibility of their scent, and in theirsayings no less sententious than the rubrics of the law. There-fore in my conceit it is not an improper kind of speech tocall them sage or wise women. In confirmation of whichopinion of mine, the customary style of my language alloweththem the denomination of presage women. The epithet ofsage is due unto them because they are surpassing dexterousin the knowledge of most things. And I give them the title ofpresage, for that they divinely foresee and certainly foretellfuture contingencies and events of things to come. Some-times I call them not maunettes, but monettes, from theirwholesome monitions. Whether it be so, ask Pythagoras,Socrates, Empedocles, and our master Ortuinus. I further-more praise and commend above the skies the ancient memo-rable institution of the pristine Germans, who ordained theresponses and documents of old women to be highly ex-tolled, most cordially reverenced, and prized at a rate in noth-ing inferior to the weight, test, and standard of the sanctu-ary. And as they were respectfully prudent in receiving ofthese sound advices, so by honouring and following themdid they prove no less fortunate in the happy success of alltheir endeavours.

They finding the ancientwoman at a corner of her own chimney, Epistemon said, Sheis indeed a true sibyl, and the lively portrait of one repre-sented by the (Greek) of Homer.

But, says Pantagruel, it were requisite that the dumbyou consult with be such as have been deaf from the hour oftheir nativity, and consequently dumb; for none can be solively, natural, and kindly dumb as he who never heard.How is it, quoth Panurge, that you conceive this matter? Ifyou apprehend it so, that never any spoke who had not be-fore heard the speech of others, I will from that antecedentbring you to infer very logically a most absurd and paradoxi-cal conclusion. But let it pass; I will not insist on it. You donot then believe what Herodotus wrote of two children, who,at the special command and appointment of Psammeticus,King of Egypt, having been kept in a petty country cottage,where they were nourished and entertained in a perpetualsilence, did at last, after a certain long space of time, pro-nounce this word Bec, which in the Phrygian languagesignifieth bread. Nothing less, quoth Pantagruel, do I be-lieve than that it is a mere abusing of our understandings togive credit to the words of those who say that there is anysuch thing as a natural language. All speeches have had theirprimary origin from the arbitrary institutions, accords, andagreements of nations in their respective condescendmentsto what should be noted and betokened by them.

I do not tell you this withouta cause; for Bartholus, Lib. 5. de Verb. Oblig., very seriouslyreporteth that even in his time there was in Eugubia onenamed Sir Nello de Gabrielis, who, although he by a sadmischance became altogether deaf, understood neverthelesseveryone that talked in the Italian dialect howsoever he ex-pressed himself; and that only by looking on his externalgestures, and casting an attentive eye upon the divers mo-tions of his lips and chaps. I have read, I remember also, in avery literate and eloquent author, that Tyridates, King of Ar-menia, in the days of Nero, made a voyage to Rome, wherehe was received with great honour and solemnity, and withall manner of pomp and magnificence. Yea, to the end theremight be a sempiternal amity and correspondence preservedbetwixt him and the Roman senate, there was no remark-able thing in the whole city which was not shown unto him.At his departure the emperor bestowed upon him many ampledonatives of an inestimable value; and besides, the more en-tirely to testify his affection towards him, heartily entreatedhim to be pleased to make choice of any whatsoever thing inRome was most agreeable to his fancy, with a promisejuramentally confirmed that he should not be refused of hisdemand. Thereupon, after a suitable return of thanks for aso gracious offer, he required a certain Jack-pudding whomhe had seen to act his part most egregiously upon the stage,and whose meaning, albeit he knew not what it was he hadspoken, he understood perfectly enough by the signs andgesticulations which he had made. And for this suit of his, inthat he asked nothing else, he gave this reason, that in theseveral wide and spacious dominions which were reducedunder the sway and authority of his sovereign government,there were sundry countries and nations much differing fromone another in language, with whom, whether he was tospeak unto them or give any answer to their requests, he wasalways necessitated to make use of divers sorts of truchmanand interpreters. Now with this man alone, sufficient forsupplying all their places, will that great inconveniency here-after be totally removed; seeing he is such a fine gesticulator,and in the practice of chirology an artist so complete, expert,"},{"pageNumber":369,"pageContent":"369Rabelaisand dexterous, that with his very fingers he doth speak. How-soever, you are to pitch upon such a dumb one as is deaf bynature and from his birth; to the end that his gestures andsigns may be the more vively and truly prophetic, and notcounterfeit by the intermixture of some adulterate lustre andaffectation. Yet whether this dumb person shall be of themale or female sex is in your option, lieth at your discretion,and altogether dependeth on your own election.I would more willingly, quoth Panurge, consult with andbe advised by a dumb woman, were it not that I am afraid oftwo things. The first is, that the greater part of women, what-ever be that they see, do always represent unto their fancies,think, and imagine, that it hath some relation to the sugaredentering of the goodly ithyphallos, and graffing in the cleftof the overturned tree the quickset imp of the pin of copula-tion. Whatever signs, shows, or gestures we shall make, orwhatever our behaviour, carriage, or demeanour shall hap-pen to be in their view and presence, they will interpret thewhole in reference to the act of androgynation and theculbutizing exercise, by which means we shall be abusivelydisappointed of our designs, in regard that she will take allour signs for nothing else but tokens and representations ofour desire to entice her unto the lists of a Cyprian combat orcatsenconny skirmish. Do you remember what happened atRome two hundred and threescore years after the founda-tion thereof? A young Roman gentleman encountering bychance, at the foot of Mount Celion, with a beautiful Latinlady named Verona, who from her very cradle upwards hadalways been both deaf and dumb, very civilly asked her, notwithout a chironomatic Italianizing of his demand, with vari-ous jectigation of his fingers and other gesticulations as yetcustomary amongst the speakers of that country, what sena-tors in her descent from the top of the hill she had met withgoing up thither. For you are to conceive that he, knowingno more of her deafness than dumbness, was ignorant ofboth. She in the meantime, who neither heard nor under-stood so much as one word of what he had said, straightimagined, by all that she could apprehend in the lovely ges-ture of his manual signs, that what he then required of herwas what herself had a great mind to, even that which a youngman doth naturally desire of a woman.

Whereupon, without any more ad-vertisement, or so much as the uttering of one word on ei-ther side, they fell to and bringuardized it lustily.The other cause of my being averse from consulting withdumb women is, that to our signs they would make no an-swer at all, but suddenly fall backwards in a divarication pos-ture, to intimate thereby unto us the reality of their consentto the supposed motion of our tacit demands. Or if theyshould chance to make any countersigns responsory to ourpropositions, they would prove so foolish, impertinent, andridiculous, that by them ourselves should easily judge theirthoughts to have no excursion beyond the duffling academy.You know very well how at Brignoles, when the religiousnun, Sister Fatbum, was made big with child by the youngStiffly-stand-to’t, her pregnancy came to be known, and shecited by the abbess, and, in a full convention of the convent,accused of incest. Her excuse was that she did not consentthereto, but that it was done by the violence and impetuousforce of the Friar Stiffly-stand-to’t. Hereto the abbess veryausterely replying, Thou naughty wicked girl, why didst thounot cry, A rape, a rape! then should all of us have run to thysuccour. Her answer was that the rape was committed in thedortour, where she durst not cry because it was a place ofsempiternal silence. But, quoth the abbess, thou roguishwench, why didst not thou then make some sign to thosethat were in the next chamber beside thee? To this she an-swered that with her buttocks she made a sign unto them asvigorously as she could, yet never one of them did so muchas offer to come to her help and assistance.

Then did he lifthigher up than before his said left hand, stretching out allthe five fingers thereof, and severing them as wide from oneanother as he possibly could get done. Here, says Pantagruel,doth he more amply and fully insinuate unto us, by the to-ken which he showeth forth of the quinary number, thatyou shall be married. Yea, that you shall not only be affi-anced, betrothed, wedded, and married, but that you shallfurthermore cohabit and live jollily and merrily with yourwife; for Pythagoras called five the nuptial number, which,together with marriage, signifieth the consummation ofmatrimony, because it is composed of a ternary, the first ofthe odd, and binary, the first of the even numbers, as of amale and female knit and united together. In very deed itwas the fashion of old in the city of Rome at marriage festi-vals to light five wax tapers; nor was it permitted to kindleany more at the magnific nuptials of the most potent andwealthy, nor yet any fewer at the penurious weddings of thepoorest and most abject of the world. Moreover, in timespast, the heathen or paynims implored the assistance of fivedeities, or of one helpful, at least, in five several good officesto those that were to be married. Of this sort were the nup-tial Jove, Juno, president of the feast, the fair Venus, Pitho,the goddess of eloquence and persuasion, and Diana, whoseaid and succour was required to the labour of child-bearing.Then shouted Panurge, O the gentle Goatsnose, I will givehim a farm near Cinais, and a windmill hard by Mirebalais!Hereupon the dumb fellow sneezeth with an impetuousvehemency and huge concussion of the spirits of the wholebody, withdrawing himself in so doing with a jerking turntowards the left hand.

The quite con-trary thereto is thereby implied and presaged if it be donetowards the left. You, quoth Panurge, do take always thematter at the worst, and continually, like another Davus,casteth in new disturbances and obstructions; nor ever yetdid I know this old paltry Terpsion worthy of citation but inpoints only of cosenage and imposture. Nevertheless, quothPantagruel, Cicero hath written I know not what to the samepurpose in his Second Book of Divination.Panurge then, turning himself towards Goatsnose, madethis sign unto him. He inverted his eyelids upwards, wrenchedhis jaws from the right to the left side, and drew forth histongue half out of his mouth. This done, he posited his lefthand wholly open, the mid-finger wholly excepted, whichwas perpendicularly placed upon the palm thereof, and set itjust in the room where his codpiece had been. Then did hekeep his right hand altogether shut up in a fist, save only thethumb, which he straight turned backwards directly underthe right armpit, and settled it afterwards on that most emi-nent part of the buttocks which the Arabs call the Al-Katim.Suddenly thereafter he made this interchange: he held hisright hand after the manner of the left, and posited it on theplace wherein his codpiece sometime was, and retaining hisleft hand in the form and fashion of the right, he placed itupon his Al-Katim. This altering of hands did he reiteratenine several times; at the last whereof he reseated his eyelidsinto their own first natural position. Then doing the likealso with his jaws and tongue, he did cast a squinting lookupon Goatsnose, diddering and shivering his chaps, as apesuse to do nowadays, and rabbits, whilst, almost starved withhunger, they are eating oats in the sheaf.Then was it that Goatsnose, lifting up into the air his righthand wholly open and displayed, put the thumb thereof,even close unto its first articulation, between the two thirdjoints of the middle and ring fingers, pressing about the saidthumb thereof very hard with them both, and, whilst theremanent joints were contracted and shrunk in towards thewrist, he stretched forth with as much straightness as he could"},{"pageNumber":374,"pageContent":"374Gargantua & Pantagruelthe fore and little fingers. That hand thus framed and dis-posed of he laid and posited upon Panurge’s navel, movingwithal continually the aforesaid thumb, and bearing up, sup-porting, or under-propping that hand upon the above-speci-fied fore and little fingers, as upon two legs. Thereafter didhe make in this posture his hand by little and little, and bydegrees and pauses, successively to mount from athwart thebelly to the stomach, from whence he made it to ascend tothe breast, even upwards to Panurge’s neck, still gainingground, till, having reached his chin, he had put within theconcave of his mouth his afore-mentioned thumb; thenfiercely brandishing the whole hand, which he made to ruband grate against his nose, he heaved it further up, and madethe fashion as if with the thumb thereof he would have putout his eyes. With this Panurge grew a little angry, and wentabout to withdraw and rid himself from this ruggedly unto-ward dumb devil. But Goatsnose in the meantime, prosecut-ing the intended purpose of his prognosticatory response,touched very rudely, with the above-mentioned shakingthumb, now his eyes, then his forehead, and after that theborders and corners of his cap. At last Panurge cried out,saying, Before God, master fool, if you do not let me alone,or that you will presume to vex me any more, you shall re-ceive from the best hand I have a mask wherewith to coveryour rascally scroundrel face, you paltry shitten varlet.

By God, da jurandi, I will feast you withflirts and raps on the snout, interlarded with a double row ofbobs and finger-fillipings! Then did he leave him in givinghim by way of salvo a volley of farts for his farewell.Goatsnose, perceiving Panurge thus to slip away from him,got before him, and, by mere strength enforcing him to stand,made this sign unto him. He let fall his right arm toward hisknee on the same side as low as he could, and, raising all thefingers of that hand into a close fist, passed his dexter thumbbetwixt the foremost and mid fingers thereto belonging.

All truths agreeand are consonant with one another. This dumb fellowprophesieth and foretelleth that you will be married, cuck-olded, beaten, and robbed.

I remember also thatAristophanes, in a certain comedy of his, calleth the old folksSibyls, (Greek). For as when, being upon a pier by the shore,we see afar off mariners, seafaring men, and other travellersalongst the curled waves of azure Thetis within their ships,we then consider them in silence only, and seldom proceedany further than to wish them a happy and prosperous ar-rival; but when they do approach near to haven, and cometo wet their keels within their harbour, then both with wordsand gestures we salute them, and heartily congratulate theiraccess safe to the port wherein we are ourselves.

First, give me thypurse; for besides that thy money is marked with crosses,and the cross is an enemy to charms, the same may befall tothee which not long ago happened to John Dodin, collectorof the excise of Coudray, at the ford of Vede, when the sol-diers broke the planks. This moneyed fellow, meeting at thevery brink of the bank of the ford with Friar Adam Crankcod,a Franciscan observantin of Mirebeau, promised him a newfrock, provided that in the transporting of him over the wa-ter he would bear him upon his neck and shoulders, afterthe manner of carrying dead goats; for he was a lusty, strong-limbed, sturdy rogue. The condition being agreed upon, FriarCrankcod trusseth himself up to his very ballocks, and layethupon his back, like a fair little Saint Christopher, the load ofthe said supplicant Dodin, and so carried him gaily and witha good will, as Aeneas bore his father Anchises through theconflagration of Troy, singing in the meanwhile a pretty Ave"},{"pageNumber":384,"pageContent":"384Gargantua & PantagruelMaris Stella. When they were in the very deepest place of allthe ford, a little above the master-wheel of the water-mill, heasked if he had any coin about him. Yes, quoth Dodin, awhole bagful; and that he needed not to mistrust his abilityin the performance of the promise which he had made untohim concerning a new frock. How! quoth Friar Crankcod,thou knowest well enough that by the express rules, canons,and injunctions of our order we are forbidden to carry on usany kind of money. Thou art truly unhappy, for having mademe in this point to commit a heinous trespass. Why didstthou not leave thy purse with the miller? Without fail thoushalt presently receive thy reward for it; and if ever hereafterI may but lay hold upon thee within the limits of our chan-cel at Mirebeau, thou shalt have the Miserere even to theVitulos. With this, suddenly discharging himself of his bur-den, he throws me down your Dodin headlong. Take ex-ample by this Dodin, my dear friend Friar John, to the endthat the devils may the better carry thee away at thine ownease. Give me thy purse. Carry no manner of cross uponthee. Therein lieth an evident and manifestly apparent dan-ger. For if you have any silver coined with a cross upon it,they will cast thee down headlong upon some rocks, as theeagles use to do with the tortoises for the breaking of theirshells, as the bald pate of the poet Aeschylus can sufficientlybear witness. Such a fall would hurt thee very sore, my sweetbully, and I would be sorry for it. Or otherwise they will letthee fall and tumble down into the high swollen waves ofsome capacious sea, I know not where; but, I warrant thee,far enough hence, as Icarus fell, which from thy name wouldafterwards get the denomination of the Funnelian Sea.Secondly, be out of debt. For the devils carry a great likingto those that are out of debt. I have sore felt the experiencethereof in mine own particular; for now the lecherous varletsare always wooing me, courting me, and making much ofme, which they never did when I was all to pieces.

Notwith-standing all the fright that you are in, quoth Friar John, Iwould not care so much as might possibly be expected Ishould, if I once had but my sword in my hand. Thou hastverily hit the nail on the head, quoth Panurge, and speakestlike a learned doctor, subtle and well-skilled in the art ofdevilry. At the time when I was a student in the University ofToulouse (Tolette), that same reverend father in the devil,Picatrix, rector of the diabological faculty, was wont to tellus that the devils did naturally fear the bright glancing ofswords as much as the splendour and light of the sun. Inconfirmation of the verity whereof he related this story, thatHercules, at his descent into hell to all the devils of thoseregions, did not by half so much terrify them with his cluband lion’s skin as afterwards Aeneas did with his clear shin-ing armour upon him, and his sword in his hand well-fur-bished and unrusted, by the aid, counsel, and assistance ofthe Sybilla Cumana. That was perhaps the reason why thesenior John Jacomo di Trivulcio, whilst he was a-dying atChartres, called for his cutlass, and died with a drawn swordin his hand, lying about him alongst and athwart around thebed and everywhere within his reach, like a stout, doughty,valorous and knight-like cavalier; by which resolute mannerof fence he scared away and put to flight all the devils thatwere then lying in wait for his soul at the passage of his death.When the Massorets and Cabalists are asked why it is thatnone of all the devils do at any time enter into the terrestrialparadise? their answer hath been, is, and will be still, thatthere is a cherubin standing at the gate thereof with a flame-like glistering sword in his hand. Although, to speak in thetrue diabological sense or phrase of Toledo, I must needsconfess and acknowledge that veritably the devils cannot bekilled or die by the stroke of a sword, I do nevertheless avowand maintain, according to the doctrine of the said diabology,that they may suffer a solution of continuity (as if with thyshable thou shouldst cut athwart the flame of a burning fire,or the gross opacous exhalations of a thick and obscuresmoke), and cry out like very devils at their sense and feelingof this dissolution, which in real deed I must aver and affirmis devilishly painful, smarting, and dolorous."},{"pageNumber":386,"pageContent":"386Gargantua & PantagruelWhen thou seest the impetuous shock of two armies, andvehement violence of the push in their horrid encounter withone another, dost thou think, Ballockasso, that so horrible anoise as is heard there proceedeth from the voice and shoutsof men, the dashing and jolting of harness, the clatteringand clashing of armies, the hacking and slashing of battle-axes, the justling and crashing of pikes, the bustling and break-ing of lances, the clamour and shrieks of the wounded, thesound and din of drums, the clangour and shrillness of trum-pets, the neighing and rushing in of horses, with the fearfulclaps and thundering of all sorts of guns, from the doublecannon to the pocket pistol inclusively? I cannot goodly denybut that in these various things which I have rehearsed theremay be somewhat occasionative of the huge yell andtintamarre of the two engaged bodies. But the most fearfuland tumultuous coil and stir, the terriblest and most boister-ous garboil and hurry, the chiefest rustling black santus ofall, and most principal hurlyburly springeth from the griev-ously plangorous howling and lowing of devils, who pell-mell, in a hand-over-head confusion, waiting for the poorsouls of the maimed and hurt soldiery, receive unawares somestrokes with swords, and so by those means suffer a solutionof and division in the continuity of their aerial and invisiblesubstances; as if some lackey, snatching at the lard-slices stuckin a piece of roast meat on the spit, should get from Mr.Greasyfist a good rap on the knuckles with a cudgel.

Epistemon, thereupon tak-ing the speech in hand, represented unto Panurge how theopen voice and common fame of the whole country did runupon no other discourse but the derision and mockery of hisnew disguise; wherefore his counsel unto him was that hewould in the first place be pleased to make use of a littlehellebore for the purging of his brain of that peccant humourwhich, through that extravagant and fantastic mummery ofhis, had furnished the people with a too just occasion offlouting and gibing, jeering and scoffing him, and that nexthe would resume his ordinary fashion of accoutrement, andgo apparelled as he was wont to do. I am, quoth Panurge,my dear gossip Epistemon, of a mind and resolution to marry,but am afraid of being a cuckold and to be unfortunate inmy wedlock. For this cause have I made a vow to young St.Francis—who at Plessis-les-Tours is much reverenced of allwomen, earnestly cried unto by them, and with great devo-tion, for he was the first founder of the confraternity of goodmen, whom they naturally covet, affect, and long for—towear spectacles in my cap, and to carry no codpiece in mybreeches, until the present inquietude and perturbation ofmy spirits be fully settled.Truly, quoth Epistemon, that is a pretty jolly vow of thir-teen to a dozen. It is a shame to you, and I wonder much atit, that you do not return unto yourself, and recall your sensesfrom this their wild swerving and straying abroad to thatrest and stillness which becomes a virtuous man.

Yet do notI know which of these two deserveth most to wear a greenand yellow hood with a hare’s ears tied to it, either the afore-said vainglorious champion, or that Enguerrant, who hav-ing forgot the art and manner of writing histories set downby the Samosatian philosopher, maketh a most tediously longnarrative and relation thereof. For, at the first reading of sucha profuse discourse, one would think it had been broachedfor the introducing of a story of great importance and mo-ment concerning the waging of some formidable war, or thenotable change and mutation of potent states and kingdoms;but, in conclusion, the world laugheth at the capricious cham-pion, at the Englishman who had affronted him, as also attheir scribbler Enguerrant, more drivelling at the mouth thana mustard pot. The jest and scorn thereof is not unlike tothat of the mountain of Horace, which by the poet was madeto cry out and lament most enormously as a woman in thepangs and labour of child-birth, at which deplorable andexorbitant cries and lamentations the whole neighbourhoodbeing assembled in expectation to see some marvellous mon-strous production, could at last perceive no other but thepaltry, ridiculous mouse.Your mousing, quoth Panurge, will not make me leave mymusing why folks should be so frumpishly disposed, seeing Iam certainly persuaded that some flout who merit to beflouted at; yet, as my vow imports, so will I do.

These now are gone;but although they were as yet in continuance and in the samepower, rule, and request that formerly they were, yet wouldnot I counsel you to be too credulous in putting any trust intheir responses. Too many folks have been deceived thereby.It stands furthermore upon record how Agrippina did chargethe fair Lollia with the crime of having interrogated the oracleof Apollo Clarius, to understand if she should be at any timemarried to the Emperor Claudius; for which cause she wasfirst banished, and thereafter put to a shameful and igno-minious death.But, saith Panurge, let us do better.

With this, casting an eyeupon Panurge’s right hand in all the parts thereof, he said,This rugged draught which I see here, just under the mountof Jove, was never yet but in the hand of a cuckold. After-wards, he with a white lead pen swiftly and hastily drew acertain number of diverse kinds of points, which by rules ofgeomancy he coupled and joined together; then said: Truthitself is not truer than that it is certain thou wilt be a cuckolda little after thy marriage. That being done, he asked ofPanurge the horoscope of his nativity, which was no soonerby Panurge tendered unto him, than that, erecting a figure,he very promptly and speedily formed and fashioned a com-plete fabric of the houses of heaven in all their parts, whereofwhen he had considered the situation and the aspects in theirtriplicities, he fetched a deep sigh, and said: I have clearlyenough already discovered unto you the fate of yourcuckoldry, which is unavoidable, you cannot escape it.

Butwhence comes this ciron-worm betwixt these two fingers?This Panurge said, putting the forefinger of his left handbetwixt the fore and mid finger of the right, which he thrustout towards Herr Trippa, holding them open after the man-ner of two horns, and shutting into his fist his thumb withthe other fingers. Then, in turning to Epistemon, he said:Lo here the true Olus of Martial, who addicted and devotedhimself wholly to the observing the miseries, crosses, and ca-lamities of others, whilst his own wife, in the interim, didkeep an open bawdy-house.

For their custom was,at their return from abroad, when they were by themselves inprivate, to take their eyes out of their head, from whence theywere as easily removable as a pair of spectacles from their nose,and to lay them up into a wooden slipper which for that pur-pose did hang behind the door of their lodging.Panurge had no sooner done speaking, when Herr Trippatook into his hand a tamarisk branch.

By the blood of a hog’s-pudding, till whenwouldst thou delay the acting of a husband’s part? Dost thounot know, and is it not daily told unto thee, that the end ofthe world approacheth? We are nearer it by three poles andhalf a fathom than we were two days ago. The Antichrist isalready born; at least it is so reported by many. The truth is,that hitherto the effects of his wrath have not reached fur-ther than to the scratching of his nurse and governesses.

He wassomewhat gorbellied, had a little shake in his head, and wasin effect unwieldy of his body. In his old age he took to wifethe Bailiff of Concordat’s daughter, young, fair, jolly, gal-lant, spruce, frisk, brisk, neat, feat, smirk, smug, compt,quaint, gay, fine, tricksy, trim, decent, proper, graceful, hand-some, beautiful, comely, and kind—a little too much—toher neighbours and acquaintance.Hereupon it fell out, after the expiring of a scantling ofweeks, that Master Carvel became as jealous as a tiger, andentered into a very profound suspicion that his new-marriedgixy did keep a-buttock-stirring with others. To prevent whichinconveniency he did tell her many tragical stories of thetotal ruin of several kingdoms by adultery; did read unto herthe legend of chaste wives; then made some lectures to her inthe praise of the choice virtue of pudicity, and did presenther with a book in commendation of conjugal fidelity;wherein the wickedness of all licentious women was odiouslydetested; and withal he gave her a chain enriched with pureoriental sapphires. Notwithstanding all this, he found heralways more and more inclined to the reception of herneighbour copes-mates, that day by day his jealousy increased.In sequel whereof, one night as he was lying by her, whilst inhis sleep the rambling fancies of the lecherous deportmentsof his wife did take up the cellules of his brain, he dreamtthat he encountered with the devil, to whom he had discov-ered to the full the buzzing of his head and suspicion that hiswife did tread her shoe awry. The devil, he thought, in thisperplexity did for his comfort give him a ring, and there-withal did kindly put it on his middle finger, saying, HansCarvel, I give thee this ring,—whilst thou carriest it uponthat finger, thy wife shall never carnally be known by anyother than thyself without thy special knowledge and con-sent.

By SaintPicot, answered Panurge, we never shall do any good thatway, I see it already. And you see yourself how the world isvilely abused, as when with a foxtail one claps another’s breechto cajole him. We give our souls to keep to the theologues,who for the greater part are heretics. Our bodies we committo the physicians, who never themselves take any physic. Andthen we entrust our goods to the lawyers, who never go tolaw against one another. You speak like a courtier, quothPantagruel. But the first point of your assertion is to be de-nied; for we daily see how good theologues make it theirchief business, their whole and sole employment, by theirdeeds, their words, and writings, to extirpate errors and her-esies out of the hearts of men, and in their stead profoundlyplant the true and lively faith. The second point you spokeof I commend; for, whereas the professors of the art of medi-cine give so good order to the prophylactic, or conservativepart of their faculty, in what concerneth their proper healths,that they stand in no need of making use of the other branch,which is the curative or therapeutic, by medicaments. As forthe third, I grant it to be true, for learned advocates andcounsellors at law are so much taken up with the affairs ofothers in their consultations, pleadings, and such-likepatrocinations of those who are their clients, that they haveno leisure to attend any controversies of their own.

Is it a blaspheming clause or reserve any way scan-dalous unto the world? Do not we thereby honour the LordGod Almighty, Creator, Protector, and Conserver of allthings?

In like manner, I say, To the rest. There-fore I beseech you, my good Master Rondibilis, should Imarry or not? By the raking pace of my mule, quothRondibilis, I know not what answer to make to this problemof yours.You say that you feel in you the pricking stings of sensual-ity, by which you are stirred up to venery. I find in our fac-ulty of medicine, and we have founded our opinion thereinupon the deliberate resolution and final decision of the an-cient Platonics, that carnal concupiscence is cooled andquelled five several ways.First, By the means of wine. I shall easily believe that, quothFriar John, for when I am well whittled with the juice of thegrape I care for nothing else, so I may sleep. When I say,quoth Rondibilis, that wine abateth lust, my meaning is,wine immoderately taken; for by intemperancy proceedingfrom the excessive drinking of strong liquor there is broughtupon the body of such a swill-down boozer a chillness in theblood, a slackening in the sinews, a dissipation of the gen-erative seed, a numbness and hebetation of the senses, with aperversive wryness and convulsion of the muscles—all whichare great lets and impediments to the act of generation. Henceit is that Bacchus, the god of bibbers, tipplers, and drunk-ards, is most commonly painted beardless and clad in a"},{"pageNumber":417,"pageContent":"417Rabelaiswoman’s habit, as a person altogether effeminate, or like alibbed eunuch. Wine, nevertheless, taken moderately,worketh quite contrary effects, as is implied by the old prov-erb, which saith that Venus takes cold when not accompa-nied with Ceres and Bacchus. This opinion is of great antiq-uity, as appeareth by the testimony of Diodorus the Sicilian,and confirmed by Pausanias, and universally held amongstthe Lampsacians, that Don Priapus was the son of Bacchusand Venus.Secondly, The fervency of lust is abated by certain drugs,plants, herbs, and roots, which make the taker cold,maleficiated, unfit for, and unable to perform the act of gen-eration; as hath been often experimented in the water-lily,heraclea, agnus castus, willow-twigs, hemp-stalks, woodbine,honeysuckle, tamarisk, chaste tree, mandrake, bennet,keckbugloss, the skin of a hippopotam, and many other such,which, by convenient doses proportioned to the peccanthumour and constitution of the patient, being duly and sea-sonably received within the body—what by their elemen-tary virtues on the one side and peculiar properties on theother—do either benumb, mortify, and beclumpse with coldthe prolific semence, or scatter and disperse the spirits whichought to have gone along with and conducted the sperm tothe places destined and appointed for its reception, or lastly,shut up, stop, and obstruct the ways, passages, and conduitsthrough which the seed should have been expelled, evacu-ated, and ejected. We have nevertheless of those ingredientswhich, being of a contrary operation, heat the blood, bendthe nerves, unite the spirits, quicken the senses, strengthenthe muscles, and thereby rouse up, provoke, excite, and en-able a man to the vigorous accomplishment of the feat ofamorous dalliance. I have no need of those, quoth Panurge,God be thanked, and you, my good master. Howsoever, Ipray you, take no exception or offence at these my words;for what I have said was not out of any illwill I did bear toyou, the Lord he knows.Thirdly, The ardour of lechery is very much subdued andmated by frequent labour and continual toiling. For by pain-ful exercises and laborious working so great a dissolution isbrought upon the whole body, that the blood, which runnethalongst the channels of the veins thereof for the nourish-ment and alimentation of each of its members, hath neither"},{"pageNumber":418,"pageContent":"418Gargantua & Pantagrueltime, leisure, nor power to afford the seminal resudation, orsuperfluity of the third concoction, which nature most care-fully reserves for the conservation of the individual, whosepreservation she more heedfully regardeth than the propagat-ing of the species and the multiplication of humankind.Whence it is that Diana is said to be chaste, because she isnever idle, but always busied about her hunting. For the samereason was a camp or leaguer of old called castrum, as if theywould have said castum; because the soldiers, wrestlers, run-ners, throwers of the bar, and other such-like athletic champi-ons as are usually seen in a military circumvallation, do inces-santly travail and turmoil, and are in a perpetual stir and agita-tion. To this purpose Hippocrates also writeth in his book, DeAere, Aqua et Locis, that in his time there were people in Scythiaas impotent as eunuchs in the discharge of a venerean exploit,because that without any cessation, pause, or respite they werenever from off horseback, or otherwise assiduously employedin some troublesome and molesting drudgery.On the other part, in opposition and repugnancy hereto,the philosophers say that idleness is the mother of luxury.When it was asked Ovid, Why Aegisthus became an adul-terer? he made no other answer but this, Because he was idle.Who were able to rid the world of loitering and laziness mighteasily frustrate and disappoint Cupid of all his designs, aims,engines, and devices, and so disable and appal him that hisbow, quiver, and darts should from thenceforth be a mereneedless load and burden to him, for that it could not thenlie in his power to strike or wound any of either sex with allthe arms he had. He is not, I believe, so expert an archer asthat he can hit the cranes flying in the air, or yet the youngstags skipping through the thickets, as the Parthians knewwell how to do; that is to say, people moiling, stirring andhurrying up and down, restless, and without repose. He musthave those hushed, still, quiet, lying at a stay, lither, and fullof ease, whom he is able, though his mother help him, totouch, much less to pierce with all his arrows. In confirma-tion hereof, Theophrastus, being asked on a time what kindof beast or thing he judged a toyish, wanton love to be? hemade answer, that it was a passion of idle and sluggish spir-its.

My dear friend, answered Rondibilis, as Hippocrates ona time was in the very nick of setting forwards from Langoto Polystilo to visit the philosopher Democritus, he wrote afamiliar letter to his friend Dionysius, wherein he desiredhim that he would, during the interval of his absence, carryhis wife to the house of her father and mother, who were anhonourable couple and of good repute; because I would nothave her at my home, said he, to make abode in solitude.Yet, notwithstanding this her residence beside her parents,do not fail, quoth he, with a most heedful care and circum-spection to pry into her ways, and to espy what places sheshall go to with her mother, and who those be that shallrepair unto her.

Thus women arebut women.When I say womankind, I speak of a sex so frail, so vari-able, so changeable, so fickle, inconstant, and imperfect, thatin my opinion Nature, under favour, nevertheless, of theprime honour and reverence which is due unto her, did in amanner mistake the road which she had traced formerly, andstray exceedingly from that excellence of providential judg-ment by the which she had created and formed all otherthings, when she built, framed, and made up the woman.And having thought upon it a hundred and five times, Iknow not what else to determine therein, save only that inthe devising, hammering, forging, and composing of thewoman she hath had a much tenderer regard, and by a greatdeal more respectful heed to the delightful consortship andsociable delectation of the man, than to the perfection andaccomplishment of the individual womanishness or mulieb-rity. The divine philosopher Plato was doubtful in what rankof living creatures to place and collocate them, whetheramongst the rational animals, by elevating them to an upperseat in the specifical classis of humanity, or with the irratio-nal, by degrading them to a lower bench on the oppositeside, of a brutal kind, and mere bestiality.

Therein sometimesare engendered certain humours so saltish, brackish, clammy,sharp, nipping, tearing, prickling, and most eagerly tickling,that by their stinging acrimony, rending nitrosity, figgingitch, wriggling mordicancy, and smarting salsitude (for thesaid member is altogether sinewy and of a most quick and"},{"pageNumber":424,"pageContent":"424Gargantua & Pantagruellively feeling), their whole body is shaken and ebrangled,their senses totally ravished and transported, the operationsof their judgment and understanding utterly confounded,and all disordinate passions and perturbations of the mindthoroughly and absolutely allowed, admitted, and approvedof; yea, in such sort that if nature had not been so favourableunto them as to have sprinkled their forehead with a littletincture of bashfulness and modesty, you should see them ina so frantic mood run mad after lechery, and hie apace upand down with haste and lust, in quest of and to fix somechamber-standard in their Paphian ground, that never didthe Proetides, Mimallonides, nor Lyaean Thyades deportthemselves in the time of their bacchanalian festivals moreshamelessly, or with a so affronted and brazen-facedimpudency; because this terrible animal is knit unto, andhath an union with all the chief and most principal parts ofthe body, as to anatomists is evident. Let it not here bethought strange that I should call it an animal, seeing thereinI do no otherwise than follow and adhere to the doctrine ofthe academic and peripatetic philosophers. For if a propermotion be a certain mark and infallible token of the life andanimation of the mover, as Aristotle writeth, and that anysuch thing as moveth of itself ought to be held animated andof a living nature, then assuredly Plato with very good rea-son did give it the denomination of an animal, for that heperceived and observed in it the proper and self-stirringmotions of suffocation, precipitation, corrugation, and ofindignation so extremely violent, that oftentimes by them istaken and removed from the woman all other sense andmoving whatsoever, as if she were in a swounding lipothymy,benumbing syncope, epileptic, apoplectic palsy, and true re-semblance of a pale-faced death.Furthermore, in the said member there is a manifest dis-cerning faculty of scents and odours very perceptible towomen, who feel it fly from what is rank and unsavoury,and follow fragrant and aromatic smells.

It falleth toyour turn to give an answer: Should Panurge, pray you, marry,yea or no? He should do both, quoth Trouillogan. What sayyou? asked Panurge. That which you have heard, answeredTrouillogan. What have I heard? replied Panurge. That whichI have said, replied Trouillogan. Ha, ha, ha! are we come tothat pass? quoth Panurge. Let it go nevertheless, I do notvalue it at a rush, seeing we can make no better of the game.But howsoever tell me, Should I marry or no? Neither theone nor the other, answered Trouillogan. The devil take me,quoth Panurge, if these odd answers do not make me dote,and may he snatch me presently away if I do understandyou. Stay awhile until I fasten these spectacles of mine onthis left ear, that I may hear you better. With this Pantagruelperceived at the door of the great hall, which was that daytheir dining-room, Gargantua’s little dog, whose name wasKyne; for so was Toby’s dog called, as is recorded. Then didhe say to these who were there present, Our king is not faroff,—let us all rise.That word was scarcely sooner uttered, than that Gargantuawith his royal presence graced that banqueting and statelyhall. Each of the guests arose to do their king that reverenceand duty which became them. After that Gargantua had mostaffably saluted all the gentlemen there present, he said, Goodfriends, I beg this favour of you, and therein you will verymuch oblige me, that you leave not the places where yousate nor quit the discourse you were upon. Let a chair bebrought hither unto this end of the table, and reach me acupful of the strongest and best wine you have, that I maydrink to all the company. You are, in faith, all welcome, gentle-men. Now let me know what talk you were about. To thisPantagruel answered that at the beginning of the second ser-vice Panurge had proposed a problematic theme, to wit,whether he should marry, or not marry? that FatherHippothadee and Doctor Rondibilis had already despatched"},{"pageNumber":435,"pageContent":"435Rabelaistheir resolutions thereupon; and that, just as his majesty wascoming in, the faithful Trouillogan in the delivery of his opin-ion hath thus far proceeded, that when Panurge askedwhether he ought to marry, yea or no? at first he made thisanswer, Both together. When this same question was againpropounded, his second answer was, Neither the one northe other. Panurge exclaimeth that those answers are full ofrepugnancies and contradictions, protesting that he under-stands them not, nor what it is that can be meant by them. IfI be not mistaken, quoth Gargantua, I understand it verywell. The answer is not unlike to that which was once madeby a philosopher in ancient times, who being interrogated ifhe had a woman whom they named him to his wife? I haveher, quoth he, but she hath not me,—possessing her, by herI am not possessed. Such another answer, quoth Pantagruel,was once made by a certain bouncing wench of Sparta, whobeing asked if at any time she had had to do with a man?No, quoth she, but sometimes men have had to do with me.Well then, quoth Rondibilis, let it be a neuter in physic, aswhen we say a body is neuter, when it is neither sick norhealthful, and a mean in philosophy; that, by an abnegationof both extremes, and this by the participation of the oneand of the other. Even as when lukewarm water is said to beboth hot and cold; or rather, as when time makes the parti-tion, and equally divides betwixt the two, a while in the one,another while as long in the other opposite extremity. Theholy Apostle, quoth Hippothadee, seemeth, as I conceive, tohave more clearly explained this point when he said, Thosethat are married, let them be as if they were not married; andthose that have wives, let them be as if they had no wives atall. I thus interpret, quoth Pantagruel, the having and nothaving of a wife. To have a wife is to have the use of her insuch a way as nature hath ordained, which is for the aid,society, and solace of man, and propagating of his race. Tohave no wife is not to be uxorious, play the coward, and belazy about her, and not for her sake to distain the lustre ofthat affection which man owes to God, or yet for her toleave those offices and duties which he owes unto his coun-try, unto his friends and kindred, or for her to abandon andforsake his precious studies, and other businesses of account,to wait still on her will, her beck, and her buttocks.

I miss my friend Bridlegoose. Wasnot he sent for?

Thecase is this.At Paris, in the roastmeat cookery of the Petit Chastelet,before the cookshop of one of the roastmeat sellers of thatlane, a certain hungry porter was eating his bread, after hehad by parcels kept it a while above the reek and steam of afat goose on the spit, turning at a great fire, and found it, sobesmoked with the vapour, to be savoury; which the cookobserving, took no notice, till after having ravined his pennyloaf, whereof no morsel had been unsmokified, he was aboutdecamping and going away. But, by your leave, as the fellowthought to have departed thence shot-free, the master-cooklaid hold upon him by the gorget, and demanded paymentfor the smoke of his roast meat. The porter answered, thathe had sustained no loss at all; that by what he had donethere was no diminution made of the flesh; that he had takennothing of his, and that therefore he was not indebted tohim in anything. As for the smoke in question, that, althoughhe had not been there, it would howsoever have been evapo-rated; besides, that before that time it had never been seennor heard that roastmeat smoke was sold upon the streets ofParis. The cook hereto replied, that he was not obliged norany way bound to feed and nourish for nought a porter whomhe had never seen before with the smoke of his roast meat,and thereupon swore that if he would not forthwith contentand satisfy him with present payment for the repast whichhe had thereby got, that he would take his crooked stavesfrom off his back; which, instead of having loads thereafterlaid upon them, should serve for fuel to his kitchen fires.Whilst he was going about so to do, and to have pulled themto him by one of the bottom rungs which he had caught inhis hand, the sturdy porter got out of his grip, drew forth theknotty cudgel, and stood to his own defence. The alterca-tion waxed hot in words, which moved the gaping hoidensof the sottish Parisians to run from all parts thereabouts, tosee what the issue would be of that babbling strife and con-tention. In the interim of this dispute, to very good purposeSeyny John, the fool and citizen of Paris, happened to bethere, whom the cook perceiving, said to the porter, Wiltthou refer and submit unto the noble Seyny John the deci-sion of the difference and controversy which is betwixt us?Yes, by the blood of a goose, answered the porter, I am con-"},{"pageNumber":446,"pageContent":"446Gargantua & Pantagrueltent. Seyny John the fool, finding that the cook and porterhad compromised the determination of their variance anddebate to the discretion of his award and arbitrament, afterthat the reasons on either side whereupon was grounded themutual fierceness of their brawling jar had been to the fulldisplayed and laid open before him, commanded the porterto draw out of the fob of his belt a piece or money, if he hadit. Whereupon the porter immediately without delay, in rev-erence to the authority of such a judicious umpire, put thetenth part of a silver Philip into his hand. This little PhilipSeyny John took; then set it on his left shoulder, to try byfeeling if it was of a sufficient weight. After that, laying it onthe palm of his hand, he made it ring and tingle, to under-stand by the ear if it was of a good alloy in the metal whereofit was composed. Thereafter he put it to the ball or apple ofhis left eye, to explore by the sight if it was well stamped andmarked; all which being done, in a profound silence of thewhole doltish people who were there spectators of this pag-eantry, to the great hope of the cook’s and despair of theporter’s prevalency in the suit that was in agitation, he fi-nally caused the porter to make it sound several times uponthe stall of the cook’s shop. Then with a presidential majestyholding his bauble sceptre-like in his hand, muffling his headwith a hood of marten skins, each side whereof had the re-semblance of an ape’s face sprucified up with ears of pastedpaper, and having about his neck a bucked ruff, raised, fur-rowed, and ridged with pointing sticks of the shape and fash-ion of small organ pipes, he first with all the force of hislungs coughed two or three times, and then with an audiblevoice pronounced this following sentence: The courtdeclareth that the porter who ate his bread at the smoke ofthe roast, hath civilly paid the cook with the sound of hismoney. And the said court ordaineth that everyone return tohis own home, and attend his proper business, without costand charges, and for a cause. This verdict, award, and arbit-rament of the Parisian fool did appear so equitable, yea, soadmirable to the aforesaid doctors, that they very muchdoubted if the matter had been brought before the sessionsfor justice of the said place, or that the judges of the Rota atRome had been umpires therein, or yet that the Areopagitesthemselves had been the deciders thereof, if by any one part,or all of them together, it had been so judicially sententiated"},{"pageNumber":447,"pageContent":"447Rabelaisand awarded.

All their debates were pacified by him; he put anend to their brabbling suits at law and wrangling differences.By his advice and counsels were accords and reconcilementsno less firmly made than if the verdict of a sovereign judgehad been interposed therein, although, in very deed, he wasno judge at all, but a right honest man, as you may wellconceive,—arg. in l. sed si unius. ff. de jure-jur. et de verbisobligatoriis l.continuus. There was not a hog killed withinthree parishes of him whereof he had not some part of thehaslet and puddings.

Remark what I say; for he never yet settled and com-pounded a difference betwixt any two at variance, but hestraight made the parties agreed and pacified to drink to-gether as a sure and infallible token and symbol of a perfectand completely well-cemented reconciliation, sign of a soundand sincere amity and proper mark of a new joy and glad-ness to follow thereupon,—Ut not. per (Doct.) ff. de peric.et com. rei vend. l.

Whereupon the Gascon, despairing of meeting withany antagonists, departed from thence, and laying himselfdown not far from the pavilions of the grand Christian cava-lier Crissie, fell fast asleep.

I have lost my money aswell as thou hast done; let us therefore go fight lustily to-gether, grapple and scuffle it to some purpose. Thou mayestlook and see that my tuck is no longer than thy rapier.

Thirdly, gentlemen, I must needs dis-play before you another case, which in equity and justicemaketh much for the advantage of Bridlegoose, to wit, thatthis one, sole, and single fault of his ought to be quite for-gotten, abolished, and swallowed up by that immense andvast ocean of just dooms and sentences which heretoforehe hath given and pronounced; his demeanours, for theseforty years and upwards that he hath been a judge, havingbeen so evenly balanced in the scales of uprightness, thatenvy itself till now could not have been so impudent as toaccuse and twit him with any act worthy of a check or rep-rehension; as, if a drop of the sea were thrown into theLoire, none could perceive or say that by this single dropthe whole river should be salt and brackish."},{"pageNumber":468,"pageContent":"468Gargantua & PantagruelTruly, it seemeth unto me, that in the whole series ofBridlegoose’s juridical decrees there hath been I know notwhat of extraordinary savouring of the unspeakable benig-nity of God, that all those his preceding sentences, awards,and judgments, have been confirmed and approved of byyourselves in this your own venerable and sovereign court.For it is usual, as you know well, with him whose ways areinscrutable, to manifest his own ineffable glory in bluntingthe perspicacy of the eyes of the wise, in weakening thestrength of potent oppressors, in depressing the pride of richextortioners, and in erecting, comforting, protecting, sup-porting, upholding, and shoring up the poor, feeble, humble,silly, and foolish ones of the earth.

A pretty long time thereafter it happened, as you knowthe affection of stepfathers and stepdams is very rare towardsthe children of the first fathers and mothers deceased, thatthis husband, with the help of his son Effege, secretly, wit-tingly, willingly, and treacherously murdered Abece.

She was apprehendedand carried before Cneius Dolabella, in whose presence she,without dissembling anything, confessed all that was laid toher charge; yet alleged that she had both right and reason onher side for the killing of them. Thus was the state of thequestion. He found the business so dubious and intricate,that he knew not what to determine therein, nor which ofthe parties to incline to. On the other hand, it was an ex-ecrable crime to cut off at once both her second husbandand her son. On the other hand, the cause of the murderseemed to be so natural, as to be grounded upon the law ofnations and the rational instinct of all the people of the world,seeing they two together had feloniously and murderouslydestroyed her first son; not that they had been in any man-ner of way wronged, outraged, or injured by him, but out ofan avaricious intent to possess his inheritance. In this doubt-ful quandary and uncertainty what to pitch upon, he sent tothe Areopagites then sitting at Athens to learn and obtaintheir advice and judgment.

Le Duchat has pointed out the mistake.—M.), cat-egorically to that which you wonder at, I must ingeniouslyconfess and avow that I cannot; yet, conjecturally to guess atthe reason of it, I would refer the cause of that marvellouslylong-continued happy success in the judiciary results of hisdefinitive sentences to the favourable aspect of the heavensand benignity of the intelligences; who, out of their love togoodness, after having contemplated the pure simplicity andsincere unfeignedness of Judge Bridlegoose in the acknowl-edgment of his inabilities, did regulate that for him by chancewhich by the profoundest act of his maturest deliberation hewas not able to reach unto. That, likewise, which possiblymade him to diffide in his own skill and capacity, notwith-standing his being an expert and understanding lawyer, foranything that I know to the contrary, was the knowledgeand experience which he had of the antinomies, contrarie-ties, antilogies, contradictions, traversings, and thwartingsof laws, customs, edicts, statutes, orders, and ordinances, inwhich dangerous opposition, equity and justice being struc-tured and founded on either of the opposite terms, and agap being thereby opened for the ushering in of injusticeand iniquity through the various interpretations of self-endedlawyers, being assuredly persuaded that the infernal calum-niator, who frequently transformeth himself into the like-ness of a messenger or angel of light, maketh use of thesecross glosses and expositions in the mouths and pens of hisministers and servants, the perverse advocates, bribing judges,law-monging attorneys, prevaricating counsellors, and othersuch-like law-wresting members of a court of justice, to turnby those means black to white, green to grey, and what isstraight to a crooked ply.

In doing whereof he didnot stray from the sense of Talmudists, who say that there isso little harm in that manner of searching the truth, that inthe anxiety and perplexedness of human wits God oftentimesmanifesteth the secret pleasure of his divine will.Furthermore, I will neither think nor say, nor can I be-lieve, that the unstraightness is so irregular, or the corrup-tion so evident, of those of the parliament of Mirelingois inMirelingues, before whom Bridlegoose was arraigned forprevarication, that they will maintain it to be a worse prac-tice to have the decision of a suit at law referred to the chanceand hazard of a throw of the dice, hab nab, or luck as it will,than to have it remitted to and passed by the determination ofthose whose hands are full of blood and hearts of wry affec-tions. Besides that, their principal direction in all law matterscomes to their hands from one Tribonian, a wicked, miscre-ant, barbarous, faithless and perfidious knave, so pernicious,unjust, avaricious, and perverse in his ways, that it was hisordinary custom to sell laws, edicts, declarations, constitutions,and ordinances, as at an outroop or putsale, to him who of-fered most for them.

Did not you take heed, quoth he, a little before heopened his mouth to speak, what a shogging, shaking, andwagging his head did keep? By the approved doctrine of theancient philosophers, the customary ceremonies of the mostexpert magicians, and the received opinions of the learnedestlawyers, such a brangling agitation and moving should by usall be judged to proceed from, and be quickened and susci-tated by the coming and inspiration of the prophetizing andfatidical spirit, which, entering briskly and on a sudden intoa shallow receptacle of a debile substance (for, as you know,and as the proverb shows it, a little head containeth not muchbrains), was the cause of that commotion. This is conformto what is avouched by the most skilful physicians, whenthey affirm that shakings and tremblings fall upon the mem-bers of a human body, partly because of the heaviness andviolent impetuosity of the burden and load that is carried,and, other part, by reason of the weakness and imbecilitythat is in the virtue of the bearing organ. A manifest examplewhereof appeareth in those who, fasting, are not able to carryto their head a great goblet full of wine without a tremblingand a shaking in the hand that holds it.

Lampridius also testifieth that the EmperorHeliogabalus, to acquire unto himself the reputation of asoothsayer, did, on several holy days of prime solemnnity, inthe presence of the fanatic rabble, make the head of his idolby some slight within the body thereof publicly to shake.Plautus, in his Asinaria, declareth likewise, that Saurias,whithersoever he walked, like one quite distracted of his witskept such a furious lolling and mad-like shaking of his head,that he commonly affrighted those who casually met withhim in his way. The said author in another place, showing areason why Charmides shook and brangled his head,assevered that he was transported and in an ecstasy. Catullusafter the same manner maketh mention, in his Berecynthiaand Atys, of the place wherein the Menades, Bacchicalwomen, she-priests of the Lyaean god, and demented proph-etesses, carrying ivy boughs in their hands, did shake theirheads. As in the like case, amongst the Galli, the gelded priestsof Cybele were wont to do in the celebrating of their festi-vals. Whence, too, according to the sense of the ancienttheologues, she herself has her denomination, for (Greek)signifieth to turn round, whirl about, shake the head, andplay the part of one that is wry-necked.Semblably Titus Livius writeth that, in the solemnizationtime of the Bacchanalian holidays at Rome, both men andwomen seemed to prophetize and vaticinate, because of anaffected kind of wagging of the head, shrugging of the shoul-ders, and jectigation of the whole body, which they usedthen most punctually. For the common voice of the philoso-phers, together with the opinion of the people, asserteth foran irrefragable truth that vaticination is seldom by the heav-ens bestowed on any without the concomitancy of a littlefrenzy and a head-shaking, not only when the said presagingvirtue is infused, but when the person also therewith inspireddeclareth and manifesteth it unto others. The learned lawyerJulian, being asked on a time if that slave might be trulyesteemed to be healthful and in a good plight who had notonly conversed with some furious, maniac, and enragedpeople, but in their company had also prophesied, yet with-out a noddle-shaking concussion, answered that, seeing therewas no head-wagging at the time of his predictions, he mightbe held for sound and compotent enough.

There-fore were I a mad fool if, being a fool, I should not holdmyself a fool. After the same manner of speaking, we mayaver the number of the mad and enraged folks to be infinite.Avicenna maketh no bones to assert that the several kinds ofmadness are infinite.

Pantagruel, being come thither, preparedand made ready for launching a fleet of ships, to the numberof those which Ajax of Salamine had of old equipped in con-voy of the Grecian soldiery against the Trojan state.

Its height is commonly of five or sixfoot. Yet sometimes it is of such a tall growth as doth surpassthe length of a lance, but that is only when it meeteth with asweet, easy, warm, wet, and well-soaked soil—as is the groundof the territory of Olone, and that of Rasea, near to Prenestein Sabinia—and that it want not for rain enough about theseason of the fishers’ holidays and the estival solstice. Thereare many trees whose height is by it very far exceeded, and youmight call it dendromalache by the authority of Theophrastus.The plant every year perisheth,—the tree neither in the trunk,root, bark, or boughs being durable.From the stalk of this Pantagruelian plant there issue forthseveral large and great branches, whose leaves have thrice asmuch length as breadth, always green, roughish, and ruggedlike the orcanet, or Spanish bugloss, hardish, slit round aboutlike unto a sickle, or as the saxifragum, betony, and finallyending as it were in the points of a Macedonian spear, or ofsuch a lancet as surgeons commonly make use of in theirphlebotomizing tiltings. The figure and shape of the leavesthereof is not much different from that of those of the ash-tree, or of agrimony; the herb itself being so like theEupatorian plant that many skilful herbalists have called itthe Domestic Eupator, and the Eupator the WildPantagruelion.

The first instruction which Pantagruelgave concerning it was to divest and despoil the stalk andstem thereof of all its flowers and seeds, to macerate andmortify it in pond, pool, or lake water, which is to be maderun a little for five days together (Properly—’lake water, whichis to be made stagnant, not current, for five days together.’—M.) if the season be dry and the water hot, or for full nine ortwelve days if the weather be cloudish and the water cold.Then must it be parched before the sun till it be drained ofits moisture. After this it is in the shadow, where the sunshines not, to be peeled and its rind pulled off. Then are thefibres and strings thereof to be parted, wherein, as we havealready said, consisteth its prime virtue, price, and efficacy,and severed from the woody part thereof, which is unprofit-able, and serveth hardly to any other use than to make aclear and glistering blaze, to kindle the fire, and for the play,pastime, and disport of little children, to blow up hogs’ blad-ders and make them rattle. Many times some use is madethereof by tippling sweet-lipped bibbers, who out of it framequills and pipes, through which they with their liquor-at-tractive breath suck up the new dainty wine from the bungof the barrel. Some modern Pantagruelists, to shun and avoidthat manual labour which such a separating and partitionalwork would of necessity require, employ certain cataracticinstruments, composed and formed after the same mannerthat the froward, pettish, and angry Juno did hold the fin-gers of both her hands interwovenly clenched together whenshe would have hindered the childbirth delivery of Alcmenaat the nativity of Hercules; and athwart those cataracts theybreak and bruise to very trash the woody parcels, thereby topreserve the better the fibres, which are the precious andexcellent parts.

I have already interpretedand exposed before you the denomination thereof. I findthat plants have their names given and bestowed upon themafter several ways. Some got the name of him who first foundthem out, knew them, sowed them, improved them by cul-ture, qualified them to tractability, and appropriated themto the uses and subserviences they were fit for, as theMercuriale from Mercury; Panacea from Panace, the daugh-ter of Aesculapius; Armois from Artemis, who is Diana;Eupatoria from the king Eupator; Telephion from Telephus;Euphorbium from Euphorbus, King Juba’s physician;Clymenos from Clymenus; Alcibiadium from Alcibiades;Gentiane from Gentius, King of Sclavonia, and so forth,through a great many other herbs or plants. Truly, in ancienttimes this prerogative of imposing the inventor’s name uponan herb found out by him was held in a so great account andestimation, that, as a controversy arose betwixt Neptune andPallas from which of them two that land should receive itsdenomination which had been equally found out by themboth together—though thereafter it was called and had theappellation of Athens, from Athene, which is Minerva—justso would Lynceus, King of Scythia, have treacherously slainthe young Triptolemus, whom Ceres had sent to show untomankind the invention of corn, which until then had beenutterly unknown, to the end that, after the murder of themessenger, whose death he made account to have kept se-cret, he might, by imposing, with the less suspicion of falsedealing, his own name upon the said found out seed, ac-quire unto himself an immortal honour and glory for havingbeen the inventor of a grain so profitable and necessary toand for the use of human life. For the wickedness of whichtreasonable attempt he was by Ceres transformed into thatwild beast which by some is called a lynx and by others anounce. Such also was the ambition of others upon the likeoccasion, as appeareth by that very sharp wars and of a longcontinuance have been made of old betwixt some residen-tiary kings in Cappadocia upon this only debate, of whosename a certain herb should have the appellation; by reasonof which difference, so troublesome and expensive to them"},{"pageNumber":492,"pageContent":"492Gargantua & Pantagruelall, it was by them called Polemonion, and by us for thesame cause termed Make-bate.Other herbs and plants there are which retain the namesof the countries from whence they were transported, as theMedian apples from Media, where they first grew; Punicapples from Punicia, that is to say, Carthage; Ligusticum,which we call lovage, from Liguria, the coast of Genoa; Rhu-barb from a flood in Barbary, as Ammianus attesteth, calledRu; Santonica from a region of that name; Fenugreek fromGreece; Gastanes from a country so called; Persicaria fromPersia; Sabine from a territory of that appellation; Staechasfrom the Staechad Islands; Spica Celtica from the land ofthe Celtic Gauls, and so throughout a great many other, whichwere tedious to enumerate. Some others, again, have obtainedtheir denominations by way of antiphrasis, or contrariety; asAbsinth, because it is contrary to (Greek), for it is bitter tothe taste in drinking; Holosteon, as if it were all bones, whilst,on the contrary, there is no frailer, tenderer, nor brittler herbin the whole production of nature than it.There are some other sorts of herbs which have got theirnames from their virtues and operations, as Aristolochia,because it helpeth women in childbirth; Lichen, for that itcureth the disease of that name; Mallow, because it mollifieth;Callithricum, because it maketh the hair of a bright colour;Alyssum, Ephemerum, Bechium, Nasturtium, Aneban (Hen-bane), and so forth through many more.Other some there are which have obtained their names fromthe admirable qualities that are found to be in them, asHeliotropium, which is the marigold, because it followeth thesun, so that at the sun rising it displayeth and spreads itselfout, at his ascending it mounteth, at his declining it waneth,and when he is set it is close shut; Adianton, because, althoughit grow near unto watery places, and albeit you should let it liein water a long time, it will nevertheless retain no moisturenor humidity; Hierachia, Eringium, and so throughout a greatmany more. There are also a great many herbs and plants whichhave retained the very same names of the men and womenwho have been metamorphosed and transformed in them, asfrom Daphne the laurel is called also Daphne; Myrrh fromMyrrha, the daughter of Cinarus; Pythis from Pythis; Cinara,which is the artichoke, from one of that name; Narcissus, withSaffron, Smilax, and divers others."},{"pageNumber":493,"pageContent":"493RabelaisMany herbs likewise have got their names of those thingswhich they seem to have some resemblance to; as Hippuris,because it hath the likeness of a horse’s tail; Alopecuris, be-cause it representeth in similitude the tail of a fox; Psyllion,from a flea which it resembleth; Delphinium, for that it islike a dolphin fish; Bugloss is so called because it is an herblike an ox’s tongue; Iris, so called because in its flowers ithath some resemblance of the rainbow; Myosota, because itis like the ear of a mouse; Coronopus, for that it is of thelikeness of a crow’s foot. A great many other such there are,which here to recite were needless. Furthermore, as there areherbs and plants which have had their names from those ofmen, so by a reciprocal denomination have the surnames ofmany families taken their origin from them, as the Fabii, afabis, beans; the Pisons, a pisis, peas; the Lentuli from len-tils; the Cicerons; a ciceribus, vel ciceris, a sort of pulse calledchickpease, and so forth. In some plants and herbs the re-semblance or likeness hath been taken from a higher markor object, as when we say Venus’ navel, Venus’ hair, Venus’tub, Jupiter’s beard, Jupiter’s eye, Mars’ blood, theHermodactyl or Mercury’s fingers, which are all of themnames of herbs, as there are a great many more of the likeappellation.

IfI had put within this bottle two pints, the one of wine andthe other of water, thoroughly and exactly mingled together,how would you unmix them? After what manner would yougo about to sever them, and separate the one liquor from theother, in such sort that you render me the water apart, freefrom the wine, and the wine also pure, without the inter-mixture of one drop of water, and both of them in the samemeasure, quantity, and taste that I had embottled them? Or,to state the question otherwise. If your carmen and mari-ners, entrusted for the provision of your houses with thebringing of a certain considerable number of tuns, puncheons,pipes, barrels, and hogsheads of Graves wine, or of the wineof Orleans, Beaune, and Mireveaux, should drink out thehalf, and afterwards with water fill up the other empty halvesof the vessels as full as before, as the Limosins use to do intheir carriages by wains and carts of the wines of Argentonand Sangaultier; after that, how would you part the waterfrom the wine, and purify them both in such a case? I under-stand you well enough. Your meaning is, that I must do itwith an ivy funnel. That is written, it is true, and the veritythereof explored by a thousand experiments; you have learnedto do this feat before, I see it. But those that have neverknown it, nor at any time have seen the like, would hardlybelieve that it were possible. Let us nevertheless proceed.But put the case, we were now living in the age of Sylla,Marius, Caesar, and other such Roman emperors, or that wewere in the time of our ancient Druids, whose custom wasto burn and calcine the dead bodies of their parents andlords, and that you had a mind to drink the ashes or cindersof your wives or fathers in the infused liquor of some goodwhite-wine, as Artemisia drunk the dust and ashes of herhusband Mausolus; or otherwise, that you did determine tohave them reserved in some fine urn or reliquary pot; howwould you save the ashes apart, and separate them from thoseother cinders and ashes into which the fuel of the funeraland bustuary fire hath been converted? Answer, if you can.By my figgins, I believe it will trouble you so to do.Well, I will despatch, and tell you that, if you take of thiscelestial Pantagruelion so much as is needful to cover thebody of the defunct, and after that you shall have enwrapped"},{"pageNumber":501,"pageContent":"501Rabelaisand bound therein as hard and closely as you can the corpseof the said deceased persons, and sewed up the folding-sheetwith thread of the same stuff, throw it into the fire, howgreat or ardent soever it be it matters not a straw, the firethrough this Pantagruelion will burn the body and reduce toashes the bones thereof, and the Pantagruelion shall be notonly not consumed nor burnt, but also shall neither lose oneatom of the ashes enclosed within it, nor receive one atom ofthe huge bustuary heap of ashes resulting from the blazingconflagration of things combustible laid round about it, butshall at last, when taken out of the fire, be fairer, whiter, andmuch cleaner than when you did put it in at first.

The Antenorides andVenetians term it Larege; which gave occasion to that castlein Piedmont to receive the denomination of Larignum, byputting Julius Caesar to a stand at his return from amongstthe Gauls.Julius Caesar commanded all the yeomen, boors, hinds,and other inhabitants in, near unto, and about the Alps andPiedmont, to bring all manner of victuals and provision foran army to those places which on the military road he hadappointed to receive them for the use of his marching sol-diery. To which ordinance all of them were obedient, saveonly those as were within the garrison of Larignum, who,trusting in the natural strength of the place, would not paytheir contribution. The emperor, purposing to chastise themfor their refusal, caused his whole army to march straighttowards that castle, before the gate whereof was erected atower built of huge big spars and rafters of the larch-tree,fast bound together with pins and pegs of the same wood,and interchangeably laid on one another, after the fashion of"},{"pageNumber":503,"pageContent":"503Rabelaisa pile or stack of timber, set up in the fabric thereof to suchan apt and convenient height that from the parapet abovethe portcullis they thought with stones and levers to beat offand drive away such as should approach thereto.When Caesar had understood that the chief defence ofthose within the castle did consist in stones and clubs, andthat it was not an easy matter to sling, hurl, dart, throw, orcast them so far as to hinder the approaches, he forthwithcommanded his men to throw great store of bavins, faggots,and fascines round about the castle, and when they had madethe heap of a competent height, to put them all in a fair fire;which was thereupon incontinently done. The fire put amidstthe faggots was so great and so high that it covered the wholecastle, that they might well imagine the tower would therebybe altogether burnt to dust, and demolished. Nevertheless,contrary to all their hopes and expectations, when the flameceased, and that the faggots were quite burnt and consumed,the tower appeared as whole, sound, and entire as ever. Cae-sar, after a serious consideration had thereof, commanded acompass to be taken without the distance of a stone castfrom the castle round about it there, with ditches and en-trenchments to form a blockade; which when the Larignansunderstood, they rendered themselves upon terms. And thenby a relation from them it was that Caesar learned the admi-rable nature and virtue of this wood, which of itself producethneither fire, flame, nor coal, and would, therefore, in regardof that rare quality of incombustibility, have been admittedinto this rank and degree of a true Pantagruelional plant;and that so much the rather, for that Pantagruel directedthat all the gates, doors, angiports, windows, gutters, fretticedand embowed ceilings, cans, (cants?) and other whatsoeverwooden furniture in the abbey of Theleme, should be allmateriated of this kind of timber.

Now, I fancy, there’s nothing less dif-ficult to attempt than the first method; for, in this blessedage, ’tis as easy to find a bully without courage, as a whorewithout beauty, or a writer without wit; though those quali-fications are so necessary in their respective professions. Themischief is, that you seldom allow any to rail besides your-selves, and cannot bear a pride which shocks your own. Asfor wheedling you into a liking of a work, I must confess itseems the safest way; but though flattery pleases you wellwhen it is particular, you hate it, as little concerning you,when it is general. Then we knights of the quill are a stiff-necked generation, who as seldom care to seem to doubt theworth of our writings, and their being liked, as we love toflatter more than one at a time; and had rather draw ourpens, and stand up for the beauty of our works (as somearrant fools use to do for that of their mistresses) to the lastdrop of our ink. And truly this submission, which some-times wheedles you into pity, as seldom decoys you into love,as the awkward cringing of an antiquated fop, as moneylessas he is ugly, affects an experienced fair one. Now we as littlevalue your pity as a lover his mistress’s, well satisfied that it isonly a less uncivil way of dismissing us. But what if neitherof these two ways will work upon you, of which doleful truthsome of our playwrights stand so many living monuments?Why, then, truly I think on no other way at present butblending the two into one; and, from this marriage of huffingand cringing, there will result a new kind of careless medley,which, perhaps, will work upon both sorts of readers, thosewho are to be hectored, and those whom we must creep to.At least, it is like to please by its novelty; and it will not bethe first monster that has pleased you when regular naturecould not do it.If uncommon worth, lively wit, and deep learning, woveinto wholesome satire, a bold, good, and vast design admira-bly pursued, truth set out in its true light, and a methodhow to arrive to its oracle, can recommend a work, I am surethis has enough to please any reasonable man. The threebooks published some time since, which are in a manner anentire work, were kindly received; yet, in the French, theycome far short of these two, which are also entire pieces; forthe satire is all general here, much more obvious, and conse-quently more entertaining.

I hope the re-marks I give now will not please less; for, as I have translatedthe work which they explain, I had more time to make them,though as little to write them. It would be needless to givehere a large account of my performance; for, after all, youreaders care no more for this or that apology, or pretence ofMr. Translator, if the version does not please you, than wedo for a blundering cook’s excuse after he has spoiled a gooddish in the dressing. Nor can the first pretend to much praise,besides that of giving his author’s sense in its full extent, andcopying his style, if it is to be copied; since he has no share inthe invention or disposition of what he translates. Yet therewas no small difficulty in doing Rabelais justice in that doublerespect; the obsolete words and turns of phrase, and darksubjects, often as darkly treated, make the sense hard to beunderstood even by a Frenchman, and it cannot be easy togive it the free easy air of an original; for even what seemsmost common talk in one language, is what is often the mostdifficult to be made so in another; and Horace’s thoughts ofcomedy may be well applied to this: Creditur, ex medio quia res arcessit, habere Sudoris minimum; sed habet commoedia tantum Plus oneris, quanto veniae minus.Far be it from me, for all this, to value myself upon hittingthe words of cant in which my drolling author is so luxuri-ant; for though such words have stood me in good stead, Iscarce can forbear thinking myself unhappy in having insen-sibly hoarded up so much gibberish and Billingsgate trash inmy memory; nor could I forbear asking of myself, as an Ital-ian cardinal said on another account, D’onde hai tu pigliatotante coglionerie?

Some indeed havedeservedly gained esteem by translating; yet not many conde-scend to translate, but such as cannot invent; though to dothe first well requires often as much genius as to do the latter.I wish, reader, thou mayest be as willing to do my authorjustice, as I have strove to do him right.

Who then will? some will cry. Nay, besidesthese, many societies that make a great figure in the worldare reflected on in this book; which caused Rabelais to studyto be dark, and even bedaub it with many loose expressions,that he might not be thought to have any other design thanto droll; in a manner bewraying his book that his enemiesmight not bite it. Truly, though now the riddle is expounded,I would advise those who read it not to reflect on the author,lest he be thought to have been beforehand with them, andthey be ranked among those who have nothing to show fortheir honesty but their money, nothing for their religion buttheir dissembling, or a fat benefice, nothing for their wit buttheir dressing, for their nobility but their title, for their gen-tility but their sword, for their courage but their huffing, fortheir preferment but their assurance, for their learning buttheir degrees, or for their gravity but their wrinkles or dul-ness. They had better laugh at one another here, as it is thecustom of the world. Laughing is of all professions; the mi-ser may hoard, the spendthrift squander, the politician plot,the lawyer wrangle, and the gamester cheat; still their maindesign is to be able to laugh at one another; and here theymay do it at a cheap and easy rate. After all, should this workfail to please the greater number of readers, I am sure it can-not miss being liked by those who are for witty mirth and achirping bottle; though not by those solid sots who seem tohave drudged all their youth long only that they might enjoythe sweet blessing of getting drunk every night in their oldage. But those men of sense and honour who love truth andthe good of mankind in general above all other things willundoubtedly countenance this work. I will not gravely insistupon its usefulness, having said enough of it in the preface(Motteux’ Preface to vol. I of Rabelais, ed. 1694.) to the firstpart. I will only add, that as Homer in his Odyssey makeshis hero wander ten years through most parts of the thenknown world, so Rabelais, in a three months’ voyage, makesPantagruel take a view of almost all sorts of people and pro-fessions; with this difference, however, between the ancientmythologist and the modern, that while the Odyssey hasbeen compared to a setting sun in respect to the Iliads,Rabelais’ last work, which is this Voyage to the Oracle of theBottle (by which he means truth) is justly thought his mas-"},{"pageNumber":509,"pageContent":"509Rabelaisterpiece, being wrote with more spirit, salt, and flame, thanthe first part of his works.

Those who accuse the French of being as spar-ing of their wit as lavish of their words will find an English-man in our author. I must confess indeed that my country-men and other southern nations temper the one with theother in a manner as they do their wine with water, oftenjust dashing the latter with a little of the first. Now here menlove to drink their wine pure; nay, sometimes it will not sat-isfy unless in its very quintessence, as in brandies; though anexcess of this betrays want of sobriety, as much as an excessof wit betrays a want of judgment. But I must conclude, lestI be justly taxed with wanting both. I will only add, that asevery language has its peculiar graces, seldom or never to beacquired by a foreigner, I cannot think I have given my au-thor those of the English in every place; but as none com-pelled me to write, I fear to ask a pardon which yet the gen-erous temper of this nation makes me hope to obtain. Albinus,a Roman, who had written in Greek, desired in his prefaceto be forgiven his faults of language; but Cato asked him inderision whether any had forced him to write in a tongue ofwhich he was not an absolute master. Lucullus wrote a his-tory in the same tongue, and said he had scattered some falseGreek in it to let the world know it was the work of a Ro-man. I will not say as much of my writings, in which I studyto be as little incorrect as the hurry of business and shortnessof time will permit; but I may better say, as Tully did of thehistory of his consulship, which he also had written in Greek,that what errors may be found in the diction are crept inagainst my intent. Indeed, Livius Andronicus and Terence,the one a Greek, the other a Carthaginian, wrote success-fully in Latin, and the latter is perhaps the most perfect modelof the purity and urbanity of that tongue; but I ought not tohope for the success of those great men. Yet am I ambitiousof being as subservient to the useful diversion of the inge-nious of this nation as I can, which I have endeavoured inthis work, with hopes to attempt some greater tasks if ever Iam happy enough to have more leisure.

Would you know why I’m thus, good people? I willeven give you a positive answer—Such is the Lord’s will,which I obey and revere; it being said in his word, in greatderision to the physician neglectful of his own health, Physi-cian, heal thyself.Galen had some knowledge of the Bible, and had con-"},{"pageNumber":515,"pageContent":"515Rabelaisversed with Christians of his time, as appears lib. II. De UsuPartium; lib. 2. De Differentiis Pulsuum, cap. 3, and ibid.lib. 3. cap. 2. and lib. De Rerum Affectibus (if it be Galen’s).Yet ’twas not for any such veneration of holy writ that hetook care of his own health. No, it was for fear of beingtwitted with the saying so well known among physicians: He boasts of healing poor and rich, Yet is himself all over itch.This made him boldly say, that he did not desire to be es-teemed a physician, if from his twenty-eighth year to his oldage he had not lived in perfect health, except someephemerous fevers, of which he soon rid himself; yet he wasnot naturally of the soundest temper, his stomach being evi-dently bad. Indeed, as he saith, lib. 5, De Sanitate tuenda,that physician will hardly be thought very careful of the healthof others who neglects his own. Asclepiades boasted yet morethan this; for he said that he had articled with fortune not tobe reputed a physician if he could be said to have been sicksince he began to practise physic to his latter age, which hereached, lusty in all his members and victorious over for-tune; till at last the old gentleman unluckily tumbled downfrom the top of a certain ill-propped and rotten staircase,and so there was an end of him.If by some disaster health is fled from your worships to theright or to the left, above or below, before or behind, withinor without, far or near, on this side or the other side, where-soever it be, may you presently, with the help of the Lord,meet with it. Having found it, may you immediately claimit, seize it, and secure it. The law allows it; the king wouldhave it so; nay, you have my advice for it. Neither more norless than the law-makers of old did fully empower a masterto claim and seize his runaway servant wherever he might befound. Odds-bodikins, is it not written and warranted bythe ancient customs of this noble, so rich, so flourishing realmof France, that the dead seizes the quick? See what has beendeclared very lately in that point by that learned, wise, cour-teous, humane and just civilian, Andrew Tiraqueau, one ofthe judges in the most honourable court of Parliament atParis. Health is our life, as Ariphron the Sicyonian wiselyhas it; without health life is not life, it is not living life:"},{"pageNumber":516,"pageContent":"516Gargantua & Pantagruel(Greek). Without health life is only a languishment and animage of death. Therefore, you that want your health, that isto say, that are dead, seize the quick; secure life to yourselves,that is to say, health.I have this hope in the Lord, that he will hear our suppli-cations, considering with what faith and zeal we pray, andthat he will grant this our wish because it is moderate andmean. Mediocrity was held by the ancient sages to be golden,that is to say, precious, praised by all men, and pleasing in allplaces. Read the sacred Bible, you will find the prayers ofthose who asked moderately were never unanswered. Forexample, little dapper Zaccheus, whose body and relics themonks of St. Garlick, near Orleans, boast of having, andnickname him St. Sylvanus; he only wished to see our blessedSaviour near Jerusalem. It was but a small request, and nomore than anybody then might pretend to. But alas! he wasbut low-built; and one of so diminutive a size, among thecrowd, could not so much as get a glimpse of him. Well thenhe struts, stands on tiptoes, bustles, and bestirs his stumps,shoves and makes way, and with much ado clambers up asycamore. Upon this, the Lord, who knew his sincere affec-tion, presented himself to his sight, and was not only seenby him, but heard also; nay, what is more, he came to hishouse and blessed his family.One of the sons of the prophets in Israel felling wouldnear the river Jordan, his hatchet forsook the helve and fellto the bottom of the river; so he prayed to have it again(’twas but a small request, mark ye me), and having a strongfaith, he did not throw the hatchet after the helve, as somespirits of contradiction say by way of scandalous blunder,but the helve after the hatchet, as you all properly have it.Presently two great miracles were seen: up springs the hatchetfrom the bottom of the water, and fixes itself to its old ac-quaintance the helve. Now had he wished to coach it toheaven in a fiery chariot like Elias, to multiply in seed likeAbraham, be as rich as Job, strong as Samson, and beautifulas Absalom, would he have obtained it, d’ye think? I’ troth,my friends, I question it very much.Now I talk of moderate wishes in point of hatchet (butharkee me, be sure you don’t forget when we ought to drink),I will tell you what is written among the apologues of wiseAesop the Frenchman.

It happened that he lost his hatchet. Now tell me whoever had more cause to be vexed than poor Tom? Alas, hiswhole estate and life depended on his hatchet; by his hatchethe earned many a fair penny of the best woodmongers orlog-merchants among whom he went a-jobbing; for want ofhis hatchet he was like to starve; and had death but met withhim six days after without a hatchet, the grim fiend wouldhave mowed him down in the twinkling of a bedstaff. In thissad case he began to be in a heavy taking, and called uponJupiter with the most eloquent prayers—for you know ne-cessity was the mother of eloquence. With the whites of hiseyes turned up towards heaven, down on his marrow-bones,his arms reared high, his fingers stretched wide, and his headbare, the poor wretch without ceasing was roaring out, byway of litany, at every repetition of his supplications, Myhatchet, Lord Jupiter, my hatchet! my hatchet! only myhatchet, O Jupiter, or money to buy another, and nothingelse! alas, my poor hatchet!Jupiter happened then to be holding a grand council aboutcertain urgent affairs, and old gammer Cybele was just giv-ing her opinion, or, if you would rather have it so, it wasyoung Phoebus the beau; but, in short, Tom’s outcries andlamentations were so loud that they were heard with no smallamazement at the council-board, by the whole consistory ofthe gods.

I am in a sad quandary about it, and for the heart’sblood of me cannot tell yet with whom of the two to side.Both seem to me notable fellows, and as true cods as everpissed. The one has rose-nobles, I say fine and weighty ones; theother would gladly have some too. The one knows something;the other’s no dunce. The one loves the better sort of men; theother’s beloved by ‘em. The one is an old cunning fox; the otherwith tongue and pen, tooth and nail, falls foul on the ancientorators and philosophers, and barks at them like a cur.What thinkest thou of it, say, thou bawdy Priapus? I havefound thy counsel just before now, et habet tua mentulamentem.King Jupiter, answered Priapus, standing up and taking offhis cowl, his snout uncased and reared up, fiery and stifflypropped, since you compare the one to a yelping snarling curand the other to sly Reynard the fox, my advice is, with sub-mission, that without fretting or puzzling your brains any fur-ther about ‘em, without any more ado, even serve ‘em both as,in the days of yore, you did the dog and the fox. How? askedJupiter; when? who were they? where was it? You have a rarememory, for aught I see! returned Priapus. This right wor-shipful father Bacchus, whom we have here nodding with hiscrimson phiz, to be revenged on the Thebans had got a fairyfox, who, whatever mischief he did, was never to be caught orwronged by any beast that wore a head.The noble Vulcan here present had framed a dog ofMonesian brass, and with long puffing and blowing put thespirit of life into him; he gave it to you, you gave it yourMiss Europa, Miss Europa gave it Minos, Minos gave itProcris, Procris gave it Cephalus.

Nowwho should happen to meet but these two? What do youthink they did? Dog by his destiny was to take fox, and foxby his fate was not to be taken.The case was brought before your council: you protestedthat you would not act against the fates; and the fates werecontradictory. In short, the end and result of the matter was,that to reconcile two contradictions was an impossibility innature. The very pang put you into a sweat; some drops ofwhich happening to light on the earth, produced what themortals call cauliflowers. All our noble consistory, for wantof a categorical resolution, were seized with such a horridthirst, that above seventy-eight hogsheads of nectar wereswilled down at that sitting. At last you took my advice, andtransmogrified them into stones; and immediately got rid ofyour perplexity, and a truce with thirst was proclaimedthrough this vast Olympus. This was the year of flabby cods,near Teumessus, between Thebes and Chalcis.After this manner, it is my opinion that you should petrifythis dog and this fox. The metamorphosis will not be incon-gruous; for they both bear the name of Peter. And because,according to the Limosin proverb, to make an oven’s mouththere must be three stones, you may associate them withMaster Peter du Coignet, whom you formerly petrified forthe same cause. Then those three dead pieces shall be put inan equilateral trigone somewhere in the great temple atParis—in the middle of the porch, if you will—there to per-form the office of extinguishers, and with their noses putout the lighted candles, torches, tapers, and flambeaux; since,while they lived, they still lighted, ballock-like, the fire offaction, division, ballock sects, and wrangling among thoseidle bearded boys, the students. And this will be an everlast-ing monument to show that those puny self-conceited ped-ants, ballock-framers, were rather contemned than con-demned by you. Dixi, I have said my say.You deal too kindly by them, said Jupiter, for aught I see,Monsieur Priapus. You do not use to be so kind to every-body, let me tell you; for as they seek to eternize their names,it would be much better for them to be thus changed intohard stones than to return to earth and putrefaction.

Now let usdespatch this bawling fellow below. You, Mercury, go seewho it is, and know what he wants. Mercury looked out atheaven’s trapdoor, through which, as I am told, they hearwhat is said here below. By the way, one might well enoughmistake it for the scuttle of a ship; though Icaromenippussaid it was like the mouth of a well. The light-heeled deitysaw that it was honest Tom, who asked for his lost hatchet;and accordingly he made his report to the synod. Marry,said Jupiter, we are finely helped up, as if we had now noth-ing else to do here but to restore lost hatchets. Well, he musthave it then for all this, for so ’tis written in the Book of Fate(do you hear?), as well as if it was worth the whole duchy ofMilan. The truth is, the fellow’s hatchet is as much to him asa kingdom to a king. Come, come, let no more words bescattered about it; let him have his hatchet again.Now, let us make an end of the difference betwixt theLevites and mole-catchers of Landerousse. Whereabouts werewe?

Thus he plods on, trudging over thefields, keeping a good countenance amongst his neighboursand fellow-parishioners, with one merry saying or other af-ter Patelin’s way. The next day, having put on a clean whitejacket, he takes on his back the two precious hatchets andcomes to Chinon, the famous city, noble city, ancient city,yea, the first city in the world, according to the judgmentand assertion of the most learned Massorets. At Chinon heturned his silver hatchet into fine testons, crown-pieces, andother white cash; his golden hatchet into fine angels, curiousducats, substantial ridders, spankers, and rose-nobles; thenwith them purchases a good number of farms, barns, houses,out-houses, thatched houses, stables, meadows, orchards,fields, vineyards, woods, arable lands, pastures, ponds, mills,gardens, nurseries, oxen, cows, sheep, goats, swine, hogs, asses,horses, hens, cocks, capons, chickens, geese, ganders, ducks,drakes, and a world of all other necessaries, and in a short timebecame the richest man in the country, nay, even richer thanthat limping scrape-good Maulevrier.

The number of ships were such as I described in thethird book, convoyed by a like number of triremes, men ofwar, galleons, and feluccas, well-rigged, caulked, and storedwith a good quantity of Pantagruelion.All the officers, droggermen, pilots, captains, mates, boat-swains, midshipmen, quartermasters, and sailors, met in theThalamege, Pantagruel’s principal flag-ship, which had inher stern for her ensign a huge large bottle, half silver wellpolished, the other half gold enamelled with carnation;whereby it was easy to guess that white and red were thecolours of the noble travellers, and that they went for theword of the Bottle.On the stern of the second was a lantern like those of theancients, industriously made with diaphanous stone, imply-ing that they were to pass by Lanternland. The third shiphad for her device a fine deep china ewer. The fourth, adouble-handed jar of gold, much like an ancient urn. Thefifth, a famous can made of sperm of emerald.

After the prayers wasmelodiously sung a psalm of the holy King David, which be-gins, When Israel went out of Egypt; and that being ended,tables were placed upon deck, and a feast speedily served up.The Thalassians, who had also borne a chorus in the psalm,caused store of belly-timber to be brought out of their houses.All drank to them; they drank to all; which was the cause thatnone of the whole company gave up what they had eaten, norwere sea-sick, with a pain at the head and stomach; whichinconveniency they could not so easily have prevented by drink-ing, for some time before, salt water, either alone or mixedwith wine; using quinces, citron peel, juice of pomegranates,sourish sweetmeats, fasting a long time, covering their stom-achs with paper, or following such other idle remedies as fool-ish physicians prescribe to those that go to sea.Having often renewed their tipplings, each mother’s sonretired on board his own ship, and set sail all so fast with amerry gale at south-east; to which point of the compass thechief pilot, James Brayer by name, had shaped his course, andfixed all things accordingly. For seeing that the Oracle of theHoly Bottle lay near Cathay, in the Upper India, his advice,and that of Xenomanes also, was not to steer the course whichthe Portuguese use, while sailing through the torrid zone, andCape Bona Speranza, at the south point of Africa, beyond theequinoctial line, and losing sight of the northern pole, theirguide, they make a prodigious long voyage; but rather to keepas near the parallel of the said India as possible, and to tack tothe westward of the said pole, so that winding under the north,they might find themselves in the latitude of the port of Olone,without coming nearer it for fear of being shut up in the fro-zen sea; whereas, following this canonical turn, by the saidparallel, they must have that on the right to the eastward, whichat their departure was on their left.This proved a much shorter cut; for without shipwreck,danger, or loss of men, with uninterrupted good weather,except one day near the island of the Macreons, they per-formed in less than four months the voyage of Upper India,which the Portuguese, with a thousand inconveniences and"},{"pageNumber":529,"pageContent":"529Rabelaisinnumerable dangers, can hardly complete in three years.And it is my opinion, with submission to better judgments,that this course was perhaps steered by those Indians whosailed to Germany, and were honourably received by the Kingof the Swedes, while Quintus Metellus Celer was proconsulof the Gauls; as Cornelius Nepos, Pomponius Mela, and Plinyafter them tell us.Chapter 4.II.Chapter 4.II.Chapter 4.II.Chapter 4.II.Chapter 4.II.HHHHHooooow Pw Pw Pw Pw Pantagrantagrantagrantagrantagruel bought many rarities in the island ofuel bought many rarities in the island ofuel bought many rarities in the island ofuel bought many rarities in the island ofuel bought many rarities in the island ofMMMMMedamothyedamothyedamothyedamothyedamothy.....That day and the two following they neither discovered landnor anything new; for they had formerly sailed that way: buton the fourth they made an island called Medamothy, of afine and delightful prospect, by reason of the vast number oflighthouses and high marble towers in its circuit, which isnot less than that of Canada (sic).

Pantagruel caused to be bought, by Gym-nast, the life and deeds of Achilles, in seventy-eight pieces oftapestry, four fathom long, and three fathom broad, all ofPhrygian silk, embossed with gold and silver; the work be-ginning at the nuptials of Peleus and Thetis, continuing tothe birth of Achilles; his youth, described by Statius Papinius;his warlike achievements, celebrated by Homer; his deathand obsequies, written by Ovid and Quintus Calaber; andending at the appearance of his ghost, and Polyxena’s sacri-fice, rehearsed by Euripides.He also caused to be bought three fine young unicorns;one of them a male of a chestnut colour, and two grey dappledfemales; also a tarand, whom he bought of a Scythian of theGelones’ country.A tarand is an animal as big as a bullock, having a headlike a stag, or a little bigger, two stately horns with largebranches, cloven feet, hair long like that of a furred Musco-vite, I mean a bear, and a skin almost as hard as steel armour.The Scythian said that there are but few tarands to be foundin Scythia, because it varieth its colour according to the di-versity of the places where it grazes and abides, and repre-sents the colour of the grass, plants, trees, shrubs, flowers,meadows, rocks, and generally of all things near which itcomes.

This Ican affirm, that I have seen it change its colour, not only atthe approach of things that have a colour, but by its ownvoluntary impulse, according to its fear or other affections;as, for example, upon a green carpet I have certainly seen itbecome green; but having remained there some time, it turnedyellow, blue, tanned, and purple in course, in the same man-"},{"pageNumber":531,"pageContent":"531Rabelaisner as you see a turkey-cock’s comb change colour accordingto its passions.

Pantagruel looked towards the haven, and per-ceived that this was occasioned by the arrival of one of hisfather Gargantua’s celoces, or advice-boats, named theChelidonia; because on the stern of it was carved inCorinthian brass a sea-swallow, which is a fish as large as adare-fish of Loire, all flesh, without scale, with cartilaginouswings (like a bat’s) very long and broad, by the means ofwhich I have seen them fly about three fathom above water,about a bow-shot. At Marseilles ’tis called lendole. And in-deed that ship was as light as a swallow, so that it ratherseemed to fly on the sea than to sail. Malicorne, Gargantua’sesquire carver, was come in her, being sent expressly by hismaster to have an account of his son’s health and circum-stances, and to bring him credentials. When Malicorne hadsaluted Pantagruel, before the prince opened the letters, thefirst thing he said to him was, Have you here the Gozal, theheavenly messenger?

The pigeon presently flew away,cutting the air with an incredible speed, as you know thatthere is no flight like a pigeon’s, especially when it hath eggsor young ones, through the extreme care which nature hathfixed in it to relieve and be with its young; insomuch that inless than two hours it compassed in the air the long tractwhich the advice-boat, with all her diligence, with oars andsails, and a fair wind, could not go through in less than threedays and three nights; and was seen as it went into the dove-house in its nest. Whereupon Gargantua, hearing that it hadthe white ribbon on, was joyful and secure of his son’s wel-fare. This was the custom of the noble Gargantua andPantagruel when they would have speedy news of somethingof great concern; as the event of some battle, either by sea orland; the surrendering or holding out of some strong place;the determination of some difference of moment; the safe orunhappy delivery of some queen or great lady; the death orrecovery of their sick friends or allies, and so forth. Theyused to take the gozal, and had it carried from one to an-other by the post, to the places whence they desired to havenews.

But hark you me, if you were a scholar, you shouldknow that in the most inferior members of those animals,which are the feet, there is a bone, which is the heel, theastragalus, if you will have it so, wherewith, and with that ofno other creature breathing, except the Indian ass and thedorcades of Libya, they used in old times to play at the royalgame of dice, whereat Augustus the emperor won above fiftythousand crowns one evening.

On the third day, at theflies’ uprising (which, you know, is some two or three hoursafter the sun’s), we got sight of a triangular island, very muchlike Sicily for its form and situation. It was called the Islandof Alliances.The people there are much like your carrot-pated Poitevins,save only that all of them, men, women, and children, havetheir noses shaped like an ace of clubs. For that reason theancient name of the country was Ennasin. They were all akin,as the mayor of the place told us; at least they boasted so.You people of the other world esteem it a wonderful thingthat, out of the family of the Fabii at Rome, on a certain day,which was the 13th of February, at a certain gate, which wasthe Porta Carmentalis, since named Scelerata, formerly situ-ated at the foot of the Capitol, between the Tarpeian rockand the Tiber, marched out against the Veientes of Etruriathree hundred and six men bearing arms, all related to eachother, with five thousand other soldiers, every one of themtheir vassals, who were all slain near the river Cremera, thatcomes out of the lake of Beccano. Now from this same coun-try of Ennasin, in case of need, above three hundred thou-sand, all relations and of one family, might march out.

Those, said Friar John, must needs stink dam-nably of fish when they have rubbed their bacon one withthe other. One, smiling on a young buxom baggage, said,Good morrow, dear currycomb. She, to return him his civil-ity, said, The like to you, my steed. Ha! ha! ha! said Panurge,that is pretty well, in faith; for indeed it stands her in goodstead to currycomb this steed. Another greeted his buttockwith a Farewell, my case. She replied, Adieu, trial. By St.Winifred’s placket, cried Gymnast, this case has been oftentried. Another asked a she-friend of his, How is it, hatchet?She answered him, At your service, dear helve. Odds belly,saith Carpalin, this helve and this hatchet are well matched.As we went on, I saw one who, calling his she-relation, styledher my crumb, and she called him, my crust.Quoth one to a brisk, plump, juicy female, I am glad tosee you, dear tap. So am I to find you so merry, sweet spiggot,replied she. One called a wench, his shovel; she called him,her peal: one named his, my slipper; and she, my foot: an-other, my boot; she, my shasoon.In the same degree of kindred, one called his, my butter;she called him, my eggs; and they were akin just like a dishof buttered eggs. I heard one call his, my tripe, and she him,my faggot. Now I could not, for the heart’s blood of me,pick out or discover what parentage, alliance, affinity, or con-sanguinity was between them, with reference to our custom;only they told us that she was faggot’s tripe. (Tripe de fagotmeans the smallest sticks in a faggot.) Another,complimenting his convenient, said, Yours, my shell; she re-plied, I was yours before, sweet oyster. I reckon, said Carpalin,she hath gutted his oyster. Another long-shanked ugly rogue,mounted on a pair of high-heeled wooden slippers, meetinga strapping, fusty, squabbed dowdy, says he to her, How is’tmy top?

SaithPantagruel, This is not altogether incongruous, for sweet meatmust have sour sauce. A wooden loggerhead said to a youngwench, It is long since I saw you, bag; All the better, criedshe, pipe. Set them together, said Panurge, then blow in theirarses, it will be a bagpipe. We saw, after that, a diminutivehumpbacked gallant, pretty near us, taking leave of a she-relation of his, thus: Fare thee well, friend hole; she reparteed,Save thee, friend peg. Quoth Friar John, What could theysay more, were he all peg and she all hole? But now would Igive something to know if every cranny of the hole can bestopped up with that same peg.A bawdy bachelor, talking with an old trout, was saying,Remember, rusty gun. I will not fail, said she, scourer. Doyou reckon these two to be akin? said Pantagruel to the mayor.I rather take them to be foes. In our country a woman wouldtake this as a mortal affront. Good people of t’other world,replied the mayor, you have few such and so near relations asthis gun and scourer are to one another; for they both comeout of one shop. What, was the shop their mother? quothPanurge. What mother, said the mayor, does the man mean?That must be some of your world’s affinity; we have hereneither father nor mother. Your little paltry fellows that liveon t’other side the water, poor rogues, booted with wisps ofhay, may indeed have such; but we scorn it. The goodPantagruel stood gazing and listening; but at those words hehad like to have lost all patience (Here Motteux adds anaside—’(Greek). M.’).Having very exactly viewed the situation of the island andthe way of living of the Enassed nation, we went to take acup of the creature at a tavern, where there happened to be awedding after the manner of the country. Bating that shock-ing custom, there was special good cheer.While we were there, a pleasant match was struck up be-twixt a female called Pear (a tight thing, as we thought, butby some, who knew better things, said to be quaggy andflabby), and a young soft male, called Cheese, somewhat"},{"pageNumber":547,"pageContent":"547Rabelaissandy.

Besides, when the women are at their last prayers, it isto this day a noted saying, that after cheese comes nothing.In another room I saw them marrying an old greasy bootto a young pliable buskin. Pantagruel was told that youngbuskin took old boot to have and to hold because she was ofspecial leather, in good case, and waxed, seared, liquored,and greased to the purpose, even though it had been for thefisherman that went to bed with his boots on. In anotherroom below, I saw a young brogue taking a young slipper forbetter for worse; which, they told us, was neither for the sakeof her piety, parts, or person, but for the fourth comprehen-sive p, portion; the spankers, spur-royals, rose-nobles, andother coriander seed with which she was quilted all over.Chapter 4.X.Chapter 4.X.Chapter 4.X.Chapter 4.X.Chapter 4.X.HHHHHooooow Pw Pw Pw Pw Pantagrantagrantagrantagrantagruel wuel wuel wuel wuel went ashorent ashorent ashorent ashorent ashore at the island of Chelye at the island of Chelye at the island of Chelye at the island of Chelye at the island of Chely,,,,,wherwherwherwherwhere he saw King Se he saw King Se he saw King Se he saw King Se he saw King St. Pt.

Truly you put me in mind of some passages thathappened at Florence, some twenty years ago, in a companyof studious travellers, fond of visiting the learned, and see-ing the antiquities of Italy, among whom I was. As we viewedthe situation and beauty of Florence, the structure of thedome, the magnificence of the churches and palaces, we stroveto outdo one another in giving them their due; when a cer-tain monk of Amiens, Bernard Lardon by name, quite an-gry, scandalized, and out of all patience, told us, I don’t knowwhat the devil you can find in this same town, that is somuch cried up; for my part I have looked and pored andstared as well as the best of you; I think my eyesight is asclear as another body’s, and what can one see after all?

These ancient statues are well made; Iam willing to believe it; but, by St. Ferreol of Abbeville, wehave young wenches in our country which please me bettera thousand times.What is the reason, asked Friar John, that monks are al-ways to be found in kitchens, and kings, emperors, and popesare never there? Is there not, said Rhizotome, some latentvirtue and specific propriety hid in the kettles and pans,which, as the loadstone attracts iron, draws the monks there,and cannot attract emperors, popes, or kings? Or is it a natu-ral induction and inclination, fixed in the frocks and cowls,which of itself leads and forceth those good religious meninto kitchens, whether they will or no? He would speak offorms following matter, as Averroes calls them, answeredEpistemon. Right, said Friar John.I will not offer to solve this problem, said Pantagruel; for itis somewhat ticklish, and you can hardly handle it withoutcoming off scurvily; but I will tell you what I have heard.Antigonus, King of Macedon, one day coming into one ofthe tents, where his cooks used to dress his meat, and findingthere poet Antagoras frying a conger, and holding the panhimself, merrily asked him, Pray, Mr. Poet, was Homer fryingcongers when he wrote the deeds of Agamemnon? Antagorasreadily answered: But do you think, sir, that when Agamemnondid them he made it his business to know if any in his campwere frying congers? The king thought it an indecency that apoet should be thus a-frying in a kitchen; and the poet let theking know that it was a more indecent thing for a king to befound in such a place. I’ll clap another story upon the neck ofthis, quoth Panurge, and will tell you what Breton Villandryanswered one day to the Duke of Guise.They were saying that at a certain battle of King Francisagainst Charles the Fifth, Breton, armed cap-a-pie to theteeth, and mounted like St. George, yet sneaked off, andplayed least in sight during the engagement.

They neither invited us to eat or drink; but, with amultiplied train of scrapes and cringes, said they were all atour service for the Legem pone.One of our droggermen related to Pantagruel their strangeway of living, diametrically opposed to that of our modernRomans; for at Rome a world of folks get an honest liveli-hood by poisoning, drubbing, lambasting, stabbing, andmurthering; but the catchpoles earn theirs by being thrashed;so that if they were long without a tight lambasting, the poordogs with their wives and children would be starved. This isjust, quoth Panurge, like those who, as Galen tells us, can-not erect the cavernous nerve towards the equinoctial circleunless they are soundly flogged. By St. Patrick’s slipper, who-ever should jerk me so, would soon, instead of setting meright, throw me off the saddle, in the devil’s name.The way is this, said the interpreter. When a monk, levite,close-fisted usurer, or lawyer owes a grudge to someneighbouring gentleman, he sends to him one of thosecatchpoles or apparitors, who nabs, or at least cites him, servesa writ or warrant upon him, thumps, abuses, and affrontshim impudently by natural instinct, and according to hispious instructions; insomuch, that if the gentleman hath butany guts in his brains, and is not more stupid than a gyrinfrog, he will find himself obliged either to apply a faggot-stick or his sword to the rascal’s jobbernowl, give him the"},{"pageNumber":552,"pageContent":"552Gargantua & Pantagruelgentle lash, or make him cut a caper out at the window, byway of correction. This done, Catchpole is rich for four monthsat least, as if bastinadoes were his real harvest; for the monk,levite, usurer, or lawyer will reward him roundly; and my gentle-man must pay him such swingeing damages that his acres mustbleed for it, and he be in danger of miserably rotting within astone doublet, as if he had struck the king.Quoth Panurge, I know an excellent remedy against thisused by the Lord of Basche. What is it? said Pantagruel. TheLord of Basche, said Panurge, was a brave, honest, noble-spirited gentleman, who, at his return from the long war inwhich the Duke of Ferrara, with the help of the French,bravely defended himself against the fury of Pope Julius theSecond, was every day cited, warned, and prosecuted at thesuit and for the sport and fancy of the fat prior of St. Louant.One morning, as he was at breakfast with some of his do-mestics (for he loved to be sometimes among them) he sentfor one Loire, his baker, and his spouse, and for one Oudart,the vicar of his parish, who was also his butler, as the customwas then in France; then said to them before his gentlemenand other servants: You all see how I am daily plagued withthese rascally catchpoles. Truly, if you do not lend me yourhelping hand, I am finally resolved to leave the country, andgo fight for the sultan, or the devil, rather than be thus eter-nally teased. Therefore, to be rid of their damned visits, here-after, when any of them come here, be ready, you baker andyour wife, to make your personal appearance in my greathall, in your wedding clothes, as if you were going to beaffianced. Here, take these ducats, which I give you to keepyou in a fitting garb. As for you, Sir Oudart, be sure youmake your personal appearance there in your fine surpliceand stole, not forgetting your holy water, as if you were towed them. Be you there also, Trudon, said he to his drum-mer, with your pipe and tabor. The form of matrimony mustbe read, and the bride kissed; then all of you, as the witnessesused to do in this country, shall give one another the re-membrance of the wedding, which you know is to be a blowwith your fist, bidding the party struck remember the nup-tials by that token. This will but make you have the betterstomach to your supper; but when you come to the catchpole’sturn, thrash him thrice the threefold, as you would a sheaf ofgreen corn; do not spare him; maul him, drub him, lambast"},{"pageNumber":553,"pageContent":"553Rabelaishim, swinge him off, I pray you.

Fear not to be called to an account about it; I willstand by you; for the blows must seem to be given in jest, asit is customary among us at all weddings.Ay, but how shall we know the catchpole? said the man ofGod. All sorts of people daily resort to this castle. I havetaken care of that, replied the lord. When some fellow, eitheron foot, or on a scurvy jade, with a large broad silver ring onhis thumb, comes to the door, he is certainly a catchpole; theporter having civilly let him in, shall ring the bell; then be allready, and come into the hall, to act the tragi-comedy whoseplot I have now laid for you.That numerical day, as chance would have it, came an oldfat ruddy catchpole. Having knocked at the gate, and thenpissed, as most men will do, the porter soon found him out,by his large greasy spatterdashes, his jaded hollow-flankedmare, his bagful of writs and informations dangling at hisgirdle, but, above all, by the large silver hoop on his leftthumb.The porter was civil to him, admitted him in kindly, andrung the bell briskly. As soon as the baker and his wife heardit, they clapped on their best clothes, and made their per-sonal appearance in the hall, keeping their gravities like anew-made judge. The dominie put on his surplice and stole,and as he came out of his office, met the catchpole, had himin there, and made him suck his face a good while, while thegauntlets were drawing on all hands; and then told him, Youare come just in pudding-time; my lord is in his right cue.We shall feast like kings anon; here is to be swingeing do-ings; we have a wedding in the house; here, drink and cheerup; pull away.While these two were at it hand-to-fist, Basche, seeing allhis people in the hall in their proper equipage, sends for thevicar. Oudart comes with the holy-water pot, followed bythe catchpole, who, as he came into the hall, did not forgetto make good store of awkward cringes, and then servedBasche with a writ. Basche gave him grimace for grimace,slipped an angel into his mutton-fist, and prayed him to as-sist at the contract and ceremony; which he did. When itwas ended, thumps and fisticuffs began to fly about among"},{"pageNumber":554,"pageContent":"554Gargantua & Pantagruelthe assistants; but when it came to the catchpole’s turn, theyall laid on him so unmercifully with their gauntlets that theyat last settled him, all stunned and battered, bruised and mor-tified, with one of his eyes black and blue, eight ribs bruised,his brisket sunk in, his omoplates in four quarters, his underjawbone in three pieces; and all this in jest, and no harmdone. God wot how the levite belaboured him, hiding withinthe long sleeve of his canonical shirt his huge steel gauntletlined with ermine; for he was a strong-built ball, and an olddog at fisticuffs. The catchpole, all of a bloody tiger-like stripe,with much ado crawled home to L’Isle Bouchart, well pleasedand edified, however, with Basche’s kind reception; and, withthe help of the good surgeons of the place, lived as long asyou would have him. From that time to this, not a word ofthe business; the memory of it was lost with the sound of thebells that rung with joy at his funeral.Chapter 4.XIII.Chapter 4.XIII.Chapter 4.XIII.Chapter 4.XIII.Chapter 4.XIII.HHHHHooooowwwww, like M, like M, like M, like M, like Master Faster Faster Faster Faster Francis rancis rancis rancis rancis VVVVVillon, the Lorillon, the Lorillon, the Lorillon, the Lorillon, the Lord of Bd of Bd of Bd of Bd of Bascheascheascheascheaschecommended his sercommended his sercommended his sercommended his sercommended his servvvvvants.ants.ants.ants.ants.The catchpole being packed off on blind Sorrel—so he calledhis one-eyed mare—Basche sent for his lady, her women,and all his servants, into the arbour of his garden; had winebrought, attended with good store of pasties, hams, fruit,and other table-ammunition, for a nunchion; drank withthem joyfully, and then told them this story:Master Francis Villon in his old age retired to St. Maxentin Poitou, under the patronage of a good honest abbot of theplace. There to make sport for the mob, he undertook to getthe Passion acted, after the way, and in the dialect of thecountry. The parts being distributed, the play having beenrehearsed, and the stage prepared, he told the mayor andaldermen that the mystery might be ready after Niort fair,and that there only wanted properties and necessaries, butchiefly clothes fit for the parts; so the mayor and his breth-ren took care to get them."},{"pageNumber":555,"pageContent":"555RabelaisVillon, to dress an old clownish father greybeard, who wasto represent God the father, begged of Friar StephenTickletoby, sacristan to the Franciscan friars of the place, tolend him a cope and a stole. Tickletoby refused him, allegingthat by their provincial statutes it was rigorously forbiddento give or lend anything to players. Villon replied that thestatute reached no farther than farces, drolls, antics, looseand dissolute games, and that he asked no more than whathe had seen allowed at Brussels and other places. Tickletobynotwithstanding peremptorily bid him provide himself else-where if he would, and not to hope for anything out of hismonastical wardrobe. Villon gave an account of this to theplayers, as of a most abominable action; adding, that Godwould shortly revenge himself, and make an example ofTickletoby.The Saturday following he had notice given him thatTickletoby, upon the filly of the convent—so they call a youngmare that was never leaped yet—was gone a-mumping to St.Ligarius, and would be back about two in the afternoon.Knowing this, he made a cavalcade of his devils of the Pas-sion through the town. They were all rigged with wolves’,calves’, and rams’ skins, laced and trimmed with sheep’s heads,bull’s feathers, and large kitchen tenterhooks, girt with broadleathern girdles, whereat hanged dangling huge cow-bells andhorse-bells, which made a horrid din. Some held in theirclaws black sticks full of squibs and crackers; others had longlighted pieces of wood, upon which, at the corner of everystreet, they flung whole handfuls of rosin-dust, that made aterrible fire and smoke. Having thus led them about, to thegreat diversion of the mob and the dreadful fear of little chil-dren, he finally carried them to an entertainment at a sum-mer-house without the gate that leads to St. Ligarius.As they came near to the place, he espied Tickletoby afaroff, coming home from mumping, and told them inmacaronic verse: Hic est de patria, natus, de gente belistra, Qui solet antiqua bribas portare bisacco.

Well said, cried Villon; but let us hide our-selves till he comes by, and then charge him home brisklywith your squibs and burning sticks. Tickletoby being cometo the place, they all rushed on a sudden into the road tomeet him, and in a frightful manner threw fire from all sidesupon him and his filly foal, ringing and tingling their bells,and howling like so many real devils, Hho, hho, hho, hho,brrou, rrou, rrourrs, rrrourrs, hoo, hou, hou hho, hho, hhoi.Friar Stephen, don’t we play the devils rarely? The filly wassoon scared out of her seven senses, and began to start, tofunk it, to squirt it, to trot it, to fart it, to bound it, to gallopit, to kick it, to spurn it, to calcitrate it, to wince it, to friskit, to leap it, to curvet it, with double jerks, and bum-mo-tions; insomuch that she threw down Tickletoby, though heheld fast by the tree of the pack-saddle with might and main.Now his straps and stirrups were of cord; and on the rightside his sandals were so entangled and twisted that he couldnot for the heart’s blood of him get out his foot. Thus he wasdragged about by the filly through the road, scratching hisbare breech all the way; she still multiplying her kicks againsthim, and straying for fear over hedge and ditch, insomuchthat she trepanned his thick skull so that his cockle brainswere dashed out near the Osanna or high-cross. Then hisarms fell to pieces, one this way and the other that way; andeven so were his legs served at the same time. Then she madea bloody havoc with his puddings; and being got to the con-vent, brought back only his right foot and twisted sandal,leaving them to guess what was become of the rest.Villon, seeing that things had succeeded as he intended,said to his devils, You will act rarely, gentlemen devils, youwill act rarely; I dare engage you’ll top your parts. I defy thedevils of Saumur, Douay, Montmorillon, Langez, St. Espain,Angers; nay, by gad, even those of Poictiers, for all their brag-ging and vapouring, to match you.Thus, friends, said Basche, I foresee that hereafter you willact rarely this tragical farce, since the very first time you haveso skilfully hampered, bethwacked, belammed, andbebumped the catchpole.

Loire was kneading his dough; hiswife was sifting meal; Oudart was toping in his office; thegentlemen were playing at tennis; the Lord Basche at in-and-out with my lady; the waiting-men and gentle-womenat push-pin; the officers at lanterloo, and the pages at hot-cockles, giving one another smart bangs. They were all im-mediately informed that a catchpole was housed.Upon this Oudart put on his sacerdotal, and Loire and hiswife their nuptial badges; Trudon piped it, and then taboredit like mad; all made haste to get ready, not forgetting thegauntlets. Basche went into the outward yard; there the catch-pole meeting him fell on his marrow-bones, begged of him"},{"pageNumber":558,"pageContent":"558Gargantua & Pantagruelnot to take it ill if he served him with a writ at the suit of thefat prior; and in a pathetic speech let him know that he was apublic person, a servant to the monking tribe, apparitor to theabbatial mitre, ready to do as much for him, nay, for the leastof his servants, whensoever he would employ and use him.Nay, truly, said the lord, you shall not serve your writ tillyou have tasted some of my good Quinquenays wine, andbeen a witness to a wedding which we are to have this veryminute. Let him drink and refresh himself, added he, turn-ing towards the levitical butler, and then bring him into thehall. After which, Catchpole, well stuffed and moistened,came with Oudart to the place where all the actors in thefarce stood ready to begin. The sight of their game set thema-laughing, and the messenger of mischief grinned also forcompany’s sake. Then the mysterious words were mutteredto and by the couple, their hands joined, the bride bussed,and all besprinkled with holy water. While they were bring-ing wine and kickshaws, thumps began to trot about by doz-ens. The catchpole gave the levite several blows. Oudart, whohad his gauntlet hid under his canonical shirt, draws it onlike a mitten, and then, with his clenched fist, souse he fellon the catchpole and mauled him like a devil; the juniorgauntlets dropped on him likewise like so many batteringrams. Remember the wedding by this, by that, by these blows,said they. In short, they stroked him so to the purpose thathe pissed blood out at mouth, nose, ears, and eyes, and wasbruised, thwacked, battered, bebumped, and crippled at theback, neck, breast, arms, and so forth. Never did the bach-elors at Avignon in carnival time play more melodiously atraphe than was then played on the catchpole’s microcosm.At last down he fell.They threw a great deal of wine on his snout, tied round thesleeve of his doublet a fine yellow and green favour, and got himupon his snotty beast, and God knows how he got to L’IsleBouchart; where I cannot truly tell you whether he was dressedand looked after or no, both by his spouse and the able doctorsof the country; for the thing never came to my ears.The next day they had a third part to the same tune, be-cause it did not appear by the lean catchpole’s bag that hehad served his writ. So the fat prior sent a new catchpole, atthe head of a brace of bums for his garde du corps, to sum-mon my lord.

Baschewas at dinner with his lady and the gentlemen; so he sent forthe catchpole, made him sit by him, and the bums by thewomen, and made them eat till their bellies cracked withtheir breeches unbuttoned. The fruit being served, the catch-pole arose from table, and before the bums cited Basche.Basche kindly asked him for a copy of the warrant, whichthe other had got ready; he then takes witness and a copy ofthe summons. To the catchpole and his bums he orderedfour ducats for civility money. In the meantime all were with-drawn for the farce. So Trudon gave the alarm with his ta-bor. Basche desired the catchpole to stay and see one of hisservants married, and witness the contract of marriage, pay-ing him his fee. The catchpole slapdash was ready, took outhis inkhorn, got paper immediately, and his bums by him.Then Loire came into the hall at one door, and his wifewith the gentlewomen at another, in nuptial accoutrements.Oudart, in pontificalibus, takes them both by their hands,asketh them their will, giveth them the matrimonial bless-ing, and was very liberal of holy water.

Then the tabor beata retreat; the gauntlets were carefully hid in a trice, and sweet-meats afresh distributed to renew the mirth of the company.So they all drank to one another, and especially to the catch-pole and his bums. But Oudart cursed and damned the wed-ding to the pit of hell, complaining that one of the bumshad utterly disincornifistibulated his nether shoulder-blade.Nevertheless, he scorned to be thought a flincher, and madeshift to tope to him on the square.The jawless bum shrugged up his shoulders, joined hishands, and by signs begged his pardon; for speak he couldnot.

ByOur Lady of Riviere, the blessed dame, I meant no moreharm than the child unborn. One of the equerries, who,hopping and halting like a mumping cripple, mimickedthe good limping Lord de la Roche Posay, directed his dis-course to the bum with the pouting jaw, and told him:What, Mr. Manhound, was it not enough thus to havemorcrocastebezasteverestegrigeligoscopapopondrillated us allin our upper members with your botched mittens,"},{"pageNumber":561,"pageContent":"561Rabelaisbut you must also apply suchmorderegripippiatabirofreluchamburelurecaquelurintimpanimentson our shinbones with the hard tops and extremities of yourcobbled shoes.

The bride crying laughed, andlaughing cried, because the catchpole was not satisfied withdrubbing her without choice or distinction of members, buthad also rudely roused and toused her, pulled off her topping,and not having the fear of her husband before his eyes, treach-erously trepignemanpenillorifrizonoufresterfumbledtumbledand squeezed her lower parts.

But this I plainly perceive, that he cited me likean angel, and drubbed me like a devil. He had something inhim of Friar Thumpwell. Come, for all this, I must drink tohim, and to you likewise, his trusty esquires. But, said hislady, why hath he been so very liberal of his manual kind-ness to me, without the least provocation? I assure you, I byno means like it; but this I dare say for him, that he hath thehardest knuckles that ever I felt on my shoulders. The stew-ard held his left arm in a scarf, as if it had been rent and tornin twain. I think it was the devil, said he, that moved me toassist at these nuptials; shame on ill luck; I must needs bemeddling with a pox, and now see what I have got by thebargain, both my arms are wretchedly engoulevezinemassedand bruised. Do you call this a wedding? By St. Bridget’stooth, I had rather be at that of a Tom T—d-man. This is, o’my word, even just such another feast as was that of theLapithae, described by the philosopher of Samosata. One ofthe bums had lost his tongue. The other two, tho’ they hadmore need to complain, made their excuse as well as theycould, protesting that they had no ill design in this dumb-founding; begging that, for goodness sake, they would for-give them; and so, tho’ they could hardly budge a foot, orwag along, away they crawled. About a mile from Basche’sseat, the catchpole found himself somewhat out of sorts.

So they lived I cannot exactly tell youhow many days after this. But from that time to this it washeld for a certain truth that Basche’s money was more pesti-lential, mortal, and pernicious to the catchpoles and bumsthan were formerly the aurum Tholosanum and the Sejanhorse to those that possessed them.

It hadbeen better, said Epistemon, if those gauntlets had fallen uponthe fat prior. Since he took a pleasure in spending his moneypartly to vex Basche, partly to see those catchpoles banged,good lusty thumps would have done well on his shaved crown,considering the horrid concussions nowadays among thosepuny judges. What harm had done those poor devils thecatchpoles? This puts me in mind, said Pantagruel, of anancient Roman named L. Neratius. He was of noble blood,and for some time was rich; but had this tyrannical inclina-tion, that whenever he went out of doors he caused his ser-vants to fill their pockets with gold and silver, and meetingin the street your spruce gallants and better sort of beaux,without the least provocation, for his fancy, he used to strikethem hard on the face with his fist; and immediately afterthat, to appease them and hinder them from complaining tothe magistrates, he would give them as much money as satis-fied them according to the law of the twelve tables. Thus heused to spend his revenue, beating people for the price of hismoney. By St. Bennet’s sacred boot, quoth Friar John, I willknow the truth of it presently.This said, he went on shore, put his hand in his fob, andtook out twenty ducats; then said with a loud voice, in thehearing of a shoal of the nation of catchpoles, Who will earntwenty ducats for being beaten like the devil?

He had no sooner picked him out from the rest,but I perceived that they all muttered and grumbled; and Iheard a young thin-jawed catchpole, a notable scholar, a prettyfellow at his pen, and, according to public report, much criedup for his honesty at Doctors’ Commons, making his com-plaint and muttering because this same crimson phiz carriedaway all the practice, and that if there were but a score and ahalf of bastinadoes to be got, he would certainly run awaywith eight and twenty of them. But all this was looked uponto be nothing but mere envy.Friar John so unmercifully thrashed, thumped, andbelaboured Red-snout, back and belly, sides, legs, and arms,head, feet, and so forth, with the home and farewell repeatedapplication of one of the best members of a faggot, that Itook him to be a dead man; then he gave him the twentyducats, which made the dog get on his legs, pleased like alittle king or two.

Pantagruelhad kept on board, and already had caused a retreat to besounded. Thinking that they might be related to the catch-pole that was bastinadoed, we asked them the occasion of theirgrief. They replied that they had too much cause to weep; forthat very hour, from an exalted triple tree, two of the honestestgentlemen in Catchpole-land had been made to cut a caperon nothing. Cut a caper on nothing, said Gymnast; my pagesuse to cut capers on the ground; to cut a caper on nothingshould be hanging and choking, or I am out.

The fatal day being come in its turn, he removedhimself out of town, far from all houses, trees, (rocks,) orany other things that can fall and endanger by their ruin;and strayed in a large field, trusting himself to the open sky;there very secure, as he thought, unless indeed the sky shouldhappen to fall, which he held to be impossible. Yet they saythat the larks are much afraid of it; for if it should fall, theymust all be taken.The Celts that once lived near the Rhine—they are ournoble valiant French—in ancient times were also afraid ofthe sky’s falling; for being asked by Alexander the Great whatthey feared most in this world, hoping well they would saythat they feared none but him, considering his great achieve-ments, they made answer that they feared nothing but thesky’s falling; however, not refusing to enter into a confed-eracy with so brave a king, if you believe Strabo, lib. 7, andArrian, lib. I.Plutarch also, in his book of the face that appears on thebody of the moon, speaks of one Phenaces, who very muchfeared the moon should fall on the earth, and pitied thosethat live under that planet, as the Aethiopians andTaprobanians, if so heavy a mass ever happened to fall onthem, and would have feared the like of heaven and earthhad they not been duly propped up and borne by the Atlan-tic pillars, as the ancients believed, according to Aristotle’stestimony, lib. 5, Metaphys. Notwithstanding all this, poorAeschylus was killed by the fall of the shell of a tortoise,which falling from betwixt the claws of an eagle high in theair, just on his head, dashed out his brains.Neither ought you to wonder at the death of another poet,I mean old jolly Anacreon, who was choked with a grape-stone.

He had no sooner said this, but he was soexcessively pleased, and fell into so exorbitant a fit of laugh-ter, that the use of his spleen took that of his breath utterlyaway, and he immediately died.

Panurge was overjoyed to seethem, being most certain of good luck for that day and along train of others. So having courteously saluted the blessedfathers, and recommended the salvation of his precious soulto their devout prayers and private ejaculations, he causedseventy-eight dozen of Westphalia hams, units of pots of cavi-are, tens of Bolonia sausages, hundreds of botargoes, andthousands of fine angels, for the souls of the dead, to bethrown on board their ships.

For as to fear in all encounters is the mark of a heavy andcowardly heart, as Agamemnon did, who for that reason isignominiously taxed by Achilles with having dog’s eyes anda stag’s heart; so, not to fear when the case is evidently dreadfulis a sign of want or smallness of judgment. Now, if anythingought to be feared in this life, next to offending God, I willnot say it is death. I will not meddle with the disputes ofSocrates and the academics, that death of itself is neither badnor to be feared, but I will affirm that this kind of shipwreckis to be feared, or nothing is. For, as Homer saith, it is agrievous, dreadful, and unnatural thing to perish at sea. Andindeed Aeneas, in the storm that took his fleet near Sicily,was grieved that he had not died by the hand of the braveDiomedes, and said that those were three, nay four timeshappy, who perished in the conflagration at Troy.

Nevertheless, we ought to implore, invoke, pray,beseech, and supplicate him; but we must not stop there; itbehoveth us also to use our endeavours on our side, and, asthe holy writ saith, to co-operate with him.You know what C. Flaminius, the consul, said when byHannibal’s policy he was penned up near the lake of Peruse,alias Thrasymene. Friends, said he to his soldiers, you mustnot hope to get out of this place barely by vows or prayers tothe gods; no, ’tis by fortitude and strength we must escapeand cut ourselves a way with the edge of our swords throughthe midst of our enemies.Sallust likewise makes M.

If aman in time of need and danger is negligent, heartless, andlazy, in vain he implores the gods; they are then justly angryand incensed against him.

Being asked what ship he reckoned the safest,he replied: That which is in the harbour. He made a yetbetter repartee, said Pantagruel, when somebody inquiringwhich is greater, the number of the living or that of the dead,he asked them amongst which of the two they reckoned thosethat are at sea, ingeniously implying that they are continu-ally in danger of death, dying alive, and living die.

His skin,then, said Pantagruel, should be like the herb called truemaiden’s hair, which never takes wet nor moistness, but stillkeeps dry, though you lay it at the bottom of the water aslong as you please; and for that reason is called Adiantos.Friend Panurge, said Friar John, I pray thee never be afraidof water; thy life for mine thou art threatened with a con-trary element. Ay, ay, replied Panurge, but the devil’s cooksdote sometimes, and are apt to make horrid blunders as wellas others; often putting to boil in water what was designedto be roasted on the fire; like the head-cooks of our kitchen,who often lard partridges, queests, and stock-doves with in-tent to roast them, one would think; but it happens some-times that they e’en turn the partridges into the pot to beboiled with cabbages, the queests with leek pottage, and thestock-doves with turnips.

The goodpeople of the place received us very honourably. An oldMacrobius (so they called their eldest elderman) desiredPantagruel to come to the town-house to refresh himself andeat something, but he would not budge a foot from the moletill all his men were landed. After he had seen them, he gaveorder that they should all change clothes, and that some ofall the stores in the fleet should be brought on shore, thatevery ship’s crew might live well; which was accordingly done,and God wot how well they all toped and caroused.

When they hadwell stuffed the insides of their doublets, Pantagruel desiredeveryone to lend their help to repair the damage; which theyreadily did. It was easy enough to refit there; for all the in-habitants of the island were carpenters and all such handi-crafts as are seen in the arsenal at Venice. None but the larg-est island was inhabited, having three ports and ten parishes;the rest being overrun with wood and desert, much like theforest of Arden. We entreated the old Macrobius to show uswhat was worth seeing in the island; which he did; and inthe desert and dark forest we discovered several old ruinedtemples, obelisks, pyramids, monuments, and ancient tombs,with divers inscriptions and epitaphs; some of them in hi-eroglyphic characters; others in the Ionic dialect; some inthe Arabic, Agarenian, Slavonian, and other tongues; of whichEpistemon took an exact account.

After that, he asked himwhat he judged to be the cause of that terrible tempest, andif the adjacent seas were thus frequently subject to storms; asin the ocean are the Ratz of Sammaieu, Maumusson, and inthe Mediterranean sea the Gulf of Sataly, Montargentan,Piombino, Capo Melio in Laconia, the Straits of Gibraltar,Faro di Messina, and others.Chapter 4.XXVI.Chapter 4.XXVI.Chapter 4.XXVI.Chapter 4.XXVI.Chapter 4.XXVI.HHHHHooooow the good Mw the good Mw the good Mw the good Mw the good Macracracracracrobius gavobius gavobius gavobius gavobius gave us an account of thee us an account of thee us an account of thee us an account of thee us an account of themansion and decease of the hermansion and decease of the hermansion and decease of the hermansion and decease of the hermansion and decease of the heroes.oes.oes.oes.oes.The good Macrobius then answered, Friendly strangers, thisisland is one of the Sporades; not of your Sporades that lie inthe Carpathian sea, but one of the Sporades of the ocean; informer times rich, frequented, wealthy, populous, full of traf-fic, and in the dominions of the rulers of Britain, but now,by course of time, and in these latter ages of the world, poorand desolate, as you see.

Theymade their personal appearance; whereupon he caused themall to be shut up in the hippodrome of the seraglio; then saidto his sister Salome and Alexander her husband: I am certainthat the Jews will rejoice at my death; but if you will observeand perform what I tell you, my funeral shall be honourable,"},{"pageNumber":584,"pageContent":"584Gargantua & Pantagrueland there will be a general mourning.

Not altogether unlike this was what was formerlydone at Athens by the judges of the Areopagus. For whenthey gave their verdict to cast or clear the culprits that weretried before them, they used certain notes according to thesubstance of the sentences; by Theta signifying condemna-tion to death; by T, absolution; by A, ampliation or a demur,when the case was not sufficiently examined. Thus havingpublicly set up those letters, they eased the relations andfriends of the prisoners, and such others as desired to knowtheir doom, of their doubts.

With whom con-curs Martianus Capella.

Then thevoice, louder than before, bid him publish when he shouldcome to Palodes, that the great god Pan was dead.Epitherses related that all the mariners and passengers, hav-ing heard this, were extremely amazed and frighted; and that,consulting among themselves whether they had best concealor divulge what the voice had enjoined, Thamous said hisadvice was that if they happened to have a fair wind theyshould proceed without mentioning a word on’t, but if theychanced to be becalmed he would publish what he had heard.Now when they were near Palodes they had no wind, nei-ther were they in any current. Thamous then getting up onthe top of the ship’s forecastle, and casting his eyes on theshore, said that he had been commanded to proclaim thatthe great god Pan was dead. The words were hardly out ofhis mouth, when deep groans, great lamentations, and dole-ful shrieks, not of one person, but of many together, wereheard from the land.The news of this—many being present then—was soonspread at Rome; insomuch that Tiberius, who was then em-peror, sent for this Thamous, and having heard him gavecredit to his words. And inquiring of the learned in his courtand at Rome who was that Pan, he found by their relationthat he was the son of Mercury and Penelope, as Herodotusand Cicero in his third book of the Nature of the Gods hadwritten before.For my part, I understand it of that great Saviour of thefaithful who was shamefully put to death at Jerusalem by theenvy and wickedness of the doctors, priests, and monks ofthe Mosaic law.

For all that we are, all that we live,all that we have, all that we hope, is him, by him, from him,and in him. He is the good Pan, the great shepherd, who, asthe loving shepherd Corydon affirms, hath not only a ten-der love and affection for his sheep, but also for their shep-herds. At his death, complaints, sighs, fears, and lamenta-tions were spread through the whole fabric of the universe,whether heavens, land, sea, or hell.The time also concurs with this interpretation of mine; forthis most good, most mighty Pan, our only Saviour, diednear Jerusalem during the reign of Tiberius Caesar.Pantagruel, having ended this discourse, remained silentand full of contemplation.

Youalso tell us wonders of the industry of the ancient Franks,who were preferred to all others in point of archery; andwhen they hunted either black or dun beasts, used to rub thehead of their arrows with hellebore, because the flesh of thevenison struck with such an arrow was more tender, dainty,wholesome, and delicious—paring off, nevertheless, the partthat was touched round about. You also talk of the Parthians,who used to shoot backwards more dexterously than othernations forwards; and also celebrate the skill of the Scythiansin that art, who sent once to Darius, King of Persia, an am-bassador that made him a present of a bird, a frog, a mouse,and five arrows, without speaking one word; and being askedwhat those presents meant, and if he had commission to sayanything, answered that he had not; which puzzled and grav-elled Darius very much, till Gobrias, one of the seven cap-tains that had killed the magi, explained it, saying to Darius:By these gifts and offerings the Scythians silently tell youthat except the Persians like birds fly up to heaven, or likemice hide themselves near the centre of the earth, or likefrogs dive to the very bottom of ponds and lakes, they shallbe destroyed by the power and arrows of the Scythians.The noble Pantagruel was, without comparison, more ad-mirable yet in the art of shooting and darting; for with hisdreadful piles and darts, nearly resembling the huge beamsthat support the bridges of Nantes, Saumur, Bergerac, andat Paris the millers’ and the changers’ bridges, in length, size,weight, and iron-work, he at a mile’s distance would open anoyster and never touch the edges; he would snuff a candlewithout putting it out; would shoot a magpie in the eye;take off a boot’s under-sole, or a riding-hood’s lining, with-out soiling them a bit; turn over every leaf of Friar John’sbreviary, one after another, and not tear one.With such darts, of which there was good store in the ship,at the first blow he ran the physeter in at the forehead sofuriously that he pierced both its jaws and tongue; so thatfrom that time to this it no more opened its guttural trap-door, nor drew and spouted water.

Pantagruel, not satisfied with this, let fly another dart,which took the monster under the tail likewise sloping; thenwith three other on the chine, in a perpendicular line, di-vided its flank from the tail to the snout at an equal distance.Then he larded it with fifty on one side, and after that, tomake even work, he darted as many on its other side; so thatthe body of the physeter seemed like the hulk of a galleonwith three masts, joined by a competent dimension of itsbeams, as if they had been the ribs and chain-wales of thekeel; which was a pleasant sight. The physeter then givingup the ghost, turned itself upon its back, as all dead fishesdo; and being thus overturned, with the beams and dartsupside down in the sea, it seemed a scolopendra or centi-pede, as that serpent is described by the ancient sage Nicander.Chapter 4.XXXVChapter 4.XXXVChapter 4.XXXVChapter 4.XXXVChapter 4.XXXV.....HHHHHooooow Pw Pw Pw Pw Pantagrantagrantagrantagrantagruel wuel wuel wuel wuel went on shorent on shorent on shorent on shorent on shore in the e in the e in the e in the e in the WWWWWild Iild Iild Iild Iild Island,sland,sland,sland,sland,the ancient abode of the Chitterlings.the ancient abode of the Chitterlings.the ancient abode of the Chitterlings.the ancient abode of the Chitterlings.the ancient abode of the Chitterlings.The boat’s crew of the ship Lantern towed the physeter ashoreon the neighbouring shore, which happened to be the WildIsland, to make an anatomical dissection of its body andsave the fat of its kidneys, which, they said, was very usefuland necessary for the cure of a certain distemper, which theycalled want of money.

Which made him ask Xenomanes what kind ofcreatures these were, taking them for squirrels, weasels, mar-tins, or ermines. They are Chitterlings, replied Xenomanes.This is the Wild Island of which I spoke to you this morn-ing; there hath been an irreconcilable war this long time be-tween them and Shrovetide, their malicious and ancient en-emy. I believe that the noise of the guns which we fired atthe physeter hath alarmed them, and made them fear theirenemy was come with his forces to surprise them, or lay theisland waste, as he hath often attempted to do; though hestill came off but bluely, by reason of the care and vigilanceof the Chitterlings, who (as Dido said to Aeneas’s compan-ions that would have landed at Carthage without her leaveor knowledge) were forced to watch and stand upon theirguard, considering the malice of their enemy and theneighbourhood of his territories.Pray, dear friend, said Pantagruel, if you find that by somehonest means we may bring this war to an end, and recon-cile them together, give notice of it; I will use my endeavoursin it with all my heart, and spare nothing on my side tomoderate and accommodate the points in dispute betweenboth parties.That’s impossible at this time, answered Xenomanes. Aboutfour years ago, passing incognito by this country, I endeav-oured to make a peace, or at least a long truce among them;and I had certainly brought them to be good friends andneighbours if both one and the other parties would haveyielded to one single article. Shrovetide would not includein the treaty of peace the wild puddings nor the highlandsausages, their ancient gossips and confederates. The Chit-terlings demanded that the fort of Cacques might be undertheir government, as is the Castle of Sullouoir, and that aparcel of I don’t know what stinking villains, murderers, rob-bers, that held it then, should be expelled. But they couldnot agree in this, and the terms that were offered seemed toohard to either party. So the treaty broke off, and nothing wasdone.

By the conjecture of seventy-eight standards whichwe told, we guessed their number to be two and forty thou-sand, at a modest computation.Their order, proud gait, and resolute looks made us judgethat they were none of your raw, paltry links, but old warlikeChitterlings and Sausages.

Per-haps, said he, it may be the usual guard of the queen of theplace, who, having notice given her by the junior Chitter-lings of the forlorn hope whom you saw on the tree, of thearrival of your fine and pompous fleet, hath judged that itwas without doubt some rich and potent prince, and is cometo visit you in person.Pantagruel, little trusting to this, called a council, to havetheir advice at large in this doubtful case. He briefly showedthem how this way of reception with arms had often, undercolour of compliment and friendship, been fatal. Thus, saidhe, the Emperor Antonius Caracalla at one time destroyedthe citizens of Alexandria, and at another time cut off theattendants of Artabanus, King of Persia, under colour ofmarrying his daughter, which, by the way, did not pass un-punished, for a while after this cost him his life.Thus Jacob’s children destroyed the Sichemites, to revengethe rape of their sister Dinah. By such another hypocriticaltrick Gallienus, the Roman emperor, put to death the mili-tary men in Constantinople. Thus, under colour of friend-ship, Antonius enticed Artavasdes, King of Armenia; then,having caused him to be bound in heavy chains and shack-led, at last put him to death.We find a thousand such instances in history; and KingCharles VI. is justly commended for his prudence to thisday, in that, coming back victorious over the Ghenters andother Flemings to his good city of Paris, and when he cameto Bourget, a league from thence, hearing that the citizenswith their mallets—whence they got the name ofMaillotins—were marched out of town in battalia, twentythousand strong, he would not go into the town till they hadlaid down their arms and retired to their respective homes;though they protested to him that they had taken arms withno other design than to receive him with the greater demon-stration of honour and respect."},{"pageNumber":604,"pageContent":"604Gargantua & PantagruelChapter 4.XXXVII.Chapter 4.XXXVII.Chapter 4.XXXVII.Chapter 4.XXXVII.Chapter 4.XXXVII.HHHHHooooow Pw Pw Pw Pw Pantagrantagrantagrantagrantagruel sent for Colonel Muel sent for Colonel Muel sent for Colonel Muel sent for Colonel Muel sent for Colonel Maul-chitterling andaul-chitterling andaul-chitterling andaul-chitterling andaul-chitterling andColonel CColonel CColonel CColonel CColonel Cut-pudding; with a discourse wut-pudding; with a discourse wut-pudding; with a discourse wut-pudding; with a discourse wut-pudding; with a discourse well worell worell worell worell worth yth yth yth yth yourourourourourhearing about the names of places and persons.hearing about the names of places and persons.hearing about the names of places and persons.hearing about the names of places and persons.hearing about the names of places and persons.The resolution of the council was that, let things be howthey would, it behoved the Pantagruelists to stand upon theirguard. Therefore Carpalin and Gymnast were ordered byPantagruel to go for the soldiers that were on board the Cupgalley, under the command of Colonel Maul-chitterling, andthose on board the Vine-tub frigate, under the command ofColonel Cut-pudding the younger. I will ease Gymnast ofthat trouble, said Panurge, who wanted to be upon the run;you may have occasion for him here.

Having said this, hewheeled off.Then said Epistemon to Pantagruel: The denomination ofthese two colonels of yours, Maul-chitterling and Cut-pud-ding, promiseth us assurance, success, and victory, if thoseChitterlings should chance to set upon us. You take it rightly,said Pantagruel, and it pleaseth me to see you foresee andprognosticate our victory by the names of our colonels.This way of foretelling by names is not new; it was in oldtimes celebrated and religiously observed by the Pythagoreans.Several great princes and emperors have formerly made gooduse of it. Octavianus Augustus, second emperor of the Ro-mans, meeting on a day a country fellow named Eutychus—that is, fortunate—driving an ass named Nicon—that is, inGreek, Victorian—moved by the signification of the ass’s andass-driver’s names, remained assured of all prosperity andvictory."},{"pageNumber":605,"pageContent":"605RabelaisThe Emperor Vespasian being once all alone at prayers inthe temple of Serapis, at the sight and unexpected coming ofa certain servant of his named Basilides—that is, royal—whom he had left sick a great way behind, took hopes andassurance of obtaining the empire of the Romans. Regilianwas chosen emperor by the soldiers for no other reason butthe signification of his name. See the Cratylus of the divinePlato. (By my thirst, I will read it, said Rhizotome; I hearyou so often quote it.) See how the Pythagoreans, by reasonof the names and numbers, conclude that Patroclus was tofall by the hand of Hector; Hector by Achilles; Achilles byParis; Paris by Philoctetes. I am quite lost in my understand-ing when I reflect upon the admirable invention ofPythagoras, who by the number, either even or odd, of thesyllables of every name, would tell you of what side a manwas lame, hulch-backed, blind, gouty, troubled with the palsy,pleurisy, or any other distemper incident to humankind; al-lotting even numbers to the left (Motteux reads—’even num-bers to the Right, and odd ones to the Left.’), and odd onesto the right side of the body.Indeed, said Epistemon, I saw this way of syllabizing triedat Xaintes at a general procession, in the presence of thatgood, virtuous, learned and just president, Brian Vallee, Lordof Douhait. When there went by a man or woman that waseither lame, blind of one eye, or humpbacked, he had anaccount brought him of his or her name; and if the syllablesof the name were of an odd number, immediately, withoutseeing the persons, he declared them to be deformed, blind,lame, or crooked of the right side; and of the left, if theywere even in number; and such indeed we ever found them.By this syllabical invention, said Pantagruel, the learned haveaffirmed that Achilles kneeling was wounded by the arrow ofParis in the right heel, for his name is of odd syllables (here weought to observe that the ancients used to kneel the right foot);and that Venus was also wounded before Troy in the left hand,for her name in Greek is (Greek), of four syllables; Vulcanlamed of his left foot for the same reason; Philip, King ofMacedon, and Hannibal, blind of the right eye; not to speakof sciaticas, broken bellies, and hemicranias, which may bedistinguished by this Pythagorean reason.But returning to names: do but consider how Alexanderthe Great, son of King Philip, of whom we spoke just now,"},{"pageNumber":606,"pageContent":"606Gargantua & Pantagruelcompassed his undertaking merely by the interpretation of aname. He had besieged the strong city of Tyre, and for sev-eral weeks battered it with all his power; but all in vain. Hisengines and attempts were still baffled by the Tyrians, whichmade him finally resolve to raise the siege, to his great grief;foreseeing the great stain which such a shameful retreat wouldbe to his reputation. In this anxiety and agitation of mind hefell asleep and dreamed that a satyr was come into his tent,capering, skipping, and tripping it up and down, with hisgoatish hoofs, and that he strove to lay hold on him. But thesatyr still slipped from him, till at last, having penned himup into a corner, he took him. With this he awoke, and tell-ing his dream to the philosophers and sages of his court,they let him know that it was a promise of victory from thegods, and that he should soon be master of Tyre; the wordsatyros divided in two being sa Tyros, and signifying Tyre isthine; and in truth, at the next onset, he took the town bystorm, and by a complete victory reduced that stubbornpeople to subjection.On the other hand, see how, by the signification of oneword, Pompey fell into despair. Being overcome by Caesarat the battle of Pharsalia, he had no other way left to escapebut by flight; which attempting by sea, he arrived near theisland of Cyprus, and perceived on the shore near the city ofPaphos a beautiful and stately palace; now asking the pilotwhat was the name of it, he told him that it was called (Greek),that is, evil king; which struck such a dread and terror inhim that he fell into despair, as being assured of losing shortlyhis life; insomuch that his complaints, sighs, and groans wereheard by the mariners and other passengers. And indeed, awhile after, a certain strange peasant, called Achillas, cut offhis head.To all these examples might be added what happened to L.Paulus Emilius when the senate elected him imperator, thatis, chief of the army which they sent against Perses, King ofMacedon. That evening returning home to prepare for hisexpedition, and kissing a little daughter of his called Trasia,she seemed somewhat sad to him. What is the matter, saidhe, my chicken? Why is my Trasia thus sad and melancholy?Daddy, replied the child, Persa is dead. This was the name ofa little bitch which she loved mightily.

Duringthe more than civil wars between Caesar and Pompey, thoughhe was much courted by the first, he naturally leaned moreto the side of the latter.

From that time,foreseeing that things would go ill with them, as it since hap-pened, he began to banter now one and then another, andbe very free of his cutting jests; so some of Pompey’s cap-tains, playing the good fellows to show their assurance, toldhim, Do you see how many eagles we have yet? (They werethen the device of the Romans in war.) They might be of useto you, replied Cicero, if you had to do with magpies.Thus, seeing we are to fight Chitterlings, pursued Pantagruel,you infer thence that it is a culinary war, and have a mind tojoin with the cooks.

But there happened a wonderfulthing, you may believe as little or as much of it as you please.From the north flew towards us a huge, fat, thick, grizzlyswine, with long and large wings, like those of a windmill;its plumes red crimson, like those of a phenicoptere (whichin Languedoc they call flaman); its eyes were red, and flam-ing like a carbuncle; its ears green, like a Prasin emerald; itsteeth like a topaz; its tail long and black, like jet; its feetwhite, diaphanous and transparent like a diamond, some-what broad, and of the splay kind, like those of geese, and asQueen Dick’s used to be at Toulouse in the days of yore.About its neck it wore a gold collar, round which were someIonian characters, whereof I could pick out but two words,(Greek), hog-teaching Minerva.The sky was clear before; but at that monster’s appearanceit changed so mightily for the worse that we were all amazedat it. As soon as the Chitterlings perceived the flying hog,down they all threw their weapons and fell on their knees,lifting up their hands joined together, without speaking oneword, in a posture of adoration. Friar John and his partykept on mincing, felling, braining, mangling, and spittingthe Chitterlings like mad; but Pantagruel sounded a retreat,and all hostility ceased.The monster having several times hovered backwards andforwards between the two armies, with a tail-shot voidedabove twenty-seven butts of mustard on the ground; thenflew away through the air, crying all the while, Carnival,Carnival, Carnival.Chapter 4.XLII.Chapter 4.XLII.Chapter 4.XLII.Chapter 4.XLII.Chapter 4.XLII.HHHHHooooow Pw Pw Pw Pw Pantagrantagrantagrantagrantagruel held a truel held a truel held a truel held a truel held a treaty with Neaty with Neaty with Neaty with Neaty with Niphleseth,iphleseth,iphleseth,iphleseth,iphleseth,QQQQQueen of the Chitterlings.ueen of the Chitterlings.ueen of the Chitterlings.ueen of the Chitterlings.ueen of the Chitterlings.The monster being out of sight, and the two armies remain-ing silent, Pantagruel demanded a parley with the lady"},{"pageNumber":617,"pageContent":"617RabelaisNiphleseth, Queen of the Chitterlings, who was in her chariotby the standards; and it was easily granted.

They liveon nothing but wind, eat nothing but wind, and drink noth-ing but wind. They have no other houses but weathercocks.They sow no other seeds but the three sorts of windflowers,rue, and herbs that may make one break wind to the pur-pose; these scour them off carefully. The common sort ofpeople to feed themselves make use of feather, paper, or linenfans, according to their abilities. As for the rich, they live bythe means of windmills.When they would have some noble treat, the tables arespread under one or two windmills. There they feast as merryas beggars, and during the meal their whole talk is commonlyof the goodness, excellency, salubrity, and rarity of winds; asyou, jolly topers, in your cups philosophize and argue uponwines. The one praises the south-east, the other the south-west; this the west and by south, and this the east and bynorth; another the west, and another the east; and so of therest. As for lovers and amorous sparks, no gale for them likea smock-gale. For the sick they use bellows as we use clystersamong us.Oh! said to me a little diminutive swollen bubble, that Ihad now but a bladderful of that same Languedoc wind whichthey call Cierce. The famous physician, Scurron, passing oneday by this country, was telling us that it is so strong that itwill make nothing of overturning a loaded waggon.

Not knowing the cause ofhis anger, at first I thought that all this was by the doctor’sadvice, as being a thing very healthy to the master to be in apassion and to his man to be banged for it. But at last I heardhim taxing his man with stealing from him, like a rogue ashe was, the better half of a large leathern bag of an excellentsoutherly wind, which he had carefully laid up, like a hiddenreserve, against the cold weather.They neither exonerate, dung, piss, nor spit in that island;but, to make amends, they belch, fizzle, funk, and give tail-shots in abundance. They are troubled with all manner ofdistempers; and, indeed, all distempers are engendered andproceed from ventosities, as Hippocrates demonstrates, lib.De Flatibus. But the most epidemical among them is thewind-cholic. The remedies which they use are large clysters,whereby they void store of windiness. They all die of drop-sies and tympanies, the men farting and the women fizzling;so that their soul takes her leave at the back-door.Some time after, walking in the island, we met threehairbrained airy fellows, who seemed mightily puffed up,and went to take their pastime and view the plovers, wholive on the same diet as themselves, and abound in the is-land. I observed that, as your true topers when they travelcarry flasks, leathern bottles, and small runlets along withthem, so each of them had at his girdle a pretty little pair ofbellows. If they happened to want wind, by the help of thosepretty bellows they immediately drew some, fresh and cool,by attraction and reciprocal expulsion; for, as you well know,wind essentially defined is nothing but fluctuating and agi-tated air.A while after, we were commanded, in the king’s name,not to receive for three hours any man or woman of thecountry on board our ships; some having stolen from him arousing fart, of the very individual wind which old goodmanAeolus the snorer gave Ulysses to conduct his ship wheneverit should happen to be becalmed.

True, sir, returned the mayor;but, alas! nothing is perfect here below; for too often whenwe are at table, feeding on some good blessed wind of Godas on celestial manna, merry as so many friars, down dropson a sudden some small rain, which lays our wind, and sorobs us of it. Thus many a meal’s lost for want of meat.Just so, quoth Panurge, Jenin Toss-pot of Quinquenais,evacuating some wine of his own burning on his wife’s pos-teriors, laid the ill-fumed wind that blowed out of their cen-tre as out of some magisterial Aeolipile.

By the advice of our Mezarims, replied the mayor,about the time that he uses to give us a visit, we garrison ourwindmills with good store of cocks and hens. The first timethat the greedy thief swallowed them, they had like to havedone his business at once; for they crowed and cackled in hismaw, and fluttered up and down athwart and along in hisstomach, which threw the glutton into a lipothymy cardiacpassion and dreadful and dangerous convulsions, as if someserpent, creeping in at his mouth, had been frisking in hisstomach.Here is a comparative as altogether incongruous and im-pertinent, cried Friar John, interrupting them; for I have for-merly heard that if a serpent chance to get into a man’s stom-ach it will not do him the least hurt, but will immediatelyget out if you do but hang the patient by the heels and lay apanful of warm milk near his mouth. You were told this,said Pantagruel, and so were those who gave you this ac-count; but none ever saw or read of such a cure. On thecontrary, Hippocrates, in his fifth book of Epidem, writesthat such a case happening in his time the patient presentlydied of a spasm and convulsion.Besides the cocks and hens, said the mayor, continuing hisstory, all the foxes in the country whipped into Wide-nostril’smouth, posting after the poultry; which made such a stirwith Reynard at their heels, that he grievously fell into fitseach minute of an hour.At last, by the advice of a Baden enchanter, at the time ofthe paroxysm he used to flay a fox by way of antidote andcounter-poison. Since that he took better advice, and easeshimself with taking a clyster made with a decoction of wheatand barley corns, and of livers of goslings; to the first of whichthe poultry run, and the foxes to the latter. Besides, he swal-lows some of your badgers or fox-dogs by the way of pillsand boluses. This is our misfortune.Cease to fear, good people, cried Pantagruel; this hugeWide-nostrils, this same swallower of windmills, is no more,I will assure you; he died, being stifled and choked with alump of fresh butter at the mouth of a hot oven, by the ad-vice of his physicians."},{"pageNumber":622,"pageContent":"622Gargantua & PantagruelChapter 4.XLChapter 4.XLChapter 4.XLChapter 4.XLChapter 4.XLVVVVV.....HHHHHooooow Pw Pw Pw Pw Pantagrantagrantagrantagrantagruel wuel wuel wuel wuel went ashorent ashorent ashorent ashorent ashore in the island of Pe in the island of Pe in the island of Pe in the island of Pe in the island of Pope-Fope-Fope-Fope-Fope-Figland.igland.igland.igland.igland.The next morning we arrived at the island of Pope-figs; for-merly a rich and free people, called the Gaillardets, but now,alas! miserably poor, and under the yoke of the Papimen.The occasion of it was this:On a certain yearly high holiday, and burgomaster, syndics,and topping rabbies of the Gaillardets chanced to go intothe neighbouring island Papimany to see the festival and passaway the time.

Now Frederick being returned, mas-tered them, and caused so careful a search to be made thathe found out and got the famous mule Thacor.

Since this, the poor wretches neverprospered, but every year the devil was at their doors, andthey were plagued with hail, storms, famine, and all mannerof woes, as an everlasting punishment for the sin of theirancestors and relations. Perceiving the misery and calamityof that generation, we did not care to go further up into thecountry, contenting ourselves with going into a little chapelnear the haven to take some holy water. It was dilapidatedand ruined, wanting also a cover—like Saint Peter at Rome.When we were in, as we dipped our fingers in the sanctifiedcistern, we spied in the middle of that holy pickle a fellowmuffled up with stoles, all under water, like a diving duck,except the tip of his snout to draw his breath.

Who? asked Pantagruel. You know who,answered they. Who is it? asked Friar John. ‘Sblood and‘ounds, I’ll thrash him thick and threefold. This he said think-ing that they inquired after some robber, murderer, or church-breaker. Oh, wonderful! cried the four; do not you foreignpeople know the one? Sirs, replied Epistemon, we do notunderstand those terms; but if you will be pleased to let usknow who you mean, we will tell you the truth of the matterwithout any more ado. We mean, said they, he that is. Didyou ever see him? He that is, returned Pantagruel, accordingto our theological doctrine, is God, who said to Moses, I amthat I am. We never saw him, nor can he be beheld by mor-tal eyes. We mean nothing less than that supreme God whorules in heaven, replied they; we mean the god on earth. Didyou ever see him? Upon my honour, replied Carpalin, theymean the pope. Ay, ay, answered Panurge; yea, verily, gentle-men, I have seen three of them, whose sight has not muchbettered me. How! cried they, our sacred decretals inform usthat there never is more than one living. I mean successively,one after the other, returned Panurge; otherwise I never sawmore than one at a time.O thrice and four times happy people! cried they; you arewelcome, and more than double welcome! They then kneeleddown before us and would have kissed our feet, but we wouldnot suffer it, telling them that should the pope come thitherin his own person, ’tis all they could do to him. No, cer-tainly, answered they, for we have already resolved upon thematter. We would kiss his bare arse without boggling at it,and eke his two pounders; for he has a pair of them, the holyfather, that he has; we find it so by our fine decretals, other-"},{"pageNumber":630,"pageContent":"630Gargantua & Pantagruelwise he could not be pope. So that, according to our subtledecretaline philosophy, this is a necessary consequence: he ispope; therefore he has genitories, and should genitories nomore be found in the world, the world could no more have apope.While they were talking thus, Pantagruel inquired of oneof the coxswain’s crew who those persons were. He answeredthat they were the four estates of the island, and added thatwe should be made as welcome as princes, since we had seenthe pope. Panurge having been acquainted with this byPantagruel, said to him in his ear, I swear and vow, sir, ’tiseven so; he that has patience may compass anything. Seeingthe pope had done us no good; now, in the devil’s name,‘twill do us a great deal. We then went ashore, and the wholecountry, men, women, and children, came to meet us as in asolemn procession. Our four estates cried out to them with aloud voice, They have seen him! they have seen him! theyhave seen him! That proclamation being made, all the mobkneeled before us, lifting up their hands towards heaven, andcrying, O happy men! O most happy! and this acclamationlasted above a quarter of an hour.Then came the Busby (!) of the place, with all his peda-gogues, ushers, and schoolboys, whom he magisteriallyflogged, as they used to whip children in our country for-merly when some criminal was hanged, that they might re-member it. This displeased Pantagruel, who said to them,Gentlemen, if you do not leave off whipping these poor chil-dren, I am gone. The people were amazed, hearing his sten-torian voice; and I saw a little hump with long fingers say tothe hypodidascal, What, in the name of wonder! do all thosethat see the pope grow as tall as yon huge fellow that threat-ens us? Ah! how I shall think time long till I have seen himtoo, that I may grow and look as big. In short, the acclama-tions were so great that Homenas (so they called their bishop)hastened thither on an unbridled mule with green trappings,attended by his apposts (as they said) and his supposts, orofficers bearing crosses, banners, standards, canopies, torches,holy-water pots, &c. He too wanted to kiss our feet (as thegood Christian Valfinier did to Pope Clement), saying thatone of their hypothetes, that’s one of the scavengers, scourers,and commentators of their holy decretals, had written that,in the same manner as the Messiah, so long and so much"},{"pageNumber":631,"pageContent":"631Rabelaisexpected by the Jews, at last appeared among them; so, onsome happy day of God, the pope would come into thatisland; and that, while they waited for that blessed time, ifany who had seen him at Rome or elsewhere chanced tocome among them, they should be sure to make much ofthem, feast them plentifully, and treat them with a great dealof reverence.

Therefore,not to decline that fine institution, let us go to church; wewill afterwards go and feast ourselves. Man of God, quothFriar John, do you go before, we’ll follow you. You spoke inthe matter properly, and like a good Christian; ’tis long sincewe saw any such. For my part, this rejoices my mind verymuch, and I verily believe that I shall have the better stom-ach after it. Well, ’tis a happy thing to meet with good men!Being come near the gate of the church, we spied a hugethick book, gilt, and covered all over with precious stones, asrubies, emeralds, (diamonds,) and pearls, more, or at least asvaluable as those which Augustus consecrated to JupiterCapitolinus. This book hanged in the air, being fastened withtwo thick chains of gold to the zoophore of the porch. Welooked on it and admired it. As for Pantagruel, he handled itand dandled it and turned it as he pleased, for he could reachit without straining; and he protested that whenever hetouched it, he was seized with a pleasant tickling at his fin-gers’ end, new life and activity in his arms, and a violenttemptation in his mind to beat one or two sergeants, or suchofficers, provided they were not of the shaveling kind.Homenas then said to us, The law was formerly given to theJews by Moses, written by God himself. At Delphos, beforethe portal of Apollo’s temple, this sentence, (Greek), wasfound written with a divine hand.

At Acropolis, near Athens, Minerva’sstatue formerly fell from the empyreal heaven. In like man-ner the sacred decretals which you see were written with thehand of an angel of the cherubim kind. You outlandish peoplewill hardly believe this, I fear. Little enough, of conscience,said Panurge. And then, continued Homenas, they weremiraculously transmitted to us here from the very heaven ofheavens; in the same manner as the river Nile is called Diipetesby Homer, the father of all philosophy—the holy decretalsalways excepted. Now, because you have seen the pope, theirevangelist and everlasting protector, we will give you leave tosee and kiss them on the inside, if you think meet. But thenyou must fast three days before, and canonically confess;nicely and strictly mustering up and inventorizing your sins,great and small, so thick that one single circumstance of themmay not escape you; as our holy decretals, which you see,direct. This will take up some time. Man of God, answeredPanurge, we have seen and descried decrees, and eke decretalsenough o’ conscience; some on paper, other on parchment,fine and gay like any painted paper lantern, some on vellum,some in manuscript, and others in print; so you need nottake half these pains to show us these. We’ll take the good-will for the deed, and thank you as much as if we had. Ay,marry, said Homenas, but you never saw these that are an-gelically written. Those in your country are only transcriptsfrom ours; as we find it written by one of our old decretalinescholiasts. For me, do not spare me; I do not value the labour,so I may serve you. Do but tell me whether you will be con-fessed and fast only three short little days of God? As forshriving, answered Panurge, there can be no great harm in’t;but this same fasting, master of mine, will hardly down withus at this time, for we have so very much overfasted our-selves at sea that the spiders have spun their cobwebs overour grinders.

The hour of midday ispast, and after it our sacred decretals forbid us to sing mass,I mean your high and lawful mass. But I’ll say a low and dryone for you. I had rather have one moistened with somegood Anjou wine, cried Panurge; fall to, fall to your low mass,and despatch. Ods-bodikins, quoth Friar John, it frets me tothe guts that I must have an empty stomach at this time ofday; for, had I eaten a good breakfast and fed like a monk, ifhe should chance to sing us the Requiem aeternam dona eis,Domine, I had then brought thither bread and wine for thetraits passes (those that are gone before).

Thus, said Friar John,at Seuille, the rascally beggars being one evening on a sol-emn holiday at supper in the spital, one bragged of havinggot six blancs, or twopence halfpenny; another eight liards,or twopence; a third, seven caroluses, or sixpence; but an oldmumper made his vaunts of having got three testons, or fiveshillings. Ah, but, cried his comrades, thou hast a leg of God;as if, continued Friar John, some divine virtue could lie hidin a stinking ulcerated rotten shank. Pray, said Pantagruel,when you are for telling us some such nauseous tale, be sokind as not to forget to provide a basin, Friar John; I’ll assureyou, I had much ado to forbear bringing up my breakfast.Fie! I wonder a man of your coat is not ashamed to use thusthe sacred name of God in speaking of things so filthy andabominable! fie, I say. If among your monking tribes suchan abuse of words is allowed, I beseech you leave it there,and do not let it come out of the cloisters. Physicians, saidEpistemon, thus attribute a kind of divinity to some dis-eases. Nero also extolled mushrooms, and, in a Greek prov-erb, termed them divine food, because with them he hadpoisoned Claudius his predecessor. But methinks, gentlemen,this same picture is not over-like our late popes. For I haveseen them, not with their pallium, amice, or rochet on, butwith helmets on their heads, more like the top of a Persianturban; and while the Christian commonwealth was in peace,they alone were most furiously and cruelly making war. Thismust have been then, returned Homenas, against the rebel-lious, heretical Protestants; reprobates who are disobedientto the holiness of this good god on earth. ’Tis not only law-ful for him to do so, but it is enjoined him by the sacreddecretals; and if any dare transgress one single iota against"},{"pageNumber":635,"pageContent":"635Rabelaistheir commands, whether they be emperors, kings, dukes,princes, or commonwealths, he is immediately to pursue themwith fire and sword, strip them of all their goods, take theirkingdoms from them, proscribe them, anathematize them, anddestroy not only their bodies, those of their children, rela-tions, and others, but damn also their souls to the very bot-tom of the most hot and burning cauldron in hell.

Immediately one of the girls broughthim a tall-boy brimful of extravagant wine.

When he had tipped that off, and giventhe tall-boy to the pretty creature, he lifted up his voice andsaid, O most holy decretals, how good is good wine foundthrough your means! This is the best jest we have had yet,observed Panurge. But it would still be a better, saidPantagruel, if they could turn bad wine into good.O seraphic Sextum! continued Homenas, how necessaryare you not to the salvation of poor mortals!

May Inever stir, if whatever was lapped up in them was not imme-diately corrupted, rotten, and spoiled; incense, pepper, cloves,cinnamon, saffron, wax, cassia, rhubarb, tamarinds, all drugsand spices, were lost without exception. Mark, mark, quothHomenas, an effect of divine justice! This comes of puttingthe sacred Scriptures to such profane uses.At Paris, said Carpalin, Snip Groignet the tailor had turnedan old Clementinae into patterns and measures, and all theclothes that were cut on them were utterly spoiled and lost;gowns, hoods, cloaks, cassocks, jerkins, jackets, waistcoats,capes, doublets, petticoats, corps de robes, farthingales, andso forth. Snip, thinking to cut a hood, would cut you out acodpiece; instead of a cassock he would make you a high-crowned hat; for a waistcoat he’d shape you out a rochet; onthe pattern of a doublet he’d make you a thing like a frying-pan. Then his journeymen having stitched it up did jag itand pink it at the bottom, and so it looked like a pan to frychestnuts.

Now I sell, nay, I giveand bequeath for ever and aye, the mould of my doublet tofifteen hundred hampers full of black devils, if ever any ar-cher in the country (though they are singular marksmen inGuienne) could hit the white.

While he said this,the maidens began to snicker at his elbow, grinning, gig-gling, and twittering among themselves. Friar John began topaw, neigh, and whinny at the snout’s end, as one ready toleap, or at least to play the ass, and get up and ride tantivy tothe devil like a beggar on horseback.Methinks, said Pantagruel, a man might have been moreout of danger near the white of which Gymnast spoke thanwas formerly Diogenes near another.

After supper several farces, interludes, and comical sceneswere acted; they had also several morris-dancers with bellsand tabors, and divers sorts of masks and mummers were letin. My schoolfellows and I, to grace the festival to the best ofour power (for fine white and purple liveries had been givento all of us in the morning), contrived a merry mask withstore of cockle-shells, shells of snails, periwinkles, and suchother. Then for want of cuckoo-pint, or priest-pintle,lousebur, clote, and paper, we made ourselves false faces withthe leaves of an old Sextum that had been thrown by and laythere for anyone that would take it up, cutting out holes forthe eyes, nose, and mouth. Now, did you ever hear the likesince you were born? When we had played our little boyishantic tricks, and came to take off our sham faces, we ap-peared more hideous and ugly than the little devils that actedthe Passion at Douay; for our faces were utterly spoiled atthe places which had been touched by those leaves.

Methinks I hearsome people talking in the air, yet I can see nobody. Hark!According to his command we listened, and with full earssucked in the air as some of you suck oysters, to find if wecould hear some sound scattered through the sky; and tolose none of it, like the Emperor Antoninus some of us laidtheir hands hollow next to their ears; but all this would notdo, nor could we hear any voice. Yet Pantagruel continuedto assure us he heard various voices in the air, some of men,and some of women.At last we began to fancy that we also heard something, orat least that our ears tingled; and the more we listened, theplainer we discerned the voices, so as to distinguish articu-late sounds. This mightily frightened us, and not withoutcause; since we could see nothing, yet heard such varioussounds and voices of men, women, children, horses, &c.,insomuch that Panurge cried out, Cods-belly, there is no fool-ing with the devil; we are all beshit, let’s fly.

At least let us retreat to the leeward. Helma-lee; bring the main-tack aboard, haul the bowlines, hoistthe top-gallants. We are all dead men; get off, in the devil’sname, get off.Pantagruel, hearing the sad outcry which Panurge made,said, Who talks of flying? Let’s first see who they are; per-haps they may be friends. I can discover nobody yet, thoughI can see a hundred miles round me. But let’s consider alittle. I have read that a philosopher named Petron was ofopinion that there were several worlds that touched each otherin an equilateral triangle; in whose centre, he said, was thedwelling of truth; and that the words, ideas, copies, and im-ages of all things past and to come resided there; round whichwas the age; and that with success of time part of them usedto fall on mankind like rheums and mildews, just as the dewfell on Gideon’s fleece, till the age was fulfilled.I also remember, continued he, that Aristotle affirmsHomer’s words to be flying, moving, and consequently ani-mated. Besides, Antiphanes said that Plato’s philosophy waslike words which, being spoken in some country during ahard winter, are immediately congealed, frozen up, and notheard; for what Plato taught young lads could hardly be un-derstood by them when they were grown old. Now, contin-ued he, we should philosophize and search whether this benot the place where those words are thawed.You would wonder very much should this be the head andlyre of Orpheus. When the Thracian women had torn himto pieces they threw his head and lyre into the river Hebrus,down which they floated to the Euxine sea as far as the is-land of Lesbos; the head continually uttering a doleful song,as it were lamenting the death of Orpheus, and the lyre, withthe wind’s impulse moving its strings and harmoniously ac-companying the voice.

Ibelieve him. But couldn’t we see some of ‘em? I think I haveread that, on the edge of the mountain on which Moses re-ceived the Judaic law, the people saw the voices sensibly. Here,here, said Pantagruel, here are some that are not yet thawed.He then threw us on the deck whole handfuls of frozen words,which seemed to us like your rough sugar-plums, of manycolours, like those used in heraldry; some words gules (thismeans also jests and merry sayings), some vert, some azure,some black, some or (this means also fair words); and whenwe had somewhat warmed them between our hands, theymelted like snow, and we really heard them, but could notunderstand them, for it was a barbarous gibberish. One ofthem only, that was pretty big, having been warmed betweenFriar John’s hands, gave a sound much like that of chestnutswhen they are thrown into the fire without being first cut,which made us all start. This was the report of a field-piecein its time, cried Friar John.Panurge prayed Pantagruel to give him some more; butPantagruel told him that to give words was the part of a lover.Sell me some then, I pray you, cried Panurge.

I would sooner sell you si-lence, though at a dearer rate; as Demosthenes formerly soldit by the means of his argentangina, or silver squinsy.However, he threw three or four handfuls of them on thedeck; among which I perceived some very sharp words, andsome bloody words, which the pilot said used sometimes to"},{"pageNumber":649,"pageContent":"649Rabelaisgo back and recoil to the place whence they came, but it waswith a slit weasand.

This caused the friar to threaten him with such apiece of revenge as was put upon G.

This,however, with submission to better judgments. The ruler ofthis place was one Master Gaster, the first master of arts inthis world. For, if you believe that fire is the great master ofarts, as Tully writes, you very much wrong him and yourself;alas! Tully never believed this. On the other side, if you fancyMercury to be the first inventor of arts, as our ancient Dru-ids believed of old, you are mightily beside the mark. Thesatirist’s sentence, that affirms Master Gaster to be the mas-ter of all arts, is true. With him peacefully resided old goodyPenia, alias Poverty, the mother of the ninety-nine Muses,on whom Porus, the lord of Plenty, formerly begot Love,that noble child, the mediator of heaven and earth, as Platoaffirms in Symposio.We were all obliged to pay our homage and swear alle-giance to that mighty sovereign; for he is imperious, severe,blunt, hard, uneasy, inflexible; you cannot make him be-lieve, represent to him, or persuade him anything.He does not hear; and as the Egyptians said thatHarpocrates, the god of silence, named Sigalion in Greek,was astome, that is, without a mouth, so Gaster was createdwithout ears, even like the image of Jupiter in Candia.He only speaks by signs, but those signs are more readilyobeyed by everyone than the statutes of senates or commandsof monarchs.

Needs must when the devildrives; there’s no gainsaying of it.The pilot was telling us how, on a certain time, after themanner of the members that mutinied against the belly, asAesop describes it, the whole kingdom of the Somates wentoff into a direct faction against Gaster, resolving to throw offhis yoke; but they soon found their mistake, and most hum-bly submitted, for otherwise they had all been famished.What company soever he is in, none dispute with him forprecedence or superiority; he still goes first, though kings,emperors, or even the pope, were there. So he held the firstplace at the council of Basle; though some will tell you thatthe council was tumultuous by the contention and ambitionof many for priority.Everyone is busied and labours to serve him, and indeed,to make amends for this, he does this good to mankind, asto invent for them all arts, machines, trades, engines, andcrafts; he even instructs brutes in arts which are against theirnature, making poets of ravens, jackdaws, chattering jays,parrots, and starlings, and poetesses of magpies, teachingthem to utter human language, speak, and sing; and all forthe gut. He reclaims and tames eagles, gerfalcons, falconsgentle, sakers, lanners, goshawks, sparrowhawks, merlins,haggards, passengers, wild rapacious birds; so that, settingthem free in the air whenever he thinks fit, as high and aslong as he pleases, he keeps them suspended, straying, fly-ing, hovering, and courting him above the clouds.

The first were calledEngastrimythes; the others, Gastrolaters.The first pretended to be descended of the ancient race ofEurycles, and for this brought the authority of Aristophanesin his comedy called the Wasps; whence of old they werecalled Euryclians, as Plato writes, and Plutarch in his bookof the Cessation of Oracles. In the holy decrees, 26, qu. 3,they are styled Ventriloqui; and the same name is given themin Ionian by Hippocrates, in his fifth book of Epid., as menwho speak from the belly. Sophocles calls them Sternomantes.These were soothsayers, enchanters, cheats, who gulled themob, and seemed not to speak and give answers from themouth, but from the belly.Such a one, about the year of our Lord 1513, was JacobaRodogina, an Italian woman of mean extract; from whosebelly we, as well as an infinite number of others at Ferraraand elsewhere, have often heard the voice of the evil spiritspeak, low, feeble, and small, indeed, but yet very distinct,articulate, and intelligible, when she was sent for out of curi-osity by the lords and princes of the Cisalpine Gaul.

Nay, some-times he seemed to own his ignorance, instead of an answerletting out a rousing fart, or muttering some words with bar-barous and uncouth inflexions, and not to be understood.As for the Gastrolaters, they stuck close to one another inknots and gangs. Some of them merry, wanton, and soft asso many milk-sops; others louring, grim, dogged, demure,and crabbed; all idle, mortal foes to business, spending halftheir time in sleeping and the rest in doing nothing, a rent-charge and dead unnecessary weight on the earth, as Hesiodsaith; afraid, as we judged, of offending or lessening theirpaunch. Others were masked, disguised, and so oddly dressedthat it would have done you good to have seen them.There’s a saying, and several ancient sages write, that theskill of nature appears wonderful in the pleasure which sheseems to have taken in the configuration of sea-shells, sogreat is their variety in figures, colours, streaks, and inimi-table shapes.

You knowthat, by the institution of nature, bread has been assignedhim for provision and food; and that, as an addition to thisblessing, he should never want the means to get bread.Accordingly, from the beginning he invented the smith’sart, and husbandry to manure the ground, that it might yieldhim corn; he invented arms and the art of war to defendcorn; physic and astronomy, with other parts of mathemat-ics which might be useful to keep corn a great number ofyears in safety from the injuries of the air, beasts, robbers,and purloiners; he invented water, wind, and handmills, anda thousand other engines to grind corn and to turn it intomeal; leaven to make the dough ferment, and the use of saltto give it a savour; for he knew that nothing bred more dis-eases than heavy, unleavened, unsavoury bread.He found a way to get fire to bake it; hour-glasses, dials,and clocks to mark the time of its baking; and as some coun-tries wanted corn, he contrived means to convey some outof one country into another.He had the wit to pimp for asses and mares, animals ofdifferent species, that they might copulate for the genera-tion of a third, which we call mules, more strong and fit forhard service than the other two. He invented carts andwaggons to draw him along with greater ease; and as seasand rivers hindered his progress, he devised boats, galleys,and ships (to the astonishment of the elements) to waft himover to barbarous, unknown, and far distant nations, thence"},{"pageNumber":663,"pageContent":"663Rabelaisto bring, or thither to carry corn.Besides, seeing that when he had tilled the ground, someyears the corn perished in it for want of rain in due season,in others rotted or was drowned by its excess, sometimesspoiled by hail, eat by worms in the ear, or beaten down bystorms, and so his stock was destroyed on the ground; wewere told that ever since the days of yore he has found out away to conjure the rain down from heaven only with cuttingcertain grass, common enough in the field, yet known tovery few, some of which was then shown us. I took it to bethe same as the plant, one of whose boughs being dipped byJove’s priest in the Agrian fountain on the Lycian mountainin Arcadia, in time of drought raised vapours which gath-ered into clouds, and then dissolved into rain that kindlymoistened the whole country.Our master of arts was also said to have found a way tokeep the rain up in the air, and make it to fall into the sea;also to annihilate the hail, suppress the winds, and removestorms as the Methanensians of Troezene used to do. And asin the fields thieves and plunderers sometimes stole and tookby force the corn and bread which others had toiled to get,he invented the art of building towns, forts, and castles, tohoard and secure that staff of life. On the other hand, find-ing none in the fields, and hearing that it was hoarded upand secured in towns, forts, and castles, and watched withmore care than ever were the golden pippins of theHesperides, he turned engineer, and found ways to beat,storm, and demolish forts and castles with machines andwarlike thunderbolts, battering-rams, ballists, and catapults,whose shapes were shown to us, not over-well understoodby our engineers, architects, and other disciples of Vitruvius;as Master Philibert de l’Orme, King Megistus’s principal ar-chitect, has owned to us.And seeing that sometimes all these tools of destructionwere baffled by the cunning subtlety or the subtle cunning(which you please) of fortifiers, he lately invented cannons,field-pieces, culverins, bombards, basiliskos, murdering in-struments that dart iron, leaden, and brazen balls, some ofthem outweighing huge anvils.

He showed usa trial of this which has been since used by Fronton, and isnow common among the pastimes and harmless recreationsof the Thelemites. I will tell you how he went to work, andpray for the future be a little more ready to believe whatPlutarch affirms to have tried. Suppose a herd of goats wereall scampering as if the devil drove them, do but put a bit oferingo into the mouth of the hindmost nanny, and they willall stop stock still in the time you can tell three.Thus Gaster, having caused a brass falcon to be chargedwith a sufficient quantity of gunpowder well purged from itssulphur, and curiously made up with fine camphor, he thenhad a suitable ball put into the piece, with twenty-four littlepellets like hail-shot, some round, some pearl fashion; thentaking his aim and levelling it at a page of his, as if he wouldhave hit him on the breast. About sixty strides off the piece,halfway between it and the page in a right line, he hangedon a gibbet by a rope a very large siderite or iron-like stone,otherwise called herculean, formerly found on Ida in Phrygiaby one Magnes, as Nicander writes, and commonly calledloadstone; then he gave fire to the prime on the piece’s touch-hole, which in an instant consuming the powder, the ball"},{"pageNumber":665,"pageContent":"665Rabelaisand hail-shot were with incredible violence and swiftnesshurried out of the gun at its muzzle, that the air might pen-etrate to its chamber, where otherwise would have been avacuum, which nature abhors so much, that this universalmachine, heaven, air, land, and sea, would sooner return tothe primitive chaos than admit the least void anywhere. Nowthe ball and small shot, which threatened the page with noless than quick destruction, lost their impetuosity and re-mained suspended and hovering round the stone; nor didany of them, notwithstanding the fury with which theyrushed, reach the page.Master Gaster could do more than all this yet, if you willbelieve me; for he invented a way how to cause bullets to flybackwards, and recoil on those that sent them with as great aforce, and in the very numerical parallel for which the gunswere planted. And indeed, why should he have thought thisdifficult? seeing the herb ethiopis opens all locks whatsoever,and an echinus or remora, a silly weakly fish, in spite of allthe winds that blow from the thirty-two points of the com-pass, will in the midst of a hurricane make you the biggestfirst-rate remain stock still, as if she were becalmed or theblustering tribe had blown their last. Nay, and with the fleshof that fish, preserved with salt, you may fish gold out of thedeepest well that was ever sounded with a plummet; for itwill certainly draw up the precious metal, since Democritusaffirmed it. Theophrastus believed and experienced that therewas an herb at whose single touch an iron wedge, thoughnever so far driven into a huge log of the hardest wood thatis, would presently come out; and it is this same herb yourhickways, alias woodpeckers, use, when with some mightyaxe anyone stops up the hole of their nests, which they in-dustriously dig and make in the trunk of some sturdy tree.Since stags and hinds, when deeply wounded with darts, ar-rows, and bolts, if they do but meet the herb called dittany,which is common in Candia, and eat a little of it, presentlythe shafts come out and all is well again; even as kind Venuscured her beloved byblow Aeneas when he was wounded onthe right thigh with an arrow by Juturna, Turnus’s sister.

In short, since elders grow of a morepleasing sound, and fitter to make flutes, in such places wherethe crowing of cocks is not heard, as the ancient sages havewrit and Theophrastus relates; as if the crowing of a cockdulled, flattened, and perverted the wood of the elder, as it issaid to astonish and stupify with fear that strong and reso-lute animal, a lion. I know that some have understood thisof wild elder, that grows so far from towns or villages thatthe crowing of cocks cannot reach near it; and doubtless thatsort ought to be preferred to the stenching common elderthat grows about decayed and ruined places; but others haveunderstood this in a higher sense, not literal, but allegorical,according to the method of the Pythagoreans, as when it wassaid that Mercury’s statue could not be made of every sort ofwood; to which sentence they gave this sense, that God isnot to be worshipped in a vulgar form, but in a chosen andreligious manner. In the same manner, by this elder whichgrows far from places where cocks are heard, the ancientsmeant that the wise and studious ought not to give theirminds to trivial or vulgar music, but to that which is celes-tial, divine, angelical, more abstracted, and brought fromremoter parts, that is, from a region where the crowing ofcocks is not heard; for, to denote a solitary and unfrequentedplace, we say cocks are never heard to crow there.Chapter 4.LXIII.Chapter 4.LXIII.Chapter 4.LXIII.Chapter 4.LXIII.Chapter 4.LXIII.HHHHHooooow Pw Pw Pw Pw Pantagrantagrantagrantagrantagruel fell asleep near the island of Chaneph, anduel fell asleep near the island of Chaneph, anduel fell asleep near the island of Chaneph, anduel fell asleep near the island of Chaneph, anduel fell asleep near the island of Chaneph, andof the prof the prof the prof the prof the problems problems problems problems problems proposed to be solvoposed to be solvoposed to be solvoposed to be solvoposed to be solved when he waked.ed when he waked.ed when he waked.ed when he waked.ed when he waked.The next day, merrily pursuing our voyage, we came in sightof the island of Chaneph, where Pantagruel’s ship could notarrive, the wind chopping about, and then failing us so thatwe were becalmed, and could hardly get ahead, tacking aboutfrom starboard to larboard, and larboard to starboard, thoughto our sails we added drabblers."},{"pageNumber":667,"pageContent":"667RabelaisWith this accident we were all out of sorts, moping, droop-ing, metagrabolized, as dull as dun in the mire, in C sol fa utflat, out of tune, off the hinges, and I-don’t-know-howish,without caring to speak one single syllable to each other.Pantagruel was taking a nap, slumbering and nodding onthe quarter-deck by the cuddy, with an Heliodorus in hishand; for still it was his custom to sleep better by book thanby heart.Epistemon was conjuring, with his astrolabe, to know whatlatitude we were in.Friar John was got into the cook-room, examining, by theascendant of the spits and the horoscope of ragouts and fric-assees, what time of day it might then be.Panurge (sweet baby!) held a stalk of Pantagruelions, aliashemp, next his tongue, and with it made pretty bubbles andbladders.Gymnast was making tooth-pickers with lentisk.Ponocrates, dozing, dozed, and dreaming, dreamed; tick-led himself to make himself laugh, and with one fingerscratched his noddle where it did not itch.Carpalin, with a nutshell and a trencher of verne (that’s acard in Gascony), was making a pretty little merry windmill,cutting the card longways into four slips, and fastening themwith a pin to the convex of the nut, and its concave to thetarred side of the gunnel of the ship.Eusthenes, bestriding one of the guns, was playing on itwith his fingers as if it had been a trump-marine.Rhizotome, with the soft coat of a field tortoise, aliasycleped a mole, was making himself a velvet purse.Xenomanes was patching up an old weather-beaten lan-tern with a hawk’s jesses.Our pilot (good man!) was pulling maggots out of theseamen’s noses.At last Friar John, returning from the forecastle, perceivedthat Pantagruel was awake.

For my part, I know what I do when I drink; and itis a true thing (though ’tis in your Euripides) that is said bythat jolly toper Silenus of blessed memory, that— The man’s emphatically mad, Who drinks the best, yet can be sad.We must not fail to return our humble and hearty thanks tothe Being who, with this good bread, this cool delicious wine,these good meats and rare dainties, removes from our bodiesand minds these pains and perturbations, and at the sametime fills us with pleasure and with food.But methinks, sir, you did not give an answer to Friar John’squestion; which, as I take it, was how to raise good weather.Since you ask no more than this easy question, answeredPantagruel, I’ll strive to give you satisfaction; and some othertime we’ll talk of the rest of the problems, if you will.Well then, Friar John asked how good weather might beraised. Have we not raised it? Look up and see our full top-sails. Hark how the wind whistles through the shrouds, whata stiff gale it blows. Observe the rattling of the tacklings, andsee the sheets that fasten the mainsail behind; the force ofthe wind puts them upon the stretch. While we passed ourtime merrily, the dull weather also passed away; and whilewe raised the glasses to our mouths, we also raised the windby a secret sympathy in nature.Thus Atlas and Hercules clubbed to raise and underpropthe falling sky, if you’ll believe the wise mythologists, butthey raised it some half an inch too high, Atlas to entertainhis guest Hercules more pleasantly, and Hercules to makehimself amends for the thirst which some time before hadtormented him in the deserts of Africa. Your good father,said Friar John, interrupting him, takes care to free manypeople from such an inconveniency; for I have been told bymany venerable doctors that his chief-butler, Turelupin, savesabove eighteen hundred pipes of wine yearly to make ser-vants, and all comers and goers, drink before they are a-dry.As the camels and dromedaries of a caravan, continuedPantagruel, use to drink for the thirst that’s past, for thepresent, and for that to come, so did Hercules; and being"},{"pageNumber":675,"pageContent":"675Rabelaisthus excessively raised, this gave new motion to the sky, whichis that of titubation and trepidation, about which ourcrackbrained astrologers make such a pother. This, saidPanurge, makes the saying good: While jolly companions carouse it together, A fig for the storm, it gives way to good weather.Nay, continued Pantagruel, some will tell you that we havenot only shortened the time of the calm, but also muchdisburthened the ship; not like Aesop’s basket, by easing it ofthe provision, but by breaking our fasts; and that a man ismore terrestrial and heavy when fasting than when he haseaten and drank, even as they pretend that he weighs moredead than living. However it is, you will grant they are in theright who take their morning’s draught and breakfast beforea long journey; then say that the horses will perform thebetter, and that a spur in the head is worth two in the flank;or, in the same horse dialect— That a cup in the pate Is a mile in the gate.Don’t you know that formerly the Amycleans worshippedthe noble Bacchus above all other gods, and gave him thename of Psila, which in the Doric dialect signifies wings; for,as the birds raise themselves by a towering flight with theirwings above the clouds, so, with the help of soaring Bacchus,the powerful juice of the grape, our spirits are exalted to apitch above themselves, our bodies are more sprightly, andtheir earthly parts become soft and pliant.Chapter 4.LXVI.Chapter 4.LXVI.Chapter 4.LXVI.Chapter 4.LXVI.Chapter 4.LXVI.HHHHHooooowwwww, b, b, b, b, by Py Py Py Py Pantagrantagrantagrantagrantagruelueluelueluel’’’’’s ors ors ors ors orderderderderder, the M, the M, the M, the M, the Muses wuses wuses wuses wuses wererererere salutede salutede salutede salutede salutednear the isle of Gnear the isle of Gnear the isle of Gnear the isle of Gnear the isle of Ganabim.anabim.anabim.anabim.anabim.This fair wind and as fine talk brought us in sight of a highland, which Pantagruel discovering afar off, showed itXenomanes, and asked him, Do you see yonder to the lee-ward a high rock with two tops, much like Mount Parnassusin Phocis?

If thou art so afraid,dunghill, do not go; stay here and be hanged; or go and hidethy loggerhead under Madam Proserpine’s petticoat.Panurge hearing this, his breech began to make buttons;so he slunk in in an instant, and went to hide his head downin the bread-room among the musty biscuits and the ortsand scraps of broken bread.Pantagruel in the meantime said to the rest: I feel a press-"},{"pageNumber":677,"pageContent":"677Rabelaising retraction in my soul, which like a voice admonishes menot to land there.

Let’s hearken. When we werenearer, among the everlasting ringing of these indefatigablebells we heard the singing, as we thought, of some men. Forthis reason, before we offered to land on the Ringing Island,Pantagruel was of opinion that we should go in the pinnaceto a small rock, near which we discovered an hermitage anda little garden. There we found a diminutive old hermit,whose name was Braguibus, born at Glenay. He gave us afull account of all the jangling, and regaled us after a strangesort of fashion—four livelong days did he make us fast, as-suring us that we should not be admitted into the RingingIsland otherwise, because it was then one of the four fasting,or ember weeks. As I love my belly, quoth Panurge, I by nomeans understand this riddle. Methinks this should ratherbe one of the four windy weeks; for while we fast we are onlypuffed up with wind. Pray now, good father hermit, havenot you here some other pastime besides fasting? Methinksit is somewhat of the leanest; we might well enough be with-out so many palace holidays and those fasting times of yours.In my Donatus, quoth Friar John, I could find yet but threetimes or tenses, the preterit, the present, and the future;doubtless here the fourth ought to be a work of supereroga-tion. That time or tense, said Epistemon, is aorist, derivedfrom the preter-imperfect tense of the Greeks, admitted inwar (?) and odd cases. Patience perforce is a remedy for amad dog. Saith the hermit: It is, as I told you, fatal to goagainst this; whosoever does it is a rank heretic, and wantsnothing but fire and faggot, that’s certain. To deal plainlywith you, my dear pater, cried Panurge, being at sea, I muchmore fear being wet than being warm, and being drownedthan being burned.Well, however, let us fast, a God’s name; yet I have fastedso long that it has quite undermined my flesh, and I fearthat at last the bastions of this bodily fort of mine will fall toruin. Besides, I am much more afraid of vexing you in thissame trade of fasting; for the devil a bit I understand any-thing in it, and it becomes me very scurvily, as several peoplehave told me, and I am apt to believe them. For my part, I"},{"pageNumber":688,"pageContent":"688Gargantua & Pantagruelhave no great stomach to fasting; for alas! it is as easy aspissing a bed, and a trade of which anybody may set up;there needs no tools. I am much more inclined not to fastfor the future; for to do so there is some stock required, andsome tools are set a-work. No matter, since you are so stead-fast, and would have us fast, let us fast as fast as we can, andthen breakfast in the name of famine. Now we are come tothese esurial idle days. I vow I had quite put them out of myhead long ago. If we must fast, said Pantagruel, I see no otherremedy but to get rid of it as soon as we can, as we would outof a bad way. I’ll in that space of time somewhat look overmy papers, and examine whether the marine study be as goodas ours at land. For Plato, to describe a silly, raw, ignorantfellow, compares him to those that are bred on shipboard, aswe would do one bred up in a barrel, who never saw any-thing but through the bung-hole.To tell you the short and the long of the matter, our fast-ing was most hideous and terrible; for the first day we fastedon fisticuffs, the second at cudgels, the third at sharps, andthe fourth at blood and wounds: such was the order of thefairies.Chapter 5.II.Chapter 5.II.Chapter 5.II.Chapter 5.II.Chapter 5.II.HHHHHooooow the Ringing Iw the Ringing Iw the Ringing Iw the Ringing Iw the Ringing Island had been inhabited bsland had been inhabited bsland had been inhabited bsland had been inhabited bsland had been inhabited by they they they they theSSSSSiticines, who witicines, who witicines, who witicines, who witicines, who wererererere become bire become bire become bire become bire become birds.ds.ds.ds.ds.Having fasted as aforesaid, the hermit gave us a letter for onewhom he called Albian Camar, Master Aedituus of the Ring-ing Island; but Panurge greeting him called him MasterAntitus.

After thisthe devil a word could we get out of him but of birds andcages.The cages were spacious, costly, magnificent, and of anadmirable architecture. The birds were large, fine, and neataccordingly, looking as like the men in my country as onepea does like another; for they ate and drank like men, mutedlike men, endued or digested like men, farted like men, butstunk like devils; slept, billed, and trod their females likemen, but somewhat oftener: in short, had you seen and ex-amined them from top to toe, you would have laid yourhead to a turnip that they had been mere men. However,they were nothing less, as Master Aedituus told us; assuringus, at the same time, that they were neither secular nor laic;and the truth is, the diversity of their feathers and plumesdid not a little puzzle us.Some of them were all over as white as swans, others asblack as crows, many as grey as owls, others black and whitelike magpies, some all red like red-birds, and others purpleand white like some pigeons.

They are so hard-favoured and monstrous that none can abide them. For theirwry necks make a figure like a crooked billet; their paws arehairy, like those of rough-footed pigeons; their claws andpounces, belly and breech, like those of the Stymphalid har-pies.

He answered that such was the first institution and fataldestiny of the stars that the clerg-hawks begot the priest-hawks and monk-hawks without carnal copulation, as somebees are born of a young bull; the priest-hawks begat thebish-hawks, the bish-hawks the stately cardin-hawks, andthe stately cardin-hawks, if they live long enough, at last cometo be pope-hawk.Of this last kind there never is more than one at a time, asin a beehive there is but one king, and in the world is butone sun.When the pope-hawk dies, another arises in his stead out ofthe whole brood of cardin-hawks, that is, as you must under-stand it all along, without carnal copulation. So that there isin that species an individual unity, with a perpetuity of succes-sion, neither more or less than in the Arabian phoenix.’Tis true that, about two thousand seven hundred and sixtymoons ago, two pope-hawks were seen upon the face of theearth; but then you never saw in your lives such a woefulrout and hurly-burly as was all over this island.

He then gave half-a-dozen pulls to a little rope, which caused a diminutive bellto give so many ting-tangs; and presently a parcel of monk-hawks ran to him as if the devil had drove ‘em, and fell a-singing like mad.Pray, master, cried Panurge, if I also rang this bell could Imake those other birds yonder, with red-herring-colouredfeathers, sing? Ay, marry would you, returned Aedituus. Withthis Panurge hanged himself (by the hands, I mean) at thebell-rope’s end, and no sooner made it speak but those smokedbirds hied them thither and began to lift up their voices andmake a sort of untowardly hoarse noise, which I grudge tocall singing. Aedituus indeed told us that they fed on noth-ing but fish, like the herns and cormorants of the world, andthat they were a fifth kind of cucullati newly stamped.He added that he had been told by Robert Valbringue,who lately passed that way in his return from Africa, that asixth kind was to fly hither out of hand, which he calledcapus-hawks, more grum, vinegar-faced, brain-sick, froward,and loathsome than any kind whatsoever in the whole is-land.

I can hardly believe, contin-ued Aedituus, that their dams on t’other side the water gonine months with them; for they cannot endure them nineyears, nay, scarce seven sometimes, in the house, but by put-ting only a shirt over the other clothes of the young urchins,and lopping off I don’t well know how many hairs from theircrowns, mumbling certain apostrophized and expiatorywords, they visibly, openly, and plainly, by a Pythagoricalmetempsychosis, without the least hurt, transmogrify theminto such birds as you now see; much after the fashion of theEgyptian heathens, who used to constitute their isiacs byshaving them and making them put on certain linostoles, orsurplices.

Some do, answered Aedituus;formerly very few, very seldom, very late, and very unwill-ingly; however, since some certain eclipses, by the virtue ofthe celestial constellations, a great crowd of them fled backto the world. Nor do we fret or vex ourselves a jot about it;for those that stay wisely sing, The flower the better cheer;and all those that fly away, first cast off their feathers hereamong these nettles and briars.Accordingly we found some thrown by there; and as welooked up and down, we chanced to light on what somepeople will hardly thank us for having discovered; and therebyhangs a tale.Chapter 5.VChapter 5.VChapter 5.VChapter 5.VChapter 5.V.....OOOOOf the dumb Knight-hawks of the Ringing If the dumb Knight-hawks of the Ringing If the dumb Knight-hawks of the Ringing If the dumb Knight-hawks of the Ringing If the dumb Knight-hawks of the Ringing Island.sland.sland.sland.sland.These words were scarce out of his mouth when some five-and-twenty or thirty birds flew towards us; they were of ahue and feather like which we had not seen anything in the"},{"pageNumber":694,"pageContent":"694Gargantua & Pantagruelwhole island.

This same fashionable and illustrious disease, quothAedituus, is common among that kind of birds, because theyare pretty apt to be tossed on the salt deep.He then acquainted us with the occasion of their coming.This next to us, said he, looks so wistfully upon you to seewhether he may not find among your company a statelygaudy kind of huge dreadful birds of prey, which yet are sountoward that they ne’er could be brought to the lure nor toperch on the glove.

Non zelus, sed caritas.When day, peeping in the east, made the sky turn fromblack to red like a boiling lobster, he waked us again to takea dish of monastical brewis. From that time we made butone meal, that only lasted the whole day; so that I cannotwell tell how I may call it, whether dinner, supper, nunchion,or after-supper; only, to get a stomach, we took a turn or twoin the island, to see and hear the blessed singing-birds.At night Panurge said to Aedituus: Give me leave, sweetsir, to tell you a merry story of something that happenedsome three and twenty moons ago in the country ofChastelleraud.One day in April, a certain gentleman’s groom, Roger byname, was walking his master’s horses in some fallow ground.There ’twas his good fortune to find a pretty shepherdessfeeding her bleating sheep and harmless lambkins on thebrow of a neighbouring mountain, in the shade of an adja-cent grove; near her, some frisking kids tripped it over a greencarpet of nature’s own spreading, and, to complete the land-scape, there stood an ass. Roger, who was a wag, had a dishof chat with her, and after some ifs, ands, and buts, hemsand heighs on her side, got her in the mind to get up behindhim, to go and see his stable, and there take a bit by the byein a civil way. While they were holding a parley, the horse,directing his discourse to the ass (for all brute beasts spoke"},{"pageNumber":699,"pageContent":"699Rabelaisthat year in divers places), whispered these words in his ear:Poor ass, how I pity thee! thou slavest like any hack, I read iton thy crupper. Thou dost well, however, since God has cre-ated thee to serve mankind; thou art a very honest ass, butnot to be better rubbed down, currycombed, trapped, andfed than thou art, seems to me indeed to be too hard a lot.Alas! thou art all rough-coated, in ill plight, jaded, foun-dered, crestfallen, and drooping, like a mooting duck, andfeedest here on nothing but coarse grass, or briars and thistles.Therefore do but pace it along with me, and thou shalt seehow we noble steeds, made by nature for war, are treated.Come, thou’lt lose nothing by coming; I’ll get thee a taste ofmy fare. I’ troth, sir, I can but love you and thank you, re-turned the ass; I’ll wait on you, good Mr. Steed. Methinks,gaffer ass, you might as well have said Sir Grandpaw Steed.O! cry mercy, good Sir Grandpaw, returned the ass; we coun-try clowns are somewhat gross, and apt to knock words outof joint. However, an’t please you, I will come after yourworship at some distance, lest for taking this run my sideshould chance to be firked and curried with a vengeance, asit is but too often, the more is my sorrow.The shepherdess being got behind Roger, the ass followed,fully resolved to bait like a prince with Roger’s steed; butwhen they got to the stable, the groom, who spied the graveanimal, ordered one of his underlings to welcome him witha pitchfork and currycomb him with a cudgel. The ass, whoheard this, recommended himself mentally to the god Nep-tune, and was packing off, thinking and syllogizing withinhimself thus: Had not I been an ass, I had not come hereamong great lords, when I must needs be sensible that I wasonly made for the use of the small vulgar. Aesop had givenme a fair warning of this in one of his fables. Well, I muste’en scamper or take what follows. With this he fell a-trot-ting, and wincing, and yerking, and calcitrating, alias kick-ing, and farting, and funking, and curvetting, and bound-ing, and springing, and galloping full drive, as if the devilhad come for him in propria persona.The shepherdess, who saw her ass scour off, told Rogerthat it was her cattle, and desired he might be kindly used,or else she would not stir her foot over the threshold.

Idare not, said the ass; I am bashful. And the more they stroveby fair means to bring him with them, the more the stub-born thing was untoward, and flew out at the heels; insomuchthat they might have been there to this hour, had not hismistress advised them to toss oats in a sieve or in a blanket,and call him; which was done, and made him wheel aboutand say, Oats, with a witness! oats shall go to pot. Adveniat;oats will do, there’s evidence in the case; but none of therubbing down, none of the firking. Thus melodiously sing-ing (for, as you know, that Arcadian bird’s note is very har-monious) he came to the young gentleman of the horse, aliasblack garb, who brought him to the stable.When he was there, they placed him next to the great horsehis friend, rubbed him down, currycombed him, laid cleanstraw under him up to the chin, and there he lay at rack andmanger, the first stuffed with sweet hay, the latter with oats;which when the horse’s valet-dear-chambre sifted, he clappeddown his lugs, to tell them by signs that he could eat it buttoo well without sifting, and that he did not deserve so greatan honour.When they had well fed, quoth the horse to the ass; Well,poor ass, how is it with thee now? How dost thou like thisfare? Thou wert so nice at first, a body had much ado to getthee hither. By the fig, answered the ass, which, one of ourancestors eating, Philemon died laughing, this is all sheerambrosia, good Sir Grandpaw; but what would you have anass say? Methinks all this is yet but half cheer. Don’t yourworships here now and then use to take a leap? What leapingdost thou mean? asked the horse; the devil leap thee! dostthou take me for an ass? In troth, Sir Grandpaw, quoth theass, I am somewhat of a blockhead, you know, and cannot,for the heart’s blood of me, learn so fast the court way ofspeaking of you gentlemen horses; I mean, don’t youstallionize it sometimes here among your mettled fillies? Tush,whispered the horse, speak lower; for, by Bucephalus, if thegrooms but hear thee they will maul and belam thee thriceand threefold, so that thou wilt have but little stomach to aleaping bout.

Eat less, and leap more, Isay; it is meat, drink, and cloth to us. Ah! friend Grandpaw,it would do thy heart good to see us at a fair, when we holdour provincial chapter! Oh! how we leap it, while our mis-tresses are selling their goslings and other poultry! With thisthey parted. Dixi; I have done.Panurge then held his peace. Pantagruel would have hadhim to have gone on to the end of the chapter; but Aedituussaid, A word to the wise is enough; I can pick out the mean-ing of that fable, and know who is that ass, and who thehorse; but you are a bashful youth, I perceive. Well, knowthat there’s nothing for you here; scatter no words.

How, askedPantagruel, has he Plato’s helmet on his crown, Gyges’s ringon his pounces, or a chameleon on his breast, to make himinvisible when he pleases?

With this he leftus piddling; then within a quarter of an hour came back,and told us the pope-hawk is now to be seen.

Then with a loud voice he said,A curse light on the hatcher of the ill bird; o’ my word, thisis a filthy whoop-hooper. Tush, speak softly, said Aedituus;by G—, he has a pair of ears, as formerly Michael deMatiscones remarked. What then? returned Panurge; so hatha whoopcat.

Out of it shall sallythunderbolts and lightnings, storms, bulls, and the devil andall, that will sink you down to Peg Trantum’s, an hundredfathom under ground. It were better to drink and be merry,quoth Friar John.Panurge was still feeding his eyes with the sight of the pope-hawk and his attendants, when somewhere under his cagehe perceived a madge-howlet. With this he cried out, By thedevil’s maker, master, there’s roguery in the case; they puttricks upon travellers here more than anywhere else, andwould make us believe that a t—d’s a sugarloaf.

It is nomadge-howlet, no she-thing on my honest word; but a male,and a noble bird.May we not hear the pope-hawk sing? asked Pantagruel. Idare not promise that, returned Aedituus; for he only singsand eats at his own hours. So don’t I, quoth Panurge; poorpilgarlic is fain to make everybody’s time his own; if theyhave time, I find time. Come, then, let us go drink, if youwill. Now this is something like a tansy, said Aedituus; youbegin to talk somewhat like; still speak in that fashion, andI’ll secure you from being thought a heretic. Come on, I amof your mind.As we went back to have t’other fuddling bout, we spiedan old green-headed bish-hawk, who sat moping with hismate and three jolly bittern attendants, all snoring under anarbour.

There was no making him sing. By G—, quoth Panurge, you old buzzard, if you won’t sing by fairmeans, you shall by foul. Having said this, he took up one ofSt. Stephen’s loaves, alias a stone, and was going to hit himwith it about the middle. But Aedituus cried to him, Hold,hold, honest friend! strike, wound, poison, kill, and murderall the kings and princes in the world, by treachery or howthou wilt, and as soon as thou wouldst unnestle the angelsfrom their cockloft. Pope-hawk will pardon thee all this. Butnever be so mad as to meddle with these sacred birds, asmuch as thou lovest the profit, welfare, and life not only ofthyself, and thy friends and relations alive or dead, but alsoof those that may be born hereafter to the thousandth gen-eration; for so long thou wouldst entail misery upon them.Do but look upon that basin. Catso! let us rather drink, then,quoth Panurge.

Come on, then, let’s go drink;how well that word sounds!The third day (after we had drank, as you must under-stand) Aedituus dismissed us. We made him a present of apretty little Perguois knife, which he took more kindly thanArtaxerxes did the cup of cold water that was given him by aclown. He most courteously thanked us, and sent all sorts ofprovisions aboard our ships, wished us a prosperous voyageand success in our undertakings, and made us promise andswear by Jupiter of stone to come back by his territories.Finally he said to us, Friends, pray note that there are manymore stones in the world than men; take care you don’t for-get it."},{"pageNumber":704,"pageContent":"704Gargantua & PantagruelChapter 5.IX.Chapter 5.IX.Chapter 5.IX.Chapter 5.IX.Chapter 5.IX.HHHHHooooow ww ww ww ww we arrive arrive arrive arrive arrived at the island of ed at the island of ed at the island of ed at the island of ed at the island of TTTTTools.ools.ools.ools.ools.Having well ballasted the holds of our human vessels, weweighed anchor, hoised up sail, stowed the boats, set theland, and stood for the offing with a fair loom gale, and formore haste unpareled the mizen-yard, and launched it andthe sail over the lee-quarter, and fitted gyves to keep it steady,and boomed it out; so in three days we made the island ofTools, that is altogether uninhabited.

But when they came down, there was need of taking carelest they happened to touch the head, feet, or other parts ofthe body. For they fell with the point downwards, and in theystuck, or slit the continuum of some member, or lopped it offlike a twig; either of which generally was enough to have killeda man, though he were a hundred years old, and worth asmany thousand spankers, spur-royals, and rose-nobles.Under some other trees, whose names I cannot justly tellyou, I saw some certain sorts of weeds that grew and sproutedlike pikes, lances, javelins, javelots, darts, dartlets, halberds,boar-spears, eel-spears, partizans, tridents, prongs, trout-staves, spears, half-pikes, and hunting-staves. As they sproutedup and chanced to touch the tree, straight they met withtheir heads, points, and blades, each suitable to its kind, madeready for them by the trees over them, as soon as every indi-vidual wood was grown up, fit for its steel; even like thechildren’s coats, that are made for them as soon as they canwear them and you wean them of their swaddling clothes."},{"pageNumber":705,"pageContent":"705RabelaisNor do you mutter, I pray you, at what Plato, Anaxagoras,and Democritus have said.

Butin this point they differed from other animals, that theirheads, that is, the part of their trunks next to the root, aredownwards; their hair, that is, their roots, in the earth; andtheir feet, that is, their branches, upside down; as if a manshould stand on his head with outstretched legs. And as you,battered sinners, on whom Venus has bestowed somethingto remember her, feel the approach of rains, winds, cold,and every change of weather, at your ischiatic legs and youromoplates, by means of the perpetual almanack which shehas fixed there; so these trees have notice given them, bycertain sensations which they have at their roots, stocks, gums,paps, or marrow, of the growth of the staves under them,and accordingly they prepare suitable points and blades forthem beforehand. Yet as all things, except God, are some-times subject to error, nature itself not free from it when itproduceth monstrous things, likewise I observed somethingamiss in these trees. For a half-pike that grow up high enoughto reach the branches of one of these instrumentiferous trees,happened no sooner to touch them but, instead of beingjoined to an iron head, it impaled a stubbed broom at thefundament.

This made him ask the new-comers whitherand to whom they were going to carry those dainty goods.They answered that they were for Gripe-men-all and theFurred Law-cats.Pray, asked he, what is the true name of all these things inyour country language? Corruption, they replied. If they liveon corruption, said the friar, they will perish with their gen-eration. May the devil be damned, I have it now: their fa-thers devoured the good gentlemen who, according to theirstate of life, used to go much a-hunting and hawking, to bethe better inured to toil in time of war; for hunting is animage of a martial life, and Xenophon was much in the rightof it when he affirmed that hunting had yielded a great num-ber of excellent warriors, as well as the Trojan horse. For mypart, I am no scholar; I have it but by hearsay, yet I believe it.Now the souls of those brave fellows, according to Gripe-men-all’s riddle, after their decease enter into wild boars, stags,roebucks, herns, and such other creatures which they loved,and in quest of which they went while they were men; andthese Furred Law-cats, having first destroyed and devouredtheir castles, lands, demesnes, possessions, rents, and rev-enues, are still seeking to have their blood and soul in an-other life.

You gothrough a large peristyle, alias a long entry set about withpillars, in which you see, in a kind of landscape, the ruins ofalmost the whole world, besides so many great robbers’ gib-bets, so many gallows and racks, that ’tis enough to frightyou out of your seven senses. Double-fee perceiving thatPantagruel was taken up with contemplating those things,Let us go further, sir, said he to him; all this is nothing yet.Nothing, quotha, cried Friar John; by the soul of my over-heated codpiece, friend Panurge and I here shake and quiver"},{"pageNumber":722,"pageContent":"722Gargantua & Pantagruelfor mere hunger. I had rather be drinking than staring atthese ruins. Pray come along, sir, said Double-fee. He thenled us into a little wine-press that lay backwards in a blindcorner, and was called Pithies in the language of the country.You need not ask whether Master John and Panurge mademuch of their sweet selves there; it is enough that I tell youthere was no want of Bolognia sausages, turkey poots, ca-pons, bustards, malmsey, and all other sorts of good belly-timber, very well dressed.A pimping son of ten fathers, who, for want of a better,did the office of a butler, seeing that Friar John had cast asheep’s eye at a choice bottle that stood near a cupboard byitself, at some distance from the rest of the bottellic maga-zine, like a jack-in-an-office said to Pantagruel, Sir, I per-ceive that one of your men here is making love to this bottle.He ogles it, and would fain caress it; but I beg that noneoffer to meddle with it; for it is reserved for their worships.How, cried Panurge, there are some grandees here then, Isee. It is vintage time with you, I perceive.Then Double-fee led us up to a private staircase, andshowed us into a room, whence, without being seen, out at aloophole we could see their worships in the great wine-press,where none could be admitted without their leave. Theirworships, as he called them, were about a score of fusty crack-ropes and gallow-clappers, or rather more, all posted beforea bar, and staring at each other like so many dead pigs. Theirpaws were as long as a crane’s foot, and their claws four-and-twenty inches long at least; for you must know they are en-joined never to pare off the least chip of them, so that theygrow as crooked as a Welsh hook or a hedging-bill.We saw a swingeing bunch of grapes that are gathered andsqueezed in that country, brought in by them. As soon as itwas laid down, they clapped it into the press, and there wasnot a bit of it out of which each of them did not squeeze someoil of gold; insomuch that the poor grape was tried with awitness, and brought off so drained and picked, and so dry,that there was not the least moisture, juice, or substance left init; for they had pressed out its very quintessence.Double-fee told us they had not often such huge bunches;but, let the worst come to the worst, they were sure never tobe without others in their press. But hark you me, master ofmine, asked Panurge, have they not some of different growth?"},{"pageNumber":723,"pageContent":"723RabelaisAy, marry have they, quoth Double-fee. Do you see here thislittle bunch, to which they are going to give t’other wrench?It is of tithe-growth, you must know; they crushed, wrung,squeezed and strained out the very heart’s blood of it but theother day; but it did not bleed freely; the oil came hard, andsmelt of the priest’s chest; so that they found there was notmuch good to be got out of it. Why then, said Pantagruel,do they put it again into the press? Only, answered Double-fee, for fear there should still lurk some juice among the husksand hullings in the mother of the grape. The devil be damned!cried Friar John; do you call these same folks illiterate lobcocksand duncical doddipolls? May I be broiled like a red herringif I do not think they are wise enough to skin a flint anddraw oil out of a brick wall. So they are, said Double-fee; forthey sometimes put castles, parks, and forests into the press,and out of them all extract aurum potabile. You meanportabile, I suppose, cried Epistemon, such as may be borne.I mean as I said, replied Double-fee, potabile, such as maybe drunk; for it makes them drink many a good bottle morethan otherwise they should.But I cannot better satisfy you as to the growth of the vine-tree sirup that is here squeezed out of grapes, than in desir-ing you to look yonder in that back-yard, where you will seeabove a thousand different growths that lie waiting to besqueezed every moment. Here are some of the public andsome of the private growth; some of the builders’ fortifica-tions, loans, gifts, and gratuities, escheats, forfeitures, fines,and recoveries, penal statutes, crown lands, and demesne,privy purse, post-offices, offerings, lordships of manors, anda world of other growths, for which we want names. Pray,quoth Epistemon, tell me of what growth is that great one,with all those little grapelings about it. Oh, oh! returnedDouble-fee, that plump one is of the treasury, the very bestgrowth in the whole country. Whenever anyone of thatgrowth is squeezed, there is not one of their worships butgets juice enough of it to soak his nose six months together.When their worships were up, Pantagruel desired Double-fee to take us into that great wine-press, which he readilydid. As soon as we were in, Epistemon, who understood allsorts of tongues, began to show us many devices on the press,which was large and fine, and made of the wood of the cross—at least Double-fee told us so. On each part of it were names"},{"pageNumber":724,"pageContent":"724Gargantua & Pantagruelof everything in the language of the country.

Why!here are a parcel of words full as analogous as chalk and cheese,or a cat and a cart-wheel! But why, prithee, dear Double-fee,do they call these worshipful dons of yours ignorant fellows?Only, said Double-fee, because they neither are, nor oughtto be, clerks, and all must be ignorant as to what they trans-act here; nor is there to be any other reason given, but, Thecourt hath said it; The court will have it so; The court hasdecreed it. Cop’s body, quoth Pantagruel, they might full aswell have called ‘em necessity; for necessity has no law.From thence, as he was leading us to see a thousand littlepuny presses, we spied another paltry bar, about which satfour are five ignorant waspish churls, of so testy, fuming atemper, (like an ass with squibs and crackers tied to its tail,)and so ready to take pepper in the nose for yea and nay, thata dog would not have lived with ‘em. They were hard at itwith the lees and dregs of the grapes, which they grippedover and over again, might and main, with their clenchedfists. They were called contractors in the language of the coun-try. These are the ugliest, misshapen, grim-looking scrubs,said Friar John, that ever were beheld, with or without spec-tacles. Then we passed by an infinite number of little pimp-ing wine-presses all full of vintage-mongers, who were pick-ing, examining, and raking the grapes with some instrumentscalled bills-of-charge.Finally we came into a hall downstairs, where we saw anovergrown cursed mangy cur with a pair of heads, a wolf ’sbelly, and claws like the devil of hell. The son of a bitch wasfed with costs, for he lived on a multiplicity of fine amondsand amerciaments by order of their worships, to each ofwhom the monster was worth more than the best farm inthe land. In their tongue of ignorance they called him Two-fold.

She was certainly the mostcursed and dangerous creature of the place, except her gran-dam, which we saw, and had been kept locked up in a dun-geon time out of mind, and her name was Refusing-of-fees.Friar John, who had always twenty yards of gut ready emptyto swallow a gallimaufry of lawyers, began to be somewhatout of humour, and desired Pantagruel to remember he hadnot dined, and bring Double-fee along with him. So awaywe went, and as we marched out at the back-gate whomshould we meet but an old piece of mortality in chains. Hewas half ignorant and half learned, like an hermaphrodite ofSatan. The fellow was all caparisoned with spectacles as atortoise is with shells, and lived on nothing but a sort offood which, in their gibberish, was called appeals. Pantagruelasked Double-fee of what breed was that prothonotary, andwhat name they gave him. Double-fee told us that time outof mind he had been kept there in chains, to the great griefof their worships, who starved him, and his name was Re-view. By the pope’s sanctified two-pounders, cried Friar John,I do not much wonder at the meagre cheer which this oldchuff finds among their worships. Do but look a little on theweather-beaten scratch-toby, friend Panurge; by the sacredtip of my cowl, I’ll lay five pounds to a hazel-nut the foulthief has the very looks of Gripe-me-now.

When we were safe in the port we took some refresh-ment, and took in fresh water and wood. The people of theplace, who had the countenance of jolly fellows and booncompanions, were all of them forward folks, bloated andpuffed up with fat. And we saw some who slashed and pinkedtheir skins to open a passage to the fat, that it might swellout at the slits and gashes which they made; neither morenor less than the shit-breech fellows in our country bepinkand cut open their breeches that the taffety on the insidemay stand out and be puffed up. They said that what theydid was not out of pride or ostentation, but because other-wise their skins would not hold them without much pain.Having thus slashed their skin, they used to grow much big-ger, like the young trees on whose barks the gardeners makeincisions that they may grow the better.Near the haven there was a tavern, which forwards seemedvery fine and stately. We repaired thither, and found it filledwith people of the forward nation, of all ages, sexes, andconditions; so that we thought some notable feast or otherwas getting ready, but we were told that all that throng wereinvited to the bursting of mine host, which caused all hisfriends and relations to hasten thither.We did not understand that jargon, and therefore thoughtin that country by that bursting they meant some merrymeeting or other, as we do in ours by betrothing, wedding,groaning, christening, churching (of women), shearing (ofsheep), reaping (of corn, or harvest-home), and many otherjunketting bouts that end in -ing. But we soon heard thatthere was no such matter in hand.The master of the house, you must know, had been a goodfellow in his time, loved heartily to wind up his bottom, tobang the pitcher, and lick his dish. He used to be a very fairswallower of gravy soup, a notable accountant in matter of"},{"pageNumber":727,"pageContent":"727Rabelaishours, and his whole life was one continual dinner, like minehost at Rouillac (in Perigord). But now, having farted outmuch fat for ten years together, according to the custom ofthe country, he was drawing towards his bursting hour; forneither the inner thin kell wherewith the entrails are cov-ered, nor his skin that had been jagged and mangled so manyyears, were able to hold and enclose his guts any longer, orhinder them from forcing their way out. Pray, quoth Panurge,is there no remedy, no help for the poor man, good people?Why don’t you swaddle him round with good tight girths,or secure his natural tub with a strong sorb-apple-tree hoop?Nay, why don’t you iron-bind him, if needs be? This wouldkeep the man from flying out and bursting. The word wasnot yet out of his mouth when we heard something give aloud report, as if a huge sturdy oak had been split in two.Then some of the neighbours told us that the bursting wasover, and that the clap or crack which we heard was the lastfart, and so there was an end of mine host.This made me call to mind a saying of the venerable abbotof Castilliers, the very same who never cared to hump hischambermaids but when he was in pontificalibus. That pi-ous person, being much dunned, teased, and importuned byhis relations to resign his abbey in his old age, said and pro-fessed that he would not strip till he was ready to go to bed,and that the last fart which his reverend paternity was toutter should be the fart of an abbot.Chapter 5.XVIII.Chapter 5.XVIII.Chapter 5.XVIII.Chapter 5.XVIII.Chapter 5.XVIII.HHHHHooooow our ships ww our ships ww our ships ww our ships ww our ships wererererere stranded, and we stranded, and we stranded, and we stranded, and we stranded, and we we we we we wererererere re re re re relievelievelievelievelieved bed bed bed bed byyyyysome people that wsome people that wsome people that wsome people that wsome people that wererererere subject to Qe subject to Qe subject to Qe subject to Qe subject to Queen ueen ueen ueen ueen WhimsWhimsWhimsWhimsWhims(qui tenoient de la Q(qui tenoient de la Q(qui tenoient de la Q(qui tenoient de la Q(qui tenoient de la Quinte).uinte).uinte).uinte).uinte).We weighed and set sail with a merry westerly gale.

For he assured us that,as these gusts and whirlwinds would not do us much good,so they could not do us much harm, considering their easi-ness and pleasant strife, as also the clearness of the sky andcalmness of the current. So that we were to observe thephilosopher’s rule, bear and forbear; that is, trim, or go ac-cording to the time.However, these whirlwinds and gusts lasted so long thatwe persuaded the master to let us go and lie at trie with ourmain course; that is, to haul the tack aboard, the sheet closeaft, the bowline set up, and the helm tied close aboard; so,after a stormy gale of wind, we broke through the whirl-wind. But it was like falling into Scylla to avoid Charybdis(out of the frying-pan into the fire). For we had not sailed aleague ere our ships were stranded upon some sands such asare the flats of St. Maixent.All our company seemed mightily disturbed except FriarJohn, who was not a jot daunted, and with sweet sugar-plumwords comforted now one and then another, giving themhopes of speedy assistance from above, and telling them thathe had seen Castor at the main-yardarm.

To these four questions he answered, FromQueen Whims; for Touraine; alchemy; to the very bottom.Whom have you got o’ board? said I. Said he, Astrologers,fortune-tellers, alchemists, rhymers, poets, painters, projec-tors, mathematicians, watchmakers, sing-songs, musicianers,and the devil and all of others that are subject to QueenWhims (Motteux gives the following footnote:—’La Quinte,This means a fantastic Humour, Maggots, or a foolish Gid-diness of Brains; and also, a fifth, or the Proportion of Fivein music, &c.’).

For the dub-a-dub rat-tling of the drums, with the soft noise of the gravel whichmurmuring disputed us our way, and the merry cheers andhuzzas of the sailors, made an harmony almost as good asthat of the heavenly bodies when they roll and are whirledround their spheres, which rattling of the celestial wheelsPlato said he heard some nights in his sleep.We scorned to be behindhand with ‘em in civility, andgratefully gave ‘em store of our sausages and chitterlings, withwhich we filled their drums; and we were just a-hoisting two-and-sixty hogsheads of wine out of the hold, when two hugewhirlpools with great fury made towards their ship, spout-ing more water than is in the river Vienne (Vigenne) fromChinon to Saumur; to make short, all their drums, all theirsails, their concerns, and themselves were soused, and theirvery hose were watered by the collar.Panurge was so overjoyed, seeing this, and laughed so heart-ily, that he was forced to hold his sides, and it set him into afit of the colic for two hours and more.

He thenshowed us a set of organs, and said that when it was touchedby her those miraculous cures were performed. The organwas indeed the strangest that ever eyes beheld; for the pipeswere of cassia fistula in the cod; the top and cornice ofguiacum; the bellows of rhubarb; the pedas of turbith, andthe clavier or keys of scammony.While we were examining this wonderful new make of anorgan, the leprous were brought in by her abstractors,spodizators, masticators, pregustics, tabachins, chachanins,neemanins, rabrebans, nercins, rozuins, nebidins, tearins,segamions, perarons, chasinins, sarins, soteins, aboth, enilins,archasdarpenins, mebins, chabourins, and other officers, forwhom I want names; so she played ‘em I don’t know whatsort of a tune or song, and they were all immediately cured.Then those who were poisoned were had in, and she hadno sooner given them a song but they began to find a use fortheir legs, and up they got.

In the school ofPythagoras, taciturnity was the symbol of abstracted andsuperlative knowledge, and the silence of the Egyptians wasagnited as an expressive manner of divine adoration; thiscaused the pontiffs of Hierapolis to sacrifice to the great de-ity in silence, impercussively, without any vociferous or ob-streperous sound.

Those of the otherband were clad in cloth of silver.They posted themselves on the tapestry in the followingmanner: the kings on the last line on the fourth square; sothat the golden king was on a white square, and the silveredking on a yellow square, and each queen by her king; thegolden queen on a yellow square, and the silvered queen ona white one: and on each side stood the archers to guidetheir kings and queens; by the archers the knights, and thewardens by them. In the next row before ‘em stood the eightnymphs; and between the two bands of nymphs four rowsof squares stood empty.Each band had its musicians, eight on each side, dressed inits livery; the one with orange-coloured damask, the otherwith white; and all played on different instruments mostmelodiously and harmoniously, still varying in time andmeasure as the figure of the dance required. This seemed tome an admirable thing, considering the numerous diversityof steps, back-steps, bounds, rebounds, jerks, paces, leaps,skips, turns, coupes, hops, leadings, risings, meetings, flights,ambuscadoes, moves, and removes.I was also at a loss when I strove to comprehend how thedancers could so suddenly know what every different notemeant; for they no sooner heard this or that sound but theyplaced themselves in the place which was denoted by themusic, though their motions were all different.

The knightsmove and take in a lineal manner, stepping over one square,though a friend or foe stand upon it, posting themselves onthe second square to the right or left, from one colour toanother, which is very unwelcome to the adverse party, andought to be carefully observed, for they take at unawares.The wardens move and take to the right or left, before orbehind them, like the kings, and can advance as far as theyfind places empty; which liberty the kings take not.The law which both sides observe is, at the end of thefight, to besiege and enclose the king of either party, so thathe may not be able to move; and being reduced to that ex-tremity, the battle is over, and he loses the day.Now, to avoid this, there is none of either sex of each partybut is willing to sacrifice his or her life, and they begin totake one another on all sides in time, as soon as the musicstrikes up.

The golden queen distinguishes herself from the restby her mighty achievements still more than by her garb anddignity; for at once she takes an archer, and, going sideways,seizes a silvered warden. Which thing the silvered queen per-ceiving, she came forwards, and, rushing on with equal brav-ery, takes the last golden warden and some nymphs. Thetwo queens fought a long while hand to hand; now strivingto take each other by surprise, then to save themselves, andsometimes to guard their kings. Finally, the golden queentook the silvered queen; but presently after she herself wastaken by the silvered archer.Then the silvered king had only three nymphs, an archer,and a warden left, and the golden only three nymphs andthe right knight, which made them fight more slowly andwarily than before. The two kings seemed to mourn for theloss of their loving queens, and only studied and endeav-oured to get new ones out of all their nymphs to be raised tothat dignity, and thus be married to them. This made themexcite those brave nymphs to strive to reach the farthest rank,where stood the king of the contrary party, promising themcertainly to have them crowned if they could do this.

But in the meantime the silvered knight takesthe golden warden who guarded the camp; and thus therewas a new silvered queen, who, like the other, strove to excelin heroic deeds at the beginning of her reign.

And thus the first battle ended to theunspeakable joy of all the spectators.After this the two brigades took their former stations, andbegan to tilt a second time, much as they had done before,only the music played somewhat faster than at the first battle,and the motions were altogether different. I saw the goldenqueen sally out one of the first, with an archer and a knight,as it were angry at the former defeat, and she had like to havefallen upon the silvered king in his tent among his officers;but having been baulked in her attempt, she skirmishedbriskly, and overthrew so many silvered nymphs and officersthat it was a most amazing sight. You would have sworn shehad been another Penthesilea; for she behaved herself withas much bravery as that Amazonian queen did at Troy.But this havoc did not last long; for the silvered party, ex-asperated by their loss, resolved to perish or stop her progress;and having posted an archer in ambuscado on a distant angle,together with a knight-errant, her highness fell into theirhands and was carried out of the field. The rest were soonrouted after the taking of their queen, who, without doubt,from that time resolved to be more wary and keep near herking, without venturing so far amidst her enemies unlesswith more force to defend her. Thus the silvered brigade oncemore got the victory.This did not dishearten or deject the golden party; far fromit. They soon appeared again in the field to face their en-emies; and being posted as before, both the armies seemedmore resolute and cheerful than ever. Now the martial con-cert began, and the music was above a hemiole the quicker,according to the warlike Phrygian mode, such as was in-"},{"pageNumber":749,"pageContent":"749Rabelaisvented by Marsyas.Then our combatants began to wheel about, and chargewith such a swiftness that in an instant they made four moves,besides the usual salutations. So that they were continuallyin action, flying, hovering, jumping, vaulting, curvetting,with petauristical turns and motions, and often intermingled.Seeing them then turn about on one foot after they hadmade their honours, we compared them to your tops or gigs,such as boys use to whip about, making them turn round soswiftly that they sleep, as they call it, and motion cannot beperceived, but resembles rest, its contrary; so that if you makea point or mark on some part of one of those gigs, ‘twill beperceived not as a point, but a continual line, in a most di-vine manner, as Cusanus has wisely observed.While they were thus warmly engaged, we heard continu-ally the claps and episemapsies which those of the two bandsreiterated at the taking of their enemies; and this, joined tothe variety of their motions and music, would have forcedsmiles out of the most severe Cato, the never-laughingCrassus, the Athenian man-hater, Timon; nay, even whiningHeraclitus, though he abhorred laughing, the action that ismost peculiar to man. For who could have forborne? seeingthose young warriors, with their nymphs and queens, sobriskly and gracefully advance, retire, jump, leap, skip, spring,fly, vault, caper, move to the right, to the left, every way stillin time, so swiftly, and yet so dexterously, that they nevertouched one another but methodically.As the number of the combatants lessened, the pleasure ofthe spectators increased; for the stratagems and motions ofthe remaining forces were more singular. I shall only add thatthis pleasing entertainment charmed us to such a degree thatour minds were ravished with admiration and delight, and themartial harmony moved our souls so powerfully that we easilybelieved what is said of Ismenias’s having excited Alexander torise from table and run to his arms, with such a warlike melody.At last the golden king remained master of the field; and whilewe were minding those dances, Queen Whims vanished, sothat we saw her no more from that day to this.Then Geber’s michelots conducted us, and we were setdown among her abstractors, as her queenship had com-manded.

The ways there are animals; so true isAristotle’s saying, that all self-moving things are animals. Nowthe ways walk there. Ergo, they are then animals. Some ofthem are strange unknown ways, like those of the planets;others are highways, crossways, and byways. I perceived thatthe travellers and inhabitants of that country asked, Whitherdoes this way go? Whither does that way go? Some answered,Between Midy and Fevrolles, to the parish church, to thecity, to the river, and so forth. Being thus in their right way,they used to reach their journey’s end without any furthertrouble, just like those who go by water from Lyons toAvignon or Arles.Now, as you know that nothing is perfect here below, weheard there was a sort of people whom they called highway-men, waybeaters, and makers of inroads in roads; and thatthe poor ways were sadly afraid of them, and shunned themas you do robbers. For these used to waylay them, as peoplelay trains for wolves, and set gins for woodcocks. I saw onewho was taken up with a lord chief justice’s warrant for hav-ing unjustly, and in spite of Pallas, taken the schoolway, whichis the longest. Another boasted that he had fairly taken hisshortest, and that doing so he first compassed his design.Thus, Carpalin, meeting once Epistemon looking upon awall with his fiddle-diddle, or live urinal, in his hand, tomake a little maid’s water, cried that he did not wonder nowhow the other came to be still the first at Pantagruel’s levee,since he held his shortest and least used.I found Bourges highway among these. It went with thedeliberation of an abbot, but was made to scamper at theapproach of some waggoners, who threatened to have ittrampled under their horses’ feet, and make their waggonsrun over it, as Tullia’s chariot did over her father’s body."},{"pageNumber":751,"pageContent":"751RabelaisI also espied there the old way between Peronne and St.Quentin, which seemed to me a very good, honest, plainway, as smooth as a carpet, and as good as ever was trodupon by shoe of leather.Among the rocks I knew again the good old way to LaFerrare, mounted on a huge bear. This at a distance wouldhave put me in mind of St. Jerome’s picture, had but thebear been a lion; for the poor way was all mortified, andwore a long hoary beard uncombed and entangled, whichlooked like the picture of winter, or at least like a white-frosted bush.On that way were store of beads or rosaries, coarsely madeof wild pine-tree; and it seemed kneeling, not standing, norlying flat; but its sides and middle were beaten with hugestones, insomuch that it proved to us at once an object offear and pity.While we were examining it, a runner, bachelor of the place,took us aside, and showing us a white smooth way, some-what filled with straw, said, Henceforth, gentlemen, do notreject the opinion of Thales the Milesian, who said that wa-ter is the beginning of all things, nor that of Homer, whotells us that all things derive their original from the ocean;for this same way which you see here had its beginning fromwater, and is to return whence she came before two monthscome to an end; now carts are driven here where boats usedto rowed.Truly, said Pantagruel, you tell us no news; we see five hun-dred such changes, and more, every year, in our world. Thenreflecting on the different manner of going of those movingways, he told us he believed that Philolaus and Aristarchushad philosophized in this island, and that Seleucus (Motteuxreads—’that some, indeed, were of opinion.’), indeed, wasof opinion the earth turns round about its poles, and not theheavens, whatever we may think to the contrary; as, whenwe are on the river Loire, we think the trees and the shoremoves, though this is only an effect of our boat’s motion.As we went back to our ships, we saw three waylayers, who,having been taken in ambuscado, were going to be brokenon the wheel; and a huge fornicator was burned with a lin-gering fire for beating a way and breaking one of its sides; wewere told it was the way of the banks of the Nile in Egypt."},{"pageNumber":752,"pageContent":"752Gargantua & PantagruelChapter 5.XXVII.Chapter 5.XXVII.Chapter 5.XXVII.Chapter 5.XXVII.Chapter 5.XXVII.HHHHHooooow ww ww ww ww we came to the island of Se came to the island of Se came to the island of Se came to the island of Se came to the island of Sandals; and of the orandals; and of the orandals; and of the orandals; and of the orandals; and of the orderderderderderof Sof Sof Sof Sof Semiquavemiquavemiquavemiquavemiquaver Fer Fer Fer Fer Friars.riars.riars.riars.riars.Thence we went to the island of Sandals, whose inhabitantslive on nothing but ling-broth. However, we were very kindlyreceived and entertained by Benius the Third, king of theisland, who, after he had made us drink, took us with him toshow us a spick-and-span new monastery which he had con-trived for the Semiquaver Friars; so he called the religiousmen whom he had there. For he said that on t’other side thewater lived friars who styled themselves her sweet ladyship’smost humble servants. Item, the goodly Friar-minors, whoare semibreves of bulls; the smoked-herring tribe of MinimFriars; then the Crotchet Friars. So that these diminutivescould be no more than Semiquavers. By the statutes, bulls,and patents of Queen Whims, they were all dressed like somany house-burners, except that, as in Anjou your bricklay-ers use to quilt their knees when they tile houses, so theseholy friars had usually quilted bellies, and thick quiltedpaunches were among them in much repute. Their codpieceswere cut slipper-fashion, and every monk among them woretwo—one sewed before and another behind—reporting thatsome certain dreadful mysteries were duly represented bythis duplicity of codpieces.They wore shoes as round as basins, in imitation of thosewho inhabit the sandy sea. Their chins were close-shaved,and their feet iron-shod; and to show they did not valuefortune, Benius made them shave and poll the hind part oftheir polls as bare as a bird’s arse, from the crown to theshoulder-blades; but they had leave to let their hair growbefore, from the two triangular bones in the upper part ofthe skull.Thus did they not value fortune a button, and cared nomore for the goods of this world than you or I do for hang-ing. And to show how much they defied that blind jilt, all ofthem wore, not in their hands like her, but at their waist,instead of beads, sharp razors, which they used to new-grindtwice a day and set thrice a night.Each of them had a round ball on their feet, because For-tune is said to have one under hers."},{"pageNumber":753,"pageContent":"753RabelaisThe flap of their cowls hanged forward, and not backwards,like those of others. Thus none could see their noses, andthey laughed without fear both at fortune and the fortunate;neither more nor less than our ladies laugh at barefaced trullswhen they have those mufflers on which they call masks,and which were formerly much more properly called char-ity, because they cover a multitude of sins.The hind part of their faces were always uncovered, as areour faces, which made them either go with their belly or thearse foremost, which they pleased. When their hind face wentforwards, you would have sworn this had been their naturalgait, as well on account of their round shoes as of the doublecodpiece, and their face behind, which was as bare as theback of my hand, and coarsely daubed over with two eyesand a mouth, such as you see on some Indian nuts. Now, ifthey offered to waddle along with their bellies forwards, youwould have thought they were then playing at blindman’sbuff. May I never be hanged if ’twas not a comical sight.Their way of living was thus: about owl-light they charita-bly began to boot and spur one another. This being done,the least thing they did was to sleep and snore; and thussleeping, they had barnacles on the handles of their faces, orspectacles at most.You may swear we did not a little wonder at this odd fancy;but they satisfied us presently, telling us that the day of judg-ment is to take mankind napping; therefore, to show theydid not refuse to make their personal appearance as fortune’sdarlings use to do, they were always thus booted and spurred,ready to mount whenever the trumpet should sound.At noon, as soon as the clock struck, they used to awake.You must know that their clock-bell, church-bells, and re-fectory-bells were all made according to the pontial device,that is, quilted with the finest down, and their clappers offox-tails.Having then made shift to get up at noon, they pulled offtheir boots, and those that wanted to speak with a maid,alias piss, pissed; those that wanted to scumber, scumbered;and those that wanted to sneeze, sneezed. But all, whetherthey would or no (poor gentlemen!), were obliged largelyand plentifully to yawn; and this was their first breakfast (Origorous statute!). Methought ’twas very comical to observetheir transactions; for, having laid their boots and spurs on a"},{"pageNumber":754,"pageContent":"754Gargantua & Pantagruelrack, they went into the cloisters. There they curiously washedtheir hands and mouths; then sat them down on a long bench,and picked their teeth till the provost gave the signal, whis-tling through his fingers; then every he stretched out his jawsas much as he could, and they gaped and yawned for abouthalf-an-hour, sometimes more, sometimes less, according asthe prior judged the breakfast to be suitable to the day.After that they went in procession, two banners being car-ried before them, in one of which was the picture of Virtue,and that of Fortune in the other. The last went before, car-ried by a semi-quavering friar, at whose heels was another,with the shadow or image of Virtue in one hand and anholy-water sprinkle in the other—I mean of that holy mer-curial water which Ovid describes in his Fasti. And as thepreceding Semiquaver rang a handbell, this shaked thesprinkle with his fist. With that says Pantagruel, This ordercontradicts the rule which Tully and the academics prescribed,that Virtue ought to go before, and Fortune follow. But theytold us they did as they ought, seeing their design was tobreech, lash, and bethwack Fortune.During the processions they trilled and quavered most me-lodiously betwixt their teeth I do not know what antiphones,or chantings, by turns. For my part, ’twas all Hebrew-Greekto me, the devil a word I could pick out on’t; at last, prickingup my ears, and intensely listening, I perceived they onlysang with the tip of theirs. Oh, what a rare harmony it was!How well ’twas tuned to the sound of their bells! You’ll neverfind these to jar, that you won’t. Pantagruel made a notableobservation upon the processions; for says he, Have you seenand observed the policy of these Semiquavers? To make anend of their procession they went out at one of their churchdoors and came in at the other; they took a deal of care notto come in at the place whereat they went out. On my honour,these are a subtle sort of people, quoth Panurge; they have asmuch wit as three folks, two fools and a madman; they are aswise as the calf that ran nine miles to suck a bull, and whenhe came there ’twas a steer. This subtlety and wisdom of theirs,cried Friar John, is borrowed from the occult philosophy.May I be gutted like an oyster if I can tell what to make on’t.Then the more ’tis to be feared, said Pantagruel; for subtletysuspected, subtlety foreseen, subtlety found out, loses theessence and very name of subtlety, and only gains that of"},{"pageNumber":755,"pageContent":"755Rabelaisblockishness. They are not such fools as you take them to be;they have more tricks than are good, I doubt.After the procession they went sluggingly into the fratery-room, by the way of walk and healthful exercise, and therekneeled under the tables, leaning their breasts on lanterns.While they were in that posture, in came a huge Sandal,with a pitchfork in his hand, who used to baste, rib-roast,swaddle, and swinge them well-favouredly, as they said, andin truth treated them after a fashion. They began their mealas you end yours, with cheese, and ended it with mustardand lettuce, as Martial tells us the ancients did. Afterwards aplatterful of mustard was brought before every one of them,and thus they made good the proverb, After meat comesmustard. Their diet was this:O’ Sundays they stuffed their puddings with puddings, chit-terlings, links, Bologna sausages, forced-meats, liverings, hogs’haslets, young quails, and teals. You must also always addcheese for the first course, and mustard for the last.O’ Mondays they were crammed with peas and pork, cumcommento, and interlineary glosses.O’ Tuesdays they used to twist store of holy-bread, cakes,buns, puffs, lenten loaves, jumbles, and biscuits.O’ Wednesdays my gentlemen had fine sheep’s heads, calves’heads, and brocks’ heads, of which there’s no want in thatcountry.O’ Thursdays they guzzled down seven sorts of porridge,not forgetting mustard.O’ Fridays they munched nothing but services or sorb-apples; neither were these full ripe, as I guessed by their com-plexion.O’ Saturdays they gnawed bones; not that they were pooror needy, for every mother’s son of them had a very good fatbelly-benefice.As for their drink, ’twas an antifortunal; thus they called Idon’t know what sort of a liquor of the place.When they wanted to eat or drink, they turned down theback-points or flaps of their cowls forwards below their chins,and that served ‘em instead of gorgets or slabbering-bibs.When they had well dined, they prayed rarely all in qua-"},{"pageNumber":756,"pageContent":"756Gargantua & Pantagruelvers and shakes; and the rest of the day, expecting the day ofjudgment, they were taken up with acts of charity, and par-ticularly—O’ Sundays, rubbers at cuffs.O’ Mondays, lending each other flirts and fillips on thenose.O’ Tuesdays, clapperclawing one another.O’ Wednesdays, sniting and fly-flapping.O’ Thursdays, worming and pumping.O’ Fridays, tickling.O’ Saturdays, jerking and firking one another.Such was their diet when they resided in the convent, and ifthe prior of the monk-house sent any of them abroad, thenthey were strictly enjoined neither to touch nor eat any man-ner of fish as long as they were on sea or rivers, and to abstainfrom all manner of flesh whenever they were at land, that ev-eryone might be convinced that, while they enjoyed the ob-ject, they denied themselves the power, and even the desire,and were no more moved with it than the Marpesian rock.All this was done with proper antiphones, still sung andchanted by ear, as we have already observed.When the sun went to bed, they fairly booted and spurredeach other as before, and having clapped on their barnaclese’en jogged to bed too. At midnight the Sandal came to them,and up they got, and having well whetted and set their ra-zors, and been a-processioning, they clapped the tables overthemselves, and like wire-drawers under their work fell to itas aforesaid.Friar John des Entoumeures, having shrewdly observedthese jolly Semiquaver Friars, and had a full account of theirstatutes, lost all patience, and cried out aloud: Bounce tail,and God ha’ mercy guts; if every fool should wear a bauble,fuel would be dear. A plague rot it, we must know how manyfarts go to an ounce. Would Priapus were here, as he used tobe at the nocturnal festivals in Crete, that I might see himplay backwards, and wriggle and shake to the purpose. Ay,ay, this is the world, and t’other is the country; may I neverpiss if this be not an antichthonian land, and our very an-tipodes.

Its trees and herbage never lose their leaves orflowers, and are all damask and flowered velvet. As for thebeasts and birds, they are all of tapestry work. There we sawmany beasts, birds on trees, of the same colour, bigness, andshape of those in our country; with this difference, however,that these did eat nothing, and never sung or bit like ours;and we also saw there many sorts of creatures which we neverhad seen before.Among the rest, several elephants in various postures; twelveof which were the six males and six females that were broughtto Rome by their governor in the time of Germanicus,Tiberius’s nephew. Some of them were learned elephants,some musicians, others philosophers, dancers, and showersof tricks; and all sat down at table in good order, silentlyeating and drinking like so many fathers in a fratery-room.With their snouts or proboscises, some two cubits long,they draw up water for their own drinking, and take hold ofpalm leaves, plums, and all manner of edibles, using themoffensively or defensively as we do our fists; with them toss-ing men high into the air in fight, and making them burst"},{"pageNumber":768,"pageContent":"768Gargantua & Pantagruelwith laughing when they come to the ground.They have joints (in their legs), whatever some men, whodoubtless never saw any but painted, may have written tothe contrary.

These are some three or fourcubits long, and are fixed in the upper jawbone, and conse-quently not in the lowermost. If you hearken to those whowill tell you to the contrary, you will find yourself damnablymistaken, for that’s a lie with a latchet; though ‘twere Aelian,that long-bow man, that told you so, never believe him, forhe lies as fast as a dog can trot. ’Twas in this very island thatPliny, his brother tell-truth, had seen some elephants danceon the rope with bells, and whip over the tables, presto, be-gone, while people were at feasts, without so much as touch-ing the toping topers or the topers toping.I saw a rhinoceros there, just such a one as Harry Clerberghad formerly showed me. Methought it was not much un-like a certain boar which I had formerly seen at Limoges,except the sharp horn on its snout, that was about a cubitlong; by the means of which that animal dares encounterwith an elephant, that is sometimes killed with its point thrustinto its belly, which is its most tender and defenceless part.I saw there two and thirty unicorns. They are a curst sortof creatures, much resembling a fine horse, unless it be thattheir heads are like a stag’s, their feet like an elephant’s, theirtails like a wild boar’s, and out of each of their foreheadssprouts out a sharp black horn, some six or seven feet long;commonly it dangles down like a turkey-cock’s comb. Whena unicorn has a mind to fight, or put it to any other use,what does it do but make it stand, and then ’tis as straight asan arrow.I saw one of them, which was attended with a throng ofother wild beasts, purify a fountain with its horn. With thatPanurge told me that his prancer, alias his nimble-wimble,was like the unicorn, not altogether in length indeed, but invirtue and propriety; for as the unicorn purified pools andfountains from filth and venom, so that other animals cameand drank securely there afterwards, in the like manner oth-ers might water their nags, and dabble after him without"},{"pageNumber":769,"pageContent":"769Rabelaisfear of shankers, carnosities, gonorrhoeas, buboes, crinkams,and such other plagues caught by those who venture to quenchtheir amorous thirst in a common puddle; for with his ner-vous horn he removed all the infection that might be lurkingin some blind cranny of the mephitic sweet-scented hole.Well, quoth Friar John, when you are sped, that is, whenyou are married, we will make a trial of this on thy spouse,merely for charity sake, since you are pleased to give us sobeneficial an instruction.Ay, ay, returned Panurge, and then immediately I’ll giveyou a pretty gentle aggregative pill of God, made up of twoand twenty kind stabs with a dagger, after the Caesarian way.Catso, cried Friar John, I had rather take off a bumper ofgood cool wine.I saw there the golden fleece formerly conquered by Jason,and can assure you, on the word of an honest man, thatthose who have said it was not a fleece but a golden pippin,because (Greek) signifies both an apple and a sheep, wereutterly mistaken.I saw also a chameleon, such as Aristotle describes it, andlike that which had been formerly shown me by Charles Maris,a famous physician of the noble city of Lyons on the Rhone;and the said chameleon lived on air just as the other did.I saw three hydras, like those I had formerly seen.

Where they joined, there hangedan Indian loadstone as big as an Egyptian bean, set in gold,having two points, hexagonal, in a right line; and on eachside, towards the wall, hung a handful of scordium (garlicgermander).There our noble lantern desired us not to take it amiss thatshe went no farther with us, leaving us wholly to the conductof the priestess Bacbuc; for she herself was not allowed to goin, for certain causes rather to be concealed than revealed tomortals. However, she advised us to be resolute and secure,and to trust to her for the return. She then pulled the load-stone that hung at the folding of the gates, and threw it into asilver box fixed for that purpose; which done, from the thresh-old of each gate she drew a twine of crimson silk about ninefeet long, by which the scordium hung, and having fastened itto two gold buckles that hung at the sides, she withdrew.Immediately the gates flew open without being touched;not with a creaking or loud harsh noise like that made byheavy brazen gates, but with a soft pleasing murmur thatresounded through the arches of the temple.Pantagruel soon knew the cause of it, having discovered asmall cylinder or roller that joined the gates over the thresh-old, and, turning like them towards the wall on a hard well-polished ophites stone, with rubbing and rolling caused thatharmonious murmur.I wondered how the gates thus opened of themselves tothe right and left, and after we were all got in, I cast my eyebetween the gates and the wall to endeavour to know howthis happened; for one would have thought our kind lanternhad put between the gates the herb aethiopis, which they sayopens some things that are shut. But I perceived that theparts of the gates that joined on the inside were covered withsteel, and just where the said gates touched when they wereopened I saw two square Indian loadstones of a bluish hue,well polished, and half a span broad, mortised in the templewall.

Forthis here was wholly in compartments of precious stones, allin their natural colours: one of red jasper, most charminglyspotted; another of ophites; a third of porphyry; a fourth oflycophthalmy, a stone of four different colours, powderedwith sparks of gold as small as atoms; a fifth of agate, streakedhere and there with small milk-coloured waves; a sixth ofcostly chalcedony or onyx-stone; and another of green jas-per, with certain red and yellowish veins. And all these weredisposed in a diagonal line.At the portico some small stones were inlaid and evenlyjoined on the floor, all in their native colours, to embellish"},{"pageNumber":784,"pageContent":"784Gargantua & Pantagruelthe design of the figures; and they were ordered in such amanner that you would have thought some vine-leaves andbranches had been carelessly strewed on the pavement; forin some places they were thick, and thin in others. That in-laying was very wonderful everywhere. Here were seen, as itwere in the shade, some snails crawling on the grapes; there,little lizards running on the branches. On this side were grapesthat seemed yet greenish; on another, some clusters thatseemed full ripe, so like the true that they could as easilyhave deceived starlings and other birds as those which Zeuxisdrew.Nay, we ourselves were deceived; for where the artist seemedto have strewed the vine-branches thickest, we could not for-bear walking with great strides lest we should entangle ourfeet, just as people go over an unequal stony place.I then cast my eyes on the roof and walls of the temple,that were all pargetted with porphyry and mosaic work, whichfrom the left side at the coming in most admirably repre-sented the battle in which the good Bacchus overthrew theIndians; as followeth.Chapter 5.XXXIX.Chapter 5.XXXIX.Chapter 5.XXXIX.Chapter 5.XXXIX.Chapter 5.XXXIX.HHHHHooooow ww ww ww ww we saw Be saw Be saw Be saw Be saw Bacchusacchusacchusacchusacchus’’’’’s army drawn up in battalia ins army drawn up in battalia ins army drawn up in battalia ins army drawn up in battalia ins army drawn up in battalia inmosaic wormosaic wormosaic wormosaic wormosaic work.k.k.k.k.At the beginning, divers towns, hamlets, castles, fortresses,and forests were seen in flames; and several mad and loosewomen, who furiously ripped up and tore live calves, sheep,and lambs limb from limb, and devoured their flesh. Therewe learned how Bacchus, at his coming into India, destroyedall things with fire and sword.Notwithstanding this, he was so despised by the Indiansthat they did not think it worth their while to stop hisprogress, having been certainly informed by their spies thathis camp was destitute of warriors, and that he had onlywith him a crew of drunken females, a low-built, old, ef-feminate, sottish fellow, continually addled, and as drunk asa wheelbarrow, with a pack of young clownish doddipolls,stark naked, always skipping and frisking up and down, withtails and horns like those of young kids.For this reason the Indians had resolved to let them go"},{"pageNumber":785,"pageContent":"785Rabelaisthrough their country without the least opposition, esteem-ing a victory over such enemies more dishonourable thanglorious.In the meantime Bacchus marched on, burning everything;for, as you know, fire and thunder are his paternal arms, Ju-piter having saluted his mother Semele with his thunder, sothat his maternal house was ruined by fire. Bacchus alsocaused a great deal of blood to be spilt; which, when he isroused and angered, principally in war, is as natural to himas to make some in time of peace.Thus plains of the island of Samos are called Panema, whichsignifies bloody, because Bacchus there overtook the Ama-zons, who fled from the country of Ephesus, and there let‘em blood, so that they all died of phlebotomy. This maygive you a better insight into the meaning of an ancient prov-erb than Aristotle has done in his problems, viz., Why ’twasformerly said, Neither eat nor sow any mint in time of war.The reason is, that blows are given then without any distinc-tion of parts or persons, and if a man that’s wounded hasthat day handled or eaten any mint, ’tis impossible, or atleast very hard, to stanch his blood.After this, Bacchus was seen marching in battalia, ridingin a stately chariot drawn by six young leopards. He lookedas young as a child, to show that all good topers never growold. He was as red as a cherry, or a cherub, which you please,and had no more hair on his chin than there’s in the insideof my hand. His forehead was graced with pointed horns,above which he wore a fine crown or garland of vine-leavesand grapes, and a mitre of crimson velvet, having also giltbuskins on.He had not one man with him that looked like a man; hisguards and all his forces consisted wholly of Bassarides,Evantes, Euhyades, Edonides, Trietherides, Ogygiae,Mimallonides, Maenades, Thyades, and Bacchae, frantic,raving, raging, furious, mad women, begirt with live snakesand serpents instead of girdles, dishevelled, their hair flow-ing about their shoulders, with garlands of vine-branchesinstead of forehead-cloths, clad with stag’s or goat’s skins,and armed with torches, javelins, spears, and halberds whoseends were like pineapples. Besides, they had certain smalllight bucklers that gave a loud sound if you touched ‘emnever so little, and these served them instead of drums.

And pray for the future don’t so much admireApelles, Aristides the Theban, and others who drew claps ofthunder, lightnings, winds, words, manners, and spirits.We then saw the Indian army, who had at last taken thefield to prevent the devastation of the rest of their country.In the front were the elephants, with castles well garrisonedon their backs. But the army and themselves were put intodisorder; the dreadful cries of the Bacchae having filled themwith consternation, and those huge animals turned tail andtrampled on the men of their party.There you might have seen gaffer Silenus on his ass, puttingon as hard as he could, striking athwart and alongst, and lay-ing about him lustily with his staff after the old fashion offencing. His ass was prancing and making after the elephants,gaping and martially braying, as it were to sound a charge, ashe did when formerly in the Bacchanalian feasts he waked thenymph Lottis, when Priapus, full of priapism, had a mind topriapize while the pretty creature was taking a nap.There you might have seen Pan frisk it with his goatishshanks about the Maenades, and with his rustic pipe excitethem to behave themselves like Maenades.A little further you might have blessed your eyes with thesight of a young satyr who led seventeen kings his prisoners;and a Bacchis, who with her snakes hauled along no lessthan two and forty captains; a little faun, who carried a wholedozen of standards taken from the enemy; and goodmanBacchus on his chariot, riding to and fro fearless of danger,making much of his dear carcass, and cheerfully toping to allhis merry friends.Finally, we saw the representation of his triumph, whichwas thus: first, his chariot was wholly lined with ivy gath-ered on the mountain Meros; this for its scarcity, which youknow raises the price of everything, and principally of thoseleaves in India.

Three chains somewhat less,most curiously wrought, hung about two feet and a half be-low it, and in a triangle supported a round plate of fine goldwhose diameter or breadth did not exceed two cubits andhalf a span. There were four holes in it, in each of which anempty ball was fastened, hollow within, and open o’ top,like a little lamp; its circumference about two hands’ breadth.Each ball was of precious stone; one an amethyst, anotheran African carbuncle, the third an opal, and the fourth ananthracites.

In each of them was a flaming wick,partly of asbestine flax, as of old in the temple of JupiterAmmon, such as those which Cleombrotus, a most studiousphilosopher, saw, and partly of Carpasian flax (Ozell’s cor-rection. Motteux reads, ‘which Cleombrotus, a most studi-ous philosopher, and Pandelinus of Carpasium had, whichwere,’ &c.), which were rather renewed than consumed bythe fire.About two foot and a half below that gold plate, the threechains were fastened to three handles that were fixed to alarge round lamp of most pure crystal, whose diameter was acubit and a half, and opened about two hands’ breadths o’top; by which open place a vessel of the same crystal, shapedsomewhat like the lower part of a gourd-like limbec, or anurinal, was put at the bottom of the great lamp, with such aquantity of the afore-mentioned burning water, that the flameof the asbestine wick reached the centre of the great lamp.This made all its spherical body seem to burn and be in aflame, because the fire was just at the centre and middle point,so that it was not more easy to fix the eye on it than on thedisc of the sun, the matter being wonderfully bright andshining, and the work most transparent and dazzling by thereflection of the various colours of the precious stones whereofthe four small lamps above the main lamp were made, andtheir lustre was still variously glittering all over the temple.Then this wandering light being darted on the polishedmarble and agate with which all the inside of the temple waspargetted, our eyes were entertained with a sight of all theadmirable colours which the rainbow can boast when thesun darts his fiery rays on some dropping clouds.The design of the lamp was admirable in itself, but, in myopinion, what added much to the beauty of the whole, wasthat round the body of the crystal lamp there was carved incataglyphic work a lively and pleasant battle of naked boys,mounted on little hobby-horses, with little whirligig lancesand shields that seemed made of vine-branches with grapeson them; their postures generally were very different, andtheir childish strife and motions were so ingeniously expressedthat art equalled nature in every proportion and action.

These were seven in num-ber, according to the number of the angles (This sentence,restored by Ozell, is omitted by Motteux.).Each pillar’s length from the basis to the architraves wasnear seven hands, taking an exact dimension of its diameterthrough the centre of its circumference and inward round-ness; and it was so disposed that, casting our eyes behindone of them, whatever its cube might be, to view its oppo-site, we found that the pyramidal cone of our visual line"},{"pageNumber":791,"pageContent":"791Rabelaisended at the said centre, and there, by the two opposites,formed an equilateral triangle whose two lines divided thepillar into two equal parts.That which we had a mind to measure, going from oneside to another, two pillars over, at the first third part of thedistance between them, was met by their lowermost and fun-damental line, which, in a consult line drawn as far as theuniversal centre, equally divided, gave, in a just partition,the distance of the seven opposite pillars in a right line, be-ginning at the obtuse angle on the brink, as you know thatan angle is always found placed between two others in allangular figures odd in number.This tacitly gave us to understand that seven semidiam-eters are in geometrical proportion, compass, and distancesomewhat less than the circumference of a circle, from thefigure of which they are extracted; that is to say, three wholeparts, with an eighth and a half, a little more, or a seventhand a half, a little less, according to the instructions given usof old by Euclid, Aristotle, Archimedes, and others.The first pillar, I mean that which faced the temple gate,was of azure, sky-coloured sapphire.The second, of hyacinth, a precious stone exactly of thecolour of the flower into which Ajax’s choleric blood wastransformed; the Greek letters A I being seen on it in manyplaces.The third, an anachite diamond, as bright and glitteringas lightning.The fourth, a masculine ruby balas (peach-coloured)amethystizing, its flame and lustre ending in violet or purplelike an amethyst.The fifth, an emerald, above five hundred and fifty timesmore precious than that of Serapis in the labyrinth of theEgyptians, and more verdant and shining than those thatwere fixed, instead of eyes, in the marble lion’s head nearKing Hermias’s tomb.The sixth, of agate, more admirable and various in the dis-tinctions of its veins, clouds, and colours than that whichPyrrhus, King of Epirus, so mightily esteemed.The seventh, of syenites, transparent, of the colour of aberyl and the clear hue of Hymetian honey; and within itthe moon was seen, such as we see it in the sky, silent, full,new, and in the wane."},{"pageNumber":792,"pageContent":"792Gargantua & PantagruelThese stones were assigned to the seven heavenly planetsby the ancient Chaldaeans; and that the meanest capacitiesmight be informed of this, just at the central perpendicularline, on the chapter of the first pillar, which was of sapphire,stood the image of Saturn in elutian (Motteux reads‘Eliacim.’) lead, with his scythe in his hand, and at his feet acrane of gold, very artfully enamelled, according to the na-tive hue of the saturnine bird.On the second, which was of hyacinth, towards the left,Jupiter was seen in jovetian brass, and on his breast an eagleof gold enamelled to the life.On the third was Phoebus of the purest gold, and a whitecock in his right hand.On the fourth was Mars in Corinthian brass, and a lion athis feet.On the fifth was Venus in copper, the metal of whichAristonides made Athamas’s statue, that expressed in a blush-ing whiteness his confusion at the sight of his son Learchus,who died at his feet of a fall.On the sixth was Mercury in hydrargyre. I would havesaid quicksilver, had it not been fixed, malleable, and un-movable. That nimble deity had a stork at his feet.On the seventh was the Moon in silver, with a greyhoundat her feet.The size of these statues was somewhat more than a thirdpart of the pillars on which they stood, and they were soadmirably wrought according to mathematical proportionthat Polycletus’s canon could hardly have stood in competi-tion with them.The bases of the pillars, the chapters, the architraves,zoophores, and cornices were Phrygian work of massive gold,purer and finer than any that is found in the rivers Leedenear Montpellier, Ganges in India, Po in Italy, Hebrus inThrace, Tagus in Spain, and Pactolus in Lydia.The small arches between the pillars were of the same pre-cious stone of which the pillars next to them were. Thus,that arch was of sapphire which ended at the hyacinth pillar,and that was of hyacinth which went towards the diamond,and so on.Above the arches and chapters of the pillars, on the inwardfront, a cupola was raised to cover the fountain. It was sur-rounded by the planetary statues, heptagonal at the bottom,"},{"pageNumber":793,"pageContent":"793Rabelaisand spherical o’ top, and of crystal so pure, transparent, well-polished, whole and uniform in all its parts, without veins,clouds, flaws, or streaks, that Xenocrates never saw such aone in his life.Within it were seen the twelve signs of the zodiac, the twelvemonths of the year, with their properties, the two equinoxes,the ecliptic line, with some of the most remarkable fixedstars about the antartic pole and elsewhere, so curiouslyengraven that I fancied them to be the workmanship of KingNecepsus, or Petosiris, the ancient mathematician.On the top of the cupola, just over the centre of the foun-tain, were three noble long pearls, all of one size, pear fash-ion, perfectly imitating a tear, and so joined together as torepresent a flower-de-luce or lily, each of the flowers seem-ing above a hand’s breadth. A carbuncle jetted out of its ca-lyx or cup as big as an ostrich’s egg, cut seven square (thatnumber so beloved of nature), and so prodigiously gloriousthat the sight of it had like to have made us blind, for thefiery sun or the pointed lightning are not more dazzling andunsufferably bright.Now, were some judicious appraisers to judge of the valueof this incomparable fountain, and the lamp of which wehave spoke, they would undoubtedly affirm it exceeds thatof all the treasures and curiosities in Europe, Asia, and Africaput together. For that carbuncle alone would have darkenedthe pantarbe of Iarchus (Motteux reads ‘Joachas.’) the In-dian magician, with as much ease as the sun outshines anddims the stars with his meridian rays.Nor let Cleopatra, that Egyptian queen, boast of her pairof pendants, those two pearls, one of which she caused to bedissolved in vinegar, in the presence of Antony the Triumvir,her gallant.Or let Pompeia Plautina be proud of her dress covered allover with emeralds and pearls curiously intermixed, she whoattracted the eyes of all Rome, and was said to be the pit andmagazine of the conquering robbers of the universe.The fountain had three tubes or channels of right pearl,seated in three equilateral angles already mentioned, extendedon the margin, and those channels proceeded in a snail-likeline, winding equally on both sides.We looked on them a while, and had cast our eyes on an-other side, when Bacbuc directed us to watch the water. We"},{"pageNumber":794,"pageContent":"794Gargantua & Pantagruelthen heard a most harmonious sound, yet somewhat stoppedby starts, far distant, and subterranean, by which means it wasstill more pleasing than if it had been free, uninterrupted, andnear us, so that our minds were as agreeably entertained throughour ears with that charming melody as they were through thewindows of our eyes with those delightful objects.Bacbuc then said, Your philosophers will not allow that mo-tion is begot by the power of figures; look here, and see thecontrary. By that single snail-like motion, equally divided asyou see, and a fivefold infoliature, movable at every inwardmeeting, such as is the vena cava where it enters into the rightventricle of the heart; just so is the flowing of this fountain,and by it a harmony ascends as high as your world’s ocean.She then ordered her attendants to make us drink; and, totell you the truth of the matter as near as possible, we arenot, heaven be praised! of the nature of a drove of calf-lollies,who (as your sparrows can’t feed unless you bob them on thetail) must be rib-roasted with tough crabtree and firked into astomach, or at least into an humour to eat or drink. No, weknow better things, and scorn to scorn any man’s civility whocivilly invites us to a drinking bout. Bacbuc asked us then howwe liked our tiff. We answered that it seemed to us good harm-less sober Adam’s liquor, fit to keep a man in the right way,and, in a word, mere element; more cool and clear thanArgyrontes in Aetolia, Peneus in Thessaly, Axius in Mygdonia,or Cydnus in Cilicia, a tempting sight of whose cool silverstream caused Alexander to prefer the short-lived pleasure ofbathing himself in it to the inconveniences which he couldnot but foresee would attend so ill-termed an action.This, said Bacbuc, comes of not considering with ourselves,or understanding the motions of the musculous tongue, whenthe drink glides on it in its way to the stomach. Tell me,noble strangers, are your throats lined, paved, or enamelled,as formerly was that of Pithyllus, nicknamed Theutes, thatyou can have missed the taste, relish, and flavour of this di-vine liquor?

Is this all that thetrismegistian Bottle’s word means? I’ troth, I like it extremely;it went down like mother’s milk. Nothing more, returnedBacbuc; for Trinc is a panomphean word, that is, a word un-derstood, used and celebrated by all nations, and signifies drink.Some say in your world that sack is a word used in alltongues, and justly admitted in the same sense among allnations; for, as Aesop’s fable hath it, all men are born with asack at the neck, naturally needy and begging of each other;neither can the most powerful king be without the help ofother men, or can anyone that’s poor subsist without therich, though he be never so proud and insolent; as, for ex-ample, Hippias the philosopher, who boasted he could doeverything. Much less can anyone make shift without drinkthan without a sack. Therefore here we hold not that laugh-ing, but that drinking is the distinguishing character of man.I don’t say drinking, taking that word singly and absolutelyin the strictest sense; no, beasts then might put in for a share;I mean drinking cool delicious wine. For you must know,my beloved, that by wine we become divine; neither canthere be a surer argument or a less deceitful divination.
