In it the author provides a critical edition of substantial parts of a key work, the Kitab al-Ahjdr caid Ray Balinds, in the group of 144 treatises known as the Kutub al-Mawazin or \"Books of Balances.\" In it, as Dr. Haq meticulously expounds the theory, Jabir describes his ideas about the numerical and phonetic substructure of pure and compound materials, and about the ways to analyze these substructures by manipulating the consonants in the names of the materials in the Arabic language and, in principle at least, in other languages including the artificial. Dr. Haq's treatment of the Kitab al-Ahjdr is preceded by a chapter in which he, following the lead of a few other scholars, raises serious questions about the conclusions cdncerning Jabir that Paul Kraus arrived at fifty years ago: that one individual did not write all of the nearly 3000 works that Arabic tradition allowed Kraus to attribute to Jabir, but that these texts were composed by the members of a school over several generations; and that the corpus Jabirianum does not date from the latter half of the second century Hijra/eighth century A.D., when Jabir is alleged to have been active, but from a period between 875 and 975 A.D. Some of Dr. Haq's arguments are not convincing; e.g., it seems to me irrelevant to the question of whether or not one man could have composed all of the 3000 works that only some 500 can be individually named. One need only remark that the great collections of One Hundred and Twelve Books, of Seventy Books, and of Five Hundred Books, combined with the 144 Kutub al-Mawazin and the minor collections, already account for about 950 treatises. Certainly the corpus may have consisted of far fewer than 3000 items, as Kraus realized, since many of the known titles may belong to one or another of these large collections, but it must have contained at least 2000 treatises. Still, the arguments put forth by Dr. Haq in favor of taking seriously the historicity of Jabir as a disciple of the sixth Shici Imam Jacfar al-Sadiq are compelling; and some of Kraus' arguments in favor of his dating of the corpus are based upon very uncertain foundations. ix"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"X FOREWORD Dr. Haq's solution is to regard the questions of the author or authors and of his or their dates as unanswerable. But there are some things that point to a date closer to 900 than to 800 A.D. For instance, \"Jabir\" wrote a book entitled Kitab al-Nawdmis wa al-Radd 'aid Iflatun (Kraus 1981), in which, as we know from citations in the Kitab al-Sumiim and the Kitab al-Tajmi'-, he attacked a magical tract, the Kitab al-Nawdmis, falsely ascribed to Plato. We have a Latin translation of this pseudo-Platonic work, the Liber vacce, from which it is clear that the author used Hunayn ibn Ishaq's translation of Galen's On the Opinions of Plato and Hippocrates, which was made in the 840's. Even in the Kitab al-Ahjdr itself there are hints of a probable ninth century date—e.g., the geometrical definitions and vocabulary on ff. 78a-78b (published from the Paris manuscript by Kraus in his Jabir ibn Hayyan. Textes choisis, Paris-Le Caire 1935, pp. 184 and 186-187, but omitted from Haq's critical edition) and the discussion in section 35 of Dr. Haq's edited text of the Neoplatonic cosmology of the Sabians of Harran. In both cases, while absolute proof is impossible, it seems to me more likely than not that these passages were written decades after 800 A.D. One possible solution to this problem is that advanced by P. Lory (Gdbir ibn Hayyan. L'elaboration de I'elixir supreme, Damas 1988, pp. 12-13): \". . . a un noyau primitif de textes alchimiques a caractere essentiellement technique, des commentateurs plus tardifs auraient ajoute des gloses et des explications doctrinales. L'ensemble aurait ^te repris et encadre par des notations bibliographiques attestant l'origine gabirienne et/ou gacfarienne de chaque texte, anisi que sa place dans l'ensemble du Corpus.\" The text itself of the Kitab al-Ahjar is preserved in five manuscripts. The present location of one of these that Kraus {Jabir ibn Hayyan. Contribution a I'histoire des idees scientifiques dans I'Islam, vol. I, Le Caire 1943, p. 180) had located in a bookstore in Damascus is unknown, and one of the two copies in Teheran is either a copy or a gemellus of the other. Kraus, in his publication of excerpts from this work (all of parts 1 and 2 and a part of part 4), used only the Paris manuscript. Dr. Haq has collated all three, and presents us with an authoritative critical edition of excerpts from all four parts (unfortunately he could not at this time achieve a critical edition of the whole treatise) including the third, in which he has discovered an early translation—or rather, an expanded paraphrase—of part of Aristotle's Categories. He is indeed to be FOREWORD congratulated on this achievement, as on his successful effort to unravel and explain this obscure discourse on the Jabirian theory of balances. Much remains to be done in the field of Jabirian studies, as in the larger field it opens into, of the sources and the development of \"scientific\" ideas in early Islam. I am delighted to be able to welcome a brilliant young scholar dedicated to improving and building on the foundations so ably laid by Paul Kraus. November, 1992 David E. Pingree Professor of the History of Mathematics Brown University Providence, Rhode Island \\"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"AUTHOR'S PREFACE This study, in its original version, constituted my doctoral dissertation which I presented some years ago to London University. Now that it is appearing in print, and thus places upon my shoulders a different kind of responsibility, it has been revised and extended. It seems to me that by making these changes and additions I have gained a wider audience. For now this work should be read with benefit not only by experts in the narrow specialty of the history of mediaeval science and medicine, but also by those whose interests lie in mediaeval philosophy, in the history of religion and in the general area of the intellectual history of Islam. By adding much explanatory material and presupposing very little on the part of the reader, I have also aimed at making this study accessible to students in these fields. In a sense, this book may be regarded as consisting of two parts. The first chapter in which I have ventured to reexamine the notorious \"Jabir-Problem\" is an integral but self-contained part of the whole and can be read independently in its own right. The remaining bulk of the book may be considered its second part. This comprises of five chapters which together constitute a critical study of the Kitab al-Abjdr '•aid Ray Balinas (Book of Stones According to the Opinion of Balinas) attributed to the alchemist Jabir ibn Hayyan. Naturally, these latter chapters are not meant for reading in isolation from one another, nor will they make much sense if read in an order other than the one in which they appear. But the two parts of the book are not mutually independent. Indeed, it is one of my fundamental messages to the reader that the vexed question of the authorship and dating of the Jabirian corpus, a feverishly debated issue dubbed \"Jabir-Problem\" by an earlier generation, is neither trivia] nor irrelevant. Yielding profound methodological consequences, it is a question that determines in most fundamental ways our very approach to Jabirian writings. In search of a methodology, then, I begin by subjecting to a critical reexamination what is by now an orthodox scholarly position on this issue. This is the position based on the compelling thesis of Paul Kraus that the Jabirian corpus, with the possible exception of one treatise, was written not by a single individual xiii"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"XIV PREFACE of the 2nd/8th century as tradition has it, but by several generations of a group of ShlcI authors who lived no earlier than the latter half of the century that followed. Having tentatively concluded that this thesis is problematic, I have refrained from committing myself to the methodological imperatives it begets. But I have not dismissed Kraus' thesis; rather, in my approach to Jabirian writings, I have remained systematically indifferent to it. With these methodological considerations I proceed with my study of the Ahjar. Thus begins the second and main part of the book. Here, operating with the guidelines constructed in the first part, I identify certain fundamental notions of Jabir's system and examine how they function within the internal perspective of his cosmological, alchemical and philosophical doctrines as these latter are developed in the Ahjar. Thus, I have reconstructed the doctrinal context of this treatise, expounded its central theme, and presented a critical edition of its thematically selected Arabic text. In the final chapter, I translate my edition in its entirety and provide extensive commentaries and textual notes. The contents of the excluded sections of the treatise appear in an appendix at the end of the book. It will be seen that at the core of the Ahjar lies a powerful idea of an ontological equivalence between language and physical reality. Language, we are told, did not merely depict the natural world, it was an embodiment of reality itself; indeed, language signified being. Therefore, an analysis of language was effectively an anlysis of the objects of the world. To know a thing was to know its name. Thus develops our author an all-embracing theoretical system, providing his logical proofs, explicating the consequences of his claims, and applying his system to numerous actual cases. I do hope my account throws into sharp relief the enormous range of this system, its surprising logical coherence and its undeniable philosophical worth. In the second part of the book I also announce and present a textual discovery of mine. I do so somewhat boastfully since this is the discovery of a hitherto unknown translation of the 8th discourse of Aristotle's Categoriae, a text of which only one mediaeval Arabic translation is known to us—namely that by Ishaq ibn Hunayn. The discovery now of another Arabic rendering should delight the scholars of Arabic Aristotle since here we have something rather promising. This text, which I found in the hitherto unstudied part of the Ahjar; appears as an integral part of my critical edition in Chapter 5; in Chapter 6 it has been translated, PREFACE textually analyzed, and terminologically compared both with the text of Aristotle as well as that of Ishaq. Let me now say a word concerning my criticism of Kraus. This criticism, no matter how animated it may appear, is not meant to belittle the grand scholarship of this erudite historian. Kraus was, I acknowledge, one of the most outstanding scholars of his field and his contributions to Jabirian studies are no less than monumental. To him I owe an enormous debt, for throughout this book I draw heavily upon his learned and rigorous works. Yet I do mean-to point out the inherent dangers that lie in an uncritical espousal of his views. As I have demonstrated, such blind following sometimes obscures more than it illuminates. Indeed, I feel that my textual discovery of the Jabirian translation of Aristotle is a fruit of a critical stance toward Kraus. This is so because the existence of an Aristotle-like discourse in a text of Jabir would have hardly constituted a problem for a researcher unreservedly committed to Kraus' late dating of the Jabirian corpus. Finally, I dare say that despite my painstaking efforts to verify my facts, and despite my numerous readings of the manuscript of this book, errors might still have gone unnoticed. I appeal to my readers to point these out. And now, as I look forward to criticisms and appraisals of this endeavor of mine, I wish to assure the experts that I am not unaware of the many shortcomings and imperfections of this work, nor do I place it before them without haunting trepidation, nay, even reluctance.

To begin with, there are doubts as to his very historical existence. But then, even if this question is glossed over, the enigma is hardly simplified for it is not at all clear if a historical Jabir is the real author of that extensive corpus which passes under his name. Thus, the interlocked questions of the authorship and dating of this labyrinth of alchemical writings have remained a matter of seriously conflicting opinions and speculations. The task of solving what came to be known as the \"Jabir-Problem\"2 is further complicated by the remarkable paucity of critical studies of Jabirian treatises. As a result, much darkness looms over the actual substance and range of these writings and their historical and philosophical sources. In fact, since Paul Kraus' magnum opus, completed by 1943, these questions have largely been abandoned in a mist of controversy.3 What makes this problem even deeper is the fact that controversy over Jabir haunts the very tradition that has come down to us. As early as around 360/970, barely 170 years after the supposed date of Jabir's death, the philosopher' Abu Sulayman al-Mantiql in his Ta^aliq considered Jabirian works apocryphal, the true author of which, he claims, is one al-Hasan ibn al-Nakad al-Mawsill whom he knew personally.4 Later on, in the 8th/14th century, we see, for example, a critic of the history of Arabic literature, Jamal al-Din ibn Nubata al-Misri, explicitly declaring that all writings attributed to Jabir are of doubtful authenticity. ^ And, in the earliest preserved biography of Jabir, its generally reliable author Ibn al-Nadlm (d. 344/955) records a lucid report about the prevalent controversies and doubts in an early period not only over the question of the authenticity of the Jabirian corpus, but also concerning the very historical existence of its alleged author.6 But Ibn al-Nadlm himself belongs to the opposite side in this contro-versy, dismissing all doubts emphatically and categorically: \"Jabir did exist,\" he writes in the Fihrist, \"his case is certain and famous, his compositions being most important and numerous.\"7 On the same side is Ibn Wahshiyya (b. second half 3rd/9th century),8 invoking the 3"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"4 CHAPTER 1 authority of Jabir in his Kanz al-Hikma (Treasure of Wisdom)9 and mentioning the Jabirian Kitab al-Sumum (Book of Poisons, Kr 2145) in his own work of the same title. \"Jabir ibn Hayyan al-Sufi['s] . . . book on poisons,\" we read in Ibn Wahshiyya's Sumum, \"is a great work. ... It is a wonder.\"10 Restricting ourselves to this earlier period, we have, likewise, the three major alchemists, al-Razi (d. 313/925),11 al-Majritx (Jl. mid 4th/1 Oth century)12 and Ibn Umayl (d. c. 349/960);13 the author Abu Hanlfa al-Dlnawari (d. c. 282/895);14 and the historians Ibn Tahir al-MaqdisI (Jl. mid 4th/10th century)15 and Sacid al-Andalusi (d. 462/1070)16—all of whom in one way or another refer to Jabir, with no implications in their accounts either that his historicity or that the authenticity of the Jabirian corpus is in any sense a problematic issue requiring explanation. Turning to our own times, we see that during the thousand years which separate us from Ibn al-Nadim the whole Jabir question has become even more obscure and elusive. For, in addition to the conflicts in the tradition, the modern historian must now contend with yet another puzzle that has in the meantime developed: are the Arabic Jabir and the Latin Geber identical? The writings ascribed to this Geber, in particular the Summa perfectionis, have been known in the Latin West since the early middle ages, for a long time considered to have been translations of the Arabic works of Jabir.17 Indeed, the classical editions of the Geberian texts reinforced this view in which the author is variously described as \"The Most Famous Arabian Prince and Philosopher,\"18 \"King of the Arabs,\"19 \"King of the Persians,\"20 and, in a rare incunabulum, even as \"King of India.\"21 But with the publication in 1869 of Hermann Kopp's Beitrage zur Geschichte der Chemie,22 the scholarly world realized that the identification of Geber with Jabir may well be an oversimplification; for Kopp had announced that he was unable to find any bibliographic trace of Arabic originals of the Latin Geberian texts, and that upon a philological examination by an Arabist, the latter showed no clear signs of having been translated from Arabic. Thus, the same sorts of questions which had troubled the Arabic bio-bibliographers of Jabir were now faced by the Western scholars of Geber, and much worse: given the Jabir/Geber identity in the Latin tradition, the scions of Arabic historians can no longer resolve the Geber issue in isolation from the Jabir issue, nor, indeed, can the latter be settled without addressing the former. With INTRODUCTION 5 a new puzzle added, the modern era of the Jabir-Problem has now been ushered in. THE JABIRIAN CORPUS: SCOPE AND PECULIARITIES Unfortunately, all these problems are further compounded by the internal complications of the Jabirian corpus, a corpus that resists easy accessibility. A formidable difficulty, for example, is presented by the enormously wide scope of these writings. \"No alchemical work of Islam,\" to quote one authority, \"reveals such vast knowledge of ancient literature or has such an encyclopedic character.\"23 Thus, on the one hand, these writings deal with the theory and practice of chemical processes and procedures, classification of substances, medicine, pharmacology, astrology, theurgy, magic, the doctrine of specific property of things (cIlm al-Khawdss), and the artificial generation of living beings;24 all interspersed with discourses on philosophy, logic, mathematics, natural and artificial languages, music, and cosmology. And, on the other hand, many parts of the corpus bear a thoroughly religio-political character in which the chiliastic cosmology of proto-ShlcI gnosis constitues the author's subject matter; here one finds discourses on the occultation of the Imam and his messianic return, on the unfolding of the Shici hiero-history, and on the politically charged question of the leadership of the Muslim community. The authorities cited, invoked or quoted are equally numerous and diversified. Thus one finds in the corpus references not only to ancient historical or legendary writers such as Zosimus,25 Democritus,26 Hermes,27 Agathodemon,28 etc., but also cited therein Socrates29 and Plato,30 and quotations from all parts of Aristotle's works,31 as well as from the commentaries of Alexander of Aphrodisias,32 Themistius,33 Simplicius34 and Porphyry.35 Galen is found to be extensively quoted,36 and Archimedes and Euclid are not only referred to, but—like Socrates, Plato, Aristotle and Balinas (Apollonius of Tyana), etc.—a separate treatise is devoted to each one of them.37 In addition, the Kitab al-Hasil (Book of the Result, Kr 323) preserves a long extract from the Placita philosophorum of ps-Plutarch.38 And, of course, throughout the Jabirian corpus one comes across numerous references to the sixth ShlcI Imam Jacfar al-Sadiq (d. 147/765) who is claimed to be the author's teacher and"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"6 CHAPTER 1 lord, the Master under whose direct guidance the author had composed his works.39 Given this tremendous vastness of the scope of Jabirian writings, a fuller and intelligible picture of their contents is not easily drawn. It is clear, for example, that these writings have to be approached from at least two different angles: (a) from the perspective of the religious history of Islam; and (b) as a problem of the history of science. But in either case one has to grope in darkness, for just as the early history of alchemy is wrapped in obscurity, so are the historic origins of the ShicI sects in Islam. Both these areas are fraught with controversies and chaos as we will have occasion to see below. But there are other problems associated with the Jabirian corpus, and this leads us to the second difficulty, namely the difficulty of making sense of the language of these writings. To be sure, the author avoids obscure allegories so typical of the Hellenistic alchemists and even of some later Muslim alchemical writers such as Ibn Umayl or Dhu'l-Nun al-Misri (d. 245/859). But his style is often crude and uneven, frequently violating syntactical rules. More critical, however, is the problem of the technical terms in the corpus for which our standard lexicographic aids prove to be seriously inadequate. Thus to make sense of Jabir's scientific language, one has to go through the laborious process of seeking help from what we have of the works of other Arabic alchemists, toxicologists, pharmaceutical naturalists, etc. But this may not be a good methodology after all, for if Jabir is the first alchemist of Islam—a possibility we cannot overrule—then to seek illumination from later writings would constitute a reverse process which cannot help us much in settling the question particularly of the dating of the corpus. And as for the earlier alchemical writings, they can hardly throw any light on Jabir for they are diemselves wrapped in a thicker blanket of obscurity. Third, there is this difficulty of Jabir's peculiar brand of \"esotericism.\" As it is generally known, alchemy has traditionally been a secret practice. Thus, at many places in the corpus we read warnings of the author's alleged master Ja'far that these writings should never be allowed to fall into the hands of the unworthy or the irresponsible.40 But quite unlike the ancient practice of using cover names and allegories, Jabir's \"esotericism\" consists in what he calls tabdid al-Hlm, the Principle of Dispersion of Knowledge: truth was never to be revealed completely at one place. Rather, it was the aim of the author to cut it up and, like so many pieces of a jigsaw puzzle, spread it all over the maze of a vast I NTRODUCTION 7 corpus.41 Therefore, no single treatise was complete by itself—by definition, each remained fragmentary. The author always insists that the reader ought to refer to other works in order to get the whole meaning of what is being treated of in the treatise under consideration; other works urge the reader to consult yet others; and so on.42 Full of copious bibliographic references to its own works, the corpus also gives clear instructions as to the order in which its different writings are to be looked at; it even specifies the number of times each one them should be read.43 Strictly speaking, then, one needs to have before oneself the entire body of Jabirian writings if the whole truth of the author's teaching is sought. And while it is in principle possible to reconstitute his corpus and to complete the picture, in practice it remains an impossible task. The application of the Principle of Dispersion of Knowledge may also explain the fact that in the same treatise, without contextual justification, the author often deals with vastly disparate subject matters.44 Thus, all individual writings of the Jabirian corpus are full of digressions, shifts of perspectives, discontinuities and half truths: these features present difficulties of a serious order. Finally, one is confronted with the problem of an irritating lack of consistency in the Jabirian corpus. Thus, in the classification of substances, for example, mercury is at one time counted among spirits45 and, at another time, among metals;46 substituting for it sometimes \"glass\" (zujajY7 and sometimes the chinese alloy kharsini,48 Also, sometimes the status of mercury is specified categorically as in the above cases, and sometimes equivocally: \"There is uncertainty concerning mercury,\" writes Jabir in the Kitab Ustuquss al-Uss (Book of the Element of Foundation, Kr 6-9), \"it is a spirit with spirits, and a soul with souls.\"49 Similarly, in the Kitab al-SabHn (LXX Books, Kr 123-192), in the vein of a numerological speculation, a special status is accorded to the number 18; whereas in the Kutub al-Mawazin (Books of Balances, Kr 303-446) the number 17 is declared as the foundation of everything in the natural world.50 These inconsistencies are not easy to explain— and yet the onus of explanation must remain on the historian."},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"8 CHAPTER 1 THE THESIS OF PAUL KRAUS AND ITS METHODOLOGICAL IMPLICATIONS How does one steer through these defeating external and internal complications that surround the figure of Jabir ibn Hayyan and the body of his writings? In seeking an answer to this question we can hardly turn to a scholar more erudite in this field than Paul Kraus whose monumental study of 1942-43 was a major breakthrough in Jabirian studies.51 Indeed, historians such as Holmyard and, in more recent times, Fuat Sezgin have found reasons to challenge not only Kraus' conclusions but his very approach,52 yet this does not reduce the validity of his work. In fact, so comprehensive and so learned is his study that it provides the scope of its own refutation, and those who criticize him draw upon the raw material that he himself provides. Thus it hardly seems possible to begin a subsequent study of Jabir without accepting Paul Kraus as the major guide, and without recognizing his findings as a firmly established starting point. After investigating at a grand scale the Jabirian corpus and the bio-bibliographic traditions built around it, Kraus had reached two radical conclusions which, if accepted, make the task of the historian much simpler. His first conclusion, to be found nowhere in our modern or classical sources, concerns the question of the authorship of corpus: with the possible exception of the Kitab al-Rahma al-Kabir (Great Book of Mercy, Kr 5), says Kraus, these writings are the work not of a single individual but of several generations of a group of authors sharing certain philosophical, ideological and political concerns. Kraus' second conclusion, which ultimately derives from a hunch of Berthelot,53 is equally radical: the writings ascribed to Jabir were not composed in the 2nd/8th century. Rather, they are the products of a later period, the oldest part dating at the earliest from the second half of the 3rd/9th century.54 The methodological implications of Kraus' thesis have a number of very attractive features: if many hands of many successive generations were involved in the production of the Jabirian corpus, then no longer do we need to undertake the difficult task of explaining all the trouble-some gaps, inconsistencies and all the non-uniformities that are found in it—a plurality of authors provides a sufficient explanation and relieves us of this burden. Likewise, by shifting the dates of these writings into, so to speak, broad daylight when scientific activity in Islam was being carried INTRODUCTION 9 out openly under court patronage, we do away with the need to go into the obscure literature of an earlier century in order to reconstruct the historical context of Jabirian ideas. Thus, on Kraus' view, we will be perfectly justified in consulting the writings of the alchemists such as al-RazI and Ibn Umayl to annotate Jabirian texts; this will involve no anachronism. From the point of view of the historian's relief, another favorable methodological implication of the late dating of the corpus is the fact that it renders unproblematic the Jabirian familiarity with the vast scope of the Greek scientific and philosophical literature. If the writings ascribed to Jabir were composed in the second half of the 3rd/9th century and later, then no problem is presented by the fact that they contain quotations from, for example, the works of Aristotle—by this time translations of Greek works into Arabic had already become a full-scale activity and the Abbasid Caliph al-Ma'mun (198/813-223/833) had established in Baghdad his celebrated Bayt al-Hikma. Thus, the contents of the Jabirian corpus do not demand a fresh examination of our long-held modern views concerning the history of the transmission of foreign ideas into Islam, nor can these writings be taken to throw any new light on this phenomenon.55 Given all these attractive features of Kraus' theory, it is small wonder that the bulk of modern-day scholars chooses to accept it. Thus, when Alfred Siggel learnt that in a discourse on the anatomy of the eye, the Jabirian text Kitab Ikhraj ma fi^l-Quwwa ila^l-Fi'l (Book of the Passage of Potentiality to Actuality, Kr 331) speaks of three moistures (rutubat) and seven layers (tabaqdt),56 representing an advance over the belief of the Christian physician Yuhanna bar Masawayh (b. 161/777), he disposed of it by saying that the Ikhraj must be dependent on the works of Hunayn ibn Ishaq (d. 264/877).57 If Siggel had not accepted the late dating of Kraus, Jabir's anatomical knowledge would have opened up a whole set of challenging questions for him. Similar is the case of another historian of Arabic science, Martin Plessner, who strongly criticized Fuat Sezgin for his suggestions that it would be more fruitful, though at the same time more challenging, to take a relatively conservative approach to Jabir than the one shaped by the views of Kraus.58 But the temptation to follow Kraus uncritically must be curbed: for if, the writings ascribed to Jabir were, after all, composed in the 2nd/8th century, then we have in them a whole literary treasure which can tell us much about the period of transition of Islam from its classical to its"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"10 CHAPTER 1 mediaeval phase—that is, a transition from the times when the heritage of ancient learning had not been systematically appropriated, to an era of intense translation activity and burgeoning cultivation of natural sciences. Many questions pertaining to this transitional period still remain—questions concerning the role of the Harranians, the dissemination of Hermetic ideas, the origins and assimilation of pseudo-Greek works, the nature and channels of Oriental influences, and so on.59 Jabirian texts tell us something about all of these questions and can serve as a valuable source if they are not later compilations. Again, if Jabirian treatises are not to be shunned as later apocrypha, they may well be recognized as comprehending a mine of information for the religious historian: the confused mess of eschatological speculations, the discourses on the metaphysics of Prophethood and Imamate, the surveys of a heavy religio-political melee, the alphabetical symbolism, the pronouncement of prophecies—all these features of Jabir's religious writings reflect the turmoils of the proto-Shici ethos in Islam. But to make use of Jabir as a major source in our search for the origins of sectarian Shicism, we must first critically reexamine Kraus' positive identification of the authorship and dating of the Jabirian corpus. Indeed, an uncritical and thoroughgoing espousal of Kraus has sometimes led not only to futile exercises but also, embarrassingly, to erroneous generalizations. For example, in the vein of his unreserved support for Kraus' late dating of the Jabirian corpus, Plessner—a highly respectable scholar indeed—once declared that \"Jabir always uses the scientific language as perfected by Hunayn ibn Ishaq and his pupils. . . .\"60 But this is false. Similarly, as I have shown elsewhere, a recent comparative study of the Jabirian corpus and the well-known RasdHl (Epistles) of the Ikhwan al-Safa5 (Brethern of Purity; established c. 373/983) turned out to be fruitless—another'unfortunate result of a dogmatic acceptance of Kraus' thesis together with its far-reaching methodological implications.61 A PRELIMINARY CRITICISM OF KRAUS It is evidently beyond the scope of the present work to attempt an exhaustive examination of the evidence and reasoning which constitute the grounds of Kraus' thesis. Thus the criticism that follows remains preliminary and tentative. It aims merely at a summary investigation of INTRODUCTION 11 some of the major arguments of Kraus, and claims to go no further than stating a first result. 1. On the Size and Unevenness of the Corpus Kraus presents two main arguments to support his theory of a group authorship of the Jabirian corpus. The first argument concerns what came to be regarded as the \"immense\" and \"fantastic\"62 size of the collective body of these writings; while the second is based on a consider-ation of the fragmentary nature of its individual treatises which arises out of the Jabirian practice of the principle of tabdid al-^ilm and which results in a corpus marred by a thorough and deliberate unevenness. In his census of the writings belonging to the Jabirian corpus, Kraus had enumerated 2982 works.63 For an individual author this is an enormous figure indeed. Thus, Kraus argued, \"the great number of works [constituting the corpus] renders the hypothesis probable that they are not due to a single author.\"64 And again, . . the attribution of thousands of treatises to a single author of the 2nd/8th century contradicts all the ideas which have been formed concerning the evolution of Arabic literature.\"65 These arguments appear to be sound too. But does the Jabirian corpus contain literally 2982 works? And precisely how large are these works? When we examine these questions, the whole picture changes drastically: 1. The enumeration of Jabirian writings does not run continuously in Kraus' census. Thus, for example, from the number 500 a leap is made to the number 530 with nothing in between;66 the number 532 in the census is followed by 553, and the interval from 533 to 552 is not accounted for;67 no titles correspond to the numbers 554 to 62968 or from 1751 to 1777;69 and so on. Kraus' counting of Jabir's treatises, then, is full of numerous large vacancies which were introduced out of consideration either of the internal indications of the corpus, or of the Arabic bibliographers' rough estimates of the wealth of literature. When we deduct these vacancies, the total number of titles restituted by Kraus reduces to a little over 500—an abysmal drop from 2982! 2. In the census of Kraus each section or part of a single treatise has been counted separately as an independent work. Thus, the single treatise, the Kitab al-Jumal a l-^Ishrin 70(Book of Twenty Maxims, Kr 338-357), has been counted as twenty works; the lost al-Arba'un Kitab (Forty Books, Kr 1101-1140) as forty works; the Kitab al-Ahjdr,"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"12 CHAPTER 1 which is in four parts, appears as four works (Kr 307-310); to the three parts of the Kitab Ustuquss al-Uss, three different numbers have been assigned (Kr 6-8), and the commentary that follows it receives another separate counting (Kr 9). Such examples can easily be multiplied. It is evident that Kraus' total of 2982 is not only inflated, it has also been arrived at through a very liberal method of enumeration. 3. Many of the Jabirian works reckoned to be complete independent treatises barely occupy a single leaf in the manuscripts. The entire Kitab al-Sahl (Book of Facility, Kr 947) consists only of one paragraph—it begins and ends on one half of folio 64 of MS Paris 5099. The Kitab al-Nur (Book of the Light, Kr 17) claims but one folio (no. 183) in the same manuscript. This Paris manuscript also contains the Kitab al-Qadir (Book of the Powerful, Kr 530) which occupies the second half of folio 66 and the first half of the following folio 67; in MS Teheran, Danishgah 491, the text of the Qadir begins on the first half of folio 141 and ends-on that of 142. Again, in MS Paris 2606, for example, the lengths of the Kitab al-Wahid al-Kabir (Great Book of the Unique, Kr 11) and the Kitab al-Wahid al-Saghir (Small Book of the Unique, Kr 12) are, respectively, three folios, and two folios and a half (f. 92b - f. 94b, and f. 94b - f. 96a). Most of the treatises in the corpus are smilarly very small. The LXX Books consist of 225 folios in MS Jarullah 1554. Each folio has the dimension 19.5 cm x 13.5 cm, containing 15 lines per page. This means that, on the average, the length of each treatise in this collection is just over three folios. Likewise, if we add all the folios of different manuscripts which comprise another collection entitled Kitab al-Khams Mi^a (500 Books, Kr 447-946), the total would barely go beyond 120.71 The 500 Books, then, do not even occupy 500 folios. Other collections of the corpus similarly turn out to be much smaller than an uncritical glance at the census of Kraus would lead us to believe.72 This rough investigation makes it abundantly clear that we should view with a great deal of suspicion any arguments for a plurality of authors which is based on Kraus' inflated estimate of the volume of the Jabirian corpus. But Kraus has another argument to support his thesis: \"Despite one's constant efforts,\" he writes, \"to impress upon the [Jabirian] corpus a homogeneous character, we find each time gaps and contradictions INTRODUCTION 13 which can only be explained by an evolution in time [extending over several generations of writers].\"73 The practice of tabdid al-cilm provided further evidence—\"could we not imagine,\" asks Kraus, \"that the bibliographic indications [which are found practically in all individual Jabirian treatises] . . . and such extravagant use of the principle of tabdid al-'-ilm are called upon not only to assure us of the literary unity of the corpus, but also to conceal the gaps which exist between its various parts? When in each collection Jabir declares that the preceding collections present the science in an incomplete . . . form, and that they need to be complemented by a new explanation, isn't that a very ingenious means to allow a [constant] addition of new treatises and new collections to the original stock?\"74 Kraus goes on to say that besides all these indications of a collective authorship, he has found conclusive evidence— \"The fluctuations in the classification of naturally occuring substances which one finds between one collection and another is a conclusive argument in favor of a plurality of authors.\"75 Yet it is ironic that Kraus' own position on this issue fluctuates. Elsewhere he had observed that the Jabirian writings \"have certain stylistic and linguistic properties in common,\" and—at least from this point of view—they were so interlinked that \"it is impossible to pick out [from these writings] any single work and declare it fake without proposing that the whole collection is spurious.\"76 And as for the doctrinal uniformity of the corpus, one discovers from Kraus' own comprehensive sudy that in various Jabirian writings \"allscientific details are woven into a coherent system and it is the latter which gives them meaning and justification. Philosophical reasoning is the starting point of all these writings. . . . Again and again, emphasis is laid on the idea that in science practice (camal) can lead to nowhere unless theory {Him, qiyas, burhdn) has had its due.\"77 Given the stylistic homogeneity of the Jabirian corpus on the one hand, and its substantive coherence on the other, the argument for a collective authorship loses much of its force. What about the thematic and stylistic continuity through the various independent collections of the corpus? Kraus admits that \"the differences of doctrine and style between [the four major collections, namely] the CX1I Books and the LXX Books on the one hand, and the Kutub al-Mawazin [KM] and the 500 Books on the other, are not great enough for one to admit that the two groups of writings were composed with more than 100 years between them.\"78 And further, \"despite the"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"14 CHAPTER 1 divergences, the teachings of the KM are the direct continuation of those of the LXX Books.\"79 Again, this would mean that there is some degree of unity in the Jabirian corpus, and the differences between various groups of its writings are not great after all. Indeed, I have myself discovered in the present study that certain fundamental alchemical doctrines expressed in Jabir's Ahjdr already exist in an identical contexual setting in the al-Rahma al-Kabir—and this latter is the earliest extant work of the corpus, separated from the former by no less than 300 treatises according to Kraus' own counting. Therefore, ironic as it seems, the final word on this issue is none other than that of Kraus himself: The coherence and unity of thought expressed therein [sc. in the Jabirian corpus] are astonishing.80 As for Kraus' speculative argument that the Jabirian practice of tabdid al-Hlm suggests a plurality of authors, it is interesting that once again he himself provides the grounds for a criticism of his own views. In his learned discussion entitled \"The Principle of Dispersion of Knowledge in Antiquity and the Middle Ages,\"81 Kraus informs us that Jabir's use of this principle is no anamoly in the history of dissemination of ideas: Maimonides practiced it, and so did Roger Bacon. And if that is the case, why do we postulate a collective authorship for the Jabirian works when we don't do the same with the writings of Maimonides and Roger Bacon? A similar remark can be made concerning Kraus' argument which he calls \"conclusive\": could we not imagine that some explanation other than a plurality of authors may legitimately be sought for the Jabirian fluctuations in the classification of natural substances? One is here reminded of Marjorie. Grene who talks of what prima facte appears to be a \"glaring contradiction at the root of Aristotle s thought, 82 but by constructing a fresh perspective she undertakes the challenging and interesting task of making this contradiction vanish. Why should our methodology be otherwise for Jabir? 2. Jabir and the Shi'-i Imam Jafar Jabir's alleged relationship with the sixth ShH Imam Jacfar al-Sadiq (d. 147/765) plays a central role in the traditional accounts of the former's life and times. Our standard sources agree that Jabir was in close rapport with the Imam.83 On the other hand, in the writings of the Jabirian corpus there are numerous occasions when the author claims to INTRODUCTION 15 be his intimate disciple: it is in the first place to this \"Master\" (Sayyid) that Jabir owes the knowledge of the secrets of alchemy, it is under his direct inspiration that Jabir composes his writings, and it is this Ma^dan al-Hikma (Mine of Wisdom)84 who is Jabir's critic and guide par excellence.85 From the point of view of the dating of the Jabirian corpus, an enquiry into the Jabir-Jacfar relationship is obviously of crucial importance. Of the dates of the Imam we have much reliable historical information—if Jabir is his disciple, then we can determine his dates too. Thus it is hardly surprising that, before presenting the constructive part of his thesis, Kraus addresses the question of the link between the two figures. His teacher Julius Ruska had already \"eliminated Jacfar from the history of alchemy,\"86 now Kraus sets out to eliminate him from the story of Jabir. But before examining Kraus' arguments, let us look at some of the significant peculiarities of the manner in which the Imam is mentioned by Jabir: 1. Throughout the Jabirian corpus, there are literally hundreds of references to Jacfar. But in a vast majority of cases, these references take the form of an invocation which consists in the formula \" wa haqqi sayyidT (By My Master . . .). In fact so numerous is this invocation that it practically functions in the texts as the conjunctions \"however,\" \"and so therefore,\" \"thereby,\" \"but,\" and the like. 2. In a very few cases does Jabir add the name Jacfar to this formula.87 And the instances in which he specifies an actual encounter with the Imam are even fewer.88 3. It emerges from an examination of a good number of Jabirian texts89 that all those writings concerning which an actual encounter with the Imam is reported belong to the earlier part of the corpus. To the best of our present knowledge of Jabirian writings, the last such work is the Kitab al-'-Ahd (Book of the Pact) in which the author records a face-to-face conversation with Ja'far.90 Now, in Kraus' census in which the works are enumerated in a chronological sequence, the cAhdoccupies the numbers 1053-10^5.91 The last count in the census, as we have noted, is 2982. This means that when the text in question was written, only about 35% of the Jabirian corpus had been constitued.92 4. Although the invocation \"By My Master . . .\" is found in the latter part of the corpus too, there are no indications in these subsequent"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"16 CHAPTER 1 references that Jacfar is alive at the time when the writing of these text is actually carried out. In fact, references to Jacfar in the Kitab al-Khawass al-Kabir (Great Book of Properties, Kr 1900-1950), which is a later work, make it quite evident that the Imam has now died: (a) In the \"Sixteenth Discourse\" of the al-Khawass, Jabir relates a conversation with the Master (without naming him). But this report, which has been inserted totally out of context,93 concerns a conversation about an earlier work, the Kitab al-Hasilp4 to be sure, the topic of this conversation is not the work in which the encounter is being reported, (b) Talking about Jacfar in the \"Seventeenth Discourse,\" Jabir says: \"My Master often used to say (laqad kana Sayyidi yaqiilu li kathirati),95 Note the use of the past continuous tense, (c) In the \"Sixth Discourse\" we find mentioned two Jacfars— the Imam Jacfar al-Sadiq and the familiar Abbasid vizier Jacfar ibn Yahya al-Barmakl.96 The latter Jacfar—appearing in the work as a young child—-was born in c. 150/767, two years after the death of the Imam. Obviously it would be absurd to assume that the author was trying to give the impression that both Jacfars were alive at the same time—given the religious importance of the Imam, and the fact that his dates have always been rather well-known, nobody could get away with such miscalculation. In fact, the opening sentences of this \"Discourse\" clearly imply that it had been some time since Jabir was in the service of the Imam: \"One day,\" writes Jabir, \"when my renown as a learned man and true disciple of my Master had become known. . . .\"97 The author is talking about a time when his reputation had been established among the wider public, and this implies a passage of time. 5. Another possible evidence is to be found in the Cairo manuscript of the al-Khawass (Tabi'iyyat, 621). In the \"Sixth Discourse\" where the Imam is actually named, the manuscript adds the formula \"radiya Allahu canhu' (may God be pleased with him!) after \"Sayyidi Jacfar\" (my Master Jacfar).98 Indeed, one cannot overrule the possibility that this standard prayer, which is always offered for the dead, is a spurious addition made by the scribe.99 But at the same time one notes the absence of the formula from the manuscripts of earlier Jabirian writings.100 Kraus finds no credibility in Jabir's story. He dismisses it first on rational grounds: (i) \"According to the calculations of Holmyard,\" he recalls, \"Jabir was born at the beginning of 2nd century Hijra and died INTRODUCTION 17 toward 200H.101 When Jacfar died (about 147H) he [sc. Jabir] could scarcely have been more than 35.\" But since references to the Imam are found throughout the corpus, \"it is necessary to assume that all writings [of Jabir] were composed before the death ofJ ajar, that is to say, in their author's youth.\"102 (ii) The Jabir-Jacfar relationship \"furthermore implies a chronological misinterpretation.\" For if we assumed that the earlier parts of the Jabirian corpus were composed during the lifetime of Jacfar, and the latter after his death, then \"how can it be explained that already the first collection [of the corpus], the CXII Books, contains treatises dedicated to the Barmecides whose coming to power took place in 170/786 [that is, some 21 years after Jacfar's death], and particularly a treatise dedicated to Jacfar ibn Yahya al-Barmakl born around 150/767?\"103 Clearly, by virtue of the foregoing discussion, it is not at all difficult to refute the first argument of Kraus. A closer examination of the manner in which Jabir refers to. the Imam suggests that it is only necessary to admit that some 35% of the Jabirian writings, not all of them, had been completed during Jacfar's lifetime. And now that we have redrawn the picture of the size of the corpus, there is nothing fantastic in the assumption that by the age of 35 Jabir had accomplished this much. As for argument ii, it stands on seriously problematic foundations. It is a consistent feature of the Jabirian corpus that each treatise mentions, and is mentioned by, numerous others. There is hardly an exception, for this is the only way the principle of tabdid al-'ilm could work. In fact so copious and so frequent are these intra-corpus bibliographic notices that Kraus calls them \"bothersome.\"104 And it is also thanks to these mutual references that Kraus was able to establish the relative chronological order of these writings. Now, there is something remarkably anamolous about the three treatises which reportedly belong to the first collection in the corpus, the CXII Books, and are, Kraus tells us, dedicated to the specific members of the Barmecide family. These works leave no trace anywhere in the entire corpus—in no other works are they referred to, and no manuscripts of them have been found. And more, they are mentioned nowhere in the external tradition, and the only source stating their existence is Ibn al-Nadlm.105 Also, there is something highly suspicious about them: two of them are dedicated to figures totally unknown to historians—cAll ibn Ishaq al-Barmakl and Mansur ibn Ahmad al-Barmakl (?).106"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"18 CHAPTER 1 But in Kraus' catalogue of the CXII, two additional texts appear as dedications to the Barmecides in general. These titles, which Kraus has taken from Ibn al-Nadim's Fihrist, read \"Kitab Ustuquss al-Uss al-Awwal ila^l-Baramika (The First Book of the Element of Foundation Dedicated to the Barmecides) and \"Kitab Ustuquss al-Uss al-Thdni ilayhim (The Second Book of the Element of Foundation Dedicated to Them). In 1928 Holmyard published these texts from a Bombay lithograph edition of 1891,107 and subsequently in 1979 Peter Zirnis made them the subject of a critical edition.108 It is most significant that neither Holmyard's text, nor any of the additional manuscripts studied by Zirnis (MS Paris 5099, f. 194a - f. 194a, and Ms Berlin Or. Add. Oct. 2250), make any mention of the Barmecides. The first title reads \"Kitab Ustuquss al-Uss '•aid Ray al-Faldsifa li Jabir ibn Hayyan wa huwa^l-Awwal min al-Thaldtha' (The Book of the Element of Foundation According to the Opinion of the Philosophers by Jabir ibn Hayyan. This is the First of the Three);109 there are no references to the Persian family in the second title either, which appears as \"Kit. Ust. al-Uss caid Ray al-Diydna wa huwa al-Thdni li Jabir\" (The Book of Elem. Found. According to Religious Opinion. This is the Second by Jabir).110 One notes that Sezgin too gives the titles of these works without any mention of the Barmecides.111 It is therefore an inescapable conclusion that Ibn al-Nadim's titles are corrupt. Zirnis, then, had ample justification for his explicit declaration that \"they [sc. these tides] are incorrectly listed in . . . [the] Fihrist.\"n2 In fact, there is yet another title in the Fihrist of Ibn al-Nadlm presented as the third book of the Ustuquss, immediately following the above two. This reads \"Kitab al-Kamal huwa al-Thalith ilayhim (Book of Perfection. This is the Third Dedicated to Them [sc. Barmecides]).113 Here Kraus himself, after examining the extant manuscripts, drops the reference to the Barmecides. In the manuscripts the title is restricted to \"Kitab al-Kamal\" (Kr 10), and Ibn al-Nadim has evidently made another mistake in reporting that this work is the third part of the Ustuquss,114 We have, then, sufficient grounds to conclude that as far as the first half of the Jabirian corpus is concerned, the alleged mentions of the Persian family are highly suspect and utterly undocumented. It is only in the latter half that the Barmecides are clearly and evidently referred to. This makes good chronological sense and answers Kraus' objections. Kraus' next argument for dismissing the Jabir-Jacfar relationship is of a historical nature, an argument which stems from his inability to find a I INTRODUCTION 19 I mention of Jabir in authentic Shici sources. If Jabir was such an intimate disciple of Jacfar, then he should certainly have been referred to in the bio-bibliographic sources of the sect: \"It is surprising,\" says Kraus, \"that the figure of Jabir leaves no trace in the vast biographic literature of the Shi'i imamate, where conscientious theologians have gathered together the lives of the famous men of their sect. These works ... go to great pains to enumerate all people who approached the Imam Jacfar, even those of the humblest state, or those considered to be the worst heretics and apostates. . . . The imami biographers would scarcely have hesitated to reserve him [sc. Jabir] a place in their works if they had reason to believe in his existence.\"115 What is the evidence of Kraus? We find him citing three works. The Kitab Ma'rifat Akhbar al-Rijdl (Book of the Understanding of Reports Concerning Distinguished People) of al-Kashshi (d. c. 340/951);116 and two later compilations-—Kitab Tanqih al-Maqal fi Ahwdl al-Rijdl (Book of the Reexamination of the Accounts Concerning Distiguished People) tf al-Mamaqani,117 and Muhammad Muhsin's Kitab al-Dhari'a ild Tasanif al-Shi'a (Source Book of ShlcI Writings).118 None of these, it is reported, mentions Jabir. But one wonders if Kraus has not been unusually hasty in making a sweeping generalization on the evidence just of three works. In fact, he may well be aware of the scantiness of his supporting data, since: 1. Kraus had regretted that he could not make use of al-Amin al-cAmili's Ayan al-Shica (Eminent Shici Personalities), a modern encyclopedic work which draws upon, and quotes, numerous classical and mediaeval sources. Speaking highly of this compilation, Kraus had ruefully observed that \"it has not yet reached beyond [the first] letter [of the Arabic alphabet] alif.*\"11.9 However, to the good fortune of a later generation, the A'yan did progress further in the meantime. Now, to be sure, not only is our alchemist mentioned in the encyclopedia, he receives a conspicuously extensive coverage.120 The compiler aI-cAmili quotes, among several others sources, the Shici astrologer cAli ibn Tawus al-Hilli (d. 664/1266) who in his Faraj al-Humum bi Macrifat cIlm al-Nujum (Relief from Anxiety through the Knowledge of Astrology) introduces Jabir as a historical companion of Jacfar al-Sadiq, and as one of those ShlcIs who were knowledgeable in the theory of astrology and skillful in its practice.121 A similar testimony of cAbdAllah al-Yafici (d. 769/1367) is also cited; and this is to be found in Yaficl's Mir^at al-Janan (Mirror of the"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"20 CHAPTER 1 Heart).122 As for the modern author of the encyclopedia, al-cAmili himself, he strongly sides with this opinion.123 2. But perhaps the authorities cited by al-cAmili are too late to be reliable. Is Jabir mentioned in earlier Shlci sources? In fact, he appears in a source that may well be treated as the earliest possible testimony we could imagine not only for Jabir's relationship with Jacfar, but also for his very historicity. One of the first ShicI agents {daci) of the 2nd/8th century, al-Mufaddal ibn cUmar, has left us a small body of reports of Jacfar's aphorisms, a compilation put together in a manner akin to Hadith collection. In this short work, bearing the title al-Hikam al-Jafariyya (Jacfarl Wisdom), the author twice presents Jabir in the company of Jacfar.124 It should be noted that the historical personage al-Mufaddal was a student of the well-known ghali (Shlci extremist), and for a while a companion of Jacfar, Abu3l-Khattab (d. c. 135/755) who appears as the ultimate transmitter (rawi) in the Hikanis chain of authorities (isnad)} 25 The two major heresiographers of Islam, al-Ashcari (d. 324/935) and al-Shahrastani (d. 548/1153), both mention al-Mufaddal and say that after the death of the extremist Abu3l-Khattab, the sect Khattabiyya was named after the the former as Mufaddaliyya.126 The work in question, the Hikam, is found in the Majdlis al-Mu'minln of Nurallah al-Shustari (d. 1019/1610),127 and there seems to be no pressing reason to doubt its authenticity. So we have here a mention of Jabir by a contemporary whose historicity has never been called into question. 3. The famous Shici biographer al-Najashl (d. 450/1058) mentions two brothers al-Husayn and Abu cAtab, sons of Bistam ibn Sabur al-Zayyat, both of whom, he says, wrote a number of works on therapeutic medicine.128 The date of the death of al-Husayn is given in the sources as 401 Hijra (= 1010 A.D.).129 To these two brothers a short work entitled Tibb al-AHmma (Medicine of the Imams) is attributed130—another Hadith type of compilation which reports, with a chain of authority, different medicaments prescribed for a host of ailments by ShicI Imams. And in this work again, we see Jabir figuring: the authors report a letter written by him to Jacfar seeking his benedictions during an illness.131 al-cAmill does refer to this work, and, in addition, to another work by the same pair of authors entitled Rawdat al-Janndt (Gardens of Paradise) which he quotes: \"Abu Musa Jabir ibn Hayyan is among the most famous of the scientists... .\"132 INTRODUCTION 21 4. The rather well-known 5th/11th century Ismaclli compilation, Dastur al-Munajjimin (The Way of the Astrologers) also mentions Jabir, and in a most instructive manner: he is counted among the four \"most famous supporters of Jacfar,\"133 the other three being Abu3I-Khattab, al-Mufaddal ibn cUmar, and the historically important religio-political figure 'AbdAllah ibn Maymun al-Qaddah (d. c. 180/796).134 Kraus is familiar with the Dastur's reference to Jabir, but commits this information to a footnote.135 Indeed, much of what has been said above requires further investigations. But one thing is certain: in saying that the figure of Jabir leaves no trace in classical ShicI sources, Kraus has been too hasty. 3• Religious Trends of the Corpus: Kraus' Late Dating The emergence of the Ismaclll movement from the breast of proto-Shici gnosis is one of the most perplexing episodes of the religious history of Islam, no less shadowy, and no less controversial, than the Jabir-Problem itself.131? What are the origins of the Ismaciliyya? Who was the founder of Ismacilism?137 When and how did the Qarmati branch of the Ismacills come into existence? What kind of literature was being written and circulated among the early leaders of this sect, and who were the authors? There are no clear answers to these questions.138 The period between the death of Jacfar al-Sadiq and the appearance of the Ismaclliyya as a secret revolutionary organization is a time interval sunk in darkness. All we know clearly is this much: after the death of Jacfar a group of his followers clung to the imamate of his eldest son Ismacll who, by the rule of nass,139 had been designated by him as his successor but had predeceased him. Some of them maintained that Ismacil had only receded into occultation and will reappear as the Qa^im or Mahdv, others recognized Ismail's son Muhammad as the Imam. Yet others—who were to be the later Ithnd 1Ashari (the twelver ShlcIs)—first chose Jacfar's eldest surviving son cAbdAllah as his successor; then, upon cAbdAllah's hierless death a few weeks thereafter, proclaimed the imamate of another son Musa al-Kazim. After more than a hundred years, around 264/877, emerged the Isma'ili movement under the leadership of Hamdan Qarmat in Kufa, Khalaf in al-Rayy, and under various leaders elsewhere.140 What happened in the intervening period is a blank spot, and so far historians have been able to fill it but only partially and tentatively: \"Nothing is known about the history of Ismaclli movement developing out of [its] nucleus until after the middle of the 3rd/9th century,\" wrote"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"22 CHAPTER 1 Madelung not so long ago.141 Given that our knowledge concerning the formative phase of the Ismaciliyya is, at best, fragmentary, one feels somewhat surprised that it constitutes the very foundation of the constructive part of Kraus' thesis. But to explain one obscurity in terms of another is not a very promising methodology. In a nutshell, Kraus' reasoning runs as follows: Jabirian writings show Qarmatl-Ismacili tendencies and employ the esoteric vocabulary of this sect.142 This provides a definite clue to the dating of the entire corpus. These writings, the argument proceeds, could not have been composed earlier than 270/883, because it was at this time that the Qarmati appeared on the scene.143 Therefore, given that the internal chronological sequence of the various constituent parts of the corpus had already been established, these writings could now be dated with sufficient accuracy.144 Two questions immediately arise: First, what degree of certainty can we attach to the claim that Jabirian texts do, indeed, display a Qarmati character? And second, does our present knowledge of the origins of the Ismacili movement allow us definitively to declare that the technical vocabulary of the Qarmati religio-political propaganda did not originate and come into usage before the year 270/883? As to the first question, it is interesting that although Kraus insists that the Jabirian corpus displays \"Isma'lli trends,\"145 he himself wavers in his judgments drastically and frequently. Thus, sometimes Jabirian ideas are \"contrary to the official doctrines of the Ismacilis\";146 sometimes, \"he is close to the teachings of the Nusayris,\"147 but, then, he also \"distinguishes himself from them.\"148 There are times when he has the \"tendency to surpass the teachings of Muslim gnostics,\"149 and occasions when he \"compi!e[s the list of heirarchical grades of ShlcI gnosis] from the vocabulary of different sects.\"150 Here we find Jabir expressing the aspirations of the Fatimids who named themselves after the Prophet's daughter Fatima;151 there we see him in the condemned camp of the Ghulat excluding the Prophet's son-in-law cAli from the list of seven Imams, and supporting the imamate of Muhammad ibn al-Hanafiyya, the son of cAli, but not by Fatima!152 This gives a very confused picture of Jabir's religious tendencies. But there are further confusions that Kraus does not point out. For example, take the question of the number of Imams in Jabir's system. In the Kitab Ikhraj ma fiH-Quwwa ila3l-Fiel, he talks about two religious groups which, among others, fixed the number of Imams to seven,153 I NTRODUCTION 23 \\ but—contrary to what Kraus says154—Jabir does not approve of it; rather, he forbids the reader to share such views.155 In the Kitab al-Khamsin (Fifty Books, Kr 1835-1874), Jabir has six Imams.156 But again, in the Kitab al-Hajar (Book of the Stone, Kr 553) he refers to seven Imams.157 In his religious orientation, we see: Jabir does not seem to be allied to any one group, nor is he consistent. Kraus sees in Jabir's reference to the seven Imams an Ismacili tendency. But in the Hajar where there is, indeed, a mention of seven Imams, Jabir assigns to each one of them a different function, something that does not seem to be in harmony with the Ismacili doctrines. And the Context in which all this occurs is entirely non-religious: \"He [sc. Zosimus] also mentions seven combinations. One is confronted again with the seven combinations in the agreement between astrologers that seven planets govern the universal course of events, and also in religion there are seven Imams.\"158 This passage is in fact reminiscent of the late lst/7th century Waqifi doctrines of the sevener type whose role in the formation of Ismacili cosmology has been emphasized by Strothman.159 There are yet other elements in the religious ideas of Jabir which place him at a great distance, both in substance and in time, from the IsmacIliyya. For example, he often talks about cycles of metempsychosis (takrtr),160 and this seems to have come directly from the teachings of the ghali leader Abu'l-Khattab whose followers had believed in reincarnation and even in the transmigration of the human soul into sub-human bodies.161 Similarly, the gnostic symbolism of the three letters Mim, cAyn and Sin, Jabir's subject matter in the Kitab al-Majid (Book of the Glorious, Kr 706),162 had crystallized in the pre-Ismacili ghali groups of the 2nd/8th century.163 Let us now look at the second question, namely the question concerning the technical vocabulary of the Qarmatl-Ismacilis. It has been some time since Massignon had said that \"an examination of the Karmatian technical terms shows that this doctrine was formed before the end of the second century A.H. [8th century A.D.] in the Imami circles of Kufa.\" And further, \"the first clearly Karmatian author is Abu3l-Khattab. ... In cosmogony he replaced the use of letters ... by their corresponding numerical values. . . . After him Abu Shakir Maimun al-Kaddih164 . . . gave definite dogmatic form to the Karmatian doctrine of emanation.\"165 Kraus is familiar with these observations of Massignon but dismisses them by his remark that \"whatever the origins of the name of the Qarmatis, it is certain that they appeared on the scene around"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"24 CHAPTER 1 270/885.\"166 It should be noted, however, that the views expressed by Massignon have been challenged by others too, and that we are dealing here with a highly controversial issue which has been approached by recent scholars from a number, of different angles.167 An active parti-cipation in this controversy, or even a critical survey of different views, is obviously outside the narrow confines of the present work; therefore, I content myself with a cursory remark that follows. In recent scholarship, perhaps the most extensive and rigorous studies of proto-Ismacilism are due to the historian Wilfred Madelung. Many of Madelung's findings, one notes, seem to support the conclusions of Massignon with the strength of fresh evidence. For example, in an article published in 1961,168 Madelung points out the importance of al-Qasim ibn Ibrahim al-Rassi (d. 246/860) for the understanding of the early history of the Ismaclliyya. In his al-Radd caid Rawafid (Refutation of the Rafidis), the Zaidi Imam al-Rassi gives much valuable information concerning the relationship of many 2nd/8th century groups with the Ismacilis.169 A work actually written in the 2nd/8th century, the Kitab al-Rushd waH-Hidaya (Book of Rectitude and Guidance), is also referred to by Madelung.170 This book seems to have played an important role in the formation of early Ismacili terminology. Later, in a work entitled \"Bemerkungen zur imamatischen Firaq-Literatur\"171 Madelung examined \"the relationship of the books on Shl'ite sects by al-Nawbakhti (d. c. 310/922) and Sacd ibn cAbd Allah al Qummi (d. 301/914), suggesting that their source for the early [sectarian] developments is the lost Kitab Ikhtilaf al-Nas fi^l-Imama (Book of Controversy over the Question of Imamate) of Hisham ibn al-Hakam (d. 179/795-6).\"172 All this indicates an earlier dating for the formation of the doctrines of the Ismaciliyya and their esoteric vocabulary than that which is suggested by Kraus. It seems quite clear, anyway, that Kraus did not have sufficient evidence available to him to claim that the appearance of Qarmati terminology in Jabirian writings proves that they were not composed before the latter years of the 3rd/9th century. We still know very little about the 2nd/8th century, but recent researches seem progressively to weaken the position of Kraus. 4. Citation of Greek Works in the Corpus It has been pointed out above that a number of genuine as well as apocryphal Greek works are found cited in the Jabirian corpus. And this INTRODUCTION 25 t provides Kraus with further evidence for a late dating of these writings. \"If the Jabirian writings are authentic,\" he argues, \"then the Arabic translations of the works of Aristotle, of Alexander of Aphrodisias, of Galen, of ps-Plutarch, must have been carried out more than a century before the date admitted by all. Thus it would no longer be Khwarizmi who introduced the Indian [techniques of numerical] calculation, nor the school of Hunayn which definitively fixed the scientific terminology in the Arabic language.\"173 But against this conservative view, we already have the strong dissenting voice of Fuat Sezgin. \"We should free ourselves,\" Sezgin charges us, \"from the earlier illusion that the time of translations of Greek works into Arabic began only in the 3rd/9th century.\"174 Sezgin's generalizations notwithstanding, his opinion in the specific case of Jabir seems to be correct. Indeed, when the Jabirian quotations of Greek works are actually compared with their 3rd/9th-century Arabic translations, the alchemist turns out to be independent of the latter. What is more critical, we often find archaic terminology in Jabir's citations, as well as striking inconsistencies in the translation of a given Greek term; we also see Greek passages rendered into Arabic without the use of technical language—all this may legitimately be taken to point to an early date. It should be noted that although Jabir refers to his Greek predecessors throughout his corpus, in a vast majority of instances he either paraphrases their writings, or simply expounds their doctrines in his own words. Direct quotations from Greek works, or translations of Greek titles, these are relatively rare. Thus a comparison of Jabir's citations with standard Arabic versions is not easily carried out. But, obviously, an argument for a late dating of the corpus which is based on Jabir's indirect citations of Greek authors cannot be a strong one. Is this what Kraus did? To be sure, the question does arise, since an examinantion of Jabir's direct Greek quotations, rare though they are, would once again render Kraus' position problematic. But I must now turn to the evidence, beginning with my own textual discovery: 1. This is my discovery in Jabir's Ahjar of a hitherto unknown trans-lation of Aristotle's Categoriae, 8, 8b25-lla37—that is, a translation of Aristotle's discourse on quality.175 This Arabic rendering of the Greek text appears in the third part of the Ahjar, a work that has never been published or studied before; therefore, it is hardly surprising that no modern scholar, including Kraus, seems to have identified it."},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"26 CHAPTER 1 Indeed, in terms of its structure, language and terminology, the Jabirian rendering of the Categoriae has nothing in common with what has so far been accepted as the earliest Arabic translation of this work of Aristotle—namely the translation of Ishaq ibn Hunayn (d. 299/911). But the decisive feature of the discovered text is not its independence; rather it is its archaic nature. I have presented in Chapter 5 a critical edition of this entire text; in Chapter 6 it has been translated, analyzed, and compared both with the text of Aristotle and the translation of Ishaq. It will be seen that any suggestion to the effect that Jabir's Categoriae postdates the Hunayn school flies in the face of overwhelming evidence to the contrary. 2. In Jabir's Kitab al-Qadim (Book of the Eternal, Kr 981), Aristotle's Physica appears as \"Kitab Sam' al-Kiydri' (MS Paris 5099 f. 172b). Note the archaic chracter of the Arabic title; the term kiyan is an Arabicization of the Syriac k'yand (= Gr. phusis), a term which had already been abandoned by the time the Huanyn school emerged, having being replaced by the word \"tabi'a\" derived from an Arabic root.176 Thus, we have here an unmistakable evidence that Jabir's translation is older. In fact, the use of the term in question is described by Peters in his Aristoteles Arabus as the \"telltale\" sign—that is, a sign openly betraying the pre-Hunayn origin of a text.177 But the tide changes in a later treatise. In the Kitab al-Bahth (Book of Research, Kr 1800) it becomes the standard \"Kitab al-Sama' al-Tabi'i\" (MS Jarallah 1721, f. 15a) of Ishaq ibn Hunayn. But despite this identity of titles, Jabir's text shows no dependence on that of Ishaq, for 3. In the Bahth (f. 92a) there also appears an actual quotation from Aristode: ft iiiM Jobs' j• 111 ... OLjlaJ jj\\^oj^i o^ Lfp ' Lots He [sc. Aristotle] goes so far as to say in the beginning of the first chapter (mimar) of his Physica that form is prior to all else. It is by virtue of form that there exists in a thing its nature, its essence and its ma'-nd. There is no such passage at the beginning of the Physica in the translation of Ishaq ibn Hunayn,178 nor do we find at the place INTRODUCTION 27 i referred to by Jabir any mention of form in the standard critical editions of the Greek text. And once again, we read an archaic term, mimar (chapter) which, like kiyan, happens to be of Syriac origin.179 This stands in contrast to the later Arabic term \"maqala\" of the Hunayn school. But in the passage quoted, we also see a specific use of the term ma'na. Note that ma'na has here been placed in opposition to dhat (essence), and, in the context, one would naturally consider it to mean the totality of secondary properties, or accidents, of a physical body, as opposed to its essential or primary properties. And this particular technical sense of ma'-nd seems to betray affinities with the cosmological speculations of early kaldm.18° To be sure, the term in question is found to be used everywhere in the philosophical and scientific literature of Islam,181 but, as a first observation, one notes that Jabir is here employing it to denote a concept which it denoted in the writings of the mutakallimun (sing, mutakallim, practitioner of kaldm) of the late 2nd/8th and early 3rd/9th centuries.182 Indeed, we find ma'na being feverishly and widely discussed in the kaldm literature of this period, with al-Ashcari in his Maqalat tracing it all the way back to the 2nd/8th century figure Hisham ibn al-Hakam.183 The mutakallim Ibrahim al-Nazzam (d. 221/836) wrote a whole work on ma'na, entitled Kitab al-Ma'na 'ala Mu'ammar (Book of Ma'na Against Mu'ammar),184 and this Mu'ammar (d. 215/830) is another early mutakallim whose doctrine of ma'na has been expounded by al-Khayyat (d. after 300/910) in his Kitab al-Intisar,185 Given this climate, it does not seem surprising to find a kaldm concept finding its way into the works of Jabir, and this is yet another indication that he was drawing upon traditions which antedate the Bayt al-Hikma.186 In the same Jabirian work, the Bahth (f. 47a), we have another quotation from the eight chapter of Physica (250bl 1-15). When this quotation is compared with Ishaq's translation, one does find a correspondence, but no dependence. The two versions are totally dissimilar not only in terminology, but also in style and structure, with the version of Ishaq showing a much higher degree of sophistication. The left and right columns below give, respectively, Jabir's text and that of Ishaq:187"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"28 CHAPTER 1 ^u_ji ^ tjUS\"^ _rwJi yi JUL* |J jl jju cjLT jI |J IS*ji-1 cJl5* JU-I uLf jl CJlf jl LfjJ-*J jrfjj J>j jl 1+^.j ^ JUi l+J j.^SJI oil \\+J L.Ij U I4JI Jlli Vjl Ul .

Turning now to the works of Galen, we note that the title of his De compositione medicamentorum secundum locos appears in Jabir as \"Kitab al-Mayamir\"(Book of Chapters; \"maydmir\" is the plural of the abandoned term \"mimar\").ls8 Against this, we have the literal rendering of Hunayn ibn Ishaq which reads Kitab al-Adwiya bi-hasab al-Mawadic al-'-Alima,189 Evidently, the Jabirian translation is older. 6. Galen's De elementis secundum Hippocratem is cited by Jabir under the title \"Kitab al-cAndsir,,,^e><) as opposed to Hunayn's Kitab fi^l-Ustuqsat cald Ray Buqrdt,191 7. In another title there is a slight difference. In Jabir we find Galen's De propriis placitis referred to as \"ma I'taqadahu Rayari'^2 in Hunayn it is fi ma YaHaqiduhu Rayan.193 8. As for the actual citations of Galen's texts, they are not being examined here. But we ought to acknowledge that this matter has already been investigated by Sezgin who testifies that Jabir's quotations do wo# generally agree with the translations preserved.194 Pending further research, this testimony must prevail. 9. The legendary account of Archimedes' discovery of the hydrostatic balance is given in detail in Jabir's Bahth (f. 131b - f. 132b). Kraus quotes this entire passage, but remains completely silent as to the source which may have been available to the author.195 It should be noted that the comprehensive work on physical balances by al-Khazini (composed c. 514/1120) does contain the legend,196 but, in terminology and in matters of detail, it is totally dissimilar to the text of Jabir. For example, the term used for crown is \" tdf in Jabir, \" ikliP in Khazini, the king fn question is Maliqiyadus (Domitian?) in the former, Hiero in the latter, and so on.197 Obviously the two texts draw upon different sources. But this whole question needs further investigation. I INTRODUCTION 29 I The evidence just presented is neither exhaustive nor foolproof,198 but it seems sufficient to point to the problematic nature of Kraus' position. 5. The Sirr of Balinas: Kraus' Search for a terminus post quem One work which has influenced in a fundamental way the cosmological and alchemical doctrines of Jabir is the well known Kitab Sirr al-Khaliqa wa San'at al-Iabi'a (Book of the Secret of Creation and the Art of Nature) falsely attributed to Apollonius of Tyana (in Arabic, Balinas, Balinus, Balinius, etc.).199 Also known as the Kitab al-'Ilal (Book of Causes), this text has exercised scholars for nearly two centuries.200 While the Sirr still continues to puzzle historians, certain facts about it have been conclusively established by Ruska,201 Plessner,202 and, above all, Kraus himself:203 (i) The Sirr shares with the Syriac Book ofTreasures (Ar. Kitab al-Dhakha Jir) of Job ofEdessa (Ayyub al-RuhawI, d. 220/835) aproblemataphysica source; (ii) its longer version (and this is the version used by Kraus) includes extracts from the book De natura hominis (Ar. Kitab ft Tabi'at al-Insdn) ofNemesius of Emesa (composed c. 400 A.D.); (iii) it shares some material with the Arabic Hermetic treatise Istimdtis; 204 and (iv) it contains the first occurence of the tabula smaragdina (Ar. al-lawh al-zumurrud) which is also found in the Secretum secretorum (Ar. Sirr al-Asraf) of ps-Aristotle.205 When was the Sirr written? In his pursuit of this recalcitrant question, Kraus carried out an incisive study of Jabir's debt to the ps-Apollonius literature, finally bringing to light a passage in a writing of the Ismaclll agent Abu Hatim al-Razi (d. 322/933) wherein, he confidently felt, lay the answer.206 In his Kitab A'lam al-Nubuwwa (Book of the Signs of Prophethood), Kraus announced, Abu Hatim reports a debate between himself and the alchemist Abu Bakr ibn Zakariyya al-Razi during which the former is asked about the author of the Sirr. According to the report, Abu Hatim replied that the text was apocryphal, written only during the time of the Abbasid Caliph al-Ma'mun (198/813 to 218/833).207 Kraus thought that this dating was acceptable because other indications were apt to confirm it.208 Now he had found a terminus post quem for the Jabirian corpus. Once again, one obscure issue is being explained by another which happens to be just as obscure. To date the Sirr we first have to date (i) the Arabic translation of Nemesius' De natura hominis, and (ii) the compilation of the Hermetic treatise Istimdtis. But neither task has been accomplished. Concerning the first task, one notes that the standard"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"30 CHAPTER 1 translation of Ishaq ibn Hunayn could not have been available at the time of al-Ma^mun since the translator was two years old when the Caliph died. Besides, a comparison of the text of the De nat. hom., as it appears in the Sirr, with that of Ishaq's translation shows the archaic nature of the former's terminology and style.209 This means that we have to presuppose an earlier translation—none has so far been discovered. But more serious is the problem concerning the second task: Istimatis still remains undated.210 A significant progress toward the dating of the Sirr has recently been made by Ursula Weisser who has made available to us for the first time a critical edition of the text.211 An important discovery of Weisser is that there exist two extant versions of the Sirr: a short version, which she calls A, and a longer version, styled B. Weisser believes that A was translated from a Greek original in the 2nd/8th century, and it antedates B. Now, Kraus had access only to the longer version B, and the text which Abu Hatim refers to is also, in Weisser's view, the same version B.212 Weisser's conclusions have not gone unchallenged.213 But since the publication of her work, one fact has been established: the dating of the Sirr suggested by Kraus is seriously problematic, and his late dating of the Jabirian corpus based on that of the former is equally problematic. THE PRESENT WORK: METHODOLOGICAL INDIFFERENCE As early as 1929, Julius Ruska had proudly made a resounding declaration. \"After so many errors, oscillations and reverses,\" he wrote, \"the Arabic Jabir-Problem has' [at last] been brought to a satisfactory solution.\"214 It noSv seems that Ruska's sense of triumph was much too premature. Even the monumental work of Kraus turns out to be a humbling exercise; for it only throws into sharp relief the fact that we know so little about the contents of the Jabirian texts on the one hand, and about the 2nd/8th century religious and intellectual history of Islam on the other, that any solution proposed at this stage is bound to remain highly precarious. Kraus' thesis, I shall submit, cannot be taken to be faultless and critically established. His work is a milestone, but not the destination; he helps us formulate our questions, but does not provide incontrovertible answers. Indeed, our preliminary criticism of Kraus forces upon us the moral that it is a better strategy for the moment to place in abeyance the INTRODUCTION 31 question of the authorship and dating of the corpus, and to invest our energies, rather, into critical studies of Jabir's writings themselves. And, at the same time, to investigate further the scientific, philosophical and religious climate of Islam in the century in which the alchemist allegedly lived.215 About the texts of the Jabirian works our knowledge is painfully lacking. There exist literally hundreds of manuscripts of these writings in various libraries of the world lying unread and unstudied. To be sure, this is a lacuna not only in the Arabic Jabir-Problem, but also in the Latin Geber issue, a handicap both for the Latinist as much as it is for the Arabist: we now accept that Geber is not to be identified with his Arab namesake, but we also know that the ideas of the author of the Geberian texts were not altogether indepedent of Arabic alchemists, and these ideas display also a dependence on Jabir.216 What is the nature of this dependence? And how was Jabir appropriated in the Latin West? We know too little about Jabirian texts to answer these questions satisfactorily. In fact, even those works of Jabir which are known to, or strongly suspected to, exist in mediaeval Latin translations largely lie unexamined.217 Our deficient knowledge of Jabirian writings introduces gaps in our understanding of Geber, and ultimately, of the Chemical Revolution. The pages that follow constitute a modest step toward supplying this deficiency. But the question of the authorship and dating of the Jabirian corpus is neither trivial nor irrelavant. It is non-trivial because to take a position on this question is to take a methodological position, a position that governs in most fundamental ways the historian's very approach to Jabirian writings. And, to be sure, a position must be taken since one cannot study these writings in the emptiness of a historical vacuum— hence the relevance of the vexed question. But what is Jabir's historical milieu? Given that this issue remains unresolved, the present work takes what may be called a position of methodological indifference. In carrying out a critical study of one the most important and difficult treatises of the entire Jabirian corpus, the primary aim of the work is to understand Jabir in his own terms. That is, to identify certain fundamental notions of his system, and, then, to examine how these notions operate within the internal perspective of his scientific and philosophical doctrines. But to make sense of Jabir's ideas, and to reconstruct their historical and conceptual framewok, the present work seeks its illumination essentially from those doctrines and writings which"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"32 CHAPTER 1 are known to have come into existence by the 2nd/8th century, and which could have been, in principle, available to an author of this period in the Islamic Near East. For Kraus, and, indeed, for the vast majority of contemporary scholars, this would constitute only a subset of the sources available to Jabir; for Sezgin and Holmyard, this is the entire set. But such an approach impinges upon the views of neither school, and a methodological indifference is thereby maintained. This indifference also functions as a protective device. For even if—to consider the extreme case—every bit of my criticism of Kraus is dismissed by scholars, such dismissal cannot by itself provide grounds for discarding the main body of this work. Should such eventuality befall me, all I shall need to do is ask the reader to skip this introduction. INTRODUCTION 33 NOTES 1 In the Jabirian treatises which have either been published or read by me in manuscripts, as well as in the traditional biographies, the patronymic part of the author's name (kunya) appears frequently as Abu Musa, but sometimes also as Abu cAbdAllah. Often attached to it is the epithet al-Sufi, the tribal name (nisba) al-Azdi and names indicating Jabir's place of origin al-Kufi or al-Tusi. Ibn Khallikan (d. 681/1282) reports in his Biographical Dictionary that Jabir was from Tarsus (see de Slane tr. [ 1842-71], I, p. 300) and this is confirmed by another standard source, the Kashf al-Zunun of Hajji Khalifa (d. 1069/1658). However, this latter biographer—according to whom Jabir died in 160/777— calls him al-Tarsust at one place, but at another place says that Jabir was from Tarsus and is called al-Tusi (!) (see Fliigel ed. [1835-1858], p. 34 and p. 79). Ibn al-Nadim, who in naming Jabir wavers between both kunyas, Abu Musa and Abu 'AbdAllah, mentions the belief that Jabir was originally from Khurasan (see Fliigel ed. [1871], pp. 354-358). For a discussion of this last account see below. 2 This coinage seems to be due to J. Ruska writing in the 1920's and later. The \"Jabir-Problem\" essentially consisted in a positive identification of the author(s) of the texts attributed to Jabir. 3 It is somewhat ironic that this powerful work of Kraus (Kraus [1942-3]) has been followed by a period of relative indifference. The past fifty years have seen only one edition of what is no more than a tiny proportion of a vast corpus, namely the one-volume Lory ed. [1988] which contains 14 small Jabirian texts, 10 of which were translated into French in the earlier Lory tr. [1983]. No English translation of any Jabirian text has been published since Kraus, but we have in addition a handful of two texts rendered into German, and one into French (Siggel tr. [1958], Rex tr. [1975], and Corbin tr. [1950] respectively). Zirnis' edition and English translation of another text (Zirnis ed. and tr. [1979]) never appeared in print. See \"Modern Editions and Translations of Jabirian Texts\" in the appendices below. 4 The Ta'aliq is quoted by Abu Hayyan al-Tawhldl (see al-Shabibi [1923], p. 7). 5 In his commentary on the Risala of Ibn Zaydun, Kitab Sarh al-'-Uyun fi Sharh Risdlat Ibn Zaydun (Ibrahim ed. [1383/1964]). Jabir is mentioned in the work being commented upon. Cf. Kitab al-Ghayth atrMujsam of Khalil al-Safadi (d. 764/1363), Cairo ed. [1305/1887], p. 242. 6 See Arabic text in Fliigel ed. [1871], 355:11-21. 7 Ibid., 355:18. 8 On the question of the authenticity of his writings, see Levey [1966]."},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"34 CHAPTER 1 9 MS Leiden 1267 f. 15; f. 26. 10 Tr. Levey [1966], p. 22. 11 According to Ibn al-Nadim, al-Razi used to quote, \"our Master Jabir ibn Hayyan said\" (Fliigel ed. [1871], 355:20). Indeed, in one manuscript of the Kitab al-Asrar of RazI, Jabir is referred to as \"our Master\" (Stapleton, Azo and Husain [1927], p. 385). Kraus in his [1942-3] has discussed the relationship between the two alchemists (II, pp. LX-LXII), but as opposed to the picture he draws, one notes that the evidence of Stapleton, Azo and Husain points to a much wider influence of Jabir on Razi, and a much more extensive knowledge of the former on the part of the latter {op. cit., pp. 335-340). 12 See his Rutbat al-Hakim, MS Cairo, Tabi'iyydt 12, f. 198. It is generally believed that this work was written by one of his pupils, therefore we have to place it somewhat later. Cf. Holmyard [1924]. 13 Ibn Umayl in his Kitab Ma3 al-Waraqi refers to two Jabirian treatises belonging to the Kutub al-Mi^a wa^l-Ithna 'As bar a (CXII Books, Kr 6-122), namely the Kitab al-Kbalis (Book of the Pure, Kr 48) and Kitab al-Mujarraddt (Book of Abstractions, Kr 63-64). Ibn Umayl's text has been edited by Stapleton, cAli and Husain in their [1933] (see p. 93 and p. 97). 14 Holmyard [1927] had brought to light a passage from the Kitab al-Akhbar al-Tiwal of Abu Hanifa al-Dlnawari (d. c. 282/895) where a Shici druggist {'•attar) by the name of Hayyan is mentioned. According to al-Dinawarl, this Hayyan al-cAttar was intensely active as a secret Shici agent (da't) working for the Abbasid cause in Khurasan. He also knew Yaqtin to whose son cAll, Jabir has dedicated a book and a poem (Kr H I and Kr 1143). al-Dlnawari reports that in 107/725 Hayyan was put to death with other ShlcI agents by the Umayyad governor of Khurasan (see Guirgass' edition of the Akhbdr in Abu Hanifa al-Dlnawari [1888], pp. 334-337.- Hayyan appears as a ShicI agent also in Tabari, see De Goeje et al. ed.' [18?9?-i901], II, p. 1488). In this man Holmyard recognized the father of Jabir, the date of whose execution provided him the terminus ad quem for the son's date of birth. 15 Maqdisl's testimony exists in his Kitab Bad3 wa^l-Ta^rikb (composed c. 355/ 966). See Huart ed. [1899-1919], II, p. 236. 16 Tabaqat al-Umam, Cheikho ed. [1912], p. 61. 17 Schmieder [1832] and Hoefer [1842-3] are probably the last historians who identified Geber with Jabir. Cf. Newman [1991]. 18 Russell [1678]. 19 In the 1842 Danzig edition of the Summa perfectionis. 20 MS Bodleian, Western 19039» entitled Liber practicus Geberis . . . de investigationeperfecta magisterii. See Holmyard [1925]. INTRODUCTION .35 21 Liber quiflos naturarum vocatur, 1473. This is reported in Holmyard [1925]. 22 Kopp [1869]. 23 Kraus [Plessner] s.v. \"Djabir ibn Hayyan\" [EI^], II, p. 358. 24 Jabir talks about the possibility of an artificial language in the Kitab al-Abjdr. See below (Chapter 3; Edited Text, 19:12-15). 25 For example, in the Kitab al-Hajar (Book of the Stone, Kr 553), Holmyard ed. [1928], 19:12; cf. ibid. 18:4, 23:2. 26 Mujarradat, MS Jarullah 1641, f. 248b, etc. Democritus is also one of those philosophers to each of whom Jabir devotes a separate musahhabat (Emendations) treatise. Thus, Kitab Musahhabat Dhimaqrdtis (Book of Emendations of Democritus, Kr 210). 27 For example, in the Hajar, Holmyard ed. [1928], 18:17; Kitab Ustuquss al-Uss, idem, 90:10; etc. 28 Referred to, for example, in the Kitab al-Qardr (Book of Stability, Kr 172). See Kraus [1942-3], II, p. 44, n. 4. 29 Socrates is held in high esteem by Jabir: In the Kitab al-Tajmi' (Book of Concentration, Kr 398) he is referred to as the \"father of philosophers and their master\" (Kraus ed. [1935] 389:3). We find him mentioned in several works besides meriting a musahhabat treatise (Kr 204). 30 A musahhabat treatise has been devoted to him (Kr 205). While Plato is mentioned elsewhere too, it seems that Jabir does not know any of his genuine works. The Timaeus he quotes in the musahhabat has little in common with the text as we know it. (See Sezgin [GAS], IV, 161 ff.). 3' For a detailed discussion of the Jabirian references to Aristotle, see below. Jabir has written a musahhabat work for him too. 32 In the later work, the Kitab al-Babtb (Book of the Research, Kr 1800), MS Jarallah 1721, f. 11a. 33 Ibid., f. 48a. 34 In the Kitab al-Sirr al-Maknun (Book of the Hidden Secret, Kr 389-391), MS Paris 5099, f. 46b-f. 56b. 35 In the Tajmi', Kraus ed.

In the corpus we have a Jabirian commentary on Euclid, entitled Kitab Sharh Uqlidis (Kr2813), but this is not extant. The book dedicated to Archimedes bears the title Sharh Kitab Wazn al-Taj li Arshamidis (Commentary on the Book of the Weight of the Crown by Archimedes, Kr 2821); for Jabir's account of the latter, see below. 38 MS Paris 5099, f. 116a- f. 116b; MS Jarullah 1641, f. 117a- f. 119a. Text quoted in Kraus [1942-3]. II, pp. 332-337. 39 In the Hdsil]ibir says: \"I have composed this book and my Master has called it the Book of the Result\" (MS Paris 5099, f. 95b). Again, in the Kitab al-Majid (Book of the Glorious, Kr 706): \"Know that my Master, may God be pleased with him, ordered me to compose these books. He established with regard to them an order of gradation which I am not permitted to violate\" (Kraus ed. [1935] 79:9). Cf. Kraus [1942-3], I, pp. XXV-XXVII. 40 \"By God,\" says Jabir in the Kitab al-Khawass al-Kabir (The Great Book of Properties, Kr 1900-1970), \"my Master disapproved of my having written this book [sc. Hdsil], saying: By God,.0 Jabir, if I did not know that nobody will have access to it without meriting it, ... I would have ordered you to destroy this book. Do you know what you have divulged to the public?\" (Kraus ed. [1935], 311:3-6). Similarly: \"My Master often used to say: Proceed as you wish, O Jabir, and reveal the sciences as you please—as long as only those who are truly worthy of it have access to it\" {ibid, 312:5-6). 41 \"My books are numerous and knowledge is dispersed among them\" {al-Khawass al-Kabir, qu. Kraus [1942-3], I, p. XXVII, n. 1). 42 Kraus observes: \"Often in the middle of a treatise, which no reason of composition can justify, Jabir inserts long bibliographic notices\" {ibid., p. XXV). In the Kitab al-Mizdn al-Saghir (Small Book of Balance, Kr 369), we read: \"First collect my books and read what is in them. It behooves you, O reader, that you join these books together so that through prolonged study the secret of creation and the art of nature is revealed to you\" (Kraus ed. [1935], 442:14-15). 43 According to the Kitab Maydan al-'Aql (Book of the Arena of the Intellect, Kr 362), the student will draw no benefit unless he has first read a great number of other treatises in the corpus (Kraus ed. [1935], 209:3 ff.). Further, the Kitab al-Afadil (Book of the Excellents, Kr 313) should be read after all the others INTRODUCTION 37 i {ibid, 209:9). In the Ahjar one reads (MS Paris 5099, f. 59a): \"How can one accomplish the task without reading the Hudud [Book of Definitions, Kr 328], Reading of this book is different from reading others. While others should be read once a month, the Hudud should be kept before the eyes all the time.\" (It should be noted that there are three additional texts in the Jabirian corpus bearing the title Kitab al- Hudud Kr 181; Kr 780; Kr 2745). 44 For this Jabir himself offers an apology: \"Do not be angry, O my brother, if you find a discourse concerning religion in the middle of a discourse on alchemy without the latter having been completed; or if you find a discourse concerning alchemy after a discourse on religion before the principles of the latter have been fully established\" {Kitab al-Majid MS Paris 5099, f. 67b; text in Kraus ed. [1935], 115:10-13). 45 For example, in the Kitab al-Ghasl (Book of Washing, Kr 183), MS Jarullah 1554, f. 202 (see Kraus [1942-3], II, p. 21; Stapleton, Azo and Husain [1927]). 46 For example, in the Kitab al-Manafic (Book of Utilities, Kr 159), ibid, f. 137 47 For example, in the Ghasl, ibid., f. 202; von Lipmann [1919], I, p. 377 identifies this substance as yellow amber. 48 For example in the al-Khawass al-Kabir, qu. Kraus [1942-3], II, 19, n. 11. A Kitab al-Kharsini (Kr 953) is part of the Kitab al-Ajsad al-Sab'a (Book of the Seven Metals, Kr 947-953). For a discussion of this alloy see Needham [1980], p. 429 ff. 49 Ustuquss al-Uss, Holmyard ed. [1928], 67:16-17. 50 In the Kitab al-Ihata (Book of Comprehension, Kr 139), which belongs to the LXX, Jabir presents a critical survey of the doctrines of different schools of thought concerning the numerical proportion of the four Aristotelian qualities in natural substances. He expresses his preference for ashdb al-taba^i1 (the partisans of the natutres) who, he says, believe that in all things the weights of Fire, Earth, Water and Air exist in the proportion 1 : 4 : 5 : 8, totalling 18 (MS Jarullah 1554, f. 81a). This appears to be inconsistent with his doctrine of the number 17 found in the Kutub al-Mawazin. For an extensive discussion of the latter see below, Chapter 2 ff. 51 One of the many valuable contributions of Kraus is his discovery of the internal relative chronological order of various collection of writings belonging to the Jabirian corpus. Thus, beginning sequentially with the oldest: i) Kitab al-Rahma al-Kabir (The Great Book of Mercy, Kr 5), ii) Kutub al-Mi^a wa^l-Ithna '•Ashara (CXII Books, Kr 6-122), iii) Kitab al-SabHn (LXX Books, Kr 123-192), iv) Kutub al-Mawazin (Books of Balances, Kr 303- 446), v) Kitab al-Khams MP a (500 Books, Kr 447-946)."},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"38 CHAPTER 1 As for other writings, Kraus says that the relative dates of the minor works cannot be determined with much exactitude. The 10 Kutub al-Musahhahdt (Books of Emendations, Kr 203-212; see nn. 25, 28-30 above), as well as most of the collections listed by Ibn al-Nadim, seem to date, in Kraus' view, from the time of the LXX or at least- before the Mawazin. The al-Ajsad al-Sabca follow the 500. Kraus places the Bahth and the al-Khawass al-Kabir after the Mawazin in that order. The Kitab al-Khamsin (50 Books) came after these, etc. See Kraus [1942-3], I, pp. XXXIII-XXXV. 52 Holmyard wrote prolifically on Arabic alchemy in general, and on Jabir in particular. Until the very end, he remained reluctant to accept the views of Kraus which I am about to discuss. In an article published more than a decade after Kraus' [1942-3], Holmyard still defended the historicity of Jabir against Kraus (Holmyard [1955]). In his last writing published in 1957, he bitterly criticized the methodology of the German school to which Kraus belonged, accusing his teacher Julius Ruska of having developed \"an exaggerated and unreasonable scepticism concerning the authorship of any early Arabic alchemical work\" (Holmyard [1957], pp. 65-66). From Fuat Sezgin comes perhaps the most powerful, organized and rigorous offensive against Kraus (Sezgin [GAS], IV, p. 132 ff.). 53 To this French historian of science we owe the publication, for the first time in the history of modern scholarship, of nine Jabirian treatises with their French translations carried out. by Houdas (Berthelot [1893], III). See \"Modern Editions and Translations of Jabirian Texts\" in the appendices below. 54 Kraus [1942-3], I, pp. XXVII-LXV. 55 It is interesting to note that in their extensive studies of ps-Aristotle in the Middle Ages, neither Burnett [1986] nor Zimmermann [1986] makes use of Jabir as a source. 56 Kraus ed. [1935], 57:3-11; cff^ex tr. [1975], p. 41. 57 Siggel tr. [1958], p. 2.,,.' .... , v 58 Plessner [1965]; [1972]. 59 For a glimpse of the importance, persistence and complications of this question see Kraye, Ryan and Schmitt eds. [1986], 60 Plessner [1972], p. 212 (emphasis added). 61 I am referring to Marquet [1988] in which Kraus' positive identification of the authorship of the Jabirian corpus functions as the very foundation of, and justification for, a comparative study of the Rasd^il and the Jabirian texts. This led Marquet to the claim that these texts are quoted in the Rasd'il as well as to the sensational hypothesis that the two bodies of writings have some authors in INTRODUCTION 39 common. But, as I have argued (Haq [1992]), Marquet's conclusions cannot survive a closer examination. 62 Plessner s.v. \"Jabir ibn Hayyan\" [DSB], VII, p. 39. 63 Kraus [1942-3], I, pp. 3-171. 64 Ibid., p. XXXIII. 65 Ibid., p. XLVIII. 66 Ibid., p. 105. 67 Ibid., p. 106. 68 Ibid., pp. 106-107. 69 Ibid., p. 142. 70 This is how the title of this work appears in Sezgin [GAS], IV, pp. 73; 254; 256. Kraus' reading of the title is Kitab al-Jumal al-'Ishrun. 71 This figure is somewhat imprecise because 11 treatises of the 500 Books are lost. But on the basis of the average length of treatises in this collection, the approximation of 120 is unlikely to prove radically inaccurate. 72 It is to the credit of Joseph Needham that he was able to recognize the inflatedness of Kraus' enumeration (Needham [1980], p. 392, note g). 73 Kraus [1942-3], I, p.

The alchemist Jildaki (d. 743/1342) in his Kitab al-Burhdn fi Asrdr cIlm al-Mizdn says: \"It is thanks to Imam Jacfar al-Sadiq that he [sc. Jabir] became Imam himself' (qu.

[1928], there are about 90 occasions when the author invokes the authority of his Master. Yet out of these, only 4 times does Jabir actually specify him by name. 88 To the best of our present knowledge of the corpus, only the following works mention an actual encounter with Ja'far: (i) Kitab al-cAyn (Book of the Essence, Kr 315) (ii) Kitab Ikhraj (iii) Kitab al-Hasil (iv) Kitab Nar al-Hajar (v) Kitab al-Rahma al-Saghir (vi) Kitab al-'Ahd (Book of the Pact, Kr 1053-1055) (vii) Kitab al-Khawass al-Kabir.

Others such as Massignon (s.v. \"Karmatians\" [El'], IV, p. 767ff), Strothman (s.v. \"Sab'iya\" [El'], IV, p. 23ff.), Lewis [1940], Stern op. cit., and Halm [1978] acknowledge some link between various sectarian currents of the 2nd/8th century and the earliest speculations of the Ismaciliyya.

But again, the question of the dating of this translation is not quite setded yet: Sezgin ([GAS], IV, pp. 186-188) still calls into question the belief that Qusata ibn Luqa (d. c. 300/912) was the first to render the Greek text into Arabic; and Sezgin does so despite the learned study of Daiber [1980].

As to the third principle, he says that he has \"not been able to locate it in the well-known Arabo-Latin texts (p. 85, emphasis added). This is a cautious statement, for we have on the other hand the uninvestigated testimony of Holmyard: \"Several of [Berthelot s] conclusions have been proved to be incorrect, notably his statement that Jabir does not admit arsenic as a third constituent of metals' (Holmyard [1924], p. 497, emphasis added). 217 As early as 1922, Holmyard had identified a number of Latin manuscripts as mediaeval renderings of Jabirian treatises (Holmyard [1922]). And these were in addition to the two translations with which modern scholarship is familiar, namely, Liber Misericordiae = Kitab al-Rahma al-Kabir, Darmstaedter ed. [1925], and Liber de septuaginta - LXX Books, Berthelot ed. [1906], But, as the following critical survey will show, over the last 70 years very little attention has been paid to Holmyard's suspicions: i) Kitab al-Mawazin = Liber de ponderibus artis in Borellius [1654], p. 103. This has not been been investigated. ii) Kitab al-Mulk (Book of the Dominion, Kr 1985) = Liber regni of Geber in Borellius, loc. cit. There is a complication concerning this title: Ibn al-Nadim quotes Jabir as saying, \"I composed a book known as the Books of MLK [transliterated without supplying vowels].\" (See text in Fliigel [1871], p. 359). Indeed, there are two Jabirian texts with the same (consonantal) title, •ne was published by Berthelot [1893], III; the other by Holmyard himself, ed. INTRODUCTION 47 [1928], p. 161. In both cases, Holmyard reads MLK as 'mulk' (dominion), whereas Kraus reads the word in the latter case as 'malik' (king). Thus, in Kraus [1942-3], the former, i.e., the Kitab al-Mulk is part of the 500 Books (Kr 454); whereas the latter, i.e., the Kitab al-Malik (Kr 1985) is grouped among those individual treatises of the Jabirian corpus which chronologically come toward the end. Now, since Holmyard does not distinguish between the two titles, it is not clear with which of the two he is identifying the Latin text. This whole matter remains uninvestigated. iii) Kitab al-Mujarradat (Book of Abstractions, Kr 63-64) = Liber Denudatorum quoted in De aluminibus et salibus of ps-al-Razi. This has been verified by Ruska [1935]. iv) Kitab al-Thaldthin Kalima (Book of Thirty Words, Kr 125) = Liber XXX verbis, anonymous, appended to Liber de septuaginta in the British Museum, MS Arundel 164. This is a correct identification, but neither text has been critically studied. Cf. Kraus [1942-3], I, p. 42. v) Kitab Khamsat 'Ashara (Fifteen Books, Kr 137) = Liber XV ascribed to Geber in the Trinity College Cambridge Latin MS 1363 f. 137v - f. 140v. This equivalence has been recognized by Kraus ibid, p. 48, but no further studies have been conducted. vi) Kitab Musahhahat Suqrat, (Book of Emendations of Socrates, Kr 204) = Ad laudem Socratis dixit Geber, Bodleian MS Ashmole 1416, f. 148. Holmyard was somewhat doubtful about this equivalence. The Arabic text is no longer extant, but Jildaki's Nihdyat al-Talab (End of the Search) contains an extract in Cairo MS Tabiciyat 114, f. 47. However, the manuscripts remain uninvestigated. vii) Kitab al-Usul (Book of Roots, Kr 412-413] = Liber radicum. With my assistance, this was actually discovered and verified in 1985 by William Newman (see Newman [1985a])."},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 2 THE DOCTRINAL CONTEXT OF JABIR'S KITAB AL-AHJAR: SUBSTANCE, QUALITIES AND THE SCIENCE OF BALANCE By the time Islam emerged on the world scene, the two towering giants of Greek philosophy, Plato and Aristotle, had been blended into Neoplatonism. In fact the marriage of the two sets of ideas had already been consummated when Porphyry (d. 309 A.D.) made it a philosophical orthodoxy that Plato and Aristotle were in agreement.1 Islam found itself heir to an Aristotle soaked in Neoplatonism both of the pagan Athenian as well as of the Christian Alexandrian kind, and inherited both the debates as well as the commentatorial preoccupations of the two schools.2 In the hands of the Neoplatonists, Aristotle underwent a drastic transformation. Thus, for example, his (prime) matter,3 which he had defined negatively4 as an abstraction that can only be arrived at by thinking away forms,5 became extension (diastema) in Simplicius (wrote after 529 A.D.).6 In John Philoponus (Ar. Yahya al-Nahwi, d. .570's A.D.), it became \"the three dimensional.\"7 This had the anti-Aristotelian effect of making matter, the \"first subject\" (hupokeimenon proton)8 of properties in bodies, concrete and knowable. For Aristotle it was neither concrete nor knowable in itself: matter was known only by analogy.9 Jabir goes one step further. First, despite Aristotle's warnings to the contrary, he confounds matter and substance, thus rendering matter a \"this something\" (tode ft');10 he then makes the four primary Aristotelian qualities (hot, cold, moist and dry) concrete, independent and corporeal entities. For Aristotle, we recall, qualities were forms, and were in themselves no more than logical abstractions.11 However, Jabir here makes a Neoplatonic compromise: his substance, as well as his four qualities, still remained incorporeal in the intelligible world. It was only in the natural world that he endowed them with corporeality. In this way he bridged the gap between Plato and Aristotle much in the Porphyrian spirit. But all these observations must now be examined in detail. 49"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"50 CHAPTER 2 Let us begin with the question of historical evidence supporting this filiation of ideas. To what extent is Jabir familiar with Aristotle and his commentators? As for Aristotle, the evidence is overwhelming and unmistakable: Jabir seems to know almost the entire scope of his writings. Of his familiarity with the Physica (Kitab al-Kiyan/Samac al-Tabi^t) and the Categoriae (Kitab al-Maqulat! al-Qatighuriyas) we already know.12 But Jabir also refers to several other components of the Organon,13 and mentions, quotes, or paraphrases, inter alia, the De coelo et mundo (Kitab al-Sama^ w a 3 l-'-Alam),' 4 the De phaenomenis meteorologicis (Kitab al-Athar al-'Ulwiyya),1 5 the De generatione et corruptione (Kitab al-Kawn wa:l-Fasdd),16 and the Metaphysica (Fi ma Bacd al-Tabt'a).17 He also knows several works of the greatest proponent of Aristotelianism, Alexander of Aphrodisias (fl. c. 205 A.D.),18 besides referring to his commentary on Aristotle's Topica (Tubiqa).19 The independent Aristotelian commentator Themistius (fi late 340's-384/5 A.D.) is known to Jabir too. \"Aristotle says in his Physica that form is the completion and perfection of motion (tamam al-haraka wa kamaluha),\" writes Jabir in the Kitab al-Bahth, \"—this is what Alexander had reported in his Risala (Epistle). The same was reported by Themistius in his commentary on the Physica\"20 The latter's commentary on the Metaphysica is also cited: \"As for Themistius, he censured the philosophers in his Risala on the 'Book A' of the Metaphysica. . .. \"21 Concerning Jabir's direct knowledge of the Neoplatonists, the matter is somewhat problematic. In several works, he refers to Porphyry, and in the Kitab al-Tajmic (Book of Concentration, Kr 398) he quotes this pagan Neoplatonist frequently and extensively.22 But it is not clear if Jabir had access to any of his genuine texts, or if he did, which ones. In the Tajmi\\ a Kitab al-Tawltddt (Book of [Artificial] Generation) of Porphyry is cited,23 but this is very likely a spurious text, although the ideas which Jabir attributes to him could well have been derived from some earlier Porphyrian works such as the Philosophy of Oracles or the Letter to Anebon 24 Porphyry also appears in the Jabirian corpus as an alchemical authority along with such figures as Zosimus, Hermes, Pythagoras, Democritus, Aristotle, etc.2'' In the Kitab al-Sirr al-Maknun (Book of the Hidden Secret, Kr 389-391) Jabir gives an account of the classification of spirits according to several historical personages of the antiquity—Porphyry is among them.26 The same is true of Simplicius, he too is referred to in an alchemical context.27 But as for Simplicius' THE DOCTRINAL CONTEXT 51 arch enemy Philoponus, he is not mentioned by Jabir, nor is Porphyry's teacher Plotinus (generally referred to by the Arab writers as al-Shaykh al-Yunani, d. 260 A.D.). Likewise, the name of Proclus (d. 485 A.D.) is nowhere to be found in the Jabirian corpus. However, from a substantive, philosophical point of view, Jabir's cosmological doctrines betray not only a marked influence of Neoplatonism, but, as we shall see, even a continuity with that mode of thought. For one, the theory of emanation and hypostases,which forms the cornerstone of Neoplatonism, is accepted by Jabir as a given, without any criticism as to its metaphysical justification. Furthermore, there are several historical reasons which suggest that it is more natural to assume that Jabir was familiar with Neoplatonic ideas, than to do otherwise. These ideas had reached the Arabic tradition at an early date, having been received, orally or textually, from the existing Hellenized Syriac intellectual culture.28 In fact, there exists in Arabic a whole series of early fragments ascribed to the founder of Neoplatonism, Plotinus,29 and it so happens that \"the Greek work whose impact was most decisive on Arabic philosophical thought [sc. falsafa\\ \"30 is an apocryphal text derived from this same 'Shaykh.' This is the well-known Theologia Aristotelis (Uthulujiya) whose ultimate substratum is Plotinus' Ertneads iv-vi in Porphyry's arbitrary arrangement. But this work of ps-Aristotle includes also parts of Proclus' Elements of Theology and some metaphysical doctrines of Alexander of Aphrodisias.31 The Theologia has been described as the epitome of Neoplatonism as it strove in Hellenistic times to blend all the elements generated during the period of greater activity;32 and it made an appearance in Islam quite early. The question of the exact dating of the Arabic version of this text is, however, still not quite settled yet,33 but we shall let that pass. For our purposes, we have sufficient evidence to assume at least an indirect knowledge of Neoplatonists on the part of Jabir. SUBSTANCE AND MATTER According to one explication of the notion of substance which Aristode provides in the Categoriae, his substance in the primary and strict sense of the word denotes the being of every concrete, individually existing thing: this table, this tree, Socrates. It is the first and most fundamental mode of being or category essentially distinct from nine others (quality, quantity,"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"52 CHAPTER 2 etc.) all of which express accidental mode of being. \"That which is called substance most strictly, primarily and most of all—is that which is neither said of a subject nor in a subject, e.g. the individual man or the individual horse.\"34 Further, \"every substance seems to signify a certain 'this'. . . ,\"35 The idea is again elaborated in the Metaphysica: \"Substance ... is not predicated of a subject, but everything else is predicated of it.\"36 Thus, Socrates is a substance, this one here, an esse per se. His being an Athenian (quality), his stature (quantity), his being a son of Sophroniscus (relation)—all these are predicated of him, but he is predicated of none of these: these are all esse per aliud, accidents of the substance Socrates.37 But, then, is substance not the ultimate subject of all properties of a body, itself predicated of nothing? Aristotle would answer that it is not quite true to say that substance is predicated of nothing: substance is predicated of a 'this,' for we meaningfully say, 'this is a substance.' Thus substance itself needs a subject, a subject \"made definite\"38 by accepting a form, becoming differentiated and individualized. And this ultimate or first subject (hupokeimenon proton) is matter (huLf).39 Aristotle warns that matter is not to be confused with substance: It has now been stated . . . what substance is: it is not predicated of a subject, but everything else is predicated of it. But we must not merely put it like that, for that is not enough. The statement is not clear and further [sc. on this view] matter becomes substance. . . . By matter I mean that which is not in itself said to be a given anything, nor of a given quantity, nor characterized by any of the other categories that define being. For there is something of which each of these is predicated, and its being is different from that of the predicates. For the rest are predicated of substance, and substance of matter, so that the last thing [sc. matter] is in itself neither a given anything, nor of a given quantity, nor anything else. ... —»—-So for those who think of things from this point of view, it turns out to be matter that is substance (ousia). But this is impossible, for separability and being a 'this' are thought to be special chracteresucs of substance.40 In the same passage just quoted, Aristotle makes it plain that matter ivas only an abstraction and could be reached only by means of a thought experiment: one was to take a body and in one's thought strip away all its sroperties (color, taste, smell, length, breadth, depth, etc.) to reach the lltimate subject underneath. Through this thought experiment, one distinguishes between the sum total of properties making this body what t is, and that which by its properties is made into this thing. The latter is natter, while the former is form. \"Aristotle would insist that the THE DOCTRINAL CONTEXT 53 separation here is separation only in thought. There is no suggestion that the first subject could ever exist without having properties [or, conversely, properties could exist without a subject]. The idea is only that one can think of the first subject without thinking of the properties that it undoubtedly has.\"41 Aristotle's idea of matter proved elusive. When all properties of a body are stripped away, what is left? Plotinus called it a \"mere shadow upon shadow.\"42 Jabir declared it \"nonsense.\"43 Like Descartes' mind, there was no language to talk about matter, except by analogy. And there were internal problems too! Prime matter was imperceptible,44 and it was thought of as a potentiality, having the capacity to receive forms. But this very capacity to receive forms is an inalienable property, so matter could not after all be conceived without at least this property attached to it— but, if this is the case, then matter is no longer unanalyzable.45 Small wonder that Philoponus dispensed with it as something useless and impossible, and replaced it with three dimensional extension.46 So bothersome was the idea of prime matter for Jabir that in the Ahjar he wrote a whole critique of this elusive entity, ruthlessly censuring those who postulate it: [You believe that] it is not a body, nor is it predicated of anything that is predicated of a body. It is, you claim, the undifferentiated form of things and the element of created objects. The picture of this [entity], you say, exists only in the imagination, and it is impossible to visualize it as a defined entity. . . . Now all this is nonsense!47 And, concerning the theory that natural objects arise out of a prime matter which is not only \"eternal and indestructible, [but also] devoid of all natural and fabricated acts,\" Jabir says: Philosophers dismiss this theory, and they deny the existence of prime matter. To support [their idea of] an object devoid of all acts, the)' [sc. the upholders of this theory] have been able neither to offer a proof of what they claim, nor to establish it by indirect demonstration.48 So Jabir too dispensed with matter, but he did what Aristode had dreaded. Substance was for Aristotle the subject of nine categories of being, while matter, in turn, was the subject of substance. Jabir's substance (jawhar) needs no subject: it is the first subject. The alchemist thus identifies one with the other. Aristotle, we just saw, had declared this confounding \"impossible.\" And confounding it indeed was, for"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"54 CHAPTER 2 Jabir's jawhar has the attributes both of Aristotle's matter, as well as his substance. On the one hand, the Jabirian substance was simple (basit) and unique (wahid), capable of receiving all forms, and belonging to all natural, perceptible things: Substance is that which has the capacity of receiving all things [sc. all categories of being]. It is in everything, and everything arises from it, and everything returns to it.4' This is how the Most High Creator, our Lord, has made it and placed it in everything. Everything reverts to it.50 Indeed, substance (jawhar) is what some people called hayula (hule): It is the jawhar from which arises ... the constitutive frame of this world. A group of people calls it hayula.51 Sometimes the term 'fifth principle' is applied to it: The four natures [sc. hot, cold, moist and dry] are the principles of everything. To these natures there is a fifth principle, namely: the simple substance (al-jawhar al-basit), called hayula.''2 In fact, Jabir uses a number of familiar terms synonymously to designate the same entity. Thus, criticizing the doctrine of the Sabians in the Ahjar, Jabir has in a single passage three different appellations: [They say that] the first . . . stage [in the formation of bodies] is tina53. . . [According to them, when] we see Water turning into Fire, the same jawhar, which was the carrier first of the qualities and dispositions of Water is the carrier now of the qualities and dispositions of Fire. . . . Therefore, [they believe that] the etrernal hayula is one and the same.54 If Aristotle had been among Jabir's audience, he would have simply said that the alchemist is in fact talking about the first subject of properties in bodies, namely matter. While he uses different terms to denote the same entity, this can be condoned as mere verbal vacillation. But then, Aristotle would soon find Jabir totally estranged. For, on the other hand, Jabir's substance exists independendy, it is concrete and differentiated, and—as far as the natural world is concerned—it is visible, though not corporeal in itself. Let us see how this comes about. In Jabir's cosmology the universe is presented as a hierarchy of concentric spheres (afldk, sing, falak) lying under the three Plotinian hypostases, the First Cause (= Demiurge-Creator, al-Bari3), Intelligence (al-^Aql), and Soul (al-Nafi).55 The first sphere under the third THE DOCTRINAL CONTEXT 55 hypostasis, which is often represented as a circle, is the one which embraces our world: \"This circle is the Supreme Luminous Sphere, namely the one which embraces the world in which we are.\"56 In fact, this Supreme Sphere, which is identified with the Ether,57 and which forms the boundary between the three hypostases and the natural world, is the World of Substance (cAlam al-Jawhar).58 In this Supreme Sphere a cosmological process comes to pass which makes substance visible, endows it with a form and a distinct color: As for substance, God protect you, it is the thing by which the interstices are filled (,al-mamlii' bihi al-khalal). It is capable of taking any form. Everything is in it, everything is constituted out of it, and everything dissolves back to it. If this account does not enable you to understand what substance is, then [let me explain further that] it is the dust (,al-haba'), and its color is somewhat white. And when the sun radiates on it, it becomes inflamed and visible. Thus you ought to know that it is the mass (jirm) of the Supreme Luminous Sphere, may its Creator be praised, and His name hallowed. This is the body which is in all three kingdoms of nature, namely animals, plants and stones.5' At another place, the diffuseness of substance, which is indicated by its identification with dust, is categorically stated: Substance is diffused dust (al-haba' al-manthiir). . . With their corpuscularian suggestions, these assertions of Jabir are so remarkable that they deserve a separate study in their own right. However, restricting ourselves to a narrower perspective, we note that our author, in terms of his general approach, continues to operate from within a Neoplatonic mode of thought. He says that substance is what fills up the interstices, the unoccupied space between physical objects. He then equates substance with diffused dust. One can argue that Jabir is here prompted by the same considerations which had led Simplicius to identify Aristotle's first subject with extension. In fact, at one place Jabir does, indeed, visualize substance as empty space.61 And the similarity is deeper: for Simplicius had persistently stressed the diffuseness of extension which put it at the opposite of the unity of the One.62 Evidently, Jabir lacks the philosophical sophistication of Simplicius; he does not offer any arguments for a metaphysical justification of his cosmology, nor is he consistent—but he does seem to be reflecting the concerns of his Neoplatonic predecessor. Plotinus, we recall, had taught that in the hierarchical descent, One (to hen) —> Intelligence (nous) —> Soul (psyche) —» Matter (hule), each intermediate step has something of those on each side of it.63 Jabir's"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"56 CHAPTER 2 Supreme Luminous Sphere also shows an intermediate character appro-priate to the place halfway between the intelligible and the material world: this is the place where it lies, serving as the link between the first three hypostases and the 'world in which we are.' The Supreme Sphere, which was the World of Substance, happened to be the last of the incorporeal, and, simultaneouly, the first of the corporeal beings. By virtue of its incorporeality it was simple and uniform, in which the universal and the particular coincided;64 but at the same time it had certain features of corporeal bodies, for it had parts (mu^allaf),6^ it took part in motion,66 and was subject to time and space.67 The idea of habd3 (dust) is particularly interesting here. What is habd'P68 Fakhr al-Dln al-Razi tells us that it is \"like the cloud of tiny particles {ghubar) which enters a small opening with the ray of the sun,\"69 and, Jabir explains, \"it manifests itself to you (bayyinun laka) when the sun shines on it.\"70 One gets the impression that Jabir is here groping for something incorporeal, yet familiar; an entity endowed with some attributes of material bodies, though not material in itself. The particles of dust must have seemed a good candidate for this intermediate status between the intelligible and the sensible. They became visible only in a ray of the sunlight, but remained invisible otherwise; they could not be held in the hand, nor could they be perceived by any sense other than the sense of sight. So substance: It is not possible for anyone to perceive substance by the sense of touch. Even if someone comes into contact with it, he will not find it perceptible to touch. Nobody can handle substance by his hand. . . 7l Moreover, sheer visibility does not endow corporeality. In explaining the generation of everything from the One, Plotinus had used the metaphor of light,72 conceived strictly as an incorporeal entity.73 Light was visible, but it was not corporeal; it made other things visible, but this was not an instance of material causation. Jabir's notion of the Luminous Sphere, his idea of substance becoming visible and acquiring a color when the sun shines over it—all this is reminiscent of a Plotinian spirit. Jabir's jawhar, as it existed in the Supreme Sphere, was not a body, but there it certainly turned into a 'this'—differentiated, independent, and visible. It was no longer Aristotle's matter, rather it was his substance. Again, this identification of matter with substance is not without parallel in the Neoplatonic tradition. Philoponus, as we have noted, had identified Aristotle's 'first subject' with his indefinite three THE DOCTRINAL CONTEXT 57 dimensional extension. But he had also called this first subject the form, differentia, essence, or essential attribute of body.74 Indeed, if the three dimensional extension is \"the essence of body, then he [sc. Philoponus] is turning it into substance,\"75 As a matter of fact, he explicitly calls it substance: \"The substance of the body is nothing other than the indefinite three dimensional.\"76 Moreover, in the contra Proclum Philoponus goes as far as to say that his indefinite three dimensional can be called body71 THE FOUR NATURES (TABA'I') Jabir has only a limited interest in abstract issues. He introduces them merely for a philosophical bolstering of his own cosmological and alchemical doctrines, and rarely offers logical arguments or proofs. The notion of substance is a case in point. He introduces it as a cosmological necessity, only to slip it into the background. As a practically minded alchemist, he did not have much use for substance: it was common to all things of the world, it was unique, and it did not admit of any alchemical operations. Much more important from an operational point of view were the four Aristotelian elementary qualities. As a matter of fact, Jabir's theory of qualities forms the very core of his entire natural scientific system. \"The whole of Jabirian science,\" wrote Kraus, \"reduces itself to the theory of qualities, their place and their combinations.\"78 This is a penetrating obseravation and has to be taken very seriously. For if one keeps in view the central theme of the Jabirian system—namely to reduce all explanations of the natural world to an explanation of the four qualities—then the gains are many and with far-reaching consequences. It is no small gain, for example, that when Jabir's scientific texts are studied in the context of this reductionism, they appear to bear a clearly recognizable doctrinal unity. In this way their notorious incoherence largely vanishes. In developing his doctrine of qualities on clearly Neoplatonic lines, Jabir moves in a direction far removed from his Hellenistic predecessors. For, breaking with the tradition, he hypostasizes his four qualities. On the one side of the Supreme Sphere, as we have seen, lay the three Plotinian hypostases. But on the other side of it he now places what he calls the World of Simple Elements {cAlam al-'-Anasir al-BasdHt)—significantly, the term 'simple elements' here denotes not the Empedoclean bodies but"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"58 CHAPTER 2 the four qualities hot, cold, moist and dry.79 The Supreme Sphere is represented by a circle; the World of Simple Elements is a smaller concentric circle inside it.80 Like substance, these qualities—or rather, the simple elements—were incorporeal; but they were concrete, differentiated, and independently existing entities.81 As Kraus points out, the idea of the Kitab al-Tasrif (Book of Morphology, Kr 404) to hypostasize the elementary qualities beyond their corporeal existence is not certified in the Neoplatonic tradition. On the contrary, the Hellenistic philosophers had read in the Timaeus that the Heaven was made of the four elements, and, in the world of Ideas, there existed some \"absolute Fire, prototype of the material fire.\"82 Thus, essentially deriving from this doctrine, it was the four Empedoclean elements which the predecessors of Jabir had hypostasized, placing them in the intelligible world. Jabir accords this position to the qualities. And this means that the qualities, not the Empedoclean primary bodies, were the true elements of the natural world. In the intelligible world existed not some \"absolute Fire,\" but the incorporeal hot. But how do these qualities manifest themselves below the sphere of the planets? How does the intelligible turns into the sensible, the incorporeal into the corporeal, and the simple into the compound. Jabir explain the formation of material objects in terms of the doctrine of progressive descent which is central to Neoplatonic metaphysics. At the root of the generation of the corporeal world lay the Desire (shahwa,83 shawq,84 tawqan 85) of the Soul which endowed substance with formative power. At some stage in the complex hierarchy of concentric spheres beneath the Supreme Luminous Sphere, the Soul imparted to substance also a geometric form, a figure which was necessarily spherical. This spherical substance due to the Desire attached itself to one of the four isolate qualities whence it became a corporeal body. This progressive organization of the material world has been explained, for example, in the Kitab Maydan al-'Aql (Book of the Arena of the Intellect, Kr 362): First, we visualize a region of space which is empty (bu'dam ma Id shay'a fih). Then, we imagine a substance which has acquired a form by virtue of which a figure has come to pass in it. This figure can only be spherical. Next, [we visualize] that this mixture [substance + form] is attached to one of four isolate natures [sc. elementary qualities].86 In Jabir's cosmology, a whole series of spheres are conceived as lying in a complex hierarchy under the Supreme Sphere, extending all the way THE DOCTRINAL CONTEXT 59 down to the celestial world.87 Inside the concentric spheres representing the worlds of the four qualities, the Tasrif places another sphere which after some hesitation is called void (khala3).88 And this void is the place where, according to the Kitab al-Mizan al-Sagbir (Small Book of Balance, Kr 369), substance becomes differentiated (in hast-),89 and it is here that the qualities attach to it. This process has been described more fully in the Maydt'.n al-Aql?® Thus, substance according to the desire of the Soul passes through void into the world of elementary qualities and is charged wii:h different quantities of hot, cold, dry and moist. The manner in which substance mingles with qualities is similar to that of \"paste\" (c<z/'i«)91 when soaked in wine, vinegar, honey, etc. When substance takes a definite quantity of, say, hot, its capacity for absorbing other qualifies is reduced. Beneath Jabir's void, both substance and qualities were corporeal entities. All the objects of the natural world ultimately arose out of the attachment of the qualities to substance. The variety of things in our world was reducible to the variety of ways and the variety of quantities in which the qualities attached to substance. And in this way Jabir set out to explain the entire natural world in terms of the four elementary qualities. The four qualities were the first simple elements (al-'-andsir al-basa^it/al-basa^it al-uival) of all bodies. These were uncompounded entities (mufradat) out of which the first compound elements (al-murakkabat), Air, Water, Earth and Fire were formed,92 which latter he sometimes calls \"second elements\" {canasir thawaniri)Specifically, two of the qualities unite with substance to form one of the four Empedoclean elements. Thus, Fire = hot + dry + substance; Earth = cold + dry + substance; etc.94 Further, qualities were not the simple accidents of Aristotle, differentiating prime matter and endowing the elements with actual forms. With regard to the Empedoclean bodies, they possessed a real constitutive character, and took their place, in the hierarchical order of beings, above these elementary bodies.^ Jabir has drifted far away from Aristotle. To be sure, as Kraus has observed, he avoids designating the four qualities by the Aristotelian appellations, dunamis (quwa, sing, quwwa) or poiotes [kayfiyyat, sing. kayfiyya).96 He calls them \"principles\" (usul, sing, asl),97 \"bases\" (arkan, sing, rukn),98 \"first simples,\" \"first elements\"—but most frequently he refers to them by the term \"natures\" {taba^i^, sing. w£c),99 and sometimes explicitly distinguishes them from kayfiyyat.'00 The appellation 'nature' was never used by Aristotle in this sense. Here we"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"60 C HA PTER 2 have, then, a case of a profound conceptual and terminological difference. In fact, once Jabir leaves his cosmological mode of discourse and enters the area of natural philosophy, he spealcs in terms that are clearly mechanistic and materialistic: qualities come to live together, to subsist (halla) in a body.101 But this did not mean the inherence of accidents in a material substratum. Substance unites with (ta^allaqd) the natures;102 it sticks to (^aliqa) them,103 clings to (tashabbatha) them104 and mixes (imtazaja) with them.105 While, on the other hand, the natures attach or cling to one another;106 they enter into a mixture107 and become mingled (ikhtalatd),108 Finally, the natures are composed in or with substance,109 they are implanted in substance;110 the natures attack substance,111 and act upon it112—they shape it,113 embrace it,114 and compress it.115 By conferring on the qualities this independence and corporeality, Jabir has assigned to them the role of true elements. The primitive bodies of the natural world were not the four Empedoclean elements, but the four natures. Air, Water, Earth and Fire, were effectively composed of the natures, and more than that: these Empedoclean bodies could literally be decomposed into the latter. Aristotle had said that to each elementary body there was only one affection—\"each of them is characterized simply by a single quality: Earth by dry rather than by cold, Water by cold . . . , Air by moist . . . , and Fire by hot. . . .\"116 This meant that when, say, Fire is deprived of hot, always the contrary quality, i.e. cold, appeared. Fire which was hot and dry thus became Earth which was cold and dry.117 Jabir's doctrine stands in sharp contrast to this. According to him, we can extract hot from Fire, and in this way reduce the latter to pure dry. This removal of hot does not result in the appearance of cold. Indeed, there did exist bodies which were only hot, or only cold, and so on. How does one extract and isolate a nature from a body? Here is a recipe for the reduction of water to cold: The operation is performed in the following manner. You project water in a cucurbit, where you have placed a substance possessing strong dry, like sulphur or a similar substance. In this way the moist of water will be dried up by the dry [of sulphur] and the hot [of the fire of distillation]. The moist will be entirely burnt, and only the isolated cold will remain.118 The physical characteristics of these isolated natures are also specified. THE DOCTRINAL CONTEXT 61 For example, diy is hard, dull and siccative. Or, it is a dust of atomic constitution, which decreases its volume by the contraction [of its atoms] and increases it by [their] expansion.119 And in the material world, the natures have weights too, so does substance. \"Hot, cold, moist and dry,\" teaches Jabir in the al-Mizdn al-Saghir, \"possess weights, and substance too has a weight: this is inevitable. . . .\"12° Otherwise, the union of two things which are neither visible, nor actually exisdng, would produce nothing. The suggestion to deprive the natures or substance completely of weight was absurd. We have now effectively entered into the original aspects of Jabir's thought, for neither the hypostasizing of the qualities, nor is their corporeality certified anywhere in the standard Greek tradition. Kraus suggested that the idea of qualities as bodies is an indirect borrowing from the Stoics121 for whom, as we know, corporeality was the hallmark of existence.122 However, this does not seem to be the case. The Stoics, acccording to Kraus, \"considered elementary qualities as bodies which due to their active energy inform matter.\"123 But, then, the intention of the Stoics, unlike that of Jabir, was not to treat qualities as so many extra bodies packed into a single body: it was rather a reductionist attempt to represent the qualities of a body as various dispositions of a single body— pneuma disposed in so many different ways.124 The Stoics embraced a theory of categories and they \"sometimes thought of quality in terms of the third category—matter, or pneuma, or soul, or reason disposed in a certain way. For the Stoic materialists, each of these . . . would be thought of as body. [However], they would not be four distinct bodies, for pneuma is soul and reason, and all of them are matter variously disposed. The [Stoic] idea about qualities ... is strongly reductionist.\"125 Thus the qualities cannot be corporealsubstances. \"I do not see,\" declares Sorabji, \"that the view owes anything to the Stoics as Kraus suggests.\"126 Indeed, there are both terminological and conceptual links between Jabir's doctrine of qualities and that found in ps-Apollonius' Sirr al-Khaliqa. Likewise, the writings of Job of Edessa carry views which are significantly close.127 \"Listen to what I say to you!,\" commands ps-Apollonius, \"all things are from the four natures (.tabaHc) namely hot, cold, moist (al-lin) and dry.... All of them move in a circle about the same center.... All of them are from the same substance . . . which is homogeneous {la ikhtilaf fihi) until accidents come to pass in it. When"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"62 CHAPTER 2 this happens, it breaks up and its parts become different from one another. . . ,\"128 Again, \"when the Sphere (al-faLak) moves perpetually and becomes vigorous in its motion, the four natures form pairs (izJawajat), one with the other. They become different, and one knows one pair from the other by its essence and form.\"129 The term tabaHc, the hypostasizing of the qualities, the pairing of these entities through some cosmological process in the intelligible world—all this is shared by Jabir. And like Jabir, Job of Edessa also believes that the simple elements of all bodies are hot, cold, moist and dry, while the most fundamental bodies, Air, Water, Earth and Fire are compound elements (canasir murakkaba) made of hot, cold, moist and dry. The four qualities should be viewed as substances (usiyas), wrote the Syriac author of the Book of Treasures,^0 these are not accidents [gesdsi) or properties belonging to a substance.131 In another work of Job of Edessa, the Kitab al-Tafiir (Book of Interpretation) which is quoted in Maqdisi's Kitab Bad3 wa al-Ta^rikh (Book of Origins and History, comp. 355/966), certain assertions are almost identical to Jabir's. \"The principles (mabadp = Gr. archai) of all things,\" we read, \"are isolate elements (al-lanasir al-mufrada), namely, hot (hart•), cold {bard), moist (balla) and dry (yubs). By the combination (tarkib) of these, the compound elements (al-^anasir al-murrakaba), namely Air, Water [etc] ... are formed.\"132 These assertions could well have come out of a Jabirian text. The eclecticism of Jabir is now evident. In fact, he is quite aware of this feature of his ideas: [My] affirmations will be equally valid for those who profess the existence of natures without substratum (hamil); for those who accept accidents alone to the exclusion of bodies;13'* as well as for those who say, on the contrary, that the accident is invisible, and that all things are, rather, bodies.13\"' QUANTIFICATION OF QUALITIES AND THE SCIENCE OF BALANCE Let us now turn to the most important, most interesting, and most productive aspect of Jabir's theory of qualities. If, in the natural world, qualities are corporeal, and if they possess weights, then they should in principle be amenable to quantitative treatment. Indeed, the four Jabirian natures were not only quantifiable, they were also subject to measurement, and they admitted of a whole range of quantitative THE DOCTRINAL CONTEXT 63 manipulations. And here, from the standpoint of the history of filiation of ideas, we have something rather significant. For like the attempts to quantify qualities at Montpellier and Oxford in the early 14th century A.D., Jabir's quantification of his taba^i' also makes an appearance in a medico-pharmacological perspective. In fact, the two attempts, namely the Jabirian and the Latin, bear fundamental similarities of a formal and methodological nature. Recent scholars have stressed the importance of two pioneering Latin works in the modern history of the mathematization of medicine in general, and that of pharmacy in particular: the Aphorismi de gradibus composed at Montpellier around 1300 A.D.,136 and the Icocedron, a Mertonian work postdating the former by a few years.137 It is interesting to note that both these works are written by authors known to be alchemists—namely, Arnald of Villanova and Walter of Odington respectively. Also, it has been shown that these two writings were the direct precursors of the famous dynamical law of Thomas Bradwardine, hence their significance in the history of physics.138 And, most important from our point of view, both the Aphorismi and Icocedron have been found to be dependent on the Fi Ma'-rifat Quwd al-Adwiyat al-Murakkaba (On the Knowledge of the Intensity of Compound Medicines, Lat. Quia primos) of the well-known and the earliest Arab philosopher (sc.faylasuf), al-Kindi (d. c. 257/870).139 What are the salient features of all these attempts?140 First, all four of them—Jabir, al-Kindi, Arnald and Walter—aim at making more precise, elaborate and fuller the Galenic classification of simple drugs according to the degrees (taxeis) of intensity of each quality in them. Indeed, Jabir's interests go far beyond drugs into a general methodology for measuring the quantities of the four natures in all things belonging to all three kingdoms of the natural world. Jabir further distinguishes himself from his three counterparts by replacing Galen's classification scheme with a more sophisticated computational system claimed to be founded upon universal theoretical principles, rather than upon the empirical generalizations of medical experience.141 Second, al-Kindi makes a very important and conceptually fruitful distinction between the intensity of a quality and its extension. Thus, in effect, he distinguishes between heat and temperature. Arnald and Walter not only followed him in maintaining this distinction, they placed a strong emphasis on it—something that in the Latin West proved particularly germane to a critical examination of the nature of heat.142"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"64 CHAPTER 2 But in Jabir too we find a conceptual distinction between intensity and extension—in fact, as we shall see, one of the grounds on which he criticizes Galen is this very confounding of the two. And, finally, through one quantitative mathematical formula or another, all four authors—Jabir, al-Kindi, Arnald and Walter—relate the intensive qualities of bodies with their extensive characteristics. The specific relationship proposed by al-Kindi, and which was accepted by Arnald as well as Walter, is one which links a geometric increase in the number of 'parts' of a quality to an arithmetic increase in the sensed effect.143 As for Jabir's system, it will presently be our subject for a detailed study, but in the meantime it should be noted that the validity of the formulae of al-Kindi and his Latin scions is, once again, limited to drugs. Jabir, on the other hand, considers his quantitative system as having an unlimited scope, applicable universally to all things of the natural world. We see, then, that from a substantive point of view, Jabir seems to be at the head of the al-Kindi-Arnald-Walter quantificationist tradition. Yet we have no direct historical evidence at hand to support this conclusion. Indeed, if we accept Kraus' late dating of the Jabirian corpus, the evidence might even appear to point to the contrary, for then the question of al-Kindl's familiarity with the ideas of Jabir would hardly arise. Likewise, no scholar has so far pointed out any textual indication that Arnald of Villanova, or Walter of Odington had direct access to the mediaeval Latin translations of the Jabirian texts. We can only suspect an indirect Latin familiarity with Jabirian ideas through the writings ascribed to Geber.144 Evidendy, these are involved questions and it seems prudent to leave them at this juncture. But let us proceed with a closer look at Jabir's system. Galen, we recall, had accepted the 'fourfold' schema which had brought the four Hippocratic humors, the elementary qualities, and the Empedoclean elements into common accord.145 Drawing upon Aristotle's idea of contraries, he had believed that when one of the bodily humors develops to the detriment of others, destroying the humoral equilibrium, the body loses health. The medicament for countering the harmful effects of the excess humor was therefore required to possess a quality contrary to that of the humor. It was this great general principle of cure by contraries which served as the rationale for the classification of simple drugs according to their pharmaceutical potencies.146 THE DOCTRINAL CONTEXT 65 This was a classification in terms of the opposing pair of primary qualities: a medicine was determined either to be hot or cold, and, less significantly, either dry or moist. Galen further assigned to these qualities a scale of measurement in degrees. Introducing a scale of four degrees, he classified the action of drugs according to the supposedly innate degrees of hot, cold, moist and dry they possessed. According to Galen, in each quality four degrees of intensity could be distinguished: the first included ordinary food whose elementary quality is hardly appreciable, the second degree of intensity was found in weak medicines and stronger food, the third in medicines whose effects were appreciably severe, and, finally, the fourth degree included poisons which were so strong as to destroy the body.147 This numerical specification had found its way into the Arabic medical tradition through which it continued in Latin medical writers. Like the Greek physicians, Jabir accepts that, in practice, all bodies possess all the four qualities: when we say that such and such body is hot or cold, it simply means that the hot or cold has come to dominate the other three.148 But as for the Galenic approach to the classification of drugs, Jabir is highly critical of it—he dismisses it both on empirical as well as rational grounds. To begin with, it was an arbitrary classification, for it grouped together a very large number of drugs under a single degree of intensity of a given quality.149 But, argues Jabir, even if all the drugs allegedly of the same group did show comparable effects, the quantity of the quality in each of them was different. For example, among the drugs classified under the third degree of hot, \"we definitively know that the hot in sugar (al-sukkar) is not the same as the hot in aniseed (al-anhun). Nor is it the same as the hot which is in colocynth (shahm al-hanzal), nor the same as the hot in euphorbia (farbiyiin,J.\"150 To translate Jabir in modern terms, a number of bodies may have the same extensive effect (temperature), but they do not necessarily possess the same quantity of intensity (heat) producing that effect. Secondly, the Galenic classifications were refuted by experience. For, says Jabir, if we take all the drugs which are supposed to belong to the same degree of intensity, and administer them in identical doses (measured in terms of weight), their effects will not be identical. Thus, for example, among the drugs belonging to the third Galenic degree of hot, only one dirham [dir.] of euphorbia (farbiyun) produces the same effect as 2 dir. of scammony (saqmuniya), 10 dir. of turpeth {ghariqun), and 20 dir. of white agaric {ghariqun). Similarly, Jabir continues, in terms of extensive effects, Vi dir. of colocynth = 2 dir. of dodder of Crete"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"66 CHAPTER 2 (al-afithlmun al-iqritt) = 3 dir. of habb al-nll}^ etc. These drugs, then, did not have equal strengths: to classify them all under the third degree of hot was unsystematic and arbitrary.152 Next, Jabir attacks the physician's classifiaction on rational grounds. The knowledge of Galen's four degrees of intensity (taxeis) of each quality in a thing rested exclusively on the senses. But the testimony of the senses could not be trusted. Colors and smells are not reliable guides to the constitution of a body, writes Jabir in the Bahth: one color may represent each of the four qualities; and as for smells, they may turn putrid in which case one smell is likely to be confused with another. Likewise, taste is no indication of a body's qualities—indeed, a large number of bodies, such as gold and silver, had no taste whatsoever. It was obvious that sense experience could not be taken as reliable basis for the exact determination of the preponderant quality in a body, much less the intensity of this quality.153 Jabir is thus seeking a theoretical system that goes beyond the fallible empirical impressions of the superficial senses. And in doing so, he stands aloof in the medical tradition which had viewed itself as essentially grounded in experience. Prior to the 14th century A.D., a recent scholar tells us, \"physicians . . . were nearly unanimous in insisting that in practice medicine was an experiential art in which certain knowledge could never be achieved.\"154 Indeed, it was Galen's dictum that a knowledge of the properties of simples comes only by experiment. Commenting on this dictum, the 4th/10th century physician cAli ibn cAbbas al-Majusi (Lat. Haly Abbas)155 had \"remarked despairingly that a full experimental knowledge would take a thousand men a thousand years, and his statement was repeatedly quoted in the Midddle Ages.\"156 For Jabir there is no cause for such despair. He simply rejects empiricism in favor of a philosophical system of eternal truths which alone, he believes, could serve as the theoretical foundation of scientific knowledge. Jabir feels that the physicians' classification of drugs operates in a theoretical vacuum. But before supplying this deficiency, he proceeds to make an algorismic improvement in the computational structure of Galenic degrees. Without a refined system of subdivisions, he thinks, these degrees were crude units: even if one were to distinguish in each Galenic degree a minimum (awtual aL-martaba), a maximum (dkhir), and a mean (wasat) value of intensities, the precision of the result is hardly improved.157 Thus, Jabir proposes a much extended scheme of elaborate subdivisions. One degree (martaba) is divided into certain number of THE DOCTRINAL CONTEXT 67 grades (daraja), a grade into minutes (daqiqa),158 a minute into seconds (thaniya), a second into thirds (thalitha), a third into fourths (rdbi'-a), and, finally, a fourth into fifths (khamisa).159 Since all natural bodies contained all the four qualities, there were now 4 (qualities) x 4 (degrees) x 7 (subdivisions) =112 different positions,160 as opposed to Galen's 16. It is significant that Jabir borrows the names of his units from ancient astronomy. His aim is to elevate the practice of medicine to the infallibility of an exact science. In fact, he sometimes emulates completely the astronomical units of measurement: in the Ahjar, the units of his Ballnas follow a geometric progression with 60 as its base. Thus, 60 fifths = 1 fourth; 60 fourths = 1 third [= 602 fifths]; 60 thirds = 1 second [= 603 fifths]; 60 seconds = 1 minute [= 604 fifths], etc.161 But how does one measure the strengths or intensities of qualities in a body? Or, more generally, how does one discover the quantitative structure of the objects of the physical world? It is here that Jabir's Science of Balance (cIlm al-Mizdn) makes an entry. This was a universal science par excellence, a divine science (cilm lahuti)162 whose aim was to reduce all facts of human knowledge to a system of quantity and measure.163 The scope of this Science was not limited merely to the measurement of qualitative potencies of drugs—in fact, \"all things fall under the [principle of] Balance,\"164 and \"it is by means of this principle that man is able to make sense of the world.\"165 The principle of Balance was truly cosmic in its range. On the one hand it governed the sublunar world (ajnds tha lat ha),166 submitting all change, generation and corruption to the exactness of mathematical laws. On the other hand, it served to measure the distances and movements of the celestial bodies and even linked them to the hypostases of the intelli-gible world—just as physical bodies had a balance, Soul and Intelligence had balances too.167 The principle of Balance was the Supreme Principle (Qa'ida cUzmd) of the world.168 In the natural world, to give merely an outline of Jabir's doctrine, all bodies contained the four qualities in a specific, immutable, and noble proportion which was governed by the Supreme Principle.169 This proportion was 1:3:5:8 whose sum 17 (=1+3+5+8) was the foundation (qa'-ida) of the entire Science of Balance. Thus, if in a body the qualities are arranged in the order hot, dry, cold and moist, and if the hot weighs 1 dir., then: dry will be 3 dir., cold will be 5 dir, and moist will be 8 dir. The alchemist who has mastered the Science discovers through this proportion the quantitative structure of all things. He is then able to change anything into any other by creating in"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"68 CHAPTER 2 it a new configuration of qualities.170 In fact, he can even change inanimate objects into living beings.171 Likewise, by means of the Science of Balance the adept uncovers the inner structure of the precious metals, and then effects transmutations of base metals into precious ones by bringing in the former the qualitative structure of the latter—this is carried out by augmenting those qualites which are weak and suppressing those which are excessive. But this is Jabir's docrine only in its bare oudine. To its development, elaboration, and explanation he devotes a whole collection of texts which he calls the Kutub al-Mawazin (Books of Balances). The Ahjar, which occupies a central position in this collection, is the subject of a detailed textual examination in the chapters that follow. THE DOCTRINAL CONTEXT 69 NOTES 1 Muslim philosophers in general espoused this orthodoxy, with al-Farabi devoting to it a whole treatise, namely Kitab al-Jamc bayna Ra^yay al-hakimayn Afldtun al-Ildhi wa Aristiitalis (Harmony between the Views of the Two Philosophers, Plato the Divine and Aristode). See Walzer s.v. \"al-Farabi,\" [EI2], II, p. 778; Mahdi [1962], 2 It should be added at once that Neoplatonism, or even Hellenism in general, was not the only mode of thought inherited by Islam from the ancient world. When Alexandria fell in 21/641, the Arab conquest of the Near East was virtually complete, and with this came the legacy of many Hellenized centers of learning that had flourished in the first six centuries of the Christian era, and where many indigenous ideas had been integrated with the Greek tradition. But in 47/667, the Muslim armies crossed the river Oxus, and by 95/713 Sind and Transoxiania had come within the expanding fold of Islam. And on the Western side, cAbd al-Rahman I had inaugurated his Andalusian Umayyad dynasty in the 3rd decade of the 2nd/middle of the 8th century. Thus there was, in fact, more in the Arab booty than the Hellenistic legacy of the Near East. Ruska, for example, points in his [1926] to Central Asia as an important locus for the role it played in integrating and transmitting the human cultures of the West, East and South. And, singling out Harran (class. Carrhae), Kraus had identified the Sabians as a group which seemed to have served as the agency for the transmission to Islam not only of Neopythagorean, Hermetic and Gnostic doctrines, but also of indigenous Chaldean 'Nabatean' notions, and certain characteristically Chinese ideas and things. (Kraus [1942-3], II, p. 305 ff.) Cf. Pingree [1973]. To be sure, Jabir himself displays a great deal of eclecticism, and it is not at all clear what his immediate and specific sources are. However, as far as his cosmology is concerned, a Neoplatonic substratum is its most striking feature, and it is this feature which provides the perspective in which his cosmological doctrines are here being examined. But this is not to say that Jabir is a Neoplatonist. 3 The expression Prote hule (primary matter) is very rarely used by Aristode.

It is now generally accepted that the Arabic translation of Porphyry's Eisagogewas the first entry of Aristode into the Muslim world (see Peters [1968], p. 11). The MS Beirut, Univ. St. Joseph 338, names Ibn al-Muqaffac (d. 143/760) as the translator, and this is accepted by Furlani (see his [1926]). In his [1965], Richard Frank has attempted to show that Neoplatonism had reached Islam as early as the first half of the 2nd/8th century: he talks about the Neoplatonism of Jahm ibn Safwan, an early mutakallim who died in 129/746. (But see Zimmermann [1986] in which Frank's conclusions have been challenged). 29 See Rosenthal [1952]; [1953]; [1955]; Badawi, ed.

For example, Aristode says in the De Coelo that one must suppose as many distinct species of matter as there are bodies (4.5, 312b)—in other words matter if differentiated! Perhaps these were the considerations that led some scholars to deny that Aristotle believed in prime matter at all.

Jabir here quotes a verse of the Qur'an in which this phrase occurs (Sura al-Furqan, 23). 61 Plato had introduced the idea of the 'Receptacle' in Timeaus 48e-53c, which he identified with space (khora). He viewed space as a receptacle which received qualities, and these qualities were copies of Forms. This idea had inspired, both in the Greek as well as Arabic traditions, the identification of matter with some kind of a qualityless extended entity. Indeed, Simplicius does refer to Plato's Timaeus, and we have in Arabic a text entitled \"Naql Afldturi' (Transmission of Plato, MS Berlin 5031) in which hule (hayiila) is explicitly identified with space (al-Makan): \"In the Timaeus he [sc. Plato] said that hayuld and balad (lit. geographical space) are one and the same thing. And since hayuld is balad, and balad is space (al-Makdn), what Plato inevitably means is that the intellect is the space for the natural forms. . . . Space does not have a shape or figure, and is without qualities. ...\" See Arabic text in the addenda below. For an excellent account of Simplicius see Sorabji, op. cit., pp. 3-21.

Sorabji, op. cit., p. 34; see also p. 17 and p. 21). Matter was an \"indefinite diffusion\" (Khusis aoristos). It was also a source of stretching, diffusion and indefiniteness.

Thus, one might say that it is irrelevant what the Stoics really meant when they said that qualities were bodies. Our concern should be with the way the Stoics were received and perceived by the Arabs. But—given that there is no evidence of a direct transmission, and that the scope of the present work must remain narrow—to take up this question is to digress. 127 We met these authors in Chapter 1 above. 128 Sirr, Weisser ed.

Huart [1899-1919], I, p. 140. 133 Jabir seems to be referring here to an interpretation of Plato's Theaetetus that properties need no subject—that bodies are just a bundle (hathroisma, sundrome) of properties (see \"Bodies as Bundles of Properties\" in Sorabji [1988]). This question is taken up also by Plutarch (Stoicorum veterum fragmenta, 2.126, von Arnim ed. [1903-24]). 134 al-Ashcari in his Maqalat attributes this view to the 2nd/8th century mutakallim Dirar ibn cAmr (See Ritter ed. [1963]. For a critical discussion see van Ess [1967]; [1968]). 135 al-Mizan, MS Paris 5099, f. 123a. Again, such views are attributed to some early mutakallims such as al-Nazzam (see al-Ashcari, Ritter ed. [1963]). In fact it seems that in all three cases (natures without substratum, reduction of bodies to accidents, and denial of accidents) Jabir may well be referring to the debates in the early kaldm cosmology. A reading of the Maqalat tends to support this view. Kaldm cosmology has been discussed by van Ess, op. cit. 136 McVaugh [1967]; [1969]; [1975]. 137 Skabelund and Thomas [1969]. 138 Natural philosophers at the beginning of the 14th century A.D. supposed that an object's speed was arithmetically related to its motive force and resistence, V a F/R. Bradwardine proposed a law of proportionality arguing that \"the proprtion of velocities in motion follows the proportion of the power of the motor to the power of the thing moved\" (qu. McVaugh, [1967], p. 56). His elaboration makes it clear that he is suggesting the following relationship: V = loga (F/R), where a = FJ/RJ. (See n. 143 below). 139 It was Marshall Clagett who first suspected a connection between Bradwardine's law and the system devised by Kind! to measure the qualitative intensity of compound medicines (Clagett [1959] Chap.7). This question was taken up by McVaugh in his [1967], [1969] and [1975], and by Skabelund and Thomas [1969]. These researches have confirmed Clagett's suspicions. McVaugh in his [1967] suggested the following filiation: Kindl-Arnald-Bradwardine, to which Skabelund and Thomas added Walter of Odington as the link between Arnald and Bradwardine. Siggel has studied a 1759 A.D. Arabic version of Kindi's work (Siggel [1953]). 140 Kindi's system has been discussed in detail by McVaugh in his [1975]. But Skabelund and Thomas [1969] also provide a good summary. Arnald's work is the subject of McVaugh's [1967], [1969] and [1975], whereas the latter authors have presented a comprehensive account of Walter's Icocedron. THE DOCTRINAL CONTEXT 77 141 See below. 142 Skabelund and Thomas, op. cit., passim. McVaugh [1967], passim; [1975], passim; [1969], p. 405. 143 According to Kindi, the degree of intensity (I) of a compound drug can be determined by adding up 'parts' of hot and of cold contained in the simple constituents (each of known degree) and determining their ratio. Since H/C = 7\\, I = loga (H/C), where a = 2. The system of both Arnald and Walter are modally identical to this, and Bradwardine seems simply to have imported it into natural philosophy. 144 Walter of Odington does refer to Geber (see Skabelund and Thomas [1969], p. 334). 145 See Schoner [1964] p. 86 ff. 146 McVaugh [1969], p. 399. 147 The subject is covered in Galen's De simplicium medicamentorum, Bk. 3; the scale of four degrees is introduced in Chap. 13 (See Kiihn ed. [1821-33]). 148 Jabir develops this point in the Bahth, MS Jarullah 1721 (see quotations in Kraus [1942-3] passim). 149 See quotations from the Bahth in Kraus, ibid., II, p. 191, nn. 2-3. 150 Bahth MS Jarullah 1721, f. 126a.

Viewed as metaphysical doctrine, it embodied a universal principle which governed not only the sublunar world of generation and corruption, but also that which lay beyond the Sphere (al-FalaH) in the intangible (ghayr malmusa) realm of the hypostases. Thus we read in the Ahjar that there is a characteristic Balance of the stars, their distances, and their, movements; and there is a Balance by means of which the Sphere manifests itself to man. But over and above these, there are Balances even of the Soul and the Intelligence,1 \"beyond Which there is no end\" {Id nihaya ba'ddhalik).2 As a methodological thesis, Jabir's Balance was the 'way' (tariq)3 through which one understood, made sense of, and, above all, measured and manipulated the objects and the processes of the universe. And since the universe was diverse, so were the Balances. These Balances also formed a hierarchy: while all of them were useful {mufid), and all of them served the aim of attaining scientific knowledge, the best of all Balances was the Balance of Letters {Mlzan al-huruf)-. The Balances are divided according to the diversity of natural objects. There are Balances of the Intelligence, of the Soul, of Nature, Form, and the Sphere of the stars; there are Balances of the four natures, animals, plants, and minerals—these are all useful Balances. But, finally, there is the Balance of Letters: and this is the most perfect of all!4 This 'most perfect Balance' which is also called the Balance of Articulation {Mizdn al-Hija^ and the Balance of Utterance (Mizan Lajzi),6 is further characterized elsewhere: A group of people says that the knowledge of matters relating to the four natures {ahwal al-taba'i^), as well as an understanding of the qualities (kayfiyyat)/ may be attained by a more suitable method: that is, by means of the names (asmd3) of foods, drugs, organs of animals, and parts of animals and plants. We have called this method the Balance of Letters. In it lies a meticulous science ('ilm daqiq)8 through which one reaches an understanding of the real characteristics of natural objects {haqaHq ahwal al-mawjuddt)? 81"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"82 CHAPTER 3 Indeed, Jabir does raise his Balance of Letters doctrine to a highly sophisticated level, defending and justifying it on powerful, and often cogent, logical and metaphysical grounds. And in the process we find him articulating a comprehensive theory of knowledge, language, and music. Thus, under one central principle, namely Mlzan al-Huruf Jabir attempts a grand philosophical synthesis in which his four natures systematically and coherendy relate to phonetics and morphology on the one hand, and to prosody and musical harmony on the other. From all this emerges the ontological counterpart of his reductionist thesis: we have seen that in Jabir's physics all explanations of the natural world were reduced to an expiation of the four natures—now he proposes an ontological equivalence between the natures and the alphabetical characters, characters which portrayed the elements of articulated speech. The Kitab al-Ahjar\\s devoted to an elaboration of this very thesis.10 Let us begin by isolating Jabir's claims. Just as the words of language, he says, are composed of letters, so denominated things are composed of natures. This was not a simple analogy; rather, it implied an effective and real coordination between the letters of a word which names an object, and the physical structure of the object itself; between the science of morphology which studies the structure of words, and the science of physics which studies the structure of things. \"Look!\" he writes in the Kitab af Tasrif (Rook of Morphology), how letters are copied upon the natures (wudiLat Said al-tabdH£) and how the natures are copied upon letters, and how the letters and natures interchange (tunqalu)\" The morphological analysis of words made it possible to determine the quantitative and qualitative structure of things they designate. The order of letters in a name was an actual representation of the order of the natures in the object named. Similarly, the numerical values assigned to the letters of the alphabet revealed, and were equivalent to, actual quantities of the natures comprising the thing in whose name these letters occurred.12 This letter-nature correspondence is stated categorically and forcefully: A single isolated letter (harf) cannot be pronounced.13 It is clear that we cannot speak by means of an isolated letter [harf here meaning phoneme] unless we attach to it another letter [= phoneme]. Similarly, it is not possible for us to know the weight of a nature [sc. to know that it exists in relation to us], unless it unites with another nature and thus becomes intelligible—so know this principle!1^ THE CENTRAL THEME 83 An individual thing cannot exist with less than two elements [sc. natures] ... it may have three elements, but it cannot exist with a single element—this is impossible.1^ Correspondingly, words—for example \"Muhammad or Ja'far —exist only in virtue of a combination of letters. A word may have two letters; it may have three letters, or less than three. But it cannot exist with a single isolated letter—this is equally impossible. A word cannot be with less than two letters: a letter of articulation (harfal-nutcf) and a letter of rest (harf dl-istiraha), and this is required for vocal emission.16 So consequently, the combination of letters corresponds to the combination of the natures in all natural objects.17 The grammarians, writes Jabir in the Tasrif, treat the morphology of words and discuss the letters of which the words are composed. Correspondingly, the philosophers have a morphology of their own which applies to the elements (basd^it = taba^ic) of bodies. Thus, grammar and physics follow homologous methodological procedures. This is the reason why he had called this work the \"Book of Morphology,\"18 for: there can be no discourse (kaldm) except through a composition of letters [= phonemes] (taHifal-huruf), and a similar situation necessarily exists in the case of the natures ... In fact, the morphology of the natures (tasrifal-tabdHl) bears a parallel in the morphology of letters (tasrif al-huruf).1 ' But the term \"harf\" we pause here to note, seems to be appearing in two different senses—sometimes meaning 'letter of the alphabet'; at other times, 'primary phonetic unit' or 'phoneme.' To be sure, a considerable confusion would result out of this terminological duality, but there is no conceptual ambiguity here. For, as we shall soon see, harf as phoneme (sound) and harf as representation o/phoneme (alphabetical characters) were unambiguously recognized as two ontologically distinct entities in the Jabirian metaphysics: the former considered to be universal and immutable; while the latter was a mere convention and therefore subject to improvement and change. We are told further that perfect representation of utterances which made up articulated speech (nutq) constituted an ideal, existing only in potentiality; writing was a human attempt to bring this ideal into 'actuality.' Thus alphabetical characters were no more than a portrayal by means of lines (tamthil al-khutut), and [a process of] bringing it [sc. the enuciated word] from potentiality into actuality.20 Being a matter of convention, these portrayals, or 'signs' (ashkal), could change and evolve; in fact they needed to:"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"84 CHAPTER 3 If one were to replace . . . similar signs [of the Arabic script] by dissimilar signs people would be saved from corruption and mistakes of language. This is where the flaw of the inventor (nazim) lies. [Such reform] is in effect possible not just in the nature of writing, but also in its power to evolve.21 Thus, the Arabic script was corrupted by flaws and imperfections. But if this is the case, how can something that is conventional and imperfect (alphabetical characters) signify in a uinque way something that is natural and universal (the four natures)? Clearly, it seems that when Jabir claims an immutable relationship between the natures and the letters, he means ideal letters—not the 'lines' or 'signs' which constituted the actual characters of the Arabic script, but the ideal representations of utterances which existed only in potentiality. Yet, in practice, one had no choice but to operate with the actual letters of the alphabet which, though imperfect, were the closest approximations to the ideal. At the same time, as we just read, efforts must be made to minimize the flaws of the Arabic script in order that the accuracy of this approximation is improved. It seems, then, that there are not two but three distinct senses in which the term \"harf\" is employed by Jabir: (i) letter of the alphabet, (ii) primary element of speech (phoneme), and (iii) ideal representation of the primary elements of speech. Speaking in theoretical (and rigorous) Jabirian terms, there was an ontological equivalence between the natures and the ideal representations of the primary units of speech. But as an approximation for practical purposes, the natures were assumed to be equivalent to the actual letters of the Arabic alphabet; and this is what Jabir is mostly concerned with, for his interests lie more in applications than in theory. In order to make sense of Jabir, it is important to keep all this in mind; otherwise, his doctrine will appear to us—as it does to Kraus—not only internally inconsistent22 but also contradictory.23 But let us now proceed. THE QUANTIFICATION OF LANGUAGE Going back to the passages just quoted, we see Jabir employing another term \"ta^lif\" which has been rendered \"composition.\" But this term has strict numerical connotations in its Jabirian usage, and is applied equally to music. Musical harmony, the Ahjar tells us, is no more than a numerical composition {ta^lif^adadi), and it is the same composition that occurs in speech.24 Thus conforming to a fundamental Pythagorean idea that harmomy of numbers produces music, Jabir makes a further claim THE CENTRAL THEME 85 that language too was a harmony of numbers: language and music were governed by the same principles, they were thus essentially related. This seems to be the reason why, as we shall witness in the Ahjar, Jabir is interested in language fundamentally from the point of view of phonetics, morphology, and metrics. All these were reducible to quantities and their combinations.25 Phonetics is concerned with sounds and therefore its relationship with music was easily established. In the Ahjar, Jabir draws a parallel between the fingers of the player of a musical instrument on the one hand, and the tongue, throat and the lips of a speaker on the other. In fact there was a structural correspondence between the physical organs of speech and the sounds which derive from them, just as there was a correspondence between the structure of a musical instrument and the music that it generates: The letters [= phonemes] may derive their vocal articulation from the natures. There are in the throat several sources of vocal emission of letters [= phonemes] ,2^ As for the actual letters of the alphabet, and here the distinction between these and phonemes is categorically and unambiguously stated, they were designated figures for the denotation of sounds. Thus, we read in the Kitab al-Hudud that letters are designated figures which by general agreement (biH-muwada'-a) indicate articulated sounds. By convention, the ordered composition of these figures signifies meanings (macdni). And in this way, letters were related to meanings. In fact, meanings were forms, and the object of letters was to evoke these forms: This is the definition of meanings: they are the forms intended by the letters.28 The homology between music and meaningful utterances was evident: just as there existed sounds which were musical, and those which were not, so there existed sounds which carried meaning (bi-ma'-nan tahtuhu), and those which did not (bi ghayr ma'-nan).29 And just as for a sound to be musical it had to follow natural rules of music, for it to be meaningful it had to follow natural rules of phonetics—both these sets of rules were governed by quantities and their combinations. Thus, treating letters solely from a phonetic point of view, Jabir tells us in the Ahjar that the maximum number of moving (vocalized) and quiescent (non vocalized) consonants that can cluster in a row is naturally fixed.30 Elsewhere,31 he"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"86 CHAPTER 3 classifies the letters of the alphabet according exclusively to their phonetic value—there were some letters which were sonorous (majhiira), others which were 'deaf (al-summ),32 yet others were literaeproductionis (huriif al-liri), and so on.33 Morphology is treated by Jabir as if it were a branch of arithmetic—a science of numbers and their permutations.34 Indeed, in the context of the Arabic language this does not seem too far-fetched. Arab grammarians had pointed out at an early date that a vast majority of the words of their langauge were traceable to a consonantal root with a fixed number of radicals. Once these roots were discovered, almost the entire Arabic vocabulary could be built up by different permutations of the vowels adjoined to these radicals, by rearranging the radicals, and by adding other letters to these radicals.35 Thus the Arabic language easily lent itself to a quantitative treatment—a feature fully exploited by Jabir. In our text Jabir gives us a whole set of rules for restituting the root of a word (radd ila^l-asl) so that its structure exactly reproduced the structure of the thing it named. The task of the expert of Balance (Sahib al-Mizan) was to reduce a word to its primitive elements by identifying and removing all the additions, and reversing all the variations it had undergone. Once this was done, the analysis of the word would correspond to the analysis of the object of which it was the name. Thus, feminine designations, additions made to the radicals to denote the dual and the plural, the inflexions of the noun {i'-raB), and of the verb {tasrif), the article, and all other augmentations must be stripped away to extract the primitive core—this is what Jabir calls in the Ahjar \" isqat / ittirah al-zawa^id.\"^ He also specifies the letters which are in general to be regarded as additions to the radicals, they were ten in number. Clearly, all this is borrowed from the Arab grammarians.37 Again, in agreement with the grammarians, Jabir classifies Arabic roots according to the number of radicals. In the Ahjar he distinguishes three types of roots: triliteral {thulathi), quadriliteral {ruba'i), and quinqueliteral (khumasi).38 He then gives different permutations of the vowels modifying the structure of a root, yielding 12 paradigms {awzdn) of triliteral roots, 5 of quadriliteral, and 4 of quinqueliteral roots.39 But this was a mathematical exercise constrained by semantic and phonetic conventions, for many more paradigms are possible if one treated the radicals, as well as the adjoining vowels and the sukun,40 as symbols of a formal arithmetic system. Indeed, this is precisely what Jabir does in his Kitab al-Hasil. THE CENTRAL THEME 87 In the Hasilwe find our alchemist taking a special delight in churning out virtually endless lists of roots that can arise out of all possible permutation and combinations of the 28 letters of the Arabic alphabet. This produced a large number of unknown and novel words. Conventionally, these words had no meaning, but it was quite conceivable, Jabir felt, that in times to come they would be incorporated into the Arabic vocabulary. Thus, to construct biliteral roots, Jabir combines to the first letter of the alphabet, alif, each of the 28 letters one at a time—this yielded 28 letter pairs. The same treatment is given to the second letter, ba3. In constructing the triliteral roots, he gives all the possible arrangements of the three radicals, 6 in total (=3x2x1), to manufacture an enormous body of words with three consonants.41 We are told that quadriliteral roots admitted of 24 different combinations (=4x3x2x1), and quinqueliteral roots of 120 (=5x4x3x2x l).42 All this is aimed at illustrating the same fundamental idea: namely that language, like music, was governed by the laws of quantities and their combinations. Equally, Jabir exploits the quantitative nature of the already familiar Arabic metrics. The phonetic characteristics of the Arabic language, as well as the superficial features of its script, had contributed to an early rise in Islam of a science of prosody (cilm al-^arud.) based solely on quantitative considerations.43 Classical Arabic verse is a 'quantitative' verse, in that its rhythm is attained by regularly recurring sequences of short and long syllables, forming metrical 'feet' which last the same length of time—a quality it shares with ancient Greek poetry.44 The founder of the Arabic science of metrics, al-Khalil ibn Ahmad (d. c. 175/791), did not seem to possess the the concept of syllable, but he was nevertheless able to identify what we call short and long syllable: he achieved this through an ingenious use of the peculiarities of the Arabic script in which the face of each word was a guide to the quantity of its syllable. One individual 'moving' consonant (mutaharrik) corresponded to what we call a short syllable; and two consonants, of which the first is moving and the second is 'quiescent' {sakin) corresponded to what we call a long syllable.45 This whole theory of Arabic metrics is not only known to Jabir, he reproduces it systematically and rigorously in the Ahjar, finding yet another support for his Balance of Letters doctrine. Like al-Khalil, Jabir identifies 8 rhythmic feet—significatly, he calls them \"parts of the numerical composition\" (ajzd3 al-ta^lif al-'adadi)—whose recurrence in"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"88 CHAPTER 3 definite distribution and sequence gave rise to all meters. Two of them were quinary feet (khumasiyya), and the remaining six were septenary {suba'iyya). These feet, Jabir adds, are modified by additions (ziyada) and separations (nuqsdn) to produce an unlimited number of meters.46 Jabir feels that music and metrics were evidently cognates. Small wonder, then, that in the Ahjar he speaks of both of them in the same breath—in the same passage and in the same sentence, employing for both the same terminology. In fact, music proper was the highest stage of learning, preceded only by metrics and morphology: It is not possible for anyone to learn music without first mastering the science of metrics and morphology, the science of melody and harmony, the science of versification, and the art of composing poetry ... 47 Just as there were eight rhythmic feet in metrics, there were, we read in our text, eight rhythmic modes in music too.48 And just as additions and separations (of syllables) gave rise to ever new meters, variations in the primary modes gave rise to novel modes. Clearly, it was the ordering of numbers and their combinations which created music, and the same was, indeed, true of metrics as well as of morphology. A rather strongly-worded expression to this effect is to be found in the al-Sirr al-Maknun where Jabir declares that it is simply wrong (khata3) to say that only music is a harmony of numbers—in fact much else, in particular metrics, was a manifestation of numbers and their harmony. Harmony of numbers, he writes, was to be viewed as a genus (jins): \"like 'animal,' to which a number of things belong.\"49 Among the members of this genus were the \"wonders\" (^aja^ib) of the motions of celestial bodies—these motions followed a numerical system (al-nizam al-taJllfi): \"and by this I mean a musical system.\"50 But more than that, the individual soul too was a harmony of numbers. In the al-Sirr al-Maknun Jabir defines the soul: Harmony of numbers is not the name of the soul, rather it is the definition of the soul. Definition is a predicate of a given subject.\" And on the same subject he invokes the authority of Plato: Plato believed that the soul is rational substance (jawhar <aqli) whose essential motion is governed by the harmony of numbers.'2 In fact, prosody, and the art of melody and rhythm were identical with the soul: THE CENTRAL THEME 89 Prosody and the art of melody and rhythm are the soul. This is so because these arts arise only out of the soul, and are possessed only by those who possess the soul.53 Indeed, these are the considerations which yielded our statements concerning the harmony of numbers, considerations which led to our doctrine that the natures and the degrees [of their intensity] are harmony of numbers.54 THE METAPHYSICAL SYNTHESIS The reader stands in awe of Jabir's commanding expertise in so many classical disciplines. And yet, what is equally striking, our author makes hardly any original contributions to the body of knowledge that had existed in the Arabic tradition from the earliest times. Despite his vast knowlegde, his elucidation of phonetics, morphology and syntax adds barely anything new to what the Arab grammarians had been saying, and his exposition of metrics and musical modes appear no more than a faithful reproduction of standrad traditional accounts; he breaks no novel grounds in these individual areas. Indeed, in each case he frequently invokes the authority of experts (nahwiyyun, ashab al-^arud, etc.)55 and does not conceal the fact that he is drawing upon the discoveries of others. Evidently, Jabir's originality does not lie in these fields considered in isolation. It lies, rather, in the remarkable and daring synthesis which he was able to forge, and in which all these components cohered to form an all-embracing philosophical system. To be sure, it is a philosophical system because, as we shall see, it is founded upon certain well-defined metaphysical principles. It is this foundation to which his entire thesis owed its meaning and justification. \"Some people consider me a fool,\" wrote Jabir in the Tajmtc, \"for proposing a relationship beween the letters and the natures.\" But they are, he declares, ignorant: for this relationship is founded upon something that is as firm and as indubitable as the foundation of mathematics.56 He proceeds to prove his proposition in two steps. First, he constructs a logical argument to demonstrate that language arose not out of convention or blind chance, but out of'the natural intention of the soul.' Next, he presents his grand ontological thesis: language, he tells us, is an embodiment of what is represented in the intellect, and that which is represented in the intellect is the substance, essence and reality of being."},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"90 CHAPTER 3 Thus, language signified being, and since—by virtue of Jabir's physical thesis—all naturally existing objects were reducible to the four natures, language signified the four natures. But language, like physical bodies, was ultimately reducible to primary elements—these elements were the primary units of speech represented by letters. Therefore, at the primitive level, (ideal) letters signified the natures. The ontological equivalence of letters and natures was thereby established. This is how Jabir presents his logical argument: I say: in a discourse Aristotle had said that in the world of generation and corruption man alone is endowed with the faculty of articulated speech (nutq).57 Articulated speech consists in [the ability of] discrimination and judgment (tamyiz), and discourse (kaldm) consists in the ordering of letters [huruf= phonemes]. It is through this ordering that a given language is arrived at. But is it [sc. language] due to convention (istilab), occuring by chance ('aid ma ja'a wa ittafaqa); or is it due to the natural intention of the soul (qasd tabtH nafidni)? I say: the affirmation that it [sc. language] is a coinage (wad1), a convention, or an accident (carad) is a mistake, for language is a substance (jawhar) by nature, and did not arise out of convention (biH-wad<). Indeed, it is due to the intention of the soul, and all acts of the soul are substantial ... So letters [= phonemes], which are the prime matter (hayiila) of discourse, are an invention of the soul.58 In a more structured form, the argument can be put thus: I (a) Man alone is endowed with the faculty of speech (b) Man alone possesses soul (not stated but certainly presupposed) Inferred hypothesis: Speech is an act of the soul II (a) All acts of the soul are substantial (b) Speech is an act of the soul Conclusion: Speech is substantial The same type of argument, similar both in substance and form, appears in the al-Sirr al-Maknun: To every naturally existing thing belongs some characteristic act. Then let it be known that to man in particular belong most of the acts, and the greatest of them . . . Thus necessarily, man developed and discovered the science of logic, grammar, geometry, medicine and astronomy. And even though in matters of specific details much in these sciences is false, yet, taken as a whole, these sciences are true. THE CENTRAL THEME 91 Likewise, it is undeniable that discourse (kaldm), and the composition of letters (ta'lif al-huruf) and the design of their shapes ('amal ashkdluhd) are among the works of man (mitt taHifal-insari)—except that these come to pass by nature. It is thus indubitable that discourse and the ordering of letters [= phonemes] are part of man's natural disposition (lahu tab'um ma). This is so because every naturally existing thing possesses a natural disposition (tabila), and man exists naturally.^ This completes the first step. Jabir's ontological doctrine, his second step, which also carries a familiar psychological theory of knowledge, runs roughly as follows: • First, there is being ('the thing'). Being has three aspects—substance (Cayn), essence (dhat), and reality (haqiqa). • Second in the ontological hierarchy is the representation of being in the intellect (tasawwur bi^l-aql). The intellect performs a judgment on the representation. This judgment consists in the determination, inter alia, as to whether the object represented is real or not, and whether it is necessary or impossible, true or false. • The third place is occupied by enunciation (al-nutq), that is, vocal articulation of the representation. This is carried out by means of a knowledge of phonetic rules. • And finally, there is the written word (al-katB). This is the portrayal of the object by means of lines, and a process of bringing the enunciated word from potentiality into actuality.60 In Jabir's own words: You ought to know that geometry, logic, music, arithmetic, the Art [= alchemy], the science of [artificial] generation [of living beings], and the science of all higher and lower bodies are not merely meanings (ma'dni).^ Rather, they are meanings subsisting in the soul, and meanings that are enunciated. This we have already explained in the book of logic called Peri Hermeneias (Bdrir Minyas).62 All things are considered under four aspects. First, their substances (aydn), essences (dhwdt), and realities (haqd'iq). For example, [the nature] hot in its essence, or [the nature] cold in its essence, independent of their existence in relation to us. Then, the representation of things in the intellect, and [the judgment] as to whether they are real or not—such as affirmation or negation [of the existence of the object in question], and the declaration true or false. Next, their enunciation (al-nutq biha), and the knowledge of. . . (?)6^ the quiescent letters, hamza bearing letters, mobile letters, linking letters, and others. Finally, putting them in writing (al-katb biha). This is a portrayal by means of lines (tamthil al-khutut), and [a process of] bringing it [sc. the enunciated word] from potentiality into actuality.64 There is no disagreement between philosophers, says Jabir, that each existing thing reflects the nature of a higher thing from which it"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"92 CHAPTER 3 derives.65 And this was true also of the ontological chain: being (substance, essence, reality) —> representation in the intellect —> enunciation —> written word. The idea finds a lucid expression in the Kitab al-Khamsin: What is in writing signifies that which is in enunciation (dalla 'aid ma and that which is in enunciation signifies what is in the intellect (ma fiH-fikr), and what is in the intellect signifies the quiddity of things (mdhiyat al-ashydJ).66 APPLICATION OF THE BALANCE OF LETTERS Jabir is interested in philosophical issues only insofar as they serve his practical ends. His metaphysical excursions must now yield concrete results. Thus, after constructing a speculative framework, he proceeds to apply theory to practice. But this process of the application of Mtzdn al-Huruf would give rise to its own tensions and challenges, bringing into focus the gaps and weaknesses of his system. He is going to tackle them with a great deal of ingenuity, but often by means of ad-hoc strategems. Yet, at the same time, we shall see him making some powerful and rich theoretical generalizations which are suggested soley by practical considerations. To measure the quantities of the four natures in a given substance, one needed to analyze morphologically the name of the substance. As we have seen, while Jabir had accepted Galen's classification of each quality in a body into four degrees of intensity, he had subdivided each degree into 7 subdivisions.67 This gave a total of 7 x 4 = 28 positions: it so happens that the letters of the Arabic alphabet are also 28 in number! Thus in the Ahjar he constructs a table in which the letters are arranged according to the ABJAD scheme68 with each letter representing one of the four natures—for example, alif = heat, ba* = cold, jim = dry, dal-moist; ha' = heat, waw = cold, zd~' = dry, ha* = moist, etc. Similarly, the table specifies the subdivision of the degree to which each letter corresponds. Finally, the table—which, curiously, our author attributes to Socrates—assigns to each letter four different weights, according to whether the letter represents the first degree of intensity, the second degree, the third, or the fourth. This was to be determined by the place of the letter in the name being analyzed: if a letter, say alif, is the first radical (such as in usrub), it signified the first degree of intensity; if it is THE CENTRAL THEME 93 the second radical (such as in kajur), it signified the second degree; and so on. Since each letter was to be reckoned in four different ways, the table yielded a grand total of 28 x 4 = 112 positions. But what is most important, this scheme of numerical classification of letters followed the proportion 1:3:5: 8—indeed, as we read in our text, everything in the world was governed by the number 17 (= 1 + 3 + 5 + 8):6' 1st Ilnd Illrd IVth Hot Cold Dry Moist Deg.

Thus, to reveal the quantitative and qualitative structure of, say, lead, one proceeded in the following way: The word that named lead was USRUB—this was free of any additions or variations, and already existed in its primary form, therfore no 'stripping away' (ittirah) was needed. Now, this name had four consonantal elements—alif sin, ra3, and bd~>, in that order. The first letter alif signified a nature in the first degree of intensity: from the table, one discovered that this nature was hot and its weight was 7 danaqs [dan.]; by the same rule, the second letter sin signfied dry in the second degree whose weight in the table was given as 6 dan. Likewise, ra3 corresponded to moist in third degree with a weight of 7Vi dan.-, and, finally, baJ was cold in the fourth degree, weighing 56 dan. Lead therefore was constituted out of 7 dan. of hot, 6 dan. of dry, 7Vi dan. of moist, and 56 dan. of cold. But immediately, Jabir recognizes a fatal flaw in his system: the natures of lead as revealed by the the analysis of its name are not arranged in the proportion 1:3:5:8 — this was a cardinal violation of the \"Supreme Principle\" of Balance and threatened his whole philosophical edifice.70 There were other problems too, though of a relatively minor"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"94 CHAPTER 3 magnitude—for example, the question of homonyms and synonyms had be addressed, a method had to be developed for the analysis of those names which did not have exactly four consonantal radicals; and, of course, there was this nagging question of the plurality of languages! To cope with the most serious problem, Jabir proposes in the Ahjar what clearly seems to be an ad-hoc hypothesis. The analysis of names (hija3) only revealed the external or manifest (zdhir) nature of a thing. But there was in all things also a complementary inner or latent (batin) nature—and this was a matter of intuition (hods). This meant that to find out the qualitative/quantitative structure of a given body, one needed to take three steps: the first step was to reduce the name of the body to its primitive elements; the rules for carrying this out were already given. The second step involved the use of the 'Socratic' table through which one discovered the natures contained in the body and their weights—now the external nature of the body was fully determined. Finally, the third step consisted in the uncovering of the latent complement of the external nature of the body—this was an intuitive exercise whose aim was to make the natures of the body conform to the proportion 1:3:5:8, represented by the number 17. In our text, Jabir calls this third step \"completion to 17\"71 In more specific terms, if the second step yielded a result that fell short of 17, one made additions (ziyada); but if the result happened to be in excess of 17 or its multiple, one supressed the excess (ittirah). We find a large number of concrete examples worked out by the author to illustrate this 3-step method. For instance, he takes silver (Jidda) and shows how one determines its complete nature (manifest + latent):72 • The primitive elements of the name Jidda were F D (the second D was a repetition and was therefore to be 'thrown away'; the ta mar but a was feminine designation and was likewise to be discarded). • F was the first letter and therefore represented the first degree of intensity. From the table one discovered that it corresponds to the nature hot with the weight of 1 Vi dan. D was 1 Vi dan. in the second degree of cold. • Finally, noting that the weights fell short of 17, one determined the complements to discover the complete qualitative/quantitative structure of silver, and the result was the following: THE CENTRAL THEME 95 Nature Analysis Intuition Total (Manifest) (Latent) Hot F= 1 Vi dan. 5Vi dan. 1 dan. Cold D = \\Vi dan. 314 dirhams 3'/2 dir. (= 3x7= 21 dan.) Moist — 534 dir. 5% dir. (= 5x7= 35 dan.) Dry — 9% dir. 9% dir. (= 8x7= 56 dan.) Now, as we note, the four natures are in the proportion 1 : 3 : 5 : 8, and the final result does, indeed, conform to the number 17, for 7 + 21 + 35 + 56 = 119 = 17x 7. Having saved his theory, Jabir repeatedly emphasizes the importance of this number, not only in the Ahjar, but throughout the Books of Balances. Thus, for example, the number 17 is equated to form (surd): \"the form of all things is 17. \"73 Similarly, it is affirmed that all minerals (ahjat-) had 17 powers.74 In fact, the entire method of Balance was an attempt to discover how the number 17 determines the qualitative and quantitative structure of all things. But if the structure of all things was governed by the same number, then, ultimately, all things were structurally identical. Indeed, this is a consequence which is not only recognized by Jabir, he develops into a universal law of nature. All bodies which exist in their normal state, he writes in the Ahjar, are in the state of equilibrium, and they are in equilibrium because their constituent natures exist according to the number 17. If the equilibrium of a body is lost (or, in other words, its natures do not conform to 17), it will explode, losing the structure that makes it what it is. Stones whose natures reach beyond 17, or fall short of it, do not retain their natural state—they disintegrate and pulverize (la kharaja mutafattitari). And this is the universal Canon of Equilibrium (Qanun iPl-lHidal).75 A drastic corollary of this doctrine of structural identity of natural objects is that it abrogates the traditional hierarchy of bodies: gold is no more in equilibrium (a^dal) than, say, copper; the fruit of a tree is no more in equilibrium than its leaf; the body of animals is just as much in equilibrium as that of man. In our tex Jabir forcefully declares that \"each body belonging to the three kingdoms of nature as long as it remains in its normal state is in equilibrium. This is also true of its parts: the parts of an animal body, for example, have their own proper constitution possessing their own equilibrium. Once the fundamental equilibrium of a body is established, there is no reason to attribute to one body more equilibrium than another. Gold is no more in equilibrium than any other"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"96 CHAPTER 3 metal and it is distinguished only by its utility.\"76 This is a daring statement on the part of an alchemist. The idea of the latent and manifest nature of things, which is suggested solely by practical considerations, is now developed into a fully-blown alchemical theory. We are told that all bodies in the world have an inner nature and an outer nature, and when these are combined one finds out that the four natures in every natural object are governed by the number 17. Every metal, writes Jabir in the SabHn, contains within itself another metal of opposite constitution. For example, lead is cold and dry externally . . . but hot and moist internally . . . And as for gold, it is hoc and moist externally, but internally it is cold and dry.77 Again, this had some far-reaching consequences, for, by virtue of what we just read, the metal we call lead was only manifesdy lead: latent in it was the precious metal gold. Indeed, this was so— lead is latently gold, and tin (qala'-i) is latendy silver.78 Similarly, in the Ahjar our author says that lead only manifests itself to us as a base metal. In it lies gold which is hidden from people. But if what is hidden is extracted out, lead will turn into gold.79 Indeed, the task of the alchemist in carrying out transmutation is nothing but making manifest what is latent. In keeping with his view that the four natures were real material constituent of natural objects, Jabir even specifies the location of the two complementary sets of natures in physical objects—thus, in the Tajmtc he tells us that external natures existed at the periphery (muhit) of the body, and internal natures were located in the inside (batin), that is, at the center.80 The classical idea of 'red' and 'white' metals is also smoothly and ingeniously incorported into this alchemical theory. Thus, gold, tin and copper were red metals in whose external nature hot and dry were preponderant; in contrast, the metals iron, silver and lead were white with an external preponderance of cold and moist.81 So we see that in the process of tackling a dangerous problem with his system, Jabir adds several interesting and rich ideas to his theoretical repertoire. As for the minor problem of the analysis of those names which do not have precisely four letters in their primitive form, his method of intuition has already solved it partially. If the number of letters in a primitive name was less than four (Jidda —> FD was a case in point), the gap was to be filled by finding complements through THE CENTRAL THEME 97 intuition. But if the number of letters exceeded four, then, we are taught, these letters must be divided into four groups. Our text carries a number of examples to illustrate this method.82 The question of homonyms and synonyms is addressed by Jabir on the grounds of the natural origin of language. In the Ahjar he declares that two different names never designate the same thing, nor do two different things have the same name or the same definition.83 In some treatises we see him painstakingly involved in etymologies in order to justify his views.84 Our text carries a discussion on what is regarded as different appellations applied to the same metal, tin: qala % rasas, zdwtis and mushtari. The author, invoking the authority of Socrates, decides in favor of zdwus as being the correct name of the substance in question.85 The others were not synonyms, but names of other things. Jabir feels that many colloquial forms have obscured the original core of words, and language needs to be purified. We see his Balinas saying in the Ahjar that one ought to consider not colloquial names (Hnd al-mudhakara) but names which are established from the point of view of the application of Balance (Hnd al-'-amat), that is, names purged of corruptions.86 And although this sage is quoted in the text as saying that the practitioner of Balance need consider no language except Arabic,87 in general Jabir seems to hold the opinion that any language when sufficiently purified will yield the same results as the data of his own language. Perhaps this is why the question of plurality of languages does not seem to trouble him. In fact, his Balinas even talks about the possibility of developing an unambiguous artificial language!88"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"98 CHAPTER 3 NOTES ' In the Kitdb al-Khamstn (Fifty Books, Kr 1825-1874) Jabir compares his Balance with the First Cause: \"Physical objects are governed, by the Balance, spiritual objects by the First Cause\" (MS Shahid cAli Pasha 1277, f. 137b, qu.

Thus, the muctazili cAbd al-Jabbar (d. 415/1025) writes in a cosmological context that his predecessor al-Nazzam used to discussed the daqiq of kaldm with Hisham ibn al-Hakam (see Qadi cAbd al-Jabbar's Fadl al-lHizdl, Sayyid ed. [1974], p. 254). The term latif occurs in al-Khayyat's Kitdb al-lntisar(Nader ed. [1957], p. 14-15). ^ Bahth, MS Jarullah 1721, f. 110a, qu. Kraus, op. cit., p. 223, n. 7. See Arabic text in the addenda below. 10 The account which follows integrates material from a large number of Jabirian treatises other than the Ahjar itself. However, this is not so much of a statement of virtue as it is one of necessity, for the Ahjar seems to have been the subject of a ruthless application of Jabir's Principle of tabdid al-Hlm. Thus, it is practically impossible to make sense of this text as it stands: like so many other treatises of the corpus, it remains a 'fragmentary' work in which the truth was only partially revealed (for a discussion of the Principle see Chapter 1 above). To understand the Ahjar one has to do what the 8th/ 14th century alchemist al-Jildaki did, that is, to gather all the 'fragments' in order to complete the picture—Jildaki says in his Kitdb al-Misbdh Ji '•Ilm al-Miftah that in thirst of knowledge he travelled far and wide, visiting Byzantium, North Africa, Egypt, Iraq and Syria to collect more than one thousand books by Jabir (MS Paris 2165, f. 144a, qu. Kraus [1942-3], I, p. XXII, n. 6). THE CENTRAL THEME 99 11 MS Paris 5099, f. 144a. See Arabic text in the addenda below. It is interesting to note here a significant difference between the views of Jabir and those of the Ikhwan al-Safa'. Thus, in the very beginning of their Rasa'il, the Ikhwan express the Pythagorean lore: one studies the properties of existing things through the study of the individual numbers corresponding to these things. The very first Risdla of the Brethren is \"On Numbers\" reflecting their stated belief that arithmetic was the first stage on the way to wisdom; in their preface they say that \"the forms of numbers in individual souls corresponds to the forms of existing things in prime matter (hayuld)\" (Zirildi ed. [1928], I, p. 1)—in other words, existing things are in accordance with the nature of numbers. But Jabir accords no such status to numbers. In fact, as we shall see, numbers do not even figure in his ontology. On the other hand, and in contrast, he believes that the structure of language corresponds to the structure of existing things. And while language did follow the rules of numbers, it was not ontologically identical with numbers. 12 The relationship between things and names which designate these things is one of the earliest and most highly developed questions discussed and debated by Muslim thinkers. al-Suyuti in his al-Muzhir gives an extensive account of these discussions in some of the disciplines which had been cultivated prior to the full scale reception in Islam of Greek philosophy and logic, namely the disciplines of kaldm, the principles of jurisprudence (usul al-fiqh), and philology (lugha) (see al-Mawla ed. [1949], I, p. 7 ff.). An examination of the relationship between utterance (lajz) and the objects of the world had led the early thinkers to an inquiry into the relation between nature and convention or law. \"This inquiry,\" to quote Mahdi, \"occupies the center of stage in the discussions of language in classical Islamic thought as it had done earlier in classical Greek thought\" (Mahdi, \"Language and Logic in Classical Islam\" in von Grunebaum ed. [1970], p. 52). As we shall presently see, Jabir too is led to the same inquiry, and, in arguing for his views, he leans heavily on the question as to whether language is natural or conventional. 13 Tasrif, Kraus ed. [1935], 392:9. See Arabic text in the addenda below. 14 Hdsil, MS Paris 5099, f. 96a. See Arabic text in the addenda below. 15 But if this is the case, how can Jabir justify his claim that individual natures can be isolated through alchemical procedures? Further: how can he, without contradicting himself, hold that each nature, as well as substance, has a weight? (For these views of Jabir see Chapter 2 above). But it seems that one can in principle exonerate him of holding contradictory views. In the natural world, Jabir had taught us, the four natures do not exist freely in isolation from one another: the adept could isolate them, but he could not weigh an isolated nature. Nowhere, in describing the characteristics of an"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"100 CHAPTER 3 alchemically extracted nature, does Jabir say anything about its weight. The point is that while both substance and individual natures do possess weights, these weights cannot be known to us unless they appear in combination. Of course, here we have a theory that cannot be refuted. 16 Arab grammarians designate vowels by the term harakat (motions), whence a consonat that is followed by a vowel is said to be mutaharrik (moving, = Jabir's harfal-nutq), and that which has no following vowel is called sakin (quiescent, or at rest, = Jabir's harfal-istrahd). Hence the symbol which denotes vowellessness, jazm, is called sukun. Our author makes his second element 'at rest' to indicate the apocopate form. (See Wright [1862], II, p. 255). 17 Hdsil, f. 95 b.

The use of the term \"tasrif\" in a physical sense is also found in Shahrastani's MilaL Expounding the cosmological doctrines of the Sabians, he writes that they considered spiritual substances (al-ruhaniyyat) to be those which had the power (quwwa) to \"transform bodies and transmute physical masses\" (tasrifal-ajsam wa taqlib al-ajrdm) (Badran ed. [1955], II, 703:17-18). Also, spiritual substances were to the Sabians those which \"act freely upon bodies, tranforming them and transmuting them\" (tutasarrifu fi^l-ajsam tasrifan wa taqliban) (Ibid., 703:5-6). 20 Tasrif MS Paris 5099, f. 140b.

As a matter of fact, he is even aware of the classical disagreements between the traditional grammarians (ahI al-lugba) and the champions of what was the new Greek logic, a disagreement that found in later centuries its most instructive expression in the celebrated debate between the philologist and mutakallim al-Sirafi, and a protagonist of the new philosophic school Matta ibn Yunus. (This debate, which took place in 320/932, has been analyzed by Mahdi, op. cit. Mahdi's account is based on the report of Abu Hayyan al-Tawhidi whose al-Imtac wa H-Mu 'dnasa preserves the text of the debate). Significantly, Jabir does not use the later appellation mantiqiyyun for the members of the new school. He calls them \"people of substantial discourse\" (ahI al-kaldm al-jawhart). According to the grammarians, writes Jabir in the Ikhraj, \"ordered letters (al-huruf al-manziima) denote ism (noun), ficl (verb) and harf (particle). In contrast, the people of substantial discourse . . . believe that by convention THE CENTRAL THEME 101 (istilah) ordered letters denote three categories: either an ism (Gr. onoma) or a kalima (verb, Gr. rhema), or a qawl (statement/proposition, Gr. logos)\" (Kraus ed. [1935], 9:10-13). As for his own views, Jabir is a supporter of the latter. A noun and a verb, or two nouns, he says, are sufficient to form a true or a false proposition: \"The qawl is formed either out of a participation of a noun with a verb, or of a noun with a noun\" (ibid, 10:9-10). The particle was not an integral part of a qawl—the conjunction (ribdt) links one noun with another, and the preposition (sila) determines the relationship between a noun and a verb (ibid, 9:14-17). 26 al-Sirr al-Maknun, MS Paris 5099, f. 54a. See Arabic text in the addenda below. 27 Kraus ed. [1935], 109:4-5- See Arabic text in the addenda below. Here once again Jabir seems to differ fundamentally from the Ikhwan al-SafaJ. He repeatedly expresses his belief that the 28 letters of the Arabic alphabet, or the '28 signs that designate the sounds,' are a matter of convention and do not have the force of natural law. Thus, like Abu Bakr ibn Zakariyya al-RazI in his Hawi (see Kraus [1942-3], II, p245, n. 3) and Blruni in his Kitab al-Saydala (See Meyerhof [1932], p. 14), Jabir criticizes the Arabic script for its ambiguities and suggests radical reforms. In contrast, the Ikhwan teach that the codification of the Arabic script is definitive (Rasd'il, Zirikli ed. [1928], III, p. 151 ff.), and its inventor (wadi') was divinely inspired (Ibid., Ill, p. 357, where one reads the phrase bikmat al-Bdri3). The Arabic alphabet, they believe, can be reduced to eternal geometric figures (Ibid., I, p. 28). 28 Hudud Kraus ed. [1935], 109:6. See Arabic text in the addenda below. 29 Ikhraj, ibid., 15:5.

Jabir does not say that morphology is a branch of arithmetic, nor that it can be reduced to numbers (cf. n. 11 above). 35 This was already accomplished in the 2nd/8th century by Khalll ibn Ahmad in his Kitatb al-cAyn. 36 Edited Text, passim."},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"102 CHAPTER 3 37 See de Sacy [1831]. 38 He recognizes biliteral (thund^i) roots too, of which he gives in the Bahth 6 paradigms (Ms Jarullah 1721, f. 130b). 39 Edited text 7:6-8:3.

Kraus (op. cit., p. 256, n. 5) finds Jabir clearly contradicting himself in the Ikhraj where he says: meaning THE CENTRAL THEME 103 (ma'na) can be considered as if it were substance (kaH-jawhai), discourse (kaldm) as if it were accident (kaH-'arad)\" (Kraus ed. [1935], 8:10). But, evidendy, Jabir is not saying that language is an accident. He is presenting to the reader an analogical explanation of the relation between meanings and words which designate these meanings. 59 MS Paris 5099, f. 54a. See Arabic text in the addenda below. 60 In their general oudine, Jabir's ideas concerning the perception of external objects bear a striking similarity with those of Avicenna in his Kitab al-Nafi (Rahman ed. [1959]), and of Averroes in his compendium ofAristode's Desensu et sensato (Blumberg ed. [1972]). Evidendy Jabir's source is, likewise, the Parva Naturalia of Aristode. We note that in the Bahth the author does refer both to the De anima(Fi al-Nafi; MS Jarullah 1721, f. 104a, qu. Kraus [1942-3], II, p. 323, n. 2), and to the De sensu et sensato (Fi^l-Hiss waH-Mahsiis; ibid., f. 31b, qu. Kraus, p. 323, n. 5). 61 The translation of \" ma'ani\" 3S \"meanings\" is rather loose. Kraus equates this term with Greek pragmata (ibid., p. 258, n. 5), and it occurs both in Avicenna's Nafi and Averroes' Hiss waH-Mahsus where it seems to signify representations in the mind, or represenations in the sense. \"The object of sense perception,\" writes Avicenna, \"is form, and that of imagination (wahm) is ma'na\" (op. cit., p. 167). Averroes says, \"The ma'na in memory is not the ma'na in imagination (takhayyul)\" (op. cit., p. 38). In the Ikhraj, as we saw, Jabir explains his \"ma'na\"by stating its relationship with discourse (kaldrri) (see n. 58 above). Cf. Farabi, Ihsd* al-'Ulum, Palencia ed. [1932], p. 22. 62 Indeed, there is in the Jabirian corpus a text with this tide, Kr 2583.

It is interesting to note the following passage in the first Risala of the Ikhwan: \"Enunciations signify meanings, meanings are the things named, and enunciations are names.\" (Zirikli ed. [1928], I, p. 24). 67 See Chapter 2 above. 68 ABJAD is the first of the eight mnemotechnical terms into which the 28 letters of the Arabic alphabet are traditionally divided, and each of them given an integral numerical value. In the Islamic East, these numerical values followed the series 1 to 9, 10 to 90, 100 to 900, and 1000. Significandy, Jabir does not assign"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"104 CHAPTER 3 to the letters these numerical values as, for example, the Ikhwan do (see Zirikll ed. [1928], I, pp. 23-48). 69 In a strict sense, the table that follows is an adaptation of Jabir's table (see Edited Text, 18-19). This is so because: (i) Jabir does not use Indian numerals, all his numbers are expressed in words; (ii) he expresses his weights in three diferent units—qirat, danaq, and dirham. In our table all weights are specified in the same unit (see the system of units below); and (iii) since each letter was to be reckoned four times, Jabir divides his table into four separate sections. This method is somewhat clumsy and has not been reproduced in our table. All the weights in this table are expressed in danaqs according to the following system used by Jabir: 1 habba = 116 cashirs 5 '•ashirs = 1 qirat 2 qirats = 1 danaq 6 danaqs = 1 dirham (It should be noted that the relative values of different units of weights have not remained uniform in the Arabic tradition. An instructive manifestation of this problem is to be found in the differences that exist between the conversion tables given by modern scholars—thus, for example, Siggel's conversion table in his [1958], p. 223, does not agree with that of Lory in the latter's [1983], p. 86.) 70 The question as to why this proportion and the sum of its elements 17 is so fundamentally important to Jabir has remained a matter of speculation and search among modern scholars. For a detailed discussion see Commentary in Chapter 5 below. 71 MS Paris 5099, f. 59a. 72 Edited Text, 6:2-4. (The actual calculation is to be found on f. 78a of MS Paris 5099). 73 Edited Text, 13:3. 74 Edited Text, 20:3-4. 75 Edited Text, 38:11. A similar idea of equilibrium is found in other Jabirian texts too (see, for example, al-Mawdzin al-Saghir, Berthelot ed. [1893], III, 115:2-6). 76 This is Kraus' paraphrase of the section of the Ahjar dealing with the concept of equilibrium (Kraus [1942-3], II, p. 233, n. 2). Cf.

However, Kraus suspected that Jabir's scheme is governed by musical considerations (see Kraus [1942-3], p. 256, n. 2). 83 MS Paris 5099, f. 59b; see also Edited Text, 24:10-11. 84 In the LXX Books (MS Jarullah 1554, f. 211b), for example, Jabir gives the etymology of the words kibrit (sulphur), zibaq (mercury) and zarnikh (arsenic). In the Hdsil he has a list of the names of metals in several different languages including Greek and Persian (Kraus ed. [1935], 535:11-537:15). 85 Edited Text, 25:13-26:7.

It is one of the larger texts of this group of treatises, having been divided by the author into four parts of more or less equal length (al-Juz* al-Awwal/al-Thani/al-Thdlith /al-Rdbic). As for the collection itself, Kraus was able to restitute 79 of its titles, out of which 44 are extant (see Kraus [1942-3], I, pp. 75-99). Ibn al-Nadim mentions only four tides of this collection. MANUSCRIPTS (1) MS Paris, Biblioth£que Nationale, Arabe 5099, f. 56b - f. 62b; f. 72b - f. 86b. Copied in a clear naskh style (see Illustration I below), the manucript is dated 1023 Hijra =1614 A.D. The date appears on f. 62b. Kraus points out that some three folios of this manuscript (f. 87b -f. 89a) containing a small fragment of al-Juz3 al-Rdbic (The Fourth Part) are reproduced on pp. 188-190 of the Cairo al-Khanji codex where it appears under the erroneous title al-Sirr al-Maknun (Kraus, op. cit., p. 80). (2) MS Teheran, Danishgah 491, f. 85b - f. 121b. According to Sezgin ([GAS], IV, p. 253), this is an llth/17th century manucript (see Illustration II below). (Note: Sezgin had reported (loc. cit.) that another independent manuscript of the Ahjar exists in Teheran, namely MS Malik 6206. But the microfilm of this document received from Malik revealed that it is identical with MS Danishgah 491. The two manuscripts differ only in foliation which has been inscribed by a modern hand in both cases). (3) MS Cairo, Talcat Klmya3 218, f. la - f. 25b. Does not contain al-Juz5 al-Awwal (The First Part) of the text. Ill"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"112 CHAPTER 4 Judged by the style of the scribe's hand (dtivani variation of nasta'-liq), this manucript seems also to belong to the 11 th/17th century (see Illustration III below). STUDIES/EDITIONS As a treatise in its own right, the Ahjar has never been studied before. In fact, strictly speaking, there is no critical edition of this text either. Indeed, in his familiar selection of Jabirian treadses, Kraus had included a large part of the Ahjar (Kraus ed. [1935], pp. 126-205), but in no way did he intend, or pretend, to offer a critical edition of this work. Rather, Kraus' primary aim was to collect a large number of texts in a short volume so that the reader has access to a sample of the enormously wide range of Jabirian ideas. Thus, in most cases, Kraus' texts are based on a single manuscript and they appear with minimal critical apparatus. Moreover, when it comes to making choices from within a given treadse, Kraus sometimes seems to operate without a clear principle of selecdon. But given his limited aim, this is understandable. In the case of the Ahjar, Kraus had based his text solely on MS Paris 5099. He included in his volume the entire al-Juz3 al-Awwal and al-Juz3 al-Thani (The Second Part), and a selection from al-Juz3 al-Rdbic. The text's al-Juz3 al-Thalith (The Third Part) was excluded totally (inciden-tally, it is this part in which I discovered a hitherto unknown translation of the eighth discourse of Aristotle's Categoriae). Thus, to be sure, Kraus has provided us a substantial selection of the Ahjar, but what he did not give us is a critical edition. Also, somewhat surprisingly, his text repro-duces some of the obvious corruptions of the Paris manuscript: thus, for example, certain errors of numerical calculation, errors not at all difficult to catch, have gone unnoticed by him (see Edited Text, 15:8; 15:14; see also the corresponding translation and commentary below). THE PRESENT EDITION The critical edition of the Kitab al- Ahjar which follows is based on all known manuscripts of this treatise. Indeed, it is to be ruefully acknowl-:dged that this edition too contains only a selection of the Ahjar, rather than the entire text. But this is a strict thematic selection and includes a :onsiderable portion of the work nonetheless. Thus, only those passages )f the text have been excluded which consist in (a) drastic digressions PRELIMINARY OBSERVATIONS 113 from the main theme of the work, (b) repetitions, (c) illustrative examples or applications of the principles already discussed, or (d) rhetorical flourishes. To minimize the loss of substance, a summary of the excluded sections is given in the appendices below. It is important to note also that the present edition, besides being the first critical edition of a substantial part of the Ahjar, contains much text that is\" not included in Kraus' volume. Thus, the reader will here find many sizable sections of the Ahjar which have hitherto lain dormant in manuscripts, having received no textual treatment of any kind in the history of modern scholarship."},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"114 ILLUSTRATION I MS Paris 5099 csj3?& *-i£) L^lx>-ULfc-^Li-j^L^cAA^^ l-£J> ^]A3^^/k^ity LU^-U^ ^j£U»4la>\\j 2^1-^ /^v» -Kl5 ^v-as lii? i>Jif\\>lla^>ifi CJ&AI ill J> 1 U»i# l>^r«J>i> yy ^>£^[^1 3,. *££J\\±V>&c}\\±>\\i^Ml^A'^i^ £xs^->£=zjrt> •viOl^N L-\" ^ol_5 J^c>* ti^>-> b^i> •> ^y *& ul>V'45^L?i^ ILLUSTRATION II MS Danishgah 491 •^JIPAJ ti COJ^j UX^js1 Vj i£-Yli V^AA> O V^J XXi Lg^y-u^- •£ 'jJ ii^C-lIf -^dSol?

After this follow our prayers for our lord Muhammad and his family. Peace be upon them! In several books belonging to the Books of Balances, we had promised you an account of the views of Balinas, particularly with regard to the Science of Balance. Accordingly, we now proceed at once with an exposition of those aspects of his doctrine which are in agreement [with our views] and those which are not. [2] Balinas said: \"To expound the wisdom which was dispensed to me after my exit from the cave and taking hold of the Book and the Tablet,1 I declare:2 That which belongs in common to all things is the natures. These natures arc simple not compound. And if something is common to all things, it would be absurd to suppose that it does not possess quantity\"—we have already eluci-dated [all] this in a number of books on this Art.3 He went on to say: \"The weights which are common to all animals, plants, and stones conform to the proportion of 17. And 163"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"164 CHAPTER 6 as for the elixirs, they are not like this\"—4 again, this is something which we have already explained in several books of ours. 1:12 Then Balinas determined the quantities of these weights; [these quantities are] in accordance with what we have already set forth in the Book of Morphology, namely: 1 in the First [Degree of intensity], 3 in the Second, 5 in the Third, and 8 in the Fourth. [3] 1:14 Balinas said: \"As for the effective weight [of the natures],1 I believe that its lower limit is the cashir, that is, % habba.\" By this he means that the fifth [in the First Degree of intensity] has the value of 1 cashir. Then he arrived at the necessary conclusion that 2:1 the fourth is 1 dirham [dir.], the third 60 dir., and the second 3,600 [= 602] dir.-, the minute is the product of 3,600 and 60, so that it becomes 216,000 [= 603] dir. 2:3 The grade is the product of 216,000 and 60, thus it is 12,960,000 [= 604] dir.-, and [finally], the degree is the product of 12,960,000 and 60, so that the degree in the First Degree2 [of intensity] of any nature is 777,600,000 [= 605] dir. 2:7 Likewise, [the degree in] the Second Degree [of intensity] is 2,332,800,000 [= 3 x 605] dir., the grade in the Second Degree is 38,880,000 [= 3 x 604] dir., the minute in the Second Degree is 648,000 [= 3 x 603] dir., the second in the Second Degree is 10,800 [= 3 x 602] dir., the third in the Second Degree is 180 [= 360] dir., the fourth in the Second Degree is 3 dir., and [finally], the fifth in the Second Degree is 2Vz habbas, that is, 3 [= % x 3] '•ashirs. . . 2:13 To continue: the fifth in the Third Degree is, according to the doctrine of Balinas, KA [= 5 x 3A\\ habbas, or 5 'ashirs; the fourth in this Degree is 5 [= 5 x 1] dir., the third 300 [= 5 x 60] dir., the second 18,000 [= 5 x 602] dir., and the minute 1,080,000 3:1 [= 5 x 603] dir. The grade in this [Degree] is 64,800,000 [= 5 x 604], and, following this pattern . .., the degree in third Degree is 3,888,000,000 [= 5 x 605] dir. 3:3 Similarly, the fifth in the Fourth Degree is 8 '•ashirs or 6 [= 8 x 3/4] habbas, the fourth 8 [= 8 x 1] dir., the third 480 3:5 [= 8 x 60] dir., and the second 28,800 [= 8 x 602] dir. The minute TRANSLATION 165 in the Fourth Degree is 1,728,000 [= 8 x 603] dir.-, the grade in this Degree is 103,680,000 [= 8 x 604] dir., and [finally], the degree in the Fourth Degree is 6,220,800,000 [= 8 x 605] dir. So, God protect you, certain ideas of Balinas have been suffi-ciendy elucidated. Let us now work out how, according to his views, these weights are applied to all things. [4] Balinas claimed that animals, plants and stones each possess a characteristic Balance which was created in the First Generation by God, may He be glorified and exalted. Further, he said that ani-mals have a Balance besides the First, and likewise [plants] and stones; and that the generation of this Second Balance depends on us. So know that! He also claimed that the Supreme Elixir in particular has a Balance of its own. .. . And as for theurgical works, he believed that they possess different Balances according to their characteris-tic diversity. Then, in broad oudine, Balinas specified each of these Balances which we shall thoroughly explicate in the course of these four books as we have repeatedly promised elsewhere. Also, we shall establish our objectives concerning those Balances which we have ourselves discovered. You ought to know that anyone who has not read our prior writings on the subject of Balances will derive from the present four books no benefit at all, for all these are intimately interdepen-dent. However, we now proceed with our explication as we have promised you, God the Most High willing! [5] Know, may God protect you, that after attributing a Balance to all things we have enumerated, and after having spoken of the quantitative values which we have mentioned, Balinas also made a pronoucement on the letters which is in conformity with what we have [ourselves] taught you in the Book of the Result. Next, he said: \"When two letters of identical appearance follow"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 6 each other in one word, only the first is taken into account consid-ering its type and the value characteristic of its Degree. To the second is ascribed a minimal value which does not enter into the computation made with the letters of the alphabet. An example is \" 3 5 \" or \" b b \". By God the Great, this I have already taught you in the Book ofthe Arena of the Intellect. After that, he said: \"Let us consider the Arabic language in particular. For it is obvious that the practitioner of Balance need take into account no other language.\" Then Balinas said, \"as for the First Balance of animals [etc., etc.]\"—here I need not repeat [his words], for what he said is in accordance with, and nothing other than, what I have myself set forth in the Book of Morphology} The same applies to [his assertions concerning the First Balance of] plants and stones. So we are done with it, and there is no obscurity nor doubt in it, nor do we present to you a confused account. And [yet], as always, we deliberately abrogate in one book what we say in another. The purpose is to baffle and lead into error everyone except those whom God loves and provides for! With regard to [the weights governed by] the Second Balance of animals, plants and stones, they range—as we have said in the beginning of this book—from [the maximum to the minimum, that is from] 1 'ashir in the fifth [in the First Degree], and this is the minimum value, to the [degree in the] Fourth Degree which is of the value 6,220,800,000 dir., [this being the maximum]. .. .2 [6] The reason why we are furnishing an account of stones in these [four] books, setting these books apart from all other writings, is that Balinas said, and it is the truth, that among the letters which occur in drugs and in other things belonging to the three kingdoms of nature, there are those which signify the internal [natures], but not the ones which are external; those which do the opposite, in that they signify the external [natures], but not the internal; those in which all of them [sc. internal as well as external] are found; and those which signify [not only] all that is in the thing, [but also] the excesses which need to be discarded and thrown away— just as one needs to augment and complete what is deficient....' TRANSLATION 167 Further, Balinas believed that the name of gold truly conforms to the Balance, for it signifies two natures. Nay, the correct judg-ment in this case is that the name of the gold is that which is necessitated by all [four of] its natures. . . ? Balinas continued: \"I only say that all things ought to be named according to the reality of their Balance, with a view to practical applications, not verbal usage. And, may God protect you, it be-hooves you to know that whoever in this world discovers a new language, he is a great man!\"—what Balinas is here referring to is the bringing forth of another language of which mankind in gen-eral does not know, for precise application of names is not a matter of common knowlege. Such knowledge is found but only in ex-ceedingly rare cases. In order to discover the natures by means of letters, you ought to follow what we taught you in the Book of the Elite, so that we lead you at the initial stages not into the precise determination of things, but into their nature. And this is also what we taught you in the Book of the Result, except that, for the purposes of learning, the Result is better than the Elite. This is so because the Elite is like the aroma which emanates from things, whereas the Result is like their essence: the absence of the latter is the absence of the source.3 Thus, these accounts make it known that the extraction of the mere external nature of an object is of no use—if we do this, we have practically let the thing slip away from our hands. Rather, you must, may God protect you, weigh everything whose weight you desire and attain it, away from everything else,4 in the interior of the thing, and in its exterior. As for the different ways of the removal of excesses, you need at this point what is set forth in the Book of Morphology and else-where in these [four] books, namely that you must necessarily remove from all things whose weight you desire what is added to their primitive structure, and what has entered into this structure due to reasons other than additions.5 It is known that the [word which denotes the] name of gold, (al-) DhaHaB, exists in its primi-tive form, since it is free from additions; and the spelling of the [word which names] silver, fidda, becomes FD, since the /w3 enters in it for the sake of feminine designation, and it does not admit of masculine gender. Thus, after removing the additions from the name of silver, you ought to augment it according to the need."},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 6 So know, O brother, that when you obtain only one letter, like \" 3 \" or \" b \" or whatever else you obtain, you must make the total conform to 17 , but with one proviso: you ought to separate the result obtained through the analysis of letters from that ob-tained by means of intuition. You try to work out the latter in relation to the form,6 so that the two figures form one unique figure. By my Master! I have already explained to you that which you need not augment, in it there is a third thing—but I am not happy with it unless you make in one day one thousand animals, one thousand plants, and one thousand stones.7 God is our Guide, may His blessings be upon you. Indeed, He is Generous and Kind. [7] [A] My brother! you ought to know that additions to the primitive root of a word may be in the form of prefixes, suffixes or infixes. You ought to know, further, that some of these additions are represented by inflexions, and should therefore be discarded and disregarded: for example, Z\"YDun, Z\"YDan and ZaYD'n, [which are the inflected forms of the primitive noun ZaYD\\ in the nominative, accusative and genetive cases [respectively]1; and Z\"YDan and Z\"YDun in the dual and the plural forms. So, my brother, pay no attention to this, and restore the word to its singular primitive core, such as ZaYD from ZaYiyy, and (-UM\"R from cUM\"Ray\", and so on. IB] It behooves you to know that some letters are such that if they appear at the beginning of word, they are additions to the primi-tive root, while these same letters function as radicals when they occur in the middle of the word or at its end. On the contrary, the final letter of a word may be an addition to the root, whereas this same letter, when it is medial or initial in a word, may be a radical, I mean an essential part of the primitive core. Similarly, a medial letter may be a radical, while as an initial or final letter it may either be an adjunct or a radical. TRANSLATION 169 You ought to know that there are ten letters which function as adjuncts and these are: hamza, lam, yd*, wdtu, mim, ta3, nun, sin, alif, and ha5. But, then, these letters keep changing their places of occurence and their positions in words, whence we need to estab-lish morphological paradigms which govern these changes. FCJ So, seeking assistance from God, may He be exalted and glori-fied, we proceed: The basic units of speech consist in three struc-tures, namely: triliteral, quadriliteral, and quinqueliteral. As for the triliteral, they are divided into twelve paradigms. Out of these, ten are in use; while one is the basis only for one word; and one exists only in theory, nothing is ever built on it, and it is practically non-existent. Concerning these paradigms, one of them is FACL, exemplified in fahd, and [nine others are these]: FICL, such as himl; FU'UL, such as dubur; FUCL, such as Hinq; FACAL, such as rasan; FML, such as ibil; FUCAL, such as surad; FIAL, such as qimac; FACIL, such as kabid; and FACUL, such as sabuc. So these are ten para-digms into which the triliteral structure multiplies. As for the paradigm which generates only a unique example, it is FUCIL: the insect duwaybba is called \"duHl.\" Finally, the structure on which nothing could possibly be based is FFUL. As for the quadriliteral structure, it has five morpological para-digms, namely: FA'LAL, such as '-aqrab; FU^LUL, such as burquc; FFLIL, such as zibrij; FFLAL, such as hijrac; and FFALL, such as qimatr. The quinqeliteral is divided into four paradigms, they exist in accordance with: FA'-ALLAL, such as safarjal; FACLALIL, such as jahmarish; FU^ALLAL, [such as . . . ?; and FFLALL], such as jirdahl. [D] All else is nothing but adjuncts to the primary core. As for the recognition of these additions so that everything is restored to its true structure, there are, as we have mentioned above, ten [letters which function as] adjuncts. Among these, mim and lam are"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"170 CHAPTER 6 specific to nouns: lam is accompanied by alif, and [the addition 8:6 of] these two are meant for definition, as in AL-'abd, AL-ghulam, AL-dawa3, and the like. And all nouns admit of a gender. The letter Lam is added also between alif and kafm order to specify the grammatical third person alluded to,1 although it is more appro-priate with the hamza.2 Similarly, [a third] lam is added between 8:8 the second lam and dhal in alladhi'? This is done in order that it [sc. the third ldtn\\ can carry the a-vowel, and that a distance is introduced between the vowelessness of the [second] lam and the i-vowel of the dhal. As for mim, it is added in [such nouns as] makrum and mustadrab, and in others like these. This letter is not endowed to verbs except very rarely, such as [its occurence in] the verb makhraqa. 8:ii With regard to hamza, waw, yd', ta5, nun, sin, alif, and ha', hamza is added in Ahmad, and in Afdal, [these two] being nouns; and in ahsana, and in akrama, and these two are verbs. To be sure, 8:13 our purpose is not to teach you grammar. In fact, we are showing you all this only because in [the appellations applied to] stones, plants and animals, [some have the form of a primitive noun], 8:14 others have the form of a verbal noun. Thus, we show you those letters which occur [a] as additions to [the primitive root] of verbs, as well as to [the primitive core] of nouns; or [b] as additions to nouns, but as radicals of verbs; or [c] as primary elements of nouns, but as additions to verbs. We do so in order that you apply 8:16 these rules to all things in general, God willing! 8:17 The letter ya3 is added in the word ya'-malu, and this is a noun; and in yadribu, and this is a verb. Waw is added in jawhar\"\", and this is a noun; and in hawqala, and this is a verb. The letter ta5 is added in the word tandubu, this being a noun, and in tadribu which is a verb. [Similarly], nun is added in narjis\"\", and this is a 9:2 noun; and in nadribu which is a verb. 9:3 The letter sin is added in mustadrab\"\" which is a noun; and in istadraba, and this is a verb. The letter alif 'is added in muddrib\"\" which is a noun; and in the word daraba which is a verb. [Finally], ha3 is added in qaHmat\"\", and this is for feminine designation— thus, [in the apocopate form], the word is [pronounced] qdHma. 9:5 Ha5 is added also in irmih, and this is for [phonetic] pause. So know [these rules], and apply them in dealing with all such para-digms you come across. ... TRANSLATION 171 [8] 9:7 When we say that rhythm is defined as a numerical composi-tion, then [we explain it by saying that] this composition exists by 9:8 virtue of [sequences of] motion and rest. And as for the moving and quiescent [letters] when they are composed in speech or in rhythm, the maximum number of moving letters that can cluster in a row is four—metricians exemplify it by the paradigm, FAALATUN; and the maximum number of quiscent letters that can cluster in a row is [two], represented by their paradigm FACILAN— here the letter alif and the letter nun are quiescent. 9:10 This [latter] would have been impossible were it not for the soft-ness which is in alif Such clustering of quiescent letters is inadmis-sible except in the case of soft letters, and these are three: waw, ya \\ and alif So know that!1 9:12 Since, in speech p.nd hearing, numerical composition [= rhythm] is based solely on motion and rest, the total number of metrical feet is eight: two of them are quinary, the remaing six septenary. As for the quinary, they are FACULUNand FAFLLUN. 9:14 And as for the six septenary ones, they are MAFACILUN, FA'ILATUN, MUSTAF'ILUN, MUTAFACILUN, MUFACALATUN, and MAF'-ULATUN. Then, from these, practically unlimited number of feet are generated through addi-9:16 tions and subtractions. So it is their docrine concerning the definition of rhythm, namely that it is governed by numbers, which has yielded all these elaborations. [9] 10:1 Here we need something else, for rhythm, when viewed in terms of numbers, may either be odd or even. Now, even and odd numbers are of different types: even-even, even-odd, odd-odd, or odd-even. Odd numbers are 1 and its sisters;1 even numbers are 2 10:3 and its sisters.2 The even-even number is like 8: it arises out of the pairing of 6, of 4, and of 2.3 As for the even-odd numbers, they are 10:4 [the even numbers] like 6 which is contained in [an odd number] 9; and the sisters of 6, like [the even number] 4 contained in [the 10:5 odd number] 5, and so on.'* As for the odd-odd, it is the number 1"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"172 CHAPTER 6 contained in 3, 5, 7, 9, and in numbers like these.5The odd-even numbers are the opposite of the even- odd: they are [the odd num-bers contained in even numbers], such as the numbers 7, 5, 3, and 1 which are contained in the even number 8.6 [10] 10:8 From all this arise the four musical modes,1 being the final result of all the above numerical considerations, namely: the [rhythmic] modes called the \"first heavy,\"2 the \"second heavy,\"3 the ramal4 and the hazaj} Then, from each of these, four light modes are generated, giving altogether eight [rhythmic] modes. These latter are: the \"first light heavy,\"6 the \"second light heavy,\"7 the rapid ramal? and the rapid hazaj.9 Finally, a relationship is established between each one of these and [the melodic modes 0:11 called] the asabic}° The variations in these [melodic] modes, which are produced by fingers, bear a parallel in the variations produced [in speech] by the throat, tongue, and lips: for just as these asabic give rise to motion and rest, we obtain motion and rest 0:13 in letters too.11 So they call [these combined modes]: the \"first heavy freed,\"12 the \"first heavy tightened,\"13 the \"first heavy middle,\"14 and the \"first heavy carried\"15 (while this \"carried\" is also called \"restricted,\" perhaps the two [are not quite the same but] separated by a short percussion). In this way, each of the eight [rhythmic modes] is combined with each of the four [melodic modes], and this makes a total of 32 modes. 3:16 All this is yielded by their doctrine that [music is] governed by numbers, that is, it is a composition of numbers. . . . [11] ): 17 Concerning the Balances of those bodies which are mixed together: [A] Take, for example, glass1 mixed with mercury in some propor-tion of weight known to nobody except you, and you give it to the TRANSLATION 173 11:1 practitioner of Balance. [You will find that] this expert has the capability of determiming for you precisely how much of glass the mixture contains, and how much of mercury. The same is true of mixtures of silver and gold, or of copper and silver, or mixtures of three, four, ten, or even a thousand bodies if such a thing is in practice possible. 11:4 So we say: The determination of the quantitative composition of mixed bodies is [carried out by means of] a technique which closely approximates the Balance, and it is a splendid technique! Nay, if you were to say that it serves as a demonstration of the fauldessness of this Science, I mean the Science of Balances, you 11:6 would be speaking the truth, for indeed such is the case. Now, if you wish to know this technique and become an expert of Balance yourself so that when you are given a mixture of bodies and other [solid] substances, you are able to say what substances in what quantities this mixture contains, then in the name of God— [B] ii:8 Make use of a balance constructed in the manner of the dia-grams. This balance is set up by means of three strings going upwards [to the steel beam]: attach two scales to these strings in the usual manner of balance construction, I mean by tying the 11:10 strings and doing whatever else is needed. Ensure that the middle steel carriage which contains the tongue1 is located with utmost precision at the centre of the beam, so that prior to the tying of the strings the tongue lowers in neither direction even by a single ii:li habba. Similarly, ensure that the weights of the two scales are equal, that they have equal capacity, and that the quantities of the liquids they hold are likewise equal. 11:13 Once you have accomplished all this according to the specified conditions, not much remains to be done. Suspend this balance like ordinary balances. Next, take two vessels with a small depth of the order of a single hand-measure, or less, or more, or however 11:15 much you wish. Now fill these vessels with water which has already been distilled for several days so that all its impurities and dirt have been removed, the [container] in which this water is kept should have been washed as thoroughly as one washes drinking cups.2 11:16 Having done this, get hold of an ingot of pure, clean, fine gold"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"174 CHAPTER 6 weighing 1 dirham, and an ingot of white, unadulterated, pure silver weighing also 1 dirham so that both ingots are equal in weight. Place the gold in one of the scales of the balance, and the 12:1 silver in the other. Next, immerse the scales in the above-men-tioned water until they are totally dipped and submerged. 12:3 Now, note the balance: you will find that the scale carrying the gold has lowered as compared to the one carrying the silver, and this is due to the smallness of the volume of gold and the largeness of that of silver. This [relative heaviness of gold] results from nothing but the nature dry which it contains. Finally, using coun-terpoise find out the difference of weight between them, and work 12:5 out that it is 1 xh danaqs. Note that when you mix to this weight of pure gold roughly 1 qirat or 1 danaq of silver the former will drop in weight in the ratio of habbas to qirats, since there are 12 habbas to each qirat? 12:7 So know this, for it is, by my Master, a fountainhead of the knowledge of philosophers! It is in this manner that you determine each one of any two mixed substances, or of any three, four, or five, or however many you will. 12:10 For instance, you familiarize yourself with the ratio that exits between gold and copper, silver and copper, gold and lead, silver and lead, and copper, silver, gold and lead. Likewise, you find out the ratio which exists between gold, silver and copper when they are mixed together or between silver, copper and lead. But you can do this by taking one body at a time, or two bodies at a time, or three, or however many you will. . . . [12] 12:14 We have pointed out to you in several books, if you have read them at all, that if a letter is duplicated in a word, one of them is to be dropped. [Thus], if in some drug a degree of one of the natures is found—be this degree in the First [Degree of intensity], in the Second, in the Third, or in the Fourth—there are in this drug no degrees other than this. And if this degree is in the First [Degree of 12:17 intensity], then it is the First; if it is in the Second, then it is the Second; if it is in the Third, then it is the Third; if it is in the 13:1 Fourth, then it is the Fourth. In order that you learn all this, I shall TRANSLATION 175 give you several examples of drugs so that you see it for yourself. But such a thing is not admissible in the case of units lower than the degree, I mean grades, minutes, seconds, thirds, fourths and fifths. ... [13] 13:3 The form in everything is [the number] 17. If you find in any animal, plant or stone only 5 [parts], you are left with 12. Now, in the [deficient] drug there will always be only one nature, two natures, or three, or [all] four. There is no other [possible outcome of the analysis of letters]. Now, if the drug has 13:5 only one nature, you distribute the 12 [parts] among the remain-ing three; and if it [is one of those drugs which] possess two natures, distribute the 12 [parts] among the other two. But if has three natures, compensate for the 12 [missing parts] by means of the one remaining nature, after having deduced that it serves to supply the defeciency of the other natures of the drug. So know that! . . ."},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"176 CHAPTER 6 14:1 The Second Part of the Book of Stones According to the Opinion of Balinas [14] 14:2 In the name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful Praise be to God Who chose Muhammad as Prophet and selected cAlI as his Trustee. God's blessings be upon those whom he has chosen, and upon their families. May God grant them salvation! [15] 14:4 Now we turn to our main point. Prior to this book of ours we have written numerous others on the subject of the Science of Balance, and in each one of these books we have provided a lucid and rigorous explication of the various aspects of this Science. Now, since Balinas disagreed with us in some fundamental principles as well as in some matters of detail, it would be wrong not to specify these disagreements. 14:6 [Among] the matter[s] in which he disagreed with us is the question of the effective weights [of the natures]. We mentioned these weights in the first part of this book. We also promised in several books that we shall present an account of stones, and of the forms which the natures take in the Balance, so that nothing concerning these matters remains hidden from the earnest seeker.... 14:10 We have thoroughly explicated to you those letters on which language entirely depends, specifying instances, from degrees to fifths, when these letters are excessive or deficient.1 Likewise, we have given you an account of the [effective] weights of all lettters as we have them and as Balinas has them. In addition, we have 14:13 mentioned to you that in the exact sciences, and in dealing with subtle natural processes, we stand in grave need of [a knowledge of] effective Balances as it is expounded by Balinas, and that our need for this kind of knowledge is not so great when we deal with locomotion of bodies and their decompositions.2 TRANSLATION 177 [16] 15:1 As for us, we say: Animals have a Balance to which we assign a weight of 10 dirhams in the First Degree [of intensity]. For the higher Degrees we increase this value, just as for the subdivisions of a Degree we decrease it. Next, we assign to plants a weight of 7 dirhams [in the corresponding Degree], and, again, increase it for the higher Degrees and give smaller values to the subdivisions. 15:3 c [Finally], to stones we assign a [corresponding] weight of 5 dirhams, increasing it for the higher Degrees and decreasing it for the subdivisions according to the need. This is our view and belief concerning the manifest aspects of the Art. It does not violate the principles of true judgment, like the work of Balinas. 15:6 As for Balinas, he made the governing rules identical for all three kingdoms of nature and invoked the authority of Socrates in support, saying, \"if all three kingdoms of nature arise out of the natures, then it is clear that, consequently, there is no difference betwen them with respect to Balance—these are the words of Socrates.\" So Balinas assigned a weight of 777,600,000 dirham^ to [the degree in] the First Degree [of intensity]. And since this man, I mean Balinas, needed the fifth as the [smallest] subdivision [of a Degree], he assigned to it a weight of 1 cashir.2 He then 15:10 increased this weight [for the] higher [subdivisions] till it reached where it reached. These quantities have been specified in our account of Balinas in the first part of this book. ... [17] 15:12 Now listen to what Socrates had to say! . . . He said: \"We make [the degree in] the First Degree [of intensity] 1 dirham and 1 danaq, [in] the Second Degree 3'/2 dirhams, [in] the Third 5 dirhams and 5 danaqs,1 and [in] the Fourth 9 dirhams and 2 danaqs. We make the grade in the First Degree [of intensity] Vi dirham, in the Second Degree 1 Vi dirhams, in the Third 2Yi dirhams, and in the Fourth 4 dirhams. 16:3 \"We make the minute in the First Degree [of intensity] 2Vi danaqs, in the Second Degree 1 lA dirhams, in the Third"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"178 CHAPTER 6 2 dirhams and 1 qirdt, and in the Fourth 3Vi dirham. We make the second in the First Degree 2 danaqs, in the Second 1 dirham, in the Third 1 dirham and 4 danaqs, and in the Fourth 2 dirhams and 4 danaqs. 16:8 \"We make the third in the First Degree iVi danaqs, in the Second 4'/2 danaqs, in the Third 1 !4 dirhams, and in the Fourth 2 dirhams. We make the fourth in the First Degree 1 danaq, in the Second Vi dirham, in the Third 5 danaqs, and in the Fourth 1 dirham and 2 danaqs. Finally, we make the fifth in the First Degree 1 qirdt, in the Second 1 Vi danaqs, in the Third 2Vi danaqs, and in the Fourth 4 danaqs.\" [18] 17:1 May God protect you, just look at the erudition of this man, his stature in science, and the quality of his judgments! Note, likewise, that he discarded the sexagesimal system [adopted by Balinas], and the reason for this is his view that it is only a convention to say that one degree equals 60 grades, [and one grade equals 60 min-17:3 utes, and one minute equals 60 seconds, etc]. And if we had wanted to place one or more steps higher everything that is above a given thing, or if we had wanted to place likewise everything that is below a given thing, then we would have been in no other position than to adopt the sexagesimal system.1 But the 17:5 sexagesimal system is used only because it makes calculations easy and gives rise to fewer fractions. . . . 17:6 We have already presented above an illustrative model of the weights [which follow a sexagesimal geometric progression], a model according to which all concrete cases are worked out. In this book of mine, however, I shall set forth the pattern of weights according to the doctrine of Socrates as we have reported it. Now 17.-8 if you wish to follow the doctrine of Socrates, go ahead; and if you wish to follow the ideas of Balinas, do so, for both of them are the same. But if you wish to follow our opinion, then follow us. Our opinion is different from both of them, for it is a closer approxi-mation [of the truth].

[We are presenting these illustrations] so that you learn the reality of the letters [occurring in the names] of all these bodies. So you ought to know first that all of these stones have 17 20:4 powers. Now, these stones are either red or white. If they are white, they possess hot in the First Degree [of intensity]. They possess 3 times as much cold, 5 times as much dry, and 8 times as much moist.2 20:7 It is the opposite if they are red, possessing cold in the First Degree [of intensity], with 3 times as much hot, 8 times as much dry, and 5 times as much moist. [21] 20:9 The quantitative magnitudes obtained (in the present context, these are the measured weights, I mean those which make up the total of17):"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"180 CHAPTER 6 20:10 In the First Degree [of intensity] exists either hot or cold (and these two are [signified by] the letters alif or ba^) weighing 1 dirham and 1 danaq, as we have already said at the very outset. Now, 3 times the value of the First Degree (and here we reach the Second Degree which is likewise signified by alif or ba 5) is 3'/2 21:1 dirhams. [This can be viewed] either as 3 times the value of the First Degree or as the value of the Second Degree in its own right. Thus, the total weight of the two active natures is [{1 dir. + 1 dan.} + {3'/2 dir. = 3 dir. + 3 dan.}=\\ 4 dirhams and. 4 danaqs. 21:4 The eight-times weight of dry or moist [in the Fourth Degree], being [signified by] the letters jim or dal respectively, is 9 dirhams and 2 danaqs. [This can be viewed] either as 8 times the value of the First Degree or as an independent value of the Fourth Degree itself. As for the five-times weight of dry or moist [in the Third Degree], and these are likewise [signified by] the letters jim or dal respectively, it is 5 dirhams and 5 danaqs. [Again, this can be viewed] either as 5 times the value of the First Degree or as an independent value of the Third Degree itself.. . 21:9 In this way, among all objects belonging the three kingdoms of nature, from the smallest to the largest, when these are considered according to the precise Balance, and among all the celestial bodies and among all the other wonders of the natural world, the total weight of 17 in red [bodies] is [represented by] 19 dirhams and 5 danaqs [= 17 x 7 dan.]. This is the figure arrived at according to the precise Balance as it exists in incorporeal objects, in the mate-rial objects belonging to the three kingdoms of nature, and in the higher bodies. Similar is the case with white [bodies]. It behooves you to know this! 21:13 As for the difference between the white and the red, it lies in the excess of cold and shortage of hot in the white, the case of the red being the opposite; and in the excess of dry and shortage of moist in the red, the case of the white being the opposite. So understand that! 21:16 When you desire the weight of a given thing, you ought to find out, [first], what its letters necessitate; next, work out what it adds up to. [Finally], adjust your result so that it reaches a value which is related to 17.2 TRANSLATION 181 [22] 22:2 When in a natural object the nature hot is on the opposite side of moist, then we have an instance of the color red. Had this not been the case, the dry due to its preponderence would have torn the moist apart, since [in red bodies] the quantity of dry is enor-mously greater than that of moist. Reverse is the case with the white, for if [in white bodies] dry had not been on the opposite side of cold, the moist would have overpowered the dry. The meaning of spatial opposition between the natures is that they exist in mutual proximity; but they do not stand against each other in conflict, I mean in being face-to-face. Nor [are these natures separated from each other] by distance such as that which exists between the circumference of a circle and its center. To be sure, had spatial opposition not existed between the natures (and, con-sequendy, the hot in the red had overpowered [the cold], as is inevitable, and similarly the dry had overpowered [the moist]), then the body in question would have exploded. The same is true of all things which are artificially produced. [23] 22:9 When a thing in equilibrium exists in an integral state, just as when it is not a [flowing] liquid, then among all things it necessar-ily occupies the medial position. An example of this among stones is the case of the three bodies, gold, silver, and copper, when viewed in terms of the quantities of their softness and hardness. As for the things other than stones, they are in some manner placed in equilibrium likewise. But this matter warrants further examination and research. 22:12 This is so because, [for example], the parts of all animals exist in an integral solid state, in which case being in equilibrium would mean being in an integral solid state. But if all of these parts happened to be fusible, then being in equilibrium would have meant being fusible; and if they happened to be soft, the character-ization of equilibrium would have changed likewise. Indeed, if [the"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"182 CHAPTER 6 parts of animals] happened to have attributes other than these, they would have beene considered to be in equilibrium in a similar manner. . . . Since ail parts of animals have their own proper con-stitution, in themselves they are all equally in equilibrium. 23:1 It is now abundantly clear that gold is not the most equilibrated metal: if the practitioners of the Art make it such, it is only because they derive worldly benefits out of it. Were they in a position to derive a similar benefit out of copper or lead, they would have made these latter the most equilibrated ones, and to these they would have directed their operations. So one reaches the inescapable conclusion that gold is distinguished only from the point of view of its utility. 23:4 You ought to follow what we are saying, for you might need to transform an equilibrated object into one which is [allegedly] unequilibrated. This situation can arise if we were utterly to run out of copper, while facing a glut of silver and gold, and a need for copper. If gold were to be in equilibrium and copper were to be, in comparison, unstable, then we would need to transmform the equilibrated gold into the unequilibrated copper, for this would be demanded by necessity. 23:11 But here we likewise say: The fruit of a tree is no more in equilibrium than its leaves even though the fruit yields more ben-efit than the leaves. Nay, one ought to give all things their due weight, for they interchange,1 God willing! . . . [24] 23:14 Let us now consider those matters which concern the Balance of Letters in the elixir, just as we did in the Book of the Arena of the Intellect, God willing! So we proceed, seeking support from God. 23:15 Some of our earlier discourses have already rendered it unneces-sary to define the elixir, for it is now known that the fundamental governing principle of the elixir is 17 and that it is divided into two kinds: red and white. If the elixir is red, it has a preponderance of hot and dry; if it is white, it has a preponderance of cold and moist. And, according to the opinion that is sound and free from corruption, the total effective weight of the elixir is [a multiple of TRANSLATION 183 17, namely] 19 dirhams and 5 danaqs. Indeed, all our examples signify the number 17 [even] if [in practice] we arrive at a number which is higher or lower. Thus, it behooves you to know that in all 23:20 of them [sc. in all natural objects] the governing principle is 17, for the nature hot remains hot no matter where it happens to be, and the nature cold, wherever it exists, remains cold, and the same applies to moist and dry. [25] 24:1 This is so because the appellation applied to one nature is not applied to any other. For example, the appellation \"alif\" is applied to no other letter, be it bd*, jim, or ddl. Similarly, the appellation \"bd*\"is applied to none of the the other three letters, alif, jim, or ddl; and the appellation \"jim\"is applied to none of the letters from among alif bd*, and ddl; and finally, the appellation \"ddl\" is like-wise applied to no other letter from among alif, ba*, and jim. 24:5 If you intend to make a given \"alij*\" degenerate into a bd*, or into a \"jim\"ox a \"ddl\" [pu can achieve this] provided you derive these letters from the Second Elements, namely, Fire, Air, Water, and Earth.1 Upon my life! some of these compounds undergo transmutation. All this we have meticulously explicated in the Book of Morphology; thus, the method has already been clarifed: Pursue it! God the Most High willing! [26] [A] 24:9 Let us now return to what we began to say concerning the Balance of metals. So we say, our success depending on God: You ought to know, may God protect you, that metals differ from one another, for otherwise all of them would have been one and the same thing. Indeed, it seems proper [that they are diverse]. And among these metals there are those which [in their Balance] ex-ceed 17, others which fall short of it, yet others [whose Balance] equals 17."},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"184 CHAPTER 6 24:12 If, when analyzing a thing, you find that it equals 17, don't add anything, and don't subtract anything. However, this is an exceed-ingly rare case. If you find a thing whose [Balance] is greater than 17, subtract it in proportion till it reaches 17. Propotionalized and regularized, it will correspond to that thing which is so rare as to be practically non-existent. So know that, and proceed accord-ingly! 25:i If, on the other hand, you find a thing which in its Balance falls short of 17, complete it so that it becomes like that rare thing which is, as we said, practically non-existent. Proceed in this man-ner, for this is the way! God willing. . . . 25:4 So, God protect you, [in practice] everything either exceeds [17] or falls short [of it]—this is inevitable. Thus, one obtains the result that gold is among the excessive ones. Indeed, it behooves you to know the meaning of excessive and deficient, even though we have so far spoken of that which [is neither excessive nor deficient, namely that which] precisely conforms to 17; and, God protect you, such can only be the case of the elixir. ... [B] 25:7 So when a seeker desires to transform gold into elixir, he re-duces [the weight of] each of its natures in such a way that this gold is left only with 17, whence the total weight of the natures becomes 19 dirhams and 5 danaqs [=17x7 dan.]\\ the rest is discarded. 25:10 Similarly, if the seeker desires to transform gold so that it ac-quires the properties of copper, he finds out, first, the total weight of [the natures in] copper; then, he finds out the weight [of the natures in] gold. Next, he compares the two weights to know which one is greater. If [the weight obtained from] gold turns out to be the greater of the two, the adept reduces it till it drops to the value [obtained from] copper. If, on the other hand, copper ex-ceeds gold, he augments [the weights of the natures] in gold till it conforms to the definition of copper. However, gold necessarily exceeds copper ... I wish I knew how you will accomplish all this if you are not familiar with the Hudiid, and if you have not pondered over it!. .. TRANSLATION 185 [27] 25:14 People are seriously divided over the question of the weight of tin. Thus, some of them say, \"we determine its weight according to its name 'al-qalaH'.\" But the Stoics say, \"no, its name is, rather, 'al-rasas' since its sibling is called 'al-usrub\"No,\" say the follow-ers of Empedocles, \"we determine its weight, rather, according to the appellation 'zdwus' for its nature is most equilibrated, and that is what the word means.\" But the followers of Pythagoras say, \"its name is, in fact, 'al-mushtari'^ for it has the nature of this celestial body. We determine its weight in accordance with no appellation except'al-mushtari,' for it is al-mushtariwhich governs it, guides it, and brings it forth. Nay, this is its only name.\" As for Socrates, he judged in favor of 'zdwus! and he is close to the truth. Balinas said, \"its name is 'qasdir in which lies its weight; it has no other name.\" The Peripatetics say, \"we determine its weight according to our description 'hot and moist,' for it has no name signifying its na-» ture. 26:4 From among these differing models, none merits our choice the way'zdwus' does; and if we were to substitute for it, we would opt for the description 'hot and moist.' Thus, that which we have illustrated in the figure2 is worked out according to the name 'zdwus' for 'al-qalaH' signifies something other than the name [of the metal in question]. Indeed, the name 'qasdir is also an accu-rate one, and this is so because all [correct] names, while being different in different languages, seek to express a unique lan-guage—for what is [ultimately] sought is only the meaning of these differing names."},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"186 CHAPTER 6 27:1 The Third Part of the Book of Stones According to the Opinion of Balinas [28] 27:2 In the name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful Praise the Creator and the Raiser of the Dead, the One Who subjects to His Acts whatever He chooses.

According to the commitment we made in these two books (1 mean the first book and the second book), we shall specify in the present book, proceeding in a natural way, the forms which stones, plants and animal [substances] take upon combining with one another. Furthermore, we shall talk about the procedure for the ceration of these substances.

IA] 27:14 And if in response to an operation, some of them happen to differ from the others, [we know the reason why] for it is known TRANSLATION 187 that alif is for hot, bd* is for cold, jim is for dry, and ddl is for 28:2 moist. And, of course, the possibility remains for alif to exist in four different positions in the [name of a] compounded thing, since the Degrees [of intensity] are four. The same applies to ba*, jim and ddl. And as we taught you in the beginning, the weights of these four positions of alif have correspondingly four different values, namely: 1 dirham and 1 ddnaq [= 7 dan.], 3'A dirhams [= 21 dan], 5 dirhams and 5 danaqs [= 35 dan.}, or 7 dirhams and 2 danaqs [= 56 dan.]. .. . IB] 28:4 So turn to the stone you wish to operate upon, and [whose natures] you want to augment by means of an appropriate method of ceration. You find out its weight. If it happens to be an elixir, its weight will be [exacdy] 19 dirhams and 5 danaqs [=17x7 dan.]. But if it is something other than elixir, it will weigh either more or less, depending upon the quantity of the natures in the stone under consideration. So know that! 28:7 Augmentation, I mean ceration, is carried out in the same man-ner [in all stones]. Thus, if the stone possesses hot in the First Degree, add a fifth in the First Degree; if it possesses hot in the Second Degree, add a fifth in the Second Degree; if it possesses hot in the Third Degree, add a fifth in the Third Degree; [finally], if it possesses hot in the Fourth Degree, add a fifth in the Fourth Degree. The weight of the fifth in the First Degree is 1 qirdt [= /i dan.], in the Second Degree l'A danaqs, in the Third Degree 2lh danaqs, And in the Fourth Degree 4 danaqs. So in the case of things composed of stones only, this is what is neccesary for carrying out ceration by means of hot-augmentation. 28:14 As for the procedure of cold-augmentation, the rules for this are exacdy the same as those of hot which we have just described. The same applies to the procedures of the augmentation of moist and dry.... In other words, you find out which from among hot, cold, dry and moist is preponderant in the thing you want to operate upon. Then, you add a fifth to the most dominant nature in these stones. As we have said, a thing is not cerated except by means of [an augmentation of] its characteristically predominant nature. So know this procedure, and follow it in the operations you need to perform on drugs made out of stones only."},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"188 CHAPTER 6 [C] 29:1 Concerning the elixir made out of animal [substances] only. If you wish either to cerate it, or to transform it from one thing to another, you add a fourth to that nature which is likewise the predominant of the four. If this nature is in the First Degree [of intensity], you add a fourth in the First Degree, in which case the 29:4 weight of the fourth is 1 danaq, if the predominant nature is in the Second Degree, you add a fourth in the Second Degree; here the fourth reaches a weight of Vi dirham [= 3 dan.]-, if this nature is in the Third Degree, add a fourth in the Third Degree, the weight of the fourth here being 5 danaqs; and, finally, if this predominant nature is in the fourth degree, you add a fourth in the Fourth Degree, where the fourth attains a weight of 2 dirhams and 2 danaqs [= 8 dan.]. So know that! [D] 29:8 And if the elixir which you want to cerate or transform ... happens to be made exclusively out of plants, you find out likewise the most dominant of its four natures and add to it a third. If its most dominant nature is in the First Degree of intensity, you add a third in the First Degree, the weight of the third in this case being 29:10 IVi danaqs; if this nature is in the Second Degree, you add a third in the Second Degree; here the weight of the third is 4Vi danaqs; if this nature is in the Third Degree, you add a third in the Third Degree; and, finally, if it happens to be in the Fourth Degree, you add a third in the Fourth Degree. The weight of the third in the Third Degree is 1/4 dirhams [= 7V.2 dan.}, and in the Fourth Degree it is 2 dirhams [=12 dan.].. .. [30] [On Quality] 30:1 Quality is a certain condition of the qualified thing, I mean the condition by virtue of which the thing is qualified. Among these conditions are those which exist in actuality, such as the walking of 30:2 cAbdAllah when he is, in fact, walking. Further, among such TRANSLATION 189 actually existing conditions are either those which change or disap-pear quickly, for example standing, sitting, being in a state of embarrassment or anger, and the like—such actually existing con-30:3 ditions do not last long; or those which [are more stable and] do not change or disappear quickly, such as [the knowlege of] geom-etry, medicine, or music when [such knowledge] is actually present in an individual. 30:5 And among the conditions are those which exist in potentiality, as walking is to cAbdAllah (thus, animals are plants in potentiality, in actuality they are not, and the same applies to stones in relation to plants and animals). Similar is the case of the acquisition of [the knowledge] of geometry when it is unacquired [in actuality]. Fur-ther, potential conditions exist either [a] as a capacity in a thing, such as our saying that 'AbdAllah is [in a state of being] fallen to the ground when he has the capacity to do so; or [b] as a natural affection, such as our saying that a given stone is hard, meaning that it cannot be divided easily, or that a given piece of wood is soft, meaning that it can be broken apart without difficulty. 30:11 Things are rarely said in discourse to be qualified—I mean characterized—by those conditions which change or disappear quickly. Thus, we do not call pallid the one who turns yellow out of fright, nor swarthy the one who turns black due to a journey [in the heat of the sun]. And as for the conditions which last longer, things might be said to be qualified by them. Thus we call yellow (or, say, black) that which acquires this color as part of its natural make-up (likewise, if it acquires some other condition which is not 30:13 easily removed, [it is called accordingly]). And these, I mean the conditions which do not disappear easily, are the ones which ought necessarily to be called qualities, since the essential nature of a thing is qualified by them. 30:15 Similarly there might be in the soul either [a] easily disappear-ing conditions, such as sadness or happiness arising out of a certain specific reason and passing away quickly, or [b] longer lasting conditions, such as sadness or happiness arising out of one's innate disposition for it. Obviously the latter is identical [in appearance] to the former. However, we do not characterize as sad one who is sad for a short period of time for some reason, nor happy one who is happy briefly. Rather, we do so when these are part of someone's essential nature, whence permanent or preponderant."},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"190 CHAPTER 6 31:4 Shape, external form, straightness, curvedness, and the like are also qualities, for each one of these is said to qualify things. Thus, we might say of a thing that it is a triangle or a square, or that it is straight or curved. Rareness, denseness, roughness, smoothness and the like might be thought of as qualities; they seem however not to belong to qualities. This is so because, to be precise, a thing is dense when its parts are close together; rare when they are separated from one another; smooth because its parts lie uniformly on a straight line—none being above or below another; and rough when they are otherwise. 31:11 Qualities are possibly of other kinds too. Among these other kinds which we shall mention are [a] those which are perceived by the eye, like shapes and colors; [b] those which are perceived by the sense of smell, like perfumes;1 [c] those which are perceived by 31:13 the sense of taste, like the savour of food; [d] those which are perceived by the sense of touch, like hot or cold; [e] those which exist in the intellect, like knowledge and ignorance; [f] those which lie in the capacity of things, like the ability or inability to do 31:14 something—and these exist either actually or potentially; [g] those which are stable; [h] those which are unstable; [i] those which are active; and [j] those which are passive. 31:16 Qualified things are named after their quality. Thus in most cases things are named paronymously—such as katib from kitaba, tajir from tijdra, ja'ir from jawr, '•adilfrom W/. Yet this may not be so in all cases, either because the quality in question exists in potentiality, or due to the fact that language lacks a name for it. 32:3 There is contrariety in regard to qualification. For example, justice is contrary to injustice and whiteness to blackness, and so on. Similarly, there is contrariety in regard to qualified things. For example, just is contrary to unjust and white to black. But, [on the other hand], there is no contrary to red or yellow or such colors. Likewise, there is no contrary to triangle and circle. 32:6 Further, when one of a pair of contraries is a qualification, the other too will be a qualification. This is clear if one examines the other categories. For example, justice is contrary to injustice and justice is a qualification, then injustice too is a qualification. For none of the other categories fits injustice, neither quantity, for example, nor relation, place, time, nor any other category except qualification. TRANSLATION 191 32:10 Qualifications admit of a more and a less; for it may be said that this whiteness is more than that, or that this thing is whiter than that—not in all cases though, but in most. Thus it might be questioned whether it is permissible to call one justice more a justice than another, or one health more a health than another. 32:13 Some people say that it is not permissible, yet they say that one person has health less than another, justice less than another, and similarly with writing and other conditions. So, as for things spo-ken of in virtue of these, they unquestionably admit of a more and a less, for it may well be said that this man is more eloquent than 32:15 that, this man is more just than that, or that this man is better with regard to justice and health. 32:17 However, not all things spoken of in virtue of a quality admit of a more and a less. For example, the triangle is spoken of in virtue of the quality of triangularity, and the square in virtue of the quality of squareness; these two do not admit of a more and a less. 32:19 For one triangle does not exceed another in respect of triangularity, and one square does not possess more squareness than another. All triangles are equally said to be triangles, and the same applies to circles and squares. 33:2 Things which are equally said to be triangles [and thus] equally said to fall under the definition [of triangularity] are not called more or less with respect to that definition; the same holds for circles and squares. Conversely, when two things are not said to fall under one definition, the definition of one is not applied to the 33:4 other. In general, all things which are equally said to fall under a given definition, as well as two things which are not said to fall under one definition, such things do not admit of a more and a less. 33:6 One speaks of a more and a less only in cases where the [quality to whose] definition a thing conforms sustains increase and de-crease; for example a white thing which conforms to the definition of being white can very well be more or less with respect to whiteness. 33:8 It is in virtue of a universally defined quality only that things are said to be similar or dissimilar; for a thing is not similar to another except in virtue of its quality. For example, this triangle is not similar to that triangle except in virtue of the triangle which has already been universally defined."},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"192 CHAPTER 6 33:11 It may be said that though we only proposed to discuss qualities we have frequently mentioned relatives since we have spoken of knowledge and the like, and knowledge exists in virtue of the known. Indeed, the genera comprehending these things, I mean the universals, are spoken of in virtue of something else, such as knowledge which is spoken of in virtue of the known. But none of the individuals [of a given genus], that is, none of the particular cases [of a given universal], is spoken of in virtue of something else. For example, knowledge, [a genus], is called knowledge of something, but grammar, [a particular case], is not called grammar 33:15 of something. This is so unless the particular case is set forth as the genus, that is, given the name of the universal, which in this case is knowledge—then, grammar would be called knowledge of some-thing. Thus the particular cases are not relatives and there is noth-ing absurd in a things falling under two different genera.2 TRANSLATION 193 34:1 The Fourth Part of the Book of Stones According to the Opinion of Balinas [31] In the name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful 34:2 Praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds! May God's blessings be upon our Master Muhammad and all his family. 34:3 The one who recalls what we said in the first, second and third parts of this book would know that we have promised to explicate in this [final] part the Balances of spirits and of those substances which function as spirits. We shall accomplish this by means of illustrative figures following the pattern on which we constructed 34.5 in the second part the figures for bodies.1 We have also promised that in this part we shall spell out how one goes about augmenting what is deficient, and suppressing what is excessive.2 34:6 At this point in time we turn at once to operations involving spirits. Immediately following this, we shall familiarize ourselves with augmentation and suppression, and this will mark the end of these four books. 34:9 So we say: In fire, spirits are unlike bodies—but not with re-spect to color, hardness or casting. For all spirits, or [at least] most 34:10 of them, may have the same colors as those of bodies—red, white, black, etc.; and, in terms of casting, spirits may be similar to bodies, since all spirits undergo casting in fire the way bodies do, behaving in the same manner. Finally, in terms of hardness some spirits may function like bodies, just as in terms of softness certain 34:13 bodies may function as some spirits. We are setting forth a specific account of the spirits and the bodies, to the exclusion of others, since it behooves us to know that the Art does not exist except due to spirits and bodies; [that is to say], there is no Art except in virtue of the three kingdoms of nature since [in the real world] nothing else exists. 35:1 As for animal [substances], when distilled they yield two spirits and two bodies: the oil and the water which come out of them are spirits, whereas the tincture and the earth which they yield are bodies. . . . The same applies to plants. Concerning stones, the situation depends on whether or not they lend themselves to"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"194 CHAPTER 6 distillation. If they do, then the same applies to them too. 35:3 But if they do not lend themselves to distillation, they are divided into two types: those which vaporize, and those which do not. Those which do vaporize yield two kinds of substances: what vaporizes from them is spirit, and what is left as residue is body. 35:5 And those which do not evaporate divide likewise into two kinds: the aqueous kind, and the calcined kind. The former is spirit, the 35:6 latter body. The aqueous kind, in its turn, divides further into two kinds: the kind that flees, and the kind that does not. As for the one that flees from fire, it is spirit; and that which does not, even though it is water, is body. 35:8 So this is the complete alchemical classification of the matters relating to all natures, and this is exactly what we have already mentioned in the Book of the Complete 3 belonging to the CXII Books. [32] 35:io As for the transformation of bodies from one state into another higher or lower state, it is according to our doctrine [an inter-change between] the exterior and the interior, for in reality this is what exterior and interior are. The reason is that all the constitu-ents of all things follow a circular pattern of change. 35:11 The exterior of a body is manifest, whereas its interior is latent, and it is the latter in which lies the benefit. For example, lead in its exterior is foul-smelling lead, and it is manifest to all people. But in its interior it is gold, and this is hidden. However, if this latter is extracted out, then both the interior and the exterior of lead will become manifest. [33] 35:15 Thus there is the Balance of Fire, and the Balance of the rest of the bodies. There are Balances of the natures of stars, their dis-tances, acts and movements. There is also the Balance by means of which one knows the Sphere, just as one learns through the Bal-ance that the essential chracteristics of things arise out of the TRANSLATION 195 35:7 natures. Those who have read our book known as The End At-tained 1 and our Book of the Sun 2 are acquainted with most of these Balances, even with the Balance of the Soul and the Balance of the Intelligence, after which there is no end. And since all of these are intangible, it would not be difficult for such readers to measure the Balance of animals, plants and animals, for these exist in nature and are tangible. . . . 36:3 Chapter on the Curriculum for the Training of the Disciple [34] 36:4 [A] First you ought to understand a simple thing concerning the An. That is, you familiarize yourself with the substances which are reddened, whitened, coagulated, dissolved, softened, and dehy-drated.1 Further, you ought to know that all these processes are carried out by the method of Balance. This has been explained to you in the lucid accounts given in many books of ours: [for ex-ample], we have thoroughly explicated this already in the Result, the Book of Morphology, the Balance,2 and in a book belonging to the CXII known as the Book of Tinctures. 36:9 Then, you ought to know the First, Second, Third and the Fourth Elements, [their] accidents and their qualities.3 For ex-ample, [you ought to know that] Fire and its sisters are the Second Elements,4 durations of time are die Third, and black and yellow compounds are the Fourth Elements. 36:11 You see how your personal nature accepts all this, how you handle this, and how the results suit your natural disposition. If you already see that your mind has rejected one specific thing while you are [comfortably] handling several others, you ought first to persist in reading. You should particularly read the Commentary on the Book of the Element of Foundation, if it has reached you. But if you have already moved beyond this stage, congratulations! 36:14 Having accomplished this, move ups to the sayings of philoso-phers and their doctrines concerning the natures and their •vl"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"196 CHAPTER 6 combinations. Pick up a modicum of kalam, logic, arithmetic and geometry. To some extent this will render your conceptual grasp of 37:1 problems easy when they exercise you. But if you are already somewhat trained in these disciplines, the task will be simpler for you, and this would be a more favorable situation. 37:3 Next, depending on your choice, you handle the science of the natures, or some other discipline. If you prefer the science of the natures, you study aspects of the natures of stones and the [science of the] specific properties of things. 37:4 Then you move in a single leap to the Balances. Thus, you familiarize yourself step by step with all aspects of various kinds of Balances, such as the Balance of Fire, of music, and the Balances of metals. Some of these we have already mentioned in several books, particularly in the Book of the Elite. 37:7 And if along with the science of the natures you are inclined toward the knowledge of the craft, you study the Book of Trickeries^ so that you can be on your guard against the occurence of calami-ties, loss of wealth, and frauds. 37.9 The next step now is to become skilled in [matters presented in] the Book of the Balanced You should know in what manner and for what reason these things are combined. Now, we have already told you that by this time you ought to have become accomplished and quick-witted. 37:11 If [the disciple] does not finish my book, the Seven,7 he will remain deficient in his [knowledge of] the Balances. If, on the contrary, he is trained in it, he will be in a position to construct whatever he wishes. 37:13 All that the disciple needs now is the [skill for the] handling of alchemical operations. Restituted from accounts scattered in [a large body of alchemical] writings, these are operations such as ceration, waterings, pulverization, dissolutions, and coagulations.8 Another example is that [of the elixir] about which people have been talking since ancient times. But the ancients have wrapped in 37:15 ever deeper mysteries the method of operations relating to the Supreme Thing. Now, as we have already told you, this difficulty is overcome by nothing other than the [method of] the Balances. So know this method if you intend to achieve a close approximation [of the ideal elixir], or whatever you intend according to your desire. TRANSLATION 197 38:3 Proceed with the understanding that this is an art which de-mands special skills; nay, it is the greatest of all arts for it [con-cerns] an ideal entity which exists only in the mind.9 Thus the more one occupies oneself with prolonged studies, the quicker it will be to achieve a synthesis [of the elixir]. But the one who makes only a brief study, his achievement will be [slower] in the same proportion. Know that the fruit of the Balances are the higher operations performed on the products of syntheses and elixirs. [B] 38:7 The Balance comes about only after the mixing of bodies with bodies, spirits with bodies, metals with bodies, spirits with spirits, stones with spirits, or stones with bodies and spirits: the Balance comes about after these substances are mixed [in these specified ways]. 38:9 Even if spirits, bodies and metals are in an impure state, weigh them after they are mixed together. Familiarize yourself with all of their constituent natures and know their equilibrium. The Canon of Equilibrium is known to you—if they conform to it, they are perfect. But if they are [quantitatively] higher or lower [than 17], suppress or augment the natures accordingly whence one would obtain from them exacdy 17 pans.... [35] 38:13 People hold diverse views concerning these [sc. cosmological] issues. Among them are those who give due consideration to the Balances and proceed with the assumpdon that the principle of everything is the natures. And among them are those who say that in the natural world one thing was created before another. So, a 38:15 group of Sabians and their followers believe that some fundamen-tal building blocks of the natural world have, over others, a prior-ity in existence. But this priority, [they say], is not with regard to arrangement or organization, rather it is a temporal and qualitative 39:1 priority. Thus I have seen one of them claiming that the first thing which was created in matter is the three dimensions—length, breadth and depth—whence matter became a three-dimensional"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"198 CHAPTER 6 39:3 primitive body. Next, [according to this claim], the four quali-ties—namely, hot, cold, moist and dry—were created in it, and from this arose the natures of things and the elements of creation. Finally, [so the claim goes], the four natures mixed with one an-other to form compounds, and out of these arose all individuals and all undifferentiated forms existing in this world. 39:6 To those [holding such views] it ought to be said: You have introduced several unknowable stages [in your account of the cre-ation of the natural world]—none of them makes sense! You even go as far as to explain the existence of the world [in terms of these stages], whatever they may be. . .. [A] 39:9 So we say [to them], our success depending on God: [According to you], the first of these stages [of creation] is tina which is indestructible. [You believe that] it is not a body, nor is it predicated of anything that is predicated of a body. It is, you claim, the undifferentiated form of things and the element of created objects. The picture of this tina, [you tell us], exists [only] in the imagination, and it is impossible to visualize it as a defined entity. 39:12 You say that the second stage arrives when the three dimensions come to pass in this tina whence it becomes a body. This body, [you claim], is not predicated of any of [the four natures], hot, cold, moist and dry, nor is it predicated of any color, taste, smell, or of motion or rest. For, [according to you], all these are qualities, and at this stage qualities do not come to pass in it. Now [all] this is nonsense! 40:2 Then you claim that after this second stage the four qualities' come to pass in this body, namely the qualities hot, cold, moist and dry. From these arise the four [elementary bodies], Fire, Air, Water and Earth. But quite obviously it makes no sense to suppose 40:4 that these four natures exist in any state or condition not defined by the organization and arrangement in which they are now found 40:5 in the natural world. Thus, Earth is in the middle of the Sphere, Water is above Earth, Air above Water, and Fire above Air. Further, each of the four natures tends to overpower its contrary, with the subdued transforming into the triumphant. Plants and animals exist along with these natures, deriving from them, and transform-TRANSLATION 199 40:9 ing [back] into them. Now the afore-described stages [of creation] proferred by you are all intangible. But, as compared to what you describe, it is easier and less demanding on one's imagination to visualize that things arise but not out of a single [abstract] entity. [B] 40:11 Or [let us ask them that] they tell us if is it possible for Water to be created from the same prime matter as the one from which Fire is created. If they say yes, they lapse into inconsistencies. For a given thing which gives rise to something else is the prime matter 40:13 of the latter. As they say, the sperm of man is the prime matter of man, and the sperm of donkey the prime matter of donkey. Thus they deem it absurd to suppose that the sperm of man admits the form of a donkey, since the former is not the prime matter of the latter, just as it equally absurd to suppose that the sperm of donkey 40:14 admits the form of a man. It is therefore necessary according to this reasoning that the thing which admits the form of Fire is the prime matter of Fire, and being such it cannot possibly admit the form of Water. [C] 41-.2 If they say: We see Water undergoing transformation and thus turning into Fire. [In this process], the substance which was the carrier first of the qualities and characteristics of Water is the carrier now of the 41:4 qualities and characteristics of Fire. Thus whatever is essentially true of the former is essentially true also of the latter: it is only the accidents of the substance which have changed. Therefore, the eternal prime matter is one and the same—it is the carrier of the qualities and dispositions of Water if they come to pass in it, and those of Fire if these latter come to pass in it. 41:7 Then in reply we say: Water does not transform in a single stroke into Fire. Rather it transforms first into vapors and then becomes Air. Next, Air un-dergoes transformation and, [finally], turns into Fire. If someone says that Water transforms, first, into Air and, then, transforms into Fire, he is indeed speaking of a transformation [process]"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"200 CHAPTER 6 which makes [perfect] sense. 4i:ii Further, your doctrine concerning the simple, indestructible prime matter is not consistent with this, for you do not say that it is only by way of the afore- mentioned transmutations that Fire is created out of the thing from which, in the first instance, Water is 41:13 created. Rather you say, \"it is possible that the prime matter which is overtaken by the nature and chracteristics of Water is subse-quently overtaken instead by the natures and chracteristics of Fire.\" And, according to you, this takes place without the interme-diary of the transformations that lie between Water and Fire. This makes no sense! 42:2 They claim that prior to acquiring forms and before the occurence in it of the natures, the eternal prime matter is endowed with the potentiality only of accepting in the first instance the chracteristics and qualities of Fire. But that there is a kind of prime matter which is endowed with the potentiality only of accepting the characteristics and qualities of Water, and that the same goes for 42:4 Earth and Air. It is through this doctrine that they demonstrate the creation of the four eternally indestructible elements which possess different potentialities. But, then, this refutes their affirmation that the First Element is unique and does not admit of diversity. [D] 42:7 They are asked: \"Is it admissible that things return to the eter-nal prime matter the way they arose out of it?\" If they say, \"no, it is not admissible,\" one might ask, \"but why not?\" If they say, \"this is annihilation of things, for then things will be returning to some-thing which is simple, not admitting of combination,\" then we 42:9 respond, \"and what harm do you see in saying that things will return to that which happens to be indestructible on account of its being an eternal cause. And, further, what harm do you see in saying that while prime matter is simple and it possesses no combi-nations, it will annihilate the world?\" [E] 42:12 It [ought to be] said to them: A majority of philosophers be-lieves that the four natures, which are the fundemental principles TRANSLATION 201 of creation and are the elements of the things (I mean [the ele-ments of the primary bodies] Fire, Air, Water and Earth), poten-tially exist in one another. Thus those people lapse in inconsisten-cies who say that the four natures exist in something other than themselves, and that they exist in something other than what arises out of them. Such people declare it inconceivable that things can exist in any other way. 42:16 So if someone alleges that these four natures are only to be found existing potentially in something other than themselves, and in something other than what arises out of them, let him bring a proof of his hypothesis. [Indeed], he will never be able to do so, for it is irrational [to espouse a hypothesis] which stands in disagree-ment with this doctrine [sc. the doctrine of the philosophers] and which contravenes the organization and arrangement [of which we have spoken]! IF] 43:2 The incorrectness of their affirmation is deduced from what the philosophers consider as an indubitable premise and an item of necessary knowledge, namely: It is absurd to suppose that a sub-stance can exist without any natural or fabricated acts, so that this substance has no act either in itself or in anything else. 43:5 [Yet] this is [precisely] the nature which these people declare as eternal, claiming that it is the element of things, and that the prime matter which arises out of it is indestructible and is devoid of all natural and fabricated acts. And this is the theory which is dismissed by the philosophers who deny the exsitence of such an 43:7 entity. To support [their idea of] a substance devoid of all acts, they [sc. the upholders of this theory] have been able neither to offer a proof of what they claim, nor to establish it by an indirect demonstration. [G] 43:9 Since the case is other than all this, the natures are [to be understood] according to what we elucidated for you in all the preceding books, namely that the natures are the fundamental principle [of the real world], and that they are subject to the acts of"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"202 CHAPTER 6 the Creator, may His praise be exalted! And from this you become familiar with the method of attaining [the knowledge of] the Natural Balance, nay, you even become an expert of all com-pounds that are constituted out of the natures, able to distinguish goodness from corruption. [36] 43:13 After accomplishing all this, the disciple moves to the task of verbal and written discourse so that his skills reach perfection. If, [following this], his insight in the Art matches his insight in the Science, and if in applications he possesses a refinement of quality, he is to be called a perfect philosopher! 43:16 This ultimately brings us to an end, being the final stage re-quired in the training of the disciple whence the disciple meets our definition and description of him. At this time he is among those people who are closest to us! 44:2 Now, without delay, we shall present the figures which illustrate Balances, followed by a figure [illustrating] augmentation and sup-pression. This is the conclusion of the book, God the Most High willing!.. . CHAPTER 6 203 COMMENTARY AND TEXTUAL NOTES [1] Jabir opens his discourse in the familiar traditional manner. One notes that there is nothing particularly ShicI or specifically Ismaclll about his religious locutions here. No prayers have been offered for cAll, or for any other Imams. The most important feature of this opening section, however, is the way our author refers to Balinas. Indeed, this personage has been mentioned repeatedly throughout the Jabirian corpus (see below), but here for the first time we hear about him in connection with the Science of Balance. This is puzzling, for there is no trace of such a discipline in whatever we so far know of the writings attributed to Balinas. But we must first identify this figure. Since the researches of Silvestre de Sacy (see particularly his [1799]), it has been known that Balinas is the Arabicization of Apollonius (it exists in other forms too, such as Balinus, Abuluniyus, Afuluniyus, clusus, Abulus, etc. See Plessner, s.v. \"Balinus,\" [EI2], I, p. 994). In the Islamic tradition, two persons named Apollonius are known: the well-known mathematician Apollonius of Perge (d. c. 200 B.C.), and the 1st century A.D. Neopythagorean sage Apollonius of Tyana. While one finds in the Arabic sources considerable confusion between these two figures (Plessner, op. cit.), it is evident, as we shall presently see, that Jabir's Balinas is the latter Apollonius. There exist at least eight Arabic titles attributed to Apollonius of Tyana (for general surveys of Arabic Apollonius literature see Ruska [1926]; Plessner, op. cit.; idem, [1927]; idem, [1931]; Kraus [1942-3], II, pp. 270-303), but the most important from our point of view is the work entitled Kitab Sirr al-Khaliqa wa San'at al-Tabi'a which is now available in a critical edition (Weisser [1979]). Also known as the Kitab al-'Ilal, the Sirr seems to have had a direct influence on the ideas of Jabir (see Chapter 1 above). Now, as we have discussed in Chapter 1 above, the text in question has not been conclusively dated, but this much is certain: it has nothing to do with the historical Apollonius of Tyana; so here we must speak of a pseudo Apollonius."},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"204 CHAPTER 6 The phrase \"sirr al-khaliqa wa san'-at al-tabVa \" occurs in the Jabirian corpus more than once (for example in the LXX, Kraus ed. [1935], 481:6; al-Sirr al-Maknun, ibid., 339:1-2; al-Mlzan al-Saghir, ibid., 442:15), while in his Bahth ]ab\\.i: refers to a Sirr al-Tabica of Balinas (MS Jarullah 1721, f. 44) by which he clearly means the same work for he quotes from it a famous aphorism which is indeed to be found in the Sirr text as we know it today. And this leads us to an important feature of the Sirr. To the best of our present knowledge, this work is the ultimate source of that highly enigmatic but equally influential collection of aphorisms, the Tabula Smaragdina, which had remained much in vogue in the later Middle Ages and post Renaissance periods. It was first printed in 1541 A.D. in the anonymous De Alchemia of Nuremberg, and often soon afterwards (Ruska [1926]). The Tabula, which is the al-lawh al-zumurrud of the Sirr (Weisser ed. [1979], pp. 524-525), has been quoted in its entirety in Jabir's Ustuquss al-Uss (Holmyard ed. [1928], 90:9-16), and partially elsewhere (Hayy, Bahth). However, neither the Tabula, nor any other parts of the Sirr show any trace of Jabir's Science of Balance. Further, there is in that work no discussion about the natures being measurable and the harmony of the world resting on their quantitative relationships. Did Jabir have available to him some other work of Balinas? This is a question that needs further painstaking research. However, as a cursory remark one may point out that three works seem to be good candidates for consideration as Jabir's sources: (a) Attributed to Balinas is a treatise entitled Kitab al-Filaha (The Book of Agriculture) and it has been observed that Jabir's Khawass shows some significant dependence on this work (Sezgin, [GAS], IV, p. 163). (b) The alchemist al-Jildaki in his Sharh al-Shams al-Akbar (Commentary on the Supreme Sun) mentions a Kitab al-Sab'-a (Book of the Seven) of Balinas, on the first part of which he claims to have written a commentary (MS Berlin 4188. See Kraus [1942-3], II, p. 297, n. 4). Kraus suspected an influence of this work on Jabir's Science of Balance {ibid, pp. 297-298). (c) In the confused Arabic Balinas literature, there is also a Kitab Miftah al-Hikma (The Key to Wisdom) which has been attributed to a pupil of Apollonius, the famous Artefius. This work, discovered by Levi Delia Vida, is extant in Latin under the title Clavis sapientiae (Levi Delia COMMENTARY AND TEXTUAL NOTES 205 Vida [1938]). Sezgin suspects that Artefius may well have been the author of other works of the Balinas corpus (Sezgin, op. cit., p. 167). [2] Here we read that Balinas is in agreement with Jabir's idea that (a) all things are reducible to the four natures, (b) these natures posssess quantities, and (c) these quantities exist in all things in the proportion 1:3:5:8, thus conforming to the number 17 (= 1+3+5+8). In the preceding chapters we have already discussed the importance of 17 in the Jabirian system. As to why this particular number is chosen by our author, it is a question which has remained a subject of speculative investigation on the part of modern scholars. It puzzled Kraus, who, as Needham acknowledged, devoted to it an immensely learned disquisition in his [1942-3] (II, pp. 199-223), recalling the Timaeus and Pythagoras, looking for connections with the Music of the Spheres, and alluding to 17 consonants in the Greek alphabet (Needham [1980], V, iv, p. 462). However he did not claim to have solved the problem of Jabir's sources in this matter. In the fifties, Stapleton suggested that the mysterious Jabirian numbers can all be derived from the magic square of 3 (Stapleton [1953]; [1957]; [1958]). A magic square is an arrangement of numbers in the form of a square or some other matrix such that every column, every row, and each of the diagonals adds up to the same number. Stapleton considered the simplest case and applied to it what he called gnomic analysis to explain not only the number 17 of Jabir, but also its Jabirian elements 1, 3, 5 and 8: 4 9 2 3 5 7 8 1 6"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"206 CHAPTER 6 : Divided in this way, the gnomon's total is 28 (sum of the numbers enclosed by heavy lines, 4+9+2+7+6), while the numbers in the remaining compartments add up to 17 and have Jabir's 1, 3, 5 and 8. Stapleton traced this magic square ultimately to ancient China where, he tells us, it is found \"possibly [as early as] 1000 B.C. as the ground plan of the Ming-Tang—the Ducal (and, later, Imperial) Temple of Mystic Enlightement\" ([1953], p. 36). And further, writes Stapleton, \"this Magic Square was known in Europe to Theodorus, a pupil of . . . Porphyry.\" (p. 37). Finally, in the early eighties, Needham reopened this question, but only to reinforce Stapleton's conclusions (Needham, op. cit., pp. 461-464). Gladly recognizing what he saw as Jabir's connection with Chinese thought, Needham gave a strong support to Stapleton's generalization that there has been \"a cardinal influence [of] Chinese cosmism upon Arabic protochemistry and alchemy.\" (p. 462). The mystery of the Jabirian numbers rests at this juncture. But insofar as the question of specific sources is a fruitful one, there seems to be no reason to deny Stapleton the credit of providing a convincing historical explanation of Jabir's 17. In fact, the explanation is particularly convincing in view of the fact that the above magic square does, indeed, appear in one of the Jabirian texts: this is the Kitab al-Mawazin al-Saghir (The Small Book of Balances, Kr 980, Berthelot ed. [1893], III, p. 118). It is rather remarkable that in his painstaking effort to explain Jabir's mysterious number, Kraus made no use of this feature of the al-Mawazin! TEXTUAL NOTES I .7.38 43 w -M •M ' This is one of the several legendary accounts of the discovery of the writings attributed to Hermes. Some accounts, such as that of Abu Ma'shar (d. 273/886), have it that in order to preserve revealed wisdom Hermes had left inscriptions on the walls of temples and caves which were subsequently discovered by sages. Hermes had himself received his knowledge, so a legend goes, from a book written on sapphire tablets delivered to him by an angel. (Cf. Pingree [1968]. For a general survey of Arabic Hermetica see Plessner [1954]; Affifi [1951]; for specific accounts in the Arabic tradition see Scott [1936], IV, pp. 248-276; Massignon's \"Appendix\" to Festugi£re [1944]). 2 This entire quotation of Jabir (namely, \"To expound the wisdom ... I declare\"), comes practically verbatim from the Sirr of Balinas where one COMMENTARY AND TEXTUAL NOTES 207 reads, \"aqulu 'ala ithri kitabi hadha wa asifu H-hikmata H-lati uyidtu bihd. . .\" (Weisser ed. [1979], 1:3-4). Indeed, the legend of the cave in which Hermes revealed his Tablet to Balinas is also found in the Sirr (Weisser ed. [1979], pp. 5-7). 3 The Art = alchemy. 4 In other words, elixirs vary according to the objects to which they are applied (see below).

Thus, \"al-wazn bi al-sanja would mean the measured weight, or the effective weight. 2 It should be noted that Jabir uses the term \"degree\" in two different senses: (i) in the Galenic sense of taxeis, and (ii) as the largest subdivision of (i) which latter seems to have been borrowed from astronomy. To distinguish the two, the'd' in (i) has been capitalized, thus \"the degree in the First Degree, the degree in the Second Degree,\" etc."},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"208 CHAPTER 6 [4] It has been pointed out in the preceding chapters that Jabir believes in the artificial generation not only of plants and animals but also of human beings. His Tajmic is devoted to this very subject, a work in which he gives actual laboratory procedures for carrying out such generation. Here the author tells us about two kinds of Balances: a Balance created by God, the First Balance; and a Balance which can be created by man, the Second Balance. In the al-Mlzan al-Saghir, we read: \"There are two sorts of creation, a First, and a Second. The Second is represented by Art and resembles the First.\" (Kraus ed. [1935], 449:4). And what is the difference between divine creation and artificial generation? In the former case, Jabir explains, the natures are brought into relation with substance in one instant {daf atan wahidatari), whereas in the latter case, man is able to unite the natures with substance only in successive steps (daf-at), bit by bit, over a period of time {ibid., 444:4-6). We see Jabir reiterating his view that the artificial generation of organic and inorganic bodies is within human competence. It is interesting, however, that he attributes this belief to Balinas. [5] Given our detailed exposition of Jabir's Balance of Letters doctrine (Chapter 3 above), the contents of this section should present little difficulty (for the problem of repetition of letters in a given name, see especially \"Application of the Balance of Letters\"). We are told once again that Balinas is in agreement with our author. But it is remarkably strange that to this Neopythagorean sage Jabir attributes the view that the practitioner of Balance need take into account no language other than Arabic! Does Jabir think that Balinas is an Arab writer? An answer to this question might provide some important clues toward the identification of the pseudo literature available to our author. There are two further points of interest in this passage. Jabir's Balinas says that everything ought to be named according to the reality of its Balance. But, then, this would trap our author in a circle: for, according to him, one discovers the Balance of things by their names—now we are told that to name a thing one needs to know its Balance! COMMENTARY AND TEXTUAL NOTES 209 Jabir creates for himself another embarrassment by making his sage talk about an unambiguous artificial language. This weakens his idea that language has a natural origin and is not a matter of convention (See The Metaphysical Synthesis,\" Chapter 3 above). Finally, one notes Jabir's peculiar brand of 'esotericism making an appearance here. To baffle the unworthy reader, the author confesses, contradictions are deliberately introduced among the various parts of the corpus! TEXTUAL NOTES 1 The text 4:8-9 is somewhat ambiguous due to the author's broken style. 2 See the table in [3] above. [6] See Chapter 3 above. TEXTUAL NOTES 1 If the weights of the natures in a thing did not conform to the proportion 1:3:5:8, one had to discover it by intuition: thus, if these weights fell short, one made additions; if the weights were in excess, then, again by means of intuition, \"separations\" had to be carried out. 2 This is strange, for \"dhahab\" has only three letters: how can it signify four natures? One notes also that our author himself does not seem to agree with the view that the nature of gold \"truly conforms to the Balance,\" for a little later we are told that gold is \"excessive\" (see [26] below). 3 Note the eulogy here. 4 It is not clear what the author means by \"away from everything else.\" 5 Jabir very likely means inflections, feminine designations and plural forms. 6 Form =17 (see [13] below). 7 Indeed, through the method of artificial generation, the adept could accomplish this (see [4] above)."},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"210 CHAPTER 6 [7] Quite abruptly, all references to Balinas have been suspended. Jabir now proceeds with his explication of morphology, and, in effect, writes a brief and lucid treatise on the idea of verbal roots and primitive nouns. We are taught how to restitute a word to its primitive core—this was, we recall, the first step toward determining the quantitative structure of a thing (see \"Application of the Balance of Letters,\" Chapter 3 above). [A] Here Jabir deals with the inflection of nouns, and explains it not by stating general principles, but, rather, by giving illustrative examples. TEXTUAL NOTES 1 Jabir specifies two terms for the genitive case, khafd and jarr. This betrays a terminological eclecticism, for the former term was used by the grammarians of Baghdad, the latter by those of Kufa. [B] He moves on to an explanation of verbal roots, identifying the ten adjunct consonants which are used to form derivatives of the root. We are told, further, that these ten letters can also function as radicals—this is a standard morphological fact of the Arabic language. It is interesting to note that Jabir had manufactured his own mnemonic phrase for these consonants, namely \" al-yawm tansahu.\" This phrase appears in the Ikhraj, Kraus ed. [1935], 11:15. (For the different mnemonic expressions of the grammarians, see Silvestre de Sacy [1831], I, p. 31). [C] In discussing the three classes of roots, Jabir is concerned not with verbs but with nouns, and, given his interest in the names of things, this is understandable. He is here dealing with the different permutations of the three vowels (a, i, u) that are adjoined to the radicals and give rise to different paradigms. It is obviously due to Jabir's theoretical preoccupa-tions that he concerns himself with vowels, for in his method of analysis COMMENTARY AND TEXTUAL NOTES 211 of names, vowels play no role. Indeed, he is interested both in music and metrics, and in this way relates them to morphology. ID] Now Jabir explains how the ten adjunct consonants are added to the primitive core of a word. Here he deals with both nouns and verbs, giving a very clear account, and one finds nothing unusual about the examples given in the last paragraph (Jabir's illustrative nouns and verbs can all be found, for example, in Ibn Manzur's Lisan al-'-AraB). TEXTUAL NOTES 1 Indeed, lam is added in \"dhak\"\" so that it becomes \"dhabk?.\" 2 This is not clear. 3 The case Jabir has in mind is that of the relative pronoun for the dual, e.g., all\"dhan' (masc. nom.) and alPdlfyn' (masc. acc. and gen.)—these words are, indeed, spelt with three lams, and the same applies to the feminine forms. [8] See Chapter 3 above. (For the grammarians' idea of'motion' and 'rest,' see n. 16 of that chapter). TEXTUAL NOTES 1 For an extensive study of Arabic phonetics see Bravmann [1934]. An excellent brief account is to be found in Fleisch s.v. \"Huruf al-Hidja\\\" [EI2], III, p. 596 ff. [9] This is one of the most interesting passages in the whole text. We see an abrupt introduction of an account of different types of numbers. Note that this is somewhat of a digression for the author makes no use of these ideas in what follows. Significantly, the terms used by Jabir all come from the Greeks. Thus,"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"212 CHAPTER 6 fard = peritton; zawj = artion; zawj al-zawj = artiakis artion; fard aL-fard = perittakis peritton; zawj al-fard = perittakis artion; and fard al-zawj = artiakis peritton. All these terms appear in Euclid's Elements, Book VII (Heath tr. [1956], Def. 7-10, pp. 277-278). The standard text of Euclid does not mention the last one on the above list, but see Heath's \"Notes,\" {op. cit., p. 283) where he specifies a manuscript which does contain a definition of artiakis peritton. The same terms are found also in the other major source of Arabic science of numbers {Him al-cadad), namely the Introduction to Arithmetic of the 2nd century A.D. Greek mathematician, Nicomachus of Gerasa (D'ooge tr. [1926], Book I, especially Chapters 7-11). It is significant, however, that the formulation of Jabir's definitions is markedly different from those of Euclid, and this is the reason why I have not imitated the standard translations of Euclid's Greek terms, namely \"odd-times odd,\" \"even-times even,\" etc. Rather, the terms have been rendered \"odd-odd,\" \"even-even,\" etc., dropping the word \"times.\" As we proceed, it will become evident that the standard renderings make little sense in the Jabirian context. But one notes also that, despite the differences in the formulations of the two authors, Jabir seems to share with Euclid most of the concepts themselves. On the other hand, Jabir's account has nothing whatsoever to do either with the text or the concepts of Nicomachus' Introduction. This places him in a distinct tradition: for we know that it is the Introduction which had served as the essential source, e.g., of the \"Treatise on Numbers\" of the Ikhwan al-Safa3 {RasaHl, Zirildl ed. [1928], pp. 23-48). In fact, the \"Treatise,\" which mentions Nicomachus at the very beginning, is largely a paraphrase of the Introduction (see Goldstein's translation of the former in his [1964]). Similarly, the well-known Mafatih al-cUlum of the 4th/10th century author al-Katib al-Khwarizml also reproduces the definitions of Nicomachus (Khadevejam ed. [1968], pp. 177-179). But, evidently, Jabir does not belong to this Arabic Nicomachus tradition. If anything, he is closer to Euclid (see below). This feature of our text might throw some new light on the sticky question of the dating of the Jabirian corpus. For while the Arabic Euclid tradition is a very complex and unusually rich phenomenon (see Murdoch s.v. \"Euclid: Transmission of the Elements,\" [DSB], IV, p. 445; Busard, [1968], [1983]; De Young [1981]), it is definitively known that there are two ultimate sources of the Arabic tradition of the Elements: (i) the translation of Hajjaj ibn Yusuf, first made during the reign of COMMENTARY AND TEXTUAL NOTES 213 Harun al-Rashid (170-194/786-809); and (ii) that of Ishaq ibn Hunayn, which was revised by another famous translator Thabit ibn Qurra who died in 289/901 (Busard [1968], p. 1). Thus the first version of the Hajjaj translation happens to antedate the Ishaq-Thabit text by a period of the order of one century. Now, as we shall presently see, Jabir shows clear affinities with that Arabic Euclid tradition which incorporates some material from the older of the two texts. The Introduction of Nicomachus, however, made its first appearance only in the latter half of the 3rd/9th century when the Thabit ibn Qurra, the same personage who had revised Ishaq's rendering of the Elements, translated it into Arabic (entided Kitab Madkhal ila '•Ilm al-'-Adad, this translation has been edited by Kutsch [1958]). Given the late arrival of the Introduction, it is no surprise that Jabir's ideas are totally independent of it. TEXTUAL NOTES 1 Jabir defines odd numbers before defining even numbers. This reverses the order one finds in Euclid's Elements (Def. 7 and 8, Heath tr. [1956], II, p. 277). In fact it was a logical necessity for Euclid to define even numbers first, since he defines odd numbers in terms of even numbers. As for the rest of the definitions, Jabir follows the order of Euclid. But perhaps the most significant feature of this definition of Jabir is his use of the term \" wahid for unit, rather than \" tuahda,\" for this is one of the identifying traits of the Arabic Euclid tradition which derives from, inter alia, the Hajjaj text (see De Young, op. cit., pp. 565-567). According to De Young {loc. cit) the difference between the two terms hinges on whether the unit is considered odd or not. As we can see, Jabir does, indeed, consider the unit to be an odd number. Thus, we can legitimately place him in a pre-Ishaq-Thabit environment. 2 One would have thought that by 'sisters' Jabir means 'multiples,' but, then, he used the same word in his definition of odd numbers where it had a different sense! This definition, like his first one, is totally dissimilar to what one reads in Euclid (Heath tr., loc. cit.). 3 Euclid's definition reads: \"An even-times even number is that which is measured by an even number according to an even number.\" (Heath tr., loc. cit.). Jabir's example of 8 certainly satisfies this definition, for 8 = 2 x 4, or 4 x 2. But, then, to say that it arises also out of a pairing of 6 is to violate Euclid's definition."},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"214 CHAPTER 6 Therefore it seems that Jabir views an even-even number as that which arises when an even number pairs with itself, or with another even number. Thus, 8 = 4 + 4, 6 + 2, 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 (double pairing). Obviously this is a worthless concept, for all even numbers except 2 satisfy this definition. (It is now clear why it is not appropriate to translate Jabir's \"zawj al-zawj\" as \"even- times even,\" unlike the case with Euclid). 4 Jabir's example of 6 will certainly satisfy Euclid's Def. 9, namely, \"an even-times odd number is that which is measured by an even number according to an odd number.\" (Heath tr., p. 278). For 6 = 2x3, and (given that the unit is considered an odd number by our author) also 6x1. However, it is not clear what Jabir means when he says that \"6 is contained in 9,\" etc. 5 According to Euclid, \"an odd-times odd number is that which is measured by an odd number according to an odd number.\" (Heath tr., loc. cit). Jabir's examples all satisfy this definition, since 3=1x3 5=1x5 7=1x7 9 = 1 x 9, 3 x 3. But, assuming that our translation is accurate, what does he mean by saying that it is ' the number 1 contained in 3, 5, 7, 9, and in numbers like these?\" If he did not have 9 in his list, one would clearly see that he is talking about prime numbers. 6 Odd-even (or rather, \"odd-times even\") numbers are not mentioned in Nicomachus' Introduction (and hence not in the Rasd'il of the Ikhwan), nor are they found in all MSS of the Elements. Heath tells us (op. cit., p. 283) that in the manuscript in which such numbers are introduced, they are stated to be the ones which, when divided by an odd number, give an even number as a quotient. This would mean that any \"even-times odd\" number is also \"odd-times even\" number, since 6 = 2x3 = 3x2, making the definition superfluous. Thus Heath considers this to be an interpolation. Jabir's definition is obscure. He gives as examples 7, 5, 3 and 1: is he talking about prime numbers? COMMENTARY AND TEXTUAL NOTES 215 [10] The musical modes mentioned by Jabir are all well-known in the Arabic tradition (see Wright [1978],. pp. 250-254). We note that he uses the term Tariqa (pi. Tara^iq, Turuq, etc.) to designate both rhythmic and melodic modes known more specifically as Hqa'-dt and asabic respectively (al-Farabl [1967], p. 1022 ff.; al-Kindi [1965], p. 26, qu. Farmer [1967], p. 151; al-Mascudi [1874], VTII, pp. 98-99; al-Ghazali [1901], pp. 220-222. See notes below). Looking at this section from the perspective of the history of Arabic musical theory, one finds in it nothing to suggest a post-2nd/8th century origin of our text. For all the terms used by Jabir appear not only in the writings of the first Arab philosopher (i.e., faylasuf) al-Kindi, it is also known that already the earliest musicians of Islam, Abu Uthman ibn Misjah (d. c. 97/715) and his students, Ibn Surayj (d. c. 108/726), and Ibn Muhriz (d. c. 97/715), had between them formulated the rhythmic and melodic modes known to our author (see Lois al Faruqi [1981], pp. 101-102; Farmer s.v. \"Ibn Misdjah,\" [El'], EX (Suppl.), p. 94; idem, s.v. \"The Music of Islam\" [NOHM]^ I, pp. 421-477; Wright [1966], etc.). TEXTUAL NOTES 1 Here Jabir is talking about rhythmic modes. 2 One of the \"famous rhythmic modes\" (al-cIqdcdt al-Mashhura) which are described, among others, by al-Farabl in his Kitab al-Miisiqd al-Kabir ([1967], p. 1022 ft.). According to the classical accounts, the \"first heavy\" has three long percussions, sometimes equal in duration, but more often the third one being longer than the other two, e.g. 4 beat -4 beat - 8 beat cycle in al-Farabl [1967], p. 1045 ff. (See Lois al Faruqi [1981], p. 369). 3 According to al-Farabl {op. cit., pp. 1038-1041), it had three slow percussions, forming an arithmetic progression: 4-6-8. 4 The invention of this mode is credited to Ibn Muhriz (Lois al Faruqi [1981], p. 276). al-Farabi tells us that it consisted of a three-percussion cycle beginning with one long percussion, followed by two short ones ([1967], pp. 1033-1037). Similar descriptions are found in al-Kindi and Ibn Sina (Lois al Faruqi, loc. cit.). Ramalis also a poetic meter. 5 Hazaj is a pre-Islamic Arabic term applied to one of the three kinds of singing in ancient Arabia (see al-cIqd al-Fartd of Ibn cAbd Rabbihi"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"216 CHAPTER 6 (d. 329/940) [1887], p. 186; Farmer [1941], p. 25). But the term also designates a conjunct rhythmic mode of moderate tempo, i.e., one in which all percussions are of equal duration and follow one another at regular intervals. According to Ibn Sina, hazaj designates any conjunct (muttasil) rhythmic mode ([1930], p. 92). But al-Farabi restricts the application of this term only to the conjunct {mutawassil) modes of moderate tempo ([1967], p. 453). Like ramal, hazaj is also a poetic meter. Lois al Faruqi adds that hazaj \"was thought to have been the first rythmic mode introduced in the new genre of song of the [1st/] 7th century known as ghina3 al-mutqan.\" ([1981], p. 94). 6 A three percussion cycle, two short followed by one longer (O.O.O. . . : 2-2-4). (See al-Farabi [1967], p. 1048). 7 This rhythmic mode is described by Farabi as a fast version of thaqil al-thani (OO.O. .. : 1 - 2 - 3) (al-Farabi [1967], p. 1042 ff. Cf. Farmer [1943], p. 82). 8 The \"rapid ramal is described variously by authorities. Thus al-Kindi says that it designates a rhythmic mode of either two or three percussions (OO. . : 1 - 2 or OOO. . . : 1 - 1 - 1) (see Farmer [1943], p. 85). But according to al-Farabi, the term was used for a rhythmic mode with two percussions, the first short, the second long (O.O. . . : 2 - 8) (al-Farabi [1967], p. 1029; p. 1033). In contrast, Ibn Sina tells us that it is made of three percussions of two different lengths (O.OO. . . : 2 - 1 - 2) (Ibn Sina [1935], p. 209). Cf. Lois al Faruqi [1974], pp. 134-135. 9 A conjunt rhythmic mode comprising a sequence of equal percussions performed at a tempo which allows only one percussion to be fitted between any two percussions (al-Farabi [1967], p. 451. See al Faruqi [1981] p. 143). 10 \"Asdbic\" literally means \"fingers,\" a term which designates the melodic modes known to have been organized into a system by the late lst/7th century musician Ibn Misjah (described by Ibn al-Munajjim (d. 300/912) in his Risala fiH-Muslqa [1976], pp. 853, 868 ff.). See Lois al Faruqi [1981] p. 20; Farmer [1957], p. 448; Wright [1978], p. 41. For Ibn Misjah see above. These modes are called \"fingers\" because they are named after the finger or fret position used for producing their starting tones (see notes below). Wright ([1978], pp. 250-251) tells us that at one stage these melodic modes were, indeed, allied to rhythmic modes to produce a corpus of 36 Turuq. This essentially verifies Jabir's claim. COMMENTARY AND TEXTUAL NOTES 217 11 See Chapter 3 above (for the phonetic terms 'motion' and 'rest' see n. 16 of that chapter). 12 Mutlaq, according to al-Farabi, designates the open string of a chordophone ([1967], p. 500). Jabir mentions it as one of the octave modes which were systematically described by later musical theorists such as cAbd al-Qadir ibn Ghaybi (d. 839/1435) (Lois al Faruqi [1981], p. 216). 13 Again, mazmum is described by Ibn Ghaybi as one of the six octave modes known collectively as the asabi' (Lois aJ Faruqi [1981], p. 180). 14 The term wustd signifies the use of the middle finger for producing the starting tone. (For a detailed account see Lois al Faruqi, [1981], p. 389). 15 Mahmul is mentioned by Ibn Ghaybi as one of the asabic, i.e. one of the six octave modes (Lois d Faruqi [1981], p. 164). [11] Somewhat side-stepping, Jabir now presents a pedagogical discourse on specific gravity and its practical applications in determing the constitution of alloys and other mixtures. Evidently, his essential source for all this is Archimedes. (For an account of Jabir's familiarity with Archimedes, see Chapter 1 above). In the Ikhrdj (Kraus ed. [1935], 92:8-9), Jabir distinguished between two kinds of Balances: the Balance of (gross) Weights (al-mizdn al-wazni), and the Balance of the Natures (mizdn al-tabaH'). The former measured the gross quantities of substances which enter into a mixture, while the latter determined the latent quantities of the natures in a simple body. We are being told in this section that the former is a close approximation of the latter. Of course, in the determination of the quantitative stucture of a simple body lay a truly divine science (\"al-Hlm al-ldhuti,\" Khamsin, qu. Kraus [1942-3], II, p. 188, n. 3), beyond the grasp of a common man {al-Sirr al-Maknun, ibid., p. 188, n. 7). Here, however, Jabir concerns himself with gross quantities of metals in a given alloy—i.e., he is concerned with al-mizdn al-wazni. [A] It is interesting to see how our author effectively undertakes a very tedious and challenging task: not only does the practitioner of Balance,"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"218 CHAPTER 6 we are told, have the expertise to determine (i) whether a given metal object consists of one metal or more, he is also able to (ii) determine the precise constitution of an alloy, and to (iii) measure accurately the weights of the constituents. Now, task (i) is straightforward, thanks to Jabir's knowledge of the hydrostatic balance, and his familiarity with the notion of specific gravity. (It is not clear, however, if our author knows what is called the Archimedian Principle—namely, the principle that the loss of weight suffered by a body in water = weight of the water displaced by the body). But (ii) and (iii) are practically impossible tasks if one follows Jabir's physical method, as opposed to chemical assaying. His method consists in taking a unit weight of each of the metals and finding out the loss of its weight in water when (a) it is unmixed, and (b) when it is mixed with other metals. From these observations one would compile a kind of 'ready reckoner' of alloys and their precise constitutions. But, then, in principle, such a catalogue will have an infinite number of listings, for metals can be mixed together in innumerable proportions of weights and in all different combinations! The only way one can save Jabir's method is by assuming that metals could be mixed together only in a small and known number of ways, and that their different proportions in alloys were not only finite, they were also known in advance. TEXTUAL NOTES 1 It has already been pointed out that in some parts of his corpus, our author includes \"glass\" in his list of metals. Von Lipmann identifies this substance as yellow amber (see Chapter 1 above). M We have here a partial description of the construction of an equal-arm balance. From the manner in which Jabir talks about it, one gets the impression that balance construction was a known art in his time: he mentions 'diagrams' without actually presenting them, and this could well mean that they were commonly known and he felt no need to reproduce them; similarly, we read phrases such as \"usual manner of balance construction,\" \"ordinary balances,\" and this betrays the same thing. COMMENTARY AND TEXTUAL NOTES 219 Indeed, we learn from external sources that since pre-Islamic times Harran was a place where many skilful mechanics were engaged in making balances, so accurate as to have become proverbial (see al-Maqdisl's al-Taqasim fi Ma'rifat al-Aqalim, qu. Wiedemann s.v. \"al-Mizan\" [EI1], V, p. 531; idem, \"Zur Technik der Araber,\" Fisher [1970]). In Chapter 1 above, we have referred to the rich and extensive account of balances in al-Khazinl's Mizdn al-Hikma which indicates, once again, that already by the middle of the 3rd/9th century the art of balance construction had reached in Islam a very high degree of sophistication. al-Khazinl illustrates, e.g., the elaborate balance of the alchemist al-Razi (Khanikoff ed. [1859], p. 86). It should be remarked that Jabir's balance looks like a crude one, and it is only through improvization that it functions as a hydrostatic balance. He describes a similar balance also in the Bahth, MS Jarullah 1721, f. 133 (See Kraus ed. [1935], p. 142, n. 12). TEXTUAL NOTES 1 The term 'tongue' designates the needle which functions as the pointer of an equal-arm balance. It is fixed at the centre of gravity of the steel beam and divides it into two equal arms. This tongue moves with respect to a carriage which is attached at right angles to the beam. 2 bankan = finjan. The word is of Persian origin (see Kraus ed. [1935], p. 142, n. 12). 3 Jabir seems to be stating an empirical law that in a silver-gold alloy, the weight of the silver in the alloy : loss of weight of the alloy in water = 1 : V12. [12] Jabir returns to his main theme, the Balance of Letters. He seems to believe that in drugs one nature dominates all others. We recall that in his subdivisions of a Degree, the highest unit is degree: only one nature in a drug, the author tells us, can exist in weights large enough to be measured in degrees. The remaining three natures were measurable only in the smaller subdivisions—grades, minutes, seconds, etc."},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"220 CHAPTER 6 [13] Here once again the \"Supreme Principle of Balance\" is emphasized, namely that in all things the four natures exist in the proportion 1:3:5:8, conforming to 17. This number is now identified with form. Jabir is here explaining the practical steps one ought to take in order to make the natures of a thing conform to 17. This matter has already been discussed in Chapter 3 above (see especially \"Application of the Balance of Letters\"). [14] The only point of interest in this beginning is its Shici character: note the epithet \"Wall\" for cAll. As we have already remarked (see Chapter 1), Jabir is not at all consistent in his sectarian sympathies, for in the beginning of the next part of our text he will show, and just as clearly, his «0»-ShIcI leanings. [15] On the whole this section presents no major difficulty. TEXTUAL NOTES 1 That is, when the weights they signify do not exactly add up to 17 or its multiple. 2 It is not altogether clear what, in this context, the author means by decomposition of bodies. [16] The first paragraph of this section is highly obscure. There is no explanation as to how the author arrives at the numerical values for the natures in animals, plants and stones. Surely, by virtue of his own doctrine, these values depend on the names of these objects—how can he, then, give them a fixed precalculated value without regard to their specific names? COMMENTARY AND TEXTUAL NOTES 221 TEXTUAL NOTES 1 One notes that all three manuscripts contain a numerical error here. But more surprising is the fact that Kraus too reproduces this mistake in his text (Kraus ed. [1935], 159:12-13). See critical notes to Edited Text, 15:8-9 above where this error has been specified. Indeed, according to [3] above, the weight of the degree in the First Degree of intensity is 777,600,000 dirhams. 2 See [3] above. [17] Given below is a tabular representation of these 'Socratic' values: 1st Deg. Ilnd Deg. Illrd Deg. IVth Deg. 1 : 3 : 5 : 8 danaq danaq danaq danaq Degree 7 21 35 56 Grade 3 9 15 24 Minute 2Vi 7l/2 Utt 20 Second 2 6 10 16 Third m AlA 7Vi 12 Fourth I 3 5 8 Fifth Yi. l'/2 2Vi 4 (Note that all weights here are given in danaqs. For Jabir's system of units see Chapter3, n. 69, above.) While we see that Jabir's Socrates also believes in the proportion 1 : 3 : 5 : 8, his values, unlike those of Balinas, do not form a sexagesimal geometric progression (see below). In fact from the fifth to the grade, the 'Socratic' values constitute an arithmetic progression (thus in the First Degree we have: 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3), but this progression breaks down when we reach the values assigned to degrees. TEXTUAL NOTES 1 Again, all three manuscripts, as well the text of Kraus (ed. [1935], 160:7), contain an error. See critical notes to Edited Text, 15:14."},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"222 CHAPTER 6 [18] Socrates is perhaps the only classical historical figure for whom Jabir has an unreserved admiration. He is always referred to with a great deal of respect, and he is always preferred over others, appearing throughout as an authority par excellence (see Chapter 1, n. 29 above; see also [27] below). But Jabir's Socrates is without doubt a pseudo figure, for our author does not seem to know any of his genuine ideas. In fact, in the TajmF Socrates is presented as the pioneer of the Science of Artificial Generation! (Kraus ed. [1935], 377 ff.). Similarly, the Kitab al-Fidda (Book of Silver, Kr 948) records a historically impossible conversation between Socrates and Thales (Kraus [1942-3], I, p. 113). In the last paragraph of this section, Jabir expresses indifference with respect to Balinas and Socrates—follow whichever system takes your fancy, he says. Yet it is interesting that throughout the rest of the Ahjar, he follows 'Socrates,' without, in fact, giving his own system of subdivisions of a degree. Jabir's remarks concerning the sexagesimal system are also to be noted. In fact, a similar view is expressed by Theon of Alexandria (4th century A.D.) which has been cited by Thureau-Dangin in his work on the history of the sexagesimal system (Thureau-Dangin [1932]). TEXTUAL NOTES 1 In this paragraph, Jabir's expressions are exceedingly convoluted. Evidently, all he intends to say is that in developing a system of units, one has no choice but to adopt a sexagesimal progression. The reason? He explains immediately below that the sexagesimal system simplifies calculations. [19] Concerning this table see the remarks in Chapter 3 above (see especially n. 69). In fact, it is esentially the same as the 'Socratic' table given in [17] above which has here been related to the letters of the alphabet according to the ABJAD scheme (see Chapter 3, n. 68). COMMENTARY AND TEXTUAL NOTES 223 [20] Jabir begins to talk about metals which he here calls fusible stones. More frequently, however, metals are referred to in the corpus by the appellation 'ajsad' (sing. jas ad). Further, here he names only six metals, elsewhere we find a list of seven; the substances listed as metals likewise keep changing (for a fuller discussion see Kraus [1942-3], II, pp. 18-30. See also the remarks concerning Jabir's classification of substances in Chapter 1 above). We observe metals being classified according to color. Red metals, we are taught, have a prepoderance of hot-dry (this corresponds to Aristode's primary body Fire); in white metals, on the other hand, cold-moist dominate (corresponding to Aristode's Water), (cf. Chapter 3 above). It should be remarked that even though Jabir's specific red and white classification is original to him, color has remained since ancient times a fundamental criterion for the classification of substances and has a fascinating chemical history (see Crosland [1962], pp. 30-32, 66-73). In one form or another, color classification is found throughout Arabic alchemy (see, e.g., Stapleton, Azo and Husain [1927], pp. 367, 385). TEXTUAL NOTES 1 He does give the tables at the end of this second part of his book. 2 Note that throughout Jabir makes the natures conform to the proportion 1:3:5:8. [21] Within the internal perspective of the Jabirian system, there is no obscurity in this passage if it is read in conjunction with the 'Socratic' table reproduced in section [19] of the translation above. Here the author extends his color classification to all corporeal objects of the natural world. We are told that the total weight of the four natures in every natural object, when these objects are considered \"according to the precise Balance,\" is exactly 17 x 7 dan.—a multiple of 17. This means that all corporeal objects are quantitatively identical. Indeed this was so, but only in the case of ideal bodies represented by the letters alif ba^.jim and ddl (ABJAD). In practice, to be sure, the names of physical bodies did not necessarily have these four letters, a fact emphasized by the"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"224 CHAPTER 6 author's repeated declaration that the weight of 19 dir. and 5 dan. \"is the figure arrived at according to the precise balance\"—i.e. how it ought to be; for, in practice, one had to make the total weight conform to 17. (See Chapter 3 above, especially \"Application of the Balance of Letters\" where Jabir's idea of external/internal natures has been discussed). TEXTUAL NOTES 1 Like Aristotle, Jabir believes that hot and cold were active qualities, whereas dry and moist were passive (see Meteor., 4.1, 378b; Gen. et Corr., 1.6-7, 322b-324a; ibid., 2.2, 329b-330a). [22] In effect, Jabir here gives a clear expression to his belief in the corporeality of the four qualities in the natural world (see Chapter 2 above). Indeed, the question he is considering arises as a logical consequence of this belief: if all bodies contain all four natures, then all bodies contain a given nature as well as its contrary. Now if these contraries are of equal strength, how is it that they don't cancel each other out? And if they are of unequal strength, why doesn't the stronger neutralize the weaker? Jabir provides what may be called a spatial explanation. The natures are placed in such a way that they don't come into contact with their contraries—and this prevents mutual destruction, or the neutralization of one by the other. This explanation makes perfect sense within the context of the Jabirian cosmology: the four natures were corporeal entities, so they necessarily occupy place. [23] The doctrine that qualities must occupy place now leads the author naturally to his concept of equilibrium. While this has already been examined in Chapter 2 above (where Kraus' paraphrase of this passage has also been quoted), one might add here two further observations. (a) From the standpoint of the science of mechanics, Jabir's concept of equilibrium is perfectly legitimate for, effectively, equilibrium is viewed by him as a balance of natural forces. At the macro level, he COMMENTARY AND TEXTUAL NOTES 225 evidently identifies equilibrium with the state of rest (the phrase \"and it is not a [flowing] liquid\" is an unmistakable evidence). And at the micro level, equilibrium is identified with being in an integral state—if this were not so, the object would explode. Here, no doubt, Jabir has in mind some idea of balance of forces acting on the elementary constituents of a solid body. (b) An account of equilibrium in a different context appears in Jabir's later work, the al-Mawazin al-Saghir where he says, \"I have shown you by examples the necessity of equilibrium in the performance of the Great Work . . . You must know that this equilibrium is indispensable in the Science of Balance and the practice of the Work.\" (Berthelot ed. [1893], III, 115:2-4). (It should be noted that the al-Mawazin al-Saghir is different from the al-Mlzdn al-Saghir which latter forms part of the Books of Balances. Due no doubt to the similarity of the two titles, Needham in his [1980], V, iv, p. 477 confuses the two). TEXTUAL NOTES 1 That is, elements pass into one another—this is an assertion of Jabir's belief in transmutation. [24] Like many other (in the case of Jabir all) substances, elixirs were classified by the alchemists of Islam into two groups—red and white. The former were supposed to turn its subject into gold, the latter into silver (see Haschimi [1962]). As a standard principle of classification, this idea had also found its way into the alchemical tradition of the Latin West. Thus, e.g., one reads in the Speculum Alchemiae of Roger Bacon that \"the red elixir makes substances yellow infinitely and transmutes all metals into the purest gold\" (qu. Crosland [1962], p. 31). Haschimi, op. cit., has dicussed red and white elixirs in terms of ion exchange coatings on metals. Jabir says that in red elixirs hot-dry dominate, in white cold-moist. But this is identical to his explanation of red and white metals. Moreover, the effective weight of the elixir (i.e. the total weight of its natures), he tells us, is 19 dirhams and 5 danaqs (= 17 x 7 dan., a multiple of 17)— and this is precisely the effective weight he gave, specifically, to the metals and, generally, to all (ideal) corporeal objects (see [20] and [21] above)."},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"226 CHAPTER 6 This means that elixirs are nothing but ideal metals. Indeed, already in the al-Rahma al-Kabir, which is Jabir's earliest extant work, he had categorically stated that \"the red elixir is of the same nature as gold. . . . The white elixir is of the same nature as silver.\" (Berthelot [1893], III, 150:15-17). Elixirs were ideal metals because in practice no metal had a weight precisely of 17 * 7 dan.\\ one had to augment (ziyada) or suppress (nuqsan) their natures in order to make them conform to 17. The last passage in this section explicidy repeats the Jabirian idea that the quantitative structure of all natural objects is ultimately identical— \"all our examples signify the number 17. . (see [21] above). [25] The Jabirian distinction between letters as units of articulated speech and letters as signs of the Arabic script is clearly expressed here. As we have discussed in Chapter 3 above, the former were for Jabir natural entities, while the latter were no more than a mere convention. Maintaining with remarkable consistency his ontological equivalence between the letters (in the former sense) and the four natures, the author now speaks of transmutation in alphabetical terms: indeed, physical change in an object was in his system equivalent to a change in the name of the object. Thus, in keeping with this doctrine of the equivalence of physical and nominal transformations, Jabir here speaks of a change of \"aliF into \"ba3\" or into \"jlm\" or into \"dal,\" etc., rather than speaking of a change of, say, Earth into Fire, or into Air, or into Water, etc. This passage provides a further instance of Jabir's logical consistency—while speaking of tranformation of one letter into another he says \"provided you derive these letters from the Second Elements, namely, Fire, Air, Water and Earth.\" To be sure, it was in the Jabirian system not the natures but the four Empedoclean elements which passed into one another. The natures, being the First Elements, maintained their individual character—neither did they transform into one another nor destroy one another. Logically speaking, the primitive elements had to have these features, for it was in terms of these elements that all else had to be explained. COMMENTARY AND TEXTUAL NOTES 227 [26] [A] Jabir now explicidy identifies ideal metals with elixir. We also find a categorical statement here that elixirs are, indeed, ideal objects, for they are practically non-existent. Once again, as in [23], our author expresses no romance for gold! IB] We are told that in order to transform a metal into elixir all one had to do is make the total weight of its natures precisely 17x7 danaqs (see [24] above). Indeed, Jabir is remarkably consistent in this matter. [27] Quite courageously, the author contends with the embarrassing question of the plurality of names of a given thing. But he resolves the issue quite simply by saying that all langauges \"seek to express a unique langauge,\" and this unique langauge was concerned only with meanings. The passage here is perfectly accurate in its survey of different appellations applied to the metal tin, namely: qalaci; zdwus (= Zeus, identified with the planet Jupiter); and qasdir (= Cr. kassiteros). For Jabir to make a group say that \"its [tin's] sibling is called ' usrub' \" is to make a statement which is also historically true, for indeed lead and tin were often distinguished as rasas al-usrub, and rasas al-qala^i (for a detailed discussion of these names see Goltz [1972], especially pp. 243-245). And here, once again, one notices Jabir's preference for Socrates (cf. [18] above). TEXTUAL NOTES 1 The planet Jupiter. 2 At the end of this part of our text, the author does produce a table of calculation of the weights of the natures in tin: indeed, this has been worked out according to the appellation \"Zawus.\""},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"228 CHAPTER 6 [28] In sharp contrast to the opening words in the \"Second Part,\" note the non-ShicI character of this opening: to call Muhammad an Imam is to disregard the very foundation of sectarian Shrism! [29] From what we have so far read of Jabir, it is already quite clear that his concerns are not limited to the inanimate world of what he calls stones. Rather, his system claims to be applicable to all natural objects: not only to inorganic substances, but equally to plant and animal substances. This is a distinguishing feature not only of Jabir, but of the Arabic alchemical tradition itself, for the interest of Hellenistic alchemists had never reached beyond the realm of the inanimate. (It is for this reason that Needham refuses to call them alchemists at all—they were, according to him, \"Greek protochemists,\" that is, artisans, not philosophers. See Needham[1980], V, iv, passim). In contrast, the alchemists of Islam showed from the very beginning a sustained interest in medicine, in drugs, and in the phenomenon of life in general (an important study in this regard is that of Temkin [1953]). Not only did these alchemists apply their principles, operations and products to all three kingdoms of nature, most of them also drew their materials from all three realms (Ibn Umayl is an exception. See Ali, Stapleton and Husain [1933]). Thus, historians of alchemy are united in their observation that, notwithstanding ancient China, it was the Arabs who introduced plant and animal substances into the repertoire of alchemy, and that this is one of their major contributions to that complex phenomenon which led to the emergence of modern science. From this point of view, Jabir's passage at hand is of outstanding historical significance. Jabir s elixir, we note, can be made out of both organic and inorganic substances. Thus it is declared that elixirs are of seven types: three uncombined, three with constituents drawn from two of the natural realms in different combinations, and one made of substances taken from all three realms. COMMENTARY AND TEXTUAL NOTES 229 [A] When read in conjunction with the table in section [19] of the translation above, this passage presents no difficulty. Our author is now applying his Supreme Principle to elixirs. Like everything else, elixirs possessed the four natures in the proportion 1 : 3 : 5 : 8. But as to which nature corresponded to which term in this proportion, this depended on the name of the elixir. We are reminded that depending upon its position, the letter alif can represent four different weights. In his table, Jabir has already given the quantity of these weights which he here restates. IB] Ceration (tashmic = Gr. enkerosis) is a standard process of chemical craft. As its etymology suggests, it is a process of softening a substance so that when dropped on a hot plate, it readily melts like wax, without evolution of fumes. As a technique, ceration is certainly known to Jabir for he mentions it in its usual sense in, e.g., the Kitab al-Lahiit (Book of Divinity, Kr 123, MS Jarullah 1554, f. 4b, see Kraus [1942-3], I, p. 45). The alchemist RazI has in fact devoted a whole section to this process in his Kitab al-Asrar (Book of the Secrets, qu. Stapleton, Azo and Husain [1927], p. 332), a work in which he invokes the authority of our author referring to him as \"our master Jabir ibn Hayyan\" {ibid., p. 385). What is strange, however, is Jabir's identification of ceration with augmentation of the natures in a body. Surely, he is not speaking from the point of view of the actual techniques of ceration, for there is no explanation as to how one carries it out. All we are told is that the transformation of a stone (mineral substance) into elixir consists in two distinct steps: (a) determination of the preponderant nature in the stone, and (b) adding a 'fifth' to this nature (fifth, we recall, is Jabir's smallest subdivision of a Degree), whose four different numerical values are given from the table which appears under [19] of the translation above. But how does one go about doing this?"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"230 CHAPTER 6 [C] The method of 'ceration' of animal substances was similar to the one preceding. To the dominant nature, one added a 'fourth'—this is the second smallest subdivision of the Jabirian Degree. Here one notes Jabir's peculiar use of the term 'elixir'. Clearly, in the present context, 'elixir' denotes any substance which is the subject of alchemical operation. It is necessary to read the text in this way because, otherwise, Jabir's assertions concerning the transformation of the elixir from \"one thing to another\" would make no sense: in its usual meaning, elixir was not a patient but an agent of transformation! Again, all the numerical values come from the table reproduced in section [19] of the translation above. [D] To 'cerate' a substance derived from plants, we are told, one added a 'third'—the next higher subdivision of the Degree—to the preponderant nature. The weights are all specified from [19]. Once again, 'elixir' = any substance to be operated upon. [30] Here I present to the reader a textual discovery of mine. What we have at hand, I hereby declare, is a hitherto unknown Arabic rendering of Aristotle's Categoriae, 8, 8b25-l la37, a discovery which is likely to have profound consequences for the whole question of the transmission of Greek ideas into the world of Islam. Some forty years ago, the well-known authority on the Arabic tradition of Aristotle, Richard Walzer, had called it common knowledge\" that the \"Arabic Categories.. . [is] due to Ishaq ibn Hunayn [d. 299/911].\" (Walzer [1962], p. 67). Indeed, no other Arabic translation of this work of Aristotle has hitherto been known despite the fact that it had generated such monumental and sustained interest among the philosophical writers of Islam that we have received from them a considerable legacy of Arabic Categoriae literature in the form of commentaries, paraphrases, introductions, and the like (see Peters [1968]; Walzer, op. cit.\\ Zimmermann [1981]). It seems, then, that the COMMENTARY AND TEXTUAL NOTES 231 discovery of another translation would warrant a somewhat happy revision of the position stated by Walzer. To be sure, as I shall demonstrate, there is clear evidence in the Jabirian translation that it is totally and significantly independent of Ishaq's text. More than that, it shows a remarkable ignorance of the Arabic philosophical terminology found in the latter, terminolgy which had been definitively fixed and standardized by the second half of the 3rd/9th century. Further, in its style the Jabirian text is much cruder than that of Ishaq displaying what seems to be an archaic character. And finally, as we shall presently witness, the Jabirian translator sometimes shrinks from translating Aristotle's philosophical terms, providing instead a gloss or presenting the original text in the form of paraphrases and adaptations; thus, our Arabic text betrays a translator not quite at home with the Greek logical tradition. All these features converge to suggest an earlier date for Jabir's version. The possible existence of a pre-Ishaq Arabic translation of the Categoriae is hardly an anomaly, for we already know of the living Syriac tradition of Aristotelian logic which had been inherited by Islam from the Hellenized centers of the Near East. Thus, as early as the beginning of the 2nd/8th century, available to Arabic writers was an enormous corpus of Syriac Categoriae literature which included not only numerous commentaries, but at least two independent translations—one of them by James of Edessa (d. 90/708) (Georr ed. [1948], pp. 253-305), or possibly by Sergius of Rishcayna (d. 536 A.D.) (see Tkatsch [1928-32], I, p. 70b); the other by the famous scholar of the school of Qennesre, George, Bishop of the Arabs (d. 106/724) (Gottheil ed. [1893]; cf. Furlani [1933]). A third Syriac translation was produced somewhat later, and this is attributed Job of Edessa [fl. c. 184-336/800-850) (see Georr, op. cit., p. 380). Furthermore, as I have pointed out earlier (Chapter 2, n. 28), contem-porary scholars now generally agree that Porphyry's familiar introduction to the Categoriae, the Eisagoge, marks the first entry of Aristotle into the world of Islam. As for the earliest Arabic translation of the Eisagoge, its critical editor Danishpazhuh concludes that the traditional attribution of this text to the well-known translator of Pahlevi works Abu Muhammad cAbdAllah ibn al-Muqaffac (d. 142/760) is correct, and that, contrary to the contention of Kraus (see Kraus [1933], pp. 1-5), this work cannot be credited to his son Muhammad ibn cAbdAllah ibn al-Muqaffac (Danishpazhuh ed. [1978], pp. 65-66). Given all this, the claim seems"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"232 CHAPTER 6 highly plausible that there existed more than a single version of the Arabic Categoriae; equally plausible seems the further claim that there did exist a version considerably earlier than that of Ishaq. Turning now to my evidence, I have, in what follows, juxtaposed the texts of Aristode and of Jabir, carrying out a direct comparison of the Arabic translation with its source. The two texts are then compared and contrasted with Ishaq's rendering. ARISTOTLE (Minio-Paluello ed. [1956], Ackrill tr. [1963]) By quality I mean that in virtue of which things are said to be qualified somehow (8b25). jAbir (Edited Text, 30:1-33:17) Quality is a certain condition of the qualified thing, I mean the condition by virtue of which the thing is qualified. It seems that we have here a free and somewhat crude translation. Note that there is in Aristotle no mention of conditions as yet. In contrast, Ishaq's translation is much more elegant and strictly literal, thus: \"wa usamma bi^l-kayfiyyati tilka^l-lati lahd yuqdlu ji^l-ashkhasi kayfa hiya.\" (Badawi ed. [1948], 29:13). One kind of quality let us call states and conditions. A state differs from a condition in being more stable and lasting longer. Such are the branches of knowl-edge and the virtues. For knowledge seems to be something permanent and hard to change . . . (8b27-30). It is what are easily changed and quickly changing that we call conditions (8b35). Among these conditions are those which exist in actuality, such as the walking of AhdAllah when he is, in fact, walking. Further, among such actually existing conditions are either those which change or disappear quickly, for example standing, sitting, being in a state of embarrassment or anger, and the like—such actually existing condi-tions do not last long; or those which are [more stable and] do not change or disappear quickly, such as [the knowledge of] geometry, medicine, or music when [such knowledge] is actually present in an individual. COMMENTARY AND TEXTUAL NOTES 233 Providing its own gloss and its own illustrative examples, the Jabirian text gives what is virtually a terminology-free rendering. In contrast, Ishaq remains strictly faithful to the source and translates all terminolgy accurately: thus, kind (eidos) = naw^ ; state (hexis) = malaka ; condition (,diathesis) = hal (Badawi ed., 29:15). Note that our translator has no terminology to render into Arabic the nuance between \"states\" and \"conditions\"; the word \"'hal\" has to perform both functions. Thus, rather than translating the two terms of Aristotle, the Jabirian text explains them. Another kind of quality is that in virtue of which we call people boxers or runners or healthy or sickly—anything, in short, which they are called in virtue of a natu-ral capacity or incapacity. For it is not because one is in some condi-tion that one is called anything of this sort, but because one has a natural capacity for doing some-thing easily . . . (9a 13-18). Simi-larly with the hard and the soft: the hard is so called because it has the capacity not to be divided easily, the soft because it has an in-capacity for this same thing (9a25-27). A third kind of quality consists of affective qualities and affections (9a28). And among the conditions are those which exist in potentiality, as walking is to \"AbdAllah (thus, animals are plants in potentiality, in actuality they are not, and the same applies to stones in relation to plants and animals). Similar is the case of the acquisition of [the knowledge] of geometry when it is unacquired [in actuality]. Further, potential conditions exist either [a] as a capacity in a thing, such as our saying that cAbdAllah is [in a state of being] fallen to the ground when he has the capacity to do so; or [b] as a natural affection, such as our saying that a given stone is hard, meaning that it cannot be divided easily, or that a given piece of wood is soft, meaning that it can be broken apart without difficulty. Another Jabirian gloss. Aristotle's idea of qualification in virtue of a natural capacity (dunamisphusike = Ishaq's quwwa tabiHyya, Badawi ed., 30:18), and his affective qualities (pathetikai poiotetes = Ishaq's kayfiyydt infi'-aliyya, ibid., 31:9) and affections (pathe = Ishaq's infi'-alat, loc. cit.) are both effectively subsumed in our text under potentially existing qualities (bPl-quwwa). Once again, Ishaq gives a faithful rendering and,"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"234 CHAPTER 6 as we just witnessed, translates Greek terms directly and rigorously. Note, however, that Aristotle's example of the hard (skleros) and soft (malakos) has been faithfully reproduced in the Jabirian text, but the rendering of the latter term is here rakhw as opposed to Ishaq's lin {ibid., 31:7). . . . When such circumstances have their origin in affections that are hard to change and permanent they are called qualities. For if pallor or darkness have come about in the natural make-up they are called qualities (for in virtue of them we are said to be qualified); and if pallor or darkness have resulted from long illness or from sunburn, and do not easily give way .. . these too are called quali-ties. .. . But those that result from something that easily disperses and quickly gives way are called affec-tions; for people are not, in virtue of them, said to be qualified somehow. Thus a man who red-dens through shame is not called ruddy, nor one who pales in fright pallid . . . (9b20-32). Things are rarely said in discourse to be qualified—I mean character-ized—by those conditions which change or disappear quickly. Thus we do not call pallid the one who turns yellow out of fright, nor swarthy the one who turns black due to a journey [in the heat of the sun]. As for the conditions which last longer, things might be said to be qualified by them. Thus we call yellow (or, say, black) that which acquires this color as part of its natural make-up (likewise, if it acquires some other condition which is not easily removed [it is called accordingly]). And these, I mean the conditions which do not disappear easily, are the ones which ought necessarily to be called qualities, since the essential nature of a thing is qualified by them. In contradistinction to Ishaq, the Jabirian translator does not follow the order of the original text. One also notes several Jabirian glosses. Aristode speaks of swarthiness resulting from sunburn; our text changes sunburn to journey, obviously meaning a journey in the heat of the sun. Ishaq, on the other hand, does translate \"sunburn\" literally (ihraq shams, Badawi ed., 32:16). Similarly, unlike the case with Ishaq, the example of reddening out of shame has been omitted in our text. For the term phusike sustasis Ishaq has the Arabic equivalent al-jibilla al-tabiHyya {ibid., 32:14); in the Jabirian text it is mizaj. The last sentence in the latter speaks of essential nature (jawhar), and this is another gloss. COMMENTARY AND TEXTUAL NOTES 235 Similarly there might be in the soul either [a] easily disappearing conditions, such as sadness or happiness arising out of a certain specific reason and passing away quickly, or [b] longer lasting con-ditions, such as sadness or happi-ness arising out of one's innate disposition for it. Obviously the latter is identical [in appearance] to the former. However, we do not characterize as sad one who is sad for a short period of time for some reason, nor happy one who is happy briefly. Rather, we do so when these are part of someone's essential nature, whence perma-nent or preponderant. We have here a lucid paraphrase. Note again the absence of technical terminolgy from the Jabirian text; thus, unlike the literal translation of Ishaq, no direct Arabic equivalents appear for \"affective qualities\" and \"affections,\" and Aristotle's idea of such qualities as are present from birth is expressed by the commonly used word \"ka^in (which has been translated by me rather freely). A fourth kind of quality is shape and the external form of each thing, and in addition straightness and curvedness and anything like these. For in virtue of each of these a thing is said to be qualified somehow; because it is a triangle or square it is said to be qualified somehow, and because it is straight or curved . . . (10all-15). Similarly with regard to the soul also we speak of affective qualities and affections. Those which are present right from birth as a result of certain affections are called qualities. . . . Similarly with any aberrations that are not natural but result from some other circum-stances, and are hard to get rid of or even completely unchangeable; such things, too, are qualities, for in virtue of them people are said to be qualified. But those which result from things that quickly subside are called affections, e.g. if a man in distress is rather bad-tempered; for the man who in such an affection is rather bad-tempered is not said to be bad-tempered .. . (9b33-10a8). Shape, external form, straightness, curvedness and the like are also qualities, for each one of these is said to qualify things. Thus, we might say of a thing that it is a triangle or a square, or that it is straight or curved."},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"236 CHAPTER 6 A reasonably faithful translation and similar, though not identical, to that of of Ishaq. Thus in both translations: skhema = shakl; huparkhousa morphe = khilqa ; euthes = istiqama ; kampulotes - inhina3. But, in contrast to our translator, Ishaq follows Aristotle's text very closely and— typically—gives a literal rendering (Badawi ed., 33:13-17). 'Rare' and 'dense' and 'rough' and 'smooth' might be thought to signify a qualification; they seem, however, to be foreign to the classification of qualification. . . . For a thing is dense when its parts are close together, rare because they are separated from one another; smooth because its parts lie somehow on a straight line, rough because some stick up above others (10a 16-24). Rareness, denseness, roughness, and the like might be thought of as qualities; they seem however not to belong to qualities. This is so because, to be precise, a thing is dense when its parts are close together; rare when they are sepa-rated from one another; smooth because its parts lie uniformly on a straight line—none being above or below another; and rough when they are otherwise. Again, a faithful translation and close to Ishaq's. Note, however, that while both texts employ the same Arabic root to translate Aristode's four terms (manos, puknos, trakhus, leios), Ishaq remains strictly literal and renders them as adjectives (mutakhalkhalmutakathaf, etc., Badawi ed., 33:17); the Jabirian translator renders them as verbal nouns (takhalkhul takathuf, etc.). Perhaps some other manner of quality might come to light, but we have made a pretty complete list of those most spoken of (10a25-26). Qualities are possibly of other kinds too. Among these other kinds which we shall mention are. . .. In contrast to the brief sentence of Aristotle, the Jabirian translator adds another ten kinds of qualities to the list. These are nowhere to be found in Minio-Paluello's text. COMMENTARY AND TEXTUAL NOTES 237 Now in most cases, indeed in practically all, things are called paronymously, as pale man from paleness, the grammatical from grammar, the just from justice, and so on. But in some cases, because there are no names for the qualities, it is impossible for the things to be called paronymously from them . . . (10a28-32). Qualified things are named after their quality. Thus in most cases things are named paronymously— such as katib from kitdba, jd ~'ir from jawr, cadil from cadl. Yet this may not be so in all cases, either because the quality in question exists in potentiality, or due to the fact that language lacks a name for it. The Jabirian text follows Aristotle closely but does add its own gloss. Thus, out of the three illustrative examples given in the source (the pale from paleness, the grammatical from garmmar, the just from justice), the first two have been changed to \"the writer from writing,\" and \"the unjust from injustice\"; the third one is faithfully reproduced. Not so with Ishaq. The difference in the approaches of the two translators is also reflected by the overall technical nature of the latter's renderings: thus paronumos has been translated by Ishaq as a formal term c aid tariq al-mushtaqqa (Badawi ed., 34:7-8); in contrast, the Jabirian translation is clearly non-technical. Note that our text gives two reasons why things are not called paronymously: either there is no name for the quality, or the quality exists only in potentiality. The latter is not explicitly stated in Aristode. There is contrariety in regard to qualification. For example, justice is contrary to injustice and white-ness to blackness, and so on; also things said to be qualified in virtue of them—the unjust to the just and the white to the black. But this is not so in all cases; for there is no contrary to red or yellow or such colors though they are quali-fications (10b 12-17). There is contrariety with regard to qualifications. For example, justice is contrary to injustice and white-ness to blackness and so on. Simi-larly there is contrariety in regard to qualified things. For example, just is contrary to unjust and white to black. But, [on the other hand], there is no contrary to red or yel-low or such colors. Likewise, there is no contrary to triangle and circle. A faithful translation, but dissimilar to that of Ishaq. There is also a terminological difference: our text has ahmar for red as against Ishaq's"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"238 CHAPTER 6 ashqar (Badawi ed., 35:12). It is interesting to see the Jabirian translator adding to Aristode's red and yellow his own two examples of circle and triangle. Further, if one of a pair of contraries is a qualification, the other too will be a qualification. This is clear if one examines other predicates. For example, if justice is contrary to injustice and justice is a qualification, then injustice too is a qualification. For none of the other predicates fits injustice, neither quality nor relative nor where nor in fact any other such predicate except qualification . . . (10bl8-25). Further, when one of a pair of contraries is a qualification, the other too will be a qualification. This is clear if one examines other categories. For example, justice is contrary to injustice and justice is a qualification, then injustice too is a qualification. For none of the other categories fits injustice, neither quality, for example, nor relation, place, time, nor any other category except qualification. We have here a lucid, accurate and highly faithful translation. But, again, it differs from Ishaq's—for instance, in our text we have maqula for kategoria; Ishaq has naH (Badawi ed., 35:14) Qualifications admit of a more and a less; for one thing is called more pale or less pale than an-other, and more just that another. Moreover, it itself sustains increase . . .—not in all cases though, but in most. It might be questioned whether one justice is called more a justice than another, and similar-ly for other conditions. For some people dispute about such cases. They utterly deny that one justice is called more or less a justice than another, or one health more or less a health, though they say that one person has health less than an-other, justice less than another and Qualifications admit of a more and a less; for it may be said that this whiteness is more than that, or that this thing is whiter than that—not in all cases though but in most. Thus it might be questioned whether it is per-missible to call one justice more a justice than another, or one health more a health than another. Some people say it is not permissible, yet they say that one has health less than another, justice less than another, and similarly with writing and other conditions. So, as for things spoken of in virtue of these, they unquestionably admit of a COMMENTARY AND TEXTUAL NOTES 239 similarly with grammar and the other conditions. At any rate things spoken of in virtue of these admit of a more or less: one man is called more grammatical than another, juster, healthier, and so on (10b26-lla4). more and a less, for it may well be said that this man is more eloquent than that, this man is more just than that, or that this man is better with regard to justice and health. Even though the Jabirian text adds its own gloss here and there, it gives a fairly faithful translation; and here, despite clear differences in formula-tions, our translator is quite close to Ishaq. Triangle and square do not seem to admit of a more, nor does any other shape. For things which admit the definition of triangle or circle are equally triangles or circles, while of things which do not admit it none will be called more that than another—a square is not more a circle than an oblong is, for neither admits the definition of circle. In short, unless both admit the definition of what is under discussion neither will be called more than the other. Thus not all qualifications admit of a more and a less (1 Ia5-14). However, not all things spoken of in virtue of a quality admit of a more and a less. For example, the triangle . . . and the square ... do not admit of a more and a less. For one triangle does not exceed an-other in respect of triangularity, and one square does not possess more squareness than another. . . . Things which are equally said to be triangles [and thus] equally said to fall under the definition [of tri-angularity] are not called more or less with respect to that definition; the same holds for circles and squares. ... In general, all things which are equally said to fall under a given definition, as well as two things which are not said to fall under one definition, such things do not admit of a more and a less. One speaks of a more and a less only in cases where the [quality to whose] definition a thing con-forms sustains increase and de-crease; for example, a white thing which conforms to the definition"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"240 CHAPTER 6 of being white can very well be more or less with respect to whiteness. We have here a rendering that is full of Jabirian gloss, some of which I have omitted in this citation (but see Edited Text, 32:17-33:8). One notes also some rearrangement of the source: Aristotle's last sentence appears first; whereas the last Jabirian sentence seems to be based directly on the former's second sentence in the immediately preceding citation (\"Moreover, it itself sustains increase . . .\"). The Jabirian terminology in this passage differs markedly from that of Ishaq: thus, for logos our text has hadd as opposed to Ishaq's literal translation qawl (Badawi ed., 36:12); the former skips Aristotle's reference to oblong, the latter has the standard term mustatil (ibid., 36:14). Nothing so far mentioned is distinctive of quality, but it is in virtue of qualities only that things are called similar and dissimilar; a thing is not similar to another in virtue of anything but that virtue of which it is qualified (1 lal 5-18). in It is in virtue of a universally defined quality that things are said to be similar or dissimilar; for a thing is not similar to another except in virtue of its quality. For example this triangle is not similar to that triangle except in virtue of the triangle which has already been universally defined. While Ishaq and the Jabirian translator have identical translations for homoios and anomoios (shabih, ghayr shabih), the former provides a faithful and accurate rendering of the source; the latter, as we note, presents a paraphrase. We should not be disturbed lest someone may say that though we proposed to discuss quality we are counting in many relatives. . . . For in pretty well all such cases the genera are spoken of in relation to something, but none of the par-ticular cases is. For knowledge, a genus, is called just what it is, of It may be said that though we only proposed to discuss qualities we have frequently mentioned rela-tives since we have spoken of knowledge and the like, and knowledge exists in virtue of the known. Indeed, the genera com-prehending these things, I mean the universals, are spoken of in COMMENTARY AND TEXTUAL NOTES 241 something else . . . ; but none of the particular cases is called just what it is, of something else. For example, grammar is not called grammar of something nor music music of something. If at all it is in virtue of the genus that these two are spoken of in relation to some-thing: grammar is called knowl-edge of something (not grammar of something). . . . Thus the particular cases are not relatives (1 la20-30). virtue of something else, such as knowledge which is spoken of in virtue of the known. But none of the individuals [of a given genus], that is, none of the particular cases [of a given universal], is spoken of in virtue of something else. For example, knowledge, [a genus], is called knowledge of something, but grammar, [a particular case], is not called grammar of something. This is so unless the particular case is set forth as the genus, that is, given the name of the universal, which in this case is knowledge— then, grammar would be called knowledge of something. Thus the particular cases are not relatives. ... The Jabirian text again appears with its own glosses and paraphrases. Note that Aristode, while speaking of gene, does not invoke the concept of universals (nor, correspondingly, does Ishaq). In contrast, the Jabirian author does speak of universals more than once. In this passage our text is quite distant from that of Ishaq who is consistently faithful and literal; for example, for sunkatarithmeisthai Ishaq has the literal rendering caddadna (Badawi ed., 37:5). The example of music is, likewise, faithfully reproduced in Ishaq; from our text it is missing. Moreover, if the same thing really is a qualification and a relative there is nothing absurd in its being counted in both the genera (1 la36-37). . . . and there is nothing absurd in a thing's falling under two different genera. Note that the first part of the sentence is missing from the Jabirian text; the second part is rather awkward, though it may appear smooth because I present it here in a rather free translation. Literally rendered, the Arabic text will read something like: \"and there is nothing absurd in a thing's"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"242 CHAPTER 6 falling in the genus in two different ways.\" Note that Ishaq's translation is utterly unlike ours and is quite elegant (Badawi ed., 37:16-17). [31] As we have already observed in Chapter I above, Jabir is somewhat inconsistent in his classification of substances. However, it should be noted that this inconsistency is not with regard to the principles of classification which remain thoroughly uniform throughout the corpus. These principles are clearly and systematically stated in the al^Khawass al-Kabir in which three kinds of substances are distinguished (qu. Kraus, II, [1942-3], pp. 18-20): (a) Spirits—those which completely volatilize in fire; (b) Metallic Bodies (ajsad)—those which are fusible, malleable, possess lustre, and produce a ringing sound; and (c) Bodies (ajsam)—mineral substances, not malleable, may be fusible, pulverizable. These are further subdivided into three groups: (cj) containing some quantity of spirit (e.g., mica); (C2) containing a very small quantity of spirit (e.g., shells); and (c3) containing no spirit (e.g., onyx). (For a detailed account of these principles see Kraus, op. cit., pp. 18-30). Jabir is teaching us that the difference between spirits and bodies does not lie in their color, hardness, or in the manner in which they undergo casting. Indeed, all natural substances, no matter from which of the three realms they were derived, contained both body as well as spirit. The question as to wherein lies the difference between bodies and spirits is taken up later in the text. TEXTUAL NOTES 1 At the end of the book Jabir does give illustrative calculations of the weights of the natures in spirits. 2 The point is repeated that if upon analysis of the name of the spirit the total weight of the natures is not found to be exactly 17 or its multiple, one augments/suppresses the natures. 3 Kr 71-73. COMMENTARY AND TEXTUAL NOTES 243 [32] By now we are familiar with Jabir's idea of external/internal natures. We have here a categorical statement that transmutation of natural objects consists in a direct interchange between the external and internal natures. One notes the further assertion that the elements of all things follow a circular pattern of change, something which, in all probability, the author derives from Aristotle (\"It is evident, therefore, that coming-to-be of simple bodies will be cyclical.\" Gen. et Corr., 2.4, 331 b2-3). [33] See Chapter 3 above where this passages have been cited and discussed. TEXTUAL NOTES 1 Kr 373. This work belongs to the Books of Balances. 2 Kr 51. This is the title of a lost treatise which is part of of the CXII collection. There is also a Kitab al-Mirrikh wa al-Shams (Book of Mars and the Sun) in the LXXcollection (Kr 189). [34] Abrupdy, Jabir introduces his curricular program for the disciple. But he does more than that, for in the middle of his discussion he digresses into a polemical attack against the doctrines of a group of people identified by him as the Sabians. Somewhat ironically, it is in the course of this side-stepping that he reveals to us some of the most interesting and essential principles of his cosmology. [A] In this section Jabir specifies several stages in his training program. His disciple was supposed to study the following subjects in the order given: (i) Alchemical Processes: Recognition of substances (ii) Cosmology: the Four Classes of Elements, Their Accidents and Their Qualities"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"244 CHAPTER 6 (iii) Philosophy: Sayings and Doctrines of Philosophers (iv) Kaldm, Logic, Arithmetic and Geometry: Selected Topics (v) (a) Science of the Natures (optional): Specific Properties of Things (b) Craft and Trickeries (optional): the Book of Trickeries (vi) Science of Balance: Balance of Fire and of Music; Balances of Metals (vii) Study of the Book of the Balance (viii) Alchemical Operations: Ceration, Coagulation, etc.; Opera-tions Concerning Elixirs TEXTUAL NOTES 1 For a detailed account of these chemical processes see Stapleton, Azo and Husain [1927]. 2 See note 6 below. 3 Note the distinction Jabir maintains between tabc and kayfiyya. 4 See Chapter 3 above. 5 Kr 1063. This work is not extant. 6 There are wo works in the Jabirian corpus with this title, Kr 197 and Kr 366. Both are lost. 7 A Book of the Seven is part of the LXX (Kr 132). Also found in the corpus is a collection of severs books, one on each of the seven rnetais (gold, silver, copper, iron, tin, lead, and khdrsini), and this is likewise referred to by the author as the Sabca (Kr 947-953). 8 A fuller discussion of these operations is in Stapleton, Azo and Husain [1927]. 9 Note the categorical statement that elixirs are only ideal substances and do not actually exist. IB] The first paragraph of this subsection is somewhat obscure. If everything has a Balance, why are we told now that the Balance comes about only after substances are mixed together? The second paragraph is largely clear but only if we assume that by equilibrium Jabir here means Balance, not what he meant in [23] (cf. the account of Jabir's Canon of Equilibrium in Chapter 3 above). COMMENTARY AND TEXTUAL NOTES 245 [35] Coincidentally, it was by examining the cosmological foundations of Jabir's Balance that we had begun our substantive study of his natural scientific system (Chapter 2 above), and this is precisely the subject on which our author now brings his book to a close. Thus, given that the cosmological discourse of this section has already been effectively and extensively discussed, it should now make an easy reading. While no attempt has been made to reach a definitive identification of the group of people Jabir is here attacking, it should be remarked that their alleged views make them seem like some Hellenized philosophers who derive their ideas largely, though not exclusively, from Aristotle. We are told that they postulate a unique and eternal prime matter, and that they explain the constitution of the entire natural world as having come into being through a temporal cosmological process. During this temporal process, the prime matter progressively acquired, first, three dimensions; then, primary qualities; and, finally, gave rise to the four elementary bodies. That Jabir is troubled by the idea of an abstract, imperceptible, unknowable and attributeless prime matter has already been examined at length in Chapter 2 above. But here he brings into focus another funda-mental feature of his cosmology. In fact, it is this feature which appears to be one of the most outstanding characteristics of his entire cosmologi-cal thought. As we have already seen, Jabir himself believes in an incorporeal sub-stance (jawhat•) \"which is in everything, and out of which everything arises.\" He also believes in some kind of a process whereby his substance becomes corporeal, attaches itself to the four qualities, and gives rise to the Empedoclean primary bodies (Chapter 2 above). But, then, this was not, according to Jabir, a temporal process. It was, rather, a description of the various hierarchical stages of the descent of material bodies. No building block of the natural world had a temporal priority over any of the others. Thus, one stage of the world was not replaced by another. Rather, like the steps of a ladder, all stages existed together in a hierarchy of an ontological plurality. The elements, and the things which are constituted out of these elements, had both come into being at the same instant, created by a single act of God (\"dafatan wahidatan see [4] above). This position has been explicitly stated in [A] below."},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"246 CHAPTER 6 In this way, Jabir distinguishes himself from his Sabians, and, indeed, from his Hellenistic predecessors in general. [A] This subsection has been quoted and discussed already in Chapter 2 above. (For the term tina, see n. 53 of that chapter). But here we particularly note Jabir's assertion that the elements of the material world (the four natures) and things which arose out of these elements (plants, animals and minerals) existed simultaneously. The world, we are told, did not temporally evolve to its present state; it has always been arranged and organized in the same way. Of course this did not mean that the natural world was static. Jabir's four natures were capable of entering into an unlimited number of different combinations, giving rise to the vast diversity of objects in the world. These objects perpetually changed, transformed into one another, or returned to their elements by being resolved into the natures which constituted them. These processes marked the natural world. TEXTUAL NOTES 1 Note the very rare application of the term kayfiyyat to primary qualities. [B] Continuing with his polemical attack, Jabir now tries to beat his Sabians at their own game. He points out that in terms of their own theory, these philosophers cannot consistently maintain that their hayula (= Gr. hule) is a unique entity (for a discussion of the term hayula see Chapter 2 above). Jabir demonstrates that if they are true to their own logic, these people will have to postulate as many hayulds as there are elements! One particular point of interest in this subsection is the way Jabir widens the concept of prime matter in order to give it a defined and concrete sense. fCJ The argument dismissing the uniqueness of prime matter continues. Jabir's Sabians here appear close to Aristotle, talking of prime matter as COMMENTARY AND TEXTUAL NOTES 247 the ultimate subject of properties in a body, itself admitting of no change but having the potentiality of accepting forms. But if prime matter had different potentialities, argues Jabir, then it cannot be unique for then it will admit of diversity in itself! During the course of his argument, Jabir side-steps into matters of detail. He rejects the claim that Water transforms into Fire without first transforming into Air. Somewhat ironically, this idea of an intermediate stage in the process of Water —> Fire transformation can legitimately be derived from Aristotle himself. We have already referred to Aristotle's statement that the four elements change into one another following a circular pattern ([32] above). The traditional schematic diagram of this circle has been reproduced below. Now, if we move in an anticlockwise direction starting with Water (cold and moist), the first stage of transformation is Air (hot and moist), involving the change only of one quality. Next, Air transforms into hot and dry Fire, again through the change only of one quality. This is perfectly consistent with, and is supported by, Aristotle's belief that elements having one quality in common (Air and Water) change quickly, whilst elements with no quality in common (Water and Fire) change slowly {Gen. et Corr., 4.2, 331a). Fire ID] As we have already observed in [A] above and elsewhere (see Arabic text in n. 59, \"Addenda to Notes,\" Chapter 2 above), Jabir believes that"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"248 CHAPTER 6 things ultimately resolve back, or return to, their elements. He finds no difficulty in maintaining this doctrine, for if returning to constituent elements meant annihilation, so be it—the world was not going to last for ever anyway. [E] It is clear that Jabir is here attacking the abstract notion of the four natures, which, upon his account, the Sabians seem to espouse. To him such a notion is elusive. Thus, invoking the authority of the \"majority of philosophers,\" Jabir claims that the four natures exist either potentially in one another, or they are found in the elements which they constitute. In other words, the natures had concrete existence, and to postulate that they exist in any other way was nonsense. Given the context, this \"other way\" evidendy refers to the abstract way of his Sabians. The doctrine that natures exist potentially in one another is a very interesting one, but it makes an appearance as an isolated thought, for Jabir neither elaborates on it here, nor does he bring it up anywhere else in his cosmological discourses in our text. Thus, a philosophical commentary on this doctrine is unwarranted. IF] This passage has been quoted and discussed in Chapter 2 above. [G] Finally, Jabir declares the core doctrine of his entire system: The four natures constitute the fundamental principle of the natural world. J [36] After a long digression, Jabir now returns to the subject of his training program. Much like the present-day practices, his disciple is required to present his ideas before an audience, both verbally and in writing. This was the final stage of training after which the disciple could in principle be called a philosopher.
