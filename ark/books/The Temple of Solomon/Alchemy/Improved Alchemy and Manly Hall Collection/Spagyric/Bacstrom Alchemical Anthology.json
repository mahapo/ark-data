SIGISMOND BACSTROM, M.D., flourished towards the latter part of the eighteenth and the beginning of the nineteenth centuries. He was, evidently, of Scandinavian origin, judging by his name, and certainly, for a part of his life, he was a ship’s surgeon. As some doubt is cast upon this fact by A.E. Waite in The Brotherhood of the Rosy Cross, the following extract will confirm it. In a publication entitled Voyages and Travels, in all Parts of the World, by John Pinkerton, Vol. 1, 1803. Published: Longman, Hurst, Rees, and Orme, Paternoster Row, there appears: “An account of a voyage to Spitzbergen in the year 1780, by S. Bacstrom, M.D., communicated by the author to the editor of the Philosophical Magazine, July 1799. “Such has been my passion to visit foreign climes, that I have been no less then fifteen voyages, one of them round the world. “I engaged myself as surgeon on board the Rising Sun, William Souter, Master --- a well appointed stout ship of 400 tons burthen”. None of Bacstrom’s alchemical works was ever published by himself, although H.P. Blavatsky, in Lucifer (a Theosophical monthly magazine) commenced the publication, in serial form, in February 1891, of a book entitled: “The Golden Chain of Homerus, that is: a description of nature and natural things. How and from what they are generated, and how they are destroyed again, and what tha subject is which generates, destroys and regenerates things. 5"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":" “Frankfurt and Leipzic, 1723, translated from the German by Sigismond Bacstrom, M.D., 1797.” The publication of the installments was discontinued owing, probably, to the death of Blavatsky which occurred at about that time. Interest in Bacstrom derives from his account of an extraordinary happening which occurred to him when he was in the Island of Mauretius, he being, at that time, the doctor on the ship Harriet under Captain Daddy, bound for New York. According to his own account, whilst in Port Louis, he met with a French doctor by the name of Petit Radel who had fled from France during the Revolution. Dr Radel introduced Bacstrom to Comte Louis de Chazal, and de Chazal very promptly initiated Bacstrom into a Societas Rosae Crucis, administering the appropriate oath of allegiance, issuing a certificate of Membership and certifying as follows: “I have initiated and received Mr Sigismond Bacstrom, Doctor of Physic, as a practical member and Brother, above an Apprentice, in consequence of his solid learning, which I certify by my name and seal: Mauritius, 12 Sept. 1794, De Chazal, F.R.C.” There are two very good reasons for this initiation; the first is given in Bacstrom;s account of the incident in which he writes: “As he” [the Comte] “perceived by frequent conversation when we were alone... walking in his extensive gardens, or alone together in the library, that I knew the theory of the Lapis Philosophorum, and was well acquainted with the classic authors, he initiated me and communicated to me his practical labours, and I wrote down from his mouth the whole procedure of the Lapis Animalis as he had worked it”. 6"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":" The second reason springs from the well-known tradition amongst the Rosicrucians who always strove to initiate “a son” into the mysteries before passing to the Great Beyond, in order to preserve the continuity of the Order and the knowledge it possessed. This desire finds expression in the fourth Clause of the Obligation as follows: “I do hereby promise that I will instruct, for the benefit of good men, before I depart this life, one, or two persons at most, in our secret knowledge, and initiate and receive such persons as a member apprentice into our Society, in the same manner as I have been initiated and received; but such person only as I believe to be truly worthy and of an upright well meaning mind, blameless conduct, sober life and desirous of knowledge”. The Comte de Chazal died in 1795, at the age of 97 years, the year following Bacstrom’s Initiation. Perhaps, it was due to a foreknowledge of his approaching end that prompted the Comte’s desire to work the process again from the beginning, for the instruction and benefit of his new disciple, but such was not to be, for we learn from Bacstrom: “He offered me 30,000 Spanish dollars if I would stay with him one year to work the process once more from the beginning, but having already received orders from the President of the Colonial Assembly (i.e., the sanculotte Government of the Island) to go on board the Harriet bound for New York, I durst not stay, and when the worthy old man heard that of me, he wept like a child”. In a letter written to Alexander Tilloch, dated 16 March 1804, Bacstrom gives some interesting information about Comte Louis de Chazal. He was the most sensible, learned, and opulent man on the Island. He possessed the power of observing events at a distance, and recorded in a journal everything that went on in Paris at the time of the French Revolution, although physical communication between France and Mauritius was completely cut off at that period. 7"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":" He kept records of his magical experiments and the cures he had effected by means of animal magnetism, electricity, galvanism, etc., which were attested by the most respectable people on the Island. He had a rich collection of gold medals, precious stones, crude, ct, and set. His library contained more than one thousand volumes in all languages, and he possessed a laboratory and apparatus including astronomical and mathematical instruments. He had obtained the Lapis Philosophorum and the Pierre Animale. By the first he acquired what he possessed and by the second, which he always carried on his person when making magical experiments, he preserved his health to the age of 97. Permitting Bacstrom to handle the substances, he performed the transmutation of quicksilver into gold. He told Bacstrom that he had succeeded in making the Philosopher’ Stone at his first attempt in the second year after his arrival at Port Louis, agreeable to the instructions he had received in Paris in the year 1740, and that he would find Elias Ashmole’s Theatrum Chemicum Britannicum a great assistance. Such are some of the particulars which Bacstrom gives of his Master in Alchemy. The above information was published by the late Arthur Edward Waite, partly in his book entitled The Real History of the Rosicrucians, in 1887 and partly in The Brotherhood of the Rosy Cross, in 1924. The present writer has other sources of information, viz., some of the manuscripts to which Mr Waite refers as being jealously guarded in Theosophical hands. It is certain that Bacstrom resided in London and probable that his letter to Alexander Tilloch was written from there. Bacstrom has left the details of some discussions he had with 8"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"a certain Mr Ford, who was interested in Hermetic subjects, these notes being dated from Mary-le-Bone, 8 April 1805. There is also the record of a “second conversation with Mr Ford when he was at my house and drank tea with us on Good Friday, April 1805”. Bacstrom translated many treatises on Alchemy from German, French, and Latin, into English, usually with his own comments interspersed as he went along with his text. It appears that these translations were circulated to his friends or, perhaps, to a group of students which he probably had around him, because the manuscripts were copied by different people. Many of the manuscripts and the copies have survived to the present day. Bacstrom himself wrote a fair round English hand of the period. Many of his papers are at present in the United States. There is one complete Ms. of his which was evidently designed along the lines of Fasciculus Chemicus by Arthur Dee (a son of the famous Dr John Dee), published by Elias Ashmole, which may have served Bacstrom as an example to follow. Bacstrom’s work is entitled “Essay on Alchemy by Sigismond Bacstrom, together with extracts from the great early Alchemists”. This is the book now offered to the public in honour of this worthy student of the occult, whose labours have never been recognized except by the few who had the good fortune to come under his personal influence, or to derive assistance from his written manuscripts. We have taken the liberty to change the name and now present the work under the title of: Bacstrom’s Alchemical Anthology It is interesting to speculate upon the source of de Chazal’s information. Bacstrom tells us that he learned from the Comte that he [the Comte] has received instruction from Paris in 1740. The Comte de St Germain was very active in European countries at that time, and his immense work for Masonry and in Mystical societies is known and recognized. 9"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"He was undoubtedly the last of the great Masters of Alchemy to be seen in Europe, and the probability is that in 1740 he was actively connected with the Rosicrucian Lodge or Society, into which de Chazal was introduced in the same manner in which he afterwards received Bacstrom. Startling developments were taking place in chemistry when Bacstrom was alive. The discovery of oxygen by Priestley in 1774 caused chemists to change their opinion on the theory of the fire element in nature which had been held for thousands of years, and was the basis upon which all the old fire philosophers had worked. Now, with the demonstrated isolation of oxygen, the universe had become much more tangible, much more materialistic. The atomic theory followed in 1808, and Alchemy finally gave place to modern chemistry, “the wise daughter of a foolish mother”, in the view of contemporary chemists. That Bacstrom was not altogether happy about the new developments is indicated in a comment he wrote at the time as follows: “...if you reason and reflect upon the stupendous effects and power of the corporified fire or universal agent of God and Nature; the more you consider and reason upon it, the more you will be convinced that it must be so and can be no otherwise. Depend on it, modern chemistry will gradually be obliged to return to this truth known in primitive ages. “(1) Omnipresent, invisible, tranquil, unmanifested, universal agent, contained in the flint and steel and surrounding air, by night as well as by day, filling boundless space, in every atom of matter and space. “(2) Manifested in light by electrical motion, by the Sun and fixed stars or suns and by comets, likewise by electrical machines, by the diamond in the dark, by friction, by the flint and steel, and further, by concentration, manifest in warmth and heat. 10"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":" “(3) By further agitation and circular motion, manifested in burning flame of fire; as we find by burning glasses and by the flint and steel, but the omnipresent universal agent, the unmanifested tranquil fire must not be withdrawn but must be admitted to feed or support the fire, and it must be supplied with a subject to act upon, i.e., fuel, or else it returns to its first omnipresent state of universality, from when nevertheless, it may be remanifested by motion, by the electrical machine, or, by the flint and steel, or by any other suitable motion or action, in straight lines, by friction, or by hammering, or by circular motion. That principle will reappear everywhere, provided it is not excluded by excluding atmospheric AIR (and it is manifested in heat, in fire, or in fire and light. This is the vital principle that animates atmospheric air) in the character of spiritual or incorporeal nitre, by Sendivogius called the nitre of the philosophers, and by the moderns called oxygen. When extended in humidity it becomes universal aerial acid and when it meets with a suitable magnet, it becomes corporified nitre”. In ancient civilizations, e.g., Ancient Egypt, all scientific knowledge was confined to the priesthood and the temples. Doubtless they arrived at the necessity for secrecy, by a realization that knowledge, in the hands of those who have no high code of conduct, is highly dangerous to the individual and the state. It is known that the Egyptian civilization was of long duration, and there is little doubt that the priests and rulers of that land were mighty men of magic and science. Moses profited by their teaching: he never betrayed it, but used it to promote a similar culture amongst the Hebrews. These arts, embraced in the Kabbalah, were as jealously guarded amongst the Jews as they were amongst the Egyptians. Let it be noted that the philosophy of the Egyptians and the Jews, was based upon the conception of a spiritual as well as a physical universe --- “as above, so below”. They recognized a spiritual power in the universe of which the physical world was merely the transient husk. They 11"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"regarded man also, as a Spirit, temporarily the prisoner in a house of flesh. Furthermore, they knew how to bridge the consciousness between the spiritual states and the physical waking awareness. It is possible that modern discoveries along materialistic lines will make it necessary for scientific knowledge to be secretly guarded, as being too dangerous for indiscriminate dissemination, in fact, Governments are already preventing the customary interchange of knowledge amongst scientists themselves --- scientific secrets have become official secrets. Perhaps, this is a step towards a reversion to old customs, and young men will be sworn to secrecy before their scientific instruction begins. Experiments with radioactive substances have indicated to the modern investigators, that certain metals are undergoing a process of transmutation in nature, which can be observed. The despised fire in nature of the Alchemists is intruding itself upon the notice of the moderns. Here is the solar electric force on its way out of manifestation. Chemists know of the cycle in atmospheric changes which causes nitre to ascend and descend constantly, thereby forming the food upon which the flora thrives: is it not possible, probable, and even certain, that, in the light of modern investigation, the metallic kingdom is subject to the same kind of metamorphosis, although the cycles are much longer. To the Alchemists the idea was completely rational. As Bacstrom remarks in his admirable preface, they sought “the cause of the cause” and let it be remarked, they were deeply spiritual men who approached the Throne of Grace at the commencement of all their labours. The Alchemists observed the beginning of the metallic cycle in nature of which the modern chemists are witnessing the end. A recent example of the old school was Dr R.W. Councell, M.D., who wrote an admirable textbook on the subject entitled Apologia Alchymiae which can safely be recommended to those who seek an introduction to the hermetic arts, Although this wise 12"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"doctor performed some experiments in his laboratory, his life was cut short by death before he succeeded in his quest. H. P. Blavatsky once addressed an open letter to the “Gentlemen of the French Academie” entitled “Alchemy in the Nineteenth Century” from which the following excerpts are illuminating: “Let us compare the Chinese system with that which is called Hermetic Science. The twofold object which both Schools aim at is identical; the making of gold and the rejuvenating and prolonging of human life by means of the menstruum universal and lapis philosophorum. The third object or true meaning of the ‘transmutation’ has been completely neglected by Christian Adepts; for being satisfied with their belief in the immortality of the soul, the adherents of the older Alchemists have never properly understood this question. Now, partly through negligence, partly through habit, it has been completely struck out of the summum bonum sought for by the Alchemists of Christian countries. Nevertheless it is only this last of the three objects which interests the real Oriental Alchemists. All initiated adepts despising gold, and having a profound indifference to life, cared very little for the first two. “Both these Schools recognize the existence of two elixirs: the great and the small one. The use of the second on the physical plane transmutes metals and restores youth. The great Elixir, which was only symbolically an elixir, conferred the greatest boon of all: the immortality of consciousness in the spirit, the Nirvana which, in the sequence of evolution, precedes Para-Nirvana, or absolute union with the One Essence. “The principles which form the basis of the two systems are also identical, that is to say: the compound nature of the metals pass back to their basic elements. 13"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":" “Both Schools of Alchemy are closely allied to astrology and magic. “They both make use of a fantastic phraseology. In his Magie Naturalle Baptista Porta tells us this clearly: ‘I do not promise you mountains of gold nor the philosophers’ stone, nor even that golden liquor which renders immortal him who drinks it... all that is only visionary; for the world being mutable and subject to change, all that it produces must be destroyed’. “In other words, this stone contains: the secret of the transmutation of metals, that of long life, and of CONSCIOUS IMMORTALITY. \"Outside of the Schools of Adepts, almost unapproachable for Western students, there does not exist in the whole world, and more especially in Europe, one single work on Occultism, and above all on Alchemy, which is written in clear and precise language, or which offers to the public a system or a method which could be followed as in the physical sciences. All treatises which come from an Initiate or from an Adept, Ancient or Modern, unable to reveal all, limit themselves to throwing light on certain problems which are allowed to be disclosed to those worthy of knowing, while remaining at the same time hidden from those who are unworthy of receiving the truth, for fear they should make a selfish use of their knowledge”. We should pay some attention to the learned of the Middle Ages, for by the Hermetic Arts the old Alchemists claimed to have produced a wonderful medicine for human beings, which would restore frail bodies to perfect health and preserve that health until the final inevitable dissolution. This medicine known to them as Aurum Potabile was derived from a metalline base, but many philosophers hint that their base was not always the gold of the mine, but another, more crude, substance which nevertheless in the evolutionary process becomes gold is left to Nature and her Archaeus. 14"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":" Some of the philosophers say they used gold as the basis for their work, but they first reduced it to a sulphur by dissolving it, which is said to be a slow process and made the work almost interminable. It is described as being reserved for the Grandees of the Earth. The medicine was known to the Arabs as Elixir, and to the Greeks as the Ambrosia and Nectar of the Gods. The Romans also knew of it and borrowed these names from the Greeks. In India it is still called Soma Juice or the Juice of the Moon, and in China it is known as the Golden Pill. This is the lost secret of Medicine, the reward of a properly prepared person who dares to seek it, or to supplicate it at the hand of the Most High. Pearls are never cast before swine, nor will the unprepared ever safely pass the door which divides the profane from the Occult, The penalty has always been death, for this medicine, when elaborated, can as easily poison as heal, and it is as well to know it in the beginning. Following the publication of John Dee’s Hieroglyphic Monad and the Epistles of Ali Puli, this work by Dr Bacstrom, M.D., is now submitted for consideration by those interested in Alchemy.

Hamilton-Jones London, February 1960. 15"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":" 16"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":" PREFACE The following extracts selected from numerous authors, contain a full elucidation of the hidden art on which so many thousand volumes have been written. The writings of these Philosophers, as they call themselves, and many of them were well entitled to that appellation, are for the greater part, indeed we may say all of them, written with studied ambiguity, to conceal the art, a disclosure of which, they were persuaded, could not fail to prove prejudicial to mankind, though eventually it would be far otherwise. The obscurity, however, which pervades their writings, ought not to be wholly ascribed to their wishes to conceal their knowledge. It is true that much of it may be attributed to that love of mystery which held the diffusion of knowledge to be impious and wicked because, forsooth, a bad use of it might be made by bad and impious men; and it is equally true that the fables and metaphors they made use of in the communication of that portion they were willing to communicate were often so ill chosen, so absurd, inapplicable and contradictory, that no person, but the one who had the ingenuity to devise them, could ever comprehend what they were intended to convey --- but the principal cause of the veil that covers these writings, continuing so impenetrable, is the change, the happy change, that Philosophy has undergone, since the dark ages, which has tended to render writings, that in themselves were obscure even to the philosophers of the time, who yet, had a perfect knowledge of the systems of the day, almost incomprehensible to those who make themselves acquainted only with the modern systems. The Ancients pretended to much more knowledge than the Moderns lay claim to. The knowledge that certain invariable effects followed certain causes was not enough in their eyes: 17"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"the cause of the cause was also to be explained! Nor was this difficult with men who were allowed to make whatever use of words might best suit their dogmas. When they had traced effects to their causes, through as many links as they were able, they always came to first principles and elements, and these were invariably the same! --- whatever was the subject on which they treated! The most ancient first principles were Sulphur and Mercury, and to these in process of time was added Salt; but all and each of these were composed of the four elements, Fire, Air, Earth, and Water! The former, as employed by the Sophi, were mere terms of art, and very often had no relation whatever to the substances now known by these names. They were generic terms for certain principles predominating or supposed to predominate, in the subject of which they treated --- a kind of Proteus to which they could give any shape, and by which they explained to their own satisfaction at least, the most intricate operations of Nature. Hence not only minerals, but vegetables and animals were all composed of the same principles; salt, sulphur, and mercury! Nor was this a difficult thing to comprehend when once the disciple made himself acquainted with the powers of Archaeus, the workman employed by Nature in all her operations! It is true these Philosophers often disagreed in their detail of these intricate operations, but as all of them landed in the same elements, they were all sound at bottom and in general were perfectly satisfied with each other! But however defective their philosophy might be, certain it is their knowledge in some particulars went far beyond what the moderns, with all their advantages, can pretend to lay claim to. Their prime and grand Arcanum was the Philosophers’ Stone --- a secret which they concealed with much care, and which yet they were anxious should be discovered by a few, from their writings. And the only wonder is that it has not, long ere now, become as common as any other art. Their claim to this knowledge is not allowed by the moderns, but those who deny it cannot have examined the evidence with sufficient care: indeed many who talk most 18"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"confidently on this topic are by no means qualified to give an opinion of the smallest weight, on the question, and in fact are much less entitled to be considered Philosophers than those ancients whom they affect to despise. A slight cursory reading of a few of the Authors, who have written on this art, will not enable any inquirer to discover where harmony exists among them; much less will it enable him to reconcile differences which arise from the different ways in which they have respectively chosen to handle their subject. His knowledge cannot be acquired in a few months, no, nor even in a few years --- and yet when once it is acquired it may be communicated to another, who has made himself a little acquainted with the old philosophers, in a few hours. The great difficulty in reading their writings is to distinguish between their abstract, ideal principles, and those which are corporeal, tangible, and actually employed in the work. The most candid among them admit, without any disguise. That though they talk so much about the elements, meaning the four elements, that with them the Artist hath nothing to do. He must leave Nature to work with these as she pleases; nor need he trouble himself with making the principles; salt, sulphur, and mercury, but take such as nature will provide him with, ready made. What then are the substances which the Alchemists employed as their mercury, sulphur, and salt? It is true that what one makes to be his mercury another puts for his salt; that in their mode of Philosophizing they are often put one for another; and that all of them are given innumerable names and to each of them often the same name --- but it is equally true that however various the appellations are that are given to them, each of them are described, times innumerable, by their own proper characters and properties, in the writings of the Philosophers; and that in number they are but three answerable to the three principles --- held by the ancients to be the first products of their four elements. It is true it is called “one thing”, “two”, three”, “four”, and “five”, but these expressions, are mere quibbles, intended not merely to puzzle the ignorant, but to 19"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"surprise the Adepts who might chance to see the work; for many wrote on this art, more for the purpose of showing to others who possessed the secret, that the author also knew it, than from any desire to communicate knowledge to the ignorant --- and what is worse, many wrote and published books who knew nothing whatever of the subject. The passages selected for the following pages are such as relate most directly to the three principles or materials, the Furnace and Vessel, the work itself and signs which accompany it, and multiplication and transmutation. The remarks included between crochets [in this manner] are no part of the text of the Authors quoted, but are introduced as helps to explain the passages in which they occur. Part I. The first principle, the ground work and foundation of the whole art is Gold --- common pure gold, without any ambiguity or double meaning. This is “Our Sulphur”. Part II. The second is Mercury, not common quicksilver, however, but that substance to which the Philosophers have given the name of “Our Mercury”, “Our Diana”, “Our Moon”, “Our Luna”, “Unripe Gold”, and many other names. Part III. The third is what they call their “Secret Fire”, “Our Mercurial Water”, “Dissolving Water”, “Fire against Nature”, Spirit of Life”, “The Moon”, “The Priest”, etc. The first being well purified, and the second properly prepared, they are then joined together, and the compound which is called Rebis is then reduced to powder and mixed with the third. Thus are all the three principles united in proper proportion. Selections respecting the union of the former, form Part IV in the following pages --- Part V consists of selections respecting the union of the three principles --- Part VI of the furnace and vessel in which the matter is digested or concocted. 20"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":" Part VII is passages which more or less include all the former, but are more full as to the mode of procedure and the effects that follow.

All agree that the sulphur of the Philosophers comes out of gold. This is the foundation of their universal medicine: this is the little golden book which Trevisan says he won [discovered] with great soul-labouring, and which dropped out of his hands into the fountain, after which he saw it no more... The King alone enters the fountain [the Regulus of Antimony and Mars when rebis is made], out of which he received his beginning and essence in the mines... This is the rose-coloured blood of the lion which, according to the Turba, must be united with the gluten of the Eagle. Vade Mecum Philosophicum By “the Root” Count Bernard Trevisan means the same that Ripley does by “the basis of the work”; namely, the mature sulphur, which is in gold, perfectly digested... This root is the chiefest principle in our work... It is so called because it has the effect to introduce perfection or determination, and brings the other principles to its own perfection. Therefore it is denominated by Ripley “the Fire of Nature” and “the Father of the third menstruum”, and not without reason; for this one principle determinates and glorified the two other principles. Augurellus Seek not the principles of Gold any where else; for in Gold is the seed of Gold: though being close shut up it retires deep and is to be sought by us with tedious labour. Raymund Lully Two [metals] are more pure than the rest, namely, gold and silver, without which the work cannot be begun or finished; because in them is the purest substance of sulphur, perfectly united by the ingenuity of Nature.

Alanus He that knows not how to extract the soul from the body of Gold or of Silver, and to return it to the body wholly deviates from the right path.

Nodus Sophicus Enodatus Attend carefully to the weight, as it is of much consequence. A correct proportion must be observed in the conjunction of the mercurial essence of the Philosophers. The ancient Arabian possessors of the Stone say thus: The weight of the Male [gold] must be singular [1 part], but that of the female plural [2 parts]. Take care that the woman [Regulus of Antimony and Mars] does not dominate over the man, nor let the husband be too powerful over the wife --- permit not the Aqua resolvens [the dry mercurial water, or secret Fire] be too deep [i.e., too large in quantity for the other two], that the seed or sperm [Gold in rebis] be not drowned.

The remote, the four elements, out of which God only can create anything. Relinquish then the [primary] elements, for thou canst make nothing of them but only these three principles. Nor can Nature herself make anything else out of them. As thou canst produce nothing but these three principles, why labour foolishly to produce from the elements what you may find made ready to your hand by Nature. Be satisfied therefore with the three principles out of which Nature produces all things in and upon the earth... mineral... vegetable... and animal. In the animal Kingdom the body, spirit, and soul, bear a special resemblance to the work of the Philosophers. The body is earth [answerable to the Regulus of Antimony and Mars]; the spirit is the water [our mercurial water or secret Fire], and the soul is fire, or sulphur of Gold. The spirit increases the bulk of the body, but the fire is its virtue. And as there is more of the spirit in weight than there is of the Fire, the Spirit exerteth itself and overpowers the Fire and draws it to itself, and so each of them increaseth in virtue, while the earth, which is the medium between them, is increased in weight.

This artificial heat must not be violent, but soft and gentle, only able to act on the most subtil particles, to raise and mix them, until the whole composition be broken, divided without any manual separation, and converted into perfect blackness. Pontanus Put it on the fire [i.e., in the furnace], with such a proportion of heat as shall only excite or stir up the matter, and in a short time that fire [the secret sophic Fire] will complete the whole work. Radix Chymiae The putrefaction of the body is the beginning of the work, and is effected by a gentle heat, so that nothing may ascend in the horse dung, i.e., in our mercury. [The solution effected by the secret internal fire he here calls horse dung; but the gentle heat mentioned is that which is applied externally]. Johan De Monte Snyder You must be particularly careful about the government of the fire, which must constantly remain in its right degree and must never cease; for if the natural heat should fail, your work will die, and an immature birth will follow, and that which is immature can only work according to its own nature. 71"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"Incertus Macrocosmus When you have put the genuine matter in its proper vessel it then requires only a natural heat, so arranged that the external heat may not surpass the internal but only excite it to action. If the heat is too great no alteration can possibly take place. A great heat can only destroy and burn the matter so that nothing useful can come out of it. On the other hand if your heat is too small the materials will be dried up and become hard. The metallic spirits will be dormant and inactive, and cannot operate if not excited [by an external heat] and vivified by a living [internal] fire. As this is of great importance the Artist must be careful not to commit an error in this point, otherwise he will do nothing. Water Stone of the Wise Put a small fire under it [the glass] to excite the internal heat, as Pontanus says, as a child must be in a natural animal heat in the mother’s womb. Take care, through the whole work, that you do not increase you heat too much, especially during putrefaction; because, during putrefaction, the internal natural power begins to subtilize the body. Therefore to preserve the internal heat of the bodies from injury be careful, especially during putrefaction to keep a gentle heat. Johannes De Padua Be careful not to make your fire too strong. This would cause the Matter to sublime and would destroy the work. Notice what I say: if you make your fire gentle and govern it prudently that it may not exceed the internal heat [of the secret Fire] you will be certain to bring your work to perfection. Observe then! As soon as the internal heat of your matter or of the body by feeling the power of the external heat 72"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"awakeneth and begins to act, the matter has then heat enough to operate perfectly, conformably to her own nature, and without doubt, to produce its fruit by the power of Nature within. Even if you have made the work ten times before, be not too bold with your heat, but govern it with care, or your work will be destroyed. H. Von Batsdorff The natural or external heat must cause the internal to awaken and to operate. The external heat must not, by too much violence, surpass the internal, or all your labour will be in vain. Eyraeneus Philaletha As the Stone is compared to a man, and its first humid regimen to a bath, therefore make the first degree of heat pleasant, gentle, like a hot bath for a naked person --- which is a lower degree of heat than he can bear, and causes but a gentle sweat. The second degree is a little higher, whereby a copious perspiration would be induced, and this is as hot as a man can bear it. The third degree is so much hotter as to cause a hissing and bubbling and cannot be borne long by the hand; for our composed work in this degree of heat rises in bubbles, which fall down again, rising and falling continually. The fourth and last degree of heat, which brings dryness, cannot be borne by the fingers without burning them.

The third is the warm and dry summer. The fourth, Autumn, is the harvest or time for reaping our fruit. The heat of the first regimen must be like that of a hen sitting over eggs to hatch chickens; or similar to the heat in our stomachs which digests our food. This heat continues until blackness --- it may even be continued until the matter is changed into Whiteness; but if this heat is transgressed and the matter be kept too hot, you will never obtain the wished for Raven’s head, but either a sudden transient redness, or a red oily matter swimming on the superficies.

[The degree of heat now spoken of is merely comparative. If his winter heat is equal to that of a hen’s on eggs when hatching them, his spring heat must have a proportional increase of temperature. This remark applies equally to what follows]: When the Stone is perfectly dry the fire must be increased again, answerable to the increase of the sun’s heat when he passes into Leo. Johannes De Padua In the beginning of the work the first degree of heat must not be higher than the warmth of a sitting hen. In the middle of your stove you must make a door which you can open and shut, so that you can feel in the pot how quick or how gentle your heat is. Let it be such that when you touch the pot your hand may feel pleasantly warm. Attend to what I say or you will greatly damage the work. Take care, above all things, not quickly or rashly to increase your heat; for if you make your fire too intense and the external heat shall overpower and conquer the internal heat of the materials, the body would retain the spirit; or else the spirit will sublime, and especially in the end, when the body is converted into a Spirit: therefore be attentive in governing the fire rightly, or you will destroy your work.

Place it in ashes, or in sand, and administer the first degree of heat --- such a heat, that, without burning your hand, you may be able to suffer it to rest on the ashes or sand, or on the upper part of the neck of the glass. Keep it in this heat, without moving or disturbing it, until complete blackness and various colours appear, and whiteness follows. It is of great moment that you do not hurry your work and burn up the matter by too much heat... Be careful of your fire that it be not too strong... you ought to have blackness with such a heat that you can hardly bear your fingers on the glass, and yet can bear the heat without burning them. This regimen must be continued till you have gone through perfect blackness into dryness, and until the matter is become snow or silver white and fixed, and the Queen is born. This is obtained by one and the same linear heat.

Although the work for both is the same, yet there is a difference in the paradise water to be noticed. The paradise water for the White is extracted from Luna, that wherewith the Red stone is imbibed and multiplied must be extracted from Sol --- otherwise it is the same labour, but the white and red cannot be multiplied by the same degree of heat. Incertus Macrocosmus In the first degree the Stone is called Adrop, Philosophical Lead, Antimony [being in truth Antimony], etc. In the second degree [when the secret Fire is joined to rebis and action and reaction follow], it is called Sal Alcali, our Sal Armoniac, ashes of ashes, and sulphur of sulphur. When it is become water it is Azoth, when white it is called arsenic and lac virginis, when red it is called blood, red sulphur, etc. When it is sharp it is called vitriol, alum, nitre: when the Stone has been dissolved into water, it is called white running water, when sublimed and white it is called air, and when red it is called fire.

The first two must be produced by a very slow heat, which must be increased very gently. Eyraeneus Philaletha We have three conjunctions... The first is th amalgamation of gold with our Mercury... The compound is called rebis... In this there are two natures, the one more active, which is the mercury, the other more passive, which is gold. The activity of the mercury above the Gold is because the moving virtue of Sol is sealed, that is, his Sulphur is imprisoned.... These two must be mixed... this is a manual work, and the last manual work next to putting and sealing of it in the egg, that thou hast, before thou hast attained the first degree of the mastery. The next conjunction in order is when thou has administered and regulated [in due proportion] thy fire [the secret Fire] that thy spirits shall so ascend and circulate until they have extracted out of the fixed body [Gold] its most digested virtue, or subtile soul, which is sulphurous, or of great fieriness [The Gold is called the soul, the sulphur, the fire of Nature]. When dissolution is made, Sol then is most active, and mercury more passive; mercury then is as it were the feminine sperm, which being more crude and tender is sooner wrought upon by the [secret] fire, which Sol, the masculine sperm, feels not till it be penetrated by the mercury [Regulus of Antimony and Mars] and then it is forced to send forth its seed; for the formal principle resides mostly in the gold, and the material chiefly in the water [Regulus of Antimony and Mars] and then it is forced to send forth its seed; for the formal principle resides mostly in the gold, and the material chiefly in the water [Regulus of Antimony and Mars].

So then by mediation of the soul [the solar principle derived from Mars and Sol] the spirit is made one and incorporated with the body [of the ripe and unripe Gold]; for the soul being by the spirit drawn from the body, doth naturally desire to be united with it again, and so long as it is from it, it is from home as it were on a pilgrimage. The body also naturally doth desire its soul and will as forcibly attract it as a lodestone iron... But this conjunction doth not retain the volatility of the compound though it is so united that the parts ascend and descend together...At length not only these parts, but their elemental qualities, are so strongly permixt that the one doth not more in acting than the other doth in reisting, by which means they are not only united to follow one another, but fixt to abide fire together.

He who arrives here may sit down at the banquet with the Sun and Moon. This is the so highly commended Stone of the Wise. The Same Without putrefaction you may not expect to reap fruit from your labor... The cause of this death, or corruption or rottenness [which takes place in the subject in the glass during the third conjunction] proceeds from the action of continual heat, not so much of the external fire of the Athanor, as of the compound within itself; in which the fire against nature [the secret Fire] doth open the perfect body [Gold] by continual contrition and decoction, and so lets loose its sulphur... which is fire of Nature; so that between these two in continual action and passion, together with the external heat continually acting, the whole compound is 85"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"brought to corruption. The external heat doth sublime the moisture, which again of its own accord returns continually, and doth moisten the earth so long, until by reason of the heat it have drunk up the moisture wholly, and then it dies. Unless you see this rotting of thy compound, which is done in a black color, with a stinking odour and a discontinuity of parts thy labour will be in vain. You cannot expect to have a new form brought in till the old be corrupted and put off. Gold and Mercury are two such principles that they will for ever delude those who work with tem in a sophistical way [amalgamating Gold wit common quicksilver]. They will remain the same to the end of the world unless pure gold be mixed [in rebis] with its own pure and appropriated mercury [the Regulus of Antimony and Mars] and set in a de heat of digestion [the digesting heat of the secret Fire]; a mutual action and passion will then rise between them, which, without the laying on of hands by the artist, will tend to a new generation. For in a convenient fire [the secret Fire assisted by external heat] in which the compound may perpetually and incessantly boil, and the subtile parts ascend and circulate upon the gross without intermission, the most digested virtue or soul of the fixed body [Gold] which is his basis of tincture will be extracted by the water [the Azoth or solar Butyrum Antimonii] and this will mix itself with the pure spirit [furnished by the secret Fire] of the water and with this it will ascend and return, until a total separation be made of the pure from the impure and the subtile from the gross.

Incertus The disposition that precedes putrefaction is of great moment. Its unerring sign is perfect blackness. In every labour it is the sulphur that causes blackness, and this in our Art and in the matter is the digestive power, which blackens of necessity.

Gold tinges not farther than its own body until its occult inward fire or anima be extracted out of its fixed body and the gold be made spiritual and volatile. Our living water therefore [i.e., our secret Fire] is a fire which burns, breaks and mortifies the gold more than elementary fire; and the more the gold is mixed with our living water and scoured therewith, in a gentle heat, the more is it torn asunder, centrally opened and attenuated by our fiery living water. When the gold shall have been sufficiently triturated and made one thing with our living water, then it contains within itself the fire-bearing [or fire-abiding] tincture. After you have tinged the body by the spirit, then the body tinges, and is full of tincture and yields tincture.

The reason is, because our body, prepare it how you will, cannot acquire more fusibility by its own power, than what is proper to it; nor can the spirit, prepare it how you may, be altered from its own volatile nature, nor be perfectly fixed without the mediation of the body; for it is indispensably requisite that the medicine or tincture be made fusible, living, tinging, and permanent in the strongest fire; which requires for its accomplishment an equality of the elements; and to a certainty this equality or harmony of the elements can never be obtained without a conjunction of the body [rebis] and the spirit [secret Fire], for by their union both concur to this end, and the body is spiritualized at the same time that the spirit is corporified and fixed. Clangor Buccinae Take the black earth [rebis] finely triturated, and imbibe it with mercury [viz., our secret Fire], and place it in warm ashes to dry up. Repeat this imbibing a second, third, and 97"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"fourth time, until the earth itself be sufficiently white and fixed [The Philosophers in general follow a different practice, avoiding imbibition till they have obtained the perfect white or red]. Azoth, that is, the mercurial water and the fire, wash and whiten Laton, that is the black earth, and take away its obscurity. The preparation of the earth is always made with the water. Therefore the clearness of the earth will depend on the dealbation of the earth and its washing. When you imbibe the black earth with the mercury [secret Fire] take care that you do not burst your glass. The imbibing must always be done on warm ashes. The time between each imbibition, to dry the matter up again, will be twenty or thirty natural days. To the dried earth put of your mercury [secret Fire] a sixth or seventh part of its weight. Seal the glass, and over a gentle heat, the vessel being placed in ashes, dry and congeal the matter, This you must repeat at least three or four times --- the more the earth shall be dissolved and congealed the more penetrating and subtile it will become. The water [secret Fire] is the spirit that purifies, subtilizes, and dealbates the body [rebis]. Flamel The earth [rebis] with its own water [secret Fire] comes to putrefaction, and becomes pure again of itself; and when well purified the whole work, by the help of God, is well governed. Azoth and fire whiten Laton [the putrefied body] and take the blackness from it. Therefore Morienus says Whiten Laton. This is the composition of the Wise men before me. Mix, says Turba, the dryness of the black earth [rebis in powder] with the humidity of its own water [the azoth proceeding from Regulus of Antimony and Mars and secret Fire] and simmer them until they be made White, and so you will have the water and the earth made white by the water. 98"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"Rosarium (Arnoldus De Villa Nova) Should the earth not be white enough, grind it with water [the secret Fire] and calcine [i.e., digest] again; for Azoth and fire wash Laton and take away its obscurity.

Marcilius Ficinus Mercury [not the vulgar] mollifies the gold, and attracts the soul from the body when the gold is sublimed with the true water of life [secret Fire]. Opus Disiderabile The concocted mercurial water is called Oil and Ointment, that is the perfected magistery. It is called water when it washes Laton [i.e., when the whole compound liquefies], and afterwards it is called oil when it tinges --- and the water is called the spirit of life. The Anima is tincture, which is concealed in the spirit. Therefore the soul [Gold] is sown in the foliated earth [Regulus of Antimony and Mars], which retains it. The black [the pulverized rebis] has ingress into its water [secret Fire]. Turba Philosophorum Know ye that the Arcanum of the Golden Work is made of the male [Gold] and the Female [our Luna]. The Male I have shewn you is concealed in our Lead [viz., in the Regulus of Antimony and Mars, when these two are joined in Rebis]]. The Female is our Auripigment which is our lead. In this the male rejoices with the female [in rebis] for she is helpmate to the male. But the male receiveth from the female a tinging spirit [furnished by the Mars].

When you see it perfectly dry imbibe it with the sharp vinegar of Ethelia [add more of the secret Fire]. Thus have I explained to you the power of our Auripigment, which is the female through whom our Arcanum is perfected. Glossarius in Turba The woman [Beja] dissolves the man [Gabricius], and the man fixes the woman in the end. Kalid, a great Philosopher, says: It is nothing but the union of the 4 elements; and it is called one thing when the metallic substance [rebis] of the water [secret Fire] become inseparably united; so that the one, a volatile spirit, and the other, a fixt body [i.e., the Gold in it is a fixt body] are in the end fixed together inseparably. Incertus 1. The first principal solution is a reduction of the imperfect body [Antimony] into a liquor or chaos. 2. The solution of the elements is a separation of the Chaos by circulation, viz., into Mercury, Sulphur and Salt, or into Spirit, Soul, and Body, or into water, fire, or oil, and earth. 3. The Philosophical solution is a solution o the Man and his Wife during Putrefaction. 4. The solution of the ferment [Sol] is a reduction of the luminous Sulphur [of the Sol] into either the White or the Red Oil [Here the Tinctures are considered as Oils or Unguents --- when they are specificated they are Elixirs]. 5.

Alphidius When we dissolve we calcine, without any interval of time --- so we sublime and compose; for between the solution and composition of the body and spirit [Rebis and secret Fire] there is no lapse nor loss of time. Corruption and Dispensation is made in putridness in the bottom of the vessel. Putrefaction is effected in a very low heat, like that of warm and moist horse dung, and in no other heat; so that nothing may ascend; for if anything should ascend the principles would be separated, which must not be, until the male and female are perfectly united and the one receiveth the other. The sign of this, perfect solution, on the surface a black colour, which is the crude tincture, and therefore must be carefully preserved by gentle heat. Water Stone of the Wise Seek three in one thing and one in three. Open these and shut them up again and you have the whole art, Solve et Coagula. The Spirit [secret Fire] will give the soul [of the Gold] to the body [Rebis]. The Spirit attracts the Soul, and returns it to the dead body, until all the three remain perfectly united. The body [principally the Gold in the Rebis] must be dissolved, must die and putrefy, while the soul [the volatilized Gold and Regulus of the rebis] and spirit [secret Fire] leave the dead body. Yet after some time they reunite, during the last degree of heat, glorified in the highest perfection. Nuysement Repeated solutions and fixations communicate to the Elixir a power to penetrate metallic bodies. But for this it could have no ingress. Therefore the youth Hermaphroditus [the Gold is here intended though commonly the Hermaphrodite 101"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"means Rebis] and his tender Virgin Sal Macis [our Diana] must be dipped in the Fountain [the solution effected by adding secret Fire to Rebis], that the one may embrace the other, and that he may be able to say to her: “The time will come when my Virgin will never be separated from me, not I from her; and that our union will continue inseparably, and both our bodies possess but one heart and one face [in tincture alba et Rubia]. Let the Island Delus appear immovable, and let Apollo and Diana [Gold and Regulus of Antimony and Mars] dwell therein [united in one regenerated body, the Tincture]. H. Von Batsdorff We have two fires, an internal [the secret Fire] and our external; the one without the other can perform nothing. If you wish to see a good effect from these two they must be managed with prudence... the external must not be too violent for the internal, or all your industry will be fruitless; the volatile will be separated from the fixt, and as our massa is extremely fusible, it will melt and sublime, which has happened to me several times, so that my work was spoiled and came to nothing. But, as Count Bernard says, the fire must be an equal digesting continual heat, not too violent. In your first degree of heat, during the solution, you must not hurry; for unless your body be properly dissolved, a true fixation of the volatile will never follow [There must be a slow gradual solution. If the heat be too great there will be a separation of the more volatile from the more gross part of the compound, which must not be]. Nodus Sophicus Enodatus Count Bernard Trevisan, in his practice says: The Fountain [Regulus of Antimony and Mars] is as it were a mother of the King [Gold]. She draws him to her, and killeth him, but the King rises again from death, through her, and unites so firmly with her, that he become invulnerable. 102"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":" Although Gabricius [Gold] is, in the opinion of the world, more precious and valuable than Beja, yet by himself he can produce nothing. That virgin Beja, our blessed water, the Philosophers have concealed in their books under many names [as Beja, Our Moon, Our Mercury, Our blessed water in which gold dissolves as ice in warm water, our Chalibs, our Steel, etc.]. Water Stone of the Wise The terrestrial body of Gold must be dissolved, destroyed, putrefied and deprived of all its powers [or natural properties], and this in the beginning of the work, assuming first a dark and afterwards a perfectly black colour, which the Philosophers have called the Raven’s head. This commonly takes place in forty days. During this putrefaction the anima of Gold is extracted and separated, and is carried aloft and totally separated from the body, the body remaining for some time without life, and like ashes at the bottom of the vessel. Ludus Puerorum The whole mixture out of which our humidity is extracted is called magnesia --- and this humidity of ours we call Argent vive. Eyraeneus Philaletha Our Stone is made out of one thing [“For Nature doth produce metals, according to their species, out of mercury alone], and of four mercurial substances, whereof one [Gold] is mature, the rest [Antimony, Iron, Mercury], crude but pure; of which two [Antimony and Iron] are drawn out of a mineral by the third [viz., Mercury], which is wonderfully joined with a temperate, not violent fire, and so cocted every day, until all be made one by a natural conjunction, most secret, not manual [The last named substance, viz., Mercury is applied to extract from the others their hidden virtue to produce from 103"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"all one quintessential virtue as in union with the Muriatic acid and so becomes a fit fire for the internal operations].

She is more fair, more grave, and yet lively and more fit for generation than any other; marry her to the Sun [Gold] and their offspring shall be your reward. And for your instruction know and note it well, that our water or mercury [or Diana] is a compound simple. Compound in respect to quality [partaking of the qualities of its ingredients Antimony and Mars], simple in respect to matter and homogeneity [being wholly mercurial]. The matter is watery, the quality fiery, which [qualities] are, according to the doctrine of elements [which is nonsense], reconciled by air but according to the principles thus: The matter [the whole matter Rebis, viz., Sol and Diana] is mercurial, the quality Sulphureous, reconciled by salt; which also may be, and sometimes are, called the water, the spirit, and the blood --- or body, soul, and spirit. Take it either way, but be sure to understand them scientifically or practically... Salt [the salt of Nature, as our Diana is often called, is here meant] prepares Sulphur [viz., Gold], Salt and Sulphur [viz., Rebis] prepares mercury [our secret Fire], Mercury preserves them: so that without salt, sulphur cannot be prepared or set at liberty from his prison [the body of Gold], it being the only key thereto; without Salt and Sulphur [Rebis], mercury [the secret Fire] cannot be qualified; and without mercury [the Sophic fire] salt [Regulus of Antimony and Mars] and sulphur [Gold] can effect nothing. Metallurgia The matter is nothing but Argent vive and sulphur, as the Ancients say, or sulphur, mercury and salt. This can nowhere be found nearer and better for or purpose than in Saturn [not his male child, lead, but his daughter Antimony]. When 104"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"clarified and spiritualized it is the medium between running mercury and the metals [the only medium by which the two latter can be inseparably united]. It is that temperate substance between the fixed and the volatile, which is the nearest matter of the Tincture.

This is the heaven [or sphere of Saturn mentioned in the Turba] --- the mother of Sol and Luna. By mercury [the secret Fire] you must dissolve the Stone [Rebis] and reduce it into tincture by volatilization and fixation: then the true Gluten of the eagle [the Solar antimonial butter] as Pythagoras says, is produced which unites with the blood of the lion [Gold]. The Philosophers concealed this true conjunction as their greatest secret... When by our art we make the perfect sulphur [Gold] to re-enter the matrix of his mother [our Diana] uniting him [in rebis] to that body whence he had his origin, he may again be born a second time [if the proper menstrual water, or secret Fire, necessary for his growth and nourishment, be added in due proportion]. Vade Mecum Philosophicum I conceive this to be the sense of what you have said: I am to take the perfect body White or Red [common fine Gold or Silver] for the Root of my Work. This must be united in just weight with the imperfect body [our unripe gold], very pure and well cleansed from its terrestrial superfluities: to which I must then add a skillful proportion of pure Mineral water [the secret Fire]...

This is the whole secret, the whole labour of this wonderful production, which the philosophers have hidden with so much care, and yet have actually unveiled in their writings, but in such a manner that the treasure shall not be obtained without labour]. Incertus Macrocosmus The Augmentation or Multiplication of the Stone can be performed in two ways: 1. By repeated solution and coagulation. This Augmentation increases the Stone in Virtue. 2. The second way is by Fermentation, which increases the Stone in quantity. The multiplication by Fermentation is soonest accomplished. What has been resolved or opened operates the quicker when fixed by its own ferment [Gold or Silver]. It is with this as with leaven --- a small quantity leavens the whole lump. The same takes place with the philosophic stone. When projected on imperfect metals it transmutes a large quantity of them into good gold. The tincture is the living gold of the Philosophers and is taken from its inward Sulphur, which in multiplication must be caught like a vapour by the moving or volatile principle. The siccity or dryness of the sulphur is the coagulating principle; and it follows that the humidity of mercury must be the dissolving principle and the principle of Multiplication, 106"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"whereby the body may be opened and multiplied; and that the moving and coagulating principle must be added to the Anima Solis, which is the tincture. During projection the subtil informing spirit is transplanted. If you ask which of the two multiplications above mentioned is the best and most useful, it appears by Reason and experience that the multiplication by fermentation [For fermentation we probably ought to read in these places solution and coagulation] is the truest and most certain --- for in all things that which is confirmed by its leaven is more perfect than that which is not. When this fermentation is properly done the event will prove that what can in the first projection tinge a hundred will in the second tinge a thousand parts, and you may exalt it as far as you wish. The more the stone is dissolved with its soul, anima or volatile spirit, and congealed again each time, the more is the tincture multiplied not only in quantity but in virtue and subtility, and in projection will fall on or transmute a greater weight of metal. There are various methods of multiplication. Some bring the medicine into a red powder, others into a hard brittle mass. This is of no consequence provided the work itself be right. Arnoldus De Villa Nova By putrefaction and frequent reiteration thereof the Philosophers’ Stone is augmented in virtue. Remember this my friend! Scotus Multiplication is either in Virtue, which is done by alteration, or subtilization, by dissolving and recongealing --- 107"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"or in Quantity, and this is done by adding new matter [i.e., by compound fermentation]. Incertus Macrocosmus The multiplication in quantity is nothing else but an augmentation in weight, so that you obtain more powder in quantity but neither diminished nor increased in power. The Same When your decoction [Tinctura alba] is completed you us know its weight. Add to it one fourth of its weight of the congealed water --- we mean that congealed water which is our volatile spirit, our Dragon’s tail, or White sperm, all which names mean the same thing. Put this fourth part to the Tincture in the same vessel, without taking the fixed Dragon [Tinctura alba] out of the vessel. Then shut the vessel very close and lute it, and decoct as before: until it is dissolved and congealed again. Repeat the imbibition, inspiration, vivification, solution, and congelation several times with our water, in one and the same vessel, without ever taking the dragon out of his den, but there kill and revive him [by the means indicated] and he will each time become more spiritual than before, and a white, crystalline matter, fixt, fusible, and tinging. Vade Mecum Philosophicum When the perfect powder, white or red, is taken out of the Philosophical egg, it appears like the most impalpable powder, whose atoms appear more minute if possible than those in the sun’s light, and yet it is very ponderous, like burnished gold [or silver]. But when united to or mixed with a perfect body of its own kind, it appears like white or red glass... easily pulverizable... The powder in its first state, whether aurific or argentific is too universal or undeterminate --- too far above specificated metallic nature [for instant 108"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"projection] and therefore must be familiarized to metals by mixture with a perfect metalline body... The Philosophers advise us to project by gradation till projection ceases --- that is, to project one part of the tincture on 10 parts, and again one part of the latter on ten, until after the last projection [no longer glass but] pure Gold or Silver comes from the fire. If in the first state the stone should only go 1 upon 100 parts, yet by reiterated solutions and coagulations, the energy, penetration, and virtue of the tincture may be increased to such a degree that its extent can hardly be calculated. If projection be made on mercury, as is mostly done, let the mercury be heated in a crucible, until its crackling noise announces its approaching flight. Then the known quantity of the fermented elixir must be projected on it which enters in an instant and tinges and fixes the Mercury... The heat must then be augmented till you perceive the matter in the crucible flow thin and clear. When poured out it will be found to be gold or silver, according to the kind of elixir... The tincture obtained by one continual linear motion, by the first circulation, is called, when perfected, the elixir of bodies. This must be cibated by 7 imbibitions, and with the last it must be putrefied, whitened and again congealed and fixed. It is then called elixir of the second order. When this is afterwards physically married with its own ferment [the perfect body], decocted, putrefied, whitened, sublimed, and exalted, it is then called elixir of the third order. As the first obtained tincture is called the elixir or Tincture of bodies, so the last is called the elixir of Spirits... The second elixir or elixir of the second order, is a middle substance, between the first and the third. When the Stone or tincture of the first perfection is imbibed or cibated, and decocted as at first, you obtain the medium or elixir of the second order; which therefore deserves to be called the spiritual elixir --- because the first tincture has now received 7 imbibitions, and with the last of them has been putrefied and renovated. Yet this is not 109"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"the perfect elixir of the third order, since it has not yet received the philosophical fermentation [viz., with Gold or Silver in the crucible as before directed]; after which fermentation the Elixir, like common fire, can be multiplied continually. Many working in this Art lose their labour by making projection on impure metals... but when melted with a perfect metal, of its own species, whereby it is converted into a metallic tinging glass, then and not before it flows like wax on an imperfect ignited metal, or when thrown on heated mercury. The imperfect metals, being too far removed from perfection, the unfermented tincture does not enter fast enough, not having affinity for the imperfect metals of strength sufficient to separate their scoria in a strong heat. Therefore the powder or tincture gets confusedly mixed and dispersed among the faeces, and the hope of the deluded Artist is frustrated. 110"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"ALLEGORICAL TERMS, WHEREBY THE PLOSOPHERS HAVE HIDDEN THEIR SECRET MEANING Pure gold without any double meaning is intended by the following terms: The Root --- the Radix --- our mature Sulphur --- Red Brass --- Terra lemnia --- Laton --- The Red Man --- Apollo --- Phoebus --- Sol --- The King --- The Male --- The Male seed --- The Husband --- The Man --- Gabricius --- The Red Lion --- The Dragon without Wings --- The fixt Sulphur --- Our Sol --- The Toad --- Hermes’ Tree --- The fire of Nature.
