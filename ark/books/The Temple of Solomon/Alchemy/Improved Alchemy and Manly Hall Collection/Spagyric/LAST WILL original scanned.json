That HERMES the Prince of Philosophers seemed to he alone, and the only inventor of this most excellent Art, Cremerus the Abbot, and our Country-Man, after thirty years study, and extensive practice and labour, was compelled to seek: in Italy for a Master. Flamel, the Luther-ian did partake of the same hard fortune, together with many others of the Ancients. Our Basilius, confesseth that he should never have attained unto the knowledge of this Art, if by Godcs special Grace, some Books of the Ancient Masters had not come into his hands. Have we not then cause to bless God that we are in such an Age, and in such a Nation also wherein we may converse with many, both Ancient and Modern Philosophers, such whose works do speak them to be Servants to the most High, Beloved of Him, and acquainted with the most occult and Secret Mysteries and Arcanums of Nature, that having toiled and spent much of their precious time in fruitless labours, to prevent the like in their successors, have discovered, and as it were, chalked out the way (so far as was lawful for them to do) how the ingenious may attain to the True understanding of this noble Arts Such is our Basilius, who from his infancy was dedicated to the Service of Godj and did so well improve those Spiritual and Natural Talents he was entrusted withal, that there was not anything he attempted the knowledge of, that was concealed from him.

It is one of the greatest unhappinesses that doth accompany Man-kind, that there is such a Babel of Languages, that every Language is not understood in every place, this alone prevents the discovery and growth of many profound Mysteries; how ignorant were our predecessors of the works of Basilius, because they were wrapt up for the most part in the German Language, very little thereof being in Latin, until of late years this part was done into English, as it is presumed by one that understood not the terms of the Art, by the many gross mistakes committed, as the rendering VITRUM ANTIMONII, the Vitriol of Antimony, and many others, so that out of the love that I bear to the author, and to propogating so ingenious and True an Art and Science, I have corrected great parts of the former Translation, and DE NOVO translated the rest, that was so imperfectly done that it would not admit to amendment, more is also added unto it, that was not in the former, the meanness and plainness of the style, pleadeth for itself, that the subject is best understood in that dress, and that the Author did effect it, being plentifully endowed with the grace of humility, offering things more than words, as appears throughout his writings.

At the consideration hereof I call to mind my writings, which I set down to paper, as other Ancient Philosophers have done before me, publishing all such Mysteries of Nature, whereby Artists, and such that bear an affection and love unto such Mystical Truths may be benefitted, and the same I loveingly and readily leave to them, as much as the highest Spagyrick, and heavenly physician hath granted and revealed unto me: My conscience, further has pressed me, in the pursuance of a Christian love, and performance of my promise, dictated by Nature, to make a larger relation, because it is a thing meet and necess-ary to set forth the Manuals which are belonging hereunto, and"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"ought to \"be described circumstantially, to inform the judgement of such men addicted hereunto to the full, namely how Natures \"bolts, which she several ways thrusted forward, to lock strongly her Secrets, are to \"be thrusted \"back, that the doors of worldly Treasures might be unlockt, that the knowledge of Transcendent Mysteries may be attained unto upon serious continued prayers unto the Creator, mens judgement and understanding might the more be egg'd on. I am not put upon either by force or indigency, nor by a vain-glory, or self-end, to set down any letter, and to leave it to posterity; only a meer consideration of the frailty and of the miserableness of this world, where the children of darkness are almost quite lost in their groping ways, hath caused me to do so. I am not able to express how much my mind is purplexed, when I think on the folly of this frail world, and consider the Cymmerian Darkness of its Children, which think themselves of deep under-standing, when they have heard some Sopperies of the Universal Chair-men discoursed of, thereby supposing to be much enlightened in their understandings. Where is that high and precious Medicine of the Ancient Philosophers, which lived before any University man talked, or heard of, who received their Revelations upon an earnest pious prayer unto God, joining thereunto their daily searchings into natural things, and laying their hands to the work. Whither I say, is fled their painfulness and industry? Surely to no other place, than to the horrid, impure, and sordid Apothecaries-shops, deeply precipitated and buried in the earth, and sunk so deep, that the ringing nor sounding of bells, and beating of morters are able to rouse it: Thus their praise and the Glory of the highest is at standJ And who produceth any good of it? Thus much am I persuaded, that if.my writings shall be produced to light after my death, and the judicious posterity, and Disciples of them do rightly read, meditate, and understand them well, and do out of a Christian intention seek, dive, and work the same only to the glory of God, and the love and charity v."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"of their fellow Brethren and Christians, then \"by means of their actions and works, that depend, from such good and proper funda-mentals, will \"be deserved and laid open to the publick view, all those Sopperies and forgeries, which these great Mouth*d vain-glorious fellows, and high conceited fools, which proclaim them- ' selves to be the sole physicians and Masters of both Medicines, that is of the inward and outward, and arrogate to themselves great dignities and worths in the world, when there is no cause for it.

Of the Aetherial liquor of Metals, or of the Metal Ferch God hath created things underground, as well as the things abov* grounds By the things underground, I understand Metals, Minerals, which there is implanted also a fertility to their seed, without v the seed could neither grow nor increase. See which is barren, ha not that fertility; by which it is collected; that there is some d tinction betwixt seed and fertility, if we will enquire narrowly w fertility is, the best and surest way is, to consider life and dea of creatures, how they hold together; for death is barren, but a 1 life is fertil, because it stirreth and moveth. It is seen by all the works that are undertaken about Metals, th; there is nothing so volatile as Metals are, and so nothing stirs at moveth more subtilly than it; but this stirring and moving I will < here the Ferch of Metals, by reason of its continual proceeding, ai incessant moving; and because the same is not visible in Metals, at doth it in a twofold way, therefore I will let the old word stand, and call its stirring a Lubricum, and its Ferch a Volatile; for wi-the virtue and power of both these, it performeth all that, what i\" needs for the perfection, purity, and Sization of its work. Seeing Ferch is a perpetual living and forthgoing thing, one mig] admire and say, of what condition is Metal then, which we behold w: our eyes, and feel with out hands; which being thus hard and coagu: whether the same be alive or dead; and whether the life or Ferch ii Meials may be destroyed, (which is impossible) what is the conditic of it, or how comes it to pass? I answer, that a Metal may be ali1 when it resteth, as well as when it groweth, or stirreth; and here a distinction must be made again betwixt the death of Metals, and their rest and quietness."},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"For death toucheth only the bodies, when they perish; hut the life itslef, or Ferch cannot perish or cease; therefore if a Metalline body be extant, then is it at hand visibly two manner of ways. The one is in liquids, and is discerned in its moving too and fro, and if it be forced by a strange dangerous heat; then it turns to a vol-atility, and flyeth away. The other way is, when it is at hand in COAGULATO, wherein it resteth so long, till it be reduced into its liquidum, and that is done in a twofold way, and lasteth so long as the body lasteth, but as soon as the body is destroyed or gone, and : come or entered into a more, either noble or ignoble body, then its Ferch or life is gone also; therefore if you will reserve and keep a body, then take good notice of its Ferch of life; for if you once stir it, and hunt it indiscreetly, you do it with the loss or dimin-unation of the body, wherein it is, for that life never goeth away empty, but still carrieth along one life or Ferch after another, car: ing it away so long, that at the last it leaveth none. But what the condition is of the moving and quietness of that life, and how Natur< bringeth it to rest, must be exactly considered. For an accurate knt ledge demonstrates, that there is a difference betwixt the life of the seed and of the body; for deal with the seed which way you will, you cannot bring it to a volatility, because it is against its Kind; and so the body is of the same condition; but the Ferch alone may be brought to it. For if you provide food for the Ferch, then you strengthen its who work, even as a mother does her child, which she feeds and cherishes well, and brings the same the better to its rest; so is it also with the Ferch. Therefore all such which gaze and view only the seed and body, and know not the fundamentals about the Ferch, lose the body, because they observe not Natures progress and proceedings, putting the cart before the horse, or the foremost they put hindmost. This rest and sleep of the Ferch serves for that use, because it preserve the body from destruction, or consumption being once come into its perfection. For as long as it is awake so long it consumes, but whe it has nothing to feed upon, then it corrodes and seizes on its own body, consuming it quite, at last it stirs and moves to another plac 2"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"Hence is it that Treasures, or payment, which are \"buried, awake at last, consume their own \"bodies, reducing them to dust, so that nothing of them remains but either a meer stone or flux, as in ma places is to be seen."},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"CHAPTER II OF THE SEED OF METALS « All those Authors which have written about the metalline seed, in that, when they say Sulphur is the masculine seed of metals, a Mercury is the feminine seed; which saying must be taken in its g sense; for common Sulphur and Common Mercury are not meant thereb For the visible Mercury of Metals is a body itself out of bodies, so cannot be a seed; and being cold, its coldness PER SE cannot b seed; and the Sulphur of Metals being a food, how can it be a see Yea, a seed consumes Sulphur, how can one seed destroy the other, so, what body should it produce? It is therefore an error, if that should be taken in the common sense; if^the Mercury of bodies is in a work, and hath taken food then all the six Mercuries protrude one body, as the one of the s is in its predominancy, so the body rises. Seeing there are seven of these Mercuries, it happens, that whe the seed of Mars and Venus has the predominancy, they produce a m culine body of Sol, but if the seed of Saturn and Jupiter does pr dominate, then is produced a feminine body, which is called Luna: Mercury is an assistant on both sides. The same happens unto other bodies; but these are always and in and each work together; for they are indivisible,as is meet also, manner of body could produce else? For Nature has perfect bodies though in themselves must be dissolved again, yet are they perfec for, if it should be defective in any of its branches? Therefore every body has its perfect seed, hence the transmutat nas its ground in the ASCENSION and DESCENSION of metals, which c wise could not be, if they were not homogeneal in their seed.

It is impossible to get a body without seed, it were as n to say, a seed is without fertility.

OF THE METALLINE NUTRIMENT. Although it \"belongs not to this place, how MINERALIA FOSSILIA ar< made under ground, however I will give a hint of it, how Nature ma] them out of Subterranean moist liquors and mine crescencies, which afterward serve to \"be a food to metals; not such liquors which are decocted above ground; therefore if you should add here above grour. decocted ones to metals, undissolved in their corporeal form, your work would be in vain; and where there are such MINERALIA FOSSELIA there are mine-works also if not with it, yet are they not far off, as is seen in many mines. As in Hungary are digged the fairest and best Sulphur-alloms and mineral or mine Vitriol. And about Harcyri are digged Salt Vitriol. About Goslar, Mansfield, Zellerfield, and Eshland in Helvetia is digged mine-salt, and at Hall there is great store of it, where there is found also very curious Sulphur. But you must note, that these minerals are not used thus grossly, but an prepared first, which is a curious work to bring a mineral thus hig] by subliming into FLORES, which are half metalline, especially if m< with metal, the metal being reduced into a mineral,from that the flc ers are made; thus you see Natures forwardness, and now she is redui ible to her first water, sulphur and salt.

Thus you must learn to go to work, for these flowers are found often closely compacted, which miner's very seldom know, especially in Hungary and Wallachia, they are as fair as ever any red glowing ore may be, they are of a crystalline transparent redness, are good Gold and Silver according as they are tinged, this is a rare know-ledge, an art worthy the best consideration, which is to make glass of a hardness, from thence it is, that the subterranean glasses make up the metal, thereby they come to their own form. The preparation of these flowers have their great utility in phy-sical ways, if their excrements be taken from them, and their odours; these excrements are the faces of minerals, are nought for metals, stirring up evil sediments, which bring damage unto metals, a twofold evil comes from the mistaking of minerals; for decocted ones are a dangerous poison, and corrosive unto metals, as we see above ground, when aqua fortis is made of them, which corrodes, tears, divides, and parts metals, and the other which are fair to look on, sticking unto metals, and their worst poison, for as soon as these approach, they kindle and cause the dangerous sediments, all avails nothing unto them, though they have and keep their form. As an infected man has full the form and face of a man, though he be infected and infects others also, and in case it turn all to one metal, yet it but an empty one, and nothing in it. This is a very necessary observation for miners and laborors, for if they regard it not, they obstruct not only their work, but endanger themselves also; because the metal is not only turned into a volatility, if any feces or excrements be added thereuntc and that also which stays, comes to be unmallable, and suffers con-tinually diminution, as long as it is under the hammer. Those that work them have cause to look to it, if they fall on them with any fire, their reward surely is some mine disease, which experimentally is knowr how their poison does stick and hang on the top of the furnace and in their chests, turning to arsenic and such poisonous fumes and seeds, and do hurt every way, as woeful experience evidenceth. i 8."},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"CHAPTER IV. OF THE METALINE SHOP, OR, OFFICINIA METALLORUM. All natural works have their special convenient places in which they work; where there is any such place or shop, in which some glorious and precious thing is made; and sometimes though the instrument \"be very horrid and monstrous, and its matter unknown, yet they are ex-tant in that office. First, touching, the glory and praise of this officine, it is likened to a Church, in which the seed and the Ferch are married to the \"body, therein they eat, rest, and work, thither they carry all fair and pleas-ent materials underground wherewith, they are clad, and they have another kind of fire, water, air, and earth, for the things that are accom-plished and perfected therein, the same can hardly be parted again, no not with the help of the neather air, if so be, that it must be parted asunder, then see and make trial of it on the mercury of metals. Again, the things made so hard and fixt cannot be parted, as may be seen of gold, how firm and fixt is it in the fire? The cause whereof is the subterranean heat and cold which it imparts to metals, and makes them firm thereby, for it is a stony firmament of the earth, and giving to metals their stony power, it grows hollow and spongy, full of parts, which at last are filled up with metals, even as bees so fill their hives with honey, and in the end it parts, and is carried away in the slick, or (scabes). For the Earth-stone is not consumed underground, because it is a sediment, not suffering anything to come in or out, hence is the difference betwixt the Earth-stone and the Terrestial-Firmamental-Stone, which is one of the mineral works. Let no man gain say, that a stone should have together both heat and cold at once, to afford the one now, and then to hide the other, for when it works upon inferior metals,then it hides its coldness, and so it helps every way. This is the Tract and instrument, heat and cold of the Subterranean Fire-Stone. 9-"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"The modern Chemists which are ignorant, not knowing Nature aright, and do not take notice of her ways, use strange instruments, and then they make or cause to \"be made all manner of vessels, according as every one of them have a fancy to, but in natures ways they know little she regards not the variety of forms, and instead of these, she takes a fit and lasting instrument, which holds in the work, and every form follows or accompanies the seeds precedency. The folly and ignorance of workmen is aggravated in that because they despise the knowledge of minerals. The instrument she uses hereunto, I should make mention of it here, but wave it at this time, and will do it in another place, where you may seek for, and take notice of it. Those which think themselves to be the wisest do say, that it is a vanity to observe mathematically the stars above, and to order any work after seasonable days and hours, it is something said, but not so well grounded. But it is most certain, that if you work according to common course, otherwise than we do, following only your own fancies, then is your labour in vain. There is a difference to be made between the upper stars, and the metalline stars, which shine and have their influence into bodies. Touching the stars above, they in their light and motion have a singular influ-ence; and the stars below have their influence also upon their metals, thus each heaven has its peculiar course and instrument, where the stars situation may be apprehended. An OPACUM CORPUS STELLATUM compact astral body, differs in its condition form a CORPUS LUCIDUM, if you intend to learn here something, then you must be industrious and grudge no pains, it would require a huge volume, if I should describe PARTIC-ULARLY the whole circumference of subterranean mine-works; it would not suffice to nominate the things only, but must demonstrate also, that all that, which I attribute to them, to be true, I say it would ask a great deal of writing, to dispose the brains of misconceited men to a belief; what should I say of such materials, on whom I could not impose fitting names, though I know them, for who is that man which has done learning in our school?

I direct such men in their work to Natures process underground, let him search there and take an honest miner along to show him her instruments, and matter (for praising, lying, and ignorance avails here nothing). Every one wishes to get riches, but the means for the getting of them are not respondent; if I were the best limner, and could set forth in colours the form of any instrument, then men would understand it; it would help in this case they would see it, and feel it with their hands and undertake the work, if all were set down.

OF EGRESSION AND INGRESSION OF METALS. « The work of metals does evidence a perpetual going in, and coming out, for hereby the Egression is understood not only the Egression of the whole work, that in some place a whole metalline tract comes into decay, when it wants food to be nourished any longer, and has devoured all its bodies, but also a partial egression; for still the one seeks the other, and follows at the heel. This we see by the mercury of metals, being poured forth, it is scattered into thousands of little quick corns, all of them return to their body; in the same condition is VOLITILE LUBRICUM; and the Ferch also goes forth in small bits, at last it joins in a body somewhere, even as bees meet together; it receives no more than it has need, the overplus swarmes to another mine-officine, which parting and distributing, affords many and several mine-works, according to the disposition of the officine and nourish-ment, and according as it is infringed in its work in the egression; the Ferch and the seed go on in their volatility, and if they had wings, that volatile is so thin, that it can hardly be discerned, yet is it foliated like a heap of atoms; thus subtility it flys away, and the Ferch, must still have its seed, the seed its body, and that its thin atoms. My meaning is not, that its egression is from or out of the earth into the air, to fly about there, and then to come into ground again; which is not so, nor can it be, because its natural work is not in the air, unless men bring it forth purposely, then is it of another condition; of that egression I do not speak here, because it is done by day; but this goes through the earth. Which stands in the furnace, not apprehensive or visible to us, and runs through clsfts and passages, for if the earth gives way to the ingression and egress-ion, even as the water does to fishes, and the air to birds, as long as metals come to their Stone-firmament, which Stone-firmament differs from the earth-firmament, when it meets with that, it goes about,"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"looking out for another passage, like as water that flows about stone, and not through it, yet it stays in its own stone and rec strength of it, and turns there to a body, And as it goes in its ression from one metalline firmament, stone-firmament to another though eaten soaked, be it at what distance it will, attract the RICUM, even as a bird draws it feet up to its body in its flight, if they touch anywhere, then they loose somewhat of the body, anc the LUBRICUM in its ingression suffers it to come again to a stre of operation, for when both are joined, then the metal increases, attracts its food in a wonderful way, and nourishes itself, and 1 is to be admired, that in this ingression, when that LUBRICUM com more and more to its officine, how it increases and strengthens i so long, that at last the work is made firm in the officine.

OF THE DISSOLUTION AND REDUCTION OF METALS. It is apparent, that natural heat is the cause of the fluidness c metals dissolution, because the seed- of metals in itself is very ho and the fluid matter of metals is hot also, as \"being oliginous, and heat increases, when it comes to its officine, or shop, because tha so being hot encreases the heat more, hence it is why it is hot in work, and has need of it, for at first it would bring no more into its body, unless it were soluble and soft, it brings nothing into i unless it be passed through these three heats, and fixed by them; tl examine it, and add another fluid thing to it, which did not pass through the three heats; see whether the metal will receive it, or i Secondly, they must be dissolved, that they may be cleaned; the con-dition of liquid things is to produce to the outside things fitting the work it has in hand. This solution is distinct from other artij ical dissolutions, where the body is only melted, as by the melter when he separates the excrements from it; for Nature does not melt the earth as men do, but as corn grows above ground, so she leaves corn and husks together; there is a great difference between our me] ing and the dissolving of Nature; if we could observe that distinctj in our dissolutions and meltings, we should not be at so great a lo£ and damages, as we ares I must needs mention about AURUM POTABLE, he men do busie themselves about itf as many heads, as many'ways they choose-1 to the making of \"it. - Some-take that which is not yet separal from the metal containing yet the cinders of excrements, or worse tlr They take corrosive waters, ACETUM AQUA VITIE; and the like; pray, tell me, what does Nature take when she is about the dissolving of £ congealed water?

A water, which congeals, has at first a little crust, go: on in it till it be quite congealed, but here it congeals from withii to the outside, hence you may guess at that glorious foundation of projection, on Mercury of the body, making a natural, STRATUM SUPER STRATUM, thus are the metals joined according to which the artifical work is ordered; we have a hint given how mercury of metals is clipt and allayed, and its LUBRICUM is catched. Conceive not of this fixal ion, to be as when iron, is hardened to steel, and then reduced to a softness as tin is of; this is called only a close hardness; which keeps the body in a malleableness, and keeps it so close together, tl the fire above ground cannot hurt it, all hardness above ground may 1 mollified in fire, but not the other; because it holds all fiery tris therefore as the hardness made above ground hardens bodies in the wa\" so on the other side, the water, which is in metalline bodies must b< taken out, then it congeals.

To get the internal fire out of metals, though it be most high ski how ever it is feasable, and found in its place, where I write of th like, in a more ample manner.

OF THE ASCENSION AND DESCENSION OF METALS. 4 This new kind of manner of speaking and writing of metals is caused by experience, for the first perpetual ingression of the Ferch encrea-ses and strengthens at first in the OFFICINA and MATRIX, the MERCURY OF BODIES, bringing it on to its perfect and full strength, being made wholly effectual and potent, then it begins by degrees to cloathe it-self with a body, at first he attracts and receives the meanest, which he puts off again in the first place, which is done the easier; for no body among them is sooner put off. For the body of SATURN is so thin, that it appears to the eye like as a fair body does through lawn or tiffeny; its spirituality appears through its body, its spiritual body is the metal of Mercury, or as I should rather call it, its pro-per, near, and special body, which work gives a manuduction into many other fair works; for it makes a garment for SATURN out of the sub-tilest earth, after he rises higher, puts a harder and better garment on him, which is not easily put off as that of SATURN, or at least not with so small a work, which is caused by the work of the MERCURY of bodies. For the MERCURY of bodies by reason of its fluidness is the hottest, as he makes it appear in SATURNS ascension, putting cinerea! body on him out of earth, hence is it why SATURN is so full of cinders inclining to a brightness of ashes, and begins to sound by reason of the metal, though it be not very firm, however yet it is at the next place for incorporation; its sound is more deaf, is further off from iron, and nearer unto mercury by reason of heat. Observe now at the ascending of this metal, it lays near the ashes, cleansed by the Sat-urnal water, but above ground it turns not to be glass out of the ashes, out of salt or earth water, or saturnal-water, or out of sand or stone.

OF RESPIRING METAL, OR OF QUICKORE. • Because with and \"by mine-works an obstruction is made upon Nature, which is the cause that several metals are gotten, and destinctions put on them, that damages and losses might be the better avoided, in the working of them. For as each received a particular name and pro-perty in or at the work, so in the digging of them, several manuals are invented for the finding of them and hereunto use was made of the Rod. To distinguish metals by colours is a curious skill, as red gold glass, mine green, black ore? however their working is not so exactly known that way. That I may lose nothing in or at their melt-ing, I use this means; first, I must certainly know the property of the ore, before it be beaten out, while it is yet underground in its breathing; for ores and metals breathe only underground, though they breathe in some sort above, yet the same breathing is very weak, not going far from the body; and the rod also sticks only upon the upper metals, which is the greatest advantage we have; for fire causes metals to breathe into a flame, and the fire-crates and pit-diggers cause only a volatility and closing compactness, where a threefold damage ensues. First, there flys away, not so much of the metal, but that also which flys turns to be volatile, and in the several meltings of it, always something goes amiss. Secondly, the remainder of it grows unmallable, which hardly can be helped. Thirdly, elevated minerals are burnt to a compactness, which if not done, would prove very advan-tagious in the afterwork, and chiefly they would be very useful in MEDICINA, being naturally prepared thereunto, which is the reason why many in their after-workings labour in vain, taking other improper minerals thereunto. For that SOFFILE VITRIOLUM GOSLAR, where neither Silver nor lead grows in that mineral, where it is prepared highly, copper may be made of it without any other addition; that vitriol affords an oil also, which perfectly cures the Gout\"; if all these good"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"qualities should be burnt away with the Silver, were it not great dam-age? Therefore I take such a metal which attracts breath, and when the unbreathing or adhalation is stronger, then is it a living metal, because a lively quality is in it; for breathing things are alive, and breathing is compared unto life, such metal like a breath, proves as a child from ten years to ten years, even so this metal grows, till it come to its perfect state and body, afterward it gets another name, and consequently there must needs be observed a great difference in their working, and are asunder as much as a live thing differs from a dead one, which ought to be taken into consideration, because this distinction being observed, affords a neat and pure work. Hither belong all mixt ores, which at separating are parted asunder and not before, (as the useful custom is). As in HUNGARY there is had every-where gold-silver (that is, in it there is gold) which in its colour and ponderosity is pure, has lost nothing, and is still in its working quality, and if it had not been interrupted, and digged up unseason-ably, then that silver would have been turned to pure gold: That silver may easily be brought to a SOLAR perfection, and in itself is it better to be used for PIGAMENT, and is of better use for cementation. In like manner the copper at MANSFIELD is good for it, and proves much better in the work, then other copper, for it wants but a little, it had been burnt quite into silver. The best quality of such copper is that they are of a deep colour, they have not lost that, as usually ELECTRUMS do. But this is to be noted, such ores are of that quality, that the bigger part of the body hides the lesser part in melting, it is not seen, nor felt, except at the washing and parting, there it is seen? while it is yet among the earth, it is a breathing ore, and is of such a compound, as you heard; you may confide in it without a proof, though the cake of it be of silver colour or of a copper colour Thus is it apparent, how Nature augments a metalline body, protruding it upward from below, and that which is neathermost is thrusted toward that which is uppermost, in a marvellous subtile way; for dead bodies bring still more to it, making it heaver in the mercury, then joins the nourishment also, which are the prepared minerals, affording their"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"tincture, like good food, which breeds good blood; hence FLORES MINI ALIUM have their existence; if you cannot learn their off-spring in that way, there is no other nor better way for it.

OF EXPIRING METAL OR OF DEAD METAL. • Metals have set time as well as all other creatures, they decay and die when their appointed time comes, for when Nature has \"brought the metalline \"body into Sol then \"by reason it wants nourishment, and is starving, then it comes down, gets a stronger exalting, and the attracl ive \"breathing turns to an expiration, an aerial \"breathing brings it to the fires-breath. If the expirapation grows stronger in a metal than its ADSPIRATION is, then it descends by degrees, and decays and then is called a dead metal or ore, for still one external body or other deparl from it, at last in one place or other it makes a total EGRESSION with its breadth, life, and seed. This breathing is known by the PARTIC-ULAR ROD of each? this also asks a particular place and work, because great gain is afforded both by this and by the living one. Consider it well, a metal, which descends from its perfection into another body, it is like when a man loses his lively colour, and at last his body, that is, its ponderosity, and then the gold turns, not to a goldish silver, but to an ELECTRUM, that is, to SOL, which has lost its tin-cture. This is a great piece of proof, to discern such silver-gold from true silver; in its gravity it is found heaver than other silver, retaining the body, and losing only its colour or tincture. It is a greater skill to restore a tincture to a dead and decayed colour, and to make it fix. At separating it keeps the quality of SOL. The like condition is red silver, in which has left its colour, making an incorporation and union with copper, so that it is quite dead in its body. To get this silver out of the copper, and restore its peculiar colour, is a g^eat skill, which melters are quite ignor-ant of, belonging meerly to the Chymick Art and its Laboratory. How many such ELECTRUMS are bought for silver and copper? The buyers thereof have great gain in it. Of the same and the like condition are other metals of. Is it not so, all iron in HUNGARY is brittle,"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"what is the reason? Because copper is in it; if that \"be gotten out in that artificial manner, as it ought, that iron proves so hard, thai no steel is comparable to it; out of that iron are made Turkish swords (savers) mails, which no weapon or bullet can enter or break; these mails also are not very heavy. Note,the LUBRICUM at the descending of Mercury, must have room, from slippery things easily somewhat may be gotten sooner than from hard things; slippery things leave always somewhat behind; the same they do with their tinging bodies, putting them off still so, that in the ascending in their VOLATILE they assume the body, and elevate it. Note, if you have any material in hand, and in your after-work you would know whether you must keep to the LUBRICUM or VOLATILE (these two must be your help). Then your stuff must be prepared, either the slippery or volatile way; if you will have a body either ascend or des-cend, take notice of the flux in the metal; slippery ones are more open than hard ones.

OF PURE OR FINE METAL . When a metal, \"be it in the ascension or descension, is in its : SYSTEMS of constitution, then it rests or endures, till it comes another body. If you meet with such ore, it yields the purest mi that may be had in the world; our melters call this super-fine, our super-fining, which hitherto was in use, is an impure work ii regard of this; for in the clarifying, if it misses but the leas-grain, then is it not yet right.

Therefore you must gi\\ an exact attention to learn to understand what the PRIMA MATERIA c metalline bodies is, and how their elevation is either obstructed augmented; how homogeneal things are brought to a body. It is app ent in the mercury of metals, how close and compact it stands toge in the flux, which flux cannot' be taken from it; purity is the rea or cause of that compactness, being there is no other metal mixed it; as soon as any metalline body joins with it, then is it disjoi: be it what metal or body it will. Hence it does appear, how metal are brought to rest from their labour, namely, if they be first pu: for into pure matter may be brought what is intended for it; which appears in the mercury of metals, its purity is the cause why it d not appear to the eye, but only in its flux or hardness.

OF IMPURE METALS • There is a sound store of metalline ores, \"but few of them are pure, and few there are that break or grow one by the other; Therefore these must be separated and spoken of apart; the great work and expenses which their cleansing requires from their grossness let melters speak of; separating has been invented, at which some good things of the ores do stay, the rest flys away, and their fining is useful, espec-ially when ores or metals are in their ascension, though it be change-able. But to find ELECTRUMS, and bring them to good by separating, differs from the former fining, and requires a singular way of melting. Cunning and subtile Artists may pretend to get silver out of iron, (I believe they may, if there be any in it) as they do in Sweden. OSEMUND always contains silver, which is only off driven, and calcine away the iron, and thus they cheat people: Can they do the like with the iron that breaks in STYRIA? No such matter. Therefore take heed of such cheaters, and take notice that nature loves to keep her own ways orderly, and keeps together two and sometimes three sorts of ores in their ascension and descension, whereby she intimates a way unto the After-work, but men in their fancy think upon other means, though to no purpose. View all the mines which are in EUROPE, you will find no other ores but impure ones, that is, a mixture of them, for their nature makes them, as much as I ever could learn; if you can show me the contrary, I will assent unto you, and this is the second argument, that metals are in their ascension and descension into perfectness; if each had its peculiar work and instrument, then men needed not to take so jiuch pains in melting to separate them. For it is a difficult work to join weeds and stones, because these are heterogeneal, and are of differing matters; but the other joining soon together, require special working to be separated; therefore view exactly the bodies two manner of ways,"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"which is no small instruction. First, in what manner you separat the ashes from the fumes or food, this minister already a two fol separating of metal, the earth from the tincture, there you have twofold separating, and so forth.

But y must call them after the sorts of the Seven bodies, and learn to pare them; this work is of greater utility. Men are at great exp to get corrosive waters, to get asunder these metals, they do it by way of melting and casting, but such waters add great poison t work; it is a better way to do it with LIXIVIUMS or sharp waters, are not so poisonous, learn their preparation. There is another of impure ore, of which I made mention here and there, which cont mine-slacks, you may read of in the Chapter of the Cinders, but t is a difference between the cinder and the slack, for slack are m corny, yet that also turns at last to cinders.

Who could tell what gold and silver were, if they were not know in their perfection, for when they are perfect, it appears, when 1 have their colour, their weight, their malleableness, their flux i hardness; and this perfect metal Nature- has produced compactly anc purely; for such perfect, pure, and compact gold is found in HUNGi in the white marble, which presently may \"be broken, as also silvei copper; the difference between the perfect and pure is because me1 are not pure before they are perfect; and so there may be a perfec ore, which is not pure; which defect is found in many other metals which come to their perfection as soon as in any other foreign paz but in their perfect purity they are defective sometimes. This is be noted by this metal, a body must first be perfect, or brought 1 its perfection, before it can be fixed, and it is of great concerr to know rightly what fixedness means.

OF THE GLOWING ROD « Because the stirring of the rod is fallen into abuse among many people; however it is a fundamental way to know and to bring forth the metals, if duly and naturally used. It is an undeniable truth, as I made mention of it before, that metals do breathe, and the sam breathing is invisible; the best means to learn it is the rod, this is the reason why I call this rod the glowing rod, because it revea! and shows the exhalations of metals, which exhalation is a fiery he; though it catches neither flame nor sparks, yet it is of such an he; that it glows in its manner; and brings the rod into a glowing, whi' is an infallible sign that there is a living metal at hand.

The manner of the setting of these breathings are worthy of being noted. It may be compared unto an eclipse, though the beams which ascends keeps its course, yet the breathing stays it, and will not let it go about that place; being in that state and condition, its FERCH and seed parts; at last, through its sides or walls it suffers fluid ores to come in; thence is the original of such fluid ores, of which there are several sorts. But this is to be noted; that weather is called a weather, because it is not of such clear air, as it is above ground with us, still carries something with it, which is grosser and hurtfull unto man more than the air above with us; for men are not commanded to dwell and live undergrounds. But if any ones employment lyes that way, he must be contented to do so, commit his condition to God Al-mighty; because he must indure, and suck in ill fume, and get mine diseases. This subterranean air grows ponderous, by reason of the fume and water-stone, which stop and corrupt the cross passage, then it is called a Weather-Salt; this is apparent when a burning candle is brought in, these ponderous fumes quench it like water, at last, they choak the men also.

Silver metalline ore is wrought many times in a red goldishness and comes forth better than the other, a proof whereof may be had, if well ordered. White gold ore is naturally thus tinged of white copper glass, which causes such ores and passages, by reason of the food of their perfect minerals, and with the glass our black fumes are exhaled, and feed upon wismuth, lead,and tin ore, wherej minerals that strike near upon the lunar passages, are greedily refreshed; thus growing the firmest and compacted silver ore of i1"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"pure, proper, and unmixed stone, meliorating the bad places and instruments which silver ore has many remarkable virtues next unto gold.

Some silver passages are found also in their natural ZACHSTONES which either are in the hanging or lying ones. Silver passages show themselves also with blue gritty flowers, hollowed fluxes, in sprinkling marbles, and carry flint-works of several colours, and these passages and clifts are full of pleasant silver colours of yellow and green, of a colour of GOSLINGS, the more they are mingled with such colours, the more they have wrought. There are some silver passages and veins, which carry three distinct colours after the manner of a rain-bow, where the one colour works in nature either more closely, or more mildly than the other; in a curious order, and the one may be discerned befor other in their passing streaks and shootings, together with their chamber-colours and floats, as they fall severally and apart in' each mine ore. 90."},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"CHAPTER V.

Copper ore is wrought in its own and proper stone, of good pure salt and over hot \"burning sulphur, through an heavenly impression into all its parts, tinged red throughout, not quite freed from a superfluous humidity, in an affinity with iron, because copper and iron are nigh kin one to another, because their dwellings and houses are set one by another, and is the reason why the one may easily be transmuted into the other. This metalline ore is much wrought in flat float works, which are green flinty: Many times it appears in a red or brown form, and is seen also like lime-stone in black and yellow flat-work; like unto coals in green flinty passages, in a twofold manner, either current, or in a manner of a float: Sometimes it is red and brown, mixed with a green colour, some are of a lazure colour, some of a copper glass, flinty and iron shot, or of a white food. The copper ore in its passage is sometimes rich of Gold, and of Silver, and is accompanied with curious Zach-stones, and inclosed with passable stones, if so be that other metals and minerals do not intreanch upon them, which corrode and consume them. And copper-ore is a flat-work also, mixed with foliated earth, and the mercurial copper is hardly brought out of it at or in an ordinary melting, affords store of iron, and unripe copper-food, which rob very much the copper in roasting, and make it unmalleable: The richest copper-ores are found in HUNGARY, BOHEMIA, SILESIA, THUR, INGIA, HOSSIA, and VEIGTLANDIA; the like is found also about TRAN-ENAU, where it breaks everywhere in a manner of a float, mixed with sand ore, and where it breaks vehemently in the flat work, they call that flat of clifts, they are poor in Silver, and such must be roasted or calcined, in some places it breaks in a fair 91."},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"blue and brown colour, or it looks ruddy, of a copper glass, and like unto green oaker, and sometimes it is white goldish, which is called white copper-ore; it grows white at an effectual mixture, because at its uniting it assumes or takes in much of Silver and of Lead: It breaks also of a yellowish and lazure-like colour, green stinted upon floats and moving passages, in lime and spon-geous stones.

Iron is not easily mixed or joined with other metals, or united in their casting. Iron has a threefold partition, and several parts in its earthy ore, namely, a Magnet, a quick metalline ore, which has its qual-ity from quick mercury, and must hold communion affinity with iron, must be quickened and renewed with iron filings, in which he lyes like a hedge-hog, and is induced by the Sun of Nature with glorious gifts and Adamantine virtues; at one place and side it attracts, and at the other side it repelles, which virtues may be augmented and increased in it; it plainly typifies or demor strates (like unto the Sun in the heavens) the true hour in the body of the compass, by water and by land.

Them he considered exactly its flowers, according to the condition of each stone-work, how and out of what the iron stone may most conveniently \"be melted, and what manner of instruments may \"be used thereunto, where it may best and most firmly be wrought; for its ore affords a threefold society and wildness, which are useful, as namely Glass-heads, which are like a sharp blood-stone, breaking in a manner of a skull, are sealy, and brown SPISSIA, some whereof are white thorns, like the wood upon which ABRAHAM purposed to offer his son Issac.

Thirdly, granulate iron-filings in the float-work, which is so hard, that it can scarcely be forced to be gotten off, or be brought to right, and when the iron-stone is come to its perfectness, then it breaks off by piece-meal through the stone and rock, that there are found whole mines of iron-stones, such is the iron ore in STYRIA. The best iron-stone is black, or red-brown, sometimes it inclines to a yellowness, some is of a cherry-brown in the floats and stocks, some are black and small SPISSIE, some yellowish, which glitters among the rest, like a copper stone of a brown marble, and of a fair glass, some liiks like separated float-work, throughout the whole mine, some is cloddy and hoary in clayish fields, which only is called the driv-ing, is as the sand-stone, most hurtful unto gold, because it affords most of the stacks, and very little of iron. Some sticks in the gray clay, which affords most malleable iron, but is of a brownish colour. There breaks also good iron stone in taitarecus and limy mines, and the most running is on the standing passages, in crifty sandy DALK-STONES. The gross clift stones break some in their flats. It usually breaks also in the fore and after mine-works, where some of it lies off-washed among the roasts, like a"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"\"brown arch; and on the day there is no ore so common as the iron-stone, because it assumes and takes in other ores, and sets it thru, thus often it changes its colour and nature, after it there insues GLASS-HEADS, EMASITES, brown stone, OSEMUND, DOLUS, togethe with the red oaker and iron shell, all those assume the nature of iron,and the iron-stone receives the highest metals, Gold, Silver, Copper, Tin, Lead, whereby it grows untoward, but gold and silver are not hurtful unto it, they make it malleable; that which is mixed with copper, or with other poor metal easily falls asunder, is brittle, of the same condition is iron-flint, producing out of many passages an huge flint, partly porous, like unto a black flat, which besides the iron-stone yields another grosser or sub-tiler iron.

Some lead stones are very broad, because glassy ores are mixed with it, with flints or marcasites, partly they are glassy, red goldish, white goldish, silvery, copper glassy, and oi copper. Some lead ore turns to a blue colour, mixed with a white transparency, like unto a shot BULUS; some is like unto the stone-salt and allom; some are of a dark green, like unto green floats, which lye gritty in a yellow or glue-coloured clay, some are of a brown black, some are yellow red, like MINIUM, some is pure and compact, some is unsprinkled and moving, some is mixed with iron, some with silver and lead, some are mixed with marble and flowers; some breaks also upon standing and level moving passages, and some is wrought in pieces here and there in slate-mines, where black lead lies along through the whole mine; some is glassy in lime-stones, and some is very rich of silver in huge marble passages. There is a twofold marble; the silver passages have a subtile light, and glassy brittle marble, which looks like the glass upon gold mine-works, is of a curious white glittering quality. Lead ore is wrought several ways, and the colour of it changes after the manner of the ores, especially is the sorts of glass ores.

True lead-glass and ores afford half or the third part of lead, mixed with some other metal, and if one of the other metals be found in the glass, which keeps the predominancy, then lead-passages are simply good, and lead is united with gold, and these are mixed stones, for the stones of mine-ores are more wonderful in their singular accidents. Thus is here the lead also in its fall, and bleak, after the heavenly impression which the highest has so indued, that it is subject to other metals, and is the supreme finer in the essential fruits of others. It easily mingles naturally with other metals, and the qualities of other ores, together with the leaves, bulk and roots into other stones of earth; And SATURN in his degree and power is the highest, in a singular division of all his works, in which he shows himself in a clarified transparent soul, running into Antimony with its sweetness, which should meerly imbrace the gold; this is done so, not without cause; for in its ponderosity it yields the highest remedy to all melancholy and heavy blood. As heavenly astrals are several, the clouds under them are of all sorts of colours; so the one lead is purer and more malleable than others, as that in ENGLAND and at VILLACH it is seen in the lead-stones also. For lead-ores which are mixed with other stones, especially with such as contain silver, iron, copper, yield much of light-stones, and lead-work, which are picked out for separating, and the rather if they are rich of gold. Such worthy metals there are in HUNGARY less pains are taken about them in!their fining. Mineral flints with their unripe juices in the weak joinings of lead ore unite the SATURNAL glass; if without any mixture affords to POTTERS a green glazure, if all be not melted into lead; but if you get a brittle mixed flint, there the glass is halt upon iron, and such"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"that are most pliable afford melting glass for fining for such stardy wild ore, which will not melt. Artists may prepare such Satumal glass mingling with it a small quantity of metalline flower, which will look, as fair as if it were a natural one. There may be extracted from lead an effectual medicine for mars health. If slate ores are found with another mixture, there are gener-ated most fixed and firm copper, Vitriol and calamy also, as they are at GOSSAR in HARLYNIA. The best lead is in ENGLAND and at VILLACH. Man cannot well be without any of his members; metals, accordin to Gods ordinance are of the same quality, if man knew to make good use of them, for Nature has provided richly for him in that way; if men work these ignorantly, what utility can they have of them? Of the metalline soul is made a chain, which links to-gether the junctures of gold and silver; these are indued with a special spirit, which is distilled into a water through a trans-parent head: Nature congeals underground in the passages such wat into ice, for a sign, that there is at hand a vein of lead, and silver, or of pure lead, and if there be a mixture of other metal about it, it is the better. The best lead passages are such waters, blue, sealy, talky, slate-stones, and fluid stricked marbles at length, or carled insprinkled ones, and not wrapt or wound about, with moving pass-ages, almost unlike unto silver ores. Some lead ores are of a white, scaly, talk-slate, full of white garnets,in which lead ore does appear, which is rich in silver. 101."},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"CHAPTER VIII. OF TIN, ITS ORE, OPERATION, MIST, STOCKS, FLOATS, FALLINGS, AND STRIKING PASSAGES. Tin ore is wrought in a sand-stone,, having its influence from Jupiter above, wrought of a dark \"brown, purple coloured, grayish, black shining mercurial salt, and some sulphur mixed with it, interlined with an unkind gross sulphureous fume, all these in-corporate together, making up the body of tin; this unkind fume is the cause of the brittleness of tin, and makes all other metal that are melted with it unkind and brittle. This Tin or QUITTER grows or breaks in a threefold manner, viz. it slides, it is full of fumes, and it grows in pieces; it has a threefold wildness also, as SHOEL, flint, and iron-mould which causes lead-works; their colours are black slate, brown, and yell These sand and QUITTER ores are invironed, or inclosed in mighty broad standing passages, which appear to the day with QUITTERS; some contain also rich paint work, some of these flints must be calcined, some are mixed with store of TALK and CAT-SILVER, which is a food unto QUITTER; and loves to stay there, some there are which grows in a GLIMMER or CAT-SILVER, and is iron-moulded, others also do strike in a fire stone or flint, so that fire must be applied thereunto, others are in a soft stone, and as it were swimming along. Some are richer than others. That which grows pure, and in black small stones, and is heaped together that nat-ural work, that gives the greatest gain. And because JUPITER is the potent Lord of it, therefore it has a mighty throne and seat, that is, a mighty huge mine-ore, out of which Tin is made by heaps, as is of that nature and property that it presses outward, and blossoms to a day, thrusting off soap-work, whence come the wash work of Tin-Soap; for QUITTER does not grow in the sand of earth, besides in its body it is"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"removed further from the seat of its throne to the foot-stool, making for itself a twofold dominion, in one it borders and reache to slates and other stones that lie about it; insomuch that his dominion increases, in which is not a little, but much, on the blue stones. Fallings, floats, passages, shools, and clifts, which incline one upon another, and do join, many times a mighty Tin-stone is wrought, which sinks down among its own cinder and slate, and at its sinking purges itself, and there come other fumes like clouds, which at all sides shoot into, and then breaking again as good as ever it did before; and it is of that good condition, that it des-pises no lodging, nor passes by any, but as poor and as despicable the stone is in that place, be it red, brown, fresh or stale, broad or small, it will press into, and mingle itself with it, making itself great, little, gross, mild, tame, subtile and pliabl even as the rest will have it, and all this in a natural way; it loves to border upon silver and iron-stones, that tin and iron be united in a mighty fixed silver and copper ore, all which are four at their several marks. Tin ore is in this place better and mall-eable, if found afar off from flint-passages, and are less minglsc with iron-mould, especially if copper stones, which in calcining can hardly be separated, proves lead-work, without any fair glass. Some of it is so mild and soft, that when they are cleared and calcined, still lose something, for flints and sulphureous matters which are volatile, and cannot indure any great heat, corrode somewhat of the metalline Tin, which appears by the white thick fume at the calcining; they are calcined thus hard by reason of Bake-iron, else they might yield as much again; for they lose extremely in calcining.

Mercury shows its virtue in many things admirably, and works effectually upon minerals and metalline sulphur, and upon such which border upon Antimonial stones or ores; it loves to be in such places where the Tin-ores lie higher than silver passages. It requires many iterating effectual operations unto other ores, and is multiplied upon other strange stones, and is drawn through the juices of Minerals and Metals, which are in affinity one to another, and produce many strange miscreants, this is the reason why it is so pleasant unto metals, Goldsmiths amalgame and gild with it.

A COMPARISON BETWEEN GODS WORD AND THE MINERALS.

No man is saved, unless he be first born again, that is:, through water and blood, which throughly purges not only men, and the sons of men, but also the whole LIMBUS upon earth; for it is not the metalline blood and water, neither is it Mercury and Sulphur that does it, neither in the body underground is any goldish silver wrought to any blood red ore, the blood out of Christ*s side shed 108."},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"for the good of man, is that great evidence for thus all mineral stones, that are in the plain element of earthi'and the spirit of all ores, and marbles and stones come from the divine essence as also the heavenly spirits are furnished for the praise of God; thus the earth also is created in her stones, ores, veins, passag for the honour of God,\" and the welfare of man, which imitates Gods wisdom, filled with infinite and incessant forthbringing of fruits. Whence should he the decay of metals? Surely even as the eyes of the holy Apostles and Disciples were held, that they could not know the Lord in his clarified spiritual \"body and essence; no mor> can men see the things in metals. Why does Saint John in his Revealation speak of smoke and fume? Surely he did not mean the fire, smoke, and fume of \"bakers ovens, or kitchen chimneys, but, there was revealed unto him the heavenly fire, the mist, vapour, and fume, which is exhaled from the mois-ture of earth,and elevated to the clouds; so in the subterranean works the fume and spoil, or outside of the ore are sublimed, and the fire of the frost which rouses the effectual powers, vapours, and spirits makes them come to a perfect unity in metalline bodies Now if there were not a fire and vapourous fume in the earth, how could they produce their fruits, which are the minerals and metals underground? As the fiery element is covered with the airy, and the heaven with clouds, and the earth is filled by them, and together with the fire was inclosed as one element with the other two. In like manner, at the first creation, the subterranean passages and veins were laden with ores, as trees were with fruit, which the Lord God in Paradise had implanted into them. This effectual fire, vapour and fume is likened unto Mercury, Sulphur, Salt, and sea-water, wherein earth lies inclosed and hidden, even as the supreamost throne of God is encompassed by other thrones and hea-venly habitations.

Seeing the holy and blessed God has laid the creatures in the earth with the four elemental qualities, therefore let rational miners open the eyes, and learn judicially to know the passages and clifts of ores, metals and minerals, then they will get a lasting name with great praise, and will be like the noble gold, which in a glory and beauty appears, when it comes from the QUART, and can be then reduced into an oil, which preserves man in a lasting health, beyond any balsom, and is become a vegetable, whic is potable. It is feasable, that of gold may be prepared a singular medic-ine for the good of mankind, because man is created of God from LIMUS TERRAE, and the whole earth is a LIMUS, such another medic-ine all the Doctors are not able to produce, which is of a curious sweet fragrance, standing distinct in two lights, and must needs be in RERUM NATURA, because it was brought on God his Altar, for an offering by mans art'prepared, suffered it to be extinguished. None knows what it is, neither the literated Doctors know the preparation of it, who when their confections, syrups, herbs,and potions will do no good, and are in despair, then they might willingly run to metals, which formerly they made conscience to make use of them in their Oyntments and plasters; of this I make mention in a reverend rememberance for true rational miners. Out of gold and silver are joined not only gold and silver monies and other plates for mans use, but they serve for mans use in many other things; and offer the first metals virtue,there come others also more and more very effectual, even to the last of metals.

My friend you must note, that \"by this intended work touching the Minerals, I had reason to prefix the two parts of Minerals, and Metals, and their ores, holding it a necessity to hold forth a light unto the ignorant, how that one spirit from above frames all such ores, Metals, and Minerals, taking their original under-ground for to generate thereby. For earth is always ready and covetous to attract and to retain that spirit, which proceeded from Heavens powers, which it presents in process of time in a formality and perfection. The manner of it has been spoken of sufficiently in my former writings, which is the reason why I give only hints of them in this place. Note, that all things proceed from a heavenly influence, ele-mental operation, earthly substance, from this mixture arise the four Elements, Water, Air, Earth, which engender by the help of fire hid therein, in a warm digestion, producing a Soul, Spirit, and Body These are the three prime principles, which in a coag-ulation come to a Mercury, Sulphur, and Salt, these three being in conjunction, according to the nature of the seed produce a perfect body; be it in the Kingdom, either of Minerals, Animals, or Vegetables. All things in the world, that are visible and"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"palpable are divided into these three Kingdoms; the Animal which contains such that have a lively breath, composed of flesh and blood, as men, beasts, worms, fishes, fouls. The Vegetables which contains trees, herbs, seeds, roots, fruits, and all such things that are of a growing quality, the Minerals contains all manner of ores, Metals, Minerals, Marcasites, Calxes, Zinks, Lobols, all sorts of flints, pebbles, wismuths, stones, precious ones and others. Animals have their special seed, a spermatic substance, which after copulation generate flesh and blood, which seed is their PRIMA MATERIA, from a heavenly influence, created by God of the four Elements, wrought by nature, which formerly were quoted in my writings. Vegetables also have their proper seed which God bestowed on them, according to their several qualities and form by a heavenly and siderial influence, and receive their elemential fruitful growing from the earth, with an order, thereby to generate and augment. Minerals and Metals also have their original seed from God,by the heavens influence in a liquid aerial substance, by a Mineral Spirit, Sulphureous Soul and Earthly Salt in one body joined; of these I have spoken in my former writings. Note further, if any of these Metalline and Mineral kinds shall be brought to a further propagation and augmentation, it must be reduced to its first seed and PRIMA MATERIA. If you will transmute Metals, augment them, bring them into a tincture, or philosophic Stone, you must first understand, how you may destroy by a Spagyric Art, the Metalline and Mineral form and separate it into Mercury, Sulphur, and Salt, these three must be purely separated, and brought to their first principles. This separation is done in, and by a Mercurial Spirit, Sulphur-eous Soul and white Salt. These three in a due ordering of a true manual must be joined again, that they may be brought to the highest and most .perfect purity. 120."},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"In which conjunction must exactly he observed the quantity; after this conjunction the whole substance is meerly a liquid substance and philosophic water, in which all the Elements, first the heavenly, then the elemental, and lastly the earthly qualities are shut up and lie hid therein.

Therefore observe and take notice, that all Metals and Minerals have only one ROOT, from which generally their descent is, he that knows that rightly, needs not to destroy metals, to extract the Spirit form one, the Sulphur from a second, and the Salt from a third.

Why I did the „work of the Philosophic Stone upon Gold Metal, this is the reason that the simple laborators, to whom is unknown the other body, or SUBJECTUM, which contains all the three prin-ciples; though it be a thing well known, yet is it a stranger to their brains, may learn hereby more wit and knowledge. Many of"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"the ancient Philosophers, which lived long before me, have in the same manner with me obtained the true universal stone of all myst-eries and health, as their books, which are extant, give evidence thereof.

The highest in heaven bes-towed his further grace and blessing upon me, that I took unto further consideration the tinging animated spirits placed and planted into their several bodies. Let no man be ashamed to learn, to add more to his learning, and to dive further into that, which was hid from him, not withstanding his knowing ways. Nature reserves many things in her secrecy, which mens dull understanding and shortness of life cannot reach into. Whereas God in his great goodness has bestowed this great gift upon me, for an improvement of that talent, I have imparted the same to my fellow Christians in the said XII Keys. Those that are indued with deeper wits and knowledge, and in their hearty and careful endeavours strive further to dive in the Art, will meet in the same place with a more easie and more known matter, which was almost named and set down, of an effectual qual-ity, out of which in like manner, as the ancients before me, in their exact speculation and practick have in the end better known the only scope and drift, which has been practised several times by me also, in a shorter time, and less pains taking, both they and I nave obtained health and riches; in this known and despicable matter and Mineral substance is found a Sulphur and tincture more effectual, and more worthy, than the best Gold can afford, which is fluid and open, and its Mercurial Spirit also, and its mystical Salt is free and open, whose virtues may with less pains in a visible manner be drawn from it.

At the beginning of my XII Keys, according to the manner of Philosophers, in a parabolical way I made relation of the propert and work of our stone and balsom, how it was made by Artists, whi as by an inhearitance it came to me also, wherein I spoke as much as was meet of the government of the fire, chargeable appearance, and of the chiefest planetical colours, and the final end thereof After the accomplishment of these puruse well the XII Keys, for each contains a PARTICULAR work. The first Key informs you, that if you seek for the seed in a Metalline Body, as in the Gold, then before all things it must most exactly be purged from all its impure leprosie, and that nothing must be mixed with our fountain, but such, which is of a pure spermatic quality. This purifying is performed with Anti-mony, which stands in a near relation, and affinity unto Gold, which is the reason, why antimonial Sulphur purges the Soul of Gold, graduating the same to a very high degree. On the other-side, the Gold can meliorate in a short time the Soul of Anti-mony, and can bring it to a firm fixation, exalting Antimony and Gold to a dignity and virtue, and can be brought not only into a white metal of LUNA, but also to a transcendent medicine for mans health, of which you shall have a further direction hereafter, which I shall treat in particular of Antimony. Although Antimony has promised unto SATURN a sociable brotherhood, because Antimony qualification does rest in some sort on the quality of SATURN in an equal concordance, yet after the fixation of the exalted Sul-phur of Antimony, his next friend SATURN cannot get any prey from him, because the King received him into his golden Palace, and ma]"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"him partaker of his Trimphing Kingdom. This is the reason, why he can endure now heat and frost, and overcomes it, and stands with the King a conqueror in great and transcendant glory. The putrifying of the Gold is performed thus: Laminate the gold thinly, after a due manner, cast it thrice through Antimony, after wards the REGULUS which is set at the through casting, must be melted before the blast in a strong fire, and driven off with SATURN, then you will find the purest, fairest, most lustrous Gold pleasant to behold, as much as the lustre of SOL is.

You must note, that this dissolution is not sufficient, and the King is not minded as yet to let go his Soul out of his fixed body, which you can see when you separate the water from the dissolved body of the King, where you shall find fixed powder of Gold, out of which you will hardly get his Soul that is therein.

The answer hereunto I delay so long till the Querist learns better to understand the distinction in this book, and I will perform my promise, and set his anxious and intangled mind at liberty, which is so much troubled about this doubt, and will deal with him as a good father may deal with his son; in and with this SCOPE, wherein our Mastery lyes,have been fooled most of the wits, leading them captive in their erroneous ways, being led about in a desert of misled ways, because in those supposed deep wits, they had not conceived so much of the manner, how all things of the world are generated, and that every Spirit must have a Soul and every Soul a fit Spirit, and that both Spirit and Soul are Spirits and spiritual, which must have a body, in which they may have a dwelling. Gold and Silver, but chiefly Gold is brought to the highest fixedness, by such degrees as nature did afford, insomuch its nature is found very hot and fiery, freed from all phlegmatick humidity, of which LUNA is not so wholly freed,though she has obtained a Sulphur-fixed degree, and stays for the King, to warm her cold body with his hot seed, which concerns the particulars, and belongs unto them, which in that place shall be plainly demonstrated. In Gold there is no waterish humidity at all, unless It were reduced again into Vitriol, which would be but an useless and unprofitable work, and would require huge expenses, in case the Philosophers Stone should be of Vitriol of Gold, of which there must be had great store; indeed in that Vitriol there would be"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"found a convenient spirit; which nature would desire, of a white quality, as also a Soul and Salt of a glorious essence.

The Solar Mercury SOL, being never brought so far unto des-truction, neither did the ancient Philosophers ever make use of that way, as being a thing clean contrary unto nature, containing indeed an humidity, but it is a meer Elemental waterish humidity after its dissolution, and good for nothing, water and other principles do not stand in the Elements, but the Elements rest in the principles and seeds of Metals, of the which I have spoker formerly. Therefore let none be so over witty, as to make our stone only of dry and fully digested Gold; because its phleg-matick humidity is entered into a dry fixedness and fixed coag-ulation, which is not found so in other Metals, though they also are subject to a hard coagulation and passed through the fire, yet are not wholly digested, nor brought to a full maturity from the natural original root; which ought to be taken notice of; and be not offended at my former writings, if they seem to run contrary against this. Though I have showed, that the Spirit, Soul, and Body come all from one Metalline essence, and must be prepared thus, among which I hold the Gold to be the best, however I dealt herein as it seemed fit for a Philosopher, the like the ancient Philosopher have done before me, but I hope you took notice of my protest-ration, that I gave special cause thereby to your speculation, to take the better notice of Nature and her principle, and to consider the original; because it was not meet for me to inform all men, how the doors are bolted within, and especially at that time, when I never intended to write thus plainly of these things which are hid even from the best of men, but when my heavenly 129."},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"Prince commanded at the changing of my mind, not to bury the im-parted talent, but to do the like to those, whom God think worthy, to leave it to them.

Peruse all such which since the beginning of the world have written of Metals, you will find, that they were all of one mind, and that I make use of their sayings; that the first and the last Metal is a Metal, because the first Metal has already obtained, and gotten the forth-going seed of Metals in a Metalline quality, which does nothing else, but that it goes on ancessantly in the Metalline generations, as I spoke of in the first and second part of Minerals and Metals, and in this part also I have spoken of it in several places. Many have called Gold Lead, and Lead they called Gold, because it was found not only of the same ponderousness, but because three deep glittering stones have solely gotten from this Planet. Their transcendent perfection, and many other causes besides, which to relate here, would fall to long and needless. And this is it which asks wisdom to distinguish in this and other things, and exactly to search into Gods mysteries, and natures laid before us.

The obduration being so great among the covetous, that for the most part they search and dive into such mysteries out of meer coverousness, pride, and ambition, made the ancient Philosophers upon command and inspiration of the highest aim at that, as to put a certain stay to their hands, and to write such mysteries in such a manner, that unworthy men should not understand it, and but worthy men only in their illumination might perceive it; and writing often one thing, have mingled other among, understanding still the one and the same.

Thence this Art grew eclipsed, insomuch that scarce one among many thousands hardly attained unto the knowledge thereof; and for that reason is it held for an Art, because not every Dune should bring it into his Beetle-head, and why should it? For if this Art were as common as brewing beer, and baking bread, then any one may judge what good could be looked for; would not all manner of vices be practised publicly without any controlling? Therefore such men, which in their lofty mind are meerly for pomp and pride, must be clipped in their wings, and these things ought not to be put in their mouths, things are clear enough for those, on whom God intends the bestowing of them. I return now to the thing I intended, which is to teach a des-irous Schollar, how to proceed further with the unripened Soul of Golds I rule it is much to discover such mysteries, I warn everyone to make good use of them; and note, that if you have the purple mantle of SOL, as the Sulphur of SOL, then be thankful unto God for it, bear no evil mind against your neighbour, un-lock your golden seed according to the Tenor of the Key, turn it to water; for in our Art there must be Body, Soul, and Spirit, which run together in the innermost root, the one lays hold on th other meliorates the same throughout in its whole quality, inso-much that there is a new created world and earth, which afterward is illuminated by the Soul, and is exalted into a transcendent efficacy. Therefore it is requisite that you know, how tc infuse your golden seed into the new body, and to bring it to a fluid sub-stance; Look about thee, and see where you may find it; if you find none, despair not, but be of good comfort, think upon means, and ask counsel of god SATURN, he will not let you go without a 131."},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"resolve, he will put into your hand a deep glittering MINERA for an offering, which in his mine is grown of the first matter of all Metals, if this MINERA after its preparation, which he will show unto you, is set into a strong sublimation, mixed with three parts of bole, or tyle meal, then rises to the highest mount a noble sublimate, like little feathers, or ALUMEN PLUMOSUM, which in due time dissolves into a strong and effectual water, which brings thy seed in a little putrefaction very suddenly into the first volatility, if so be there be added to it a due quantity of water, that it may be dissolved therein, there the twig, with the bulk does unite, that they are able to ascend above the highest moun-tain, and stay inseparably together a Soul and Spirit, or a Spirit and Soul.

Observe only this difference, that the Salt must be drawn forth from the Mercurial body, as it happened unto the Soul, with the Spirit of Mercury; whereas on the other side the Salt of Gold must not be drawn forth with the Saturnal-water, because it is too weak for' the body of Gold, but with a water, which has been expressed in the description of particulars. This distinction must be exactly observed, being of great concer ment, because the Salt of Vitriol is not so strongly guarded, and is not in so fixed a body, as the Gold is, but is still an open body, which saw no coagulation as yet, nor passed it through any melting fire, therefore that body never came as yet to any compact"},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"there is room left for its own Spirit to enter into, can embrace, and unite with its like, and a snow white extraction of Salt may \"be had, whereas on the other side a sharper matter must penetrate Gold, as you shall hear, when I shall speak more of it in its due place.

Consider it well, how sincerly and faithfully I disclose unto thee all thy locks and bonds, whereby the whole Philosophic wisdom is shut up, which hitherto never entered into any mans thoughts, much less that ever it was practised, or discovered; and nothing caused me to do it, but only Gods infinite mercy, my good will and love toward my Neighbour, which my Predecessors have not done so completely, and was put off unto me to do it. Having thus separated your three Mineral bodies, and ordered them into certain divisions, and put away the dregs, wherein they lie hid, then look to it, that you neglect none of it, by the diminishing of the quantity, which would prove a great fault to your work, and keep each in its own and due quantity, otherwise in your work you cannot come to a happy end. This is the thrist which so many have missed, and have written great volumes about its For all what comes from our Philosophic Gold, and has divided itself into three parts, the same must be brought into one, without any loss and diminunition, which is to enter into a new form again, and become a meliorated substance, and nothing of it must be done away, but only the FECES TERRE in which the glorious Salt had its dwelling. Therefore do that I told you of, and join the Spirit with the body, bring the body also into a Spirit, dissolve and exalt it into the highest Spirit-ual power, in that dissolution the body turns to a Spirit, and the Spirit with the body unites and joins into one substance, that after the exchanging of all manner of colours, there comes a white body like snow, transcending all whiteness.

Thus you have made and brought into the world the QUEEN of HON-OUR, and the first BORN DAUGHTER of Philosophers, which after her due perfection is called the white ELIXIR, of which great volumes are extant. Having brought your work thus far, then you have deserved to be received into the TURBA of Philosophers,and you get more Art, Wisdom, and understanding than all sophisters, whic'. prate much of these mystical things, and yet know not the least thing of it.

The augmentation of this huge treasure together with the fer-mentation thereof, for the transmutation of Metals doubtless you have taken notice of exactly afore, where I wrote of Gold how it must be handled, and what direction I have given you, thereunto, the same you must observe; for here is all one process from the middle to the end, the beginning only asks alteration, by reason of the two distinct matters: For the which God be praised whom we beseech, to give us his grace and blessing, that we may make good use of this treasure, and after this life we may enter into the heavenly Kingdom.

The Art being great, and the matter so contemptable, it procures the more doubt and unbelief; Those unbelieving men I let understand only this notable example, whereby the eyes of those, that are going unto EMAUS, shall be opened, and thereby shall acknowledge that I have written no un-truth, but disclosed such a truth very plainly. And note, that th ancient Philosophers endeavoured to describe the preparation of the Stone under a notion of distilling of wine and the Spirit thereof, which in their work are almost like one to another. For they taught out of the best wine to make a Spirit, without any strange phlegme, which to this day among vulgar Artists must be, and is called the right and true mystical Spirit of wine, whereas it may soon be proved, that this supposed Spirit of wine contains much invisible humidity, or phlegme in an invisible manner,which is nothing else, but its vegetable Mercury; for the fiery Spirit of wine is the true fire and Soul of the*wine. Every Sulphur contains secretly its original and principal Mercury: Vegetables in their kind, the Animals in their kind, and the Minerals also after their kind. They taught how this Spirit of wine must be separated in two"},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"distinct parts, namely, that this Spirit of wine be poured upon white calcined Tartar, and be drawn over in a gentle distillat-ion. In this distillation is separated the Secret and true Spirit of wine from its Vegetable Mercury, as I faithfully informed you in my Manuals. From the remaining earth they taught a Salt to be drawn, to be added to the rectified Spirit, whereby it is fort-ified and strengthened in its substance, and at last the Philo-sophers Stone should be generated. It is mightily against Gods ordinance, that a Vegetable should produce an Animal,or an Animal produce a Mineral. By way of a parable, the practick part is held forth under the notion of this preparation. Now as they taught of the wine, so in like manner also by a short way may our Gold be prepared (not the usual and common Gold) and may be dissolved, divided, separated, and brought into its first principle. But you must note, that this dissolution and separation was never described plainly by any of the ancient Philosophers which lived before me, and knew the MAGISTERIUM, why I do it, the love of my neighbours has moved me thereunto, which I bear from the center of my heart to all those, which overcame this mystery with-out falsehood, and shunning vices with a faithful heart, in a sincere knowledge and real piety. • In the first place be informed, that our Gold (so much spoken of hitherto) must never be taken for such Gold by any of our disciples, which has been melted, and fully digested by nature, for herein such error is committed, that men dilapidate all what they have, and loose both the beginning and end of all their works. Although not only from Gold, but from other Metals also this CLENODIUM, and jewel may be had, in the preparation of it, PARTICULARITER much profit and advantage may be gotten in that, which concerns mens health, as has been formerly told; however, without the Spirit of Mercury the UNIVERSAL of the World to be gotten meerly from the body of SOL, is impossible, and will be impossible, unless the Creator of all things produce another ordinance, to change and alter his creature after his own"},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"will. But as that is impossible, so is it impossible also, to deal against Gods creature in that kind, as to find out that wholesome profit, which to your longing desire you expect, you may believe it for a truth, as Christ himself is, that the Philo-sophers Stone would not be so strange, rare,and unknown a thing, it would be common to Kings and Potentates, if God would permit it to be made of Gold alone, and the three Jewels of infinite fixed virtues hid therein, could be had out of it! My intent is not in this present treatise to use any prolixity in writing; those that are not quite blind, and have their eyes open, have enough already to attain unto real knowledge, and command both his mind and hands, not to pass by the weightiest, and esteem high things that are unworthy, and to fall with the blind into the pit, made for them. To those that are real in thei desire for to attain unto Art and wisdom, and intend to propogate the same without sophistication; and desire in reality to glory in that honourable truth, you may show a real proof of it in this manner. I tell thee really for the highest truth, that you may dissolve OUR GOLD, naturally driven together, in a short way, to bring it to its PRIMA MATERIA, and is done thus; take the known Mineral Spirit, in which our MERCURY, SULPHUR and SALT is shut up, con-taining that Philosophic mystical Gold, pour that GLUTTATIN upon white calcined tartar, those two contrary qualified matters will be TISSING, let them stay together till their contention and strif be ended, and our Gold hide itself invisibly in the vegetable SALT ACRE, or in the belly of tartar, lute a Helmet to it, distill it at first gently in BALNEO, then increase your fire, then HERMES his volatile BIRD will fly away from our Gold in that SUBLIMATION, ?r.d sit on the highest pinnacles of the Temple, lookiaag about which way to betake himself, but soon is catched in the RECEIVER, which must be pure and very dry; when you see his flight is but slow, then take the glass out of the BALNEO, set it in ashes, increase your fire, then will she fly more nimbly, keep that fire 1*4-5."},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"so long till all is come over, and her brother the RED DRAGON, hiding his redness under a red colour in a whitish fume, will begin to follow after his flying brother. Then cease with the fire, the drops being all fallen from the Helmet, take it off, that which you find in the RECEIVER, you are to keep as a treas-ure of mysteries. In this manner you have gotten wisdom, under-standing, and skill, the fundamentals also, and desires of Philo-sophers; by this short witty proof you learn and get that knowled how this water may be sought after, found, and lighted on, and is not to be esteemed a common water, but is that real infallable HEAVENLY WATER,of which at the beginning I have written, and re-peated the same the oftner; which in a spiritual manner from the HEAVENS POWER is poured down upon the earth, begins and accomp-lishes the generation of all Metals, for that reason the ancient Philosophers called this water MERCURY, but I call it the SPIRIT MERCURY. Now if you proceed right in this work, and you know what food and what drink to give to this bird, viz., Sulphur and Salt of Metal, then you may attain unto the end of the great work, and yo may get profit infinitly PARTICULARITER many ways; you must note, that this is not the true Philosophic dissolution, but only one which PARTICULARITER performs strange matters, and is a SPECULUM, in which our MERCURY, or SOL, and our LUNA is seen bleaking, whic is a present confusion of unbelieving THOMASES, discovering the blindness of ignorant men. The dissolution of the three PRINCIPI I have described unto you formerly, which is of a slower pace, requiring time and patience, and an exact intention to make, or bring three into one, which work is done in itself PER SE, with-out mixing of any heterogeneal matter, only that which lyes hid in it, must do it, for the fountain of salvation is the illumin-ation of the Soul, and the Salt of the clarified body, are all ir that one thing, existing from ONE, TWO, or THREE, which must be brought and reduced to ONE, which is the golden virtue of all Metals, exalted above all powers, together with the EAGLE and"},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"white body, which are nowhere together, but only in this ONE are found, and in that which is next kin unto it, which knowing Philo sophers always held in great esteem, but ignorant and blind men despised and disgraced the same. But those, whose eyes are once opened, love to stick unto much, covet to hide the matter from wicked men, and study day and night how the ignorant might be kept from it. Thus I close this third part. And before I begin the fourth part, concerning PARTICULARIA, I must needs speak something of the Philosophers VITRIOL, SULPHUR and MAGNET. My friend, you must note, that this description I make now of the essence of Vitriol rests only upon trials made, the victor-ious triumph of the highest wisdom came by inheritance from the most ancient Philosophers unto me, and comes now unto thee, where experimentally it is found, that there is a subterranean MINERAL SALT, called VITRIOL, which for dyeing of clothes, and many other uses, men cannot well possibly be without it, for it carries on and eats through, by reason of its sharpness, which is distinct from other SALT, in respect of their qualities; for the MINERAL of this salt is strange, of a very hot and fiery quality, as apparant in its spirit, and contains a twofold spirit, which is MIRACULUM NATURE, and is not found the like in other salts and this salt is an Hermaphrodic among other salts, it is white and red, even as you will have it, it has an extraordinary medicinal quality, performing things in an incredable manner. This salt contains a combustible SULPHUR, which is not in other salts. Therefore in Metalline affairs touching their transmutat-ion, it performs more than others, because it helps not only to open some, but helps the generation of others, by reason of its innate heat. When VITRIOL is separated by means of fire, then its spirit at first comes in a white form, after that there comes from its earth a spirit of a red condition, staying in the earth, the salt being united with its expelled Mercury and Sulphur, can 1^7."},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"sharpen them; the remainder that stays \"behind, is a dead earth, of no efficacy. Let this suffice for your learning and consider well what the Creator holds forth unto thee, in nature by this nov\\ kindled TERNARIE: For as you find in Vitriols body three distinct things, as Spirit, Oil, and Salt, even as you may expect from its own spirit again (which without the mingling of its oil, is driven from its matter) three distinct things, even as you did formerly from the body of Vitriol, which deserves very well the name of SPECULUM SAPIENTIA PHYSICA, held forth purposely to man to view himself. For if you can separate this Spirit of Vitriol, as it ought, then that affords again unto you three principles, out of which only, without a either addition, from the beginning of the world the Philosophers Stone has been made from that, you have to expect again a Spirit of a white form, an oil of red quality, after these two a Christalline Salt, these three being duly joined in their perfection, generate no less than the Philosophers great Stone; for that white Spirit is meerly the Philosophers Mercury, the red oil is the Soul, and the Salt is that true Magnetic body, as I told you formerly. As from the Spirit of Vitriol is brought to light the red and white tincture, so from its oil there is made VENUS her tincture, and in the Center they are much distinct asunder, though they dwell in one body, possessing one lodge; it matters not, for the will of the CREATOR was so, to hide that mystery from unworthy men; observe and consider it well, if so be you intend to be a true follower of Philosophers; in this know-ledge lyes hid a irrecoverable error, worldly wits cannot conceive of it, that the Spirit of Vitriol, and the remaining oil should be of so great distinction in their virtue. Touching their pro-perties, the Spirit being well dissolved, and brought into three PRINCIPLES, Gold and Silver only can be made by it, and out of its oil only Copper, which will be apparent in a proof made. The condition of the Spirit of Vitriol, and its remaining oil is this, that where there is Copper and Iron, the SOLAR SEED commonly is not far from it, and again where there is seed of Gold at hand,"},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"Copper and Iron is not far from it, \"by reason of its attractive Magnetic quality and love, which they, as tinging spirits in a visible manner continually bear one to another. Therefore VENUS and MARS are penetrated and tinged with the superabounding tinct. ure of Gold, and in them there is found much more ROOT of the RED TINCTURE, than in Gold itself, as I made further relation of it in my other books, unto which there belongs also the MIN-ERA of VITRIOL, which goes beyond these in many degrees, because its Spirit is meer Gold and RUBEDO, a crude indigested tincture, and in very truth (as God himself is) is indeed not found otherwj But this Spirit, as you heard, must be divided into certain dis-tinct parts, as into a Spirit, Soul, and body, the Spirit is the Philosophical water, which though visibly parted asunder, yet can never be separated RADICALLY, (because of their unavoidable affinity they bear, and have one to another) as it appears plainl when afterward they are joined, the one in their mixture embraces the other, even as a Magnet draws Iron, but in a meliorated ess-ence, better than they had before their dissolution. This is the first, beginning, middle, and end of the total Phil sophic wisdom, affording riches and health, and a long life, it may rather be said, and really proved, that this Spirit is the essence of VITRIOL, because the Spirit and oil do differ so much, and were never united RADICALLY, because the oil comes after the Spirit, each can be received apart: This fiery Spirit may rather and more fitly be called an essence, Sulphur, and substance of Gold, and it is so, though it lyes lurking in VITRIOL as a Spirit This golden water, or Spirit drawn from Vitriol, contains again a Sulphur and Magnet, its Sulphur is the ANIMA, an incombustible fire, the Magnet is its own Salt, which in the conjunction attrac its Sulphur and Mercury, unites with the same, and are insepar* able companions. First in a gentle heat is dissolved the undig-ested Mercurial Spirit, by this is further extracted, after a Magnetic quality, the SULPHUREOUS ANIMA, in that earth sticks the Salt, which is extracted also in a Magnetic way by the 1^9."},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"Mercurial Spirit, so still the one is a Magnet unto the other, bearing a Magnetic love one to another, as such things were the last together with the MEDIUM is drawn forth by the first, and are thereby generated, and thus take their beginning. In this separation and dissolution the Spirit, or Mercury is the first Magnet, showing its Magnetic virtue toward the Sulphur and Soul, which its QUASI MAGNES attracts, this Spirit PER MODUM DISTILLAT-IONIS being absolved and freed, shows again its Magnetic power toward the Salt, which it attracts from the dead earth; after the Spirit is separated from it, then the Salt appears in its purity; if that process be further followed, and after a true order and measure the conjunction be undertaken, and the Spirit and Salt be set together into the Philosophic furnace, then it appears again, how the heavenly Spirit strives in a Magnetic way to attract its own Salt, it dissolves the same within XL days, bringing it to an uniform water with itself, even as the Salt has been before its coagulation. In that destruction and dissolution appears the hugest blackness an ECLIPSE, and darkness of the earth, that ever was seen. But in the exchange thereof a bright glittering whiteness appearing, then the case is altered, and the dissolved fluid waterish Salt turns into a Magnet; for in that dissolution it lays hold on its own Spirit, which is the Spirit of Mercury, attracting the same powerfully like a Magnet, hiding it under a form of a dry clear body, bringing the same by way of uniting into a deep coagulation and firm fixedness by means of a continued fire, and the certain degrees thereof. The King with the white crown being thus generated and by ex-iccation of all humidities being brought to a fixed state, then is it nothing else, but earth and water, though the other Ele-ments be hid therein insensibly; however, both these keep the predominance, though the Spirit turn to earth, and can never be seen in a watery form, and this double new born body abides still in its Magnetic quality; for as soon as its departed Soul is res-tored after its white fixation, then like a Magnet it attracts"},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"the same again, unites with it, then are they exalted to their highest tincture and RUBEDA, with a bright transparentness and clarity. Thus in brief you have a short relation of Vitriols, Sulphur, and Magnet. Pray to God for grace, that you may con-ceive right of it, put it then to good use, and be mindful of the poor and needy. At the closing I annex this briefly, to hold forth unto you a natural proof, that you presently fling and throw down the SOPHISTER, and take his Scepter from him. Note, that from all metals, especially from MARS and VENUS, which are very hard and almost fixed metals, of each apart can be made a VITRIOL; this is the reduction of a metal into a Mineral; for Minerals grow to Metals, and metals were at first Minerals, and so Minerals are PROXIMA MATERIA of Metals, but not PRIMA; from these Vitriols may be made, other reductions, namely a Spirit is drawn from then by the virtue of fire. This Spirit being driven over, then there is again a reduction of a Mineral into its Spiritual essence, and each Spirit in its reduction keeps a Metallic property; but this Spirit is not the PRIMA MATERIA. Who is now so gross and absurd, that should not be able to con-ceive further and believe, that by these reductions from one to the other there be a way to PRIMA MATERIA, and at last to the seed itself, both of Metals and Minerals; though there be no necessity to destroy Metals, because their seed in the Minerals is found openly fixed. 0 good God, what do these ignorant men think, is not this a very easie, and Childrens like labour? The one begets the other, and the one comes from the other, is there not bread baked of corn, upon distinct-works?

On the remaining matter pour Spirit of TARTAR, of which in another place, \"because it belongs unto Medicinals; digest these for a months time, drive it through a glass retort into cold water, then you have quick Mercury of SOL, many strive to get it, but in vain. There is one mystery more in Nature, that the white SOLAR body having once lost its ANIMA, may be tinged again,and brought to be pure Gold, which mystery is revealed to very few: I shall give a hint of it, that you may not grumble at me to have concealed any point in the work. I hope you have considered and taken to heart, what I have en-trusted you withal about the Universal Stone of Philosophers in my third part, namely how it rests meerly upon the white Spirit of Vitriol, and how that all three principles are found only in this Spirit, and how you are to proceed in, and to bring each into its certain state and order.

There may be prepared yet in another manner a transparent Vitriol, from Gold in the following manner.

This being done, then cant off the AQUA REGIS from the Gold calx, edulcorate it with common water, eight, ten, or twelve times; the Gold calx being well settled, cant off that water, and dry the Gold calx in the air, where the Sun does not shine, do it not over a fire, for as soon as it feels the least heat it kindles, and great damage is done, for it would fly away forcibly, that no man could stay it.

Having lived some time in my Order, then also, after I had done my appointed devotions, meddling not with frivolous things, least my vain thoughts through idleness should yield causes of greater evils; I took upon me diligently to search into Nature, and through' ly to Anatomize the ARCANUMS thereof, which I found to be the greatest pleasure next to Eternal things. Having found in our Monastery many books written by Philosophers of ancient time, who had truly followed Nature in their study and search; this gave a greater encouragement to my mind, to learn those things they knew; and though it proved difficult to me in the beginning, yet at last it proved more easie. The Lord so granted (to whom I daily praised) that I should see those things that others before me had seen. In our Monastery, one of my fellows was much tormented with the Stone, that he oftentimes lay bedrid, had sought many physicians, and dispared of any help from them, resigned up his life to God, having layed aside all humane help. Then began I to Anatomize vegetables, and distilled them, I extracted their Salts and Quintessence: But amongst all these, could I not find any thing, that would free my sick brother from his distemper, although I tryed many things, for they were not so effectual in their degrees to cure that disease, so that for six 180."},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"years space, there was hardly any vegetable, that I had not in some way or other wrought upon. Then I \"bent my thoughts to consider further of this matter, an< to addict myself to a fundamental knowledge, and search after these hidden virtues which the Creator had placed in Metals and Minerals. The more I sought into them, the more I found, one Secret still flowing from another: God prospered my endeavours, that I tryed many things, and my eyes also saw these virtues, which Nature had infused into Metals and Minerals, yea, various, that they are not easily understood by the ignorant and sloth-full. Amongst all these I happened on a certain Mineral, composed of many colours, and of very great power in Art, I extracted its spiritual Essences and thereby in a few days I restored my sick brother to his former health; for this spirit was so strong, thai it did much revive or fortifie the spirit of my brother, who as long as he lived daily prayed for me for he lived long after, anc then bid me farewell. His and my prayers do so much prevail, ths the Creator, discovered, and by reason of my diligence did demon-strate unto me, even that, which yet remains hid to the wise men, as they call themselves. So therefore in this treatise will I declare and so far as is lawful for me to do, reveal, the Stone of the Ancients granted unto man for the health and comfort of man in this valley of misery, as the chiefest of all Earthly Treasure, writing these things not for my own but the benefit of posterity, following therein the method I find in the writings of many very learned men, so that by my-writings, the'dictates of Philosophy which are very short and Enigmatical, thou maist attain thrt rock on which truth depends, with a temporal reward and eternal bless-ings.

Dear Friend and lover of Art, in ray Preface I promised to show unto thee, and to such others who are very desirous to learn the Properties of Nature, and diligent searchers into Art, that Corner Stone, and that Rock, so far as I am permitted from above, as our Ancestors the Ancients prepared their Stone, which they attained from the most High, for the preservation of their health, and for their benefit in this present world. That I may therefore perform my promise, and not lead thee into Labrinths by Sophistic errors, I will reveal unto thee the fountain of all good things; therefore observe my following words, and diligently weigh them, if thou have a desire to learn this Art: I shall not use much Eloquence, that this not my intent, very little will be learned from that, I delight in brevity, which shall contain the fountain of the matter. Know, that very few have attained unto the possession of this magistery, although many have laboured and wrought in our stone, but the true knowledge and obtaining thereof, the Creator has not made common, but will grant the same to such as are averse to lies, and love the truth, and which with humble hearts most diligently seek the said Art, especially to such who love God unfeignedly, and pray unto him therefore. Wherefore I tell thee for a truth, if thou wouldst make our great and ancient stone, follow my Doctrine, and above all things pray to the Maker of every Creature, that he may bestow on thee his grace and blessing to that end; and if you have sinned, confess and deal righteously, and resolve upon it, that you sin no more, but live holily, that your heart may be filled with every good ~ thing; and remember when ye are preferred in honours, to be help-ful to the poor and indigent, that you deliver them from their miseries, and refresh them with your bountiful hand, that you may obtain the greater blessing from the Lord,' and through the Confirm-ation of faith receive your Throne in Heaven prepared for you. Ib2."},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":"My friend despise not, nor contemn the real writings of such men, who had the Stone before us; for next unto Revealation of God I obtained it from them, and let the reading of them be many times and very often reiterated, least you forget the foundation, and the truth be extinguished as a lamp. Then be not unmindful of your diligent labour, always seeking in the writings of Authors; and be not of an unstable mind, but rely on that fixed Rock, wherein all wise men do unanamiously concur, for a wavering man is soon led into a wrong way, and precipates himself into many errors;and men of wavering minds seldome build firm houses. Seeing our most ancient Stone arises not from combustible things, because it is free from all danger of the fire, therefore seek not for it, in such things, wherein Nature will not have it to be found or to be, as if one should tell thee it is a vegetable work, it is not, although a vegetative nature be in it. For note, if it should be with our Stone, as it is with an herb, it would easily be consumed in the fire, and nothing would remain but its Salt, and although those before me, have written many things of the vegetable Stone, yet know, my friend, that it will be difficult for thee to understand it, for because our Stone, does vegetate, and multiply itself, therefore have they called it vegetable. Know further,that brute Animals have no increase but in their like nature; therefore need you not search after, nor presume to make the true Stone, but of its own proper seed. Whereof our Stone has been made from the beginning: Also, my friend, take notice and understand, that you take not any Animal Soul for this work. For flesh and blood, as they are granted and bestowed by the Creator upon Animals, do properly belong unto Animals which with God has formed them, so that an Animal is made thereof; but our Stone which from the Ancients came to me as an inheritance, proceeds and arises from two and from one thing, which contains a third concealed, this is the pure truth and rightly spoken; for 183."},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"male and female by the Ancients were taken for one body, not by reason of the outward appearance to the eye, but in respect of that love implanted, and from the beginning infused into them, by the operation of Nature, that they may be known to be one, and as the two do propagate and increase their seed, so also the seed of the Matter, whereof our Stone is made, may be propagated and aug-mented. If you are a true lover of our Art, you will much esteem and wisely consider this saying, lest you fall and slip with other blind sophisters into the pit prepared by the enemy. My friend, that you may understand from whence this seed comes, enquire of thyself to what end thou would prepare the Stone, then will it be manifest unto thee, that it proceeds from no other matter, then from a certain metallic root, from whence also, the metals themselves, by the Creator, are ordained to proceed, which how it is done, Note, that in the beginning, when the Spirit moved upon the waters, and all things were covered with darkness, then the omnipotent and eternal God, whose beginning and whose wisdom without end, was from eternity, by his unsearchable counsel, did create the Heaven and the Earth, and all things visible and invisible in them contained, out of nothing, by what names so even they are called, for God made all things of nothing. But how this most glorious Creation was done, I shall not now treat, let the Scriptures and faith judge thereof. The Creator in the Creation gave to every Creature a peculiar seed, that there, should be an encrease (lest they should tend to a conclusion or detriment) whereby Men, Animals, Vegetables, and Metals might be preserved. Neither is it lawful to man, to produce a new seed at his pleas-ure, but is against God's ordinance, for to him is granted pro-pagation and increase; for the Creator has reserved to himself the power to create seed, else were it possible for Man to act as Creator also, which must not be, but is proper to the highest power. 18^."},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"Then conceive thus of the seed proceeding from Metals, that the Celestial influence, according to Gods good pleasure and ordin-ance , descends from above, and mixes itself with the Astral pro-perties, for when such conviction happens, then these two beget an earthly substance, as a third thing, which is the beginning of our seed, its first original, whereby may be demonstrated the antiquity of its generation, from which three the elements do arise and proceed, as water, agree and earth, which work further by a subterranean fire, until it bring forth a perfect thing, which HERMES, and all others before me, have called the three first principles, because we could find no more from the beginn-ing of the Magistery, and they are found to be an intrinsick Soul, an impalpable Spirit, and a corporeal and visible essence. Now when these three do dwell together, they do proceed by cop-ulation, by success of time, by VULCANS help into a palpable sub-stance, viz., into Mercury, Sulphur, and Salt, which three if by commixition, they are brought to induration and coagulation, as Nature does many ways operate, then is there made a perfect body, as Nature' would have it, and its seed is chosen and ordained by the Creator. Whosoever thou art that presumes to dive into the fountain of our work, and hopes to obtain, by thy ambitious enterprise, the reward of Art, I tell thee by the eternal Creator, for a truth of all truths, that if there be a Metallic Soul, a Metallic Spirit, and a Metallic form of body, that there must also be a Metallic Mercury, a Metallic Sulphur, and a Metallic Salt, which of necess-ity can produce no other than a perfect Metallic Body. If you do not understand this that you ought to understand you are not adepted for Philosophy, or God conceals it from thee. Therefore in brief thus, it will not be possible for tnee to attain this end with profit in a Metallic way, unless you can conjoin the said three principles into one, without error.

Therefore man by reason of his Soul is esteemed a fixed Creature (although he die a temporal death) yet shall he live forever; for mans death is only a clarification, that by certain degrees ordained of God he might be freed from his grievous sins, and transplanted into a better state, which happened not to other Animals, therefore are they not esteemed fixed Creatures, for after their death, they enjoy no Resurrection, for they want a rational Soul, for which the only and true Mediator the Son of God has shed his blood. A Spirit may abide in some certain body, but it does not there-fore follow, that it is there to be fixed, although that body agree with the Spirit, and the Spirit be not angry with the body, for they both want that strong part which overcomes and confirms the body and Spirit, and preserves and defends it from all dangers, viz., the most precious, noble, and fixed Soul: But where the Soul is wanting there remains no hope of Redemption; for anything without a Soul is imperfect, which is one of the highest mysteries which ought to be known to the wise and diligent seeker of our work: And my conscience will not suffer me to pass over this in silence, but to reveal it to those, who love the foundation of wisdom. There my beloved friend, be thou attentive to\"what I shall tell thee, that the Spirits hid in Metals are not alike, the one being more volatile, or more fixed than the other. So also are their Souls and bodies unequal; whatsoever Metal contains in itself all the three parts of fixity, that Metal has obtained"},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"that power to abide in the fire, and overcome all its enemies, which is only found in SOL: LUNA contains in itself a fixed Mer-cury, therefore she flys not so soon in the fire, as do the other imperfect metals, but abides her examen in the fire, and manifests it very nobly by her victory, that greedy SATURN cannot pary upon her. Amorous VENUS clothed and possessed with an abundant tincture, for her body is almost all a meer tincture, like in colour to that which is in the best metal, and by reason of its abundance of tincture appears to be red, but by reason her body is leprous, that firm permanent tincture cannot abide in an imperfect body, but is found to fly with the body; for when the body is consumed, the Soul cannot stay, but is forced to be gone and fly, because its habitation is consumed and destroyed by the fire, so that it can find no place nor knows where to tarry, but in a fixed body she willingly and constantly inhabits. Fixed Salt has given and left with warlike MARS a hard, con-stant , and gross body, whereby is manifested the generosity of his mind, from which warlike Captin can hardly anything be gotten, for his body is so hard that it can hardly be penetrated, but if his fierce valour be spiritually united with the fixity of LUNA, and the beauty of VENUS by a right mixture a curious harmony may be made, by which some KEYS may be so advanced, that the needy if he get up the highest step of the ladder, may get a living PART-ICULARITER, for the phlegmatic quality, or moist nature of LUNA ought to be dryed up by the ardent blood of VENUS, and its great blackness corrected by the Salt of MARS. There is no necessity for you to seek your seed in the Elements, for our seed is not put so far back, but there is a nearer place, where our seed has its certain habitation and lodging, so that if you only purifie the Mercury, Sulphur, and Salt, (of the Philo-sophers) so that of their Soul, Spirit, and Body be made an insep-arateble conjunction, which may never be separated the one from the other, nor can be divided, then is made the perfect bond of"},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"love, and a habitation is sufficiently and excellently prepared for the crown.

Although I could willingly out of love reveal more unto you, yet the Creator has prohibited me; wherefore it becomes me not to speak more clearly of these things, lest the gifts of the most High be abused, and that I should be the cause of committing of many sins, so that I should pull down Divine Vengence upon me, and with others be cast into eternal punishments.

Then MARS gathered his Champions together, and gave command that Mercury should be imprisoned, to whom VULCAN was appointed GAOLER, until he should be freed by some of the feminine kind. After these things were rumered abroad, the other Planets met together, and held a councel, they considered what was fit to be done that they might wisely proceed. Then SATURN the first in order with a fierce speech began to speak after this manner. I SATURN the highest Planet in the firmament, protest before you all my Lords, that I am the most unprofitable and contemptable of you all, of an infirm and corruptible body, of a black colour, obnoxious to the injuries of many afflictions in this miserable world, yet am the examiner of you all.

Saturn having ended his speech, brown JUPITER came on, and began his speech, with his bended knees, and with the reverent-ial honour of his Scepter, commending the requests of his fellow SATURN, commanding all such to be punished that should not put those things in execution and so he made an end. Then came MARS with his naked sword variously coloured, like a fiery glass, shining with diverse and strange rays, he brought this sword to VULCAN the GAOLER, to put therewith in execution all those things commanded by the Lords, which when he had killed MERCURY, he burnt his bones in the fire, wherein Vulcan the GAOLER was very obedient.

Then came dame VENUS in a garment of pure red, interwoven with green, of a most beautiful contentance, a most graceful and pleas-ant speech, and most amiable gesture, bearing most fragrant flowers in her hand, which by the variety of the colours did wonderfully refresh and delight the eyes of those that looked on her; she made intercession in the CHALDEAN Language, unto VULCAN as judge for liberty, and put him in remembrance, that Redemption must come from a woman kind; but his ears was stopt. In the mean time while these two thus conferred together, the heaven opened itslef, and thence came a great Animal with many thousands of young ones, driving away and expelling the Execut-ioner. He opened his jaws wide, devoured the precious Lady VENUS the interceeder crying with a loud voice, my descent is of woman, and woman have plentifully spread abroad my seed, and have filled the Earth with it; her Soul is kind to me, therefore will I feed and nourish myself with her blood: When this Animal had thus loudly spoken, he withdrew himself into a certain conclave, and shut the door after him, and all his young ones followed him in order, where they wanted much more food then before, and they drank of the foresaid incombustible oil, and they did easily digest their meat and their drank, and they had many more young ones than before, and this happened often, until they had replenished the whole world.

As Physicians dense and purifie the inward parts of the body, by means of their medicines, expelling all impurities from thence. So also ought our bodies to be purged and purified from all their impurities, that perfection may be wrought in our birth: Our Masters require a pure and undefiled body, which is not adulter-ated with any spot or strange mixture: For the addition of another thing is a Leprosie to our Metals. The Kings Diadem is made of pure gold, and a Chast Bride must be married unto him. Wherefore if you will work upon our bodies, take the most raven-ous grey Wolf, which by reason of his name is subject to valorous Mars, but by the Genesis of his Nativity he is the Son of old SATURN, found in the Mountains & in valleys of the world: He is very hungry, cast into him the Kings body, that he may be nour-ished by it; and when he has devoured the King, make a great fire, into which cast the Wolf, that he be quite burned, then will the King be at liberty again: When you have done this thrice, then has the Lion overcome the Wolf, neither can he find any of him to feed upon: And so is our body prepared for the beginning of our work.

Note this also, that wine contains a volatile Spirit,for in its distillation the Spirit first comes over, and then the phlegm: But if it be first by continual heat turned into Vinegar, its Spirit is not so volatile as before; for in the distillation of the vinegar, its water or phlegm comes first, and the Spirit last; and although it be the same matter that was before in the vessel, yet has it by far another property, being no more wine, but by the putrefaction of continual heat is transmuted and made Vinegar: And everything that is extracted and circulated with wine, or its Spirit, has a far different property and operation, then that which is extracted with Vinegar. For if the Vitrium of Antimony be extracted with wine, or Spirit of wine, it provokes many stools and vomits; because its poison and venom is not yet destroyed or extinct: But if the Vitrium of Antimony be extracted with good distilled Vinegar, it gives a fair extraction of a high colour: Then extract the Vinegar per M.B., and the yellow remaining powder being well edulcorated by'often washing with common water; that all acetosity be done away, then i it a sweet powder which does not excite any more stools, but is very excellent medicine for use, which exceeds even to admiration, and may be deservedly called the wonder of medicine."},{"pageNumber":244,"pageContent":"This wonderful powder in a moist place resolves into a liquor, which is of excellent use in Chirurgery, curing without any pain.

And although, as my conscience bears me witness before the High-est in the Heavens, to whom all secrets are manifest, I have written no untruths, but have made the truth itself so plain that understanding men need no more light. (For my Theory written for them, which was confirmed and made plain by the practice of the twelve keys, is sufficient.) Nevertheless the unquietness of my mind so wrought with me, through my various cogitations, that I undertook to add this small Tract, to demonstrate by a shorter way, and as it were by this means to purifie that burning light, whereby every lover of true wisdom, may have his desire the more fulfilled by that splendor and clearness.

For I have written nothing but what I shall bear witness unto after my death,and at the Resurrection of my body. You shall faithfully and truly find the shorter way, in the following discourse, for my sayings are founded In simplicity, and not in sophistical expressions. 231"},{"pageNumber":259,"pageContent":"I have mentioned and demonstrated,\" that all things are made and compounded of three Essences, viz., of Mercury, Sulphur, and Salt; and it is true what I have said. But know this, that the Stone is made of one, two, three, four, and five: Of five, that is,\" the quintessence of its matter, of four, are understood the four elements; of three, they are the three prin-cipals of all things; of two, for that is the double mercurial sub-stance; of one, that is the ENS PRIMUM of all things, which flowed from the FIAT of the first Creation. Many well minded Artists may be doubtful by all these sayings, to attain the foundation and understanding of the following discover-ies, therefore I shall first very briefly speak,' of Mercury; sec-ondly, of Sulphur; thirdly, of Salt, for these are Essences of our matter of the Stone. First know, that no common Argent vive is fit for our use; but our Argent vive is made of the best metal by the spagyric Art, pure, sub-tile, clear, splendent, as a fountain, transparent as Christal, with-out any impurity; of this make a water or incombustible oil; For Mercury was at the first water, as all Philosophers agree to this my saying and doctrine. In this Mercurial Oil, dissolve its proper Mercury, out of which the water was made, and precipitate that Mercury with its proper oil, then have you a double Mercurial substance; and know that your Gold must first be dissolved in a certain water, expressed in my second key, after its purification, as in the first key, and must be red-uced into a subtile Calx, as is mentioned in the fourth key; and then the said Calx must be sublimed by Spirit of Salt, and pre-cipitated again; and by reverberation reduced into a subtile pow-der: Then its own proper Sulphur will the more readily and easily into its own substance, and be in amity with it, for they wonder-fully love each other. So have you two substances in one, and is called the Mercury of the Philosophers, and yet is but one substance, that is, the first ferment."},{"pageNumber":260,"pageContent":"Now follows what is to be said of Sulphur. Your Sulphur you must seek in the like metal, then you must know how to extract it out of the body of the metal by purification, and destruction of its form and reverberation, without any corros-ives, whereof I gave you a hint, and minded you of it also in the third key: Then dissolve the Sulphur in its own proper blood, whereof it was made before its fixation,according to its due weight shown in the sixth key; then have you nourished and dissolved the true Lion, with the blood of the green Lion; for the fixt blood of the red Lion, is made out of the volatile blood of the green Lion; therefore are they of one nature. And the volatile blood makes the fixed blood volatile, and the fixed likewise makes the volatile blood fixed, as it was before its solution. Then set them together in a gentle heat, until the whole Sulphur be dis-solved; then have you the second ferment, nourishing the fixed Sulphur with the volatile, as all Philosophers agree with me herein. This afterwards is driven over with Spirit of wine, red as blood, and is called AURUM POTABLE, whereof there is no reduction to a body. I will also give you my opinion of the Salt of the Philosophers. Salt makes fixt and volatile, according as in its degree it is ordered and prepared: For the Spirit of Salt of Tartar, if it be drawn PER SE, and without addition, makes all metals volatile by resolution and putrefaction; and resolves them into a true vive, or current Mercury, as my practical doctrine holds forth. Salt of Tartar PER SE fixes most firmly, especially if the heat of CALX VIVE be incorporated with it, for both these have a sing-ular degree of fixing. So also the vegetable Salt of wine both fixes and makes volatile according to the .divers preparation thereof, as its use requires,"},{"pageNumber":261,"pageContent":"which certainly is a great mystery of Nature, and a wonder of the Philosophic Art. If a man drink wine, and out of his urine a clear Salt tie made, that is volatile, and makes other fixed things volatile, and carries it over the helm with it, \"but fixes not; and although the man drink nothing but wine, out of whose urine the Salt was made, yet it has another property, than the Salt of tartar, or of the feces of wine: For there is made a transmutation in the body of man, so that out of a vegetable, that is, out of Spirit of wine, an animal Spirit of Salt is made, horses by the corroboration of their natural virtue, do transmute, oats, hay, and such like, and convert it into fat flesh; so does the bees make honey out of the best of flowers of herbs. So understand of other things: This key and cause consists only in putrefaction, from whence such a separation and transmutation takes its original. The Spirit of common Salt, which is drawn after a peculiar manner makes Gold and Silver volatile, if a small quantity of the Spirit of the DRAGON be added to it, it dissolves it, and carries it over with it PER ALEMBICUM, as also does the EAGLE with the DRAGONS Spirit, which dwells in stony places; but if any thing be melted with Salt, before the Spirit be separated from its body, it fixes much more than it volatilizes. This I further tell you, if the Spirit of common Salt be united with Spirit of wine, and both be three times distilled over together, then it waxes sweet, and looses its acrimony: This prepared Spirit does not corporally dissolve Gold; but if it be poured on a pre-pared Calx of Gold, it extracts its highest tincture and redness; which if it be rightly done, it reduces pure and white LUNA into the same colour whereof its body was, before it was extracted: Also the old body will again attain its colour by the love of enticing VENUS, being descended from the same original, state and blood, whereof this is not a place to speak any further.

Sulphur is plentifully found in the propriety of most precious VENUS, which inflames the fixed blood gotten of her: The Spirit of the Philosophic Salt gives victory to coagulation, although the Spirit of Tartar, and Spirit of Urine, together with the true ACETUM may do much: For the Spirit of Vinegar is cold, and the Spirit of Calx Vive is very hot, there-fore are they esteemed and found to be of contrary natures: Now I speak not according to the Philosophic custom: But it does not become me to discover more plainly, how the inner doors are locked. This I faithfully tell you for a farewell: Seek your matter in a Metalline substance, make thereof Mercury; which ferment, with Mercury: Then a Sulphur, which ferment with its proper Sulphur, and with Salt reduce it into Order, distill them together, con-join them all according to their due proportion, then will it become that one thing, which before came from one; coagulate and fix it by a continual heat; then multiply and ferment it three times, according to the doctrine of my two last keys, then shall you attain and find the end and conclusion of your desire: The use of the tincture, the twelfth key, has absolutely the certain process, without any doubtful expressions.

In the same condition we find ANTIMONY, it is very difficult to find out all the myst-eries that are hid therein; its virtue is miraculous, its power is great, its colour hidden therein; is various, its crude body is poisonous, yet its essence is an antidote against poison, is like unto Quick-silver, which ignorant physicans can neither com-prehend, nor find; but the knowing physicians, believing it ^o be true, as having made many experiments with it. This Mineral contains much of Mercury, much of Sulphur, and little of Salt, which is the cause why it is so brittle and app-liable: For there is no malleableness in it, by reason of the"},{"pageNumber":266,"pageContent":"small quantity of Salt, the most amity it bears unto SATURN is by reason of MERCURY: For Philosophers Lead is made out of it, and is affected unto Gold, by reason of its Sulphur: For it purges Gold, leaving no impurity in it; there is an equal operation in it with Gold, if well prepared, and ministered to man medicinally: It flies out of the fire, and keeps firmly in the fire, if it be prepared accordingly. Its volatile spirit is poisionous, purges grieviously not without damage unto the body; its remaining fixed-ness purges also, but not in that manner, as the former did, pro-vokes not to stool, but seeks meerly the disease, where ever it is, penetrating all the body, and the members thereof, suffers no evil to abide there, expells it, and brings the body to a better condition. In brief, ANTIMONY is the Lord in Medicinals, there is made of it a REGULUS out of Tartar and Salt, if at the melting of Anti-mony some iron filings be added, by a manual used, there comes forth a wonderful Star, which Philosophers before me, called the SIGNET-STAR: This Star being several times melted with cold EARTH-SALT, it grows then yellowish,is of a fiery quality, and of a wonderful efficacy: This Salt afterwards affords a LIQUOR, which further is brought to a fixed incombustible oil, which serves for several uses. Besides, there are made of common REGULUS of Antimony curious flowers, either red, yellow, or white, according as the fire has been governed. These flowers, being extracted, and the extract, without any addition PER SE being driven into an oil, have an admirable efficacy. This extraction may be made also with Vinegar of crude Antimony, or of its REGULUS; but it requires a longer time; neither is it so good as the former preparation. And being reduced into a PHILISTEA, there is a glass made of it PER SE, of which I made mention in my eighth key, which is extracted also; then abstract-ed there remains a powder of incredable operation, which may safely be used, after it has been edulcorated. This powder, being dissolved,"},{"pageNumber":267,"pageContent":"heals wounds, sores, etc., causing no pains: This powder being extracted once more with Spirit of wine, or driven through the helmet, with some other matter, affords a sweet oil; to speak further of it is needless. Antimony is melted also with cold EARTH-SALT, dissolved, and digested for a time in Spirit of wine, it affords a white, fixed powder, is effectual against MORBUS GALLICUS, breaks inward im-postums; it has several virtues besides. You must learn to prepare Antimony yourself, lay hands on, dive into its inward qualities, you will meet with wonderful matters: For my conscience will not suffer me to discover all its qualities I desire not to load the physicans curses upon me, which were at great expences, and toiled much in burning of coals about its pre-paration, if I should rob them of their lively-hood. Therefore learn this also, as thy predecessors did; seek as I have done; then you will find also, what others have told of. There is made an oil also of Antimony, the flying Dragon being added thereunto, which being rectifyed thrice, then is it pre-pared: Though a CANCER were never so bad, and the WOLF never so biting, yet these with all their fellows, be they FISTULA*S, or ol' ulcers, must fly and be gone: The little powder of the flying Dragon prepared with the Lions blood, must be ministered also; three, or four grains for a dose, according to the parties age and complexion. A further process may be made with this oil with the addition of a water, made of Stone Serpents, and other necessary Spices; not those which are transported from the Indies: This powder is of that efficacy, that it radically cures many Chronical diseases. There is made a red oil of Antimony, Calx vive, Sal-armoniac, and common Sulphur, which has done great cures in old ulcers: With Stone Salt, or with common Salt, there is forced from Anti-mony a red Oil, which is admirable good for outward symptoms. There is made a sublimate of Antimony, with Spirit of Tartar and Salmiac, being digested for a time, which, by means of MARS,"},{"pageNumber":268,"pageContent":"is turned into quick Mercury. This Antimonial Mercury has \"been sought of many, \"but few have gotten it: Which is the reason why its praise is not divulged, much less is its operative quantity known: If you know how to precipitate it well, then your Arrow will hit the mark, to perform strange matters; its qualities ought not to \"be made common. It is needless to describe its combustible Sulphur, how that is made of Antimony, it is easy and known: But that which is fixed, is a secret, and hidden from many. If an oil be made of it, in which its own Sulphur is dissolved, and these be fixed together, then you have a Medicine of rare qualities, in virtue, operation, and ability far beyond vegetables. Quick-silver being imbibed with quick Sulphur, melted with Anti-mony for some hours in a wind oven, the Salt of the remainder being extracted with distilled Vinegar, then you have the PHILO-SOPHERS SALT, which cures all manner of Agues. There is an ACETUM made of Antimony, of an acidity, as other ACETUMS are; if its own Salt be dissolved in the ACETUM, and dis-tilled over, then this ACETUM is sharpened, which is an excellent cooler in hot swellings, and other inflamed symptoms about wounds, especially if there be made an unguent of it together with ANIMA of Saturn. The Quintessence of Antimony is the highest Medicine, the noblest and subtilest found in it, and is the fourth part of an UNIVERSAL Medicine. Let the preparation of it be still a mystery, its quan-tity, of dose is three grains, there belong four instruments to the making of it, the furnace is the fifth,in which VULCAN dwells, the Manuals, and the government of fire afford the ordering of it. You Physicians, if you be wise, seek out this Medicine in that subject, where it lies in, and may be found best,and most effect-, ual.

If I could prevail with APOLLO to he merciful, and to give lib-erty to his MUSE to be my assistance in the describing of Art and Wisdom, then would I bring in an offering unto MINERVA, whereby the Gods of Wisdom might take notice of a grateful mind for their gifts they had bestowed; and I would write of a mineral, whose Salt is set forth in the highest manner, whose great and good qualities are of that transcendency,' that reason is not able to comprehend, or to conceive of them. It went generally by the name of Copper-water, to make the meaning and sense of it plain; let men know, and be thus informed of it, that VITRIOL contains two Spirits, a white, and a red one: The white Spirit is the white Sulphur upon white,' the red Spirit is the red Sulphur upon red; he that hath ears let him hear! Observe diligently, and remember every word, for they are of a large extent, every word is as ponderous as a center Stone. The white Spirit is sour, causes an appetite, and a good digest-ion in a mans stomach. The red Spirit is yet sourer, and is more ponderous than the white, in its distilling a longer fire must be continued, because it is fixed in its degree. Of the white by distilling of Sulphur of LUNA is made ARGENTUM POTABLE. In like manner the Gold, being destroyed in the Spirit of common Salt, and made Spiritual by distilling^' and its Sulphur taken from it, and joined with a red Spirit in a due dose, then it may be dis-solved, and then for a time putrified in Spirit of wine, to be further digested, and often abstracted,' that nothing remain in the bottom, then you have made AURUM POTABLE, of which great vol-umes have been written, but very few of their processes were right. Note, that the red Spirit must be rectified from its acidity, and be brought into a sweetness, subtilly penetrating of a pleasant taste and sweet fragrancy. I have told you now great matters, which slipped from me against my intention, the sweet Spirit is made of Sulphur of Vitriol,"},{"pageNumber":270,"pageContent":"which is combustible, like other Sulphur, before it is destroyed: For the Sulphur of Philosophers, (note it well) is not combustible its preparation needs not to be set down, being easy, requiring no great pains nor great expense, to get a combustible Sulphur out of Vitriol. This sweet Oil is the essence of VITRIOL, and is such a Medicine which is worthy the name of the third Pillar of the Universal Medicine. The Salt is drawn from COLCHOTAR, and is distilled again, if it be fermented with VENUS, it performs its office very well: For it affords such a Medicine, which at the melting tinges pure iron into pure copper. COLCHOTAR of Sulphur affords true fundamentals unto healing of perished wounds, which otherwise are hardly brought to any heal-ing: And such sores, which by reason of a long continued white redness will admit of no healing,\" COLCHOTAR affords, an ingress thereunto, setting a new foundation; that quality and virtue is not in the COLCHOTAR, but the Spirit together with the Salt are the Masters which dwell therein. There is made of Copper and Verdigreece a Vitriol of a high degree, and is far spread in its tincture: There is a Vitriol made of iron also, which is of a strange quality: For iron and copper are very nigh kind one to another, belong together, as man and wife, this mystery should have been concealed, but being it is of great concernment, I could not forbear but to speak of it. Vitriol is corroded with Sal-armoniac, in its sublimation there arises a combustible Sulphur, together with its Mercury, of which there is but little, because it has most of Sulphur. If the same Sulphur be set at liberty again by the EAGLE, with Spirit of wine, there can be made a Medicine of it, as I told you formerly of it. Though there be a nearer way to make a combustible Sulphur out of Vitriol, as of its precipitation upon a precedent dissolution, by the Salt, or liquor of Tartar, as also by a common LIXIVIUM made of BEECH-ASHES; yet this is the best reason, because the 2^3."},{"pageNumber":271,"pageContent":"body of Vitriol is better, and more opened with the key of the EAGLE. There are other mysteries hidden in Vitriol, which in your operative quality are excellent, and are known apparently, as VENUS and MARS bear real record in their Spirits, the same does knowledge SOL and LUNA: But I do not intend at this time to write a perfect book of CHIRURGERY: And to make relations of particulars, in commendation of Vitriol: I have already written too much of it, you are to learn and search also; you will find that Vitriol needs no Proctor to speak for it, and it will suff-iciently inform you of an absolute Chirurgick book, contained in its nature as a third part of the UNIVERSAL, against all manner of diseases. In the closing hereof I tell you this much, that there is not found in its nature, neither cold or moist quality, but is of a hot and dry substantial quality, and is the reason, why by its superabounding calidity it heats other things, digesting them, and at last it brings them to a full maturity, the fire being continued for a certain time. The things I write of Vitriol, I have not begged or borrowed from other mens writings, but found them so in my long continued practice, whereby nature enabled me to become a SOOTHSAYER, by permission of the highest Creator, that that nobly implanted qual-ity might be avouched by a faithful and true evidence of one of her devoted disciples. And I speak thus much for a MEMORANDUM, that if PARIS can keep safely HELENA without troubles, that the noble City of TROJA in GREECE be no more ruined and destroyed, and PRIAMUS together with MENLAUS be no more afflicted and distracted thereby, then HECTOR and ACHILLIES will agree well enough, to obtain that royal race, without going to war for it, and be POSSESSORS of that Monarchy in their childrens children, and their off-spring and posterity for the enlarging of their Dominions, by increasing their riches infinitely, against which no enemy dares stir."},{"pageNumber":272,"pageContent":"OF COMMON SULPHUR. The usual common Sulphur is not so perfectly exalted in its degree, and \"brought unto maturity, as it is found in Antimony and Vitriol, there is made of it PER SE, an Oil against putrid stinking wounds, destroying and killing such worms, which grow in them; especailly if that little Salt in it \"be dissolved from the Sulphur.

If you digest in this essence of Sulphur,\" Myrrhe, Aloes, and other spices, it extracts their virtues, and makes it into a Balsom, which suffers no flesh, or other parts that are subject unto putrifaction, to fall into rottenness, for which cause the Ancients have put the name to it: BALSAMUS MORTUORUM.

OF CALX VIVE. The secrets of Quick-lime is known to few men, and few there are, which attained to a perfect knowledge of its qualities: But I tell you a real truth, that though Lime is contemptible, yet there lies great matters therein, and requires an understanding Master, to take out of it what lies buried in it: I mean to ex-pell its pure Spirit, which collaterally stands in affinity with Minerals: For it is of a fiery essence, heats, concocts, and brings unto maturity in short time, when in many years they could not be brought to it: The gross earthly body of it does not do the feat, but its Spirit does it, which is drawn out of it: This Spirit is of that ability, that he binds and fixes other volatile Spirits. For note, the Spirit dissolves OCULI CANCRORUM, dissolves crystals into a liquor: These two being brought into an unite PER MODUM DISTILLATIONIS (I will say nothing at this time of Diamonds and such like stones) that water dissolves and breaks the stone of the bladder, and the Gouty Tartar settled into the joints of hands and feet, suffer not any gout to take root in these parts, this rare secret I taught one of my faithful Disciples; and the great Chancellor of the invincible CEASAR, is still thankful unto me for it, and many great persons besides."},{"pageNumber":274,"pageContent":"Quick-lime is strengthened, and made more fiery, and hot, \"by a pure unsophistcated Spirit of wine, which is often poured on it, and abstracted again, then the white Salt of Tartar must \"be ground with it, together with its additionals, which must \"be dead, and contain nothing, then you will draw a very hellish Spirit, in which great mysteries lye hid. How this Spirit is gotten, I told you, observe it, take it for a fare-well. OF ARSENIC . Arsenic is in the kindred of Mercury and Antimony, as a bastard in a family may be: Its whole substance is poisonous and volatile, even as the former two, in its external colour to the eye, it is white, yellow, and red, but inwardly it is adorned with all manner of colours, like to its Metals, which it was fain to forsake, being forced thereunto by fire. It is sublimed PER SE, without addition, and also in its subliming there are added several other matters, as occasion requires. If it be sublimed with Salt and Mars then it looks like a transparent crystal, but its poison stays still with it, unfit to be joined, or added to Metals, has very little efficacy to transmute any metal. The subterranean Serpent binds it in the union of fire, but cannot quite force it, that it might serve for a Medicine for man and beast, if it be further mixed, with the Salt of a vegetable Stone, which is with Tartar, and is made like -unto an Oil, it is of great efficacy in wounds, which are of a hard healing; it can make a Coat for deceitful VENUS to trim her handsomely, that the inconstancy of her false heart may be disclosed by her wavering servant, without gain, with her prejudice and damage. When ANTIMONY and MARS are made my companions, and am exalted by them to the top of OLYMPUS, then I afford a Ruby in transpar-ence and colour to that, which comes from ORIENT, and am not to be esteemed less than it: If I am proved by affliction, then I fall"},{"pageNumber":275,"pageContent":"off like a flower, which is cut off and withers: Therefore nothing can \"be made of me, to fix any Metal, or tinge it to any profit, \"because I forsook my \"body totally, and distributed my coat, to play, and lots to \"be cast for it: Therefore let no man neither praise or dispise me, unless he have for very hunger taken a pound of me into the \"body; through it he gets an antidote to save his life; however, he shall get nothing out of Metals by it: In other things he may have a Treasure in it, unto which few are comparable to it. I, Arsenic say of myself at the closing hereof, that it is a very difficult thing, to find my right and due preparation, my operation is felt exceedingly, if made tryal of, and is a great danger, if ignorant men make use of me: He that can be without me, let him go to my kindred: And if you can equalize me with them, that I may share with them in the inheritance, then all the world shall acknowledge, that my descent is from their blood: But it is a very hard task for any man, to set a sheperd into a royal seat to make him King. But Patriarchs being descended from shep-herds, and were preferred to royal dignities, I will therefore prescribe no limits, nor pass any judgement: For wrong and right may be found in this leaf. However, take you notice, that I am a poisonous volatile bird, have forsaken my dearest, and most confiding friend, and separated myself as a Leper, which must live aloof of from other men. Cure me first of my infirmity, then I shall be able to heal those, which have need of me, that my praise may be confirmed by poison, and my name for an everlasting remembrance, to the honour of my Country, is nothing inferior unto MARCUS CURTIUS, and it will be found in the end, in what manner HANNIBAL and SCIPIO were re-conciled."},{"pageNumber":276,"pageContent":"OF SALTPETER . Two Elements are predominant in me, as fire and air, the lesser quantity is water and earth: I am fiery, \"burning, and volatile. There is in me a subtile Spirit,\" I am altogether like unto Mer-cury, hot in the in-side, and cold in the out-side,' am slippery and very nimble at the expelling of my enemies.

Sal-armoniac is none of the meanest Keys; to open Metals thereby Therefore the Ancients have compared it with a volatile Bird, it must be prepared, else you can do no feats with it; for if it be not prepared, it does more hurt than good unto Metals, carries them away out at the chimney-hole; it can elevate and sublime with its swift wings the tincture of Minerals, and of some Metals, to the very mountains, where store of snow is found, usually even at the greatest heat of summer, if it be sublimed, with common Salt, then it purges and clears, and may be used safely. He that supposes to transmute Metals with this Salt, which is so volatile, surely he does not hit the nail on the head, for it has no such power: But to destroy Metals, and make them fit for transmutation, in that respect it has sufficient power: For no metal can be transmuted, unless it be first prepared thereunto. My greater strength which lies in me, may be drawn from me by subliming and cementing. The greatest secret in me you will find, when I am united with HYDRA, which is to devour and swallow me, that I also may turn with her to be a water serpent, then have I prepared a bath for the NYMPHA, and have gotten power to make ready a crown for the King, that the same may be adorned with jewels, and may with honour and glory be set on his head. OF TARTAR. This Salt is not set down in the book of Minerals, but is gen-erated of a vegetable seed, but its Creator has put such virtue into it, that it bears a wonderful love and friendship unto^Metals making them malleable; it purges LUNA unto a whiteness, and in-corporates into her such additionals, which are convenient for her, being digested for a time with Minerals, or Metals, and then sublimed and vilified (vitrified?), they all come unto quick"},{"pageNumber":278,"pageContent":"Mercury, which to do, there is not any vegetable Salt beside it: Is not this a wonderful thing! That Oratour is yet to be born, which shall be of that ability and eloquence as to express suffic-iently all the mysteries hid in it. But to make out of it the Philosophers Stone, is no such matter: Being it is a vegetable, and that power is not given to any of the vegetables. It is in MEDICINA a very good remedy, to be used inwardly and outwardly; its Salt being made Spiritual and sweet, it dissolves and breaks the stone in the bladdar, and dissolves the coagulated Tartar of the Gout, settled in the joints, or any-where besides. Its ordinary Spirit, which is used for opening of Metals being used and applied outwardly, also lays a foundation for healing of such ulcers, which admit hardly any healing, as there are fistulas, cancers, wolves, and such like. I know nothing more to write of Tartar, for having separated itself, and left its noblest part in the wine. OF VINEGAR . In ALCHEMY and MEDICINA, nothing almost can be prepared, but Vinegar must set a helping hand to it. Therefore I thought it convenient to let it have its due praise and commendation, espec-ially to insert it here in this treatise. In ALCHEMY it is used to set Metals and Minerals into putrefaction. It is used also to extract their essences and tinctures, being first prepared thereunto, even as the Spirit of wine is usual to extract the tinctures from vegetables. In Physick it deserves its praise also, for it takes the pure from impure, and is a SEPARATER, and takes from the'Mineral Medica-ments their sharpness and corrosiveness, fixes that, which is volatile and is a great defendant against poison, as I told you, when I spoke of the Antimonial glass. Vinegar is used inwardly also, and both men and beast are benefited 251."},{"pageNumber":279,"pageContent":"thereby: Outwardly it is applied to hot inflammations and swellings for a cooler. Spirit of wine and Vinegar are of great use, both in Alchemy and Physick, both have descent from the wine, are of one substance; but differ in the quality, by reason of putrifact-ion, the Vinegar got there, of the which I told you formerly. I must acquaint you with one thing, which is this, that this is not the Philosophers Vinegar; our Vinegar, or ACETUM is• another liquor, namely a matter itself: For the Stone of Philosophers is made out of AZOT of Philosophers, which must be prepared with ordinary distilled AZOT, with Spirit of wine, and with other waters besides, and must be reduced into a certain order. Note this for a MEMORANDUM, if distilled pure Vinegar be poured upon destroyed SATURN, and is kept warm in MARIES-BATH, it loses its acidity altogether, is as sweet as any Sugar, then abstract two, or three parts of that Vinegar, set it in a Cellar, then you will find white transparent stones, like unto Crystals, these are an excellent cooler and healer of all adust and inflamed sym-ptoms. If these Crystals are reduced into a red Oil, and poured upon Mercury, precipitated by VENUS, and proceeded in further as it ought; if that be his rightly, then neither SOL nor LUNA will hinder thee from getting riches. OF WINE. The true Vegetable Stone is found in wine, which is the noblest of all Vegetables: It contains three sorts of Salt, three sorts of Mercury, and three sorts of Sulphur. The first Salt sticks in the wood of the wine, which if burnt to ashes, and a lixivium made of it to have its Salt drawn foith, which must be coagulated. This is the first Salt. The second Salt is found in Tartar, if that be incinerated, then draw its Salt forth, dissolve and coagulate it several times, and -let it be sufficiently clarified. 252."},{"pageNumber":280,"pageContent":"The third Salt is this, when the wine is distilled it leaves FECES behind, which are made to powder, its Salt can \"be drawn out with warm water. Each of these Salts has a special property: In their Center they stand in a harmony, \"because they descend from one root. It has three sorts of Mercury, and three sorts of Sulphur. The first Oil is made of the Stem, the second Oil is made out of crude Tartar, the third is the Oil of wine. There is a strange property in the Spirit of wine: For without it there cannot \"be extracted any true tincture of SOL, nor can there be made without it any true AURUM POTABLE: But few men know how a true Spirit of wine is made, much less can its property be found out wholly. Several ways have been tried to draw, and to get the Spirit of wine without sophistication, as by several instruments and dis-tillings with Metalline Serpents, and oiiier strange inventions, of sponges, papers, and the like. Some caused a rectified AQUA-VITA be frozen in the greatest frost, expecting the phlegm thereof should turn to ice, the Spirit thereof to keep liquid, but nothing was done to any purpose. The true way for the getting of it, I told you at the end of my manuals: For it must be 'subtile, penetrating, without any phlegm, pure, aerial, and volatile, so that air in a magnetic quality may attract it, therefore it had heed to be kept close in: It is of a penetrating and effectual operation, and its use is several. There are three, which are the noblest Creatures in the world, these three bear a wonderful affection one to another. Among Animals it is man, out of whose MUME is made an ANIMAL STONE, in which MICROCOSME is contained. Among Minerals Gold is the noblest, whose fixedness is a sufficient testimony of its noble off-spring and kindred. Among vegetables there lies hid a Vegetable Stone. Man loves Gold and wine above all other Creatures, which may be beheld with eyes. Gold loves Man and wine, because It lets go its noblest parts, if Spirit of wine be put to it, being made"},{"pageNumber":281,"pageContent":"potable, which gives strength to man, and prolongs his life in health. Wine bears affection to man also, and to Gold, \"because it easily unites with the tincture of SOL, expells melancholy and sadness, refreshes and rejoices mans heart. He that has these three Stones may \"boldly say, that he has the Stones of the UNIVERSAL, much of it is talked and written: But what eye has seen it; Not one amongst many hundred of Millions. These Stones renew men and \"beasts, cure leprous Metals, cause \"barrenness to \"become fertile, with a new \"birth, humane reason is not able to comprehend it,or conceive of it. If a rectified AQUIYITE be lighted, then Mercury and the veget-able Sulphur separates, that Sulphur burns bright, being a meer fire, the tender Mercury betakes himself to his wings and flys to his chaos. He that can shut up and catch this fiery Spirit, he may boast, that he has gotten a great victroy in the Chemical battle; for this vegetable fiery Sulphur is the only key to draw the Sulphur from Mineral and Metalline bodies. Thus I close my book, the things contained therein are not grounded on opinion, as most physicians rely on the Authors, that such and such herbs are cold and moist, dry, and warm, in the first, second, and third degree: Because they heard their Authors affirm it, themselves neither saw it, nor made trial of it: Making meer collections from other mens writings, patching up volumes. The things I wrote of, I know by long experimental knowledge, to be true: This my experience I hope will take place, and get the victory as the Amazons did in their prudence.

Therefore, if you have calcined the matter,\" then extract its Salt, rectifie it well, let it shoot into Vitriol, which must be sweet,\" without any corrosiveness, or sharpness of Salt. Thus you get the Philosophers Vitriol, or Philosophic Oil, make further of it a MERCURIAL water, thus you have performed an artifical works This is called the Philosophers AZOTH, which purges LATON, but is not yet washed, for AZOTH washes LATON, as the Ancient Philosophers have told two or three thousand years ago. For the Philosophic Salt, or LATON must with its own humidity, or its own Mercurial water be purged/ dissolved, distilled, attract its MAGNET, and stay with it. And this is the Philosophers Mercury, or MERCURIUS DUPLICATUS, and are two Spirits, or a Spirit and water of the Salt of Metals.

Hermes the Father of Philosophers had this Art, and was the first that wrote of it,' and prepared the Stone out of Mercury, Sol, and Luna, of the Philosophers: Whom many thousand laborators have initiated, myself also did the like: And I speak really, that the Philosophers Stone is composed of two bodies, the beginning and ending of it must be with Philosophic Mercury.

This is a Stone and no stone, of which is made a volatile fire, in form of a water, which drowns and dissolves its fixed Father, and its volatile Mother. Metalline Salt is an imperfect body, which turns to Philosophic Mercury, that is,' into a permanent, or blessed water: And is the Philosophers MAGNET, which loves Its Philosophic MARS, sticking unto him, and abides with him. Thus our SOL has a MAGNET also,\" which MAGNET is the first root and matter of our Stone: If you conceive of and understand my saying, then you are the richest man in the world.

Herein you must proceed Philosophically, you must well the Philosophers Mercury,and make Mercury with Mercury, adding the Philosophic Salt, ferment, or Sulphur of Philosophers, and proceed therein, as you heard formerly, then you have the Philosophers MAGNET, the Metalline Salt, or Philo-sophic Salt.

For I speak the highest truth unto thee, that neither the UNIVERSAL nor PARTICULAR TINCTURE, neither AURUM POTABLE, nor other UNIVER-SAL MEDICINE, without this Heavenly and spiritual essence, which 278."},{"pageNumber":306,"pageContent":"has its original from the Starry heaven, taking and receiving the same, from thence may be had and prepared, therefore be silent till death, at your departing lay down your talent, as I have done; for if I had not informed you faithfully, you would know but little of that mysterie, and continue still with the vulgar in folly, blindness, and madness, and you would have sent a recipe into the greasie and salvy shops of apothecaries, but where would thy Soul have gone after thy departure? Into GALENS lap, to the utmost depth of darkness, where the Devils have their dwelling places, even thither, both thy Soul and body would have been sent, in case thou should have divulged any of these secrets. To turn to my intended business, I will in the first place in-form you, what is that true and highest AURUM POTABLE, and UNI-VERSAL MEDICINE, after this in order there follows another AURUM POTABLE made of the fixed red SULPHUR,or Soul of the corporeal Gold, most highly purged, and is prepared with the conjunction of the UNIVERSAL SPIRIT OF MERCURY. After this there follows another PARTICULAR MEDICINE, which is half an AURUM POTABLE, show-ing its efficacy and power in many trials. Then I will add there-unto a description of AURUM POTABLE, because it traces the steps of Gold, and it shows wonderfully its great energy and virtues. The highest and noblest AURUM POTABLE, which the Lord God has laid into nature, is the excocted, prepared, and fixed substance of our Stone, before it is fermented. A higher, greater, and more excellent UNIVERSAL MEDICINE, and AURUM POTABLE cannot be found, nor had in the circumference of the whole world: For it is a heavenly Balsome, because its first principles, and original comes from heaven, made formal in earth, or underground, and is afterwards being exactly prepared, brought into a PLUSQUAM PERFECTION, of which first principles and Nativity of this hea-venly substance I have already written sufficiently, and count it needless to be repeated here. Now as this excocted and perfect substance is the highest, chiefest, and greatest UNIVERSAL MEDICINE unto man, even so on 279."},{"pageNumber":307,"pageContent":"the other side the same matter after its FERMENTATION, is a Tin-cture also, and the chiefest, greatest, and most powerful UNIVER-SAL MEDICINE upon all metals whatsoever, and thereby may be trans-muted into their highest melioration and health, namely into the purest Gold. This is the first, chiefest, and greatest AURUM POTABLE and UNIVERSAL MEDICINE of the whole world, of which alone great volumes could be written; whose preparation was set down circumstantially in the third part, needless to be repeated here again; at the present I will speak of the true and full PROCESS, how a true AURUM POTABLE is to be had, and prepared from Gold, which in the best manner is most exactly putrified. Take the extracted Soul of Gold, draw forth with the sweet Spirit of common Salt, as I informed you about the PARTICULAR of Gold, where the body of Gold appeared very white, abstract the Spirit of Salt from it, edulcorate the ANIMA of SOL ten or twelve times; at last let it be purely exiccated, weigh it, pour on it four times as much of Spirit of Mercury, lute it well, set it in the vaporous bath, putrifie it gently, let the ANIMA of SOL be quite dissolved, and be turned into a water, or its PRIMA MATERIA, both will turn into a blood-red liquor, fair and transparent, no Ruby on the earth is comparable unto it. But thus much you must note, when the ANIMA of SOL begins to be dissolved, and brought into its PRIMA MATERIA that at the first, on the side round the glass, where the matter lies, there be seen a green circle, on it a blue, then yellow, afterward all the colours of a Rain-bow, join, and make appearance, which do last but a little while. The ANIMA of SOL being wholly dissolved into the MERCURIAL SPIRIT, and nothing is seen in the bottom, then pour to it twice as much of the best rectified Spirit of wine, brought to its highest degree, the glass must be luted exactly, digest, and putrifie gently for twelve, or fifteen days, together, then ab-stract PER ALEMBICUM, that matter comes over in a blood-red trans-parent colour: This abstracting must be iterated, nothing must be"},{"pageNumber":308,"pageContent":"left in the bottom, which is corporeal, then you have the true AURUM POTABLE, which can never be reduced into a body. But note, the Gold before destruction and extraction of its Soul must be purged in the highest degree. There is made another AURUM POTABLE, and artifically prepared, which though it cannot be said, or set down in writing to be the full and true potable Gold, yet it is more than half an AURUM POTALBE counted, \"because it is transcending effectual in many diseases, in which nature might have stood in great doubts. This half AURUM POTABLE is made in a twofold manner, where the latter is \"better and more effectual than the former, and asks more pains and time than the former. Take this extracted Soul of Gold, drawn forth with the sweet Spirit of common Salt, edulcorate it most purely and exactly, at last exiccate it, put it in a spacious viol, or body of glass, pour on it red Oil of Vitriol, which was dephlegmed, and rectified PER RETORTAM, that it be transparent, clear, and white, and you may see, that it seizes on the Gold and dissolves it, and is tinged deeply red. Put so much of this Oil to it, that in it may be dissolved Sulphur, or the Soul of Gold, let it putrifie in BALNEO MARIE, put a reasonable fire to it, that you may see that the Soul of Gold is quite dissolved in the Oil of Vitriol: The FECES, which it has settled, must be separated from it, then put twice as much of the best rectified Spirit of wine to it, which rectification you shall be informed of in this part, seal the glass, let no Spirits of the wine evaporate, set it again in putrifaction in the Balneo, let it be there for a month, then the sharpness of Vitriol is mitigated by the Spirit of wine, and looses its acid-ity and sharpness, both together iuake an excellent Medicine, drive both over, let nothing stay behind in the bottom, then you get more than half an AURUM POTABLE, in form and colour of a deep yellow liquor. Note, that some Metals in this manner may be proceeded withal, first a Vitriol may be gotten out of the Metal,"},{"pageNumber":309,"pageContent":"than a Spirit is further driven from it, and joined in this manner with the Soul, dissolved, and further digested with Spirit of wine, all must enter together into a Medicine, as I told of for-merly, which have their special efficacy. The second way to prepare this half AURUM POTABLE, which though it he but half an AURUM POTABLE, yet in virtue and efficacy is far preferred before the other now spoken of, and is done as follows: Take the extracted SOLAR Soul spoken above, put it into a viol, pour on it the extracted Philosophic Sulphur, which is the second PRINCIPLE, which is drawn with Spirit of Mercury from the Philo-sophic earth, and Mercury, or the Spirit of Mercury, unto an Oleity, which now is Sulphur again, and must be abstracted gently PER MOLUN DISTILLATIONS. Of this Philosophic Sulphur pour on it as much, that the SOLAR Soul may be dissolved, let it stand in a gentle bath, let the dissolution be made, then pour more of the best Spirit of wine to it, digest gently, draw these over, let nothing stay behind in the bottom, then you have a Medicine, which does not want above two grains of the right and true AURUM POTABLE. These are the chiefest ways to make the corporeal AURUM POTABLE, this I close and proceed further with a short, but true process, how the Silver, which is the next to Gold, concerning perfection, is made potable also: This process must be done in the following manner. Take the sky-coloured Sulphur, or Spirit of LUNA, which was extracted with distilled Vinegar, as I informed you in the PART-ICULAR of LUNA, edulcorate it, rectifie it with Spirit of wine, exsiccate it, put it in a viol, pour to it three times as much of Spirit of Mercury, which is prepared from the white Spirit of Vitriol, as I faithfully taught you in that place, lute the glass firmly, set it in putrifaction in the vaporous bath, let all be dissolved, and nothing more seen in the bottom, then put to it an equal quantity of this Spirit of wine, set it in digestion for"},{"pageNumber":310,"pageContent":"half a month, drive all over, let nothing stay \"behind, then you have the true potable LUNA, which in its efficacy is admirable, and does wonders when it is used. A description of the Fiery Tartar. Distill of good wine a Spirit of wine, rectifie it with white calcined Tartar, let all come over, put that which is distilled over into a viol, put four ounces of well sublimed Sal armoniac to one quart of Spirit of wine, set a helmet upon, set a great receiver into cold water, drive, the volatile Spirits into, gently in BALNEO MARIE leave but a little quantity of it behind. Note the Alembick must always be cooled with wet cloths, then the Spirits will be dissolved, and turn to liquor. Thus is prepared this hot Spirit of wine. Of the Salt of Tartar. First you must note, that the Philosophers Tartar is not the vulgar tartar, wherewith the lock is opened, but it is a Salt, which comes from the root, and is the only mystical key for all Metals, and is prepared thuss Make a sharp LIXIVIUM of the ashes of SARMENTS (Garments?), or of twigs of the Vine, boil away all its moisture, there stays behind a ruddy matter, which must be reverberated for three hours in a flaming fire, stirring it still, let it come to a whiteness, which white matter must be dissolved in distilled Rain-water, let the FECES of it settle, filter, and coagulate them in a glass, that the matter in it be dry, which dry matter is the Salt of Tartar, from which the true Spirit is driven. Note, as I told now of the virtue and qualities of precious stones, so there are found also many dispicable, and ignoble 283."},{"pageNumber":311,"pageContent":"stones, which are of great virtues, and experimentally are known to be of rare qualities, which ignorant, and unexpert men will hardly give gredit unto, neither can they conceive of it in their dull reason and understanding: The same I will demonstrate with the example of CALX VIVE, which in mans judgement is held of no great value, and lyes contemptibly in obscurity, however there is a mighty virtue and efficacy in it, which appears, if applicat-ion be made of it to the most harmful diseases, seeing its tri-umphant and transcendent efficacy is almost unknown for the gener-ality, therefore for the good of such, which are inquisitive into natural and Supernatural mysteries, and to whom I disclose these mysteries in this my book, I will for a farewell discover also this mystery concerning the CALX VIVE, and will show in the first place, how its Spirit is driven from it, which work indeed re-quires an expert Artist, who is well informed aforehand of its preparation. Take unslaked Lime as much as you will, beat, and grind it on a well-dried stone, to an impalpable powder, put on it so much of Spirit of wine, as the pulverised Calx is able to drink, there must not stand any of that Spirit upon it, abstract the Spirit gently from it in BALNEO, this abstracting must be iterated eight, or ten times: This Spirit of wine strengthens the Spirit of Calx mightily, and is made more fiery hot. Take the remaining Calx out of the body, grind it very small, put to it a tenth part of Salt of Tartar, which is pure, not containing any FECES. As much as this matter weighs together, add as much of the addit-ional of Salt of Tartar thereunto, nemely the remaining matter, from which was extracted the Salt of Tartar, and it must be well exiccated, all this must be mingled together, and put in a well coated retort, three parts of the retort must be empty, take a great receiver, or body to it, very strongly. Note, the body into which the retorts nose is put, must have a pipe of a fingers breadth, unto which may be applied another body, and a quantity of Spirit of wine in it, then give a gentle fire to it, at first"},{"pageNumber":312,"pageContent":"there comes some of the phlegm, which falls into the first applied body: The phlegm being all come over, then increase the fire, there comes a white Spirit to the upper part of the body, like unto the white Spirit of Vitriol, which does not fall among the phlegm, but slides through the pipe into the other body, drawing itself into the Spirit of wine, embracing the same, as one fire does join with the other. Note, if the Spirit of Calx be not prepared first by the Spirit of wine, and drawn off and on, as I told, then he does not so, but falls among the phlegm where he is quinched, loosing all its efficacy. Thus difficult a matter is it, to search nature throughly, reserving many things unto herself. This Spirit being fully entered into the Spirit of wine, then take off the body, put away the phlegm, but keep carefully the Spirit of wine, and Spirit of Calx: And note, both these Spirits are hardly separated, because they embrace closely one another: And being distilled, they come over jointly. Therefore take these mixed and united Spirits, put them into a jar-glass, kindle it, the Spirit of wine burns away, the Spirit of Calx stays in the glass, keep it carefully. This is a great ARCANUM, few of other Spirits go beyond its efficacy, if you know how to make good use of it. Its qualities may hardly be set down in any way of'abridgement. This Spirit dissolves OCULI CANORORUM, the hardest crystals: These three being driven over together, and often iterated in that distilling, three drops of that liquor being ministered in warm wine, break, and dissolve any Gravel and Stone in mans body, expelling their very roots, not putting the patients to any pain. The Spirit of Calx at the beginning looks bluish, being gently rectified, looks white, transparent, and clear, leaving few FECES behind. This Spirit dissolves the most fixed jewels, and precious stones. On the other side he fixes all volatile Spirits with his transcendent heat. This Spirit conquors all manner of Podagrical Symptoms, be they never so nodose and tartarous, dissolves and expells them radically. 285."},{"pageNumber":313,"pageContent":"To the Omnipotent Trine God, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, \"be returned hearty thanks for all his \"benefits, which he has bes-towed on man, and discovered those Secrets, I wrought on in his name.

Those that seek Art, and have a desire to attain to wisdom, are to note, that the Highest, upon my continued prayers has granted unto me a Clergy-man, to make known the many and great mysteries of Nature: Among which mans body is one to be considered, how that is governed in imitation unto MICROSOSME, for it is meet that the lesser should imitate the greater, and the smallest and meanest ought to be governed by the greatest and most potent. MICROSOSME,or the great world contains three things, as the most principle, the rest, which came from these, are meerly accid-ental. In the first place is to be considered the matter and form of this world, which matter is made formal out of a non-shape, or a nothing, and the great Creator presently prescribed an order for this matter, what government it should keep, as soon as it came to a life, or motion. This matter and form is water and earth. For at the Creation, by a separation of the water from the earth, there was finished the matter and form, as two things belonging one to another, from these all Animals and Vegetables have their beginning, and other two things, as air and fire, which belong, one to another, have wrought life therein. The matter and form is earth, the Salt in that earth, the body: Even so is it with mans body, which is MICROCOSMUS. The matter was not perfect without the form, these joining into one, by Gods ordinance, the form being became quick, came then to a perfection: The matter and form got life by motion, air was the first cause of that mot-ion, and perfect maturity was caused by a convenient heat, move-ably inclosed in the air, thus the earth was brought to a fertil-ity by the air, it was opened, and became porous by motion for generation. The earth being impregnated, made her seed apparent by her aquosity, then air and heat in the neather and upper Region"},{"pageNumber":316,"pageContent":"of the Astrals caused that a \"birth was \"brought forth, the blossoms produced, and the appointed fruit was ripened by concoction of heat. Calcidity Is a Sulphureous hot Spirit, which like a Medicament exiccates the superfluous gross aquosity and phlegmatic matter, which in the generation at the beginning abounds too much in the earth, before the air could have a fellow dominion at the joining with it, carrying the same along in the superfluity of her birth. The second principle part of the MICROCOSME is INABILITY, for the matter in itself was without life, which by heat was stirred up, then the vital Spirit became to be sensible, which is in man a Sulphureous Spirit, kindling the body by a heat, exiccates the superfluity of the earth by the subtility of its substance, and governs the body in a constant motion. For after the heat is gone, no sensibleness felt in the pulse and arteries, and a dead body is found instead of life, at the departing of the warm Spirit of Sulphur; rational men ought to take this mystery into consider-ation. The two first elements, the matter and form, being apparent, and having gotten a mobility by the two last elements by light, the MICROSOSME was not yet perfect, the Creator allotted further an increase to the seed of the earth, as well as he did to veget-ables and animals. God allowed unto earth an imagination for all sorts of seeds, and to bring them forth after their several kinds. Then the earth was impregnated by imagination which God allotted, and the earth brought these seeds forth in mans presence, the heat digested them to maturity even till hitherto. Matter and form of the Microcosme being extant, consisting of earth and water, then the Creator caused a life into them by an inbreathed warm air, heating the cold earthly substance, giving a heat unto life and motion, which was the Soul, which is the true Sulphur of man, Spiritual, incomprehensible: Sensibly felt by its own operation. All this being finished, then God allowed an imagination unto good, in the perfect understanding of man, 289."},{"pageNumber":317,"pageContent":"that by his imagination he could judge of all the \"beasts, and impose on each a proper name, and by that imagination he learned to know his wife also, that she had flesh and bones of his body. Then man appeared perfect, and that matter was made into a shape, of a sensible body. This form being made alive by the Soul, had allowed further a subtile Spirit unto imagination and knowledge, which is an invisible, and incomprehensible form, like a work master, who frames all things in the mind, which has its habitation in the upper Region of the MICROSOSME, according to his volatility, and deserves the name of MERCURY, or the invisible Spirit of mans body. Form and matter is earthly, the life sticks in the motion, and the knowledge of every understanding unto good and bad stands in the sharp speculation of the MICROCOSM, the overplus found besides these three, nature casts off as CADAVE, and is as a mon-ster, which by these three is found to be a separation, and a CAPUT MORT. If glorified ELIAS were present, and the ASTRALS could speak, and silent nature had a tongue to express hereof, then I needed not to bring in any further evidence to persuade the incredulous who considered not judiciously this my saying: For a man possessed by blindness cannot pass any judgement upon my writings: But understanding judges impatience,and wisdom separates herself from folly by her own experience. This vital Spirit nourishes, feeds, and preserves himself by the Oleity of mans Sulphur, which is predominate in the blood and with, or through it does work in the whole body, that the substance may be perfect. This vital Spirit is Mercury, which is found in man, and is preserved by an Oleity of its likeness: Besides these two Mercury and Sulphur, there is a third thing in man, namely Salt, which lies ih the flesh, body, and bones. The Salt ministrates its noblest Spirit for a nourishment unto the blood, which fatness is found therein by the taste, and dis-perses itself throughout the body, preserves mans body like a Balsome from putrifaction, and is as the hand and copulation, 290."},{"pageNumber":318,"pageContent":"whereby MERCURY, or the Vital Spirit continues the longer with the Balsome in the flesh, and dwells together in one. For in the Salt there lies a Spirit, which must protect all other Bal-somes in their worth and dignity. The remainder found in the flesh, if these three be taken from it, is a dead thing, as I told you formerly, and is good for nothing, nor can it be used for anything. As this Union, Dominion, and Government is in man, the like are in Metals, Minerals, and Vegetables, which make up their perfect body, do live, keep, and are preserved in the like manner, as man is. As the one follows upon the other in man, according to order in the like condition are other Animals after their kind and pro-perty. As a cow is an animal, her food, as grass, is vegetable, this vegetable by the heat of the cows body is putrified, in that putrifaction is made a separation, which is the key of all dissol-utions and separations. Separation .being made, then goes the subtile Spirit, the subtile Sulphur, and the subtile Salt of the vegetables substance of the grass into all members of the whole body of the cow, the Spirit rules the beast, the Sulphur nourishes it, and the salt preserves it. This being done, then nature distributes her gifts further, making a new separation; as of the superfluousness, which the cow does not assume by way of assimilation, and must part with it, and distributes the same further, and that is milk, this milk is an animal substance, transmuted from the vegetable. In this milk is made another separation by fire, which must be kept gently. For the subtilliest Spirit of the milk together with the Sulphur sublimes, is taken off, and turned into a coagulated fatness, which is butter. The rest is separated by other means, and precipitated, and thereby is made another separation, this is a second coagulat-ion, out of which men make their food: Of the overplus, is made another separation by fire, not so fat as the former two: At last there remains an aquosity, and is of no great usefulness, because 291."},{"pageNumber":319,"pageContent":"the Spirit and its nutriment is taken from it \"by the several sep-arations. After this nature makes to a further putrifaction another and gross excretion of a Sulphureous and Salt substance, which gen-erates afresh a living Spirit, which is the excrement, this serves for the earth to \"be manured withall, making the earth fertil by its Sulphur and Salt, as being of a gross and fat substance whereby new fruits are produced, here is another nutriture from an animal into a vegetable. This makes wheat, and other fruits, and grains to grow, producing again a nutriment from the vegetables unto animals. Thus one nature doth follow after the other, by vulgar not so much comprehended, or searched into, not caring to learn natures qualities so much, which makes such natural things seem to be in-creadible. To return again to the structure of Man, the noblest Spirit of life has its dominion and seat for the'most part, and most strongly in the heart of mans body, as in the noblest part: And the Sulphur of man gives unto that Spirit a nutriment, and spiritual access for its preservation by the air. For if air be taken away from man, then .the Spirit of life is choaked up, departs invisibly, and death is at hand. The noblest Salt Spirit is a conserver of both, its noblest Spirit penetrates throughout, the grossest matter of its Salt is cast into the bladdar, and that has a Spirit of a special operation. That which goes from the Salt through the bladdar, is wrought upon by a heat, ministrates a new access; or increase, so that this in-crease of Salt in man is inexaustible, unless it die quite, and the body be burned to ashes, and the remainder be extracted. As for example; take the Salts from Minerals, let these grow again, coagulate, and extract the Salt again by water, the like is seen in nitrous earths also, and other common Salts, and there needs not quote any further examples.

If the heart grows faint, then is it a sign that the Vital Spirit is not nourished, upon which there ensue speedily deadly diseases; because that fire is not at liberty, and falls into an extinction, or choaking. The fire in the heart, and the natural heat is preserved, and supported by the air, of that air the lungs stand most in need of: The liver also must have air, else it cannot laugh: The spleen must have air, else it will be oppressed, with stichings and great pains; The true seat for the most part of the air is necessary for the lungs, if these fall into any weakness, the cause thereof is, because the Salt does not show its true, and meet help, and must go into rottenness, casting up blood and matter: Then there is at hand a corruption of the air, from which the Vital Spirit cannot find any true nourishment, but must be starved, because the Salt does not effect its conserving quality, the Sulphur, and the increase of the nourishment is obstructed, and is not perfect, whereby are caused consumptions, witherings of the body, consuming of the flesh, and exiccation of the blood, and of the marrow. The substance of Salt, or the Salt Spirit, which preserves the body, has its seat for the most part in the bladder, where all humidities have their issue, the remaining gross Salt is separated, and excerned by urine, as you heard already. I repeat it here again for that end, because the most noble Spirit, which does preserve man, does copulate, and make friendship with the Vital Spirit and its nutriment, which is Sulphur, and so they make the body perfect, and if any informity be incident, either from the"},{"pageNumber":321,"pageContent":"operation,or defective quality of the Stars, or from a disorderly life in eating and drinking, and many other inconveniences, and any corruption \"be present, then nature is not in her perfect con-dition. Here the knowing doctors must enquire into the cause, from which of these three the symptom does arise, and cure the same with convenient remedies, and not with any contrary medicines: As heat must be cured with heat, cold with cold, prickling with prickling. For one heat draws the other, one cold draws another, even as iron is drawn by a magnet; and so prickling simples may cure stiching diseases, and poisonous Minerals can heal, and bring to right poisonous symptoms,if they be duly and well prepared. And although sometimes externally a cooler be supplied, however I speak as a Philosopher, and one that is experienced in nature, that like must he cured and expelled fundamentally with the like, otherwise true medicaments are not applied, and the physicians deal not really in their profession. He that is not fundamentally learned herein, or does not observe these things, he is not a true physician, neither can he really say that he has learned any truth in Physic, because he is not able to discern cold and heat, dry and wet, for knowledge and experience, and a fundamental inquiry into natures mysteries make a good physician next the knowledge of the Creator, from whom all and every wisdom does descend, and is the Author of the beginning, middle, and end thereof. Next the invocation of the Creator, there follows natural means and medicaments, as they are found in themselves in their highest degree: I make no further mention here of other animals: Metals and Minerals follow next, for in Gold, Silver, and other metals, even to the seventh and last planet, are hid excellent things, Mercury being predominant in all, in some more than in others, and Minerals also are not without their virtuous medicines, and the former seven planets were in their \"beginning only Minerals. The tincture of SOL together with the potable Gold and Silver are of great efficacy, Mercury rules MICROCOSME; that, which is 294."},{"pageNumber":322,"pageContent":"found in the \"best metals, and most precious stones may be drawn also, if need \"be from Minerals.

The Creator had ordained all these out of a nought, because man should not gaze only upon earthly matters, but consider heavenly ones also and ought to know things supernatural, that faith may over-top the rest, and here the perogative in things seen and felt, and be preserved therein. If physicians do not understand these things, they ought not to be held for physicians, for the knowledge of God and Nature make a Physician as I told of it formerly, and not great prating without true knowledge, good writings of expert men may conduce somewhat hereunto. In brief, humane reason in physicians is not able to comprehend sufficiently, much less are they able to decide, fathom, and fully learn, what manner of medicaments there may be made of the MICRO-COSME, for he contains a perfect medicine for all diseases, like with like must be expelled and cured. MERCURY of the MICROCOSME is a living, incomprehensible, and volatile Spirit, as I have told. Mans Balsom dries up a Dropsie, and the clarified Salt of it cures consumptions; in Epileptic fits it does excellent well, and being prepared into a fragrant Spirit, all corrosiveness being taken from it, is nothing inferior unto AURUM POTABLE, to preserve mans health; it is very excellent for curing Leprosie: Passing by such diseases, which are of a lower nature and degree, it"},{"pageNumber":323,"pageContent":"\"breaks the stone in the bladder, and cures all Salt Rheums, if the artist prepares it well, and knows how to make use of it afterward. Thus I close with the MICROCOSME, contained in few lines, much . more could be spoken of this matter, or form, mobility and imag-ination, how they were brought unto perfection. For if these stand together in a true middle, will make up a sweet harmony, for without the matter, or form of the body, without the moving of the powers, and defect of perfect thoughts ORPHEUS will not please the DOLPHIN with any harmoneous melody: As it is with man, so it is with Metals: Mercury is the MOBILE in Gold, if the body be anatomized: Sulphur is hot, being driven from a Mineral and fixed, dries the phlegmatic LUNA, warms her, makes her Soul equal unto himself. In the matter and form there lies a Salt, which affords the coagulation of the body: The remainder in the Gold put away, for separation will afford a further revealation. Vegetables also show the form of their three principles, the visible matter contains the vegetable Salt, which is its conser-vative, the fragrancy of the vegetable is the Balsom, which min-isters a nourishment unto its perfect growth, the odour, or smell of any herb is of a volatile quality, and spiritual, and the Spirit for the most part shows itself in the fragrancy, and penetrates the Balsom, and its odour, be it pleasant, or not, is the essence, whereby men in their senses learn the condition and properties of vegetables. For other things I have written, I praise the Lord, which dwells on high. Thus closing I wish to every one the grace and blessing of God the Creator of all creatures, that they may be blessed, wise, and rich, both in this temporal and corruptible world, and in the other world attain to an eternal bliss.

And that I may rightly inform my fellow Christian, I must needs acknowledge and confess, that there are tow medicines, which heal all diseases and symptoms, be they whatsoever, and are made of one, the one is called PHALAIA, and is for inward use, the other is called ASA, is for external cures; both may be called to be only one, they differ only in their preparations; how both must be brought to their operative quality, the way unto it is showed in my MANUALS, for they must first be rightly known, and their nature must be searched into. Their matter is one, which by that expression I purposely hold it forth, lest it should be made too common. I after the manner of Ancient Philosophers before me, hiding secrets under dark sentences, hoping by the prayers of others to have their Souls saved, and received into that Garden, in which our first Parents were Created. Note, both Medicines are made of one matter, as I have already informed you. If used inwardly, it takes away all manner of infirmities: The matter is putrified, separated, and in a spagyric way purged in the best manner, and brought to a medicine of the highest degree, by fixing its own nature, which must be^brought to pass in the 297."},{"pageNumber":325,"pageContent":"fire. Its former poisonous volatile quality must be, rectified, by being prepared to an everlasting fixedness, which expells, purges, and rectifies all malignant Spirits, that a good nature may live quietly in a pure habitation. For this prepared Medicine, keeps that course, whereever it needs with any malignity, it will be revenged on it, and strives to expell it, and will solely keep possession there: For she cannot endure any contrary things about her, which are defiled with the least impurity. PHALAIA is the Universal Medicine to be used inwardly, and ASA is the Universal remedy for outward uses; it purifies mans blood, takes away all impurity, strengthens the brain, heart, stomach, and all other parts, causes good blood, strengthens the memory, repairs the defects, which are befallen the three principles, restores all lost things: It is the very key, whereby the body is opened: For it chases away leprosie, consumptions, gout, dropsy and all other diseases generally: For no sinful creature is fallen so totally, but she may have a comfort unto salvation in a Spirit-ual way, and a medicine unto health, appointed thereunto by the Creator, which is had if Nature be Anatomized by an expert Artist, to be prepared for that use. Here I speak of such diseases, which by some are called incure-able: For ordinary diseases there are ordinary means, which here are not mentioned, the uses of them are mentioned in a special treatise. But of my PHALAIA I say this much, according to my long exper-ience, that nothing can conceal or hide itself from her, being a penetrating searcher into all infirmities, she penetrates the body spiritually like a fume, penetrates the Arteries, muscles, and all the parts of the body like a Balsom, restores strength which was left by her Salt Spirit. Further, I cannot speak in the praising of my PHALAIA, she being a praise to such that make use of her. He that gets this PHALAIA rightly, to him is she sufficient for to cure all diseases. No tongue is able to ex-press and set forth fully her virtues. 298."},{"pageNumber":326,"pageContent":"As diseases do differ, which are incident unto the body, so there are means for their cure: But this medicine cures all dis-eases in general, being of an heavenly sideral quality, descended from the Elements, and generated by the three principles, coming . from the very heart of its Center of the whole circumference of the Globe performs all, affording to the MICROCOSME a perfect medicine found so really, according as the name imparts her virtues, but if rightly made and prepared, the use of it will prove it sufficiently. ASA is found in the operation, for external symptoms, as old ulcers, fistulas, cancers, which made many Shirurgions doubt whether ever they may be cured, but this ASA has made the cure: It consumes all bad blood, which was fallen into corruption, and may be inwardly used, because it will then exiccate, and dry up the fountains, from whence springs all manner of sores, fistulaes, cancers, wolves, NOLI ME TANGERE, running legs, worms, and the like, be it on what part of the body, where plasters, poultesses, and the like cannot help, and are not strong enough, this alone will do it. For fresh wounds, be they made by stabbing, cuting, slashing, it needs not to be administered, being too strong for such wounds, gentler means are fitter for them, Balsoms, Oils, Plasters, may heal them, either outwardly, or inwardly; powders and potions may be prepared. Symptoms in wounds, having their causes from within, must be cured by searching into them, and the means for their cure must be prepared of that strength, that they may reach home. As in this matter, things must be united, and be taken from the generation of ABIHAIL, being joined in their principles of the first essence, by natures means, is brought to the highest perfection, whereby such sores, ulcers, etc., are fundamentally cured. For ordinary wounds there is no need of it, if no symptoms are at hand, and the party endangered, a Balsom only will perform the deed, mollifying the flesh, and Nature will further, and promote the cure. Be thankful next God to me, that has taught you inward and outward 299."},{"pageNumber":327,"pageContent":"Medicines, and are such, which others \"before me have concealed, they can cure fundamentally any symptoms, \"be they within, or with-out on the body, such virtues are not found in out-landish woods, drugs, or herbs: Forraingners have their proper climates, under . which they have convenient Physical Vegetables: Our climate affords unto us proper Medicinal Vegetables, Animals, and Minerals for our constitution; only doctors are not expert to amke their Med-icinal preparation out of them. I hold with my Physick PHALAIA and ASA of one name in their descent, whereby Nature has made me to be a Physician; it keeps good to the last, preserves man in health and strength all the time the Creator has appointed for him: Virtue it has showed triumphantly in many parties, obtaining victory against all its enemies, and it was apparent to the world, that these two Medicines PHALAIA and ASA of one kind, and of one matter made and prepared: And is found daily, that in the gener-ality they can set all into a perfect degree, as being descended from the Center, can preserve the Center as the Root, and can bring things to right within and without, tending to that end, for which it is prepared. Thus I wish the reader, to whom I faithfully intimated the Manuals of it, prosperity and success in the preparation of it, that it may be unto his health: The work will praise the Master, upon my Oath I further inform you this, that four things are re-quired to make a perfect Philosopher, and physician. First he must be importunate and fervent in his devotion to God, as the highest heavenly Physician, to ask of him grace, wisdom, understanding, and his blessing upon his undertakings, that it may appear unto the world, that God grants things for the good of men, that he may be praised and magnified for such bene-fits: And is to show himself in his life and conversation godly and honest. Secondly, a Physician ought to know the diseases, and to dis-tinguish the one from the other, and what proper remedies he is \"to use against these diseases: For without the knowledge of dis eases a physician is not perfect: Mans complexion must be discerned, 300."},{"pageNumber":328,"pageContent":"the cause of the disease searched into, and the means well con-sidered, that no contraries \"be applied, whereby further troubles are caused: Proper remedies fitting the diseases must be applied, that restitution be made unto former health. Thirdly, it is requisite, that he read frequently the writings of Ancient Philosophers, and read them over and over, and take notice in what they do concur and agree; and where they aim all at one mark, then he that has understanding will discern the good from the bad, sophistry from truth: The Ancients knew many good things, for mine own part I must confess, that I borrowed the foundation of my knowledge from them, which made me to lay it to heart, and am thereby moved to leave for others also a Corner-stone , that truth may further be confirmed, and grounds of it made easier, clearer, plainer, and more manifest by a further knowledge of my writing. Fourthly, a Philosopher must learn to Anatomize things in Nature, •to know what they contain within and without, to separate the poison from the Medicinal quality. Here unto belong several Man-uals, how to dissolve, separate, exalt; and prepare fully Metals, Minerals, Vegetables, and Animals. He that has learned all these, he may discourse wisely of things, confirm their grounds in truth; but others, which are ashamed to work herein, cannot glory in any truth; because by the receipts found in other mens writings, not endeavouring to learn more in their own experience; I am not ashamed to learn daily, because Nature is round and endless, cannot be comprehended fully, by reason of the shortness of mens life, and none can say that there is nothing left more for him to learn. No such matter. Thus you see, that Gods blessing must be obtained by fervent and frequent prating unto God, the causes of diseases must be known, their cure must be ordered according to the direction of Philosophic writings, adjoining an experimental knowledge there-unto. He that does, and knows these four things may glory in his ways, confirming things in deeds, and not to exercise a trade upon other mens receipts. 301."},{"pageNumber":329,"pageContent":"My Medicaments, if well prepared and duly used, will by Gods halp make known, that they received their strength from God, the Marvellous Creator to perform these things, which ignorants, and men of little faith cannot comprehend: By daily experience faith . gets strength, that man may praise the highest, who has put such virtues into natural things, for the which mortals are not able to return sufficient thanks. As much as lies in my power I will praise the Lord day and night, and is not possible to require him in any other way. At the closing observe thus much: In school long discourses are made of the three principles of all things, of the matter of heaven, what it is made of, and on what the earth does rest, how the Elements were made, and of the beginning of the firmament, and of several opinions they are about the original causes of Metals, Minerals, Vegetables, of their qualities and properties, of the original of man, and of other Animals, search-ing in their conceits into their lives, virtues, etc. But my Son hearken unto me, and take notice of what I say; all their pretended sayings are a meer nothing, they speak ignorantly with-out any certainty; because they have no experimental knowledge, having laid no foundation, nor have they learned any true decision in their demonstrations: Thoughts pay no Custom, or Toll, they fly into heaven, descend to the nethermost parts of the earth, if experience and their thought do not concur, then their thoughts are found a meer opinion, then they must confess, I did not think it could be so! Mans thoughts are fitly compared with a dream, because nothing follows upon an imagination: Natures Secrets must be studied experimentally. If Artists or Mechanics would imagine to work such, or such things, be it Watches, or other curious Metalline works, but does not invent fit instruments, whereby to make that work they have in their fancy, what can they produce by that imagination? An empty opinion, and no Art. So in the knowledge of Natural things, their Secrets require a greater exact-ness to be searched into, which to lazy unexpert men seem strange and impossible. I tell you there is required an exact diligence to find that, which lies hid in them,' it must be done by separation."},{"pageNumber":330,"pageContent":"Nature must be anatomized, good and bad in it must be discerned, what is contained in each in its Center, for the general, and what comes from it in particular. Therefore the MACROCOSME and MICROSOSME, yea, the things which . grow and are found therein, are compared to a round Circle, in whose middle there is a Center, let the Circle be turned which way it will, it keeps round every way, and its Center stays un-removed. A Philosopher must know rightly the Center of each mat-ter, which must stand unremoved in every substance, but the sub-stance may be turned any way he pleases, and make of it several forms, according as it received its power from above. I speak now to be taken notice of thus: I take in hand any natural thing, dissolve, or open it by a key, which is the means of the unfolding, and search therein by a fire's proof, which is the master of all proofs, what may be made of it: Here I find as many wonders and qualities, which I never thought of, much less had I experience of. Of natural things are made Powders, Oils, Water, Salt, Volatile Spirits, and Fumes: In these preparations are beheld wonders upon wonders, witness the distillations, digestions, and putrifact-ions. There are found and seen many Spiritual and .Corporeal colours, which appear black, grey, white, blue, green, yellow, red, azure colour, with a reflexion of all manner of insprinkled colours, which cannot well be described, and unexpert men hardly believe it. From these preparations are several qualities felt, the one is corrosive and sharp, the other is pleasant and mild, the one is sour, the other is sweet, according as they are pre-pared, so they yield good or bad, poison or physic: For a good thing can be made the worst poison, and the worst poison can be turned into the best medicine: Which is not so great a marvel, because all lies in the preparation of things: Though every one cannot conceive of it, yet it is so, and will be a truth forever, because Nature has manifested herself thus by experience. A blind man cannot tell how the inward parts of mans body are 303."},{"pageNumber":331,"pageContent":"conditioned, \"but the seeing physician, who anatomizes the \"body, he can judge of the situation of the Heart, Brain, Liver, Reins, Bladder, of the Entrals, and of all the Veins, and knows in what form and condition they are. But before he has made this ana-tomy, all these were hid from him, a miner which seeks for ores, he does not know what riches he may expect from Metals, unless he opens the ore, and so fine it: What he finds in it by fire, then he may know really in his calculation, what riches he may expect from it. So other things must be proceeded in, which true Naturalists will endeavour to do, and not prate of things only without experimental knowledge, disputing of colours with the blind man, learn to know the ground with your own eyes and hands, which Nature hides within her, then you may speak wisely of them with good reason, and you may build upon an invincible Rock. If you do not so, then you are but a phantastic prater, whose discourse is grounded on sand- without experience, and is soon shaken by every wind, and ruined in the end. The ground of this knowledge must be learned as you heard, by anatomizing and separating of things, which by distillation is made known: Where every Element is separated apart, there It will be made known what is cold, or moist, warm, or day. There you learn to know the three principles, how the Spirit is separated from the body, and how the Oil is separated from the water, and how the Salt is drawn from the CAPUT MORT of each matter, and is reduced again into a Spirit, and how these are afterward in a conjunction may profitably and safely be used for their several uses they are prepared for: All which must be done by a MEDIUM. At the first Creation man is earthly and gross, but his Soul, Spirit, and Body, being separated by death, putrifies underground, and when the highest comes to judgement, he is raised again, his body, Soul, and Spirit comes together, according to faith and Scripture; that body is no more earthly, as it was formerly, but is found heavenly and clarified, glittering as the Stars in the East, and like the Sun is seen, when all the clouds are past. So it is here, when earthlyness is 30^."},{"pageNumber":332,"pageContent":"\"broken, divided, and separated, then the three principles of the dead substance are made apparent, the dead one is forsaken, the living power comes to her perfection, because her obstruction is laid aside, that the virtue in the operation may \"be manifested; in this separation and manifestation is then known what these three principles are, which are so much discoursed of, namely Mercury, Sulphur, and Salt, according to the condition of the Subject. He that does not think it to be true, let him go to the end of the World, where he shall feel all, what in his dumb capacity he could not comprehend: If any one should intend to teach me any other with a prolixity of words, he may fill me with words, but he must prove it really also, for without that I am not bound to believe his words, but desire some sign, as THOMAS one of the Twelve, who looked for an Ocular demonstration: I might have left out THOMAS, but being there is a GULF between a Spiritual and worldly unbeliever, I gave liberty to my mind to speak it, for there is a great difference in heavenly and worldly matters, touching faith and things comprehensible, and there is that differ-ence found also in Sideral and earthly things: For Sideral things are comprehended by sharp imagination, and Arithmetic rules, but to the finding out of earthly things there belongs Speculation and Separation: With Speculation must be joined an intention, and an apprehension is annexed to Speculation, the former is done Spiritually, because the Spirit of man does not rest, desires to apprehend more qualities of the Spirit in things natural: Every Spirit still draws its like: The rest is earthly: For an earthly body separates by manuals the earthly body from the Spiritual part. And so the one may be discerned before and from the other. Whereas the Soul in both shows herself really, therefore is she in all really, for she ties the heavenly and earthly together like a bond, but when the heavenly is separated from the earthly, that the Soul also must forsake her body, then you have separated and received the three as apart, which after a true knowledge and conjunction can afford such a triumping and clarified body which"},{"pageNumber":333,"pageContent":"is found, in a better degree of many thousand times because the grossest is laid aside from the earthy. For when heaven and earth come to be refined by the great Creator, then the greatest part will be consumed by fire, and by that pur-ging it will be exalted to the same degree with the heavenly, and set into the same line, for each all is created by one, each all is ordained by one, and through sin by one man all was corrupted unto death, yet all is by one brought to a better state of life: And the only Creator intends to judge all by fire, and all must again become one, which will be that heavenly essence, to which the earthly gave way by means of the fire: The eternal glory leaving a room for devil and death, from whence they shall look on the elect, admiring the great majesty and glory of God, which in a divine essence of three distinct persons is all in all. And has created all. Thus the three persons in the deity have held forth in us three invisible essences, giving thereby to understand by an unsearch-able wisdom, what their creature and order is: We men are too weak to come higher; God is and will be God, and we men must be content with such gifts afforded unto us: Hereafter shall be accomplished that which is prophesied of by the Prophets and Apostles, and now are conceived of only by way of faith, therefore we ought now to be converted, what by Nature is intimated in a visible way: Other things incomprehensible unto us, and matters of faith, will appear better to be understood at the end of the world; God grant unto us all a true knowledge of temporal goods and of the eternal. At the closing of this I say, that this is the whole Art and whole foundation of all the Philosophic speech in which is that sought, which many desire, taking great pains, and making great expenses, namely to get wisdom and judgement, a long health and riches of this world comprehended in a few words; as for example, first you must know, that I will show unto you such an example, of the Animals, which in the appearance is a mean and poor one,"},{"pageNumber":334,"pageContent":"are increased, and in their kind preserved: But the first beginn-ing of a vegetable Seed is a Spiritual essence or astral influ-ence, whereby in the earth was gotten an imagination, and became impregnated with a matter, out of which by the help of the Elements it came to be something: What form of Seed the earth was desirous of after the heavenly impression, that form it received first, and brought it to a kind, which brings a further increase by its palpable Seed in the generation, hereby man may try his further skill; but he is not able to create a new Seed, as Nature does by an influence from above, only he is able to encrease a formed Seed. Of Metals and Minerals I inform you this, that there is one only Almighty Being, which is from eternity, and abides unto eternity, which is the Creator of heaven and earth, nemely the eternal Diety in three distinct persons, which three in the Diety are a perfect divine being: And though I confess and acknowledge these three persons, yet I confess only one God in one Being. This I do now speak as a Type of the first Seed of the three principles; that the first beginning, to beget Metalline Seeds is wrought in the earth by a sideral impression, which quality presses from above into the nether as in the belly of the earth, and works continually a heat therein, with the help of the Elements; for both must be together: The earthly affords an imagination, that the earth is fitted for conception and impregnation, the Elements nourishes and feeds this fruit, bring it on by a continued hot quality into perfection, the earthly substance affords a form thereunto, thus at the beginning the Metalline and Mineral Seed is effected namely by an astral imagination, elemental operation, and terrestrial form: The astral is heavenly, the elementary is spiritual, and the earthly is corporeal, these three make of their first Center the first essence of the Metalline Seed,\" which Philo-sophers have further searched into, that out of this essence these is become a form of a Metalline matter, palpably joined together of three, of a Metalline Sulphur heavenly,' a Metalline Mercury spiritual, and a Metalline Salt bodily, which three are found at"},{"pageNumber":335,"pageContent":"\"but of a mighty consequence, if rightly considered. The hen layed the egg, the same egg is brought by heat to a hardness or coag-ulation; by a further heat it is brought to a putrefaction, where it is corrupted: In this putrefaction the egg receives a new GENUS, wherein is raised a new life, and a Chicken is hatched, this Chicken being perfect, the shell opens making way for the Chicken to creep forth, this Chicken coming to a further ripe-ness and age, increases further in her kind. Thus Nature furthers her own kind, and augments USQUE AD INFIN-ITUM. True, the egg is not PRIMA MATERIA of the Cock or Hen; but the PRIMA MATERIA of their flesh is the first Seed, out of which the egg is gone into a form, which by the equal nature of the motion of both is driven together and united, from thence by a further heat it went to a putrefaction, from thence into a new birth, which new birth still propagates and increases. So it is with man, for one man alone cannot produce a new birth, unless both Seeds of Male and Female be united, for after this conjunction through Nutriment of the body, and continued natural heat of these two Seeds, which in the Center are known for one Nature, get a new life, and more men are begotten, which propagate further by their Seed, by this means the whole world is filled with men. This Seed of Man is the noblest subtilest blood of a white quality, in which dwells the vital Spirit, which is driven together by motion. If these Seeds of both kinds by their desire of lust are together united, and their Natures be not corrupted, or else are contrary one to another, then there is preserved a life by a heat, and brought to perfection in the mothers womb, and another man is brought forth, thus much be spoken of the Seed of Animals. The Vegetable Seed is made palpable and visible which from each kind of herb is separated and propagated in the earth for an in-crease, which Seed must first putrifie in the earth, and then must be nourished by a temperate moisture, at last this Seed by a convenient warm air is brought to a perfection, thus Vegetables"},{"pageNumber":336,"pageContent":"the opening of Metals: For Metals and Minerals must be broken and opened: Minerals are of the same sanguinity, of the same qual-ity and nature, as Metals are, only they are not sufficiently ripened unto coagulation, and may be acknowledged for unripe Metals, for the Spirit in them is found as mighity Metalline as it is in the perfect Metals. For Metals may be destroyed and easily reduced unto Minerals, and of Minerals are prepared Med-icaments, which ripen and transmute Metals, which must be noted: And it is done, when Spirit, Soul, and Body are separated and purely re-united. The remaining terrestrity being put off, then follows a perfect birth, and the perfect ripening by heat performs her office, that Spirit, Soul, and Body at the beginning in their first Seed have been a heavenly water, which begot these three, out of which three is become a Metalline Sulphur, a Metalline Mercury, and a Metalline Salt, these in their conjunction made a fix, visible, palpable body; first begun a Mineral one, then a Metalline by an astral imagination, digested and ripened by the Elements, and an earthly substance are made formal and material. Now when these bodies of Minerals and Metals are reduced to their first beginning, then the heavenly Seed does appear and is Spirit-ual, which Spiritual must become an earthly one by the copulation of the Soul, which is the MEDIUM and middle bond of their union to make a Medicine out of it, whereby is obtained health, long life, wisdom, riches in this mortal life: This is the true Sperm of Philosophers, long sought after, but not known: Whose light was desired of many to be seen, and is even the first matter, which lies open before the eyes of all the world, few men know, it is found visibly in all places, namely Mercury, Sulphur, and Salt, and a Mineral water or Metalline liquor, as the Center, separated from its form, and made by these three principles.

And moreover, that you might not want those Noble Medicines, in case you should want either skill, or time, and leasure to prepare them. I am resolved with the assistance of Almighty God, to prepare always some of the Magistery of Anti-mony of our Philosopher, which he teaches you to make out of Mer-cury and Antimony, and has been found by me and many others a most excellent Medicine in many desperate distempers, and do intend to leave it with the Stationer Master, Edward Brewster, at the Crane in Pauls Church-yard, that has been of the charges of the printing of this book; so that you may have it there, when-soever you have occasion for it, and at so reasonable a price,as you yourself will hardly be able to prepare it at a cheaper rate. But you are to know, that I have exalted this Medicine, and pre-pared it much better than our Philosopher, because I have fer-mented the same with a Volatile essence of Gold, and then fixed them together, so that I do account this Magisterium ANTIMONIO SOLARE may deservedly be esteemed a Panacaea. But because the Stone does require a medicine of another nature, I have added our Philosophers Medicine against the Stone, which you may have like-wise at the aforesaid Stationer-shop.

And thus I hope these three Medicines will serve you, if not absolutely for all distempers, yet for the greatest part of them, as well in CHYRURGIA as MEDICINA; and you will not be necessitated to follow and to make use of a great many uncertain Remedies and Recipes."},{"pageNumber":341,"pageContent":"In the name of the Eternal Trinity, God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Ghost, I BASIL VALENTINE do here set down those Manual Operations, whereby I have prepared my following Medicines, which by Gods assistance have made me a successful and scarce ever failing Physician. But before I set forth those Medicines, I must here remember, as many authors have done before me, which I well approve of: That the Ancient searchers of Nature, who have lived long ago much before me, have written of a bird, named by them PHOENIX, and is still at this very time called so. Not that such a Bird is really existent, or to be found in the whole world, that flies from one place to another, looking after her meat and breeding her young; for indeed there is no such thing. But the PHOENIX is a fictitious Bird, which is never consumed in the fire, but renews her age therein, and her kind is raised by the fire, so that she lasts to the end of the world. Thus likewise it is to be under-stood of Medicines, which must cure, and by rooting out consume fixed diseases, that they must be prepared so as to be fixed, before they can dispell fixed things. For nothing that is slight, or feeble, can resist that which is strong, but the strong must be cast out by stronger. Therefore the Ancients have invented this Bird, and compared her with our true Stone, being the Uni-versal Medicine of the world. Besides this Universal Medicine, there are prepared many other Medicines, which indeed do not consume diseases universally, as our Stone does, but do work particularly every one, curing certain diseases, whereto they are ordained by the most High from the beginning at the Creation for the good of Mankind, which are to be further prepared and perfected by the Physician. For hot dis-tempers require their own Physic; cold distempers, having their original from cold, do likewise require a proper remedy. The like do mixed distempers, which are of a middle nature. All this must the skillful physician know and understand, if so be he intends to gain credit by his Art: On the contrary, without such knowledge, 31^."},{"pageNumber":342,"pageContent":"he will not in all his lifetime gain any esteem, hut loose his credit and reputation. For every physician must consider, that there is a great difference \"betwixt those diseases, which have fully possessed, and clearly overspread the whole \"body, as the Leprosie, and such like; and those distempers which have \"but taken up their lodging in a mans body, as a traveller does his at an Inn; such are the several sorts of fevers, and other like maladies. Therefore every single medicine must be directed and applied to the disease, to which it is proper and deputed. In like manner, external distempers have their peculiar natures, and a certain difference must be made betwixt them. For in old, lasting, and spreading ulcers and sores, which arise from within, another way of cure must be used, then in healing of simple, common, green wounds, outwardly made upon the flesh, which may be well cured only by outward application of certain Ointments, piasters, Sal-ves, Herbs, Balsoms, and Oils: And (except some singular accidents by the influence of the Stars of Heaven, should require the pre-paration of some healing Drinks to be inwardly taken) those afore-said Medicines may be sufficient alone to cure any green wounds, without further addition of any other inward means. But this cannot be in old ulcers, which have their original from within. For their original being internal, there must be internal Physic likewise administered, whereby those humors, which keep them open, may be dried up. And their issuing forth stopped. But may some physicians say; how can we remember all this? This would cost too much labour, and much time will be spent in finding it out, and our life is too short, death will prevent us herein. A Phy-sician ought indeed to know it, if so be he will be perfect, and discharge his office and calling before God and the world con-scientiously , that the account of his Stewardship may not find him in Hell.

But when the ignor-ant fellow by further enquiry is required to give an account of • the original of all such colours, how those colours arise, and how they are driven out by Nature; he is then as learned a Master as Doctor COXCOMBE, who was to taste some broth, whether it was salted sufficiently. Therefore something more is required to learn to know every thing, and to search into hidden Secrets. For a searcher of Nature must know more than a silly country-man, who only beholds the colours, which every one may do, since they are exposed to everyones view, but he must look back, and by serious speculations search and enquire, how those many colours visibly shining in Animals and Vegetables, are likewise set forth and do appear in Metals. If he finds and discerns this, he is then a true searcher of Nature indeed: But without it, he is no more such a one, than other un-experienced country-men. I will speak no more of this, but hereafter I must tell you, that all Natural diseases, external and internal are caused by two things, to wit, either by an earthly and grosser medium, as by inordinate or superfluous eating and drinking, or too much care, fear, watching, taking colds, and the like; or else by more spiritual and heavenly influences, as when Elements b&come infected, polluted and poisoned, whereby they produce many and manifold distempers in the lesser world. The first is more corporeal, the other spiritual, for it is produced after a kind of spiritual manner. The bodily distempers have their seat in the blood and stomach, from whence they work into the other parts, and cause pain: Such distempers may he cured well enough by more earthly and gross ways, as by purging and letting of blood. But as concerning spiritual diseases, wrought by mal-ignant influences of the Stars, they are not removed by corporeal and bodily remedies, for they are much too weak : But it is to be observed, that if such a spiritual distemper have taken deep 316."},{"pageNumber":344,"pageContent":"root, spiritual Medicines are to be applied, which are of that nature, that though they do look like corporeal ones, yet are they so prepared, that like a volatile spirit they penetrate the whole body, to sweep away all morbific matter, which no Medicine . is able to perform, which not being separated from, lies as yet hidden in its gross body. What other distempers soever there be, that do not derive their original from these two natural causes above said, they are not Accidents of Nature, neither can they be accounted natural, but must be judged to have been wrought by Witchcraft, which cannot be cured as other distempers, and with such remedies; but if any desires to be freed of them, a Magical cure must be used, nevertheless such Magick must be followed, as is not against Nature, but rather does agree with it, and which does not dishonour our Saviour, nor endanger our Souls, but works in a way suiting to Nature. There might be much said, and much written of these things, but I hold it needless for some pregnant reasons, which I do keep to myself. For herein neither the wit of ATHENS can assist me, nor the power of the ROMANS; neither can the riches of CRAESUS or ABASUERUS pay me for what I keep back in those points of Magick, which I hope is prudently done of me.

The universal shall follow hereafter. OF VITRIOL AND ITS PREPARATION, AS ALSO ITS POWER AND VIRTUES. Take good Hungarian Vitriol, calcine it, till it be of a yellow-ish colour, and no higher. Grind this calcined Vitriol small, put it into a distilling vessel of glass, with a long neck, well luted, LUTO SAPIENTIE. Put thereto a large receiver, and begin to distill day and night with a very gentle fire, that gives not a stronger heat, than the Sun does on a hot day. Afterwards increase the fire by degrees, forcing at last the Spirits with the strongest fire, till red visible drops do come over, which work has taken up three days and nights. This being done, take that which is left in the distilling vessel, commonly called CAPUT MORTUUM, and grind it small; pour on it clear rain-water first distilled, and boil therein the CHOLCOTAR, and the Salt of the Vitriol will go into the water. The water being settled and clear, filter it, that the faces may be separated. Let the water vapour away gently in some glass vessel, till the Salt be dry; dissolve the Salt again in rain-water first distilled and let it vapour away a£ain to dryness. Repeat this operation the third time, and the'Salt of Vitriol will be very fair, clean, and clear. Put this dry Salt into a CUCURBIT of glass, and pour on it the above made Spirit of Vitriol, lute the glass LUTE SAPIENTIE, and set it in digestion for some days. This being done, open the glass, and put the materials together into a Retort of glass, and distill them first gently, and when it ceases to drop, increase 318."},{"pageNumber":346,"pageContent":"the fire, and force it over, till nothing will come more. Let it \"become cold, and then take the Spirit out of the receiver, which must \"be somewhat large and strong. Put the Spirit into a glass-body, and rectifie it \"by distillation, till it \"be freed from the phlegm, and the matter in the glass-body appear to be of a red deep brown colouri Then take the glass-body, and set it with the said matter in a cellar, and there will shoot from it very fair, white, clear, transparent crystals. Put these trans-parent crystals into a large phiol, with a very large and long neck, and pour on them the first white Spirit of Terpentine, and it will boil up and foam, therefore you must be very careful, and not over-hasty in doing this. The crystals will dissolve, and the Spirit of Terpentine will grow transparent, as red as blood. This being done, pour on it three times the weight of common Spirit of wine in BALNEO MARIE, and the tincture of Vitriol comes, over very pleasant with the Spirit of wine, and that which is corrosive remains behind with the oily parts of the Spirit of Turpentine, the Spirit of wine being come with the tincture, put it together into another phiol, and pour on it some fresh Spirit of wine, and distill it again gently in BALNEO MARIE, as you did before; if any corrosive be come over with the fire, it will now stay behind. Repeat this operation the third time, and the work is done and perfect. Put this fair, red, transparent Spirit of Vitriol into a Pelican, add to it at once half an ounce of well pulverised unicorn-horn, and let it stand in circulation in a gentle heat for a whole month. Then pour it off very clear from the feces, and the tincture of Vitriol is prepared for the Med-icine, of a very pleasant taste, and is to be used after the manner following, to wit, let him that is troubled with the falling-sick-ness, take half a dram of it in a spoonful of LILLIUM CONVALLIUM WATER, when the fit is coming upon him, thus let him use it three times, and this Medicine will cure him by the help of God. He that is mad and distracted, should take it likewise in wine for the space of eight days, and he will have reason to give thanks to"},{"pageNumber":347,"pageContent":"God for it. Moreover, if it \"be taken in wine, it does resolve any hardness settled in the nerves; and if it be constantly used for some time, even the Gout itself is consumed and cured thereby. Likewise it makes those who are melancholy and troubled with sad-ness, if it be used as before, very cheerful and lighthearted, dispells all sadness, and breeds good pure blood. It has been found very excellent in swimmings and giddiness in the head, it comforts the brain, and preserves the memory. If it he administ-ered in consumptions of the lungs, and any other coughs, in the manner aforesaid, it will cure those distempers, and is very use-ful for many things. AN ADDITION Take Sal-armonic, dissolve a considerable quantity of it in the strongest Vinegar, and add to it filings of Copper, let it putrifie in heat, till the filings are all grown friable, so that they may be ground into powder, and you will have a yellow powder, which Edulcorate well. Having done so, dry the powder, and pour on it the red AQUA VITAE VITRIOLI, which has been distilled over with its proper Salt, so that it cover it all over; set it thus in heat, and the powder of the Copper will be dissolved in the Oil, but there must some fair water be mixed with it, then draw it off in sand to dryness, and the phlegm comes over: The remainder force out of a Retort in an open fire, and you will find an OLEUM VENERIS, green, transparent, like an Emerald.

The sweet essence of Vitriol, whereby many wonderful cures may be wrought, is only prepared out of its Sulphur, which burns like other brimstone. To obtain this, proceed after this manner. Take of the best Vitriol you can get; dissolve it in fair foun-tain-water; after this take pot-ashes, such as dyers use for their dying, those dissolve likewise in fair fountain-water, let it settle well, and then pour off the clear from the dregs, and add to it the solution of Vitriol, and one will inflame the other, and cause a separation. For the Sulphur of Vitriol does separate itself by precipitation. Make a considerable quantity of it, and edulcorate it from all impurity. Afterwards dry the same Sulphur, which will burn like other Sulphur, being cast upon glow-ing coals. Take now of this Sulphur, and sublime it by itself, without any addition, and there will remain some feces, which separate and put away. Then take the Sulphur, and grind together with it half its weight of common Salt of Tartar, and distill them together through a retort, and there will come over a reddish oil. Pour to this oil some distilled Vinegar, and there will precipitate a brown powder, and the Spirit of Tartar remains in the water. Edul-corate the same powder very well, for therein is the treasure to be looked after. This work being done pour some Spirit of wine on the said pow-der, and let it circulate in heat for eight days. Thus the ex-cellent sweet Essence of the Sulphur of Vitriol goes into the Spirit of wine, and swims upon the top in FORMA OLEI, like oil of cinnamon. Then separate the essence from the Spirit of wine, by means of a separating glass, and keep it very carefully for use, it being a great treasure."},{"pageNumber":349,"pageContent":"THE USE OF THIS MEDICINE This Essence of Sulphur, four grains of it being taken in Balm-water, drys up the bad humors of the blood, strengthens and incites Men and Woman to Copulation, cleans the womb, hinders the Rising of the Mother, and \"breeds good seed for the procreation of child-ren.

Note, this sweet Essence of Vitriol has that Eminent Physican Doctor HARTMAN taken out of this book, and inserted in his PRAXIS CHYMIATRICA, SUB TITULO LEPRA, where he does explain something of this process. THE PREPARATION OF THE STONE IGNIS. Now I will teach you the chiefest preparation of Antimony, and the use of it in Medicine. In this Antimony are hidden, and found so many wonderful mysteries, that there is none too old to learn, and to search to find them out. Therefore I will instruct you here to make only some preparations which also are required to other things. Take pure Mineral Antimony, which is brought from HUNGARY, grind it small, and wash it very clean, that the earth may be separated from it. Take then a pound of it, mix with it as much of fluxing powder made of Tartar and Niter, cover it with common Salt, and melt it down in a Crucible with a strong fire: when it is well"},{"pageNumber":350,"pageContent":"melted like water, let it cool; put again to it the like quantity of new fluxing powder and melt it once again, and then the REG-ULUS will \"be clear and pure, add to this REGULUS its weight of NITRE, and melt it down. Pour it out together, and \"beat off the • SCORIE, and put again to the REGULUS its weight of NITRE, and melt it. Repeat this till all the REGULUS is gone into SCORIE, which you must carefully keep; They will burn upon the tongue like fire. This being done, take the matter so gathered grind it small, and edulcorate the Salt-peter from it, and there remains a brown-yellow powder, which dry and keep, it looks like ground glass. Take now a common REGULUS of ANTIMONY, made with Salt-peter and Tartar, grind it small, and put it into a round glass, which must not be too high, and fasten a head to it. Sublime your REGULUS in sand by itself without any addition. Sweep the sublimate with a feather again into the glass, and sublime it again; repeat this so long, till nothing do rise, but remain red and fixed in the bottom, then take this fixed Antimony, and put it upon a stone in a cellar, and in time it will be dissolved into water, which dis-till in BALNEO MARIE, until the sixth part only of the water do remain in the glass. Set this in a cold place,and there will shoot reddish crystals', which dissolve in rain-water, filter it, and draw off the flegme to a thickness; set it by as before, and the crystals will shoot white and very pure, like unto Salt-peter: This is the Salt\" of Antimony. \"Take these crystals, and pour upon them pure distilled Vinegar, and they will dissolve in the Vine-gar. Then distill the Vinegar, the glass being very close luted, forcing at last the Spirits into the Vinegar, and then the Vinegar is prepared. Take this Vinegar, and pour it on the prepared brown-yellow powder, and set it in some warm place, and the Vinegar will draw out the tincture of Antimony altogether red within half a quarter of an hour. Pour off this extraction together, and set it to digest for eight and twenty days in BALNEO MARIE, after-wards distill from it the Vinegar through an Alembic in sand, forcing in the end the oil into another glass, which comes over"},{"pageNumber":351,"pageContent":"with many strange and wonderful veins. Rectifie this Oil in ashes and the rest of the Vinegar, if any be left, will come off, and the Oil remains very sweet, and of a pleasant red colour like a Ruby. Thus have you joined the Sulphur with the Salt of Antimony, and brought it over like an AQUA VITAE, which keep very carefully. Furthermore, take again a common REGULUS of Antimony, made with Salt-peter and Tartar, and beat it to powder. Then take of strong distilled Vinegar three measures, (alias, one measure) ID EST four quarts and a half. Put into it of Sal-armoniac: Of Salt of Tartar (wherewith I will teach you hereafter at the end of my directions where I intend to write of the Philosophers Stone, to prepare Spirit of wine) likewise eight ounces. Digest this to the evaporation of the Vinegar, and mingle with the Salts three parts of VENICE TRIPOLY, and distill the Spirit, which is of a singular nature and property. Pour this Spirit on the pulverised REGULUS of Antimony, and having the glass well luted, let it stand in digestion sixteen days; then distill the Spirit from the matter to a dryness, and grind four times the weight of filings of steel with the same, put it into a retort, and putting thereto a large receiver full of water, distill it forcing at last with a strong fire, and the Mercury comes over in fumes, and is quickened in the water, which is the true Mercury of Antimony. Take common Spirit of Vitriol, add a little common water to it, and put your filings of steel into it, let it stand till the fil-ings are dissolved, then pour it off clean, and put away the feces Afterwards distill the Spirit in ashes to a thickness, and set the glass in a cold place, and there will shoot good Vitriol of Iron, which take, and having first vapoured away the phlegm, min-gle with it three parts of the powder made of burned potshards of broken pots: Put it into a retort, draw off the phlegm first, then force the Spirit with a strong fire into a proper glass, which rectifie to the height, and there will remain an Oil in the bottom. Pour this Oil upon the Mercury made before, and draw"},{"pageNumber":352,"pageContent":"off the phlegm in hot ashes, and the tincture of the AQUA VITAE remains \"behind, and does precipitate the Mercury into a fair high coloured powder of very great virtues in curing old running sores. THE CONJUNCTION OF THE THREE PRINCIPLES, SULPHUR, SALT, AND MERCURY OF ANTIMONY. Take then of this precipitate well edulcorated with common Spirit of wine, one part; and pour on it of the above mentioned sweet oil, three parts, in a phiol, so that the phiol \"be not above half full. Then seal it Hermetically, and place it in a Philosophical furnace, and the precipitate will be dissolved in that continual heat. Open then the glass, and continue a strong fire, till the matter become a fixed powder, and do fix,and then the Stone IGNIS is prepared, of which I have written. This Stone is a peculiar Tincture in Mens bodies as well as in those of Metal. This may be used in many hard and dangerous distempers, as I have set down in the directions for the administration and use of the same in The Triumphant Chariot of Antimony. AN ADDITION Take of this Stone, or particular Tincture, half an ounce, cast it upon twelve ounces and a half of pure Silver, or upon as much pewter or lead, let it flow very well for four and twenty hours; then drive it off clean, and Quart it, as tryers and refiners do, and you will find in the Silver two ounces and a half of very good Gold, and in the Pewter or lead one ounce, upon the Cupel. 325."},{"pageNumber":353,"pageContent":"ANOTHER MEDICINE MADE OUT OF ANTIMONY AND MERCURY, AND OF ITS EFFECTS IN OUTWARD SORES . Take HUNGARIAN Antimony, and sublimed Mercury, and grind them . well together, and distill them through an earthen retort, forcing them at last with the strongest fire imaginable, and you will-obtain an Oil, which separate and keep apart. Put away the quick Mercury, if it be there be any, and the Cinnabre you will find in the neck of the retort. But as for the CAPUT MORTUUM, grind it small, and put it into a new retort, and having poured on it the Oil, first made warm, distill it again from it. Repeat this so often, till the CAPUT MORTUUM remain behind like ashes, and then your Oil is prepared. After this take so much fresh Anti-mony, as first of all the CAPUT MORTUUM did weigh, grind it small, and pour on it the Oil first warmed, and so many times distilled as before, till the Oil be come over as red as a Ruby, and the CAPUT MORTUUM likewise remain like ashes in the bottom of the glass, and then the Oil is prepared. THE PREPARATION OF THE SUBLIMATE FOR THIS WORK . Take one pound and a half of HUNGARIAN Vitriol, one pound of common Salt, four ounces of Salt-peter, grind this together, and put one pound of Quick Silver into the bottom of a glass body, place it in sand, so that the sand do not come above the matter in the glass; put a head thereupon, and give it a convenient fire, and the sublimate will stick to the sides of the glass, which is . to be used to your work. i Take the above prepared AQUA VITAE, and add to eight ounces of it, three ounces of Salt-peter-water, and distill it out of a coated glass retort, and you will have an ounce of the AQUA VITAE remain behind fixed.

Take unbumt potshards ground small, and with three parts of the same, grind one part of purified Salt-peter; put into the receiver half a pound of water to one pound of Salt-peter, and force the Spirits over into it. That which is fixed with this water, put into a glass body, and pour upon it the common AQUA VITAE VITRIOLI, so that it be four fingers high upon it. Then distill it till the matter becomes dry. Take out this matter, and dry it yet more, that the rest of those corrosive Spirits may evaporate; then edulcorate it well with Spirit of wine, and the medicine is prepared. THE USE Three or four grains of this Medicine being taken in some good treacle for some days, cures the french-pox, nay, there is no sore so old and festered, but is cured infallibly by it.

THE PREPARATION OF A MEDICINE OUT OF COMMON SULPHUR. Take common Sulphur, and grind it small. Then grind with it three parts of calcined Vitriol, put it together into a high Cucurbit, and sublime it in sand, till nothing will sublime more. Take then these flowers, put them into a glass, and pour on them a common AQUA VITAE TARTARI, which has been dissolved in a Cellar, so that it swims on the top of it a hands breadth. Place it in a convenient heat, and the Sulphur will open itself in few hours, and become transparent red like a Ruby. This being done, pour off the extraction into another glass, and put to it very good distilled Vinegar, and the Sulphur falls to the bottom with a great stink. Pour off the AQUA VITAE, and edulcorate well the Sulphur, and dry it gently. Put this Sulphur again into another glass Cucurbit, and pour upon it Spirit of wine, which is prepared with Philosophical Tartar, set it in heat for three days, and the Spirit of wine imbibes again that excellent Tincture of the Sulphur: Then pour off the extraction, and draw off the Spirit of wine with a pretty strong fire in sand, and there will come over with it a pleasant sweet smelling AQUA VITAE. Having done so, rectifie the Oil in BALNEO MARIE, and draw off the Spirit of wine gently, and the AQUA VITAE SULPHUREOUS remains in the bottom. THE USE OF THIS MEDICINE .

THE PREPARATION OF THE TINCTURE OF CORALS. Take red corals, break them into pieces, and pour on them a common Spirit of Salt, and the corals will be dissolved. This being done, draw off by distillation the Spirit of Salt, and edulcorate them well. Then take to one marck of this powder, half an ounce of common Sulphur pulverised, and having mingled it to-gether, reverberate it very gently, till all the Sulphur be burnt away.

Take likewise Crabs Eyes, put them into another glass, and pour on them of the same liquor: Let it stand pretty hot for fourteen days and nights, and there will rise from both a moisture, which pour off together very clean into a little body of glass, and rectifie it in BALNEO MARIE, and the liquor remains behind.

Take this burned Chalk, pour upon it, and then draw from it again several times an AQUA FORT made of Vitriol and Salt-peter. Dissolve it afterwards in a Cellar. Distill that which is dis-solved into an Oil with a strong fire. Digest with this Oil a Calx of Luna opened with AQUA FORT for a month. Reduce this Calx \"by melting it down with Salt-peter, and Sal armoniac, and refine it with Saturn, then separate it, and you will have a white fixed Luna, which lay for a day and night in an AQUA FORT, and you have good Gold which endures all trials. L. D. THE PREPARATION OF THE GREAT PHILOSOPHIC STONE. Lastly, to close up all, I will now instruct you from the love I \"bear to God, how I have made my Universal Medicine, or the Philo-sophers Stone, which many Master-\"builders have wrought upon, and will discover faithfully and truly all my Manual Operations. You must know, that our Stone is made out of its own proper essence, for it transmutes other Metals into real and true Gold, which Gold must \"be prepared, and \"become a better Stone. And though nothing of another nature must be used in the preparation of our Stone, which might obstruct its Majestic Excellency, yet the pre-paration of it in the beginning cannot be made without means. But observe, that,as you will hear afterwards, all corrosives must be washed away again from it and separated, so that our Stone may be severed from all poison, and be prepared to be the greatest Medicine."},{"pageNumber":362,"pageContent":"But I beseech you for Gods sake, that you will keep your tongue, and put a seal to your lips, that you may not discover what you learn out of this, such an increadible worldly excellency, to the impenitent and unworthy, that you may not participate of other mens sins where there is no need, and thereby prepare for your-self the way to Hell and everlasting Damnation, which God Almighty graciously keep and preserve you from. Wherefore observe my words, and lay to heart my sayings, do not dislike it, that I simply relate these things, for many words avail little here. Neither let it trouble you, that the work may seem slight unto you, but consider the end that will follow. For inconsiderable is both the beginning of the work, and the work itself: But the end is high and excellent, all which knowledge and experience will dis-cover and bring to light. Now I do proceed in the Name of the Lord to the work itself. Take of the very best Gold you can have, one part, of good HUNGARIAN Antimony six parts, melt this together upon a fire, and pour it out into such a pot as the goldsmiths use; when you have poured it out it .becomes a REGULUS. This same REGULUS must be melted again, that the Antimony may be separated from it. This being done, add to it Mercury, and melt it again, and cleanse it again. Repeat this the third time; and the Gold is purged and purified enough for the beginning of the work. Then beat the Gold very thin, as goldsmiths do, when they gild, and make an AMALGAMA with common Quick-silver, which must be squeezed through a leather; let the Quick-silver fume away by little and little upon a gentle fire, that nothing of it may remain with the Gold, and stir it about continually with a small iron, and the Gold is become subtile, so that its water may the better work upon it, and open it."},{"pageNumber":363,"pageContent":"The preparation of the Water . Take one part of Salt-peter well purified, and grind with it the like quantity of Sal-armoniac, and half as much of Pebbles very well cleansed and washed. Mingle all these ingredients to-gether, and put them into an earthen retort, and the Spirits may not come through, put the same into a distilling furnace: The retort must have a pipe behind, and put as large a receiver as you can get to the retort, the receiver must lie in a vessel full of cold water, and a wet linen-cloth must be put round about it, which you must wet continually with another wet cloth; then put again so much matter into the retort, till all is gone into it, and then your water is prepared. Take then of the prepared Calx of Gold one part, put it into a glass body, and pour three parts of the abovemade Water upon it, and place it in warm ashes, and the Gold will dissolve in it; but if it should not altogether be dissolved, pour more fresh water upon it, and it will dissolve all. This being done, pour it out into another glass, and let it stand till it become cold, and it will let fall some feces, which separate by pouring the water from them into another glass, set this glass in BALNEUM MARIE, and put a head upon it, let it stand in heat day and night, and more feces will settle, which separate from it as before. Close up your glass very well after you have put on the head, and lute another glass to the head, and let it stand for fourteen days in a gentle heat, that the body may well be opened. This being done increase the fire, and distill off the phlegm to a thickness, that it remain in the bottom like an AQUA VITAE. That which has been distilled, pour again into the body, having first made it warm, and lute again the head to it, and let it stand to digest a day and night. Then draw off the water again by distillation, and pour it again warm upon it. Repeat this so long till the Gold is come over altogether into a low body with a flat bottom. Put this spiritualized solution of Gold again into a glass, and 336."},{"pageNumber":364,"pageContent":"pour on it a considerable quantity of rain-water, putting thereto three parts of live Mercury to one of Gold: But you must squeeze first the Mercury through a leather, and stir it very well to-gether, and you will see many wonderful colours; and if you do repeat this, stirring several times, there will fall an AMALGAMA to the bottom, and the water will become clear. This being done, decant the water, and dry gently the AMALGAMA, which having edulcorated very well, put it upon a broad shallow earthen platter, under a cover, stirr it about continually with an iron wire, till all the Quick-silver be fumed away, and there will remain upon the earthen platter a very fair powder of a purple colour. Afterwards you must prepare your Spirit of wine with the Philo-sophical Tartar, in the manner following. First of all you are to know, that the Tartar of the Philosophers, whereby the Lock is unlocked, is not like unto common Tartar, as many do think; but it is another Salt, and springs from one root; and this is the only Key to open and to dissolve Metals, and is prepared as follows. Take ashes of a Vine, which has born Grapes, that have yielded good wine; make of them with warm water as strong -a Lee, as possibly can be made. When you have a considerable quantity of this Lee, boil it away, and coagulate it to a dryness, and there remains a reddish matter. Put this matter into a rever-berating furnace, and reverberate it for three days, or there-abouts, in an open fire, that the flame may play very well upon it, and stir it continually, till the matter is become white. Afterwards dissolve this reverberated matter in fountain-water, and let it settle, pour off the clear, and filtre it, that all the feces may be separated, and coagulate it in a glass-body, and you will have a pure white Salt of Tartar, from which a true Spirit is drawn. 337."},{"pageNumber":365,"pageContent":"Take now high rectified Spirit of wine, fully freed from its phlegm, put the same into a glass-phiol, with as long a neck as possibly you can get.

The remaining feces, and some phlegm staying behind with them, are to be put away. This is now the right Spirit of wine, wherewith you may open that which the lover of Art desires to know, for it is become penetrant by preparation. Take now the powder of Gold of a purple colour, and having put it into another phiol, pour on it your Spirit of wine; put it very close luted in a gentle heat, and it will extract the Sul-phur of Gold within four and twenty hours, of a high red colour like blood. Having done so, that it does not yield any Tincture more, pour off the extraction very clear into a little glass-body. The remainder is a white Calx, pour upon this Calx the afore said Spirit of wine, and let it stand in putrifaction, having the glass well-stopped for fourteen days and nights; and the Spirit of wine will become of a white colour like milk, which pour off clear, and pour upon it fresh Spirit of wine, let it stand a day and night longer, and it will be coloured again, but not so much; add this to the first, and what remains do not dry, but leave it in the glass. Put the white extraction into a little body, and distill the phlegm from it, till it be reduced to a small quantity. This being done, put the glass in a cellar, and there will shoot from it fair and transparent crystals, which having taken out, put the remainder again in a cellar, and you will have more cry-stals, which put together into a body of glass, for it is the Salt of the Philosophers, and pour half the extraction of the Sulphur of Gold upon them, and they will dissolve immediately,"},{"pageNumber":366,"pageContent":"and melt like butter in hot water: And then distill it together out of a glass-body in hot ashes, and it will come over together in a form of a red oil, which falls to the bottom, and the Spirit of wine swims upon the top which separate from it.

The other half of the extraction must be distilled gently in BALNEO MARIE to a dryness, that the Spirit of wine may be separ-ated. Pour on it this Oil of Gold, or Potable Gold, and it takes up the powder in a moment, and becomes a much higher colour than it was before; and this will dissolve in common Spirit of wine, and other wine, as red as a Ruby; which constantly and wonderfully cures all such distempers of the body, as have their original from within. Then take that other part of Mercury of pure Gold, which you have kept, and pour all this being its own Oil upon it; and dis-till by an alembick, but not too strongly, and there comes over some phlegm, and the Oil does precipitate its own Mercury, and becomes white again, the greenness being lost and gone. This work being done likewise, get a Philosophical Egg, which the Philosophers call their Heaven, and you will find two parts of the Oil in weight to one part of the precipitated Mercury. Put then the Mercury into a glass, and add the Oil of Gold to it. So that one part of the glass may be filled, and three parts remain empty. Seal it well, as HERMES teaches, and put it into the three-fold Furnace, so that it stand not hotter than an egg, which is under a hen to be hatched; and the matter will begin to putrifie within a month, and become very black; which when it does appear, it is then certain that the matter is open by the putrifaction, and you may be glad of that happy beginning. Increase now the fire to the second degree, and the blackness will vanish away in time, and change into many admirable colours. These colours being gone likewise, increase the fire to the third degree, and"},{"pageNumber":367,"pageContent":"your glass will look like Silver, and the Rays will become ponder-ous.

He that has obtained this, may render thanks to God his Creator, for poverty has forsaken him: Diseases will fly from him, and wisdom has possession of him. For this noble Medicine is such a Stone, to which nothing in the world may be compared for virtue, riches, power, honour and might; but it is to be preferred before all earthly things, which the whole Universe does comprehend. Having thus prepared your Medicine, if you intend to multiply it, you must proceed as follows.\" Take of the prepared powder of Gold, of a purple colour, as you have done before, three parts.

OF THINGS NATURAL AND SUPERNATURAL . Because I purpose to write of the first Tincture, and Root of Metals and Minerals, and to give an account of their Spiritual essence, how the Metals and Minerals are in the \"beginning Spirit-ually conceived, and corporally brought forth: It is therefore necessary to premise something, and to inform you in few words, that all things are divided into Natural and Supernatural; and whatsoever is visible, comprehensible, and formal, the same is Natural: But that which is Incomprehensible and Spiritual, the same is Supernatural, and must be apprehended and judged of by faith; as there is the Creation, and first of all the Eternity of God, which is infinite, unsearchable, and unmeasurable, which Nature is not capable of, neither can Humane reason comprehend it. This now is Supernatural, which transcends reason, and is apprehended by faith, which therefore is a divine thing, and belongs to Divinity, which judges of Mens Souls. Secondly, and moreover there belong to Supernatural things the Angels of God, which have clarified bodies, and do perform such things by permission of their Creator, which otherwise no Creat-ure is able to do, because their works are hidden from the eyes of all the world; as likewise the works of the hellish Spirits and Devils are abstruse, which they work by the providence of the most high God. But above all the great works of God are found and discovered to be Supernatural, because they cannot be compre-hended, nor judged of by the thoughts of Men; as there is especially the mercy of God, and his great benefits, which out of his tender love he shows unto, and bestows upon Mankind, which indeed no Man is capable to discern and know comprehensively: And likewise other great miracles wrought at sundry times by Christ our Saviour and Redeemer, to the confirmation of his Omnipotency and Majesty: 3^5."},{"pageNumber":373,"pageContent":"As where he had raised LAZARUS from the dead; and likewise the daughter of FAIRUS Ruler of the SYNAGOGUE, and then the Son of the Widow of NAIN. He has made the dumb and speechless to SPEAK, the Deaf to Hear, and the Blind to See; which indeed are all Supernatural things, and wonderful works of God: As also his Conception, Resurrection, Descension to Hell, and Ascension to Heaven; which are too high and abstruse for Nature, and are to be attained unto only by faith. Amongst Supernatural things are likewise to be counted ELIAS, and ENOCH'S Ascension into Heaven. The Rapture of Saint Paul, who was taken up into the Third Heaven in the Spirit. Further-more, there are many Supernatural things performed by imagination dreams, and visions, as very often many Miracles are wrought by imagination, as the speckled and spotted sheep were conceived by the speckled sticks laid in the water. The wise men from the East were warned by God in a dream, not to return again to Herod. Their Three Persons likewise, and their Three Gifts and Presents have a peculiar and mystical sense; as also the Supernatural Star And the Dream of PILATIS wife, who falsly condemned Jesus Christ our Lord and Saviour, has not been Natural. Neither can the Vision of the Holy Angels, who appeared to the shepheards at the Nativity of Christ, and to the Woman, who came to the Sepulcher of Christ, to see where his body was laid, be accounted Natural. Moreover, there have been often wrought many Supernatural thing by the Prophesies of the Saints and Prophets. Thus was the voice of the Ass that spoke to BILEAM, not agreeable to common Nature; and interpretation of Dreams by JOSEPH was likewise Supernatural. God preserves us many times by his Holy Angels, from great and sad accidents, and delivers us from perils and dangers, which otherwise naturally would be impossible. All this, and what else there may be, does belong to Divinity and Heavenly things, and are to be regarded by the Soul. There are besides these other Supernatural things of the visible Creat-ures of God, as we do find, see, and discern in the firmament,"},{"pageNumber":374,"pageContent":"planets, and stars, together with the Elements, which indeed are \"beyond our reason, their course only being observed by the spec-ulations of Arithmetic. This now belongs to Astronomy, and is a visible, nevertheless incomprehensible being, performing its operation magnetically, wherein likewise many miracles are dis-covered and found, which are altogether Supernatural. For you are to understand, that Heaven works upon Earth, and the Earth keeps correspondency with Heaven: For the Earth has likewise Seven Planets in it, which are brought forth and wrought upon by the Seven Heavenly Planets, only by a Spiritual impression and infusion; and in this manner all the Minerals are wrought by the Stars. This now is done Spiritually beyond our apprehension, and therefore to be accounted not Natural, in the manner of two, that are enamoured. The men are visible, the love is invisible, which they bear one to another. The body of man is Spiritual and nat-ural; but the love is invisible, Spiritual, incomprehensible, and Supernatural, comparable to nothing else than to a Magnetical attraction. For the invisible love, which out of affection is Spiritually attracted by imagination, is perfected by consummat-ion. In like manner, when Heaven bears love to the Earth, and the Earth has love, inclination, and affection for man, as the great world for the little one, because the little world is taken out of the great, and when the Earth through the desire of an invisible imagination does attract such love of the Heavens, then is there a conjunction made of the Superior with the Inferior, like unto a Husband and his Wife, which are accounted one body: And after such a conjunction the Earth becomes impregnated by such infusion of the Superior Heaven, and begins to bear a birth, according to the infusion, which birth is ripened, after its conception, by the Elements, and is digested to a perfect maturity. This is likewise numbered and accounted amongst Supernatural things, viz., how the Supernatural essence does perform its operation upon the Natural. 3^7."},{"pageNumber":375,"pageContent":"There are furthermore numbered amongst Supernatural things, all Magical and Caballistical things, being subject thereunto, which do spring from the light of true knowledge; not such as have their original from Superstition, or unlawful conjuration used by those that conjure the Devil. This Magick is here not understood by me; but such as was practised by those wise men or Magi, which came from the East, who gave their judgement of things by the inspiration of God, according to the true and unforbidden Art, which likewise was used by the Ancients, the EGYPTIANS and ARA-BIANS, who before writing was invented, did note, observe, and remember their things by Signs and Characters. Neither is the use of such blessings forbidden, which Christ the Son of God himself did make use of, as the Scripture does tell us: And he took the Children, laid his hands upon them, and blessed them. But those that are against God, and his word, are justly to be rejected, and not to be permitted, for they are not Divine, but Devillish; but such Supernatural things, which are not contrary to God, nor his Holy Word, they belong to Magick, which is no way hurtful to the Soul. Concerning Visions, Apparitions, and the like, for they have oftentimes happened unto Holy Men, they are likewise deservedly counted amongst not Natural things. For whatsoever a Man may apprehend by speculation and reasoning, that is Supernatural; on the contrary, whatsoever he may handle, see, and feel, that is Natural. Thirdly, the third part of things Natural and Supernatural, does consist in the Medicine or Physic, arising out of every ones hidden power and virtue; which Medicine made of anything, must be expelled out of a visible, palpable, and Natural body; and be reduced into a Spiritual, Exalted, and Supernatural operation: That so the Spirit, which in the beginning was infused into, and granted to that body for its life, may be unlocked, and rendered penetrant to work, as a Spiritual Essence and fire, to which there are left its Vent-holes to burn, and so finds no obstacle 3^8."},{"pageNumber":376,"pageContent":"that might choak, suppress, or hinder the \"burning life: Otherwise where the separation of the Soul and Spirit from the body does not go before, there can no operation of any efficacy or advantage follow, according as necessity requires: For whatsoever is vis-ible, palpable, and unseparated bodily, is Natural and corporeal,' but as soon as the separation is made, that which is quick leaves the dead, recovers its perfect operation, and, because the Natural body is separated the Spiritual Essence is loosened and freed to penetrate, and is become a Spiritual Supernatural Medicine. To sum up all, all things, nothing excepted, that may be handled and felt are Natural, but they must be made a Medicine be prepared out of them. For the Supernatural alone has in it a lively and quick virtue to work, but the Natural has but a dead palpable form. For when ADAM was Created, he was dead, and had no life of any virtue; but as soon as the operating, quickning Spirit entered into him, he showed his lively virtue and power by Super-natural admiration. In everything therefore, both Natural and Supernatural are copulated as one, and joined together in their habitation, that every thing may be perfect. For of all things created in the whole world, some are Supernatural, as concerning only things Spiritual and of the Soul: But some are Natural and Supernatural together, as concerning the Elements and the firmament; and such are the Minerals, Vegetables, and Animals: Which is discerned and found so to be, when these are separated one from the other, that the Soul goes out of the body, and the Spirit forsakes its Soul, and leaving the body an empty habitation. You are furthermore to understand and to observe, that both the great and the little world are made, formed, and Created out of one and the same first matter, by an infinite and omnipotent essence, in the beginning at that time, when the Spirit of God moved upon the water, who had been from eternity without beginning. The great world, that is, Heaven and Earth, was made first; and then the little world, which is Man, was made and formed out of the 3^9 •"},{"pageNumber":377,"pageContent":"great, and the water separated from the Earth. The water was the Matter, upon which the everlasting Spirit of God moved: Out of the noblest Earth, as its quintessence, was formed the aquosity, which as yet was with the Earth, and all this was only Natural; but after the inspiration of the warm Divine breath, there came presently the Supernatural to it, that so Natural and Supernatural were united and copulated. The great world is transitory, though there shall be a new Earth or world; but the little world is ever-lasting. The great transitory created world will be reduced into nothing, as it has been made out of nothing: But the little world will be clarified by the Spirit of God, because he has the possess-ion of it, and will make out of the first terrestrial water, an heavenly clarified water. Then will follow, that the first matter has been changed into the last, and the last matter is made the first again. The reason why the great world is transitory, is, because the Spirit of God does not keep his seat and habitation in the great, but in the little world: For the-Man is the Temple of the Holy Ghost, except he maliciously do defile himself to Hell-fire; that so there might be a difference and that Spirit remain in the little world, which he has formed after his own image, and made it a Holy Temple, Besides this, there are all things in the little world, which are found in the great, viz., Heaven and Earth, together with the Elements, and what belongs to them of the firmament. We do likewise find, that in the first Creation, which was out of nothing, there did arise three things; an essence like to the Soul, and a Spiritual, and a visible one, which did present a Mer-curial Water, a Sulphureous stream of brimstone, and a terrestrial Salt. These three gave a complete and perfect, palpable and formal body to all things, wherein especially are found all the four Elements perfect. But of this I have already made mention in my writings, but more particularly in a book of mine DE MICROSOSME. But to speak something more of Natural and Supernatural and corporeal we do find, that the Woman of CANAAN was cured of her"},{"pageNumber":378,"pageContent":"bloody flux, which had lasted twelve years, by a touching only, having only touched the Garment of the Son of God; which distemper of hers was Natural, but the Medicine was Supernatural, because she had obtained this remedy of Christ the Lord by her faith. In like manner do we see an excellent, high Supernatural miracle in those three Men, SADRACH, MESACH, and ABEDNEGO, who being cast into the fiery furnace, by the commandment of King NEBUCHADNEZER, were miraculously without any hurt delivered by Gods mighty power, Dan. 3• Thus likewise the confusion of Tongues, and infusion of several languages, which happened at the foolish building of the Tower of BABEL, which should reach Heaven, has been reputed a Supernatural wonder and miracle. Furthermore, it was a Supernatural sign, that those ISRAELITES, which should fight against the Army of the MIDIANITES, according to Gods command, must lap of the water with their Tongues as a dog laps. And the sending abroad of the Dove out of the Ark of NOAH, which brought with her a green Olive-leaf, as a token of mercy, was a Divine and Supernatural message. That the Holy Man of God MOSES did strike with his staff the hard rock, and the waters gushed out of it at this stroak does transcend humane reason. And it is no less Supernatural, that the Salt-water must become a sweet water fit to be drunk. And likewise the dry passage of the Isralites through the Red-sea, and that AARENS staff did blossom are all Supernatural things. To sum up all, that Christ the Eternal Son of God did raise himself out of the Sepulcher through the sealed stone: That he appeared to the two Disciples that went to EMAUS: And that he manifested himself to his Disciples, the doors being fast and shut, these are things Divine and Supernatural. I could alledge more examples out of the Holy Scriptures, but I shall pass them over for brevity's sake. Amongst Supernatural things are likewise numbered all such signs as happen in mines,of bodily Apparitions of Spirits, Images, Faries, and Dwarfs, which in several kinds visibly do appear, and"},{"pageNumber":379,"pageContent":"do prognosticate either good or bad success, ruin or riches: As also all the figures of Metals, and other shapes which are found in the Earth, of Men, Fishes, and other Beasts, framed and formed through the imagination of the three principles, but digested and ripened by the Earth and other Elements. Whereunto do belong likewise the Monsters of the Earth, and such like things as are found in the Earth at some certain times, of a wonderful form and shape, after the expiration of which times they are not to be found, and yet on another time they do appear again. To these we may refer all such shapes as are seen by means of water, looking-glasses, which yet are of a different nature. For some are Natural only, and yet yield Supernatural shapes; But other some are produced by conjuration, which are neither Natural nor Supernatural, but devilish; and therefore they belong to Witch-craft, and pious Christians are prohibited to practice them: As likewise all such means, as are-contrary to the Holy Scripture, Gods word and Commandments, are justly rejected and refuted by the true natural Cabalists. I do speak this, that you may make a due difference, and a certain order of Natural, Supernatural, and not Natural things. Of the number of Supernatural things are likewise all water Spirits, as SYRENS, SUCCUBI, and other water Nymphts, and what belongs to them. As also the Spirits that are inhabitants of the Earth, and those of the Fire, which are heard, seen, and perceived; which bring sometime tidings of death, or some other mischance; and sometimes do show, in certain places, riches and treasure, by apparition. To which you may add the Spirits of Fire, which do appear in the shape of fire, or form of a burning candle; which indeed are all Spirits, and have impalpable bodies; but they are not such Spirits as those Spirits of Hell, which do hunt after mens Souls, as the most precious jewel, as hellish Lucifer, the Devil and his com-plices do; which have been cast out with him: But they are such Spirits, which above Nature are the objects of\"Mens admiration,"},{"pageNumber":380,"pageContent":"and live only \"by the Elements, and are sustained and fed by them, and with the dissolution of this Terrestrial World, will be anni-hilated and vanish away, because there is no redeemed Soul in them. I shall not insist longer upon this, but leave a further declar-ation of these circumstances for another occasion, when I shall give you a singular account of Visions, and Shapes, and Spiritual Apparitions, which by the greater part of the world are accounted to be not Natural, and yet are truely Natural, but they are found Supernatural in their operation and wonderful quality. For the further confirmation of my purpose, I do say, that there are many things to be found in Medicine, which do show forth and perform their operation Supernaturally, after a magnetical manner, working only by an attractive Spiritual power, which is attracted through the Air; because the Air is the MEDIUM betwixt the Med-icine, and the disease or distemper. Like as the Loadstone always longs for, and turns itself to its Star, though this Star be many thousand of miles distant from it, yet is the Spiritual operation and affection so powerful be-twixt these two, that they are drawn together by that MEDIUM, the Air, at so great and vast a distance, but because this attractive power is generally acknowledged by all men, it is grown a meer CUSTOM, and so it is held, and nothing more of abstruseness obser-ved, what the original is of this operating power. In like manner may distempers and\" sores be cured and healed, though the patient and the Physician be far enough distant one from the other, not by Benedictions or Conjurations, and other unlawful prohibited means, which are contrary to God and Nature; but by such means, wherein there is a magnetical attractive power to perform such things. As when a patient goes away, and leaves the weapon wherewith he has been wounded, or some of the blood which issued forth from the wound, with the Physician; if he do proceed orderly using the right means, as one uses in binding up and dressing of a wound, he will certainly recover his former"},{"pageNumber":381,"pageContent":"health. This is no Witchcraft, but this healing is performed by the attractive power of the Medicine, which by means of the Air is conveyed to the wound, and thereby cleansed, for the performing of this Spiritual operation. These expressions will seem hard to many, and impossible to Nature, and many will say this relation is against Nature, where-by they will be moved to dispute and to argue this question, whether it be Natural, or no? Whether it be possible or no? Or whether this cure be not Witchcraft? I shall compose the difference thus: That this cure is Natural, but the operation of the cure is Supernatural, because it is per-formed only in an attractive incomprehensible manner. And that this manner of curing or healing is no Witchcraft, I do demon-strate thus, because it is not mixed with any Witchcraft, nor any other means, which are either unnatural, or contrary to God the Creator, and his Holy saving word; but being only Natural, out of their Supernatural, invisible, incomprehensible, Spiritual, and attractive power, which has its original from the Stars, and performs its operation through the Elements. Lastly, that this cure is no Witchcraft, I do prove thus; be-cause the Devil takes rather a delight and pleasure in the sad mischances of mankind, then that he should administer any help for the welfare of Men: Which besides he cannot possibly perform without Gods providence and gracious permission. Much more might be written of this magnetical form, but to pre-vent divers errors, I will let it alone, till I come to speak something DE MIRACULIS NATURALIBUS, or Natural Miracles of the World. Those gross and silly head-pieces, which nevertheless account themselves to be very wise Masters of Philosophy, and all such as have not the perfect use of their senses, cannot find any differnece in these things. But he that is wise and understanding, knows to distinguish the Natural from the Supernatural. For do but observe and consider this similitude, to demonstrate the truth 35^."},{"pageNumber":382,"pageContent":"of this thing by a rude example, that there are found many beasts, which die in the Winter, and lie dead, so that there is no life to be discerned in them: But as soon as the warm Slimmer does draw nigh, the natural heat gives them a new life, that the reputed carcase is fully revived in the same substance, it has had in its' living motion. Like an Herb, which dies in Winter, and does appear new and fresh again in the Spring. Now the dying of such things is to be counted Natural, but the restoring them to a new life is in its knowledge Supernatural. But because men are used to these things, therefore the least part of them does regard that which deserves a further enquiry, and give over the thoughts of things both Natural and Supernatural. Moreover, the greatest part of Men do pass by inbred and natural dispositions, which are likewise Supernatural; as also abortions, and such as bring some tokens with them into the world, which indeed are Natural, but through the occasioned imagination show themselves Supernatural, which Supernatural form, and Supernatural impressions have been produced by the Mother of the child through thoughts arising, which unawares, and as it were by accident have happened unto her. As we do see and find many a time, that many men have naturally inbred gestures, which they are never able to leave, though they endeavour it never so much. This inbred thing is Natural, but the conception in the Mothers womb, caused by the imagination of such a thing, is Supernatural, and subject to that which is made by the impression of Heaven. Finally, if you will say that it is not true, that any one can defend that which is Supernatural, with certain grounds and rea-sons, except he has learned the Natural, which has its original and form from the Supernatural; yet he will (after he has studied it) by a certain invented experiment be capable to demonstrate that he is a conquerour of these that will not believe that which is Supernatural, and confute those that do presume to dispute of Natural things, and because they are ignorant of the foundation, do nothing but talk idely, and quarrel unprofitably."},{"pageNumber":383,"pageContent":"CHAPTER II. OF THE FIRST TINCTURE, THE ROOT OF METAL. To return to my purpose and undertaking, which is to discourse by Gods permission, and to give an account of the first Tincture, the Root and Birth of Metals and Minerals; it is to be observed, that the Tincture, which is the Root of all Metals, is likewise a Supernatural flying fiery Spirit, having its sustenance in the and looking naturally for its habitation in the Earth and Water, where it may rest and work. And this Spirit is found in all Metals, and more abundant in other Metals then Gold: For the Gold is very close, solid, and compact, by reason of its well digested, ripened, and fixed body; therefore it can no more enter into the body, than the body does need. But other Metals have not such a fixed body, but their pores are open and dispersed, therefore can the tinging Spirit abundantly more penetrate and possess them; but because the bodies of other Metals are unfixed, the Tincture likewise cannot stay with these unfixed bodies, but must go out of them. And being the Tincture of Gold does in no other Metal abound more than in iron and copper, as Husband and Wife, their bodies are destroyed, and the tinging Spirit from thence expelled, which breeds much blood in the opened prepared Gold, as by its feeding does make it volatile. Therefore when the volatile Gold is filled by its meat and drink, it takes up its own blood, does dry it up through its own internal fire, with help and addition of a moist fire, and is again a conquest, which does fix, nay, produces the highest fixedness, so that the Gold becomes a high fixed Medicine, and cannot make a body again, by the reason of the superabundant blood, except there be added to it a superfluous body, into which the abundant fixed blood does disperse Itself, which joined metallic body is penetrated by the exceeding great heat of the fixed blood of the Lion, like fire cleansed from all"},{"pageNumber":384,"pageContent":"impurity, and immediately ripened to a perfect maturity and fixed-ness: That thus the servent enriches first his Lord and Master, \"because the Lord cannot spare of his cloth to give away, by reason that Nature has granted him but one only Suit of Honour; and the King can distribute again the inheritance, and Court-cloths of his Kingdom to his servents, after he has first taken and gathered the Tribute of his subjects; that so the Master and servent may stay and continue together. Nor need you to wonder at this, that the King must borrow of his servents, because their bodies are not fixed and permanent, for they take up much, and can keep but small credit. But if the King can participate of it, he can better overcome heat and frost, than the leprous Metals. And thus he becomes by this participation a Regent and Conquerour, particularly of all others, with a great victory and triumph of riches and health to a long life. I hope you have understood and learned enough for the beginning of this discourse of Natural and Supernatural things and the first Tincture, the Root of Metals and Minerals, whereupon the Corner-stone is placed, and the true rock in general is founded, wherein Nature has placed, and concealed, or buried her abstruse and deep hidden gift, viz., in the fiery and tinged Spirits, which Tincture they got from the Starry Heaven, by the operation of the Elements, and are made able further to tinge and to fix, that which had no tincture, and was unfixed before: Because that LUNA wants the Suit of the golden Crown, together with the fixedness, as also SATURN, JUPITER, and MERCURY. And though MARS and VENUS do not want this clothing, but may communicate the same to the other five; yet do I say, that they can do nothing for the gaining of riches without the Lion, because they are not for their need, provided with the fixedness of their Mercury, and the flexibleness of their Salt; except the Lion has overcome them in the fight, and they are notably mended and bettered which melioration lyes hidden in the Signate Star, or their Load-stone, from which all the Metals have received their gifts."},{"pageNumber":385,"pageContent":"I do proceed, and in specie pass to the birth and to the generat-ion, how the ARCHEUS does show and pour forth its power, and dis-plays it, by which all the Metallic and Mineral forms are exposed to the view, and are made formal, palpable, and corporeal, through the Mineral, incomprehensible flying, fiery Spirits. Furthermore', you are to know, and with all diligence to observe, not to pass by with oblivion that which is of great concernment, nor to look over that which is most advantageous, and on the contrary to note all along the meer writing, not regarding the drift and scope: For of that I do write here, the highest will be undoubtedly accounted and esteemed by many the lowest, and the slightest the highest mystery. First of all you are to know, that all the Metals and Minerals of the Earth have one only matter, and one only Mother, by which they in general altogether have received their conception and perfect bodily birth. And this matter, which comes from the Center, does divide itself in the beginning into three parts, to produce some corporeal thing, and a certain form of every Metal. These three parts are fed and nourished by the Elements in the Earth out of its body, till they become perfect. But the matter, which has its original from the Centre, is framed by the Stars, wrought by the Elements, formed by that which is Terrestrial, and is a known matter, and the true Mother of Metals and Minerals: And is such a matter and Mother,out of which Man himself has been conceived, born, nourished and made corporeal: And may be alto-gether compared to the middle world; for whatsoever is in the great world, that is likewise in the little, and whatsoever is in the little world, that is likewise in the great: And thus what is in the great and little world together, that is found likewise in the middle world, which joins the great and little world, and is a Soul, which does unite and copulate the Spirit with the body. This Soul is compared to Water, and is indeed a right true Water, yet does not wet like other Water, but it is an heavenly Water, found dry in a Metallic liquid substance, and a Soul like Water, 358."},{"pageNumber":386,"pageContent":"which loves all Spirits, and does unite them with their \"bodies, and brings them to a perfect life. Therefore it is certain, that the Water is a Mother of all Metals, which being heated by a warm Aereal fire, as is the Spirit of Sulphur, brings life into the terrestrial body through its ripening, wherein the Salt is appar-' ently found, which does preserve from putrefaction, that nothing may be consumed by corruption. In the beginning, and in the birth is wrought first of all the Quick-silver, which yet lies open with a subtil coagulation, because there is but little of the Salt communicated to it; whereby it shows more a Spiritual, than a corporeal body. Other Metals, which are derived from its Ess-ence, and have more Salt, which makes them corporeal, do follow after this. I begin with the Spirit of Mercury. • CHAPTER III. OF THE SPIRIT OF MERCURY . Although I do use a peculiar style in my writings, which will seem strange to many, yet there is sufficient cause for it. It is sufficient, I say, to insist upon my experience, and not to regard other mens idle speeches, because I have attained to the knowledge of these things, and seeing goes always before hearing; and that which has its foundation is preferred before that, which has no ground at all. Therefore, I say, that all visible, and palpable things are made out of the Spirit of Mercury, which is beyond all the terrestrial things of the whole world, and all things are made out of it, and have their original from it. For therein is all to be found, that can do all, what the Artist does desire to enquire into. It is the principle to work Metals, being made a Spiritual Essence, which is a meer Air, and flys to and fro without wings, and is a moving wind, which after its expul-sion out of its habitation by VULCAN,is driven into its CHAOS,"},{"pageNumber":387,"pageContent":"into which it entrets again, and does resolve itself itno the Elements, where, it is attracted \"by the Stars, after a magnetical manner, out of love, from whence it went forth, and was wrought out \"before, because it desired to be united again with its like. But when the Spirit of Mercury can be taken, and made corporeal, it does then resolve itself into a body, and becomes a clear, fair, and transparent Water, which is true Spiritual Water, and the first Mercurial Root of Minerals and Metals, Spiritual, un-perceiveable, incombustible, without any commixition of the terr-estrial aquosity. It is that heavenly Water, of which much has been written, for by this Spirit of Mercury all Metals may be, if need requires, dissolved, opened, and without any corrosive reduced or resolved into their first Matter. This Spirit renews both Man and Beast, like the EAGLE; consumes whatsoever is bad, and produces a great Age to a long life. This Spirit of Mercury is the chief Key of all my other Keys, of which I have written in the beginning. Therefore will I call; Come ye blessed of the Lord, be ye anointed with Oil, and refreshed with Water: Embalme your bodies, that they may not putrifie, get a bad scent and stink: For the heavenly Water is the beginning, and the Oil a medium, which does not burn, because it is made out of a Spiritual Sulphur; and the balsom of Salt is corporeal, which is united with the Water by means of the Oil; whereof I shall give you hereafter a more ample account, where I do intend to speak and to write, some-thing more concerning these things. And to declare further the Essence, matter and form of this Spirit of Mercury; I must tell you, that its Essence is Soul like, its matter Spiritual, and its form terrestrial, which yet must be understood by some incomprehensible thing. These are indeed hard words and expressions, and there are many that will think, that these are vain and idle repetitions, and strange sayings, which do produce nothing else but strange thoughts. Is is true, I confess, they are strange, and do require strange people that will understand the meaning of them. It is not a thing written"},{"pageNumber":388,"pageContent":"for country-men, how they must grease their'wagons: Nor is it a speech for those, which have not got the knowledge of this Art, though they imagine themselves to \"be never so wise. But this man alone I do repute to he learned,which \"besides the word of God, does make enquiry by a true knowledge into terrestrial things, which come under the judgement of reason, and learns to know the darkness out of light, and to choose the seeming bad before the good. Touching the beginning of this Spirit of Mercury, this is need-less to know, because it is of no benefit, nor can it do you any good. But observe, that its beginning is Supernaturally from Heaven, the Stars, and Elements, granted in the beginning of the first Creation, to enter further into a terrestrial being. And because this is needless, as I have told you, leave that which is Heavenly to the Soul, and apprehend it by faith; that which is of the Stars, let likewise alone, because such impressions of the Stars are invisible and incomprehensible; the Elements have already brought forth this Spirit perfect into the world, through the nourishment of it, therefore do not meddle with them neither; for no man can make any Element but the Creator alone, and insist upon thy Spirit already produced, which is both formal and not formal, comprehensible and incomprehensible, and yet does appear visibly, and you have the first mateer, out of which are grown all Metals and Minerals, and is one only thing, and such a matter, which does unite itself with the Sulphur of the next following Chapter, and is coagulated with the Salt of the Fifth Chapter, so that it becomes one body and a perfect Medicine of all Metals, not only to generate in the beginning in the Earth, as in the great world, but also, with help of a moist fire, to change and transmute together with the augmentation in the little world. Let this not seem strange to you, because the most high has thus per-mitted it, and Nature has wrought it. There are many in the world which will not believe this, and do think it impossible, that vilifie and despise these mysteries, 361."},{"pageNumber":389,"pageContent":"which they in no wise understand. Those may continue in their folly like asses and blockheads, till they are illuminated, which does not happen without the will of God, \"but comes by his provid-ence. But wise and experienced men, which have wrought in the sweat of their brows, will bear me witness, and confirm the truth*; and likewise avouch, that they really believe and think, that whatsoever I do write here, is nothing but truth, as true as Hea-ven and Hell is made and ordained for the elect and damned, for a reward of good and evil. I do not write with my hands only, but my heart and Soul does compell and urge me to do it, because that many conceited, illuminated, reputed skillful worldlings do hate, envy; disparage, rail at, and persecute this mystery to the outmost skin, or to the inmost kernal, which has its orig-inal from the Centre. But I am sure, that time will come, when my marrow is vanished, and these bones of mine is dried up, that some people will sincerely take my part, though I am in my grave, and would be willing to fetch my from the dead, if God would permit it, but that will be a thing impossible. Therefore I have left them in writing, whereby their faith and confidence will have a seal of certainty and truth, to bear witness of me, what has been my last will and testament, which I have left to the poor, and to all the admirers of mysteries. Though it did not become me to write so many things, yet could I not, without doing hurt to my Soul do otherwise, then to drive a glance and brightness through the clouds, that the day may appear, and the obscure night, together with the cloudy and dark tempests may be dispersed. But how the ARCHAEUS works further by the Spirit of Mercury in the Earth, or in the veins of the Earth, you are to understand, that after the Spiritual Seed is framed from above by the impre-ssion of the Stars, and fed and nourished through the Elements, this Seed is changed into, and is become a Mercurial Water: As in the beginning the great world likewise was made of nothing; for the Spirit moved upon the Water, and thus was this cold, waterish, and terrestrial.Creature revived to life by an heavenly"},{"pageNumber":390,"pageContent":"warmth. It was in the great world the Power of God, and the operation of the light of Heaven; in the little world likewise the Power of God, and the operation \"by his divine and holy \"breath to work in the Earth. Furthermore, the Almighty did grant and ordain means, for the performing of the same, that the Creature • might get power to work upon another creature, and one might help and promote the other, for the performing and perfecting of all the works of the Lord. Thus was granted to the Earth an influence to generate by the luminaries of Heaven, and likewise an internal heat to warm & to ripen that which was too cold for the Earth, by reason of its aquosity, and thus every Creature a peculiar Genius according to its kind; that so there is raised a subtile Sulphureous steam by the starry Heaven; not a common, but another clarified, clean, and pure steam, separated from others, which do unite itself with the Mercurial substance; by which warm property in a long time the humidity is dried up by little and little, and then the Soul like property being joined with it, which gives the body and balsom of maintenance, and works before too upon the Earth by a Spiritual and Starry influence. Thus happens then a generation of Metals, according to the commixtion of the three principles, and according .as they take in more or less of these three, so the body is formed. If so be the Spirit of Mercury is directed and formed from above upon Animals, then is there produced an Animal being; but if it seizes upon Vegetables, a vegetable work is brought forth. And if it falls upon Minerals, by reason of its infused nature, there will spring thence Minerals and Metals. Nevertheless, every one is differently wrought: The Animals by another form by themselves, the Vegetables after a manner proper to-themselves, and the Minerals likewise in another fashion, every one after a singular way: Whereof in specie much more might be written, and a more full and exact relation might be made. Here may be justly demanded, how this Spirit of Mercury may be had and obtained, or how it is to be made, and which way, and after what manner it may be prepared, that it may cure distempers, 363."},{"pageNumber":391,"pageContent":"and. change and alter all Metals of the ignobler kind, as they are generated in the little world, \"by a transmutation and augmentat-ion of their seed? Many will expect an answer to this question, which I shall not keep back from them, but faithfully discover, as much as I have leave by Gods command and judgement, in the manner as follows. Take in the name of the Lord red mineral quicksilver, which looks like Cinnabar, and the best mineral Gold that can be gotten; take an equal quantity of them both, and grind them together, before they have been in any fire, pour upon them an Oil of Mer-cury made by itself, out of the common putrified and sublimed Quicksilver; digest them for a month, and you will have an ex-traction, which is more heavenly than terrestrial. Distill gently this extraction in BALNEO MARIE, and the phlegm comes over, and the ponderous Oil remains in the bottom, which takes up unto it-self all Metals in a moment. Add to this three times the quantity of Spirit of wine, circulate it in a pelican till it becomes blood red, and has recovered an incomparable sweetness. Pour off the Spirit of wine, and add to it fresh Spirit of wine. Repeat this so long, till the whole matter be dissolved into an exceed-ingly sweet and Ruby coloured transparent liquor, which mingle afterwards together. Pour it upon white calcined Tartar, and distill it with a strong fire in ashes, and the Spirit of wine remains behind with the Tartar, but the Spirit of Mercury comes over. This Spirit of Mercury being mixed with the Spirit of Sul-phur Solis, together with its Salt, whosoever shall bring them over thus joined and united together, that they may not be sep-arated in INFINITUM, he will have such a work (if so be it does receive its ferment in a due measure and prefixed term, with Gold by a solution, and is brought in its perfect maturity to a plus-quam perfection) to which nothing may be compared, for the pre-venting of diseases and poverty, and for a rich and superfluous recreation of the body as well as of goods. This is the way to obtain the Spirit of Mercury, which I have"},{"pageNumber":392,"pageContent":"discovered so far,as the Highest Emperior has given me leave to do. I hope you will use wisely and discreetly my Manual Operations required to this work, and laid open \"by me, that you may not suffer in Hell fire for my faithful warnings; \"because the door which gives entrance to the Kings Court, is unlocked and opened by one Key alone, which cures all distempers, as the Dropsie, Consumption, The Gout, The Stone, The Falling-sickness, Apoplexy, Leprosie, and of what name soever they be in general. This is like-wise a remedy for all sorts of French-pox, and all other old lasting sores, as the Wolf, Tetters, Worms, Fistules, Cancer, Spreading and fretting Ulcers and Holes, as I have discovered too, and hidden nothing from you. Finally, observe this, that you will make known only this, and no more, that, because any Art has its beginning and original from the Spirit of Mercury, which is quickened and revived by the Spiritual Sulphur, that an heavenly thing does rise from them together, and with, and by the Salt they become corporeal and formal; but the principal of the Soul, the Spirit, and the body, you will let it be and continue a Load-stone, as really it is, and connot be accounted to be any other thing. But the final sum is this, that without the Spirit of Mercury, which is the only Key to make the corporeal Gold Potable, the Philosophers Stone can never be made nor prepared. Do not object against, nor contradict this sentence, but keep silence: For I will give over speaking, because silence is imposed upon you and me by the competent judge, and begin the execution yourself, leaving further enquiry to another, which has not as yet pleaded his cause."},{"pageNumber":393,"pageContent":"CHAPTER IV. OF THE SPIRIT OF COPPER. The Star named VENUS is hard and very difficult to be reckoned, as all the Mathematicians and Astronomers must bear me witness; for her course does much differ from the other Six Planets, there-fore her Nativity is likewise of another nature; because the birth of VENUS does possess the first table after MERCURY. As concerning the generation of Metals, MERCURY makes effect-ual, but VENUS does incite, and gives lust and desire, together with beautifulness, which does occasion it. Though I do not esteem myself, nor take upon me to be an Astronomer, to whom the account of the heavenly motion is known, because I ought to spend my time in prayers in the House of God: Nevertheless, that the remainder of the time, after Divine service is performed, may not pass idley away, I have resolved to spend the rest of my time in en-quireing into natural things. Thus it Is a hard matter to find out what is produced and brought forth by VENUS, or whence VENUS has taken her beginning and original, because she is clothed to excess, with that she has no need of; and on the other side must want, that she stands in need of, as touching her fixedness. But you are to know, that VENUS is clothed with an heavenly Sulphur, which does far exceed the Splendour of the Sun, because there is found much more Sulphur in her, than in Gold. But that you may learn what the matter is of the said Sulphur of Gold, which dwells and reigns abundantly in VENUS, and of which I have spoke so much, know then, that it is likewise a flying and very hot Spirit, which can search and penetrate all, and also digest, ripen, and bring to maturity, viz., the imperfect Metal into perfect, which the unexperienced does not believe. If you ask, how the Spirit of Copper can ripen, and bring to perfection other imperfect Metals, it being itself, in its body imperfect, and"},{"pageNumber":394,"pageContent":"not fixed? I answer, as I have told already, that this Spirit cannot have or hold in Copper a fixed \"body for an habitation; therefore the habitation being burned by fire, the guest goes out of it likewise, and must leave his habitation with impatience, for he dwells therein like a hireling. But in the fixed body of Gold he has a protection, that nothing can drive him out with-out the sentence of a peculiar judge, because he has taken possess-ion of his habitation like an heir, and has taken root in that fixed body, that cannot be cast out so easily. The Tincture, which VENUS has obtained, is likewise to be found in MARS, yea, much more powerful, higher, and more excellent; for MARS is the Husband, VENUS the Wife; whereof I have spoken more at large in those writings of mine concerning them. This Tincture is likewise found in Verdigrease and Vitriol, as in a Mineral, of which a whole volume might be written: And in all these things there is found a Sulphur, which does burn, and yet another Sulphur, which does not bum, which is a wonderful work. The one is white, the other red in the operating birth: But the right and true Sulphur is incombustible: For it is a meer and true Spirit, out of which is prepared an incombustible Oil, and is indeed the Sulphur out of which the Sulphur of Gold, out of one and the same root, is made and prepared. I do discover many.secrets ,* which ought not to be done; but I. do not know how to help it. To conceal all, is like-wise a thing unanswerable, yet it is good not to do overmuch; as I have desired in that protestation of mine, not to forget my request. This Sulphur may very well be called and christened the Sulphur of the wise, because in it is found all wisdom, if you accept the Mercurial Spirit, which is to be preferred, and with it, together with the Salt of MARS must be united through a Spiritual copulation, that three may be brought to a correspondency, and be exalted into one operation. This Spiritual Sulphur does likewise and in the same manner derive its original from the Upper Region, as the Spirit of"},{"pageNumber":395,"pageContent":"Mercury does, \"but with another form and fashion, whereby the Stars do show a separation in fixed and unfixed, in tinged and not tinged things. The Tincture does consist only in the Spirit of Copper, and chiefly of its consort, and is a meer steam, stinking and of a very ill scent in the beginning: And this mist must be resolved' in a liquid manner, that the stinking incombustible Oil may be prepared out of it, which yet must have its original from MARS. This Oil is easily joined with the Spirit of Mercury, and do soon take up all metalline bodies, being first prepared according to the account given by me in my Keys. I do not keep here any order of the Planets, and that justly, not without some reason; for I do follow their generation, that is, the order and rank which I do follow because VENUS has much Sulphur, she has been together with MARS, digested and ripened sooner than any other Metals; but because they have had but little help from the inconstant Mercury, being he had no room left him to work harder, by reason of the superabundant Sulphur, they could not receive or obtain a melioration of their unfixed bodies. Now will I discover a mystery to you, that GOLD, VENUS and MARS, have in them one and the same Sulphur, one Tincture, and the same Matter of their Tincture, which Matter of the Tincture is a Spirit, a Mist, and Fume, as has been said before, which has penetrated, and does penetrate all bodies: If you can bring it into captivity, and do actuate it with the Spirit, which is found in the Salt of MARS, and then do join with the same the Spirit of Mercury, accord-ing to their weight, and do separate them from all impurity, that they become sweet, and sweet-smelling, without any corrosive, you have then a Medicine, to which nothing in the world may be com-pared; if you ferment this Medicine with the shining Sun, you have made an ingress, which is penetrant to work and to transmute all Metals. 0 Eternal Wisdom, what thanks must be rendered unto thee, for these great mysteries, which yet the children of men do not regard at all, and do scorn to enquire, and to learn what thou hast hidden"},{"pageNumber":396,"pageContent":"in Nature. They see it with their eyes, and do not know it; they hold it in their hands, and do not comprehend it; they touch and handle it, and do not know what they have, or what they make, \"because the inward part is concealed from them. I will lastly really, out of love to God, discover yet this unto you, that the root of the Philosophical Sulphur, which is an heavenly Spirit, together with the root of the Spiritual Super-natural Mercury, and the principle of the Supernatural Salt, is in one, and is found in one matter, out of which the Stone has been before me, is made, and not in many things; although the Mercury be drawn by itself by all the Philosophers, and the Sul-phur by itself, besides the Salt apart. That so Mercury is found in one, and the Sulphur in one, and the Salt in one. Notwith-standing all this, I do tell you, that this is to be understood of their superfluity, which is found most in every one, and par-ti culary in many ways may be used profitably, and prepared to a Medicine and transmutation of Metals. But the Universal, as the greatest treasure of terrestrial knowledge and wisdom, and of all the three principles, is one only thing, and is found in one only thing, and drawn out of it, which can reduce all Metals into one only thing, and is the true Spirit of Mercury, and the Soul of Sulphur joined together with the Spiritual Salt, inclosed under one heaven, and dwelling in one body, and is the Dragon and the Eagle, it is the King and the Lion, it is the Spirit and the body, which must tinge the body of Gold to be a Medicine, whereby it gets abundant power to tinge others its consorts. 0 Blessed Medicine, granted by God thy Creator! 0 heavenly Loadstone of that great attractive love! 0 bountiful substance of Metals, how great is thy power, how unsearchable is thy virtue, how stout is thy constancy?

And I am amazed myself, when I do think and consider, that I have revealed so many things; but I hope with my prayers to prevail with God, that he may not lay this to my charge as a mortal sin, because I have begun this work in his fear, have obtained it by his mercy, and have revealed it to his glory and praise. 0 most Holy and everlasting Trinity, I do give unto thee both with my heart and mouth, praise, honour, and glory, for that thou has revealed to me the great wisdom of the terrestrial world, be-sides thy Divine Word, whereby I have got the knowledge of thy Almighty power, and Supernatural miracles, which men will not acknowledge.

Concerning the generation of Copper, the reader is moreover to know and to observe, that the Copper is generated out of much Brimstone, but its Mercury and Salt are equal in the same, for"},{"pageNumber":398,"pageContent":"there is neither more nor less in quantity of one and the other to be found. Now because the Brimstone does exceed in quantity the Salt and Mercury, there arises from thence a great tinging red-ness, which great redness, has so possessed the Metal, that the Mercury could not perfect its fixedness, that a more fixed body ' might have been produced out of it. You are further to know, that the form of VENUS body is of the same condition that a tree is of, which has and does yield abundance of gum, as is the Pine and Fir-tree, with other sorts of trees more, which gum is the Sulphur of the tree, which drives out sometimes this gum at the sides of it, by reason of its too great abundance, and because it cannot harbour it all. Such a tree now, that is tinged with so much fatness by Nature, and the ripening of the Elements, burns and takes fire immediately; neither is it heavy, and is never so dur-able as Oak, and the like hardwood, which is solid and compact, and has not its pores so open, as that sort of light wood, that the Brimstone might abundantly reign in it. But therefore has the Oak-wood more Mercury, and a better Salt, than the Pine or Fir-tree. And such wood is never so much apt to swim upon the water, as the Fir-tree is, because it is close, solid, and compact, that the Air in it cannot bear it up. The same is to be understood of Metals, but especially of Gold, which, by reason of its much fixed and well ripened quick-silver, has a most solid, compact, close, fixed, and invincible body, to which neither fire or water, neither air, nor any putrifaction of the Earth can do any hurt, because its pores are closed up, and the corrupting power of the Elements cannot injure it. Which fixedness,and solid, and compact con-junction do demonstrate its natural ponderosity, which is not to be found or proved in other Metals, which may be discerned not only by weighing it in a pair of scales, but you will find it likewise, if you put but a scrupel of pure gold upon a hundred pound weight of quicksilver, it will fall presently to the bottom, whereas all other ponderous Metals, laid upon quick-silver swim"},{"pageNumber":399,"pageContent":"upon it, and do not sink to the \"bottom, because their pores are more largely extended, that the air or wind may pass through them to bear them up. Furthermore, concerning the Spirit of VENUS or Copper in Physic, you are in fine to observe, that it is found very necessary and * wholesome in its virtue and efficacy,, not only that Spirit which lies in PRIMA ENTE, but that Spirit likewise which is found in the last matter: Its virtue, power, and operation is such, that in rising of the Mother it is to be preferred before any Medicine whatsoever; as likewise against the falling sickness particularly there is nothing comparable to it. This Spirit has moreover re-ceived a singular gift to dry up the dropsie. It preserves the blood from putrifaction, and does digest everything, that might be against, or be hurtful to the stomach. It breaks the Stone, of whose nature it is. Outwardly, it lays the foundation in wounds for the cure of them. The sore called long ago NOLI ME TANGERE, and any old ulcers, be they never so deep rooted, it lays hold upon their malignity, and ushers in a ground for healing of them. Outwardly it does purifie, and searches for the certain kernel, where the cure and working Medicine may fasten, and have its beg-inning. But inwardly it searches and penetrates throughly,and finds out any malignity in the body of Man. It is like to the noblest wound-drink; there is no imposthume, but it is cured by it. To sum up all, I do say, if you have a special care of this Spirit of Copper, it will work such wonders both inwardly and outwardly, as will be accounted of all incredible and Supernatural. And thus much of the Spirit of Copper. Lastly, and to conclude all, you are to know, that the Spirit of Copper is a hot Spirit, penetrant and searching, consuming all the bad humours and phlegm, both in Men and Metals, and may be justly accounted the Crown of Physic. It Is very fiery and pierc-ing, incombustible, yet Spiritual and without form; and therefore is capable like a Spirit to further in particular the ignition, digestion, and ripening of things without form. 372."},{"pageNumber":400,"pageContent":"And if you are a true enquirer into Natures ARCANA,let this Spirit \"be recommended unto you, it will never forsake you in any nec-cessities, or wants either of health or riches, if you do exactly observe, and justly administer it.

Therefore they will whet their senses, open their eyes, and give leave to their ears, that such things may be learned out of this relation of mine, that never were ob-served, nor rightly understood before, which are found in this Spirit of Copper both inwardly and outwardly. He that will not give heed to nor observe and understand these writings of mine, has not found out many mysteries, nor enquired with constancy and truth without me, neither learned or got any profitable know-ledge. Therefore no man can pass his verdict upon me, as touching the Spirit of VENUS, except he has turned the Copper, and exactly studied all the secrets of its inward virtue, as I have done. If I can get the knowledge of anything that is better, which I am as yet ignorant of, I do most earnestly beseech you, not to con-ceal anything, and his doctrine shall be very well rewarded in a thousand ways. And thus I recommend you to the most high Creator. Reason cannot always apprehend, that which VENUS can reach unto. No thoughts can quickly find it out, and humane wit thrusts it far from itself.

MARS and VENUS have one and the same Spirit and Tincture, as the Gold and other Metals have, though this Spirit be found in"},{"pageNumber":401,"pageContent":"every Metal, in some a greater, in othersorae in smaller quantity, it is undeniable, and confessed of all, that there are divers men, and divers opinions; although men in the \"beginning are made out of one First Matter, and generated and born out of one seed, yet is there a manifold difference of their opinions, because the operation of the Stars has occasioned this, and not without a cause; for the influence of the great world works the other, (namely the difference of opinions) after itself in the little world; because all the opinions, Nature and thoughts together, with the whole complexion of Man, do derive their original only from the influence of the Stars of Heaven, and do show themselves according to the Planets and Stars, where nothing can withstand, nor obstruct such an influence, because the generation of their perfection is already performed and brought to a period or finished. For exam-ple, a man is naturally inclined to study, one has a mind for Divinity, another for the study of the Law, the third for Physic, the fourth will be a Philosopher. Besides all this, there are JJ2UJ\" have a natural inclination for Mechanic Arts; as Jl i ui that man a Tailer, another a Carver, and so forth, manilo. 5 ana innumerable. All this happens by the influence of the Stars, whereby the imagination is strengthened Supernaturally, wherein it resolves to continue. As we do find, if a man has once taken up a resolution in his mind-, and laid a foundation upon it, that no man is able to bring or keep him from it, that he should not so obstinately stand upon it, death only excepted, which at last closes up all. The same is to be understood of Chemists and Al-chemists, which having got once into the Secrets of Nature, do not intend to give them over so easily, except they have more exactly searched Nature, and wholly absolved--and finished th? study thereof, which yet is no easie matter. Thus you are like-wise to understand of Metals, that according as the infusion and imagination happens from above, so happens the form likewise; although Metals are altogether called Metals, and are indeed 37^."},{"pageNumber":402,"pageContent":"Metals, yet as you have understood \"by the divers opinions of men, which are altogether men out of one matter, there may \"be manifold and divers Metals, of which one has got an hot and dry, another a cold and moist, another a mixed complexion and nature. There-fore, \"because the Metal of MARS has before others been ordered by a gross Salt in the greatest quantity in its degree, its body is the hardest, most inflexible, strongest, and coursest, which Nature has thus granted and appropriated to it. It contains the least part of Mercury, a little more it has of Sulphur, but the greatest part of Salt: And from this mixture is sprung its corporeal being, and is thus bom into the world, with the help of the Elements. Its Spirit is in operation equal to other Spirits: But if the true and right Spirit of Iron can be discerned, I do really, and not unwisely tell you, that one grain of its Spirit or quintessence, taken and administered in Spirit of wine, comforts and strengthens a mans heart, mind, and courage, so that no fear of any of his enemies may be perceived: It stirs up a lion like heart within him, and does inflame to begin and consummate a fight with VENUS. If the conjunction of MARS and VENUS does rightly happen in a certain constellation, they have success, victory, and conquest, both in love and sorrow, in fights and peace, and will continue of one mind, though the whole world should bear a spleen and enmity against them. But because I am an Ecclesiastical man, I have subjected myself to Spirituality, and have recommended my Soul to God, without enticing of humane concupisence, and allurements of the lust of the flesh, which being unpermitted, prepare a way to Hell; but Gods command, fear, and permission of the will of men, licenced by his command, make the way ready for Heaven, if they do perservere in the true worship of, and the true lively faith in the Throne of Grace, the Mediator and Intercessor Jesus Christ our Saviour, This Spirit cures, dispells and heals wonderfully all Martial distempers, as the Dysentery or Bloody-flux, the courses of women, white and red, any loosness and open sores in the legs, bones, and whole body,"},{"pageNumber":403,"pageContent":"together with all such distempers both inward and outward, by what name soever they may be called, as are occasioned by bloody-MARS, the names whereof I shall forbear to recite, because these dis-tempers and diseases, which are subject to MARS and under his jurisdiction, are confessed by and known to experienced and skill-ful physicans. This Spirit of Iron being rightly discerned and known, has a secret affinity with the Spirit of Copper, that they may be so joined together, that there rises one only matter from them, of one and the same operation, form, substance, and being, which will cure and relieve the same distempers, and transmute the particularities of Metals with profit and honour. But Iron together with its virtue ought properly to be considered in the manner following, that it has a terrestrial body only in its cor-poreal form, which body may be used to a great many things, to alter the blood, to outward wounds, to a graduation of Silver, and in-wardly to the constipation of the body; which yet is not always beneficial to use, neither in a mans body inwardly and outwardly, nor yet as concerning Metals. Because there is no great advantage to be made PER SE without the known right means, which do belong to Natures Secret Knowledge. I must remember one thing more, that the Lodestone and the true Iron are almost of one and the same use in bodily distempers, and-are almost of one and the same Nature, even as it is according to a Divine, Spiritual, and Elemential sense, betwixt the body, its Soul, and the Chaos, out of which the Soul and Spirit are gone, the body is framed last of all out of that composition. What shall we do now, the ignorant and rude will not apprehend it, those as understand something will take notice of my writings, and those Nature surpassing wits will find fault. Here I do want some advice, for I would fain find out a way, that all these mighty wise men might continue my friends: Which I shall declare to you thus, that, because the argument itself does declare and pronounce the sentence and conclusion, there the resolution remains open, and cannot come further under any judge-ment of the mind, but must be declared, resolved, retained, and signified by itself. 376."},{"pageNumber":404,"pageContent":"Finally, observe this in this Chapter, that no House-keeping can \"be rightly and Constantly performed betwixt a married couple, where one party will turn and drive the Chariot towards the East, the other towards the West: For they possible cannot draw after this fashion, the said Chariot in an equal poise, whence there arises a great dissension and hinderance to obtain that which they imag-ined. But if such married persons do intend to govern their house well, they must be of one Spirit, one opinion, one mind, and vir-tue to perform and to act all, that is in their hearts and minds to work one with the other, if so be their love and faithfulness is perfect. For want of one of these parts, the three principles are not rightly together. For Mercury is full of cowardise, and too little, as concerning constancy and fixedness. Sulphur is too little, it cannot heat the body of love, it being too much quinched. And the Salt has not its due, fit, and natural kind neither, but is too hard, and too much, and therefore is the cause of a hard coagulation, is sharp and fretting, and does not show itself by fidelity and constancy. This is the course of this world, and the world is big of this vice, for there is but little constancy, small love, and less fidelity. This Philosophical example, I hope, will not be misconstrued, because SYRACH extolls and dispraises the faithfullness and malice of a false woman, and both in a different manner. With this I bid MARS farewell, because no man knows to distinguish things of one and the same nature, much less such as are of a different, but he that has thus observed them, and has made a strict enquireing into their nature and properties, and by such accurate enquires has found them out and learned them.

The brightness of Heaven has now commanded, me to change my pen, to discover a thing of fortitude and of constancy, because the Sun is a burning consuming fire, hot and dry, wherein there is a true power of all natural things, which power of the Sun works wisdom, riches, and health. My heart is seized upon by sorrow, and my Spirit within itself becomes astonished, to manifest and to bring to light such things, as have not been discovered and commonly laid open before me, and to reveal that which has been buried in the depth with the very great secrecy. Notwithstanding, if I do go into myself, and examine my conscience, I could not find any other alteration to turn my mind, and to bring it upon some other design, which might obstruct my former resolution, but I shall speak with discretion, and write with prudence, that no evil may be occasioned by it, but rather some grateful good ob-tained, which I have delivered in the same manner, as other Philo-sophers have done before me. Observe well, and having fixed your thoughts, put aside all these strange things, which are not ser-viceable to your speculation of Philosophy, but rather do destroy that advantage, which you have so earnestly sought for. Know then, that if you do earnestly long for, and heartily desire to get this golden Load-stone, your prayers first of all must be rightly made to God, in true knowledge, contrition, sorrow, and true humility, for to know and to learn the three different worlds, wherein the immortal Soul keeps its seat and residence, besides its first original, and is by Gods creation the first moving sensibility, or the first moving sensible Soul, which of a Super-natural being has wrought a natural life; and this Soul, and this Spirit, is the root, and the first fountain, and the first creature existing in the life of anything, and the PRIMUM MOBILE, which"},{"pageNumber":406,"pageContent":"has been controverted so much by learned and very wise men. Furthermore, observe likewise the second Celestial World, and take very good notice of it, for therein do reign the Planets, and all heavenly Stars have their course, virtue, and power in this heaven, and do perform therein their service by their Spirit, both Minerals and Metals. Out of these two worlds arises another different world, wherein is found and comprehended, what the other two worlds have wrought and produced, out of the first Supercelestial World is derived the fountain of life, and of the Soul: From the second Celestial World does spring the light of the Spirit; fna from the third, the Elemental World, comes the invincible, heavenly, yet sensible fire, by which is digested and is ripened that which is compre-hended. These three matters and substances do generate and bring forth the form of Metals, amongst which Gold has the pre-eminency, because the Siderial and Elemental operation has mellowed and ripened the Mercurity in this Metal the more substantially, to a sufficient and perfect maturity. And as the seeds of a man does fall into the womb, and touches the MENSTRUUM, which is its earth, but the seed, which goes out of the Man into the Woman, is wrought in both the Stars and Elements, that it may be united and nourished by the Earth to a generation: So you are likewise to understand, that the Soul of Metals, which is conceived by an unperceiveable, invisible, incomprehensible, abstruse, and Supernatural Celestial composition, as out of Water and Air, which are formed out of the Chaos, and then further digested and ripened by that heavenly Elemental light and fire of the Sun, whereby the Stars do move the Powers, when its heat in the inward parts of the Earth, as in the womb is perceived: For by the warming property of the Stars above, the Earth is unlocked and opened, that the infused Spirit of the same may yield food and nourishment, and be enabled to generate something, as Metals, Herbs, Trees, and Beasts, where every one particularly brings with it its seed for a further mul-tiplication and augmentation. And as the conception of a man is"},{"pageNumber":407,"pageContent":"Spiritual and heavenly, whose Soul and Spirit by nourishment of the Earth in the mothers womb, are formally brought up to a per-fection: So likewise it is to be observed and understood in every particular of Metals and Minerals. But this is the true Secret of Gold, viz., to instruct and teach you by an example and sililitudS, whereby the possibility of Nature, and its mystery is to be found in the manner following. It is probably true, that the heavenly light of the Sun is of a fiery property, and of a fiery being, which the most high God, as Creator of Heaven and Earth has granted to it, through an heavenly, constant, and fixed Sulphureous Spirit, for the preservation of its substance, form, and body; which creat-ure by reason of its swift motion and course, through its swiftness is inflamed, and set on fire by the air; which inflamation will never be extinguished, as long as the motion does last, and the whole created visible world does continue and endure, nor in the least diminished in its power: Because there is no combustible matter exstant, which might be given to it, whose consumption might cause the decay of that great light of Heaven. So is Gold by the Superior of its Essence thus digested and ripened, and is become of such a fixed invincible nature, that nothing at all can hurt it; because the upper fixed Stars have penetrated the lower, that the lower fixed Stars, by reason of the infusion and grant of the upper, need not to give place to their equal; because the lower has received and obtained such a constant fixedness from the upper. This now is very well to be noted and observed, as con-cerning the first matter of Gold. I must alledge yet another similitude according to the manner of Philosophers, of the great light of Heaven, and of that small fire, which being terrestrial is here kindled every day, and is made to burn before our eyes. Because that great light has a magnetical likeness, and an attractive loving power with that small fire here upon earth, which yet is without form and impalpable, and found only Spiritual, invisible, insensible, and incomprehensible. It is remarkable, as it is proved and demonstrated by experience, 380."},{"pageNumber":408,"pageContent":"that that great light of heaven has a great love for, and bears an affection and inclination to the little fire, which is terrestrial, by reason of the Spiritual Air, whereby both are agitated, and preserved from their utter ruin and destruction. For do but con-sider, as soon as the Air, through great moisture or humidity, which it has attracted and taken in, conceives any corruption, that so through mists, and further coagulation and conjunction, clouds are generated, the beams of the Sun are hindered and ob-structed, that the Sun cannot obtain its reflexion, nor have its due penetrating and searching powers So likewise this little terr-estrial fire does never burn so clear in dark, cloudy, and rainy weather, neither does it show itself with that gladness in its operation, as when the air is fair, pure, clear, and unmixed, and heavenly. The cause is this, for through the obstacle of the moist air, the love is hindered and obstructed, that the attractive power growing sad, cannot exercise its perfect love and operation, as it ought to do, for the contrary element, the aquosity, causes this obstruction. As now the Sun, that heavenly great light, has a special communion and love with the small terrestrial fire, to attract after a magnetical manner: So likewise has the Sun and gold a special correspondency, and a peculiar attractive power and love together, because the Sun has wrought the Gold through the three principles, have their Lode-stone, which is nearest of all related to the Sun, and has attained to the highest degree, so that the three Principles are found most mighty and powerful in the same. Next to it is Gold in its corporeal form, because it is framed out of the three Principles, but has its original and beginning from the heavenly and golden Load-stones. This is the greatest wisdom beyond all wisdom nay, a wisdom beyond all humane reason and understanding. For by this wisdom is first of all apprehended the Creation, the heavenly Essence, the operation of the firmament, the Spiritual imagination, and corporeal being, and does comprehend all the qualities and properties, and whatsoever 381."},{"pageNumber":409,"pageContent":"does maintain and preserve a man. In this golden Loadstone is and lies \"buried the dissolution and opening of all the Minerals and Metals, their government, as also their matter of the first generation, and their power, as touching health. Moreover the coagulation and fixation of Metals, together with the operation ' to cure all diseases. Take a special care of this Key, for it is heavenly, Sideral, and elemental, out of which the terrestrial is generated. It is Supernatural and Natural together, and is born out of the Spirit of Mercury, heavenly; out of the Spirit of Sul-phur, Spiritual; but out of the Spirit of Salt, corporeal. This is the whole way, and the whole substance, the \"beginning, and the end. For the Spirit and body are so knit together in one by the Soul, that they can never be separated, but do generate a most perfect and fixed body, which can receive no hurt. Out of this Spiritual Essence, and out of this Spiritual matter, out of which the Gold first of all is made corporeal into one body, is the Potable Gold more substantially to be made, then out of Gold itself, which must be made Spiritual, before the Potable Gold can be prepared out of it. This Spirit cures likewise the Leprosie, the French-pox, as being a Superfixed Mercurial Essence, drys up and consumes the Dropsie, and all running open sores, which have affleeted a long time, comforts the Heart and brain, stren-gthens the memory, breeds good blood, and causes gladness and desire, and natural inticement to Carnal Copulation. If you mix the Quintessence of Pearls with the Tincture of Corals,and do administer and join them with it, the same quantity of this Spirit-ual Essence of Gold, the quantity of two grains, you may assure yourself, and boldly rely upon it, that no natural distemper can trouble you, or do you any hurt to endanger your health. Because the nature of the Spirit of Gold is to change and alter all in-firmities, to take them away, and to cure them, that so the body may become perfect without any distemper. The Quintessence of Pearls does comfort the heart, strengthening the memory and senses. The Tincture of Corals dispells all poison together with the evil Spirits, which do abhor that which is good. 382."},{"pageNumber":410,"pageContent":"Thus can the Soul of Gold reduced into water, the Spiritual essence of Pearls, and the Sulphur of Corals united in one do such things, which to Nature seem otherwise incredible. But be-cause experience does confirm the infallible truth, it is then deservedly a cordial in this mortal life, and is justly, by reason of its wonderful effects, preferred before all the cordials, by what names soever they may be called. I am a Spiritual man, sub-ject to the Ecclesiastical State, and engaged by a Spiritual and Divine Oath to the Order of the Benedict, whereby through my devout prayers I do receive great and precious promises of the Word of God, to the comfort of my Soul: But in corporeal afflections of my infirmity, as well as of my breathren, I have not found nor used a greater cordial by Gods blessing, than this composition of the three things aforesaid.

And thus much may suffice for the present for the dis-covery of the Spirit of Gold, till the coming again of ELIAS. To this I will add yet this short process. Take Spirit of Salt, and with it extract the Sulphur of Gold. Separate the Oil of Salt from it, and rectifie the Sulphur of Gold with Spirit of wine, that it may become pleasant, without any corrosiveness. Then take the true Oil of Vitriol, made out of the Vitriol of Verdigreese, dissolve it in iron; Make again a Vitriol out of it, and dissolve it again into an Oil or Spirit, which rectifie likewise as before, with Spirit of wine. Put them together, and draw off the Spirit of wine from thence. Dissolve the matter, which remains dry behind, in the Spirit of Mercury, in a due proportion or weight. Circulate and coagulate it.

OF THE TINCTURE OF SILVER.

In what manner Metals do obtain their tinging Spirits and coagulation; in the same manner have the stones likewise received their hardness, fixedness, and Tincture, as by one and the same influence.

You will say, my speech is too dark for you: If so, kindle then that terrestrial fire, and search and be not ashamed, to make friendship with Vul-can; let no painstaking discourage you, and you will find by the permission of the Eternal God, that the Spirit of Silver all alone contains that, which will perfectly cure and dispell the Dropsie: Even as the Spirit of Gold, and of Mercury, can radically, cure the Consumption, so that even the center itself of the said dis-temper may not be found. But that Silver is not so provided in its degree with a hot substance and quality, in the veins of the Earth, but is subjected to a waterish kind; this fault is to be laid upon the great light of heaven, which by reason of its waterish influence has planted this quality into the second creature and into the second planet of the Earth, as unto Silver.

Therefore I will propose unto you an example, and instruct you \"by a country rule, what you are to apprehend and to consider from childrens play, to things of great concernment, that you may advantagiously enquire into, and meditate upon them, viz., a common countryman sows linseed upon a. well dunged, and well tilled ground, which linseed comes forth out of the earth after its putrefaction, \"by the operation and furtherance of the Elements, and lays \"before our eyes a matter of flax together with its seed, which it brings increased with it, which flax is plucked off and separated from its seed. This flax cannot be used, nor prepared with any profit for any work, except it be first of all putrefied through water, by which putrefaction the body unlocks itself, and gains an ingress of its usefulness. After this putrefaction and unlocking is performed, the flax is dried again by the air and the sun, and through the coagulation reduced and brought again to a formal being, that it may further serve for work. This prepared flax is washed, beaten, broken, and swinged, last of all heckled, that the PURUM AB IMPURO, the clean from the unclean, the gross from that which is subtil may be separated, which otherwise is impossible to be done and per-formed, except the aforesaid preparation go before. Afterwards they spin this flax, and it becomes yarn. This yarn is boiled in water upon the fire, or laid into lees and placed by the fire, whereby a new purification happens, that so the impurity and super-fluous uncleanness may be further severed and separated. After the yarn is rightly washed and cleansed, it is dried, ana carried to a Weaver, and cloth made of it; which cloth by often wetting with water is clarified and whitened, cut in pieces by Taylors, and other people, and used according to every house-keepers nec-essity. And after such linen cloth is torn and worn to pieces, and as it were reduced to nothing, then are the old rags picked, and gathered, and carried to a paper-mill, where the Master makes paper out of them, which may likewise be used for several things. This paper being laid upon some Metal or Glass, and then lighted 386."},{"pageNumber":414,"pageContent":"and burnt, the Vegetable Mercury goes then out of the paper into the Air, and flys away. The Salt remains in the ashes, and the burning Sulphur, that which is not so quickly consumed in the burn-ing, is resolved into an Oil, which is an excellent Medicine for dark and bad eyes. This resolved Oil has in it an extraordinary fatness, which the matter of the paper has carried with it from the beginning of its first seed of flax: And thus the last matter flax, as paper, is again resolved into the first matter, as the fat sulphureous oleosity of the linseed, together with a sep-aration of its Mercury and Salt; that so out of the last, the first as the foundation, is made manifest, and out of the first the virtue and operation is known and learned. Though this argument be rude and gross, yet will you learn by it things secret and subtil. For that which is subtil, must be infused under gross examples into ignorant people: For they are to learn, to put off that which is gross, and to take in that which is subtil. Thus you are likewise to understand, that the first matter of Metals must be observed, studied, and found out, through the discovery of their last matter, which last matter, as there are the absolute and perfect Metals, must be divided and separated, that it may appear altogether naked to a mans eyes, and then there may be learned & known by such a division, what the first matter has been in the beginning, out of which the last is made. Thus much concerning Silver. I had several things yet to mention, but I will leave them for another time: Most heartily beseeching you, and exhorting you upon your conscience, that you will observe all these things which I have discovered unto you, and all these letters which are comprehended betwixt ALPHA and OMEGA, and care-fully keep all my sayings and writings, that you may ncu crave pardon for your sins, and suffer everlasting vengence to eternity. Lastly, I do impart this yet unto you. Take the sky-coloured Sulphur of Silver, which has been extracted out of Silver, and rectified by Spirit of wine. Dissolve it according to its weight 387."},{"pageNumber":415,"pageContent":"in the white Spirit of Vitriol,and in the sweet scented Spirit of Mercury, and coagulate them together through a fixation of fire, and you will get the possession of the white Tincture, and its Medicine.

The \"benign JUPITER is almost of a middle nature amongst all the Metals. He is neither too hot, nor yet too cold, not too warm, nor too moist. He has not too much Mercury, nor yet of Salt, and of Sulphur there is least of all in him. Pewter is found white in its colour; yet of these three principles one does exceed the other, as it has \"been clearly discovered in its division, accord-to the true enquiry into natures secrets. Out of this composition and mixture of the three principles, is generated, and wrought, and coagulated into a Metal, and brought to a maturity of per-fection, JUPITER a God of peace, a bountiful Governor, and a Lord and Prince of the middle region, as concerning his estate, essence, profession, virtue, form and substance; for he keeps the mean, and there can hardly happen'any distemper, where JUPITER may do any extraordinary hurt, if his Medicine be soberly used in not too great a quantity. It is likewise reputed needless, where his Medicine is not required, to administer it, not being called for, to strange things; but is justly reserved for these where the body and distemper have a similitude of likeness with the upper stars, and their help in virtue, power, and operation, and so agree together in their conjunction, that there may not be found any contrariety, neither in the operation, nor in the operating nature. The Spirit of JUPITER is found such; that it may in no"},{"pageNumber":416,"pageContent":"wise be spared in the generation of Metals, as likewise no Spirit of any Metals may be put by, because they must needs concord and agree from the lowest to the highest degree, if there shall follow a perfect metal in the earth, and likewise in the little world by transmutation and augmentation. This is now to be understood ' thus, that all degrees, from the lowest Metal to the Highest in perfection, must be gone through; as likewise the Metals must perform their course from the very lead to Gold, by reason of the fixedness of the tincture and body, notwithstanding that SATURN keeps the chiefest place in the highest region, wherein the ASTRA do reign, and the Stars do perform their motion. The generation of PEWTER in and above the Earth, is brought to light after the following manner. As a man, and other beasts are first brought up and fed with the milk of their mother, and there is no meat to be found upon the face of the Earth, more convenient and fit for the bringing up of men than milk; for their melioration is for the most part by an animal Sulphur, which yields the nourishment. Thus likewise is PEWTER fed and brought up by its metalline Sul-phur, which is most agreeable to it, and sucks in more warmth and heat than Saturn, and therefore is Jupiter the more digested and roasted, whereby also his body becomes more constant and fixed in the degree of Salt. JUPITER orders that his Lordship and Dominions may be well gover-ned, and justice be rightly administered to everyone in his Court of \"Judicature. The Spirit of JUPITER does protect and preserve from all distempers and diseases incident and hurtful to the Liver. Its Spirit is naturally, as for its taste, like unto honey. Its Mercury being made volatile, does get a venomous quality, for it purges vehemently, and penetrates with violence. Therefore it is not always good, that its unlocked Quick-silver should be thus simply used by itself; but if a correction goes before, it may be very well used with exceeding great usefulness in those distempers and diseases, which are immediately subject to his influence; that is to say, when you have taken away from CEDEKIEL its venemous 389."},{"pageNumber":417,"pageContent":"wise \"be spared in the generation of Metals, as likewise no Spirit of any Metals may be put by, because they must needs concord and agree from the lowest to the highest degree, if there shall follow a perfect metal in the earth, and likewise in the little world by transmutation and augmentation.

I do not speak now after my poetical manner, nor do I write in that style, which I have used in discovery of that miraculous nativity of the seven planets in my OCCULTA PHILOSOPHIA; neither do I make use of a magical or cabillistical manner; much less do I observe the method of these, which have industriously studied and learned the secret, hidden, and supernatural Arts, as there are HYDROMANTIA, AEROMANTIA, GEOMANTIA, PYROMANTIA, NIGROMANTIA, and the like: But my purpose and intention for the present is to discover the Secrets of Nature, that the lovers of Art, and child-ren of this searching and desired wisdom, may, by the blessing, mercy, and permission of God, apprehend, observe, and study them, and after diligent observation may learn and keep some useful things, as well concerning the generation of Metals in two parts, in the greater and lesser world, as also the true Medicine, which these metallic and mineral forms do contain in their inward parts, which are apprehended and demonstratsd \"by dividing» that their first beginning is notoriously manifested in three several things.

I will stick to the things I have experience of, and which are practised by my fellow physicians; thus shall I continue undeciev-ed, and I do assuredly know, that I need not take any pains for to learn novelties. He that is of such a resolution, will certainly abide with his Ducks, and never deserve roasted Geese, to learn the Secrets of Nature. But I do sincerly confess, and call the most High Trinity to witness, under the loss of the noblest Spiritual Jewel, that what-soever I have written, and shall yet write here, is truth, and will be found to be nothing else but the truth. But that every understanding, and every common man, but especially those that are haters and persecutors of these Secrets, do not understand my writings so well and so clearly, this, I say, I cannot help. Pray you to God for his grace, and you persecutors ask him for-giveness, work cheerfully, and use your reason when you read, and there will be no secret so abstruse for you, but you will by en-quiry find it out. Moreover, I do exhort you, that whosoever finds out this gift of God, may without intermission, day and night, offer most hearty thanks with all humility, and reverence, and due obedience to God the Creator chiefly; because no Creature is capable to render sufficient thanks, which might equilize this benefit: Therefore diligence is to be known by a true and real industry, according to ones power. I have done my due, for which I intend to answer to God and the world, for what these eyes of mine have seen, my hands have felt, and myself with reason in-fallibly comprehended, shall no body take away from me in this life, death excepted, which does separate all things. I have not indeed been forced to write these things, but what-soever I have done, I have neither done out of rashness, nor yet out of a desire to get to myself a temporal lasting name; but I have been put upon it by the command of Christ the Lord, that his majesty and mercy, in Eternal and Temporal things, may not be hid"},{"pageNumber":420,"pageContent":"from any man, but may be manifested to the praise, honour, and glory of his holy and everlasting Name, that it may be, by reason of its omnipotency, confirmed by the performing of great miracles, magnified, acknowledged, and in its majesty exalted. The Second thing that moved me to write this, was Christian charity to my neighbour, to do him as much good as to myself, and thereby to heap fiery coals upon the heads of mine enemies. And lastly, that all my adversaries likewise might acknowledge, what errors or by paths others had been in, in comparision to me, and who had most faithfully discovered Nature's ARCANA, whether I am to be condemned, or they be justified. And then last of all, that the highest mystery might not be altogether choaked in dark-ness, nor overwhelmed by the swelling waters, but being freed from the miry and filthy ditches of a simple and ignorant crew, might get many witnesses, by spreading abroad of a true, certain, and due acknowledgement, to follow my footsteps in discovering the truth. They attribute to me in my Lordship, of the 12 Signs of the Stars of Heaven, the Archer and Fishes, out of these I am born, because I was in an aquosity before I began to live; but the Archer has fixed his arrow into my heart, that I having lost this aquosity of mine, was made worthy of the dry earth; And though the earth was brought into a soft substance by the water, yet are you to know, that the water was consumed through the dry and warm air, and so all the soft matter of the earth being vanished, I was made worthy to receive that hardness by the aforesaid exsiccation. By this, as well the schollar as the wise man, are to take good notice and diligently to observe, that JUPITER, as well as other the chiefest planets, is subject to the four Elements, which Elements have received their Centrum from above, and are born as others are. To conclude all, I will let you know, that if you do extract out of the benigne JUPITER his Salt and Sulphur, and make Saturn flow very well together with them, Saturn does get a fixed body, is purified, and becomes clear by them, and is a total change,"},{"pageNumber":421,"pageContent":"and real transmutation of Lead into good Pewter, as you will find it upon a most accurate trial. And although this may seem to you not to be true, yet are you to understand, that by reason that the Salt of JUPITER is made more corporeal only by its Sulphur, it likewise has received an efficacy and a power to penetrate SATURN, as the vilest and most volatile metal and to bring it to its own substance by making it better, as you will really find it to be so. CHAPTER IX. OF THE SPIRIT OF SATURN OR TINCTURE OF LEAD. SATURN to generate his metal, which is Lead, is placed in the upper Heaven above all Stars. But in the lower parts of the earth he does keep the lowest degree. As the uppermost light of SATURN is mounted to the highest altitude of all the lights of Heaven; so likewise in imitation of the same, has Nature given leave and permitted, that his children of the lower Region have retired themselves by VULCAN to those of their quality, according as SATURN has been moved. For the upper light is the cause of it, and has generated an unfixed body of Lead, through which go and are drawn open pores, that the air can have its passage through this Saturnine body, and bear it up. But the fire easily works upon and consumes it, because the body is not solid and compact by reason of its unfixedness. This is well to be observed by a serious enquirer into all things; because there is a vast differ-ence betwixt fixt and unfixt bodies, and then the fixedness and unfixedness: And though SATURN is of a singular ponderosity before other metals; yet will you observe, that when they are poured out together, after their conjunction in the melting of them, the other metals will always fall to the bottom, as likewise it happens"},{"pageNumber":422,"pageContent":"with other metals, \"by pouring them through Antimony. Whereby it does appear, that other metals have a more solid and compact body, then SATURN can raise; because it must give place to other metals, make room for them, and yield the victory: For it vanishes away, and is consumed together with those unconstant and unfixed metals'. For there are the three grossest qualities of the three principles in SATURN, and by reason that its Salt is altogether fluid in comparision to other metals and planets, therefore is likewise its body more fluid, inconstant, unfixed, and more volatile, than any metallic body. How SATURN does proceed towards his regeneration, you are to know, that as common water through natural cold, by the alterat-ion of the upper heaven is congealed, so that it becomes a coagulat-ed ice: So likewise it is demonstrated, that Lead is coagulated and made corporeal by reason of the great cold, which is found in its Salt before any other Salt. The congealed ice is resolved through warmth, and so is the coagulated Lead made fluid by fire. It has most Mercury in it, yet inconstant and volatile: But less of Sulphur; and therefore according to the small quantity of the same, its cold body cannot be heated; and least of all of Salt, but fluid: Otherwise the iron would be more liquid and malleable than SATURN, if the Salt alone could impart both the malleableness and fluidity, because iron does carry with it more Salt than any other metal. And being there is a difference to be found in these things, you must carefully observe how metals are to be distinguished. All the Philosophers indeed, besides myself, have written, that the Salt causes the coagulation, and the body of every metal: And this is true, but I shall let you see by an example, how this is to be understood. ALUMEN PLUMOSUM is reputed and probably account-ed to be a meer•Salt, and herein may be compared to iron, which Salt is the aforesaid ALUMEN PLUMOSUM is nevertheless found to be as a matter, and not liquid like iron. Oh the contrary, Vitriol does show itself like Salt in a small quantity, yet liquid and open; and therefore its Salt cannot cause so hard a coagulation in 39^."},{"pageNumber":423,"pageContent":"its appropriated metal, as that other Salt does. Although all the Salts of Metals are grown out of one root, and one seed, yet is there a difference of their three principles to be observed: As one herb differs from the other, and like wise in Men and other Beasts a difference is found as concerning the original of their qualities, and their three principles, where one herb has some-thing more of this, another herb more of that kind; which is like-wise to be understood of Men and Beasts. The Soul of Lead is of a sweet quality, as also the Soul of JUPITER, and yet sweeter, so that as for sweetness there is hardly anything comparable to it, being first purified by separation, that the pure being very well severed from the impure, there may follow a compleat perfection in the operation. Otherwise the Spirit of Lead is naturally cold and dry, therefore I do advise both Men and Women not to make too much use of it, for it over-cools Humane Nature, that their seed cannot perfect or perform its natural operation; nor is it good for the spleen and bladder, it does attract the phlegmatic quality, which breeds melancholy in men. For SATURN is a Governour, and such a melancholy one, whereby a man is upheld and strengthened in his melancholy: Therefore if its Spirit be used, one melancholy Spirit does attract the other, whereby a mans body is freed and released from its infused melancholy. Outwardly-is the Soul of SATURN very wholesome in all sores and wounds, whether they be old or green, whether they happen by thrusting or cutting, or naturally by means incident, so that hardly any other metal will do the like. It is a cooling thing in all hot and swelled members; but to eat away, and to lay a foundation for healing in all corrupt and putrified sores, which have their issuing forth from within, there the noble VENUS has the pre-emenency; because copper is hot in its Essence to exsiccate and dry up, but Lead on the contrary is found to be cold in its Essence. That heavenly light of the Sun is much hotter than the light of the Moon, because the Moon is much lesser than the Sun, which does comprehend the eighth part of magnitude in the circle of"},{"pageNumber":424,"pageContent":"measuring and dividing. And if the Moon should exceed the Sun in this magnitude of the eighth part, as the Sun does exceed the Moon; then all the fruit, and whatsoever grows upon the earth would \"be spoiled, and there would \"be a continual winter, and no summer would \"be found. But the eternal Creator has herein wisely-prescribed a certain order and law to his Creatures, that the Sun should give light by day, and the Moon by night, and thus be serviceable to all creatures. Those children which are addicted to the influence of SATURN are melancholy, surly, always murmuring, like old covetious misers, which do no good to their own bodies, and are never satisfied; they use their bodies to hard labour, vex and fret themselves with troublesome thoughts, and are very seldome so cheerful as to recreate themselves with other people, neither do they care much for natural love of handsome and beautiful women. To sum up all, I do tell you, that SATURN is generated out of little Sulphur, little Salt, and much immature and gross Mercury; which Mercury is to be accounted like skum or froth, which swims upon the water, in comparision to that Mercury which is found in Gold, being of a much hotter degree. Hence it is, that the Mercury of SATURN has not so fresh and so running a life, as that which is made out of Gold, because more heat is found in this, to which the running life owes its original, therefore it is likewise to be observed in the inferiour world of the Little VULCAN, in the augmentation and transmutation of metals, what description I have given you of these three principles of SATURN, concerning their original, quality, and complexion. And everyone is to know, that no transmutation of any metal can arise from SATURN, by reason of its great cold, except the coagulation of Mercury: Because the cold Sulphur of Lead can quench and take away the hot running Spirit of Quick-Silver, if the process be rightly performed; therefore it is rightly to be observed, that the method be so kept, that the throry may agree with the practice, and concur in a certain measure and concord. Wherefore you must 396."},{"pageNumber":425,"pageContent":"not altogether reject SATURN, nor vilify and disparage it; for its nature and virtue is not as yet known \"but to few. For the Stone of the Philosophers has the first \"beginning of its heavenly resplendent tincture only from the metal, and by infusion of this planet, is the key of fixedness delivered to it through putrefact-ion; because that out of the yellow there cannot come any red thing, except there be first made out of the beginning of the black a white one.
