Courteous Reader,"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"I Have carefully, though not curiously, dis|robed that worthy Knight, and excellent Doctor in Physick and Chirurgery, Le|onard Phioravant out of his Italian Vesture, and put him into our English habit, that such an excellent Piece may not lye cloystered in the Precinct of one Principality, but that our own Na|tion may participate of the Honie, this Laborious Bee hath brought to his Hive: If all relish not at the first gust, the fault is not in the Work, but their judge|ments that understand him not, nor the jewels presen|ted unto them. Avicen King of Arabia in the A|rabick, Hippocrates and Galen in Greek, and Pli|nie and Celsus in Latine; besides many English and French, have testified their love to their native Countries, by publishing in their own Languages such rare Treasures as these. Nor fear I detraction from any for these my Labours, unlesse it be from some run|nagate Varlets, that carry all their cunning in a Chi|rurgians Box in their Pockets, and their learning in a Cap-case behind at their backs; who through Igno|rance, neither regarding the quantity, nor quality of those excellent Medicines, abuse, and sophisticate them in making them up, but this must be obtruded unto the Men, not the Medicines; for prevention whereof here|after, that honourable Society of London Physitians have chose out a Chymick Artificer, whom they have placed in their own Colledge, and over whom they have set discreet, and learned overseers to oblige the publike for their care to their Medicines hereafter.

To the Reader. HAving taken upon me to write a breif Treatise of Chi|rurgery, in the which I will write the meer verity, and that with as much brevity as may be, because the truth useth but little room, for the Philospher writeth, that the truth is such a light as all men doe hide, covering it with divers a|buses, as the Poets many times doe; for when they write one of their tales, they goe about to hide it, and thus to our purpose: Those that write great volumes cannot choose many times but hide the truth; for in much matter there entereth both good and bad, and therefore I will write no more then is necessary, declaring what Chirurgery is, and in what order it should be used with all his accidents, shewing what Wounds are, with Imposthumes and Ulcers, how they ingender, and when they are ingendered, how to cure them and dissolve them: A discourse which will please many, because it is onely truth, and of great importance: Let every one therefore know, that Science with experience doe appear to be one thing, and at this present every one is certain thereof, that the experience of Physick as well as of Chirurge|ry, cannot be good without Science or Method, as a man may term it; but I say, that Experience is better then Science in these two Arts, that is, in Physick and Chirurgery, for Science onely sheweth the vertue, the which may be done with Practise that hath no Theorick; of which I have written sufficiently in my Caprici Medicinale, and that this which I write is truth, I will prove it, for I say, that none can help with the onely Method, but alwayes it is necessary, that there be some experience or practise, therefore those that doe delight to un|derstand, let them follow this my short Treatise, in the which I will treat of things most necessary to be known, and will shew how easie it is to work in that Art, declaring all the difficult matter, so that every one may see and perceive it plain, and afterwards I will shew how to make many new Medicines, as well for Wounds, as for the other sorts of sores, which have not been used neither of old Doctors nor of new; the which Remedies are of such vertue and strength, that the world will wonder at them for their notable quick working, and hereafter I will write what Chirurgery is.

FINIS. 1 Short Amimadversions upon the Book lately Published by one who stiles himselfe NOAH BIGGS, Helmontii Psittacum. Friend, YOu set a bigg Saile to a little Vessell: I beleeve your Arke doth not like Noah's, containe all the vitality of Rationals, and Sensibles. You write Pag. 205. con|cerning Mastication. See|ing all Aliment ought to passe into a liquid Re|duction, or tendance to Chilificative mutation, or Alimentall conversion, therefore Mastificati|on is to be highly commended. You have like the great Fish, that swallowed Ionah, received in Van Helmont, though not di|gested him; and the same taxe may passe on you, which somtimes did on a Noble Courtier, de|vorasti, non edisti. It was the judgment of 2 Doctor Charlton; a Learned Physitian, a favourer of Van Helmont, that he had a better Faculty, Ever|tere opiniones Veterum, quam extruere, & stabilire Novas. When was ever Practice amongst the Physiti|ans so narrowly confined, as they kept themselves to one Author? Do not some of them follow Minfect, others Hartman, others Grulingius, others will have their prescriptions made after Querce|tan, Faber, or Poterius, some after Begvinus, Millius, Billich, Burgravius, Becherus, or other Authors; And some disgust all, which are not Paracelsian, or accord with Basilius, Valentinus his Master, and are pleased to practise after their Medicines, with the additions of their own Experiments, out of their reading, and judegment on their severall Authors. I would gladly know who ties himselfe to Sennertus, Riverius, or any one Mo|dern Author, as if universall Learning were contained in the sphere of one Microcosme: Yet you are so much for Helmont, as if he were the great Luminary of the World. I confesse, I"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"honour Van Helmont, but if you do no cures out of the tract of his Method, I beleeve you must study more knowledge in his Medicines then barely how to Translate them, or otherwise you 3 will faile in the honour you aspire unto, and from teaching others, come your selfe to learn from those you unworthily vilifie. You say Pag. 12. The Schooles are ignorant of the Quiddities, and Dihoties of things, do you your selfe understand either your own, or the essence of the lowest inferiour Animals? Pag. 15. Why did you not by the golden Trident of Chymicall Theoremes, whom as a Lady of Ho|nour you have courted, devoutly kissed, and pro|fesse your strict observance to, becalm this Sea of distraction? And as you say, Pag. 16. write in that, in which there is no beaten path, which you think most honourable, because he that leades hath this advantage above others, if others follow him, he hath the glory of the first undertaking, if not the excuse of prejudice: But had not Van Helmont traced out this Path to you, I could think you would have acquiesced to the ancient opinions, and not have aspired to be reckoned amongst the publick Benefactors of Civill and Humane life. Pag. 35. You have a jerke at Bartholomeus Ca|richterus, but I beleeve your own learning and judgment will hardly bring you to be a Physitian to so great an Emperour as Maximillian the 4 Second. For your threefold Character you give of a good Purge, Pag. 80. I hardly be|leeve your Patients will be so happy as to meet with such from you. The London Dispensatory hath variety of medicines, some following one Author, and some another, for which purpose it was so enlarged, as thought necessary in respect of the severall variety of judgment, and practises of our Modern Physitians. You say, Pag. 11. reading is no way con|ducible to knowing: If you had never read Van Helmont, you had never written in this stile. You say, Pag. 11. The disease known is not the halfe way to the cure, but if you know not the disease, I conceive you would hardly, or blindly come to the cure of them. You write, Pag. 15. The Physitians like to the self-conceited Laodiceans, while they presume they keep the keyes of the Sci|ence, they neither enter themselves into the Closet, and inner Parlour of Nature, nor admit, willingly, others that would. But observe your own in|circumspection and levitie: For had you peru|sed their Pharmacopoea, published 1650. A Capite ad Calcèm, you could not have committed so grosse an error, (nor did their former want pre|scriptions of Chymick medicines) but if you 5 please to cast your eye on it, from Pag. 187. ad fi|nem Libri, you may see many good Chymick pre|parations, besides the multitude of other prescrip|tions, which are left to the judgement and choyce of Ingenious Practitioners, to fetch out of other Chymick Authors. And had you but cast your eye on their care|full expression, in fine Pharmacopoeae, you would have been silent, or written more temperately, which I must expose to your knowledge in their own words.

Now judge of the condition you stand in with knowing men. 6 Hath not Rome, France, Augusta, Collen, Amsterdam, and other Nations their severall Pharmacopaeas? Must all be drowned, if Noah, your petty Arke hold them not up. Pag. 107, and 108. Concer|ning Glisters, that they never reach to the Ileon, or have any nourishing quality. Bartholinus in his Physicall exercitations, hath a tract against that opinion; where, by his au|thorities, experiments, and reasons, you might be somewhat staggered, if you do not jurare in ver|ba Magistri: against whom Doctor Heers, in his tractate de Fontibus spadanis, casteth forth bit|terrer language then I will throw upon you; yet I desire you to remember what Doctor Met|calfe of Cambridge not long since said, on the cen|sures of some nimble-tounged Scholars on the grave Academians: You young men think us old men fooles, but we old men know you are so. And be not offended that I advise you, that would be held Magistrum in Artibus, to study also to be Magistrum in Moribus. But I will conclude with these two Grammar verses, Adde quod ingenuas dedicisse fideliter Artes Emollit mores, nec sinit esse [...]. And must tell you, for your rash extravagant 7 censures, you are worthy to be transmitted back to the Colledge Censors, or Deanes. W. I. 9 FRIEND CULPEPR, I Had thought the sober animadversions were given you lately upon the publishing of the translation of Pa|pius, would have reformed your insolent Language you formerly used against your bettters; but I see Quo semel est imbuta recens servabit odorem Testa diu. The Vessell cannot put off the first foetid smell it received, for in your disponsatory Epistle, and in these of your Mid|wifery with a great deale of rayling, and nonsence, as if it were Cuckow-moneth with you, you chatter still in one note, against Priests, and Physitians, and cry out, Wee are Prisoners, and kept in darknesse, and who are our Jaylors but Schollers: Out of which by your selfe-con|ceited omniscience you undertake to deliver them, from the unsufferable ignorance men and women are now trained up in, and teach them a desperate unwarrantable 2 [...] 3 [...] 4 [...] 5 [...] 6 [...] 7 [...] [...] 9 [...] practice. And this is done, you say, to uphold a Company of Lazie Doctors, most of whose covetuousnesse outweighes their witts, as a Milstone outweighes a feather, &c. I can|not but smile at your nonsence similitudes; but I shall ac|count you an exact Mathematician, if you can tell me how many feathers would counterpoyse a milstone, but that task would make your braine as light as your tongue. I all|waies conceived men were bred up in callings, to enable"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"them in future to preserve themselves and their Families, and in their professions to be serviceable to the Common-wealth, and might lawfully live by them. I pray, why do you translate but to live by it not agere stultum, & Zoi|lum? I wonder whether gaine put you not at first (when other Trades failed you) to write, or rather translate Phy|sick in your mother tongue: and it seemeth you rather know how to translate Latine, then transferre it into a Sentence, as you do legere, & non intelegere, neglegere est. But I will admit the excuse, tis the Compositors overfight. You say, If any want wisdome, let him aske it of God, not of the Colledge of Physitians; and yet you undertake to teach them; for you say, You intend to lay down some Rules, whereby a man may as well prevent a sicknesse before it comes, as reme|dy it when it comes, and that you will write of the preservation of man, even from his conception to his grave: a great undertaking, and I beleeve too high 5 Mr. Culpeper for your reading, and will scarce be gained out of your translating some fragments of Galens, and some pieces of modern Anatomy. You say, Physitians of our times keep our understanding in as great bondage as Pharoah kept the Hebrew Midwifes bodies, I pray did the other Physitians before them walke in your tract? but why transcend you the text with your foolish additions? what bondage do you read of either the Aegyptian Mid|wifes, or women suffered under Pharaoh themselves, though the males were overcharged with rigor. You confesse God hath given you some little sparkes of Knowledge, and you will not wrap up your talent in a napkin and bury it in the ground: Truly I thinke you need not hide any you have; and for that of rayling you will not. You desire others to judge charitably of you, for Charity and Honesty you say alwaies walk hand in hand together, and think ill of no man: If your own rule be your judge, you are neither Charitable nor Honest: you say in your Epistle to the Reader, The water may be mud|dy in the stream, which is clear in the Fountain, but yours is clear in neither: You say, The Translators have given us a Translation of the Bible (such a one as it is) but have given all the proper names in Scripture in pure Hebrew words in an English Cha|racter, and yet all the Scripture was written for our instruction: Had you been as well versed in the 12 Translations, as you are in rash Censures, you might have found the Hebrew words exactly interpreted, adjoyned to many translations: not conceived so necessary to be joyned to all; because whosoever understood the language well (as God be praised many of our Nation do) they need|ed not that key to open it to them: Besides you say, whole Sentences in Scripture are so translated, that it would make a man sick to see them, I beleeve you mean read them; but why quoate you not the places, as you did before, the fourth or fifth first Chapters of the Book of Chronicles. If you had said some sentences of Scripture are omitted, or perverted, you might justly have taxed the lazie ignorant Printers, both here and beyond the Seas, in these times, that have not had so much care of their Presses in putting forth those sacred Bookes, as your Printer hath had of yours. You say, The first vertue a Child aimes at so soon as it is born is knowledge. I would gladly learn what Virtue is native; I conceive them dative, and that scientia is rather acquisita, then nata, if it be true nemo nascitur artifex; or the Platonick opinion hold, man is Tabala rasa, capeable of impressions, but hath none writ|ten in it. The desire to be as Gods was the cause of our Pa|rents first fall, knowledge of good and evill, but the know|ledge of Good comes onely from God, the Fountaine of good|nesse, in whose stream you must be dipped, before you desert your pride, and selfe-love, and put on humility. You say, 13 Had not the Priests formerly absconded the mysteries of Truth from us, Sermons would have been so cheape that they would have been cried about streets for three halfpence a dozen; You might have done well to have expressed your selfe, whether you meant our Priests, or the Romane, for I dare justifie a few of the Sermons of our late reverend Divines, as An|drewes, Hierons, Holsworth, Adams, and many others which I could name, are of farr greater worth and esteeme, then your"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"dispensatory, unlesse with some ignorants and women: Though you undervalue Sermons at a lesse rate then sparrowes, when your learned labours are prized at five or six shillings a piece. For Gardiner, I think eve|ry good Christian abhorreth his name and life; and I know no man desires to die his death. Gyant proportions have often Pigmy conceits, but our gentlemans fancy farre out|strips. Bayards leape, who brings Dianas Image from Ephesus to jumpe to England at one leape, where silver shrines must be made for her still. It is a Riddle to my understanding, where the Image and Shrines are; and I should be glad to see you cleare that passage, of the Image fell downe from Jupiter, and that of the silver shrines from impertinent nonsence, and shew how you can make them correspond with our Physitians. Tis true you put an effigies Image, or sculpture before every book you write; I conceive you meane not your owne, I confesse I 4 have that in your Book at Amen Corner, but for your Silver smith and shrines you write of, I hardly beleeve you will have one, unlesse the Midwifes you flatter so, make you one. For Amen Corner, I perswade my selfe, tis a for|midable place to you, for feare of dissection, for you never durst hitherto venture your approbation there before the Doctors for your sufficiency in your trade you were bound to, and some-while brought up in: And for your judgement in Physick, I know you dare not come thither to the test, though you raile against them. Pray let me not trouble your weake braines with a relation of a Gentleman and Scholars, censure upon your Book, who perusing some passages in it in a Booksellers shop, asked whether Culpeper made that obsceane book or no, and being answered he did, replied, truly Culpeper hath made Cul-paper, paper fit to wipe ones breech withall. Where you writ, You could have written deeper notions in Physick then shall be found in this book: I must tell you, you would seeme to be a Physitian, who have scarce aspired to the Apothecary. But the Colledg hath wrapt up their Children in blankets of ignorance, have they not shut them up in a Chamber, as tis related your Patron sometines did you: you say, man may meddle with generalls, but be|fore he meddle with particulars, let him looke to himselfe: But you have Lynceus eyes in others affaires, sed non vides manticae quod in tergo est. He is a 1 saucy insolent Souldier speakes irreverently against the Ge|rall under whose Colours he marcheth, you professe your self studient in Physick, but want some Physick your self to purge away the Malignant humor possesseth you, against the honourable Society of the Colledge of Physitians: A little Hellebor would do well to purge your braines with, if you could but jump over as easily to Italy or Greece, where it growes, as Dianas Image did hither. Were you asleep or awake when you saw it jumpe so farr, otherwise I shall think it like one of the stories in the Mirror of Knighthood. Every bird thinks his own young one fairest suum cuique pulchrum, you acknowledge the direction for Midwives to be your own child, but whether you are more properly a borrower or translator, then Father, Judicent Medici. Tis a slovenly Bird bewrayes his own nest and though you seem to adhere to Hypocrates you shall never be counted Harpocrates for he was borne with one hand on his mouth, and the other on his members, but you will close yours upon neither. But I will conclude with our Mercury, with a story of Mercury out of our Latine Emblems. Mercury having a good conceipt of himselfe (as our Mercury hath) desirous to know what opinions mortalls conceived of him, would needs descend, and fixed on a Statuaries shop, where lighting and comming in, he spies many Images of the Gods and Goddesses, and enquires the price of them but not see|ing his owne, enquires whether he had the Statue of Mer|cury 16 or no, he replied he had, and fetched him forth of a bye corner he had in his shop of whom Mercury demanded what price he would aske for it, the Statuary replyed, Sir, If you mean in good earnest to buy the other Statues you Cheapned, you shall have him into the bargain, whereupon Mercury went away discontented, I leave the Morall to your own application: and your selfe also; wishing you more government in your tongue, and"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"discression in your pen, hereafter, concluding with that saying, His tongue is no slander, whose tongue is all slander, Your well willer, and a wellwisher to the Substances not shad|dowes of Physick. W. J. From Amen Corner, The Epistle to the Reader. COURTEOUS READER, THere having come to my hands three severall Bookes; Phioravants Secrets, and also his Chyrurgery, to which is added The Iewell of Practice: Published a good while since by JOHN HESTER, a Spagyrick Pro|fessor, in his time of eminent note: And know|ing the Books very scarce, and out of Print, much desired by Ingenuous Practitioners in Phy|sick, I have for the Publick good communica|ted those three severall Books to my Friend: assu|ring my selfe out of my knowledge of the Books, that there are in them contained many Chymica arcana, which will be much advantagious to Spagyrick Students, with the more confidence, be|cause whosoever desireth to have, and make use of the choycest Secrets delivered in them, may have them faithfully made up, and dispenced in Amen-Corner, by W. I. Chymist to that honoura|ble Society, and Colledge of London Physitians, who hath heretofore made up the choisest of them, for sundry Physitians, who have earnest|ly desired them, and with good successe used them: And I doubt not, but they will receive as good satisfaction in their compositions, as that worthy Spagyrick, (that from an Italian Coate, put them into an English Vesture) formerly gave them: Desiring you for your fuller approba|tion to peruse his Epistle praefixed before his translation, which I presume, will give you that content is desired from your Friend, W. I. M. B. A SHORT DISCOURSE OF THE SECRETS OF THE Most Famous Knight and Excel|lent Physitian and Chirurgion, Lord PHIORAVANT[...]. CHAP. I. What thing infirmitie is, and whereof it proceedeth. SIcknesse or Infirmitie is no other thing then a distemperature of humours in the bodies of creatures, as well reasonable as unreasonable, which are subject to sickness and to death. And these doe not proceed of any other thing, then of the divers and sundry disorders committed"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"many waies, which disorders every man might very well de|fend himself from, if he would. And these disorders which are thus committed are very many, whereof I will name you a few, and will tell you also of the infirmities which follow them. There are many which disorder themselves in their eating, 2 and in the varietie and superfluitie of meats, and so corrupt themselves; and of such corruption engendreth ill dispositi|on of the stomack, and losse of appetite, and thence com|eth the Itch, and diseases of the legs, and other like matters, which commonly proceed of much repletion· Others disor|der themselves in the excess of Lecherie, of which disorder cometh debilitie of the Reins, want of the sight, weakness of the brains, and oftentimes diseases about the Yard, and o|ther kinde of infirmities hanging upon the French sicknesse. Some disorder themselves in fishing, standing much in the water; and of this accesse cometh coldnesse of the Nerves, pains of the legs and feet, and such other things which such accesse causeth. Other some disorder themselves in hunting, in such sort, as they take heat, cold, weariness, hunger and thirst; of which disorder there followeth Agues, Opilations, Rheums, Numnesse, and such like things; which, with such disorder and great travell, commonly are wont to bee caused. And in divers other manners men may disorder themselves, which at this time I will omit, because I will not be over-tedious to the Reader. It sufficeth, so that I shew the sub|stance of the thing, and to doe it, that every one may un|derstand it. If then the causes are infinite, by which infir|mities or sickness come, and the remedies a great many more then enough to cure them: I mean therefore to set down in the Chapters following the infirmities, together with the remedies, with the which they may be healed, beginning with the infirmities which men have from their birth unto their death, discoursing of them one after an other. And first I will speak of Infants and children, which happen into the falling sicknesse assoon as they are born. CHAP. II. To help the falling sickness in young Children. THe Falling Sickness is a disease, the which in young Chil|dren is caused of great humiditie in the head, and the cure thereof according to our Order, is with drying things 3 which dissolveth that humiditie, and the Remedie is this: Take our Cerot Magistrale, and spread it on a cloth the breadth of two fingers square, and strew thereon the powder of Cantharides: the which of his own quality and nature is at|tractive, and bringeth forth great quantity of water: then lay this Cerot in the nuke of the neck, and there let it lye at the least eight or ten daies, taking it off every day, and making it clean, then lay it on that place again. Likewise you shall annoint the head with Oleum Petroleum, the which is very dry|ing and penetrative; because it cometh forth of a Mine under the earth, the which continually doth boil, and so cometh forth with the water, and then is separated. This Oil hath a mar|vellous vertue in himself, that it defendeth the fire, for if a man annoint his hands therewith, he may wash his hands with molten Lead presently, and never hurt him: and that cometh through a certain hidden vertue in that Oil. Also you shall understand, that this Oil will burn being set on fire, and yet it will not hurt or scald any thing which it falleth on, or toucheth it."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":" CHAP. III. To help young Children of certain grosse Scabs, that come in the head and face. THese grosse scabs that come in the head and face, are caused of abundance of fatness, and moisture of the milk of the Nurse; for the child being tender and weak of com|plexion, is not apt to digest that superfluous humour, and so Nature driveth it forth in that order, with great abundance of humiditie, And the best remedie is, That you shall give the child every morning one scruple to drinke, of our E|lixar vitae, because it is a friend to Nature, and nourisheth the bodie, and drieth up superfluous moisture, and so the child shall be holpen. Also you shall annoint the child with our Magno liquore, the which is temperate of nature, and doth pe|netrate, and so causeth solution of that humour. 4 CHAP. IV. To help young Children of the Rupture. THe Rupture is caused two waies, the one through weak|nesse of the place, and the other through much crying, and the remedie is thus: You shall make a Trusse fit for the childe that shall come very close, and then let them use our Electuarie of Consolida majore, the which is written in my dis|course of Chirurgerie, with divers of my Medicines: And al|so you shall give the child to drink the powder of Alkimil|la in wine; and every night you shall annoint the Rup|ture with our Oleum Philosophorum, made of Turpentine and Waxe: the which is so peircing, that it warmeth the place that is broke, and helpeth it to siccatrize. And so using these three Medicines, thou shalt help him quickly, for this have I proved an infinite of times, and alwaies have had good successe, thanks be to God. CHAP. V. Of the small Poxe that come to Children. THe Small Pox are caused of superfluous choller and flegm, the which is mixed with the bloud, and so continuing a cer|tain time it doth encrease so much, that Nature cannot bear it, and so driveth it forth with a great accident of a Fever, the which commonly doth continue four or five daies together, and then cometh forth certain wheals or bladders full of cor|ruption, which within three daies will break and run forth, and many drie. You shall understand that there are some so weak of Nature that they cannot come forth, but remain within, and so having no evaporation outwardly, it doth choak them, and so die, and that is the cause why so many creatures from four yeers old to ten doe die without help. And therefore I con|sidering the true cause of the disease, I have also found out the true remedie to help them, and that is this. When the child feeleth that Accident, give him presently one drachm 5 of our Aromatico to eat: The which hath such force and vertue attractive, that it joyning unto the stomack draweth unto it all the humours that offend,"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"and carrieth them forth both by vo|mit and sege, and so leaveth Nature eased, and the partie out of danger. Then after that anoint him four evenings with our Balsamo artificiato, and lay him down to sweat, and so he shall be well. CHAP. VI. Of the Fersa or Measels that come to young Children. THe Measels that cometh to Children, commonly cometh after the small poxe one yeer or two, or three, and is caused of the aforesaid cause; and there is no other diffe|rence between them, but that the person is of more age and strength, and both come with an accident of a Fever, but in this cause they come forth thicker, and they dry without breaking or running. Neverthelesse, this many times causeth death, if it be not holpen quickly, and with the remedies ap|propriate. You shall understand that this doth not come with so great vehemencie as the other doth. You shall onely de|fend the heart and preserve the stomack from corruption, and putrefaction, and so you shall help them quickly. The Re|medies are these: You shall give them four or five mornings this drinke: Take Julep of Violets, {ounce} ii. Rosewater, {ounce} iiii. Oile of Vitriol four grains, mixe them and drink it cold: for this is a rare Medicine. CHAP. VII. Of Waxing Kernels, which are called of some Scrophulae. THese Kernels that commonly come in the throat of young Children, are caused of superfluous melancholy humours corrupted, and are a kinde of Ulcer, very hard to be holpen, and evill to have, for when they are broke they cause exces|sive pain, because thereunto runneth great abundance of hu|mours, 6 and are so hot and corrupt, that it is impossible to help them with outward Medicines onely, because they pro|ceed of an inward cause. Therefore if thou wilt help them, first remove the Cause, and then cure the Effect. First therefore thou shalt give them our Sirrup against Me|lancholick humours, written in our discourse of Chirurgerie, and then give him a Dose of our Aromatico fasting, and that will evacuate the stomack of choler and flegm, and drie up those humours that run to the sores. The Medicines that you shall use to the sore, are two: The first is our Costick, which being laid on the sore, doth mortifie it in four and twen|tie hours, and taketh away the corruption. Note, that you may not take away the Askar, untill such time as it falleth out of himself, then lay thereon the black Cerot of Godfre|do de Medic. the which Cerot is written also in Galen. And in short space it will be holp, as I have proved divers times. CHAP. VIII. Of divers sorts of Scabs, and their Remedies."},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"SCabs proceed of divers and sundry causes; Neverthelesse, they all are caused of putrefied blood, as you may see by dai|ly experience. But the said putrefaction may be caused of divers accidents, as by eating much moist and fat meat. It may be caused of a corrupt humour of the French Pox, and of divers other causes, which I will leave at this time. There|fore if thou wilt help any of the aforesaid causes, it would be necessary to use Purgations, and Unctions: The Purgations are two, and the Unctions also two. The first Purgation is half an ounce of our Electuario Angelico, which take in the morning fasting thereon at the least four hours: then take for ten daies together our Soluble Sirrup; the dose is from {ounce}. iiii. to {ounce}. vi. And then if the Scabs come of the Pox, you shall annoint them five or six nights with our Unguento mag|no, and they shall be holpen. But if the scabs come of any other cause, you shall annoint them with Unguento de Lithar|giro simple, after they are well purged. The Unguent is 7 made with Vineger, with the Oil of Roses, and with Li|targe. CHAP. IX. Against Worms in Children. THis is a rare secret against the Worms, the which I have used a long time, and alwaies have had good successe. Take the seed of Levant, the which is sweet, and is called in Italian Sementina, and the seeds of Carduus Benedictus, and of a certain Herb growing on the Sea, called Carolina, ana: stamp it very fine, and give thereof one drachm in honey, and it will kill the Worms, also thou shalt understand that I have a great secret against the Worms, the which I will shew thee; for it may be used more safer then any of these Hearbs above na|med: You shall annoint all the bodie over (leaving no part) with our Balm Artificiall, and give the Patient thereof to drink {dram}. i. with Wine or Broth. Thou shalt understand, though the child have no Worms, yet the Medicine will doe him great good, because it helpeth against all manner of diseases that may happen unto children, and also to other persons. CHAP. X. Of certain Warts or Carvoli, that come on the Yard of a man. VVHen Children have passed the foresaid diseases, and that they come to the age of fourteen yeers, or fifteen, or more, and that they begin to fall among women, many times by some accidents, they get these Carvoli, or Warts on the Yard. And they are of divers kinds, for some come on the ve|ry skin, and some come on the flesh or end of the Yeard. Some are as though they were burnt or scorched, and other like Ulcers, and other like Warts. Those that come as though they were scorched are of small importance, and may be easily hel|ped, for if you touch them once or twice with our Aqua reali, they will be whole. Those which are Ulcerated are evil to heal, 8 yet you shall use no strong Medicines thereto, but onely dresse them with our Magno liquore, and in short time they will be whole. Those that are like Warts are very evil to be help'd, for you must mortifie them with our Costick, one after another. But if they be not mortified at once, touch them again, and a|gain. if need require; and when they are mortified, help them onely with our Magno liquore, untill they be whole: And with this Order I have cured a number."},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":" CHAP. XI. Of the Running of the Reins. THe running of the Reins most commonly cometh of the much use of women, or because those women are cor|rupted with a certain distemperature of heat, that is able to corrupt a man using with her. And of this running there may grow divers diseases, as you may see by those that are troubled therewith, if they be not helped as they ought to be. One of the diseases that may come of this, is great pains in the back, because it doth weaken the vertue of the Reins. There may come also a great burning in the Yeard, and botches in the Groin, and such like, all which are hard to bee dissolved. The cure of this disease is, You shall take three times our Pills called Pillolae Aquilonae, every third day once, that being done, he shall use this Electuarie seven or eight daies together. Take a certain shell which is smooth, and is called of some Calcinelli, and of some Toninole, and of some Tel|line; Take them and burn them, make it into fine pow|der, and take thereof {ounce} i. the buds of Cankers or wild Eg|lantine that the Rose cometh of, it is called in Italian Rose canine, {ounce}. di. Hysope of the Mountain {dram}. ii. white honie crude {ounce}. vi. Make thereof an Electuarie without fire. The dose is, {ounce}. i, in the morning fasting, and at night before meat. Note, that when you use this Medicine, you shall eat no Pork, nor Fish, nor slimie things. 9 CHAP. XII. Of a Botch which is caused of a corrupt humour, which is a kind of Pox. I Would here shewe the cause more plainer, but that there are divers which have shewed it plaine enough: but I will shew thee the true secret and remedy to help them. First, Thou shalt give them ten mornings together our Soluble Sirrupe, and then take our Aromatico three times, that being done, and that the botch is open, you shall dresse it with our Magno liquore upon a tent, and lay upon the sore our Magistrale Cerotte, and with these two medicines thou shalt help it from the beginning to the ending, as I have seen the experience divers times. CHAP. XIII. Of Pellarella that causeth the haire to fall off. PEllarella, or Morphewe, is a kind of Pox, and is one of the first Presagia of that disease, and is a corrupt humour, and so drying, that in short time it mortifieth the haire of the head and beard, and eye-browes, and causeth them to fall off. You shall understand that this disease is such a thing, that it cannot be helped by any meanes, except it be taken in time, before the haire be mortified. Neverthelesse I will shew a secret unto the World, to know when a man hath that"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"disease or no, and in what time he may help it that they shall not fall. The secret is this, Thou shalt understand, that the beginning of Pellarella, is one Carvoli or more that cometh upon the Yeard, the which seemeth to be of little importance, because they are holpen with ease, but within ten, or fifteen daies after they are whole, there will come a certaine alteration in the throate, which will not suffer him to swallow his meat, which doth indure com|monly eight or ten daies, and so goe away by it selfe without any medicine, and in that time the haire is mortified, and then within two or three moneths the haire will fall: so that 10 this is the cause why they cannot be help'd when they fall away, for the time was passed before, and the rootes mortified. There|fore if thou wilt keep thy self from running into such a great danger, thou maiest do it easily if thou take it in time: and the remedie is this. When you have had any of these Carvoli, and that after there cometh an alteration in the throate, then presently purge, and use a defensive unction that the haire may not mortifie. You shall purge him nine dayes every morning with our Sirupo Magistrale, and fast thereon four houres. The dose is from {ounce} iii. to {ounce} vi. that being done, you shall give him {ounce}. di. of Electuario Angelica, according to the recept, and in the mean time annoint all his face and head with our Magno liquore, and doing thus, it is not possible that the haire should fall off. This is a secret, the which few men have known, and never written of any before this time, and is of so great importance, that it were necessarie to be known for an universall health, that every man might keep himself from this disease. CHAP. XIIII. Of Scabbes that come through the Pox. THe Scabbes that come through the Pox, are of divers sorts; as you may see by experience: yet all may be helped with one order of medicine, because they proceed of no other thing then of the evill disposition of that disease. And these most commonly do proceed and come after Pellarella, and this is the cure. You shall give him our Soluble Sirrup every morning warm, with two ounces of Mel Rosarum, and lay him down to sweat, and cover him well, and then at night annoint him with Vnguento di Lithargiro, and thus doing five, or six daies, he shall be helped. For with this order I have helped an infinite num|ber, to my great honour, and satisfaction of the Patient. 11 CHAP. XV. Of certaine Tumours, or swellings in divers parts of the body. SWellings, which use to come to man, are called Tumours a|gainst nature, and may come of divers causes, as by cold, and they do cause inflammations without paine, and most com|monly they come in the articular parts: There are others which are caused of hot humours, and those are called Risepelli: There are other that come of the Pox, and these come in the head, and on the legges and armes, and are of evill digestion, because they are engendered of corrupt, viscous, and crude humours. You shall understand that these three kindes do dif|fer in qualitie, and are also helped with sundry medicines. Those that come of cold, are windie humours, and may be hel|ped with bathes of hearbes, and hot unctions that have virtue to dissolve the wind. The hearbes to"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"make the bath, are these: Nettles, Mallowes, Pelletory of the wall, Bran and Ashes, and make thereof a bath; and then annoint them with our Oleum Philosophorum, made of Turpentine and Wax. Those that come of hot humours, you shall wash with Aqua Vitae, because it openeth the pores, and dissolveth that heat. Those that are come of the Pox, are evill to heale, and his cure must be with great purging: and the chiefest thing that you can give him, is our potion of Lignum Vitae, because it doth make thin those gross humours, and dissolve the swellings, if it be taken according to the order of the recept, the which is written in this Book. And so with this order thou shalt help them per|fectly. CHAP. XVI. Of Ache in divers parts of the body. AChes, that come to divers parts of the Bodies, do spring of divers causes, as it is said before of the Swellings, or Tu|mours: but for the most part now in this our time, they are 12 caused of the Pox, and those kinds of Aches are evill to be helped, because they are engendered of viscous humours, and putrefaction of the bloud, and of evill disposition of the Liver. And the cure of those Aches, is to purge the body, and purifie the Liver: and that thou shalt do with our Soluble Sir|rupe, taking it ten dayes: and then take our Electuario Ange|lica, or Pillole Aquilone, and then use your wine of Lignum sanctum, and sweat therewith as much as thou canst, for it is warm and drie, and apperative, and provoketh sweate, and so they shall be helpt. But if it happen that this will not help, then annoint them three or four times with our Vnguento magno, and without all doubt by Gods grace, they shall be helped and sound of that disease. CHAP. XVII. Of the Cough in the stomack. THe Cough cometh divers and sundry waies to the sto|mack, as by cold, and that is one of the most common causes that may be, and is of small importance, because it will goe away of it selfe without medicine. There is another kind of Cough that troubleth much old folke, and that is of a Ca|tarrhous humour. The third kind of Cough written of by us, is that which cometh to those that have the Fever Hectick. Also there is another kind which is caused of the French Pox. And these are the foure kindes of Coughes that do commonly happen vnto men and women. The first kind of Cough that happeneth unto man through cold, is easie to be helped, for na|ture of it self will help it without any other helpe: but if thou wilt helpe nature thou maiest with ease, and that shall be with eating drie and apperatiue meates, and drinking good wine, and so the Cough will goe away quickly. But the Cough which cometh to old folk, is caused of a Catarrhous humour, which is nothing else but debilitie of nature, for lack of naturall heat, the which causeth the stomack that it cannot digest his meate in such order as it should, but ingendreth those superfluous humours, that cause the Cough. And this must be helped with 13 keeping of diet; that is, to eat little meat, and to use thing that warm the stomack and help digestion, and this thou shalt doe in this order. Take {dram}. ii. of our Aromatico, which hath vertue to evacuate the stomack, and then use our Quintessence of Wine, and annoint the stomack with our Balm artificiall, and so"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"shalt thou help this kind of Cough. The third kind of Cough, which is caused of the Fever He|ctick, is of evill nature, that I dare say nothing nor shew a Medicine, because the most part that are troubled therewith, go to Church and never return again to their houses, as you may see by experience. The fourth kind of Cough is devi|lish and evill to help, because it is caused of the Pox, and doth not onely hurt the stomack, but causeth great pains to the partie beside. Neverthelesse, thou shalt understand that this is easie to he helped by Gods grace, for them that know the true secret, which is thus: You shall give him eight or ten daies together our Soluble Sirrup, then take two drachms of our Aromatico, and then perfume him with Cinabar five or six mornings, or so long untill that he feel pain in his gums, and then hee shall be whole. For this is a great secret, to help that kind of Cough caused of the Poxe, as I have proved a thousand times with good successe. CHAP. XVIII. Of the white Scab that cometh in the Head. THis Scab is of an evill corruption in the superiour parts, which is caused of abundance of moisture, and heat of the Stomack, which sendeth these vapours up to the head, and so goeth out that way. This is of two kindes, the one is hot and dry, and that is with a certain white crust, without any other kind of putrefaction: the other kind is hot and moist, and that causeth a certain crust, which is full of matter under it; so that as they differ in qualitie, they differ also in cure. Those that are hot and dry, must have Medicines that cool the heat, and extinguish the drinesse, and this thou shalt doe with Sirrup of Citarch, and purge often with Cassia, and use 14 cooling things, as Succorie, Melons, Lettice, and such like. The other kinde which is hot and moist, you must first help the heat, and then dry the humiditie, which you shall doe with vomiting, and purging, and keeping diet, and eating of drying meats. The first drying scab you shall annoint one|ly with our Magno liquore, which without help of any other thing, will cure it after they be purged, as is before said. The second kind you shall help, after the bodie is purged with our Cerot Magistrale, strewing thereon Cantharides in fine powder, which have vertue attractive; by which means it mundifieth the head of that superfluous humiditie, and then annoint him with our Unguento magno, and in short space it will be whole, because it is cold and drie. And so by this means thou mayest heal these two kinds of Scabs, as I have done divers times, having respect to the cause. Ye shall understand that this disease is many times taken from the Nurse, the which is infected with the Pox, and so her milk being corrupted, it corrupteth the child, and therfore there must be good consideration thereof in the cure. CHAP. XIX. Of Risipella. THis Risipella is an inflammation with swelling and red|nesse, the which commonly cometh in the face, arms and legs, and in no other places of the bodie, and it is caused of alteration of the blood, as I will shew you an example by a pot that you seeth your meat in: When it is set on the fire, and is full of liquor, lacking one or two inches of the top, and when it beginneth to boil"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"through the great heat of the fire, it runneth over the pot: and so by the like example we may say, that Risipella is a great alteration of the blood, through superfluous heat; and this occasion of heat proceed|eth of great quantitie of flegm, that is in the stomack; for because assoon as they have vomited the flegm, they are helped of Risipella, for I have seen the experience thereof divers times. Therefore give them of the juyce of Elder-Roots 15 {ounce}. iiii. and of Honie of Roses {ounce}. ii. in the morning fa|sting, for this purgeth the Stomack of flegm, and cooleth the blood, then hold the parts over the fume of hot water, and bathe it with pure Aqua vitae, distilled without flegm: for this is one of the most excellent Medicines that can be found, because it is aperative and attractive, and presently dissolveth that alteration, and taketh away the pain. Also it would be good to use five or six mornings to drinke {ounce}. i. of Julep of Violets, with six grains of Vitriol, for this mundifieth the stomack, and causeth digestion, and of himself is most wholsome, for that it mortifieth all hot diseases. CHAP. XX. Of the Squinancie. THe Squinancie is a certain alteration in the throat, which is caused of a flatuous or windie humor, and this cometh with such a vehemencie, that if it be not holpen quickly, it will choak him, for it stoppeth the conduites where the breath cometh through, and letteth a man to swallow his meat, and the Remedie is this: Take of our Electuario angelica, {ounce}. di. and then touch the throat within with our Aqua reale three or four times, and without annoint it with Oleum Philosophorum of Turpentine and Wax, because it is very drying: And thus using the aforesaid remedies, thou mayest help them with|out letting blood, or any other thing in short space: for herewith I have cured a great number. You shall understand, that oil of Linseed is very appropriate to that matter, if you give the Patient four ounces. Also the tooth of a Bore made in powder, and drunk the quantitie of {dram}. ii. in Linseed oil helpeth the Squinancie. These I have proved divers times. 16 CHAP. XXI. Of the Emerodes that come in the Fundament. THese in Naples be called Moricole, and in Venice, Maroelle, and in Spain, Almorane; and are an alteration of blood in the Emorodiall veins, which many times come forth in the lower parts with great pain, and these are caused of putrified humours of the bodie, and corruption of the blood, which corruption many times cometh of the Pox, or such like diseases. There are also divers kinds, but principally two: The one sort is within the fundament, and causeth great pain when they go to stool: The other sort cometh forth of the fundament, and are not so painfull as the other are. To cure them that are within the Fundament, you shall give the Patient eight or ten mornings our Syrupo Magistrale, and then let him take of our Aromatico, {dram}. ii. and use Glisters wherein is put half an ounce of Aqua reale at a time, and so thou shalt help them. The best remedie for those that come forth is to make incision, or to make a little hole in them, that"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"the blood may come forth which is putrified, and so by evacuation thou shalt help them. Also thou shalt understand, that vomiting is necessarie in the cure of them both, because it openeth the veins. Also oil of Eggs, and oil of Frankin|cense, and oil of Linseed are very profitable to annoint them therewith to ease the pain. CHAP. XXII. A goodly and easie way to help all sorts of Fevers according to our Order. THe Fever Quotidian or continuall Fever, or any other kind whatsoever, do proceed onely of two principall causes, that is, of corruption and putrefaction, as you may perceive how that when the Fever is entred, the Patient is all corrupted, beginning at the stomack, the which is first corrupted. For proof you may alwaies see that assoon as a man is sick, pre|sently 17 he looseth his appetite and cannot eat; afterward it corrupteth the blood, for by experience, if you let them blood, it is alwaies found corrupted, and not as it is in a sound bodie. It corrupteth also the senses, so that the sick is not sta|ble senced, nor cannot sleep, or rest by any means whilst he hath that accident. That it is caused also of Putrifaction you may see by them, that have the Fever. For alwaies when the Fever cometh, presently the stomack doth putrifie, and spit|teth forth filthy spittle: Also it doth putrifie the bodie, because their Excrements that they void are putrified and stinking more then others, and their Urine putrified and alterated from his naturall course. Then seeing the Fever is caused of corruption and putrifaction, there are four things necessarie to be done in the cure thereof. The first is, to evacuate the stomack: The se|cond, to purge by urine: The third, to evacuate the bodie: And the fourth is, to purge by sweat: Which four operations may be done one after another with great ease, and will restore the Patient to his health. But you shall understand, that all cannot be holp, for that God almightie hath made us to die, and when that time cometh, medicines will doe no good, but if that time be not yet come, by the help of God, with these Medicines he shall be restored to his former health. The first thing, as I said, is to take a vomit, which doth evacuate the stomack of choler and flegm, that doth much offend the bodie diseased: After that, evacuate the bodie with those things that the Physician thinketh most convenient for that purpose, for there be many purgations to dissolve the body, and to evacuate malign humours: After that, make him purge by urine. Fourthly, and last of all, give him medicines that o|pen the pores, and that provoketh sweat. And thus with these four operations, the most part shall be holp of that infirmitie with great ease, and in short time: And as I have said, this is a most true order that never faileth, except (as I said before) when the Lord will call them. And as for these medicines, you shall find them written in this book severally with their uses and quantities. 18 CHAP. XXIII. Another cure of the said Fevers. IF thou wilt help the said Fevers according to our order: when the Patient is greatly alterated therewith, thou shalt use five waies wherewith thou shalt easily help them, the which are these."},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"The first as I said before is Vomit: the second eva|cuation of the body: the third evacuation by urine: the fourth to provoke sweat: and the fifth by unction. Neverthelesse each of these alone is sufficient to help the said Fever: but yet u|sing them all five, there is no doubt but thou maiest dissolve any evill sort of maligne Fever, except as I said before, God will call them out of this World: but to the purpose of the cure. First thou shalt set on five or six boxing glasses, according to the com|plexion and age of the infirmed: then the next morning give him one dose of our Electuario angellica, with Sirrup of Sorrell, and water of Sorrell. Then the next morning following give him some Sirrup appropriate for that disease, and put thereto {ounce}. ii. of Sirrupo Magistrale, with Rhabarbe: that being ended, give him three or foure times Julep of Violets with Oyle of Sulphur, made per Campana, the dose of the Julep is {ounce} ii. and of the Oyle of Sulphur four or five graines mixed together, and this you shall take in stead of Sirrup betimes in the morning, and it will make them sweat and purge by urine, which are most necessary for the sick: and in the mean season you shall annoint them every night with Magno liquore, which will make them rest well, and take away all their paines throughout the body, and so by this meanes the Fever shall be perfectly taken away. Al|so take great heed that you take no more blood then is neces|sary, neither let them keep any straight Diet, but let them keep a good regiment of Life. But when this Feaver doth come through some other cause, then it were necessary to remove the principall cause, if thou wilt cure them: For if it be caused of a Catarre, of necessitie you must dissolve the Catarre first; and then help the Fever. Also if the Fever be caused of a wound, it were necessary first to take away the pain of the 19 wound, and then the Fever will depart. And thus in every kind of Fever, it is most necessary to know the originall from whence it is caused: And this is the true way to cure these in|firmities, which I have proved infinite times. CAAP. XXIIII. Of the continuall Fever. THere are many kindes of Fevers, therefore I will mention of them that are most known unto the world, and first of the continuall Fever, that is of those that are onely hot, and continue in one order both day and night, the which is caus'd of alteration and corruption of the humours in the body, which engender so much corruption in the stomack, and in the blood, that they cause that accident of Fever: And the very order to cure it is this. In the beginning of the alteration let him keep a good diet, and drink no wine: and that is done because that corruption is apt to corrupt all that entereth into the body du|ring that alteration, and therefore meates of great substance or nourishment, are sooner turned into greater putrifaction in the body: But when the third day of the Fever is past, then take of our Aromatico {dram}. ii. which will evacuate the stomack of that corruption: and that day that you take this Aromati|co, drink as much crude water as you will: which is done be|cause the stomack shall remaine cleare washed of that corrup|tion, which being done, you shall give him three or four morn|ings our Soluble Sirrup, and give him good meates, and let him drink Wine, because it cannot hurt in any wise, for it cannot putrife in the body: For the sirrup doth evacuate every day the corruption: and when the blood is alterated of that putri|faction, it goeth to the veines, and so disperseth through the whole body. It would be good to set on boxing glasses to take away blood, and also to use drying unctions, as our Balsae|mo artificato, and Oyle of Turpentine and Wax, and thus do|ing (if the Patient be not called of God)"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"thou shalt helpe him within short space. And this is the true secret to use for 20 that Fever, which I have revealed unto the world, that every one might have it at their pleasure. CHAP. XXV. A great Secret that helpeth the continuall Fever. THese Fevers that are not accidentall, that is, not caused of a wound or imposthume, or other kind of infirmitie appa|rent, are caused of a certaine humour between the skin and the flesh, which would have exhalation: as you may see by ex|perience in this kind of Fever, how that sweats and boxing is very appropriate to their solution. And in this case I will shew thee a great remedie, with which after convenient purg|ing thou mayest helpe in manner all those kindes of Fevers. And this is the remedie: Take Oippa ofir, the which is a simple well known to all the world, take of that hearb a small quanti|ty, and stampe it a little, and lay it upon the wrist, and bind it hard, and there let it lye untill it have made a blister full of water, which you shall break, and there will come forth great abundance of water, and by that place the Fever shall be dis|solved. And the reason is, because it evacuateth that humour which engendereth the accident: then the cause being remo|ved, the effect will cease, and the Patient shall be whole. CHAP. XXVI. Of the Fever Tertian. THe Fever Tertian doth not continue in one manner, but cometh and goeth, and is caused of chollerick humours: for assone as the fit cometh it moveth choller, and in many it provoketh vomite. There are two sorts of those Fevers, The one cometh with an accident, first cold, and then hot: and the other sort cometh alwaies hot, when the accident com|eth: and sometimes that accident cometh twice a day, and that is called a double Tertian, which is hard to helpe, because let|ting blood, the diet, and purging of the body are all hurtful and 21 contrary to that disease, therefore I will open to thee a secret wherewith thou shalt help them. Thou shalt give him three hours before the fit {dram} ss. of Eleborus niger in powder, with {ounce}. i. of Mel Rosarum: and after it drink {ounce}. i. of common water, and this you shall take twise, and then use this potion ten dayes every morning. Take Julep of Violets {ounce}. i. fine Aqua vitae {ounce}. di. Oyle of Sulphur, that is perfect iiii. graines, and mixe them together, this mundifieth the stomack, and purgeth by urine, and provoketh sweate, and warmeth the blood: which effects are necessary to the solution of that Fever, giving you great charge that you keep no straight diet in any wise, because it weakneth the stomack, cooleth the blood, and hindereth na|ture, so that the Patient can scarce be helped. But with our order thou shalt help the most part of that Fever. CHAP. XXVII. Of the Fever of Repression."},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"THis Fever is an alteration of the blood, which is caused of being over hot, and then cold and this is called a Fever prop|ter accidens, and is not holp as the other Fevers are: for thou shalt help onely the Repression, and the Fever will go away without any other help. Thou shalt give the Patient of our Aromatico, {dram}. ii. that being done, give him two Sirrups every day, the one in the morning, the other at night two houres after Supper, as hot as you may suffer to drink, and these are the Sirrups. Take Sirrup of Quinces, Stecados, Mel Rosarum, ana, {ounce}. i. new Muste boyled, {ounce}. vi. and in the mean time while you take this Sirrup, it were necessary to make a moist bath with hearbs, as Nettles, Mallowes, Egrimonie, Carduus Benedictus, Rosemary, Origanum, and Calamint, ana lb . iii. Commin, Anniseede, Coli|ander, Sileri montani, ana lb . i. then boyle all those in a great Kettle with water, and then let the Patient sit over the fume, and cover him with clothes untill he sweat. And thus you shall do three times one day after another: and thou shalt helpe him perfectly, as I have had experience. 22 CHAP. XXVIII. Of the Fever Hectick. THis Fever is a viscous and putrified humour in the stomack and lunges, the which is caused of a debility and weak|nesse of nature that cannot digest the offensive humours. There are divers sorts of this Fever, neverthelesse they are all evill to be holpt, and are counted uncurable. Neverthelesse, I will shew thee some excellent remedie very wholsom, that may pleasure them, although they are nigh their death. The first medicine that shall do them good, is our Electuario angellica, of which you shall give halfe an ounce in the morning fasting, for this presently joyneth unto the stomack, and draweth to it all the offensive humours, and carrieth them forth by vomit and seege, and so leaveth the stomack eased and clean, that the Patient thinketh himself whole: But yet the stomack be|ginneth againe to fill with a great suffocation, that will not let the Patient take rest, so that this medicine may well ease them, but not helpe them quite. Also our Elixar vitae doth much good in this disease, and also our Balme artificial: if you annoint the stomack therewith at night when you go to bed. Also use our distillation for the Hectick: these may all helpe a little but not cure. The Fever Hectick may come also of a Catarre, of the Pox, and such like causes, and then they require medi|cines according to the cause: as if the Fever be caused of a Catarre, let them use our Magno liquore to drink, the dose is one ounce at a time, with halfe an ounce of Mel Rosarum, and these use for a moneth at the least. And if it be caused of the Pox, let him take Sarsaparilla, or Lignum vitae, Pillole Aquilone, or such like that will helpe the Pox: and thus doing, the cure will have good successe: but when it is caused of debility of Nature (as is said before) they spit blood untill the end. 23 CHAP. XXIX. A new order wherewith thou maist cure and help the most part of the Fever Hectick."},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"MAny have thought that the Fever Hectick is altogether desperate and uncurable, and that by no meanes it might be resolved: But because it is caused of divers and sundry ac|cidents, I say that many kindes may be helped and cured: For I find it may come of infinite causes, as aforesaid. There is one kind that cometh through the weaknesse of nature it self, and that beginneth to destroy the Lunges, and that kind I find to be incurable, because it is caused of the evill nature of the man, and not through any accident, and in that case I beleeve it cannot be dissolved by any meanes. Also there are many other Hecticks caused of the French-Pox, of which I have seen and cured an infinite, and they are easie to cure: For curing the Pox, the Fever will be dissolved. There is another kind that dependeth of a salt humour, and some other of a Ca|tarre, and of many other things: Therefore if thou wilt help the said Fever, it were necessary to know the true cause where|of it dependeth, the which in my judgement is hard to be known, if that the Patient himself do not tell it: and there|fore it is necessary for the Physitian to examin them well, and to enquire whether they have had any kind or spice of the Mal Francese before, whereof the said Fever might have his original: and so doing, he with his judgement may be resolved of the nature of that infirmity: and if it chaunce that the said Fever had his originall of the Pox, the Phisician may resolve it with me|dicines appropriate for that disease, with purging him strong|ly, and giving him Lignum Sanctum, or Salsa pariglia, and also perfume him with Olibanum Sinaber and Mirrha, ana: and so by the help of God, and meanes of these medicines thou shalt help them all, or at least the most part of that kind of Fever Hectick. But if the Phisician find that kind of Fever to be caused of a Catarre, then use the medicines that help the Catarre, and so the Fever shall be whole. But when he 24 findeth it to be of the weaknesse of Nature, in that case there is no help that is sure. Neverthelesse, I have cured some of them with great difficultie, and with Medicines of great effi|cacie: And that was with giving them every morning one drachm of good Sope in tablets according to our invention, and that they used for a moneth together: the which Sope hath vertue to drie that abundance of spittle, and to heal the Lungs ulcerated, and it also strengthneth the Stomack marvellously: After that I caused them to use our distillation of a Hen for the Hectick, and this they did continually drink: Also I caused them to use our Balsamo artificiato to annoint therewith every night after Supper, the which is peircing, and comforteth and augmenteth naturall strength, and com|forteth much the infirmed: Also I caused them to use Aro|matico Rosato, the which comforteth the weak Stomack. And by this meanes I have help'd some of them as it well known. CHAP. XXX. Of the Fever Quartane. THe Fever Quartane is a motion of a certain accident cold and hot, which is caused of melancholie humours corrupt|ed and putrified, the which every third day doth cause that ac|cident to come, and beginneth with great cold and continu|eth a good while, and then cometh hot. And this Quartane both the ancient Doctors, and these in our time doe count in a manner uncureable. Neverthelesse, I that have sought alwaies to help those diseases which were counted uncurable, amongst the rest have found the true and perfect cure for the Quartane Ague, and to dissolve the melancholie humours, which is done with three Medicines that are rare and marvel|lous to dissolve any Quartane. The first is, Mercurie Preci|pitate without corrosive, giving thereof ten grains, with half an ounce of Sugar Rosate, and that day eat little meat; that"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"being done, take a pound of Iva Artetica, and boil it in eight pound of white wine, and common Honey one pound, untill a 25 third part be consumed, and of that drink morning and eve|ning six ounces warm one hour after supper: And in the mean time annoint every night his Reins with our Balsamum artificiall. Thus doing thou shalt help any Quartane. I have also found other rare waies to cure this Fever Quartane, as hereafter followeth. CHAP. XXXI. The Order to help the Fever Quartane of all sorts, in short time. THe Fever Quartane is caused of a melancholie humour as aforesaid, with a continuall distillation of the head, de|scending to the stomack, and augmenting the evill disposition of the body; and by reason of that distillation, provoketh much sweat when the accident of the Fever cometh: And likewise that distillation causeth such cold in the Marrow of the Reins and Back, and an infinite of other disorders which trouble the bodie greatly. But to avoid all these inconve|niences, and to dissolve wholly that accident of the Quartane according to our order, because I have helped more then any Physitian of our time. I will shew thee how with these Remedies following thou shalt help them, though not all, yet the greater part truly most miraculously, and the Order to dissolve it is thus. You shall give the Patient a dose of our Aromatico in the morning to eat, and drink thereon two or three ounces of good wine, and fast thereon six hours, and this Medicine is most convenient the day of the fit, because the infirmitie removeth great quantitie of humours, and the medicine evacuateth them; and thus giving it three times in the day of the fit, it will work a great operation. But if the Fever be in a person of melancholie complexion, then it is where it would be; for you may see that in a melan|cholie person, the Fever hath more force, then in any other complexion, which proveth, that the Fever, and that com|plexion are most like: But in that case you shall cure them in this Order: You shall give him ten or fifteen daies out 26 Sirrup against the melancholie humour, which is written in this Book, which you shall take two hours before day hot, and then sleep one sleep thereon, and thus doe every mor|ning, and every night annoint all the parts of the body with our Balsamo artificiato, and he shall be holpen. But if it hap|pen that this doth not cure him, let not to give him this reme|die, which most surely (God willing) will help him, and that remedie is our Aqua Balsami, of which he shall take every morning two Drachms fasting, and so continue untill the Fe|ver be gone quite: so that of force using all the aforesaid re|medies, the Fever must needs depart. And the reason is this, that our Aromatico evacuateth the stomack of all impedi|ments by vomit, and letteth the descension of the head, which causeth the accident. Our Syrrup evacuateth the melancholie humour, and dissolveth it by his proper qualitie. Our Balsa|mo the which is subtile and penetravive drieth and comfort|eth the place offended, in such order, that it casteth forth all the matter that may offend Nature. Our Aqua balsami also being drunke, doth dry the evill humours, and augment strength, in so much that it quite extinguisheth the said Quar|tane. And this may be used in all manner of persons, and in all times of the year without any doubt of inconvenience: and it is a new remedie that never was set out before of the Ancients, which I have used to the great profit of the Pati|ents. "},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"CHAP. XXXII. Another discourse a marvellous secret against the said Quar|tane. THe Fever Quartan is caused of melancholie humours, which hath his fit coming every third day, first cold with great thirst, and then cometh the heat, which remaineth with some longer then with other some, and the cause, hereof is hard to be known. Neverthelesse, I seeking out con|tinually naturall things, and the qualitie of the accidents, I doe find that this Fever beginneth alwaies in some particular 27 place, as in the head with a certain pain round about it, or in the nose and ear, or in the Reins and Legs: And there|fore he that can find out the place where first beginneth the accident, may easily help them, because the Fever is dissolved with two things onely, that is, exhalation and exsication, and herein consisteth the secret. The order to make the Exha|lation shall be thus: Make a Cerot of Frankincense, Pitch, Wax, Turpentine, Myrrh and Aloes, upon the which Ce|rot you shall put the powder of Cantharides, and then lay it upon the place where they feel the Fever come first, that is on the particular part where the accident cometh, and this you shall change twice, except the first day of the Fever. And to make the exsication, give him every day in the morning to drinke, {ounce}. di. of our Aqua balsami for twelve daies, and with the Balsamo artificiato annoint every night his Stomack and Reins, and so he shall be helped, giving you charge also that before you use these Medicines, that he take three times our Aromatico, and so he shall be quite helped. CHAP. XXXIII. A secret to help all Fevers in their beginning. VVHen the Fevers are new begun or taken, and that the putrefaction is not yet confirmed, then may it be hel|ped with great ease, but after they have taken their beginning, they are hardly helped. Therefore when the Fever is new begun, you shall give them {dram} ii of our Aromatico fasting in the morning: and the next day about the same hour you shall give them {ounce}. i. of our Uegitabile Sirrup: and the third day you shall give them four Drachms of our Electuario angelica with broth, the which taketh away the Fever altogether. And this opera|tion intendeth onely to the continuall Fever, Quotidian, Ter|tian, and putrified or pestilentiall, but not to the accidentall, or Hectick, nor Quartane: For these three kinds are much differing from the rest, because the accidentall is caused of another infirmitie anterior or going before. The Fever Hectick 28 is caused of weaknesse of nature, and the Quartane is caused of great quantitie of melancholicke humours, and they are cured by contrary meanes unto the first. The accidentall are cured with helping the principall infirmitie: The Hectick is cured by helping of Nature, and preserving the Liver and Lungs from putrefaction: The Quartane is cured with Vo|mits, Unctions, Cerottes, and drying drinks, and these are great secrets to be known: For in this Chapter consisteth a great part of Physick, and Chirurgery if you consider well thereon.

A Secret of one Simple that helpeth in manner all Fevers."},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"THere are an infinite of medicines that dissolve the Fever, but above all other this seemeth to me of great authority, because it helpeth it with such ease, that it is to be wondered at. With this remedie through the Divine goodness, I have cured a great number, and the Secret is this. You shall gather in the Mo|neth of August a certain hearb, which the Italians do call Oreula, which you shall drie and make into powder, of the which you shall give the sick as much as will lie upon a sixpence, with wa|ter or wine, and give it warm in the morning, and fast there|on three or four houres, and thus doing, the Patient shall be helped with great ease, and in short time: for this is a great secret which may be used in all times and in every occasion, and alwaies it worketh an operation in one manner. CHAP. XXXV. Of the Gout. THe Gout which cometh to men, is a distemperature and alteration, which is caused of corrupt and undigested hu|mours, and also of feeding on meats that nourish much, and then to use no exercise, as you may see by the most part of them that be troubled with that disease. Also this disease, both of the old and new Doctors hath been counted uncu|rable, 29 as it is known to every one: But yet I, which have done nothing else but sought out the nature and qualitie of things, have found divers inventions in sundry Arts, as thou mayest read in my Caprici Medicinali, and so amongst the rest, I have found (through the help of God) the true and perfect Secret to help the Gout, so that it shall never come again: Of which disease I have cured a great number in divers Cities of the world, as in Palermo, in Sicilia, in Messina, and in divers places of Calabria, in Naples, in Rome, and in Venice, as it is well known unto the most part of the Inhabitants of those Cities. CHAP. XXXVI. A Note concerning the Cure of the Gout, taken out of a Letter which this Authour wrote unto a certain noble Seigniour, the Duke of Urbine. FIrs;t you shall understand, that the Gout of what kind soe|ver it be, either hot or cold, or of any other temperature, they all come of one onely cause, although they work divers Effects, which Effects come through the complexions of them that have that infirmitie: As for example, to shew it more plainly, you may see that in fat men, the Gout cometh alwaies with inflammation and redness and great pain: In lean persons it cometh alwaies with pains, but with lesse inflamation. In cho|lerick and melancholie persons, it cometh with tumours, and that is Nodosa. And the cause of this infirmitie is, of an evill qualitie ingendered in the stomack, in the Liver, and in the blood: And the cure thereof, is to ease the stomack of that evill, and to purge the Liver and the blood, and to mittigate the pain: All which thou mayest doe with these three Reme|dies following, viz. our Pillole Magistrale, our Unction for the Gout, and our Quinta essentia solutivo: for the Pills doe discharge the stomack, and our Quinta essentia solutivo purgeth the Liver and the blood, and our Unction taketh away the pain, for if you remedie the cause which is onely one, the effect will cease. As concerning the Gout you shall cure it in this Or|der: First,"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"when you feel the pain begin to come, you shall take two doses of those Pills in the morning fasting, one day 30 after another, or if you will, rest a day or two according to your strength, that being done, you shall take every mor|ning {dram}. ii. of our Quinta essentia solutivo in half a Porringer full of the broth of Veal, and a little Sugar, and this take five hours before meat; and keep no streight Diet, but eat rea|sonably, and every night after Supper annoint the grief with our Unction for the Gout, and thus through the help of God, and the vertue of these Medicines, the Gout shall be cu|red. CHAP. XXXVII. Another Discourse upon the same infirmitie of the Gout, and the Order to cure it, taken out of his Book called, Thesaurro della Vita Humana. ALthough the wise & learned of the world, have alwaies be|leeved that the Gout is of divers kinds, yet they have all been deceived; for that infirmitie is one onely, and cometh of one onely cause, although in some it come in manner of Phleg|mone, and in some other like Risipilla, and in other Nodosa, and in other with pain without alteration, and in some other in divers manners; all which is caused through the diversitie of com|plexions, for that one man is flegmatick, the other sanguine, the other cholerick, and the other adust, and thus by these means, many have thought the Gout to have been of divers kindes, whereas indeed it is onely one, and is cured with one onely order, and dissolved altogether for ever; for that in|firmitie is caused of no other then of rotten humours caused of indigestion, and to say truth, we see that the said infir|mity never commeth in manner, but unto those persons that feed well on meats of great nourishment, which for want of exercise, that Nature might digest it, they wanting naturall heat, cannot have their orderly digestion, and for that cause the humours doe ingrossse out of measure, and ingender that infirmitie, and then Nature that alwaies seeketh to ease her self of that which offendeth her, driveth forth that humour unto the extream parts, as the hands, and feet, or other par|ticular 31 parts, and this is the Gout: And these humours many times are cause of Mal francese, and this is all the secret. He therefore that is advertised by me, shall be most cunning in curing of it. CHAP. XXXVIII. What order must be used in curing of the said Gout. SEeing the Gout (as I said before) are grosse humours undi|gested coming of the aforesaid cause, it were most necessa|ry, if thou wilt cure them to do three operations. The first of them is Phlebothomie, which must be done under the tongue, cutting overthwart one of those two veines: For that Phlebo|thomie evacuateth the stomocall humours that are cause of that corruption. The second operation that is to be done, is to as|subtiliate the gross and rotten humours, and to evacuate them quite. The third operation that is to be done, is to preserve nature in good temperature, and to help the digestion, and thus doing, the said infirmity shall be extincted. If therefore thou wilt helpe the Gout, and after they are helped, keep the Patient in good temperature and prosperity of life, it were necessary to do these three operations. After the first is done, as I have said, it were needfull to come to the second, which is to assubtiliate the gross"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"humours, which will be done with four remedies. The first of them is our Quinta essentia solutiva, which subtiliateth the humours, and evacuateth them downwards. The second reme|die is our Electuario angelica, which evacuateth the humours hanging in all parts, and leaveth nature so eased, that it may well prevaile. The third remedie is a Fomentation, which drieth up the humidity of the head and stomack, and by meanes of that operation the disease shall remaine extincted. The fourth and last remedie is our Balsamo against the paines, with which you shall annoint upon the place grieved, for it mitti|gateth the paines greatly. And thus with these four remedies thou shalt help the Gout perfectly, as I have often times done in Venice, and at Rome, and in divers other places of Italy, well known there unto all men. 32 CHAP. XXXIX. The Order to preserve a man from the Gout, when he is once helped. AFter that a man through the divine goodnesse of God shall be helped of the Gout, he may if he will preserve himself in health, with these three noble Remedies. The first of them is our Vegitable Quintessence, the which doth cause good digestion, warmeth the stomack, and defendeth it from corruption, by which Effects it will return Nature in manner as it was in youth, and it preserveth the sight and the hearing, and divers good operations which are all necessarie. The se|cond Remedie is our Oleo incompostibile, with which you shall annoint the stomack, and that will cause digestion, comfort the heart, provoke sleep, and keep the stomack, that therein shall breed no evill qualitie of humours. The third Remedie is, our Pillolae aquilonae, which doth evacuate the humour hang|ing, alwaies when it ingendereth in the stomack, they cleanse the head, and are by their nature against all sorts of pains. And thus with these three Medicines, every one may preserve himself from that infirmitie, as it is daily pro|ved, and seen in Venice, and in divers other places in Italy. CHAP. XL. The cure of a certain Gentleman that was troubled with the Gout, and a great Stitch in his side. THe Cure of this man was with these five Remedies fol|lowing, that is, with our Aromatico, Quinta essentia solutiva, Pillole angelica, Oleo incompostibile, and Quinta essenti Vegita|bile: For you shall understand, that our Aromatico taketh a|way the pains of the Stomack, so that the other Medicines may work their operations the better. Our Quinta essentia solutiva, taketh away the cause of the infirmity, and the Pills take away the evill qualitie. The Unction taketh away the pain: And the Vegitabile Quintessence, preserveth them that 33 it commeth not again. The Dia Aromatico must be taken in the morning fasting, the dose is {dram}. ii. at once. The Quinta-essentia solutiva you shall take with broth of a Capon and Sugar fasting, without any observations, the dose is two or three drachms at a time. Our Pillole Angelica you shall take two hours before supper, the dose is from {dram} i. to {dram}. ii. The Unction you shall annoint after Supper upon the sore places, so often untill the pain be gone. Our Vegitabile Quintessence you"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"shall drinke every morning half an ounce, and thus con|tinuing thou shalt be perfectly whole by Gods help. CHAP. XLI. A Discourse upon the Sciatica, and his remedie. THe Sciatica is so called, because it is upon the bone which is called Scio, and of that it taketh the name Sciatica, the which is caused of an evill qualitie in the Stomack and Liver, the which you may see by the cure; for if ye cure the Stomack, and help the Liver, the Sciatica will cease, and by this means thou mayest see whether I say the truth or no. See|ing then that the Sciatica is caused as is said before, ye shall understand that it is so caused, by reason that the stomack can|not well digest that which it should, and so it causeth crude and undigested humours, of the which Nature would be discharged, he casteth them forth of the stomack, and having no other way to come forth of the Stomack but by the ordinary waies, they doe passe, and of force they must passe by those powers that passe by the Liver, and so the Liver which is able both to resolve the good and the evill qualitie, remaineth still infected of that indisposi|tion, and not being able to digest them according unto the order of Nature, they ingross and become maligne, and then Nature the which with all industrie would discharge himself of that burthen, sending them to the higher parts, sendeth them downwards, and when they come unto Scio, where they must passe with difficultie by certain small muscles, they in|grosse in that place, and cause inflamation and pain, the 34 which Inflamation or swelling, after the bodie is well purged, is resolved with Vesicatores Ventosos, and attractive Cerots and such like things. Also attractive Glisters are most whol|some, because they discharge the humour in the lower parts, and comfort the Sciatica. Neverthelesse, ye shall understand that there are certain and true appropriate Medicines to re|solve it with brevity, the which are these that follow. First, when the Patient is in most extream pain, let him blood un|der the tongue, the which is such a singular remedie, that it causeth the world to wonder thereat: after that purge him with our Soluble Sirrup, six or seven daies, that being done, take away the water which causeth the pain, then comfort the Patient with the Oil that is separated from the flower of flowers, and distilled in a Retort, then all this being done, the Patient shall remain helped to thy great honour. And there|fore he that will cure the Sciatica, it were necessary that hee consider well of the nature and qualitie of the infirmitie, and when they are satisfied to be the Sciatica, in that case cure them according to this our Order, the which by the grace of God, and vertue of these Medicines, they shall remain helped of that indisposition, for this is a great Secret. CHAP. XLII. Of the Pains of the Mother. THe Pains of the Mother which women are troubled with|all, is an alteration in the Matrix, that may come of di|vers causes, as of cold, of moistness, of dryness, of melancho|like humours, of flegmatick, and of cholerick, the which is to be proved divers waies. Neverthelesse, I will shew thee the Secret to cure it generally, and the order is thus. You shall give the Patient a dose of"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"Pillolae Aquilonae fasting, and sleep|ing thereon one sleep, for these Pills doe purge the Matrix, then take Electuario Angelica half an ounce, which purgeth the blood and choller: That being done, take Cantharides in powder {scruple} i. Galingale, and the roots of Mercury, ana. di. {scruple}. mix them altogether, and put it into a little piece of Sarce|net, 35 and binde it like a button, and put it into the Matrix as high as you can, and there let it remain four and twentie hours without moving of it, for it purgeth divinely; and herewith thou maist cure any great impediment in the Matrix: That being done, they shall use our Sirrup against the pains of the Mother, the which comforteth and purgeth all humours in the bodie that offend the Mother: And this is a great secret which was found out by me. You shall understand, that who|soever would know the truth of this disease, it were necessarie for him to be expert in Philosophie, because it is an opera|tion of naturall things, the which cannot be well understood without great knowledge in naturall Philosophie. CHAP. XLIII. Of the pains in the head. THe pain in the Head is a disease of the brains, which is caused of putrified humours in the stomack, the which is like unto a pot that boileth, causing the vapours to ascend, which if they be evill, the fume is evill to the taste and smell; but if there boil any good thing therein, the fumes are plea|sant both to the smell and taste. And so likewise our stomack being filled with good juyce, filleth the brain with good fumes; but being filled with evill corrupt humours, it hurteth the brain, and causeth pains of the head. The like pains of the head may come of alteration of the blood, and to helpe that accident, you must first remove the cause principall, which is done with purging, and evacuating of the sto|mack of those putrified humours; which thou shalt do with our Aromatico, giving it to the Patient two or thre times, every five daies once. The dose is {dram} ii. and then the pain will cease, of what cause soever it doe come; this done, take the juyce of a Beet root one ounce, Oil of bitter Almonds one drachm; mix them well together, and snuffe it up into the nose every morning untill it come into the mouth, for this doth purge the head marvellously; this being done, it would bee 36 \" good to take our Soluble Sirrup four or five mornings cold, and so the Patient shall be holpen. CHAP. XLIV. Of deafness of the Ears. DEafnesse in the Ears doe proceed of divers causes, as of a Catarre, cold, and humiditie of the head. But of what cause soever it come, I will shew thee a true secret to cure them quickly. First purge them eight or ten daies with our Sirupo Magistrale, and then take our Pillole Aquilone, three times, and then perfume them five mornings with this: Take Synabar {ounce}. i. Olibanum, and Myrrh, ana one scruple, mixe them and divide it in five parts, the which you shall occupie at five times, standing over them with your mouth open, that the fume may enter in, for it drieth and resolveth the evill humours in the head that himder the hearing; and thus doing thou shalt be helpt. Neverthelesse, it would be good to put the fat of a silver Eel into the ear, which hath a"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"principall ver|tue to comfort the hearing. Also our Aqua balsami being put into the ear, comforteth the sight and hearing marvel|lously, and all impediments in the head, and evill humours it destroyeth through his qualitie and nature, and augmenteth the good, in such order that using of it thou shalt see great marvells: for these are the true secrets for that disease. CHAP. XLV. Of the Infirmities of eies, and their causes and cures. THe Infirmities of the Eies cometh of divers and sundry causes, of the which I will make mention, especially of those that are of most importance, and most dangerous to hurt the sight. There is one that is called in Italian Razoni, and that is caused of the heat of the blood, and his effects are certain small wheals that run round about the eye-lids, and this Infirmitie is of small importance, for onely with lina|ment 37 of Tutia they may be healed, annointing them three or four times. There is another kind of infirmitie in the eyes that cometh to many, and is caused of moisture and heat in the head, and that is a redness with watering and great burning: And although this be troublesome, yet it is not dangerous to heal. For with purging the head and bodie, and with Boxing glasses, and with certain Unctions appropriate they shall re|main whole. There is another kinde of infirmitie in the eie, and that is when the ball of the eie waxeth out of measure in greatnesse, and this is called Dilatatio pupillae, the which is ve|ry hard to heal. For my part I never saw but one remedie that did preserve it, and that is our Balsamo Artificiato, of the which you shall put every night one drop into the eie, and it will doe thee great pleasure, because it is temperate hot, and hath a penetrative vertue and resolutative, by the which meanes it doth hinder the relaxation, and preserveth the eie. There is yet another sort of infirmitie that causeth the eie to be full of pain, and cometh all thick and filthy, and blindeth it, and this indisposition is caused of Morbo Galli|co; and although it seem foul and uncurable: Neverthelesse, it is easie to be cured if you help the principall cause, and fume the head with Cinabar, Myrrh, and Olibanum, they shall be quickly helped. There is another infirmitie that cometh in the eie, the which is a cloud that ingendereth in the point of the eie upon the ball, and hindereth the sight, and that is easie to be helped, for if you drop therein one drop of our Balm twentie or thirtie daies together, it will resolve it throughly. There are divers other infirmities which doe trouble the eyes, the which I will let passe till another time. CHAP. XLVI. Of the pains in the Teeth. THe pain of the teeth is an accidentall disease, which cometh of divers and sundry causes, of the which causes, I will shew the chiefest. It cometh sometimes of a Rheum in the head, or of a Catarr, or of humiditie in the 38 head, and divers other wayes. Neverthelesse, let it come which way it will, it proceedeth of the head and stomack, the wihch sendeth up vapours, and then fall down again, and cause that pain, and the remedie is this: First, give them our Ma|gistrale Syrupo five or six daies, the which purgeth the blood, and evacuateth the bodie; that being done, take our Ele|ctuario angelico, three times according to the receipt, for this evacuateth the stomack and"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"purgeth the head; and then take our Aqua reale, and hold it in thy mouth a Pater-noster while, and then spit it forth again, and with this order thou shalt help all manner of pains in the teeth, except they bee rotten stumps; and then the best way is to take them forth with an Instrument: but if thou wilt not take them forth and ease the pain, thou mayest touch them with Aqua fortis untill the mar|row be mortified? that being done, you shall hold our Aqua balsami two or three times in your mouth in a day, untill the pain bee gone, and so with this order thou mayest keep them without pain. Also I will shew thee another easie way. Take Henbane seed, and mix it with white Waxe, then cast it on the coals, and hold thy mouth over it to receive the fume, and then thy pain will cease if they be rotten teeth; and this it doth by stupefaction. Also it will be good to hold in thy mouth Mastick, Pellitorie, and Allom, after ye have pur|ged, for this draweth down the matter. CHAP. XLVII. Of a stinking breath. THe stinking breath is a putrefaction the which is caused of the stomack, being corrupted and foul, as you may see by experience of those that have that infirmitie, and the reme|die is this. You shall give them of our Aromatico {dram}. ii. fa|sting, every third day for three times, and then use our Quint|essence for a moneth continually; The dose is {dram}. i. every mor|ning, and after supper two houres, for this comforteth the stomack and the heart, and taketh away the stinking: That being done, take five or six mornings together, every morning 39 f oyle of Turpentine one scruple with white Wine, and so they shall remain helped. CHAP. XLVIII. Of spitting of blood. THe spitting of blood is an alteration of blood in the veins, which alteration is so much, that Nature provoketh it to the stomack, from whence it had his Originall, and doth not come of a vein broken as many have said, as thou maist well see the truth; for if the vein were broke, the blood would come forth at one time or instant without any tarrying, and they would die quickly, the which cometh not by spitting of blood, for they spit none untill the alteration cometh: and this is caused of a kind of Fever that cometh inwardly, that ingen|dereth that alteration, and when his fit cometh, the blood doth alter, and the veins swell, and the blood doth come forth at the proper mouthes of the veins, and so they spit it forth; and when they spit blood, it is the beginning of the Fever Hectick. the which when it is confirmed, is uncurable and mor|tall: But if thou wilt take it at the beginning when they spit blood, it may be helped with ease, and that thou shalt doe with giving them three or four times of our Petra Philosopha|le twelve grains, with halfe an ounce of Sugar Rosate, every third day once; that being done, let him take every morning Oil of Vitriol iiii. grains, with Julep of Violets {ounce}. i. because there is no better medicine in the world that disposeth the al|teration of the blood, then our Petra Philosophale, and the oil of Vitrial mittigateth the heat and extinguisheth the acci|dent. You shall note, that this which I have written is not understood of many as I understand it. And likewise the Medicines to use in that case hath"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"not been put in practise of any man, and the cause is this. That since Physick hath been in use untill this time, the Physicians have not understood of other then the Theorick, and none they cured of pra|ctise and experience, and that is the cause that so few have found the truth. But I that continually doe travell in practise, 40 have found rare things, as I will set forth to the world here|after. CHAP. XLIX. Of diseases of the Liver. THe sicknesse of the Liver is caused of divers and sundry accidents of the bodie, as you may see by experience, when a man is never so little sick, by and by the Liver is alte|rated, and doth no more work well, and that is because the Li|ver is the receptacle of the blood and of the Gall, and the master which ruleth and governeth our bodies, and distribu|teth the blood into the veins, and doth purifie it, separating the sharp and evill parts, and sending it to a certain bladder, which we call the Gall; and when it is so full that it can re|ceive no more, it runneth over, and so causeth the body to become yellow, and thereupon the Urine is yellow, and is so evill, that in short time it dryeth that bodie, so that the Liver being dispensator both of the good and bad qualities of the humours, it cannot be but through the infirmities of the bodie. Also when the Liver is over hot and drie, it causeth the Patient to be lean and dry, and with great heat: and when the Liver is troubled with humiditie and cold, it cau|seth the Patient to become full of sores and scabbs, and these are the effects that come of the Liver when it is distempered. But if thou wilt help it from that indisposition, it were ne|cessarie to evacuate the body and stomack of superfluous hu|mours, which thou shalt do with our Soluble Sirrup, giving it eight or ten daies together cold, and then purge the Sto|mack with our Aromatico fasting in the morning; that being done, you shall use remedies that help the Liver, which a[...] many, as Citrake, Liverwort, Scolopendria, Cycorie, and such like; and so observing this order thou shalt help them. For I have had an infinite of experience of it. 41 CHAP. L. Of diseases of the Lungs. THe infirmities of the Lungs are of two kindes, that is cold and moist, and hot and drie, the which infirmitie is caused of evill temperature of the body. You shall note, that when the Lungs is infected with cold and moist, it will easily turn to that kind of Hectick that causeth the Cough, and to spit matter at the mouth. But when it is grieved with heat and drinesse, it is in danger to turne to a Tissick, the which dis|ease causeth a man to become lean and drie, and keepeth back his breath, and so the one with another they are mortall diseases, so that there can scarce be found any remedie; and therefore I will begin with the first kind, and then with the second, and then the third, and then with the fourth and last, for the which there is no redemption or hope of life. But for the first and second, there are a number of remedies that doe help, the which be these. First, give the Patient of the juyce of the Roots of blew Lillies, {ounce} ii. with Mel"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"Rosarum, {ounce}. i. in the morning fasting, and that use three times, every third day once: That being done, let him use our Elixar vitae for thir|tie or fortie daies together morning and evening; the dose is {dram}. ii. at a time, and also put therein every time half an ounce of our Magno liquore, and drinke it a little warme, for this is a perfect remedie, with which I have cured an infinite num|ber in my daies. And of all the Medicines that ever I found, I never had any like this, because the juyce of the Lilly-root hath vertue attractive that mundifieth the stomack, and the Elixar vitae comforteth and resolveth all Ulcers in the Lungs, and the Magno liquore dissolveth the Catarr, and healeth the stomack, for I have proved it a number of times, as is said before. I remember me that in the year of our Lord, 1557. I being in Rome cured a young man which was a Painter, that was in the house of the Cardinall de Medici, the which had his Lungs ulcerated, and did spit great quantitie of blood, and had a great Catarr and Cough, and did spit also matter, in the which there was no hope of life. I caused him to 42 use the aforesaid remedies, and so in short time he was hel|ped, and not onely he, but a great number more at sundry times. CHAP. LI. Of the Spleen. THe Spleen is never sick but through other diseases, as you may see by experience, how that those that have the Fever Quartane, for the most part have their Spleen alterated and hard, and this proceedeth of evill temperature of the bodie and Liver, that cannot digest the humours, and so Nature sendeth them forth in the weakest parts that are most apt to receive them. So that the Spleen is like a spunge, and very apt to receive that humiditie, that Nature cannot dissolve otherwise, and so by this reason it is most apt to be sick or diseased: therefore if thou wilt cure it, first cure the disease which causeth that alteration, for that being once helped, Nature of it self will help the Spleen without any other Me|dicine, and therefore strive not to help the Spleen with parti|cular Medicines, for it is vain; but look what kinde of dis|ease the Patient is troubled with, and cure that, and then the Spleen will heal well enough. And this is the true way to cure the Spleen. CHAP. LII. Of the Flux of the bodie. THe Flux of the bodie is a distemperature of the guts and stomack, which is caused also of an evill disposition in the Stomack, as well as of all other interiours, and is very troublesome to the Patient, and hard to be helped. Never|thelesse, I will shew thee a secret and that is this. Take of our Petra Philosophale twelve grains, which doth evacuate the humour hanging, and dissolveth the Flux. But when it is a hot Flux with a Fever in the Summer, let him stand two hours after supper in a bath of salt-water of the Sea that is cold: for 43 it is of great effect. You shall understand, that our Petra Philosophale must be taken with Sugar Rosote di. {ounce}. Also when you have done the aforesaid things, you shall take our Sirrup against the melancholy humours five or six mornings. And so using this order, thou shalt help any kind of cruell Flux, as I have proved infinite times."},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":" CHAP. LIII. Of Costivenesse in the body. THis disease is caused of great drinesse and adustion in the body, through the which cause there cometh many diseases: and that is, that our meat lyeth long in the body: and of that cometh indisposition of the stomack, paines in the head, Flux of Urine, alteration of bloud, augmenting of choller, and such like. Therefore if thou wilt help these in|conveniences, it were necessary to seek the principall cause, and to cause the body to be loose: and that thou shalt doe with our Sirrup Magistrale, using it according to reason every morning. For it evacuateth the lower parts, and cooleth the Liver, and purgeth the bloud, and consumeth chol|ler, and helpeth digestion. And with this onely shalt thou help them perfectly. CHAP. LIV. Of the Flux of Urine. THe Flux of Urine is an alteration of the pores, and opening of the reines, caused of indigestion in the body, as you may see by experience. This Flux weakeneth the stomack, and the reines, and taketh away the tast, and letteth sleep: so that many times of these effects come cruell diseases, as Gonorhea, the Strangury, Ulcerations in the Yeard, and such like: and therefore if thou wilt help the aforesaid disease, use this Me|dicine. Let him take of our Aromatico two drachmes, and drink thereon a little water, and then let him use of this Sirrup 44 every morning warm {ounce}. iiii. Take Sage, Carduus Benedictus, Egrimony, Betony, Citrake, Scolopendria, Cicorie, of each one handfull, red Saunders, Box, ana {ounce}. iiii. Alloes, Epatick, Coloquintida, Sinne, Turbit, Hermodactiles, ana {ounce}. i. course Sugar one pound and a half, commom Hony one pound: then lay all the aforesaid things to infuse in five and twenty pound of White wine the space of twelve houres: then boile them close untill half be consumed: then strain it without expres|sion, and put thereto a carrect of Musk dissolved in {ounce}, iiii. of Rosewater: and of this take every morning three or four ounces, and fast thereon at the least four or five hours, and in the mean time that you use this Sirrup, you shall not eat Hogs flesh, nor Fish, nor salt things, nor Rapes, nor Raddish, nor Parsly, nor any other aperative thing: This being done, take Hysop of the Mountain that is dried lb . ii. and boyle it in thirty pound of White wine, and put thereto one pound of Hony, letting them boyle till the fourth part be consumed, and then strain it, and drink it continually for fourteen or fifteen dayes. And by this means thou shalt have help God willing. CHAP. LV. A discourse upon the retention of Urine, and his cure. THe causes of the retention of Urine are many, among the which, there are three principally above the rest, and are so manifest, that every one may understand them: and are these. Stones, as well great, as gravell, viscosity in the Reins and Bladder, and alteration in the pores: And thus"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"through those three accidents, most commonly they cannot make water: the which if thou wilt help, it will be somewhat hard, because you must understand the cause thereof, the which is not easily done of every man: for he that knoweth not the cause, can lesse help the effect, and he that knoweth not the effect, can lesse help them. And therefore, I say, he that will help those that cannot make water, because of the stone in the bladder, he must seringe them to take forth the Urine: but if thou wilt help 45 those that cannot make water through the gravell, you shall give them our Pillole Aquilone: and then give them a Flint|stone made in fine powder, to drink with water of Saxifrage, and thou shalt see thereof miracles. And if thou wilt help them that cannot make water, because of viscosity, give them our Aromatico, and annoint the reins with our Balsamo Ar|tificiato, and also his Testicles, and so by these means you shall help them quickly of that accident: as I have proved di|vers times. CHAP. LVI. Another discourse upon the retention of Urine; and his remedies. THe retention of Urine is caused divers wayes, as by over-much heat, or over-much cold, or through too much dri|nesse, or too much moistnesse. And therefore he that will cure this infirmity, must first know the cause, and also the vertue and quality of his Medicines wherewith he will cure them: for if he doe otherwise, he shall walk in the dark, and be as a Di|viner: for many have written receipts, wherewith they shew to help many infirmities, without giving any reason at all. But to the purpose of the retention of Urine, as as I have said, that it may come through four principall causes. So will I shew it in four Chapters, and also their remedies wherewith they may be helped. CHAP. LVII. Of the retention of Urine that cometh through heat, and his remedies. THe retention of Urine which cometh through heat, is that which ingendereth the stone and gravell, for through that superfluous heat it ingendereth. And this is one of the four causes of the retention of Urine, the which is helped with Instruments and Medicines concerning the stone. The most certain Medicine is, to be cut and take it forth. Neverthe|lesse, 46 there are many Medicines that may pleasure them of our invention: As concerning the gravell, there are many things that dissolve it, of the which I have spoken of in divers places: As concerning the remedy of the cause, that is easie: for by purging the stomack and the body, the heat will be dissolved, and the body left in good temperature. And the purging of the body shall be done with our Sirrup against the melan|choly humour, and to use our Aromatico, and Electuario Ma|gistrale, de Althea with Sulphur. And thus much concerning that heat. CHAP. LVIII. Of the retention of Urine through cause of drinesse, and his Me|dicine."},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"THe retention of Urine through drinesse, is, because the Reines and the Conduits where it passeth are to much dri|ed, and that drinesse is cause of adustion of the Liver, the which must be helped with taking away a little bloud: and to purge the body with Cassia, Sirrup de Pomis, de Succuria, de Lactutia, de Malvis, de Siterache, and such like, that cool and take away the adustion of the Liver: then annoint the Reines, the Members, and Yeard with Hogs grease, because that fat doth mollifie and moisten: and give him to drink Sero lactis, because that inlargeth and moisteneth, and provoketh Urine without burning. CHAP. LIX. Of the retention of Urine that cometh through cold, and his remedies. THe alteration of Urine that cometh through cold, is that kinde which maketh a man that he cannot make water, without the help of some warm thing laid upon the body, and upon the bottome of the belly, and the cure thereof is to vo|mit those cold humours out of the stomack, and to purge the 47 body with solutives of warm Nature, and with warm Decocti|ons, with the Decoction of Lignum Sanctum, of Carduus Be|nedictus, and of Rosemary, and annoynt the back with our Oleum Philosophorum, de Terebinthina, & Cera,, or Oyle of Frankincence, or such like things that warm the coldnesse. And so by these means the Patient shall be helped of that retention of Urine. CHAP. LX. Of the retention of Urine through cause of moistnesse, and his remedy. THe retention of Urine caused of humidity, is that which causeth the pores to swell through moistnesse, so that the Urine cannot passe, as those say, which are troubled with the carnosity: which carnosity is not alteration of the pores through cause of humidity. For the way to cure this kind of retention, is to purge the body with drying Medicines, as Turbite, Scamonie, Euforbium, Eleborus, and such like: and to use drying Unctions, as Unguento de Lithargirio, or Balsamo, water of Frankincence, Oleum Benedictum of our invention, and such like things, and then eat dry meats; and drink good Wine; and thus the humidity shall be dissolved: So that hereby every one may have the understanding of the cause, and the effect of the same, and the Medicines. CHAP. LXI. Of the difficulty of Urine, and of what it is caused, with the order to cure it. THere are divers kindes of difficulty of Urine, and are also caused of divers causes, as aforesaid, of the which one is caused of a corrupt humour of the French Pox, and this is one of the chiefest causes that may be in that matter. For we see manifestly, that the said kind of infirmity corrupteth the blood, ingendereth evill qualities in the Liver, and distem|pereth 48 all the body of those that are troubled therewith. Also we may see, that those which are infected with that kind"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"of disease, most commonly have Warts, or Carvoli, Pellaria, Botches, Scabs, Tumours, paines of the Stomack, in the Armes and Legs, with a number of other more strange ac|cidents that come through that disease, But when that in|firmity infecteth inwardly, it worketh these effects: It bring|eth Emeroides, paines in the Entrals, Fluxes of the body, continuall spitting, Gonorrea, or running of the Reines, such like effects. All the which cause difficulty of Urine, of the which difficulty, there useth to ingender the Stone, Gravell, Viscosity, Stitch in the side, and divers other mis|chiefs very hurtfull unto the body. The difficulty of Urine may also be caused of divers other infirmities, as of a rotten Catarre, descention of the head, of the evill quality of the Liver, and such like, as by excessive cold, or heat of the Reines, but let it be as it will, I know these are hard matters to be helped, because it behooveth certain manuall practise in that faculty, the which I cannot shew in writing: although I have great and high secrets for that indisposition, as con|cerning the Physick part, the which thou mayest find in di|vers places of my works. Neverthelesse, because I will not leave this Chapter unperfect, I will here name unto thee a most excellent rare man of that Profession, the which is both Doctor and Knight, and is most excellent in cutting out the Stone, and the Rupture, and can remedy the great difficulty of Urine, and heale the Rupture, and heale the in|firmities of the eyes, and such like things most excellently, and his name is called Prastecio Stelin Venetiano: the which is at this present dwelling in Venice. And this I have written of that Doctor, because he is one of the most excellent that may be found in that Art. 49 CHAP. LXII. To help those that have great burning of their Urine. THis infirmity may come of divers and sundry causes. Neverthelesse, I will treat of some of the principall, and of most importance; and also will shew the true order to help them with ease and brevitie. The first cause assigned by me is the Stone in the Bladder, and this is in a manner uncura|ble. The second cause is, the running of the Reins, the which is taken by companying with women corrupted with the Pox. The third cause is, the proper French Pox, the which is that kind that is called Gonorrea. The fourth kind is a certain corruption that is called Stranguria, the which moveth conti|nually to make water. The fifth cause is the Gravell: there are also other causes, as scorching in the Yeard, carnositie, and such like things, the which I will leave for troubling of the Reader. The first cause which is the Stone, is helped by two remedies, the one is with cutting and taking it forth of the bladder, the other remedie is written in this book. The reme|die for that which is caused by the running of the Reins, shall be to take three mornings our Aromatico, because it resol|veth that heat, and extinguisheth the burning. The remedie for that which is caused of Gonorrea, is none other then to cure the principall disease, and to annoint them with our Unguento magno, and perfume them, and so they shall remain whole. That which is caussed of the Strangurie, is cured by great purging, and by taking oftentimes our Aromatico. That which is caused of the Gravell, is cured by taking often|times our Electuario Angelica, and using to drinke Wine di|stilled with Cherrie stones, and Medler stones. That which cometh through carnositie, is cured with an Unguent made of oil of Sulphur, and Vitriol, Aqua reale, Oil of Fran|kincense, and new Wax, all Medicines devised by us, giving you charge, that before you"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"begin to cure them, to seek out the right cause from whence it proceedeth, and so thou shalt help it with brevitie and great ease. 50 CHAP. LXIII. A Discourse upon the carnositie in the Yeard, and the Order to cure it. ALthough we have something touched this Infirmitie be|fore in the Chapter of the burning of the Urine. Ne|verthelesse, in this place, I mean, something to discourse thereof, because that Chirurgions may not be void of such a noble Secret, to doe them honour in their cure of the like disease, for there are many troubled with that infirmitie: You shall understand, that this carnositie is an infirmitie whose originall dependeth of the corruption of the French-Pox, and to shew it plainer, it is an Ulcer in the neck of the bladder where the Urine entreth into the Yeard. And there|fore, if thou wilt help that infirmitie, cure the principall dis|ease, and the carnositie will heal; but if thou wilt cure them with the Candle, take that Unguent which is written for the carnositie in the Chapter of the burning of the Urine; but if thou wilt cure the principall disease, give him three times, Pil|lole aquilone, and then take our Sirrupo Solutivo, ten or twelve daies together; that being done, let him take twentie daies the Wine of Lignum Sanctum, written hereafter in this Book, and those which understand not this Chapter well, let him look over this Book, and he shall finde those Medicines with their Uses. CHAP. LXIIII. Another Cure for the said Carnositie. THat Carnositie which hindereth the Urine that it cannot come forth, is a certain kinde of matter that is ingende|red in the mouth of the bladder as is shewed before, the which is like in all points unto the Emeroids, that come in the neck of the Intestivall about the Fundament, and because it is a grosse matter and ulcerated, the Urine passeth with great difficultie, and great burning and pain unto those that are 51 troubled therewith, the which inconvenience if thou wilt help, it were necessary that the bodie were well purged, and that they keep a diet, and drinke the decoction of Hypericon, with a little Honie, and use to eat drie meats, and then make certain small long Candles with Wax, and Frankincense, like un|to searing Candles, then make this Unguent. Take red Lead, white Honie, of each an ounce, fresh Butter two ounces, white Wine as much as will suffice to incorporate all the aforesaid together in a liquid form, then boil it on a soft fire, and have readie ten or twelve quills fresh pulled out of the wing of a fat Pigeon; and note that when ye take them forth of the wing, that they may be full of blood in the ends, then take one of the quills and stir the said Unguent upon the fire continually while it boileth, and when one quill is dried take another, and so doe untill the wine be consumed, then take it from the fire and keep it, and when ye will occupie it, take one of those Candles, and upon the end put the said Un|guent, and put it into the Yeard untill it touch the carnosity, and this doe from time to time untill the Candle passe without pain, and then the Patient shall be whole; for this is a great Secret and hath been proved many times."},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":" CHAP. LXV. A Discourse as concerning those that cannot hold their water, and his Remedie. THis Impediment cometh of two principall causes, the one is, through heat and moisture of the bodie, and this is commonly in young children, which commonly doe be pisse themselves, because they are by Nature hot and moist. The other cause is through opening of the Pores where the Urine doth passe; the which are so stretched or opened, that they cannot retain the Urine, because the Urine is a voluntary motion, and a naturall motion together, they are hard to a|gree together, because the naturall motion maketh his volun|tarie motion; so that Nature first moveth the man, and there|of cometh the motion; for if a man would make water, and 52 that Nature doth not move the motion, he cannot pisse; for sometime Nature doth not give his naturall motion because of some impediment, for when a man cannot hold his water, it is a sign that Nature hath no retention; and to redresse the same, it were necessarie to reduce Nature into good tempe|rature, so that it may retain the Urine; the which thing thou shalt doe with purging the bodie, and the stomack wherein is the matter that causeth that retention of Urine. And to purge the bodie you shall use our Sirrup against the melancholy hu|mour: And to purge the stomack, you shall take our Electua|rio angelica, and to restrain the pores, you shall use the de|coction of wild Hysop, with the powder of Mastick, for you shall understand, that the purging taketh away the cause, and the decoction of Hysop with the Mastick, doth restrain the pores, and so by these meanes thou shalt remedie quick|ly that infirmitie. CHAP. LXVI. To break the Stone in the Bladder and also the Gravell, and to cause it to avoid by Urine. THere is found a certain bird called Solone, of Albertus Magnus in his Book of Secrets; the which birds are ve|ry plenteous in Rome, and are called Palmum bellae, and in Lumbardie, Sassarvoli, the which in English I suppose, is cal|led a Ring Dove, or Wood-colver, or the Stock Dove, which Birds are subject to the Stone, that if you keep them in a Cage, and feed them with such meat as they commonly use, being deprived of their medicine, within the space of four or six moneths at the most, there will ingender a Stone in the belly so great, that their meat cannot passe through them, and so choaketh them, and they die, and that is because the poor Bird cannot goe and help himself with that Medicine which Nature hath taught her. For those that are at libertie in the field, flie unto the Sea-side, and there they find a certain kind of small stone very hard, the which stone hath vertue to dis|solve the stone in the bodie of the Bird, and this Bird knoweth 53 it by the instinct of Nature, and eateth great abundance of them, and so dissolveth the stone in their bellies, and live a long time after it without any trouble of the Stone. You shall understand, that this stone is unpossible to be found in any other place, then in the belly of the said bird, because they are very little, and mans reason cannot discern them from other Stones, the which being beat in powder, with the flowers of Elders, and Cinnamon, of each a like, and given to drink with broth, in short time it will dissolve the Stone, and cause them to avoid it with"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"their Urine most miraculously: But if you ask me the reason, I know not what I shall answer, but I hold it to be his proper hidden qualitie and vertue. For truly this I have taught to many, and have seen the ex|perience thereof sundrie times, and it cured the most part that did use it. For truely the vertue of Stones are very great unto those that know them. I saw once two Stones in Rome of inestimable vertue; The one was a round Corall like unto the Serpentine Purphire, but therein was much green, and was of that vertue that being laid upon the flesh of a man or wo|man, it causeth them to pisse great abundance, so that it were to be wondred at. The other Stone was of Diasper, but bright and thorough shining with certain white veins, and was of such vertue, that being laid on a wound, presently the blood stench|ed so that there fell not down one drop, The which Stones were in the hand of an old Spaniard, who said, he brought them out of India, from Nova Hispania. I have seen also divers and sundry Stones of most strange vertues. You shall under|stand, that those Stones of the Bird must be gotten in this order. You shall get a number of the said Birds, and take the stones out of their bellies, and wash them clean, and keep them to thy use. The quantitie is as much as you can hold upon a Sixpence, as well of the Stones as of the other matters: You shall drinke the said quantitie seven or eight mornings together, and let your Diet be according, and drink good wine, and so in short time you shall be helped. 54 CHAP. LXVII. Of the Gravell in the Reins. THe Gravell (as is said before, is a disease of the Urine un|digested, which is caused of superfluous heat of the reins and blood, the which sometimes doth stay it self in the Con|duites, and causeth great pains; and sometimes it doth ingrosse so in the Bladder, that it letteth the Urine, and this is an evill disease to be troubled with, and the remedie is to purge often, and use that water against the Gravell that is written in my discourse of Chirurgerie, for it is one of the most excellent re|medies that can be found for that disease; and the order to use it is also written after the Receipt, and the best Purgation that you can use for that purpose is our Pillole Aquilone. CHAP. LXVIII. Of a certain Scab or Itch that cometh over all the bodie. THis Disease cometh in all places of the bodie, and in Na|ples it is called Prurito, and in Rome, Rosura; in Venice, Piz|za; and in Spain, Lomezon: And it is a salt humour that com|eth forth of the veins, and so disperseth through the whole bo|die between the flesh and the skin, and hath in it such an heat, that they cannot abide it, and is caused of alteration of the blood, the which is corrupted and distempered; and the reme|die is, to purge the stomack, and to purifie the blood, which thou shalt doe with giving them three times our Pillole aquilone every third day once; that being done, make this Bath: Take Nettles, Mallows, Pellitorie of the wall, Agrimonie, Sage, and Coleworts, ana. lb . iiii. the Bran of Wheat almost a peck, com|mon Ashes half as much: Mix them altogether in a great ket|tle of water, and let it boil an hour, and then take it from the fire and sit over it, and cover thee with clothes, that thou maiest sweat an hour, then dry thee with"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"warm clothes, and then wash all thy bodie with pure Aqua vitae, and this thou shalt use three times at the least, for the oftner the better, and so thou shalt be perfectly whole. 55 The Second Book of the Secrets of PHIORAVANTE. CHAP. I. What Chirurgery is. CHirurgery is a manuall Art, with the which the Chi|rurgian doth cure Wounds, Ulcers, and Impost|humes: And this was found of Husbandmen, and Experimenters of naturall things. For there is no Art in the world, that hath more need of the know|ledge of divers things then this Art. It is also necessary to the knowledge of naturall things belonging to Chirurgery, to have skill in Husbandry. It is also necessary to understand the Art of Painting, whereby you may set broken bones in their places, and to joyn or close wounds well. It were need|full also to have skill in the Art of Joyning, whereby he may make Instruments for broken bones in the Armes, or Legs, or Hands, or other parts. It would be also necessary to have the Art of a Smith, whereby he may make his Instruments. It is cheifly needfull to be expert in the Art of an Apothecary, to make his Unguents. And last of all, it is most necessary to know the Art of Alchimie, whereby he may distill his Oyles and Waters appertaining unto Chirurgery. Also it is ne|cessary to have a good judgement, and to help in all causes of Chirurgery, and to have a light hand in working. And when the Chirurgian is expert in all the aforesaid things, he may help without any suspition of any thing. And hereafter I will shew thee what Wounds, Ulcers, and Imposthumes are, and all other things appertaining to Chirurgery, and the order to cure them: a discourse grounded on true reason 56 and approved by experience, shewing to all men, which are the true and perfectest Medicines, and which are false and naught: writing and opening the true secrets of Chirurgery, with a new order found out by me, to exercise the same Chi|rurgery with more ease and brevity, so that every one may be satisfied: For they are true, and are Medicines, with the which thou mayest doe much good to the sick: and great honour will redound to the Chirurgian, if he use it accor|ding to our order: for they are Medicines proved of us infi|nite times in divers places of the world, as well in the Feilds as in the Cities, or on the waters· in the warres, where we healed Wounds, Gunshot, Ulcers, Imposthumes, and other diseases appertaining unto Chirurgery: and alwayes (thanks be un|to God) I have had good successe, as it is well known in most parts of Christendome. And so I make an end. CHAP. II. The order to be used in curing Imposthumes of divers sorts, taken forth of the short discourse of the Chirurgery of this Au|thor."},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"THere are divers kinds of Imposthumes that come unto mans body, and are caused of divers and sundry accidents, and therefore they must be cured in divers orders, and with sun|dry Medicines, according to his nature: for some Impost|humes are caused of contusions or bruised flesh: Some are certain humours, of which Nature would discharge her selfe, and so sendeth them forth: some are caused of cold; other|some are melancholy humours, and others are caused of the Pox: And these are the kinds of Imposthumes that most commonly doe come, and I will shew thee the order to cure them one by one, and then after I will speak of that sort which is caused of contusions, because it is bruised flesh: for every contusion doth putrifie and turn into matter, unto which it were necessary to lay Ma[...]ur[...]tives, and bring it to suppuration, and as soon as thou perceivest there to be any 57 matter, then presently launce it: and his Medicine shall be the yeolk of an Egge mixed with our Magno liquore, and with that dresse it as well within as without, without any other thing, for it will help any great Tumour: but you must make your Unguent fresh every day, and with new Egges. Further|more, as concerning those Imposthumes that come through the indisposition of Nature, and are certain Sborine (a word so called in Italian) by which Nature would prevail: and those would be left unto Nature, untill such time as they break alone, and then thou shalt dresse them with this Unguent. Take Oile of Roses {ounce}. vi. Litarge of gold finely ground, Tur|pentine, ana {ounce}. ii. Storax liquida {ounce}. i. New Wax {ounce}. iii. boyle them on a soft fire untill it be black, which if it be too hard, you may put thereto oyle of Roses, and make it in form of an Unguent, and therewith dresse those kinds of Imposthumes: and lay thereon the Cerotte of dia Palma, and so with these Medicines thou shalt work miracles. As concerning these Imposthumes that are caused of cold, you shall use hot Me|dicines and attractive, as the Cerotte called Oxicroxi, which is a perfect Medicine in these kinds of Imposthumes: also our Balsamo artificiato, and Aqua balsamo, and such like things which are by nature temperate hot, are very convenient. But those Imposthumes that have their originall of the French Pox, are evill and maligne, because their originall is maligne and evill. The cure of these is with great purging, and to let the Imposthume increase of it selfe, and when it is ready to launce, then launce it, and make this Medicine. Take Unguento magno {ounce}. ii. Magno liquore {ounce}. i. Precipitate di. {ounce}. mixe them well together, and therewith dresse the Imposthume, and lay thereon our Magistrale Cerotte, and it will be perfect whole in short time: Letting you to understand, that in all the aforesaid cures, if you will cure them perfectly, it were ne|cessary that the body were well purged of those corrupt hu|mours that hinder the cure, and to use defensives appropriate to that kind of Imposthume: as the oil of Frankincense, of Turpentine, of Wax, of Hony, Aqua vitae, and such like, which every one is a sufficient defensive, annointing it round about the Imposthume: And hereafter I will shew 58 thee the cure of these Imposthumes particularly by them|selves. CHAP. III. What Imposthumes are. IMposthumes are certain Tumours or swellings, that come in divers parts of the body: the which are caused of blood and choller putrified, which cannot passe through the pores, and therefore ingrosse in that place, and so cometh to putri|faction, and that is an Imposthume: which thou shalt help in this order. First purge the body to take away the humours which would goe to the Imposthume: which thou shalt doe with our Magistrale Sirrup, taking it eight dayes together:"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"that being done, give him our Aromatico: this being done, thou shalt quickly help the Imposthume, as I will shew thee hereafter, with their perfect cure. CHAP. IV. Of Imposthumes that come in the Groine. THe Imposthumes that come in the Groin are of three kinds, of which one is called in Venice, Pannochi, and at Rome, Tinconie, and at Naples, Dragonello, and in Spain, In|cordio. To these after the body is purged, as is aforesaid, you shall lay a Maturative plaister, the which is made thus. Take Marsh Mallowes, common Mallowes, the mother of Violets, the leaves of Coleworts, Wheat flower, Auxungia, Oil of Lillies, of each alike, and boyle them together, and then stamp them in form of an Ointment, and lay it on the Imposthume untill it look red and is soft, for then it [...]s apt to be launced: Giving you charge, that when you launce them you go not too deep; but onely that the matter may come forth, and then put therein a little tent, and annoint it with our Magno liquore, for because it is the best Medicine that can be found for wounds: for it mundifieth, incarnateth, and 59 siccatrizeth without any other help, and lay upon the Impo|sthume our Magistrale Cerot, and never change your Medi|cines untill you be whole; for this is the true secret found out by me to help these Imposthumes, which I have proved infinite times. CHAP. V. The second kind of Imposthume that cometh in the Groin. THe second kind of Imposthume in the Groin is called Glan|dulae, both this and the aforesaid are caused of humours infected with the Pox, and these Imposthumes seldome come to maturation; but if it doe, it will be long first, and it is evil to heal, because it requireth great cure and terrible medicines. But if thou wilt cure them perfectly, it were necessary to cure the principall cause, and that is the Pox. But when these Imposthumes are broke, the best remedie will be this. Take Waxe, Litarge of gold; Oil of Frankincense, ana. and boil them together untill it become black: and therewith dresse these Imposthumes, for this is a perfect remedie, and a great Secret. CHAP. VI. The third kind of Imposthume that cometh in the Groin. THe third kind of Imposthume that cometh in the Groin, is caused of much travell or heat of the blood, and these are called Anguinaglie, and they use to come with a great acci|dent of a Fever, cold and then hot, and in seven or eight daies at the most, they come to maturation, and then launce them, and his medicine shall be this: Take Turpentine well washed, the yolk of an Egg, and oyle of Roses, as much of the one, as of the other, and mix them well together, and with this"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"one|ly thou shalt help them, because it digesteth the Imposthume, and mundifieth and incarnateth with great speed; giving you 60 great charge that the bodie be well purged first with our Magi|strale Sirupe. CHAP. VII. Of Impostumes under the arms. THese Impostumes are caused of grosse and viscous hu|mours, the which Nature cannot digest by any other part, and these commonly are called Topinaxia, because they are like to a Molehill. And although this seem to be a great matter, yet it causeth little pain, and may be holpen with ease. First purge the bodie with Soluble Medicines, and then lay on this plaister untill it be ripe. Take grated bread, leaven of bread, Cow Milk, Oil of Lillies, ana, and boil them together and lay it on; for this hath vertue attractive and putrifactive, by meanes whereof it will bring it quickly to maturation; and when it is ripe, open it with a launce, and dresse it the first time with the white of an Egg and Salt beaten together with a tent, and lay on a stopine wet with the white of an Egg, the which thou shalt let lie at the least four and twentie hours, and then dresse it with digestive untill it be incarnated, and then lay thereon a plaister of Dia aquilone magno di Mesue, and so thou shalt help them quickly. CHAP. VIII. Of Impostumes in the throat. THese Impostumes are of divers and sundry kindes, as you may see by experience; for some are Scrophule, others are melancholie humours, others are caused of the Poxe, and o|thers are caused of heat, or of cold; the which are all cured sundrie wayes, as I will shew thee hereafter. 61 CHAP. IX. Of Impostumes in the throat caused of melancholie humours. THese Impostumes in throat caused of melancholie humours are hard and crude, and are long before they come to maturation, and you may not in any wise cut them, because the place is full of Muscles, Arteries, Vene capillari, Cartila|gines, Sinnews, and such like; the which although there come an Impostume there, it shall not hurt them; but if yee cut them with an Instrument you may offend them greatly, and for that cause you may not cut them by any means, but leave it unto Nature, the which will cause it to break, and then use this remedie. First, you shall take our Sirrup against the me|lancholie humour for twelve daies, continually in the morn|ing, fasting; that done, you shall give him our Pillole Aquilo|ne, and help the Impostumes with Unguento negro di Godfre|do di m[...]i, written in the Antidotary of Galen, Cap. 45. for that is miraculous to help those kinds of Impostumes, as I have proved it divers times."},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":" CHAP. X. Of Impostumes in the throat coming of the Pox. THe Impostumes that come in the Throat which are caused of the Pox, are commonly of evill qualitie, because they are much alterated, and cause great pain, and these likewise are dangerous to be cut for the aforesaid causes: but when they are broken, they goe creeping over the bodie, healing in one place, and breaking out in another, and these are evill to be helped, for them that know not the perfect secret, and the or|der to cure them is this. You shall give them eight or nine mornings our Soluble Sirrup; that being done, you shall give them our Aromatico twice, and then let them use Sarsa Pa|rilia, or our wine of Lignum vitae, and let them sweat ten or twelve daies together, and then perfume them with Sinabar, Myrrhe, and Olibanum, the which fume you shall 62 use onely at the mouth, and so thou shalt help any crude kind of Imposthume coming in the throat: for this Secret never faileth, as I have proved divers times. CHAP. XI. Of Imposthumes in the throat coming of hot humours. THese Imposthumes in the throat coming of superfluous heat, are caused of the bloud being alterated with heat, and be|cause of that alteration, it ingendereth gross vapours and vis|cous in Vena Capillari, the which through their grossnesse and want of digestion cannot dissolve, and so ingender that kind of Imposthume in the throat, because in that place there is much blood, and lesse flesh then in any other place, but yet these be not troublesome to help, and his cure is thus: You shall purge him with aperative things, and refriscative that purge the blood; and when the Imposthume is open, you shall dresse it with a digestive untill it be mundified, and then dresse it with Unguentum de Tutia untill it be siccatrized: Also you shall cause them to keep diet ordinary, and to drink no wine but onely this drinke: Take Citrake, Liver-wort, and Scolopendria, ana a handfull, Anniseed {ounce}. i. common white-Honey one pound, then put them all to infuse in four and twentie pound of fair water, and let it boil untill a third be consumed, and then strein it without expression, and keep it in a glasse close shut, and this shall be his common drink: but let him eat no salt, nor slimie meates in any wise, nei|ther Hogs flesh, nor other hot meats that may alter the blood: And this doing you shall be quickly helped, for the drink coo|leth the blood, and purgeth it, and helpeth the Liver of all in|firmities, as I have proved divers times. 63 CHAP. XII. Of Imposthumes in the throat caused of cold. IMposthumes in the throat caused of cold humours are small and without pain, and this goeth creeping by little and lit|tle untill such time as it breaketh of it self, and are an evill kind to help, because all Unguents are an enemie unto them, and all cold meats. Therefore if thou wilt help"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"them, let the Patient use twentie daies together our Quinta essentia soluti|va, which purgeth all cold humours, and warmeth the blood, and causeth the Imposthume to heal with ease; and when they are broken, you shall help them with our Balm artificiall, which doth subtiliate the humours, and mundifie the Impo|sthume, and incarnate and heal: And this Order of curing is effectual and of great profit for them that shall use them. And of this opinion are many excellent Physicians, and chief|ly M. Decio an ancient man, who hath been an experimenter a long time both in Physick and Chirurgerie, with a number of others, which I will leave to name untill another time. CHAP. XIII. Of Imposthumes in the throat coming of hot humours. THese Imposthumes coming in the throat of hot humours, is a kind that cometh with rednesse, and causeth great pain, with an accident of a Fever, and in short time they come to maturation, and break, and then the matter will come forth, and the pain will cease; and these kindes are not evill to heal, and the remedies are these. Assoon as they are broke thou must presse it out with thy hand, that being done, you shall have Oleum Benedictum of our invention, annointing the Im|posthume within, and lay thereon our Magistrale Cerot, and so thou shalt help those kindes of Imposthumes. For this is our Secret never written before of any man. 64 CHAP. XIV. Of Imposthumes in the Eies. IMposthumes in the eies are like certain white bladders that come about the nose, and the matter that is within them is like the white of an Egg, and these are caused of humiditie and moistness of the head, and because they have a confe|rence with the head, they are evill to heal, for they turn to watering Fistula's, which, when they come to Fistula's, con|tinue for ever. But if thou wilt cure them perfectly that they never come again, you must first purge the head with our Aromatico, and that you shall doe every five daies once for three or four times; that being done, thou shalt annoint the head with Oil of Frankincense the space of a moneth, and into the eie where the Imposthume is, thou shalt put once a day one drop of our Balm artificiall, which will help it and dry the Imposthume, and so in short time thou shalt be hel|ped. For this is the true Secret wherewith thou mayest help those Imposthumes, never known before of any man, and they are much contrary to the Medicines of Mesue, by which our Physicians now adaies make their Medicines. CHAP. XV. Of Imposthumes in the Eares."},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"IMposthumes in the eares are caused of cold and viscous humours, which ingrosse in that part of the bodie, and cause great pain untill such time as they are broken, and these Imposthumes are evill to heal. Neverthelesse, I will shew thee a Secret to take away the pains, and to help it quickly, and that is thus. There is found a certain kind of shell in the Sea, the which is of the length of an hand, and somewhat more, the which, in Venice, and in Istria, in Dalmatia, in Pu|glia, and in divers other places of the Adriatick Sea, are cal|led Asture, which is like unto a pair of bellows, the which hath a certain beard, like the hair of a mans head, and it 65 hath a certain attractive vertue, that if they put it into the eare, presently they take away the pain, though it be never so great or extream: the which vertue cometh through the saltnesse of it. For this I have proved divers times, and did learn it of our old Fishermen, which knew it by experience. But if it chance that one be troubled and cannot get that thing, they shall take Cantharides in powder, and put it into the eare, the which will work the same effect, because they be attractive and mundificative: And these are two naturall remedies, found out by true experience, and doth more good then any other that I could find. CHAP. XVI. Of Imposthumes in the Mouth. THese Imposthumes are of divers kinds, and may breed of divers causes: but let them come of what cause soever they will, they cause great pain to them that have them, for that they cannot swallow their meat without pain. And there|fore I will shew thee a generall cure for all Imposthumes in the mouth, and that is thus. You shall take our Pillole Aqui|lone twice: that being done, take our Aqua balsami, and hold it in your mouth as long as you can, and this doe three times in a day: then take the juyce of Beet roots {ounce}. i. oil of bitter Almonds {dram}. i. then snuffe it up at the nose untill it come into the throat: And thus doing, thou shalt help any Imposthume in the mouth, as I have proved divers times. For the Pils clense the head, and evacuate the stomack, and hindereth the alte|ration, the water of Balm doth cure and mittigateth the pain, and the juyce with the Oil mundifieth those secret places at the nose and mouth. CHAP. XXVII. Of Imposthumes in the Joynts. THese Imposthumes in the Joynts are evill, and of hard and crude digestion, because they are caused of great abun|dance 66 of grosse and viscous humours, the which through their grossenesse cannot passe the Joynts, and there remain and come to Imposthume, and these cause extream pain, because thereunto commeth great abundance of matter, and the re|medy is thus. First give him a generall purgation, and let him bloud on the common vein, and then lay on this plaister. Take Marsh Mallowes, common Mallowes, Pellitory, and the Mother of Violets, and boyle them in water till it be consu|med, then stamp them, and put thereto Leaven of bread, Barly flower, Hens greace, and Hogs greace, according to thy discretion, and set them on a small fire untill they be incor|porated, then lay this on once a day untill it be ripe, and when it is red and soft open it, and dresse it with our Magno liquore, and lay thereon our Magistrale Cerotte: and"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"so with these two thou shalt help them, except the Imposthume be of the Pox, for then it will doe small good. CHAP. XVIII. Of inward Imposthumes. THese Imposthumes inwardly are evill to know, and un|certain to cure, because the Patient himself cannot tell in what place they be, though he feel the pain: and there|fore all that we reason of in that matter, may be to the con|trary. For where a man cannot see with the eye, nor touch with the hand, the matter is doubtfull whether it be, or no[...] and therefore it is best to say little, For these Imposthumes may come of divers causes, and yet cannot tell of what cer|tain cause, and therefore you cannot know which is the true Medicine to help them: but by experience you may doe them some good; For (as I said before) Imposthumes never come but through distemperance of Nature, and alteration of the bloud. Therefore if thou wilt help them, help first the prin|cipall cause, then give them eight or ten mornings our Ma|gistrale Sirrup, and then take twice, our Aromatico: that being done, use morning and evening our Vegitabile Sirrup, and herewith thou shalt help them. 67 CHAP. XIX. Of Ulcers, and what they are. VLcers are of divers and sundry kinds, and are ingendered of many causes, as hereafter I will shew. But first I will write of those kinds of Ulcers that are caused of Wounds. You shall understand, that wounds in what part of the body so|ever they be, being imposthumated or cancrenated, they change their names, and are no more called wounds, although their originall was a wound. For when it is cancrenated, it is called Ulcera corrosiva, because it goeth eating and creeping on the flesh: but when the wound is imposthumated and full of matter, it is called Ulcera putrida, that is putrified, and it is because it is filthy and stinketh. But when it is neither can|crenated, nor yet aposthumated, but that through some evill disposition the wound is closed, and that there cometh in it evill qualities without alteration, then is it called Ulcera sor|dida, because therein is evill qualitie, and it appeareth but little, but it is evill to heal. There be other sorts of Ulcers also, which are caused of divers and sundry kinds of Tumours: and the most evill and mischeivious are those that are of Tumours caused of the Pox: for unto those there runne abun|dance of evill humours that augment the Ulcer, and they be the worst sort, for they cannot be healed by themselves, except the body be well purged and evacuated of all the humours that are offensive. There is another kinde of Ulcer that cometh of an Imposthume as well hot as cold, and those are more gentle and easie to be helped, if you know the Medi|cines that are apt to help and dissolve those kinds of Ulcers. These are the three kinds of Ulcers that commonly happen unto men and women through divers causes, as before is said, so that these are the principall causes of those maligne Ulcers."},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":" 68 CHAP. XX. To help Ulcers of all sorts. SEeing that Ulcers are of divers and sundry kinds, it were necessary to know of what kind and quality they are, so that thou mayst help them in form and order convenient. And first I will write of the corrosive Ulcers, as of a wound cancrenated, of Mal di formica, and of other sorts of Ulcers that goe creeping upon the flesh. The cure of these kinds of Ulcers is, to apply quickly our Caustick to mortifie the evill, which thou shalt doe thus. Wet a little Bumbast in our Caustick, and therewith wash all the sore, and then leave it so open four and twenty houres without binding it fast, and when four and twenty houres are past, wash the sore with strong Vineger, and water of a like quantity, with charge that there remain none of the Caustick in the sore: then lay there|on Butter washed with a Colewort leafe, untill the asker or dead flesh fall: then take our Cerot Magistrale, with a little Precipitate strewed thereon, and then annoint it with Magno liquore, and lay it upon the sore: for this Cerot helpeth all manner of corosive Ulcers without any other help, and every plaister will serve three or four dayes, taking them off every four and twenty houres, and making them clean, and then lay them on again. And as for the filthy Ulcer that I have shewed of in this Chapter, you shall dresse it onely with our Unguento magno, the which, without any other help, will heal them quick|ly. But you must every four dayes touch them with Aqua fortis drawn from Precipitate, which water draweth forth the offen|sive matter, and leaveth it purified and clean. And in all other sorts of Ulcers, our Balm artificiall, our Magno liquore, Oil of Wax, and Turpentine, the black Cerot of Godfredo di me di, our Cerot Magistrale with Precipitate, are able to help, be they never so evill. And hereafter I will write of Ulcers par|ticularly with their cures. 69 CHAP. XXI. Of Ulcers, that come in the feet, of corns, or of chaps. ULcers that come in the feet may come of divers causes, and are also of divers kinds, as of chaps, of corns, and such like. When they are chaps they come of an hot matter and fiery, as you may see by experience: For the Patient feeleth great heat in his feet, and is alwayes thirsty, the which giveth manifest signes that the humour is hot: and their cure is with cooling purgations, as our Sirrup against melancholy humours, taking it ten dayes together: then take our Pillole Aquilone twice, and so thou shalt take away the heat in the feet: and to help the crepature or chaps, make this Unguent. Take oil of Roses, Vineger, and liquid Pitch, ana, and boyle them untill the Vineger be consumed, and so being warm, wet a cloth therein, and lay it thereupon, and in short time it will be whole: but if they be cornes, you shall cut them unto the quick, and then lay thereon a cloth wet in Oleum benedictum, which doth comfort and dry, and quickly take away the pain. But when they are scratching, or as it were scorched, you shall lay thereon Unguento de Lithargiro crudo, and so thou shalt help them, as I have seen the experience."},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":" CHAP. XXII. Of Uleers in the Legs THese Ulcers in the Legs are of two kinds, that is, filthy, and corrosive. The filthy Ulcers are caused of cold and moist humours: The corrosive are caused of humours hot and dry: and these are those Ulcers that goe creeping in the flesh, healing in one place, and breaking out in another. The fil|thy Ulcer is stinking and full of matter, and causeth little pain, and their cure is with our Balm artificiall, which hath vertue to penetrate, digest, mundifie, and incarnate, and heal, when that the body is first well purged: but those that are caused of heat and drinesse, you shall cure with the remedy 70 written in the Chapter next abovesaid, and then dresse them with our Magistrale Cerot, and put thereon a little Precipitate, and annoint it with Magno liquore, and so thou shalt help them. But if so be it chance the said Medicine doe not heal it, you shall perfume them five times with Sinabar, Incense, and Myrrhe, and without all doubt thou shalt heal them. CHAP. XXIII. Of Ulcers that come in the Knees. THese Ulcers in the Knees are grosse humours that cannot passe by the Joynts downwards, and so remain in those places, and cause a fastidious Ulcer, which putteth the Patient to great paines, by reason of abundance of humours that cometh there. And the cure of this Imposthume ulcerated is thus, purge the body with our Soluble Sirrup, seven or eight mornings warme: and then give him di. {ounce}. of Electuaria An|gelica, and so thou shalt help them quickly: then dresse the Ulcer with Unguento magno, puting therein a little Precipitate and Magno liquore, and so in short time it will heal. CHAP. XXIV. Of Ulcers in the Groin. THese Ulcers for the most part are Tumours, or Botches, the which through the evill disposition of Nature, and evill Medicines are ulcerated. And of that may come many in|firmities, which I will leave to treat of at this time, and I will shew thee a remedy. Give the Patient seven or eight mor|nings our Soluble Sirrup cold, and then give him our Aroma|tico, and after let him use Lignum Sanctum according to our order, and dresse the Ulcer with this Unguent. Take Unguen|to magno {ounce}. ii. Magno liquore di. {ounce}. and common Precipitate {dram}. ii. Mix them well together, for this is the true secret of our in|vention, never made before of any man, the which I have proved infinite times. 71"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"CHAP. XXV. Of Ulcers in the Armes. THese Ulcers are not of so evill nature as those in the Legs, because thereunto come not so many humours, and these are commonly caused of the Pox, the Cure is this. Purge them well with our Magistrale Sirrup, seven or eight morn|ings together, then take Pillole Aquilone, and then annoint them with Unguento magno every night until the Ulcers remain whole and without pain. Thus have I used divers times. CHAP. XXVI. Of Ulcers that come in the Breast and Shoulders, and in the Back and Belly. ULcers that come in the foresaid parts, are all caused of Imposthumes of evill qualities, that have not been well healed of the Chirurgians, which knew not how to re|move the cause, and by that meanes the Imposthumes are be|come malign Ulcers. He therefore that will cure these Ulcers, it shall be necessarie for him to do that which was not done; that is, to remove the cause first, and then the cure will fol|low with more ease and speed, so there be good regard and consideration had thereof. And yet amongst Ulcers there is one kind that will receive no curation, and they are called Cancri, that are crude and of evill digestion, and go creep|ing along the flesh, and have a root as it were a Plant: And for those kinds there is found no better remedie to mit|tigate them, then is our Quinta essentia Vegitabile, for if you put it therein, and lay a cloth wet in the same thereon, it ta|keth away the pain, in such sort, that it is to be wondered at, and will not suffer it to putrifie; it taketh away the stinking, and comforteth the place very much. As concerning the other kind of Ulcer, you must first find out the cause before you can help it, and the cause being found, the cure is easie to find and sure. He therefore that will be diligent, shall not 72 onely heal those kindes of Ulcers, but also all other Ul|cers. CHAP. XXVII. Of Ulcers that come outwardly in all the bodie. THese Ulcers are a kind of fat sore that causeth abundance of matter, which cometh through superfluous humiditie of the bodie and blood, and these are evill to heal, because their Originall cometh of the inward parts, and the cure is thus: Give the Patient fourteen daies our Potion of Lignum Sanctum, the which is soluble and drying, and purgeth the blood, that being done, annoint the Ulcer with Unguentum de Lethargiro simple, and so they shall be helped perfectly. CHAP. XXVIII. Of Ulcers in the Head. ULcers in the Head are of divers kinds, as of Wounds, Con|tusions, Swellings, Scabs and white Skalls, and such like, which come of sundry causes, and are holpen divers wayes. For the"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"Wounds Ulcerated, are mortified with our Castick, laying it on four and twenty hours, and then wash it with strong Vinegar, untill all the Castick be come forth, and af|ter help it with our Magno liquore: The like cure is done in Contusions ulcerated, but the Swellings doe differ much, for that they are caused of the Pox, and thou shalt cure them with Soluble Medicines: Viz. Take Sarsa-Parilia, and then perfume him five or six times with Sinaber. The Scabs or Crusts are helped with taking three times our Electuario an|gelica, and then annoint them every night with Magno liquore. The white Scab is holpen with our Magistrale Ce|rot laying on Cantharides, and so let it lie three dayes, then take it off, and lay on another like the first, and let it lie other three daies, and then annoint the head with Oleum Benedictum continually. 73 CHAP. XXIX. Of Ulcers in the mouth, their Kinds and Remedies. ULcers that come in the mouth are of divers and sundry kinds, for some proceed of heat in the head, others of cold, others are humours Gallico. Those that come of heat in the head, are as it were scorched with great burn|ing within them, and the cure thereof is in letting blood in the veins under the tongue, and the next day give him one dose of our Electuario angelica, and let him wash his mouth with Planten water, wherein is boiled Tutia prepared, Roch Allum, and Honie of Roses, and this is the true order to cure those kind of Ulcers with speed. Those Ulcers which are cau|sed of cold, are a certain hardnesse alterated, which cause little pain; and the cure of these is to drinke our Vegitabi|le Quinta essentia, with Mel Rosarum: and dresse the Ulcer with Oil of Sulphur and Tartur mixed: And herein consist|eth a great Secret worthy to be known, and is of our inven|tion. Ulcers that are caused of Morbo Gallico, if you will cure them, you must first remove the cause, as I have said di|vers times, and touch them with our Castick. and let the Pati|ent hold his mouth open a good while after, that the Water may run out: And then make a Lavatory of Aqua vitae, Honey, and Oil of Vitriol, aad therewith wash the mouth, for these are great Secrets which bring both health to the Patient, and honour to the Professor of this Art. CHAP. XXX. Of Wounds and their kinds, and of their secret Remedies. VVOunds are of divers and sundry kinds. Neverthe|lesse, they consist in two, that is Simple, and Com|pound. The Simple wounds are those, where the flesh is one|ly offended. The Compound are those, where there is offence of flesh, sinews, veins, and bones, and the cure of either of them is in three manners. The first is a cure pertaining to 74 Nature and not to Art, and that is it which Dogs and other Animals doe use, who being wounded, use no other Medi|cine then to keep the wound clean with their proper tongues, and keep a Diet, and the rest is left unto Nature which wor|keth well without pains of Medicine, and this is the first. The second is that which is called Canonico, in which there be four operations. The first is, Digestion. The second, Mundification. The third, Incarnation. The fourth, Siccatri|sation. The third order is of our invention, and is done in this order, that is; Whensoever a man hath a wound either simple or compound, the first thing"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"that is to be done therein is, to joyn the parts close together, and stitch them, and dress them with divers sorts of drying Medicines, as I will shew thee hereafter in the cure of Wounds, in sundry parts of the bodie. CHAP. XXXI. What Medicines are fittest to heal Wounds outwardly with ease, and in short time. HAving declared alreadie what wounds are outwardly, it is necessary also to shew the true order to cure them with as much ease, and brevitie, as is possible to be done: And first, I will begin with simple wounds that are onely in the flesh, without offence of vein, sinew or bone. Although these sorts of wounds are not to be helped with artifice, but onely to joyn the parts together, and if it be necessary also to stitch them, and so leave it unto Nature, the which in short time will heal it, neverthelesse if thou wilt help it with arti|fice the faster, you shall annoint it once a day with oile of Frankincense made by Distillation, as is shewed in this Book. But those wounds where there are veins cut, have need to be succoured presently with ingenious artifice, and perfect Remedies to ease and heal them with the most speed that can be, because the veins may joyn together, without greater offence of the wound, and this Misterie thou shalt doe in this order: The first is to joyn the wound together quickly, and stitch 75 it close as they use to sow bags, and not to leave great wide stitches as they most commonly do; that being done, dresse it upon the wound with our Magno liquore, wetting therein a cloth, and laying it on as hot as you may suffer it, then strew thereupon our secret powder, and also round about it, for that subtiliateth the matter that runneth to the wound, and taketh it forth with great ease, and without pain of the wound, and therefore this is one of the most safest Remedies in that case, that Nature with Art can make, and hath been proved an infinite of times by me, and al|waies have had goodly experiences thereof. Also understand that these wounds, where the bones and sinews are cut, have need of great artifice, for they are of great importance. But when there is offence onely of the sinews, you shall stitch them presently, and doe as I have said before of veins that were cut, but dresse them not with Magno liquore, but in stead of that take Oleum Benedictum, and oil of Frankincense, of each alike, because these Oiles doe comfort marvellously those sinews that are cut. If it chance so, that a sinew had a puncture, or cut half away, in that case it is necessarie to cut it overthwart, lest it should bring a Spasm in the wound. But in case afterward that the bone be offended, and that there be some part to come forth, it were necessary to leave the wound open untill the bone be come forth, and then incar|nate it; and this thou shalt doe with our Balsamo Artificiato, and lay thereon the Cerot of Godfredo di medi, the which hel|peth with great speed. And this is the order wherewith thou mayest help all those sorts of wounds before named, and the defensive to use in these wounds is this. Take perfect Aqua vitae made of good Wine, and put therein Hypericon, Mille|folly, Viticella, Betonie, and with that Infusion wet clothes, and lay them for a defensive round about the wound, and thou shalt have good successe. Wounds in the head are hel|ped in the order, as those in whom the Sinews are offended. There are divers other sorts of wounds, which may be healed with the aforesaid remedies, as hereafter shall be shewed par|ticularly."},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":" 76 CHAP. XXXII. Of Wounds in the Head, with offence of the brain, and how to cure them. VVOunds in the head, where there is offence of the brain, are mortall: and there is no Physician that will take them in cure, but he counteth them dead men without any hope. But I by the grace of God and gift of Nature, have found the order to cure and heal them in short time. I re|member that when one was wounded in the head in the fa|mous Citie of Naples, yea, although the brain were not hurt, but that the skin were cut unto the bone, they counted him mortall, but I dressed them, and closed their wounds, and help|ed them in short space, so that they wondred thereat; and that order I used for the space of seven yeers that I tarried there, and caused them to walk in the streets, as it is well known unto all those that dwell there. And among a num|ber of other, I cured a Portingall that was called, Il Seignior Diego di mena, of whom I took away all the bone of the forehead, and every day he came to my lodging to be cu|red, which I did with great speed, so that it caused every one to marvell thereat. Afterward I went to Rome in the time of Pope Paulus the iiii. Carafa, and alwaies I cured in the same order, and did miracles, of which I call to testimonie the Romanes. And among the rest, I cured a certain Gentle|man called M. Alessandor (I cannot remember his Sirname) who was wounded in divers places, and I cured him quickly. After that I cured, and that in short time, a young man that was in manner cut in pieces, and of that M. Jacomo da Pe|rugia, M. Alessandro da Civita, M. Daltilo Hebraeo, all learned Doctors can testifie, for they were present. And such like cures I have alwaies done in Venice: But among the rest I will not leave to write of a great chance, the which is true, and is thus: There is in Venice a rare Poet and Orator and Hi|storiographer, well known unto the world called M. Dio|nigio Antanagi, who through his evill destinie was wounded in the head, so that it penetrated the flesh and the bone, and en|tred half a finger breadth into the brain, and there that ver|tuous 77 man fell to the ground as a dead man, and he lifted himself up to rise, but he could not, but fell down again, and there came a dimness over his eyes, with a vomiting and and a Fever, and the blood would not stint, and he lay in extream pains, which were all mortall signs: then I being called unto that cure, because he and I were of great fami|liaritie, and presently I shut the wound, and put therein our Aqua balsami, and I annointed all his head with our Balsamo artificiato; that being done, presently the blood stenched, and the pain went away, and the night after he took his rest, and in the morning the Fever was also gone: After that, I dres|sed him with Magno liquore, wetting clothes therein, and upon the cloth I strewed the powder of Hypericon: And this Medicine I used eight daies, in the which time he came forth of his bed; and shortly after he was perfectly whole, and be|fore six moneths were past, it was so siccatrized, that no man could perceive any wound. And of this I have to testimony Venice, Rome, Urbine, Caglie, and all Italy. To conclude this Chapter, I say, that wite the aforesaid order, thou mayest cure any such sort of wound. CHAP. XXXIII. Of Wounds in the Head, with Fracture of the Bone."},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"VVOunds in the Head, with Fracture of the bone, of the common Physicians and Chirurgians, are counted dif|ficile to be healed, because thereunto belongeth great art or cunning, for they open the flesh and raspe the bone, with ma|ny other things, of which here I account it superfluous to treat of, because that many be helped without them. For alwayes when the Physitian or Chirurgian, doth defend the wound from alteration and corruption, nature it self will work very well, and heal it without any other aid; but with our Me|dicines they may be helped with much more speed, because they let the alteration, and defendeth them from Putrifacti|on, and mittigateth the pain, and the order to cure those kinds of wounds is thus: The first thing that is to be done in those wounds is, to joyn the parts close together, and 78 dresse them upon the wound with our Oleum Benedictum, and upon the oile lay clothes wet in our Magno liquore, as hot as you may suffer it, and so with these Remedies thou shalt help them quickly, because our Oleum Benedictum taketh away the pains, and keepeth it from putrifaction, and repercusseth: Our Magno liquore digesteth, mundifieth, and incarnateth, and healeth. And therefore this is the best Medicine that can be used in these kinds of wounds. For hereof I have had an infinite of experiences, the which have been counted Miracles, and therefore I have let the world to understand thereof, that they may help themselves, if occasion shall serve; therefore he that will follow this our order in curing, shall work Miracles on the earth. CHAP. XXXIV. Of Wounds in the Head, where the bone is not offended. VVOunds in the head where the bone is not hurt, are not of so great Importance, but are easie to be helped; for you shall need to doe nothing, but to keep it from pu|trifaction, and defend it from inflammation, which are easie to be done, and so Nature will work well with great speed. To keep the wound from putrifaction, you shall annoint it round about with our Oleum Philosophorum de Terebinthina & Cera. And to keep it from Inflammation, you shall wash it with our Quintessence, and upon the wound dresse it with our Magno liquore. Thus doing thy cure shall prosper happily, and you shall not need to take away any blood, nor yet to keep any diet, nor yet to keep the house, but to goe where you thinke good, without any perill or danger. And this Order I have used a long time, as divers Cities can testifie. CHAP. XXXV. Of Contusions· or bruises, as well in the head, as other places. COntusions, or bruises in the head, or any other place of the body, of the antient Physitians hath been counted 79 dangerous to heal. For, they say, that Contusions must be brought to putrefaction, and turned into matter: which opi|nion I doe not allow: For by me those Contusions or bruises, are very easie to be dissolved without maturation: And that I doe with our Oleo benedicto, and Magno liquore, as much of the one as of the other mixt together, and made very hot as you may suffer it, and then wet clothes therein twice a day, and in three or four dayes at the most, they shall be resolved: and this it doth, because this remedy assubtiliateth the hu|mours, and openeth the pores, and draweth forth the matter that is runne unto the place offended, and so"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"by those means they shall be helped. With this remedy I have cured hun|dreds when I was in the warres in Africa, in Anno 1551. when the said City was taken and destroyed by the Camp of Charles the fifth Emperour. CHAP. XXXVI. Of Wounds in the neck, and the order to be used in curing them. VVOunds in the neck are very perilous, and hard to be cured, and long before they will heal: and this cometh because in it are all the ligaments of the head, as bones, sinewes, veins, flesh, and skin, all instruments that hold the head and the body together, without the which a man cannot live: and therefore those wounds are so perilous to be hea|led, seeing thereunto runneth so great quantity of humours, that they will not suffer the wound to be healed. The true way therefore to help these wounds, is to stitch them well in his place, and dresse it upon the wound with clothes wet in Oleum benedictum one part, and Magno liquore three parts mixt together, as hot as you can suffer it: and upon the cloth lay the powder of Mille folie: and this thou shalt doe once in four and twenty houres, and so thou shalt help them quickly; gi|ving you great charge, that you change not your Medicine, for this mundifieth, incarnateth, and healeth the wound with|out any further help: For I have proved it an infinite of times. 80 CHAP. XXXVII. Of wounds in the armes, and their importance, and Medi|cines. VVOunds in the armes are dangerous, for that there also are a great number of Sinewes, Cartiligines, Veines, Muskles, and other dangerous things, as it is well seen in wounds of the armes, how that many times thereunto run|neth abundance of humours, and there cometh alteration, inflammation, and imposthumation, which hurteth the Patient much. Therefore in this case, I will shew thee a rare secret, wherewith thou shalt help any sort of wound in the arme, without any alteration, and with little pain, and the secret is this: Dresse the wound upon the upper parts with our Magno liquore very warm, without any tenting at all: and this doe once a day and no more, and in any wise change not your Medicine: For with this thou mayest help all wounds in the armes with great speed: and it is one of the greatest secrets that can be used for wounds in the armes, and proved by me infinite times. CHAP. XXXVIII. Of Wounds in the breast, as well peircing through, as other. ALl wounds in the breast are troublesome, and very dan|gerous, as well they that peirce into the body, as others. And the cause is, for that the parts of the breast are compoun|ded of Skin, Cartilages, Sinewes, Flesh, and Bones. So that it cannot be but troublesome and perilous. For"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"where the sinew parts be hurt, there ariseth ever great pain, which for the most part bringeth Fevers, and other accidents, and there|fore is evill to cure. The cure of them is with our Balsamo and Quinta essentia. For the one taketh away the pain, and the other keepeth from alteration. But when they are peir|cing into the body, they are most dangerous, because the Chirurgian cannot tell certainly what part within the body 81 is offended or hurt. Either the Liver, or the Lungs, or the Milt, or any other particulars. Moreover, there is another matter which maketh it dangerous, which is, when they are penetrating, the matter that proceedeth from the Wound falleth into the body, as well as out. And remaining in the body causeth putrifaction, then Fevers follow, and commonly death. Wherefore in this case, cause the Patient to vomit, and to keep slender diet, because the humour should not alter to the dammage of the wounded. And to preserve him from putrifaction, you shall annoint all his body over with our Balsamo, and let him drink our Quintessence morning and evening. And this done the cure shall prosper, or else there is no hope by any other meanes. CHAP. XXXIX. Of Wounds in the belly, and in the reines, and their affects and Medicines. VVOunds in the belly are doubtfull, and very uncertain to cure, because it is unpossible to know how they are, or of what importance they be: for although yee may see the Orifice where the Weapon went in, yet yee cannot know what offence it hath done in the interiour parts, and therefore they are bard to be helped, and worse to judge of, and for that cause I will not stand long in reasoning thereof: for I have determined not to speak of things uncertain and doubtfull, but onely of things that may be proved by reason and ex|perience. And because those wounds be uncertain, I will write nothing of them, for fear of hiding the truth: but I will write of those in the reines or back, and first I will shew what the reines are, because every one may comprehend my reason. It is to be understood, that our bodies are made all of sensible things: as inwardly, the Stomack, the Heart, the Liver, the Lungs, the Belly, the Milt, the Guts, with a num|ber of other things which are not common, or known to all men, as those which I have spoken of. The rest of the man is made of Cartilagines, of Veines, of Muskles, of Flesh, 82 of Skin, and other particulars of small importance to know, because the wise, learned, and reverend, my Lord Canan Fer|rarese, hath writ thereof better then ever any in the world hath done, and therefore if you beleeve not me, beleeve his writing set forth in print. But to return to our purpose, I say, that God hath compounded the m[...]n naturally of all these things that I have spoken of: and because they are soft and tender, he hath placed the bones in the middest of them to strengthen them, and to keep them streight, &c. And from the shoulder to the thigh, he hath made a great pillar, of many peices of bones joyned together: On the one part whereof groweth the ribs, which holdeth the flesh, skin, and other particulars farre from the interiours: and upon that bone on the outward side, are the magistrall sinewes that de|scend from the head, and bind all the back together, and reach|eth down unto the feet. Therefore (this being true that I have said) wounds in the head are very dangerous in all his actions, and their cure very hard, because all those sences that give nourishment, passe by the reines downward to the lower parts: and most commonly when a man is wounded in those places, he remaineth lame on the leg that is on that part, and being, as it is, hard and dangerous, the cure of it, according to the Canons of the Ancients, is also perilous; because in those places where so many particulars doe meet and com|municate, there ought not"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"in any wise to be putrifaction, or digestion, but to preserve: You may not bring it to maturation, but to keep it from it; you may not incar|nate, but with speed heal it up: and so in this order the cure shall succeed well, and without danger. And this I will shew unto every one, because he shall profit by our doctrine to the glory of God, and health of the wounded. When one is wounded in those parts, I counsell that the Chirurgian pre|sently shall close the wound with all his diligence, putting thereupon of our Quinta essentia, and instead of a defensive our Balsamo, and upon the wound lay a cloth wet in our Magno liquore, and upon the cloth strew our secret powder for wounds, and following this order, he shall be reputed for an excellent Chirurgian above all other: and this is the meer 83 truth as by most evident proof thou shalt more largely find. CHAP. XL. Of Wounds in the Legs, and those parts. VVOunds in the Legs are in manner of the same qua|litie as those in the armes, because the Legs are of their proper qualitie and Nature compounded of the like substance that the Armes are, that is, skin, flesh, muskles, veins, sinews, and bones. And these when they are offended, or wounded, are very perilous, because unto them runneth great quan|titie of humours. And in the Legs are certain deadly places as a man may say: As the hinder part of the Caulf of the Leg: And the middle of the inner side of the thigh: The An|cle and the foot are all places troublesome and curious to heal, when they are wounded. And therefore to heal them ac|cording to the manner of the Ancients, it were great trouble to the Chirurgian, and pittie to see the pain of the Patient. Wherefore in no wise use not the Medicines of the Ancients, but when thou hast occasion, joyn unto the skill of thy Art, the use of these Medicines, our Quinta essentia, Balsamo, Mag|no Liquore, Oleo Benedicto, Oleo di Rasa, Oleo Philosophorum, any of these, or such like, which are incorruptible, which by their proper qualitie assubtiliateth contusions, pierceth to the bot|tome of Wounds, keepeth the flesh in his naturall caliditie and humiditie, preserveth from putrifaction, and naturally ma|keth the flesh to joyn and grow together, and that in short space. Therefore consider well which worketh better effect, ours or the Ancients: And use them at thy discretion. CHAP. XLI. Of wounds that pierce into the bodie, and of their danger. VVOunds that pierce into the bodie are very perilous and mortall, because the most part of them cannot be cured by ordinary means, and especially when the interiours are 84 ulcerated: In that case the Physitian not seeing it, nor know|ing the truth of the wound, cannot apply convenient Medi|cines, therefore he shall be much lesse apt to heal them, and therefore you must stand to the benefit of Fortune. And of this I will discourse nothing, for that it will be hard for me to shew that thing, that I cannot see with mine eies, nor touch with my hands: And because this discourse cannot be approved of the truth, and of experience, I will not meddle therewith in any wise: Neverthelesse, I will write of those sorts of wounds that are penetrative, and yet not offend the"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"Intrals, for those may be helped with ease, as I have cured a great number, and among the rest in Anno 1551. in the moneth of June (as I remember) the 17. day, being in the Armie of Naples to go to Africa, there happened a great chance which was thus: The Captain Generall of the Gallies of Fiorenza, named Il Seignior Giordano Orsino sitting at the Table with divers Captains and Gentlemen, among the rest there was one Captain falling in talk with another, sitting at the same Ta|ble, took a loafe of bread, and flang it at his face, then Seig|nior Giordano seeing that little respect of the Captain, rose from the Table and took him by the collar, and gave him five Stockadoes in the breast to have slain him, and left him ly|ing: That being done, the said Seignior Giordano repented him, and seeing that he was not yet dead, called for me be|ing in the Galley with Don Garsia de Toledo my General, and when I came, I found the poor Captain almost dead; whom I dressed with our Balsamo artificiato, and twice a day I gave him to drinke of our Quinta essentia, and gave him meats of good nourishment, and I never put tent into the wound, and in three daies he was helped, and of this the whole company, that was in the Gallie can testifie, and especially the said Seignior Giordano who did the fact. Then afterward in Af|frica I cured an infinite number that were wounded in di|vers manners. And of these Experiences I have done and do yet daily, in so much that if I should write of them, it would be tedious, and therefore I will stand no longer about matters concerning wounds, because I have written a Discourse upon Chirurgery, and Il Capricio Medicinale, in the which I have de|clared many things most profitable in the same. 85 CHAP. XLII. A Discourse upon old wounds which are not yet healed, with their Remedies. WHen that wounds are evill healed, and that therein cometh Imposthumation, and that the part wounded be indurated and full of pain. Then use this Secret of our Invention, which was never yet seen or heard of by the Ancients, nor yet in our time but of us. When thou findest such a case, wash the wound well, and make it clean round a|bout, and then wash it with our Quinta essentia Vegitabile, and bath it well through, for that the said Quintessence doth open the pores, and assubtiliateth the matter, and causeth the humour to come forth. This being done, annoint all over with our Magno liquore, and this doing, within three daies the Patient shall feel great ease, and in short time after he shall be whole. This is one of the noblest Medicines that can be made, for it taketh away the hardnesse, healeth the wound, and comforteth the place offended. CHAP. XLIII. A rare Secret to heal wounds of Gun-shot, Arrows or such like in the wars, when they require haste.

XLIV. To heal a Wound quickly. VVAsh the wound well with our Aqua Balsami, and close it up, and thereupon lay a cloth wet in the Oile of Frankincense, and so by this means thou shalt help any great wound quickly, for I have proved it infinite times, to my great honour. 86 CHAP. XLV. To help a Wound quickly, that is in danger of any accident. VVOunds in some parts of the bodie, are very dangerous of life, and specially where the sinews be cut or pierced, or veins or muskles hurt, or bones broken, and by an infinite of other particulars, which being open, or evill healed, the Patient may be in danger of life, because the winde entreth in, and they cause pains and inflammation, and therefore to avoid all these aforesaid matters, so that the wound shall have no detriment, use this remedy. First, joyn the parts close toge|ther, and put therein our Quintessence, and lay thereon a cloth, wet in our Balm, and bind it fast that the air get not in, for it is very hurtfull. Yee shall understand that these are two of the excellentest Medicines that may be found, because our Quintessence doth assubtiliate the bloud, and taketh it forth, and taketh away the pain, and the Balm doth warm and comfort the place offended, and will not suffer any matter to run thereunto by any means, for this is most true, as I have proved divers and sundry times, and alwaies have had good successe.

CHAP. I. In this third book is shewed the order to make divers Composi|tions, appertaining both to Physick and Chirurgery, with the hidden vertues of sundry Vegetables, Animals, and Mi|nerals, well approved by this Authour, and first of his Petra Philosophale, the which helpeth against all diseases that hap|peneth unto man and woman. THere hath alwayes been a great questioning among the Philosophers, whether that one Med[...]cine might help against all diseases or no. The which I af|firme, and will approve with sufficient reason, that the Petra Philosophale, made of our invention, may help against all the infirmities that cometh unto mans body· and two one|ly reasons I will shew thee with brevity: The first of them is this, that all sorts of infirmities have their originall and be|ginning of the Stomack, and to know the truth, yee may see manifestly, that if the body be never so little"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"infirmed, the stomack is also grieved: For yee may see how the Animals terestriall, never help themselves of other infirmity then of the stomack, and when they will help themselves, they eat hearbs, the which causeth them to vomit, and this doth signifie that they have no other infirmity, then the aforesaid; so by the experience of the Animals, I approve that the infirmity is caused of the stomack, and this is the first reason. The se|cond is, that all the Medicines, wherein our Petra Philosophale is put, as soon as they are come into the stomack, it draweth unto it all the evill humours of the stomack, and also of the 89 whole body, and mixeth with them, and so nature sendeth them forth by vomit, or by seege, or both, and so the stomack shall be evacuated of that matter, and the body remain free from all impediments of infirmities, so that by this reason I affirm, that our Petra Philosophale may help against all sorts of infirmities. And to know the truth, I have proved it by experience in all manner of infirmities, and alwayes have found it to doe much good unto all men, and hurt none unto my knowledge, and the order to make this Petra Philosophale, is thus. Take Sal Niter, roche Allome, Vitrioll Romain, of each two pound. First, dry the Vitrioll in an earthen pan, and then beat it to powder, and mix it with the other matters, and put there|unto four ounces of Sal Gemmae, then put it in a Goord with his head, and a Receiver well luted, and distill it in a wind furnace, so that yee may make fire with wood, and at the first make small fire, and so increase it according to Art, and al|wayes lay wet clothes on the Head and Receiver, and that thou shalt doe, because the spirits of the water shall not flie away. Yee shall understand, that in the beginning of your distillation, the Receiver will wax red like bloud, and then turn white, and at the last, when yee give it strong fire, it will turn red again, and those are the pure spirits of the Aqua fortis, and then at the end, the Receiver will turn white again, and then it is ended· then let it wax [...]old, and then keep it in a glasse close shut, to make our Petra Philosophale. Then take Mercury one pound, quick Lime {ounce}. vi. [...]ope {ounce}. iiii. common Ashe[...] {ounce}· [...]. Mix them together in a Mortar of stone, and then put them into a Retort [...] and distill it with a strong fire untill all the Mercury be come forth into the Receiver, then take it forth· and keep it in a glasse to make thy Com|position, the which is made thus· Take the water that thou m[...]dest first, and [...] a Goord of glasse being well luted, and then put in the Mercury that thou did[...]st distill before. After that take S[...]l in thin plates {ounce} i. Iron also in thin plates {ounce}. ii. Fine gold in leaves, the weight of [...]. ii. and put them altogether in the glasse, and 90 presently set on the Head, for it will begin to boil, and cause red fumes like bloud, the which thou shalt receive in a Re|ceiver, and presently set thy glasse in the Furnace, and give it fire untill all the water be come forth with the fume. Then let it cool, and keep that close in a glasse, then break that other glasse that stood in the fire, and in the bottome thou shalt find our Petra Philosophale, the which thou shalt grinde fine, and searce it into most fine powder, and then wash it well with Vinegar distilled, and drie it again, and at the last wash it with Rosewater, and drie it very well, stirring it continu|ally over the fire, then keep it as a precious Jewell close in a Glasse. For the order to use it, I will write hereafter in sundry pla|ces: Yee shall understand, that the water which ye distilled away from the stone; will serve for the same purpose again: But yee"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"must take but halfe the quantity of the aforesaid mat|ters, and when yee have distilled it again from the stone, yee shall preserve it for an infinite number of purposes, as I will shew thee hereafter. CHAP. II. To make our Balm artificiall, with the order to use it, and where|fore it serveth. THis Balsamum hath all the vertues of the naturall Balm, although not in quality, yet in vertue, and the order to make it is thus. Take Veni[...]e Turpentine one pound, Oil of Bayes that is perfect without mixture {ounce}. iiii. Galbanum {ounce}. iii. Gumme A|rabie {ounce}. iiii. Olibanum, Mirrba elect, Gumme Hedera, of each {ounce}. iii. Lignum Alloes, Galingall, Cloves, Consolida minore, Ci|namon, Nutmegs, Zedoaria, Ginger, Diptamum album, of each {ounce}. i. Musk of Levant, Ambergriece, of each {dram}. i. Beate all those aforesaid things together, and put them into a Retort of glasse well luted, and put thereto six pound of rectified Aqua vitae without flegme, and so let it stand eight dayes, and then distill it by Sand, and there will come forth a white water 91 mixed with Oil, and so keep thy fire small, untill there come forth a blackish Oil, then change thy Receiver, and set thereto another, and increase thy fire untill all the spirits be come forth, then seperate the Oyle from the black water, and keep them by themselves, and the like shall yee doe by the first water. The first water that is white, is called Aqua del Bal|samo, and the Oil seperated from that, is called Oleum del Bal|samo. The second water that is black, is called Mater Bal|sami, and the Oil seperated from that water, is called Balsamo artificiato, the which would be kept as a precious Jewell. The first water is most excellent to clear and preserve the sight of the eyes, also the face being washed therewith, it ma|keth it very fair, and preserveth it youthfully, it keepeth back age, it breaketh the gravell in the reines, and provoketh Urine, the which is stopped through carnositie, it helpeth all manner of wounds, in what place of the body soever they be, if yee wash them with the said water, and wet therein clouts and lay thereon, for his operation is so strange, that it seemeth rather divine then humane. It helpeth much against the Etisie, and against all sorts of Catarres, and Cough. If yee wash a Sciatica therewith, and lay thereon a cloth wet in the same, it taketh away the pain presently. The other water called the Mother of Balm, helpeth Scabs in short time, if yee wash them therewith: so doth it help the white Scall, Lepra, and all sorts of Ulcers that are not corrosive, most miraculously to see, and without any trouble. It serveth also against a number of other infirmities, the which I will let passe at this time. The Oil of Balm doth serve for an infinite number of things, and especially for wounds in the head, where the bone and pannicle is hurt, putting it therein. It preserveth the face if yee annoint it therewith. It is most excellent against the Plurisie, giving thereof {dram}. i. at a time with the water of Balme."},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"The Balm artificiall is a miraculous liquour, for if any have the stitch in the side, and take {dram}. ii. thereof, it presently will help him. It is also good against the Cough, and Catarre, and coldnesse in the head and stomack, and for wounds in the 92 head. It is a most Soveraign remedie, if ye annoint all the head therewith once a day, because it pierceth into the brain, and also unto the stomacke beneath. It resolveth a Quartan in short time, if ye annoint all the bodie therewith, leaving no part. And to be short, I know no disease, neither hot, nor yet cold, but that this Balsamum doth good unto, as well the hot diseases as the cold, because it cooleth the hot and heateth the cold, and this it doth by his qualitie and hidden vertue, so that I have found in this precious liquor, such great vertues, that I am not able to declare them all; so that every one, the which is furnished with this precious Balm, may be kept from infirmities, and shall not need to seek the naturall Balm, with so much expences, and danger of the life, as hath been ma|ny times seen. CHAP. III. To make our Aromatico, the which helpeth against all manner of infirmities, of what qualitie soever they be. ARomatico Leonardo, is so called, because it was compoun|ded and made by his invention, and is a miraculous Me|dicine, that serveth against all manner of diseases, of what qua|litie soever they be, for it worketh this operation, that is, assoon as it joyneth to the stomack, it draweth to it all the evill humours of the bodie, and imbraceth them, and carrieth them forth by vomit and seege, and so leaveth Nature unbur|dened, the which may prevail to his pleasure because it hath no impediment, and by this reason I approve that our Aro|matico helpeth against all diseases; as is said before, and the order to make it is thus. Take fine Sugar {ounce}. iiii. pure Pearls, Muske, Saffron, Lignum Aloes, Cinnamon, ana. {scruple}. i. Petra Philosophale, {dram}. iiii. mix them together, and make thereof Lozanges with Rosewater accord|ing to Art, the which ye shall keep in a box of wood close shut, and the order to use it is thus, that when the Physician doth go to visit any sick person, and that he will prepare him some Medicine to take inward, the best and most perfect 93 Medicine that he can ordain is our Aromatico, because it eva|cuateth the stomack by vomit, and the bodie downward, and his operation is such, that it doth in manner help any crude sort of infirmitie, and the quantitie is from i. {dram}. to ii. and may he taken in broth, in wine, in water, or mix it with any Pils, or Potion, giving you charge, that when ye put it in any Po|tion, that ye leave none in the bottome of the cup where yee drinke it out, because the Petra Philosophale, is heavie, and will remain in the bottome, for if that remain it will not work at all, giving you also charge, that the said day that ye give this Medicine, that ye let the Patients drinke as much crude wa|ter as they will, and give them little meat to eat that day, and this is the order to use this Medicine. CHAP. IIII. To make our Electuario Angelico, and the order to use it, and in what diseases."},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"ELectuario, Angelico Romano is so called, because it was com|pounded of me in the Citie of Rome, in the time of the Pope Paulo quarto, and because this composition worketh di|vinely, I called it Angelico, and is most excellent against ma|ny diseases, it is good against all sorts of Fevers, giving it Per-minorativo, and for the Stitch in the side it is most rare, because it taketh away the viscositie in the Stomack, and ope|neth the Pores, and is good against the Gout; for if they take it every third day once, in ten daies they shall be hel|ped.

CHAP. V. Our Sirrup Solutivo, with the Order to use it. SOluble Sirrups made in decoction are very wholsome and of great facultie, and specially in the crudity of humours, and the reason is this, because it disperseth the matter, and evacuateth it with great ease, and without danger or trouble of the Patient, and the order to make it is thus. Take Sage, Rew, Rosemary, Wormwood, Cicorie, Carduus Sanctus, Nettles, Organie, of each a handfull; Figs, Raisons, Dates, sweet Almonds, Sal gem. ana {ounce}. iiii. Coloquintida, Aloes he|patica, Cinnamon, Mirabolani citrini, ana {ounce}. ii. common Honey two pound, stamp them all grosly, and put them to infuse in eighteen pound of fair water, then boil it till half be consumed, then strain it, and distill it by a filter, and aromatise it with two carets of Musk, and a pint of Rosewater, and then it is made, the which ye shall keep in a bottle of glasse close stopt, the quantity is from {ounce}. iiii. to {ounce}. vi. In Winter you shall take it very warm, and in the Spring and Autumn, ye shall take it but warm. In Summer ye shall take it cold, for this purgeth the gross humours of the bodie, and hurteth not the sto|mack, you may use it in a Fever four or five daies together, and it will help it. In cruditie of humours, as the French Pox, Gouts, Catarrs, Doglie Artetich, and such like matters, where there is no accident of Fever, ye may take it ten or fifteen daies together, and cannot hurt by any meanes, for it purgeth most excellent; it is given against the Cough, against Flux of of the Urine, and pains in the head, and carnositie in the 95 Yeard, for the Emeroids; and in sum, it is good against all diseases c[...]ed of corrupt humours, for it hath such vertue, that it draw[...] from all parts, and evacuateth the humours in|testinall, for of this Sirrup I have had great experience, in such persons as were in manner banished and had"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"lost their taste, and presently using this, they came to their good tempera[...], and I have used it an infinite number of times in persons that were ulcerated, and full of sores, evill handled of Fortune, and of the infirmitie, and finding no meanes to cure them as they should be: I gave them this Sirrup fourteen or fifteen daies, and then they were cured, with a number of other things, the which would be too long to write, and there|fore I would wish every one to use this, not onely in the afore|sad matters, but in all other diseases.

It helpeth those 96 much that have Pellaria, Scabs, Emeroids, and such like dis|eases, and may be given unto a woman with child, without any danger, when shee shall have occasion to use any. CHAP. VII. Our Sirrup against the melancholy humour, and specially where there is ventositie in the Stomack. IT were necessary for those that will make this Sirrup, to be expert in the Art, for it would be made with great di|ligence, and the order to make is thus: Take water of Fumitorie, of Hops, of Wormwood, of Mai|den-hair, of each five pound. Then with this water thou shalt make a decoction with these things that follow. Take Pollipodium of the Oak, one pound, Sine leaves, Epi|timum, ana {ounce}. iiii.

CHAP. VIII. Our Potion of Lignum Sanctum, the which is miraculous to dis|solve crude, and ma[...]ign humours, with the order to use it, in the French Pox, and such like diseases. BEcause the Poxe is a disease contagious, putrified, and cor|rupt, and worketh many evill Effects, as I have written in my Caprici Medicinali. Therefore it were necessary to pre|pare 97 most excellent and rare Remedies to dissolve the same, which Medicines are infinite. But in this Chapter I will write one, that purgeth the crude and viscous humours downwards, and doth assubtiliate the grosse humours, and drieth all sorts of subtill humours that offend Nature, and sendeth them forth by sweat: It drieth the melancholie humour, and dissolveth choler, and is most wholesome for those that are troubled with that disease, be|cause it drieth much and dissolveth the disease, with many other good effects, as by experience thou mayest see, and the order to make it is thus. Take the Bark of Lignum Sanctum grossely beaten one pound, and lay it in steep in fourteen pound of fair water, 24 hours, then boil it untill four pound be consumed, then put thereto Pollipodie of the Oak, {ounce}. ii Cicory one handfull, Aloes hepatica, {dram}. iiii. and let them boil for an hour, and put thereunto the leaves of Sine, Epitimum, ana {ounce}. i. Coloquintida, {dram}. vi. Sugar {ounce}. viii. then let it boil till half be boyled away, and that there remain vii. pound, then strein it, and put it in a glasse with xii. grains of Musk, and keep it very close stopt, and this is the Sirrup, the which ye shall take twice a day, that is morning and evening; then make this drink following, the which shall be the common drink at all times to your meat. Take a pound of Lignum Sanctum, Raspead, and steep it in ten pound of white wine that is ripe, and let it boil an hour, then put thereto fifteen pound of fair water, and let it boil a little more, and then strein it, and keep it in a glasse bottle, for this is to be used all the day time, and the order to use these is thus. First, when any feeleth himself grieved with the Pox, or a|ny such like disease, he must keep his bed at least twentie daies, and use to take of the first Sirrup or Potion every mor|ning a good draught, being as warm as he may suffer it, then cover him well with clothes that he may sweat as much as he can, then take off the clothes by little and little, and drie him with warm clothes, and so let him repose for two hours, and then let him eat, and his meat must be dry, as Bisket, Rostmeat, Rai|sins of the Sun, Almonds, and sometime a rere Egg, and his drink at meals, and all the day beside, shall be the last made 98 with wine and water: then at night give him of the first Sir|rup as yee did in the morning, and cause him to sweat, and then drie him: and this order thou"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"shalt use twenty dayes together, not coming forth of thy Chamber, and by the grace of God thou shalt be helped of any such greivous in|firmity, as I have seen the experienee thereof an infinite of times, to my great honour, for it may be occupied in all complexions with safety, as by the Ingredients thou mayest see. CHAP. IX. To make the water of Lignum Sanctum, most wholsome against the Pox, with a new order. COmmonly they use to take the water of Lignum Sanctum against the Pox, the which surely is most wholesome, but it must be taken in good order and form, and must be made with great discretion, and not as they use it now adayes, for they give it some three or four times, and never the better, although the wood be sufficient enough to help them, and therefore I would wish every one that will use this water, to take it in such order as it ought to be, the which I will shew thee hereafter. Take Lignum Sanctum, Raspead small one pound, the bark being beaten {ounce}. iii. infuse them in twelve pound of fair wa|ter one night, and the next morning put therein one pound of Honey, the which is put in, because it is aperative and warm, and helpeth to provoke sweat, and causeth it to have a good taste: then boil it till half be consumed, then put thereto Carduus sanctus {ounce}. iiii. strong Wine three pound, then boil it untill a third part be consumed, and then it is made; then strain it, and take forth the Carduus sanctus, and put therein twenty pound of fair water, and one pound of Hony, and let it boil untill four pounds be consumed, then strein it and keep it in a glasse bottle, for this is the common drink to drink all the day long, and the order to take it is thus. First before yee will take this water, it were necessary to take our Sirrupo 99 Solutivo seven or eight dayes, after that take of our Electuario Angelica {ounce}. ss. That being done, in the name of God take this potion of Lignum sanctum in this order. Take in the morning at the appearing of the day {ounce}. viii. very warm as he may suffer, and presently lay clothes on him, and cause him to sweat two hours, and then dry him with warm clothes, and so let him remain two hours, and then give him to eat, and his meat shall be Bisket, Raisins, Almonds, and sometime a little roast meat, and no other: then in the evening about the 22. hour, yee shall give him the said Sirrup as yee did in the morning, neither more nor lesse, and cause him to sweat, and about the 24. hour give him onely Bisket and Raisins, and the other common drink that was made last, giving you warning that yee make this drink fresh every third day, be|cause it shall not hurt the stomack, and every week once, yee shall take a pill of Marte millitare, and that day thou shalt eat Birds flesh because of weakening: Also ye shall take very great heed to one thing, and that is this. If it happen, that at the beginning of this cure there cometh a Fever, or other accident unto the Patient, that in any wise yee leave not the cure, but follow the order, for that is a certain sign of health: for many times I have given this water, and unto some in the fourth or fifth day the Fever came, and tarried many times ten or twelve dayes, and then the Fever went away with the corrupt disease, and all for company, and so in short time they were cured, so that, as I have said before, when that signe appeareth and is delivered, it is a certain signe of health: Also I will advise thee of another thing, and that is this: If the Patient cannot sweat yee shall annoint him all over with the Oil of Quinces, the which shall cause him to"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"sweat apace; for without sweat the cure will not be perfect, and this order thou shalt keep, at the least forty dayes together within thy Chamber, so that there come no air in, for it will hinder the cure. 100 CHAP. X. An Electuary that helpeth the Cough with great speed and ease. THe Cough is caused of a Catarrous humour, and coldnesse of the stomack, and therefore if yee will help it, it were necessary to have a remedy that doth ripen the Catarre, and mollifie the stomack, and the order to make it is thus. Take Enula Campana {ounce}. iiii. Marsh Mallowes {ounce}. xii. Quin|ces {ounce}. xvi. But if yee cannot get Quinces, yee may take Mar|malade ready made, and boil it in fair water with the said roots untill they be dry, then stamp them in a morter, and strein them through a streiner, then take for every pound of that matter two pound of white Hony, and boil them to|gether, but boil them not too much: then take it from the fire, and put thereunto for every pound of the aforesaid mat|ter {scruple}. i. of Saffron, and {dram}. i. of Cinamon, and {ounce}. ii. of Sul|phur, and {scruple}. i. of Licorice, and then incorporate them well together, and aromatise it with musk and Rosewater, and this yee shall use morning and evening, for this is of so great ver|tue, that it is to be wondred at, because the Mallowes doe mollifie, the Enula Campana doth warm, and causeth digesti|on, and comforteth the Stomack: the Quinces are cordiall and warm, the Sulphur is a great drier, the which destroyeth the evill humours of the body, the Saffron comforteth the heart, the Cinamon is stomackall, the Licorice is mollificative, and digesteth the matter: so that of force this Electuary must help any kind of Cough, except it come of the Pox, for then it will doe small pleasure· as I have proved. CHAP. XI. Our Magistrall Electuary of Sulphur, the which serveth against divers sorts of infirmities. AS the fire hath vertue to heat and dry materiall things: so hath the Sulphur vertue to warm and to dry the humi|dity 101 and coldnesse of our bodies, for I have occupied it di|vers and sundry times, and alwayes have seen divers and sun|dry good effects, but for the better commodity, and more ease to use it, I have compounded this Electuary, the which thou mayest use with ease and benefit unto a number, and the order to make it is thus. Take very fine Sulphur that is without earth, and make it into fine powder one pound, Cinamon {ounce}. ss. Saffron {scruple}. i. Gin|ger {dram}. ii. Musk dissolved in Rosewater two Carets, white Hony crude, as much as will suffice to make it into an Electuary without fire, then keep it in a dry place; and this ye shall use in the morning fasting, and his quantity from four drachms to seven, This dryeth up Scabs, provoketh Urine, breaketh the stone in the Reins, it helpeth the"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"Cough, dryeth up the watering of the eyes, causeth a good appetite, with divers other things, the which I will leave to the Experimentors. CHAP. XII. Our electuary of Consolida majore, that serveth for many dis|eases inwardly. THis Consolida majore, is a hearb so called, because of his effect that it doth in healing of wounds, and other places of the flesh separated, for if yee eat thereof it will help the Rupture, and all sorts of Wounds penetrating, and Ulcers of the Lungs, it dryeth the Milt, and such like effects: but because thou mayest use it more commodious, I have compounded an Electuary, the which is excellent and rare, and is made thus. Take the root of Consolida majore one pound, and boil it in water untill the water be consumed, then stamp them in a Morter, and passe them through a Streiner, then put thereto as much white Hony as the matter weigheth, and boil them on a small fire, untill it be come to the form of an Electuary, and when it is boiled, put thereto these things. Take the Rindes of Pomgranates in fine powder {ounce}. i. Lig|num aloes {dram}. vi. Mirrh, Mastick, Sarcocolla, Sanguis draconis 102 in grain, ana. {dram}. ii. Cinnamon, {dram}. i. Musk of Levant dissolved in Rosewater, one Carret, then incorporate them well while it be warm: You must note, that the bodie must first be well purged, ere ye take this Electuarie, and ye must also keep a diet, that the Medicine may work the better, for this helpeth all the aforesaid disease inwardly, as is said before: You may use it emplaister wise upon the wounds, and on broken bones, and use it inwardly, and so the Patient shall remain helped. With this I have seen men of great age helped, that were burst below, and wounded from one part to the other, and also broken bones and bruises, the which if I should write them, it would not bee credited. CHAP. XIII. Unguento magno Leonardo. THis Unguento magno is so called, by reason of his great vertue and operation, for it worketh so strange in some diseases, that it in manner reviveth the Patient, and the order to make it is thus. Take Otnegra oviv. {ounce}. vi. Oximel Squilliticum, {ounce}. ss. mix them together in an earthen dish, untill the Otnegra oviv. be become like ashes, then it is deisitrom, then put therein {ounce}. ii. of Vi|negar, and wash it well, untill it remain pure and clear, then take Olibanum {ounce}. ss. Cerusae {ounce}. i. Beat them fine, and mix it in a stone Morter, with as much Magno liquore, as will serve to incorporate them well, then put thereto the Otnegra oviv. and mix them very well together, that being done, put thereto Auxungia porcina, {ounce}. viii. And mix them very well together, and then it is made, the which keep in a vessell well glased, for it will keep a long time without corruption, and is apt to help those that are lame, full of pains, and sores and swel|lings, pains of the eyes, the stone in the reins, and such like matters, it helpeth all"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"mannes of French Pox, if ye annoint them therewith, untill the Gums be sore and then leave. But ye shall note, that the bodie must first be well purged before ye annoint them. This Unguent cooleth all corrosive Ulcers, 103 and helpeth them in short time, it helpeth all paines in the eyes, if ye put it therein; and taketh away all burning with speed. And to be short, it helpeth those diseases in most short time, so that it is to be wondered at. CHAP. XIV. Oyle of Hypericon, the which is most miraculous, for Wounds and bruises. THis Oyle of Hypericon compounded by us, is of great ver|tue in divers and sundry accidents, and specially in wounds, for it helpeth them without any pain, although the veins, sinews, or bones were hurt or cut, and that in very short time: It preserveth the wound from corruption, and taketh away the pain, and incarnateth and cicatrizeth, as by experience thou mayest plainly see. It dissolveth Contusions, and is most marvellous agaist poison. It helpeth against any crude sort of venemous Fever, if you annoint all the bodie therewith, leaving no part; and the order to make it is thus. Take the floures, leaves, and seed, of Saint Johns-wort, as many as ye will, and stamp them together, and put them in a Glasse, with as much strong white wine as will cover it well, then set it in the Sun ten daies together, then put thereto as much pure Sallet oile, as the herbs and the wine doth weigh, then let it stand in the Sun other ten daies, giving you warn|ing that you weigh your oyle before you mixe them; that be|ing done, put thereunto for every pound of oyle {ounce}. ii. of Tur|pentine, and {dram}. i. of Saffron, of Nutmegs, Cloves, Myrrha elect. of each {ounce}. ss. Frankincense {ounce}. i. Viticella {ounce}. ii. for every pound, stamp them altogether, and put them into a great glasse, and set it to boil in Balneo Mariae, with a head and Receiver close shut, and to know when it is boyled enough, is, that there will ascend no more vapours into the head, and that will be within 24. hours, or thereabout, then take forth the Glasse being yet hot, and strain it, and keep it in a Glasse close shut as a precious Jewell. Ye shall note that this Oyle must alwaies be occupied very warm, and in any wise [...]ent no 104 wound, but wet clothes therein, and lay it thereon, and thy cure shall prosper well, for this I have proved a thousand times in divers places. CHAP. XV. To make our Oleum Benedictum, the which healeth wounds divinely. THis Oleum Benedictum serveth chiefly for wounds in all parts of the bodie, and especially for wounds in the head: If there were fracture of bone, and offences of the Pannicle, and in other places where sinews were hurt, or muskles, or veins, or in any other noble place of the bodie, with this Oleum Benedictum, and with our Vegitable Quintessence, thou mayest help them easily, and in short time, without any dan|ger or detriment of the wounded person, as is said before, and the order to make it is thus."},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"Take the whites of Eggs being hard sod in water, {ounce}. xii. Clear Turpentine {ounce} xiiii. Pure Myrrh {dram}. iii. Mixe them, and put it into a Retort of glasse, and give it gentle fire at the first, and then increase it according to Art, untill all the sub|stance be come forth of the Retort, the which will be both water and oyle, the which separate, and keep the Oile by it self in a Glasse as a precious Jewell, for this worketh miracles in wounds of what sort soever they be. Moreover, it causeth hair to grow on the head or beard, the which were fallen away, and that it doth in short time by the onely annointing the place therewith. Also if any have a stitch in his side, and retention of Urine, let him take a Glister, wherein he shall put a little of this Oyle, and he shall be helped; and this effect it doth, because it dri|eth mightily that alteration made in the secret parts of the Reins inwardly, where no locall Medicine can be applyed. CHAP. XVI. Oleum Philosophorum de Terementina & Cera. THis Oyle of Turpentine and Waxe, is a most precious Balm, and his vertues are infinite, because it is made of 105 simples in manner uncorruptible, and is most miraculous for those that are corrupted, or strucken with the Pestilence, be|cause it is most penetrative, and of nature drying, and com|forteth all weak parts in mans bodie, of what infirmitie so ever they be, and the order to make it is thus. Take new yellow waxe, {ounce}. xii. clear Turpentine, {ounce}. xviii. Ben|jamine, {ounce}. ii. Fine rectified Aqua vitae, {ounce}. xxx. common ashes, {ounce}. vi. mixe them, and put them into a Retort of glasse well lu|ted, and then distill it in a winde Furnace, untill the sustance be come forth, and in the Receiver thou shalt find three things: The first is Water, the second Oil, the third flegm, the which thou shalt separate one from another, and keep them close stopt in a glasse, the which is most excellent in time of the Pestilence, as well for unction, as for to help the sores, for if you put it into a sore or botch that is broke, presently it ta|keth away the pain, and being mixed with other of our Medicines, as I have shewed in my Regiment of the Pesti|lence, it helpeth them with great speed. If any annoint all his bodie with this Oyle twise a moneth, it will preserve him youthfull, and in health a long time, it preserveth also dead flesh or fish, that is put therein from corruption. Also if any be wounded in any part of the bodie, let him annoint it with this Oyle four or five times, and it shall be whole: Also if any cannot make water, give unto him {dram}. ii. of this oyle to drinke, and presently he shall make water. It is also good a|gainst the Stitch in the side and Plurisie, and Worms, and the Cough and Catarre, and against the Pestilent Fever, and such like indispositions, if ye drinke a little thereof; it hath a number of other vertues, the which I will leave unto the Experimentors.

THe Pine is a tree, the which by nature is uncorruptible, and the gum that runs from it is of great vertue and strength, because it preserveth those things wherein it is put, and when 110 his Elements are separated out of that Gum, the Physician may work strange things therewith, against most part of in|firmities that happen unto mans bodie, if he apply them where they are convenient: For the water being drunke help|eth winde in the stomack: Also it helpeth the white Skall, and all such like scabs, if ye wash them therewith morning and evening.

The aire helpeth much in wounds in any part of the bodie, because it preserveth the flesh from putrifact|ion, and keepeth it from alteration, and taketh away the paine and healeth the sore: Also it preserveth the face if it be annoin|ted therewith.

Ye shall understand, that these are great secrets of importance, the which I have revealed of this Gumme, and happy shall he be that useth them in the time of need: And the order to make this Oile is thus.

Ye shall under|stand that this Oyle is best fresh, for when it is old, it will waxe thick, and cannot pierce so well. CHAP. XXIII. Of the Oyle of Honie, and the order to make it. THat which most men call Oyle of Honey, is not an Un|ctous Oyle like unto other Oyles, but rather a certain 111 Element, the which is neither oyle nor water, although it be clear, and this serveth not much in Chirurgery, because it is not convenient in sores, but much rather it is a perfect re|medie in things appertaining to Physick, because it comfort|eth the Stomack, and fortifieth the vertue, and extinguisheth all sorts of Fevers. It helpeth the Collick, it dissolveth the Stone in the Reins, and provoketh Urine, and also maketh the hair yellow as gold, if ye wash it therewith, and the order to make it is thus. Take pure Honey two pound, and put it into a Retort of glasse, that holdeth at the least fifteen or twentie pounds, and set it in a Furnace, and give it a fire of the second degree, and first there will come forth a clear white water, and when it changeth colour, change the receiver, and give it strong fire untill all the fumes be come forth, the which is the Oile, and that keep by it self as a precious Balm against malign Infirmities that are cured with Physick.

A Magistrall Cerot of our Invention against the white Scall. THis Cerot is of great vertue, and of marvellous experience, to resolve the white Scall, because it is penetrative, mun|dificative, and resolutive, and causeth the hair to grow that is fallen away, to the great content of the Patient and ho|nour of the Physician, and it is made in this otder. Take Frankincense that is strained from his filth, what quantitie you will, and distill it in a Retort, and give it fire at the least fortie hours, then let it cool and break the glasse, and in the bottome thou shalt finde a black mase, the which make into powder, then for every pound of the said pow|der, put thereto one ounce of Waxe, and four ounces of the said oyle that ye distilled, and half an ounce of the heads of Bees, the which are easie to be had in Summer: Mix all the aforesaid things in a Vessell of Copper, and with a small fire make them in form of a liquid Unguent, and when thou wilt 113 use it, shave the head, and wash it, and lay thereon this Cerot upon a fair cloth warm, and every two days change it, and so in short time thou shalt see strange effects of his vertue, as I have done divers and sundry times to my great honour. This serveth also against breaking of bones, dislocations, and for Scabs ulcerated, because it drieth, and comforteth, and resolveth all the evill qualities; giving you charge in the distilling, because the fire many times consumeth it so, that in the bottome there remaineth nothing that good is, and therefore beware in the making.

XXVIII. To make a miraculous Emplaister for Flegmon, or Erisi|pella. THis Flegmon or inflammation, called Saint Anthonies fire, is a tumour caused of the alteration of the bloud, by rea|son of superfluous heat, and this most commonly cometh unto Cholerick and Sanguine bodies, that are full of flesh, and have much bloud: And the Erisipella is caused of a windy humidity, and of a hot humour, and to shew it, yee may see how that Flegmon is no other then bloud that runneth to the place offended: And when it cannot find way to resolve, it putrifieth and turneth into Sanius matter, so that by this yee may see that to be true which I have said. Also Erisipella is a wind hot and moist, for when it cometh to suppuration, then cometh forth nothing but wind and water, and this is the true proof by demonstration, and therefore seeing that these two infirmities are in a manner alike, or little differing: this Medicine shall be appropriate as well to the one as to the other, because it resolveth and cooleth, and the order to make it is thus. Take fine Clay that hath no stones nor gravell in it, and searce it very fine, and put it in a pot, and for every pound thereof put thereto {ounce}. iii. of Oil of Frankincense, that cometh forth last in the distillation, and as much of our Quintessence as will serve to make it in form of a liquid Unguent, and this yee must mix without fire, and then lay it upon a cloth, and warm it over the fire a little, and lay it upon the Flegmon, or Erisipella, but first ere yee use this remedy unto those that have Flegmon, yee shall give them a dose of our Electuario Angelica, and in Erisipella give them a dose of our Aromatico, and so thou shalt help them perfectly, as I have proved divers times, and may be used although yee take no bloud; but if yee take bloud, let it be in augmentu, and not in statu, nor in declinatione, because it would so weaken Nature, that afterward it cannot defend it self to drive forth the humour peccant, that is cause of the disease. 115 CHAP.

It helpeth any crude kinde of scab or sore that is caused of the evill qualitie of Nature. CHAP. XXXII. A strange composition of great vertue. THis Composition is divine in his operation, because it healeth many indispositions in our bodies, when it is applied rightly, and the order to make it is thus."},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"Take water of Carduus Sanctus one pound, Oyle of Hon|nie, one ounce, oyle of Sulphur, {dram}. ss.

CHAP. XXXIII. To make an Unguent of great Vertue against Ulcers. THis Unguent hath a great vertue in healing all sores that are putrified and corrosive, except they be Cankers or Noli me tangere, the which are counted among the uncurable 117 cures: But when they are other sores, this will heal them quickly, and the order to make it is thus. Take a good quantity of Calex vivae, and put it into a great Tub, and cover it with water four fingers high, and stir it well together, then let it settle, and thereon will come a thin scum the which ye shall gather together with a Scummer, and keep it untill ye have sufficient quantitie, then take oyle of Linseed, oyle of Nuts, oyle of Almonds, and of the said scum that is gathered, of each one pound, then distill it in a Retort, untill all the substance be come forth, then separate the oyle from the water, and then make this composition. Take of the said oyle distilled one pound, Tallow such as they make candles of, Hogs grease, new Wax, Mercurie preci|pitate of each two ounces, fine Aqua vitae iii. ounces, mix them all together in a Copper pan on a soft fire, untill the Aqua vi|tae be consumed, and that it remain a liquid Unguent, then take it forth, and keep it in a close vessell, that it take no ayre: and this ye shall apply cold unto Ulcers, upon a fine linnen cloth, for first it doth mundifie, and then incarnate, and last siccatrize, it helpeth sores, scabs, scrophule, mall de Formica Se|tole on the Nipples of womens breasts, Emeroids, pains in the privie members, and such like, for it is temperate. CHAP. XXXIV. A Discourse upon sundry sorts of Unguents, and their quali|ties. THere are many sorts of Unguents that are found out, of which I beleeve that many Chirurgians are greatly abused of their operation, but for that which I doe finde, that some sorts of Unguents are occupied for one effect, and they work another; as for example, Unguento Camphorato which many doe occupie to cool hot sores, in stead of cooling heat|eth them more then they were before, which cometh by means of the Camphire which is a hot substance, as I will prove by sufficient reason that it cannot be denied. For you shall un|derstand, that into Unguento Camphorato, is put Camphire and 116 [...] 117 [...] 118 oyle, both hot materials, as for"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"experience: Take Cam|phire and lay it by the fire, or set it nigh a candle, and thou shalt perceive, that assoon as it feeleth the heat, it will flie into the fire and burn fiercely; and the like will the Oyle do; for if you wet a cloth therein and hold it over the fire, present|ly it will burn, which are manifest signs that they be both hot, becuse they are friends unto the fire; whereas if they were cold and moist, the fire would not burn them with such force. As for example, take water, earth, stones, and mettals that are cold and moist, and lay them on the fire, and you shall see that the flame of a candle shall not be able to kindle the fire with such ease as it doth with the Camphire and oyle. So that you may see that Camphire and Oyle are hot and friends unto the fire which is most hot, and earth, stones, and mettalls, are moist and cold, and are enemies unto the fire, and therefore I conclude, that Unguento Camphorato is very hot, and cannot by any meanes cool hot Ulcers. Also Un|guentum Apostolorum is a composition in which there is put Verdigriece, a materiall which is most enemie unto the sore, for laying it thereto causeth great pain, as you may under|stand of those that have proved it, and in my judgement this is no Unguent to be laid on a sore, because they cannot suffer it, neither is it possible to heal the sore with that Un|guent, for that it corrodeth the flesh and will not let it heal. Also Unguento de minio is a mixture not very profitable for Ulcers, because it is too much drying; for applying it unto a sore that is not mundified, it drieth it in Superficie, so that if Na|ture send humours unto those parts, and they find no exha|lation or vent by reason of that drying, it will cause the ga|thering of abundance of humours, and be a means of greater mischief: But if the sore be well mundified and cleansed, you shall have little need of that Unguent, because Nature will doe it alone without any other help, so that this Unguent is of small profit to be used of any. But to the contrary, there are many sorts of Unguents which are most necessary to dresse sores, as Unguento di Rasino, which by his Nature is friendly to the sore, because it mundifieth and healeth, help|ing Nature that it may work with greater speed. The Dia|chilone 119 commune is also an Unguent very profitable to mundi+fie or purge sores, and likewise to siccatrize them. The Un|guent of Litarge is refriscative and drying, and healeth scabs, and cooleth the heat of the flesh alterated. Unguento Rosato doth mittigate the pains of foul Scabs. And thus discoursing from time to time, there are many sorts of Unguents very hurt|full, and not to be used, and also there are many sorts that are wholesome and good, without which in a manner they can|not work. Neverthelesse, it were necessary to know how and where to apply them rightly. CHAP. XXXV. Medicines appropriate against all kindes of Poysons, as well Ve|getables as Minerals. THere are an infinite number of Poysons, and they are dif|fering in their operation, but yet they work in manner one effect, as you may see by experience in those that are poysoned, for after that they be dead, they are swollen and become black, and in their Stomack is abundance of aquosi|tie: And the cause is this, that if a poyson have power to kill or strangle a man or woman, of necessitie it must be cor|rosive, and being corrosive, it will work this effect, that is, assoon as it arriveth at the stomack, it beginneth to make al|teration and quickly congealeth the blood, and enflameth the parts round about it, it draweth unto it great quantitie of water; and it causeth the congelation of the blood on the one part, and the inflammation of the stomack on the other part, and the gathering of the water on the other part. And in a manner all poisons work one effect,"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"and there are great num|ber of these Poisons, of which I would shew their qualities, but that I fear I should cause such as are ignorant to know them, and therefore I leave them. But I will write the order where|with thou shalt help all those poysons that are curable, with as much facilitie as is possible. Poysons, as I said before, do work three evill Effects, they inflame the stomack, congeal the blood, and draw unto them great quantity of water, which three 120 things being in a man killeth him out of hand; and the ne|cessariest cure in that matter of poyson is this. First cause the poysoned person to vomit so much as he can, and as soon as he can, and that thou shalt doe with {ounce}. ss. of our Electuario Angelica, which provoketh vomit, and evacuateth the stomack of the poyson, and of the matter drawn by the poyson into the stomack, and it is excellent against all kind of poysons; that being done, annoint all his body with our Balsamo arti|ficiato, the which will keep the bloud liquid, and will not suffer it to congeal by any meanes: after that let him take every morning {dram}. iii, of our Pills against poyson, which are written in my discourse upon Chirurgery; and when he hath taken those Pills, let him drink thereon a little good wine: and after let him drink the decoction of Diptamo bianco, and dresse his meat with hearbs that are good against poyson, as there are a great number: And this doing, by the help of God thou shalt help all those that are curable, for it is a rationall Medicine and experimented, which worketh incredible ope|rations. CHAP. XXXVI. A water that preserveth the Face and Teeth. THis water is miraculous, for if yee wash the face therewith, and rub the teeth, it will make the face shining and bright, and the teeth like fine Ivory, and the order to make it is thus. Take Mother of Pearl in powder one pound, the juyce of Lemmons pressed with their pills and all three pound, put them in a glasse, and let it stand fifteen dayes, then put thereto so much strong distilled Vineger as there was of the juyce, and distill it in a Retort of glasse, with a small fire, untill the spirits doe appear, then presently change thy Receiver, and keep it, wherewith thou shalt wash thy face and rub thy teeth: Note, that when yee will occupie that water, it were necessary that the face were washed so clean as is possible, and to rub the teeth with a clean cloth, for with this I have seen many goodly experiences in those matters. 121 CHAP. XXXVII. To Clarifie and take away spots out of the Face. TAke Lac virginis two parts, pure Oil of Tartar one part, fine Aqua vitae six parts, mix them, and when thou goest to bed annoint thy face therewith, and in the morning wash thy face with the decoction of Bran, and dry it well, then annoint it with the Oil of Almonds, and so using this order, in short time thy face will be bright and clear without any spot. For this Composition is of marvellous vertue to pre|serve the flesh, and to defend it from all impediments of Na|ture, and preserveth the head from many infirmities."},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":" CHAP. XXXVIII. The order to make a goodly Remedy, to cause the hair to grow. THe beard and hair commonly doe fall through two causes, the one is, when the Patient hath a Pestilent Fever, that is, Mal di Mazzucco, for when they are cured, all their hair will fall away, and many times most of them doe change that sub|tile skin, called of the Doctors Epiderma, and this is one of the causes: The other cause is, when they accompany with un|clean women, and that they get those Carvoli on the Yeard, the which as soon as they are cured, there cometh an altera|tion in the throat, so that they cannot well eat their meat, then after that in short time the hair will begin to fall, and these are the two causes of falling of the hair. In that which commeth after Mal di Mazzucco, ye shall need nothing else but to annoint the head when yee goe to bed, with our Oleum Philosophorum a little warm, and that will cause the hair to grow, restore the sight and hearing, the which those commonly doe lose when they are sick, through their long sicknesse. But when the hair doth fall through the other cause, yee must use forcible Medicines to cause it to come again, and that thou shalt doe with this Cerot. Take Turpentine, Ship-pitch, Rosin of the Pine tree, and new Wax, and make thereof a 122 Cerot, the which spread upon a cloth, and strew thereon Can|tharides in powder, then lay it upon the head, and there let it remain five dayes without moving it, and when yee take it away, take Magno liquore, and our Oleum Philosophorum, of each alike, and therewith annoint the head once a day very hot. And while yee use this Unction, take Sinaber {ounce}. i. Olibanum, Mirrh, and Colles, of each two scruples, and grinde them to|gether, and divide them in six parts, and every night when yee goe to bed, perfume the bed with one of these parts, the which thou shalt doe in this order: Take Coals in a Chafing-dish, and cast it therein by little and little, and then cover thy head with a cloth, and receive the fume, and then goe to bed with the said cloth about thy head, and this thou shalt doe six evenings, and continually use the Unction untill it be helped, the which will be in short time. CHAP. XXXIX. To make our Sirrup of Bayes. THis Sirrup being well made, is of marvellous vertue for those women that are troubled with pains of the Mother, and pains caused of wind and cold, because the Bayes of their nature are hot and drying, and resolveth the wind, and warm|eth the cold, and drieth the humidity, so that whosoever doth use this Sirrup oftentimes, shall be free from the stitch in the side, and gravell in the Reins, because it doth mundifie the Reins, and resolve the humour hanging, and therefore this would be used in Polonia, and Almaign with great profit, because those Countries are cold, and they feed on most meats which are contrary to those aforesaid infirmities, and the order to make it is thus. Take a branch of Bayes weighing one pound, and put it in a glasse with eight pound of white Wine, and two pound of purified Hony, and distill it in Bal|neo three hours, then take it from the fire, and keep that by it self, then take that which remained in the glasse, and distill it by a filter three or four times untill it be clear, then take two pound of Sugar, and clarifie it with the white of an Egge, 123 and then mix it with that which yee distilled by a filter, and give it a little"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"walme or two, but not too much, then when it is boyled, before it be cold, put therein the said water that yee distilled in Balneo, and aromatise it with six graines of Musk, and {scruple}. i. of Cloves, and another of Saffron, and {dram}. ss. of Cinamon, and {ounce}. iii. of Rosewater, and then keep it in a glasse close stopped, and it will preserve a long time: The dose of this Sirrup is from {ounce}. i. to {ounce}. ii. and no more.

The order to make a Sirrup of Cinnamon and Ginger. THis Sirrup is exceeding hot, and preserveth a weak sto|mack through cold, resolveth the Cough, and the Catarre caused through want of naturall heat: but yee shall note, that if the indisposition were of a hot and dry cause, in any wise ye shall not use this. It causeth digestion, and provoketh venereous acts, and killeth many that oppresse themselves therewith, for they will doe more then Nature is able to carry, and so fall into a disease called Apoplexia, and die, or else live with great pain; and therefore I would wish those that have no great need thereof, not to use it for Lechery sake, for better it were to leave it in Vase spermatico, but as for those that have need thereof, it will revive them if they were in a manner dead, and the order to make it is thus. Take Ginger, Cinnamon, of each one pound, beat them in powder, and infuse it in half a pound of Rosewater, and there let it remain four or five daies, and then put thereon {ounce}. iiii. of the water of a Herb called Mortella, in the Italian tongue, and six pound of the best white wine, and distill them altogether untill all the substance be come forth; then take as much white Honey as the matter purified weigheth, and while it is yet hot on the fire, put therein the said Water which 124 you distilled, and six grains of Musk powdred with Sugar, and incorporate them well together, and keep it in a glasse close shut, and when ye will use this, ye shall take it in the morning warm, fasting thereon four or five hours, because it may pierce the better, and doe his operation; the quantitie that you shall take ordinary is {ounce}. i. but if it doe not work his operation well, augment the quantitie, and take somewhat more or lesse ac|cording to thy stomack, and the time shall be two or three weeks, or more or lesse, according as thou feelest thy self, for it is of so much vertue that it will not be credited, except it be of those that have seen the experience thereof, there|fore keep it as a thing of value.

THis Sirrup is a restorative of great vertue, never seen or heard of before, and is of such vertue that it is able to su|stain a sick person many dayes without taking any other meat, because it is of flesh and blood, for the flesh sustain|eth the flesh, and the blood sustaineth the blood, and the or|der to make it is thus."},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"Take a great fat Capon that is well-fleshed, and pull it while it is alive, and take forth onely the gutts and the belly, and when he is dead, stamp it in a Morter grossely, and put it in a distilling glasse with twentie pound of good white wine, and {ounce}. ss. of Salt, and four ounces of Sugar, and {ounce}. ss. of Cin|namon, then distill it in Balneo untill the two thirds be con|sumed, then keep that which is distilled, and that which re|mained in the glasse strain through a cloth, and presse out all the juyce of the flesh with a Presse, then passe all that through a filter, and then with Sugar make it in form of a Sirrup, but boil it not too much, then put therein that which ye distilled from the Capon, and aromatise it with Cinnamon half a dram, Saffron one scruple, Musk four grains, Rosewater {ounce}. ii. then keep it in a glasse close stopped, and this hath no dose, be|cause it is taken onely to sustain a weak nature; you may put 125 it in broth, or in any other meats, or by it self, and alwaies it will work his operation, in strengthening those that are weak.

THis Sirrup of Quinces is of great vertue, because it resto|reth strength, helpeth digestion, comforteth the Stomack, and maketh the heart merrie, as you may see by the Ingre|dients; it comforteth also the sight, and quickeneth the me|morie: And the order to make it is thus. Take of the best Quinces you can find, and cut them in small peeces, with seed and all three pound, Cinnamon half an ounce, Cloves, Saffron, of each a scruple, Lignum Aloes, {ounce} i. ss. Bengewine {ounce}. i. stamp all these and infuse them in seven pound of strong white wine, then distill it in Balneo, untill all the li|quor be come forth, and when it is in manner done, take it from the fire, and put it into an earthen vessell well glazed, and put therein that which ye distilled, and mix them well together, then strain it hard through a Canvas, and passe it by a filter, or a linnen cloth, and make it as clear as you can possible, then take that, and with refined Sugar, make a Sirrup according to Art, and when it is made, aromatise it with Musk, and Rose|water, and keep it in a glasse close stopped, that it take no air, giving your charge that it be not over-boyled. And this thou shalt give unto those that cannot digest their meat, because it warmeth the stomack, with a temperate heat, the which resolveth the cruditie of humours, that are in the stomack, and disposeth Nature to digestion, for because the Quinces by nature are hot, and helpeth it to digest, the Cloves and Saffron make the heart merrie, and the Lignum Aloes, pre|serveth from Corruption, in such sort, that all these being to|gether, worketh wonderfull effects in the bodie of many, the quantitie thereof is {ounce}. i. in the morning, and two hours after supper cold. 126 CHAP.

And as for the cure of the Pox, this is a most soveraign remedie, when there are tumours, or pains, or inflations. But when there are Ul|cers, Scabbs, or Inflammations, in that case you may not use it by any means, because it is very hot, and will cause greater inflammation. And therefore if any will use this Sirrup to cure pains, swellings, or inflammations, it were necessarie first to take our Aromatico, written in this Book, with divers other Medicines of our Invention, that being done, let him take seven or eight times our Sirrupo solutivo,, and then begin to take this Sirrup, and sweat thereon morning and evening: His meat shall be rost Mutton, or a Bird, Raisins, Dates, Almonds, and such like, but he must not eat too much.

XLIV. A Sirrup of Juniper Berries. THis Sirrup of Juniper Berries is of great vertue, because it is one of those fruits that continueth green all the year: of the which hearbs I have written a discourse in my book called La Physica del Phioravante, and the order to make it is thus. Take Juniper Berries when they begin to wax black four pound, and stamp them, and infuse them in twelve pound of strong white Wine six dayes, then distill it with two pound of white Hony, and {ounce}. i. of Cinnamon, untill yee have re|ceived two pound, then take it from the fire, and strain out the Fesses that remained with a presse, then strain it by a filter again, then with Sugar make a Sirrup in good form, and when it is boiled, put therein the said water distilled from the berries, and so without fire incorporate them well together, and keep it in a glasse close shut that it take no air: the dose is an ounce and a half to be taken warm. This is excellent for those that are troubled with wind, or coldnesse of the stomack, because it warmeth, drieth, and helpeth digestion, and therefore this would work miraculous effects in Almaign, because it is a cold Region, and that they eat many moist meats, the which Nature cannot well digest: It is also appro|priate against pains of the Mother, because it provoketh men|strua, and purgeth the Matrix, and helpeth digestion, and causeth sleep, with divers other vertues.

CHAP. XLVI. To make a Sirrup of Sarsa parilla, of our invention. THe Sarsa parilla is a Root that cometh from the Indies, the which is hot and drying, of the which Physitians make Sirrups and Potions for divers infirmities, wherein it is need|full of drying by sweat: but untill this time they have all abu|sed themselves in the order, because all hot and dry things are spirituall, and so in making their decoction the spirits goe away in fume, and the decoction remaineth senza anima, and vertue, in respect: yee shall understand, that the Sarsa parilla is a root miraculous in his operation, because it warmeth the cold, and drieth the humidity, and resolveth tumours, and healeth sores, and helpeth paines, when it is made according to our order, and because it is a Medicine in so common use, I will shew thee the order to make this Sirrup, that shall have 129 both anima, and vertue, in so much that the world shall won|der at it: and the order to make it is thus.

THis China is a root like unto the root of Canna, the which is brought unto us out of India, from an Isle called China, from whence it took his name China, and there are of two sorts: the one is white and heavy, the other is great, and red, and light, and of this I have made no experience at all: But of the other I have had great experience, and by the help of God have resolved great and terrible diseases, and the order to condite them after our order is this. Take {ounce}. vi. of China, and {ounce}. iii. of Lignum Aloes of the best that yee can finde, and {ounce}. iiii. of Pollipodie, and {ounce}. i. of Coloquintida, beat all these grossely, and put them into a di|stilling glasse, with twenty pound of good Wine, then give 130 it fire untill ye have received three pound of water, then let it cool, and strain it, then put therein the water that yee distil|led first, and incorporate them well together, and of this give {ounce}. iiii. at a time warm, then cast away the Fesses, for they are unprofitable. But the Sirrup is of such vertue, that it resol|veth tumours, sores, pains, and all other indispositions caused of the Pox. It serveth also for Doglie Artetich, for pains of the Gout, and for many other indispositions caused of cru|ditie, and coldnesse of the humours, because it is of na|ture hot and drying, and his vertues are to drie: I have seen of this Sirrup great experience in divers and sundry causes. CHAP. XLVIII. A Potion of Alchachengie, and wherefore it serveth. THis Herb Alchachengie with his fruit is aperative, and most profitable for those that cannot make water, by reason of alteration of the pores that are altered through cold, for this is hot and drying, by the which means, it resolveth the alteration of the aforesaid cause, and causeth the Urine to passe with ease; It helpeth the digestion, and comforteth the stomack, when it is grieved through winde or cold: And the order to make it is thus. Take that Herb, with Root, Leaves, fruit and all, and lay it to infuse in the water of Mallows, with the Herb Pelitorie, and there let them remain five or six dayes, then put there|unto course Sugar, and let it boil one hour and no more, and then strain it, and put thereunto a little Cinnamon, and then it is finished: and when you will occupie it against difficulty of Urine, give them thereof {ounce}. iiii. and keep them warm in bed, and they shall feel great ease.

THe Herb Iva Artetica, as I have shewed in another place, is of marvellous vertue, also the Camedrios is of great ver|tue, and is hot and dry by nature. The Iva is good against the accident of the Fever, and the Camedrios dissolveth the melancholie humour; and therefore when a decoction is made of these two Herbs, it will work a marvellous effect in the cure of the said Fever, because it provoketh sweat, and assubtiliateth the grossenesse of the humour, and extin|guisheth the accident of the Fever in such sort, that the Fever shall resolve with good successe, and the order to make that Potion is thus.

THis is a Magistrall Potion, the which helpeth against all Infirmities, by reason that it destroyeth all the evill qua|lities in our bodies, it comforteth Nature, helpeth digestion, provoketh Urine, and looseth the bodie, the which things are most comfortable to our bodies, and the order to make it is thus.

CHAP. LII. An Infusion with Wine most precious against the Gout. THe Gout is a putrified and rotten disease, as I have written of in divers places, and the cure thereof is hard, because it were needfull to help many inconveniences before yee come to the cure. Neverthelesse, it is a strange thing to see divers, that after they are cured they have no care to preserve them: so that look which way they got it, that way it will come again, but if they would use defensives and preservatives, they may remain well, and therefore I have devised this Wine, the which they shall continually drink: for as long as they use this Wine, the Gout shall never trouble them, and the order to make it is thus. 134 Take Vino negro that is sweet and pleasant, about twelve gallons, and put it in a vessell that is well seasoned, and in that Wine put fine Lignum Aloes in powder {ounce}. iii. Pollipodie of the Oak {ounce}. iiii. Sena of Levant {ounce}. ii.

CHAP. LIII. Another artificiall Wine, against the stitch in the side, and gra|vell. THe stitch in the side, and the gravell in the Reins, are some|what of kin together, because they are caused of one cause, that is, of vapours corrupt and rotten, and of grossenesse, and evill qualities of the humours, the which, one with the other, ingender that infirmity, which in some men is no other then an evill indisposition inwardly, the which is very hard to be helped, for if thou wilt resolve it, it were necessary, first to remove the evill quality, and then cure it, and after they are cured to preserve them, that the said indisposition return not again, and in so doing thy cure shall have good successe, and therefore I have made this Wine to preserve thee from that indisposition, and the order to make it is thus. Take as it were a Hogshead or a Barrell of good white Wine, that containeth about eighteen gallons of Wine, in the which yee shall put Carduus Benedictus {ounce}. ii. Saxifrage {ounce}. vi. Walwort {ounce}. iiii. Pollipodie {ounce}. iiii. Cinnamon {ounce}. i.

For whosoever doth use this wine, shall never be troubled with those kinds of infirmities, because it doth losen the belly, mundifie, cleanse, and preserve from all evill quali|ties.

Take Pears of what sort yee will, and cut them in four peices, then boil them in water till they be soft, and that the water be almost consumed, then passe it through a strainer, and put thereunto as much white Hony purified as it weigheth, and thereof make an Electuary in good form, and when it is made, aromatise it with Musk, then for every pound of the said Electu|ary, put thereunto {ounce}. i. of perfect oil of Tartar, made by disso|lution after it is calcined white: But yee shall note, that the Oil must be put in when the Electuary is cold, and so mix it toge|ther, then keep it in a glazen vessell: The dose is from {ounce}. ss. to an ounce in the morning fasting, and eat no meat in four hours after: for this, as I have said, will cure the indisposition of the Stomack, pains of the Milt, pains of the Body that have continued long, pains of the Mother, and such like things that are caused of cold and moist humours. 137 CHAP.

THere are many causes that hinder digestion, as through coldnesse of the Stomack, through heat, through moist|nesse or drynesse, or through superfluous choller, or flegm, or melancholy, of the which things the Physitian cannot certifie himself which it is, so by that meanes many proved divers Remedies for that indisposition, and cannot find the way to help it. And therefore I will shew thee a plaister that hath all these four principall intentions; that is, to help digestion, strengthen the stomack, make the heart merrie, which things 139 are all necessarie to preserve a man within good temperature and health, and the Remedie is this. Take these Hearbs gathered in their times and dried, that is, Sage, Rosemary, Wormwood, Balm, Saint Johns-wort, Net|tles, of each as much you will, beat them finely, and searce them: then take for every pound of that powder of Cinna|mon, {ounce}. i. half an ounce of Cloves, and as much Lignum Aloes, and ten grains of Musk dissolved in Rosewater; then take for every pound, of good Honie {ounce}. ii. and as much Vinegar, and make them into the form of a liquid Plaister, and when thou wilt occupie it, spread it upon a cloth warm, and lay it to the stomack, and in the mean while eat restorative meats, and drink small wine.

LIX. To make a Liquor to comfort the Smelling, and to preserve the Head. THe Smelling is one of the five Senses of our Bodie, of the which four-footed beasts have great use; for they will not 138 receive any thing into the bodie before they have smelled unto it, and then if it be against their nature, they will not eat it, and therefore this smelling is that which preserveth the hearing, the seeing and the taste; for if the nose take an evill smell, all the other senses have part: For if yee smell to Onions or Scallions, the taste will be troubled, the eyes will weep, the eares will also be troubled: And to the contrary, when a man smelleth a good smell, it comforteth the eyes, the hearing, and taste, and for that cause I have made this liquor, to comfort the Smelling, for by that the whole bodie is comforted, and the order to make it is thus. Take Lignum Aloes {ounce}. ii. Annise seed, {ounce}. iiii. Calamus Aro|maticus {ounce}. i. Calaminte dried, three ounces, common Honey two pound, strong white wine twelve pound, let all these be infused for four dayes, and then distill it in Balneo, and when yee distill it, put into the Receiver six grains of Musk dissolved in two ounces of Rosewater, and distill away but three pound, the which keep in a glasse close stopped, and when yee will comfort the smelling, wash the face and beard therewith, and thou shalt smell a savour of marvellous effect, the which comforteth Nature marvellously: It comforteth the Stomack, and helpeth a stinking breath: It helpeth the mouth being ulcerated, and those that have the Rupture in short time, if yee wash it twice a day therewith. It helpeth also women that are troubled with dissention of the Matrix, if ye wet a cloth therein and lay it upon the Mother, in short space it shall receive great health. Also it helpeth those that are troubled with the Meagrum, or pains in the Head coming of cold or winde, if ye wash the Head with the said Liquor, presently they shall feel ease, with divers other vertues, the which I will leave untill another time.

THis Decoction is a composition of our Invention, and may be made in the same order as ye doe with Lignum vitae, 140 or Sarsaparilla, and hath no lesse vertue against contagious diseases, and hath so great vertue in drying and resolving, that it is to be wondred at, and may be used in all causes in stead of Sarsaparilla, or Lignum vitae, or China, and this I have found out by great travell and experience, and the order to make it is thus. Take the Roots of the Vine, or the stalks, and cut them small, then take thereof two pound, and infuse them in strong Vi|negar untill they be covered, then put thereunto xii. pound of common water, and one pound of white Honey, and boil them untill the consumption of the third part, so that there remain eight pound, then strain it, and put thereunto [...] ss. of Julep sim|ple, then keep it in a glasse close shut to thy use, for it ser|veth against many diseases or infirmities, and for those that have lost their appetite, if they take thereof four ounces morning and evening warm, and fast thereon four or five houres, in short time they shall recover it again.

If ye use to eat of this oyle, it mittigateth and healeth all the in|dispositions of the bodie, for it is of so much sustenance and vertue, that it preserveth the bodie in temperature: And these have I found out by experience. CHAP. LXI. To make a composition of the Hearb Mercurie. THis Hearb Mercurie is of so much vertue that the tongue cannot expresse it, and many Philosophers have assigned 141 unto it Celestiall vertue, because it preserveth a man in a youthfull state a long time, and from infirmities: It ma|keth the heart merrie, the which it doth by his secret and hidden vertues, and the order to make the said compositi|on is thus.

Among the rest I saw once a Gentleman that had the Palsie one and twentie moneths, the which by using of this composition the space of ten moneths was perfectly whole. Another Composition also I have made, the which is of marvellous vertue, and is in this order. Take the Hearb Mercurie when it is floured, and accom|pany it with Wine and Honey, then distill it, and sepa|rate the Elements according to Art, and thou shalt have a most rare Medicine, wherewith thou mayest help many infirmities. But first I would counsell you, ere you use this, to prepare the bodie with taking once our Aromatico, the which cleanseth both the stomack and body, and thus doing thou shalt reap fame. CHAP. LXII.

THere are four kinds of these, according to the writing of Dioscorides, but that which the Author doth write of in this 142 place, is that which Dioscorides calleth Xanthium, and in the Shops it is"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"called Lappa Minor, and Lappa Inversa, and in the Italian Lappaciole Minore, and in English it is called the Ditch-Bur, and Louse-Bur. Take that hearb with the root and all, what quantity yee will, and distill thereof a water, the which keep unto thy use, and when yee will use it against the Catarre, take of that water four ounces, with white crude Hony half an ounce, mix them well together, and drink it in the morning warm as soon as yee rise, and fast thereon four or five hours, and use a reasonable diet in your meat and drink, and eat nothing that may offend the Catarre, and so using this reme|dy for a moneth together, thou shalt help any sort of Catarre perfectly, by vertue of that hearb. For this I have experimen|ted divers and sundry times in poor and simple Catarres. But [...] if they come of the Pox, or Hectick, in that case it may pleasure them much, but yet not cure them. Yee shall note, that it would be necessary for the Patient to take a dose of our Aromatico before he take the said Medicine, because our Aromatico disposeth the Catarre to solution, whereby it may be the sooner cured. CHAP. LIII. Of Pollipodie, and his vertues. THis hearb is well known to most men, and hath great ver|tue against old greifs, and opilations, and all indisposi|tions that come through distemperment of humours, because it evacuateth the body, cleanseth the head, and purgeth the bloud: and the order to make it is thus. Take Pollipodie two ounces, Sene one ounce, Lignum Aloes half an ounce, mix these well together in a stone morter, then take white Wine as much as yee will, and for every pound of Wine put thereto {ounce}. i. of that mixture, and so let it stand four and twenty hours, and then drink it, for it will purge without any pain, those that have any indisposition of the stomack, weaknesse of the legs, and faintnesse of the body, and such like. For yee shall understand, the Pollipodie pur|geth 143 Flegm, and the Sene purgeth Choller, as by the viscosity is known: The Lignum Aloes preserveth nature, so that by the ingredients yee may know the vertue of this compositi|on. Yee shall understand, that this root would be gathered when the Sunne is afarre off; and that the cold time of the year doth begin to draw on, for then they are of most force. CHAP. LXIV. Of the Olive, and his vertues. TAke common Oil, the which is made of the Olive, two pound, Frankincense one pound, Turpentine one pound, distill them together in a Retort two dayes long, then sepa|rate the oyle from the water, and keep each alone, then take forth the Fesses out of the Retort, the which is a miracle of Nature, because it serveth against all Infirmities, where it is applyed. It helpeth broaken bones wonderfully, and these secrets I have found out by experience. There is also drawn out of the wood a liquour by discention, the which is black of colour, and is of marvellous vertue against paines. A little of this Oil being mixed with Oil of Sulphur, helpeth all putrified and corrosive Ulcers that are caused of putrifaction of hu|mours. The Lye made of the Ashes of"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"Olives, preserveth the beard and hair in their naturall colour, if yee wash the head often therewith. Of this Oil I have made a great discourse in my Chirurgery. CHAP. LXV. Of Ciperous, and his vertues. THis hearb being put into new Wine, when it worketh in the Hogshead, giveth it a pleasant savour, and whosoever useth to drink of that Wine, it will defend him from all interiour passions that are caused of ventosity, and helpeth those that are troubled with the Rupture, because it resolveth the wind, 144 and hath a restrictive vertue. It purgeth the bloud mar|vellously, and causeth digestion, and of this I have seen the experience. Also I saw one, that in the moneths of April, May, and June, took the roots of Ciperous and beat them to powder, and made thereof a plaister, and laid it upon the Rupture, changing it every day once: and also he eat of the said roots, and so in short time he was helped; and that experiment I have seen divers times. Also if yee take those nodes or knots that are on the roots, and stamp them, and boil them with common Oil, Frankincense, and yellow Wax, untill it become black of colour, it will cure wounds mar|vellously, it mittigateth the pains in all old sores, it cureth all pains coming of humidity and wind: Moreover, if yee annoint the body with the said Oil, and drink the Wine wherein hath lien infused the said root, it will preserve it mar|vellously. And among all other things that I saw of this Ciperous; there was a Merchant called Nicolo Carbolo, the which was of the age of thirty yeares, and was troubled with a kind of scab like a Leper, and had carried it long, the which I caused to make this Oil, and he did not onely annoint him therewith, but also drunk thereof every morning {ounce}. ss. with wine, so that in short time he became so whole and sound, that it was to be wondered at. CHAP. LXVI. Of Rew, and his vertues. TAke Rew when it is seeded, but yet not dry, and stamp it in a Morter, and for every pound of Rew, put thereto {ounce}. vi. of Turpentine, and as much of the yolks of Eggs hard sod, and incorporate them well together; then put it in a glasse close stopped, and set it to putrifie in warm dung five and twenty dayes, then distill it by a Retort according unto art, untill all the substance be come forth, the which will be both Oil and water, the which yee shall separate. The wa|ter serveth against all pains of the belly that are caused of cold and moistnesse; the dose is {dram}. ss. in some warm broth, 145 and may be taken at any time. Also giving it to any that hath a [...]ever coming with cold, it will help him in short time: yea, some have been cured at once or twice taking the same. Moreover, the Oil is most soveraign against cold greifs, as well inward as outward, it preserveth those greatly, that take every morning a drachm with sweet wine, and fast thereon four or five hours. Also for outward griefs it is most ex|cellent, if yee annoint them therewith cold, because it resol|veth and drieth all evill qualities of our bodies: besides these experiences, I have made an Oil of the seed of Rew by ex|pression, the which is of so much"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"vertue, that if yee annoint the head therewith, it causeth a good memory unto those that have lost it, or are weak by reason of humidity, or cold. CHAP. LXVII. Of Wormwood, and his vertues. THis hearb Wormwood is of great vertue, if yee can use it well: for if any lean persons or evill coloured use the same, it will bring them to their perfect health and colour, and the order to make it is thus. Take Wormwood and distill it in Balneo, then put there|unto Oil of Vitriol, as much as will suffice to make it tart, and thereof use every morning one spoonfull fasting, and in short time it will restore thee to perfecter health than ever thou wast before, and bring thy colour again. CHAP. LXVIII. Of Gratia Dei, and his vertues and operation in divers infir|mities. THis Gratia Dei is an hearb well known unto most men, and is like unto Germander, and bitter in taste, and it ought to be gathered in July and August, and must be dried in the shadow, hanging so that it may touch nothing, and 146 then {scruple} i. of this powder will provoke vomit, and ease Na|ture. It helpeth also putrified Ulcers, if ye make a decoction thereof with Lye, and then wet clothes therein, and lay them upon the sore; for as it causeth to vomit and evacuateth the stomack, so neither more nor lesse it causeth the Ulcer to vo|mit, or purge, and healeth it with great speed: It helpeth much those that are Phrenzie, by reason that it mundifieth the sto|mack and bodie from such putrifaction. A most excellent composition of this Hearb. Take thereof in fine powder, {ounce}.i. Cinnamon, {dram}.i. Cloves, {scruple}. i. Wheat flower one pound, Zucche compost condit. {ounce}. iii. Oranges condited, one ounce, beat them altogether, and make thereof a past with Honey, and form it like a loaf, and set it in an Oven to bake, but take heed it doe not burn, and when thou wilt use it, give thereof one ounce, and it will purge gallantly, and is very delectable to be eaten. This Purgation is divine in many in|firmities, but above all other against Scrophule, the white Scall, and Scabs, because it evacuateth onely the superfluous humi|ditie, and drieth, and is appropriate for these infirmities: For ye shall note, that all Soluble Medicines doe not serve in one infirmitie, because one is Cholerick, the other Sanguine, one Flegmatick, and the other Melancholie, and for that cause it is necessary to find the proper Medicine for the infirmitie. The Rhabarb purgeth Choller: The Eleborus Melancholie; the Ebulus or Wallwort Flegm, and the Gratia dei the bloody, so that every one hath his propertie. "},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"CHAP. LXIX. Of Wallwort and his Vertues and Operations. VVAllwort is an Herb· well known, and groweth in a fat ground, and hath leaves, flouers, and seed like Elder, and is of such vertue that it is to be wondred at, for if it were brought unto us from farr Countries, it would be accounted above all other hearbs, but being so familiar among us, we make no account thereof. This Herb called Wallwort or Dainwort, by his propertie and nature provoketh vomit 147 and dissolveth the bodie, if ye drinke the juyce thereof, or eat the Hearb green: The water distilled of this Root being drunke, and applied outwardly with wet clothes unto the Gout, it taketh away the pain. If ye give the juyce of this Hearb with Sirrup of Acetose to drink, it will help frantick Fevers. The pouder of his leaves hath great operation in all sorts of putrified Ulcers, because it taketh away the pain, mun|difieth, and incarnateth, with divers other vertues, the which if I should write them they would not be credited, and there|fore I leave it to the Experimentor. CHAP. LXX. Of Millefolie or Yarrow, and his great vertue. THis Hearb Millefolie, is well known unto most men; and of many is little esteemed, because it groweth so common|ly amongst us. This Hearb being green, is a miraculous and divine remedie, to help any sorts of fresh and bleeding wounds, if ye stamp a handfull thereof, and lay it thereupon the lips being close joyned together, within the space of four and twentie-houres it shall be perfectly whole. If yee drinke three ounces of the juyce of this Hearb with new Milk, morn|ing and evening, it will help Gonorrea in short time. It is al|so an excellent remedie for those that have their Liver and Lungs ulcerated, for this I have proved divers and sundry times in Goats, the which are troubled with a certain infir|mitie, the which is called Bissole of the Goat-keepers, for they are certain Imposthumes that doe ingender in the Liver and the Lungs, and causeth them to die. I then seeing that in the interiour parts of the Goats, made this experience, I took Millefolie made in powder, and gave it unto the Goats with Salt, and for the most part they were helped; and af|ter that I cured a number of men and women of that disease, for of that infirmity there die a great number in the world. And with the said order aforesaid, thou mayest save a number, but it must be mixed with Sal artificiato Leonardo. Those that are Ettici and Tesici die commonly through Imposthumes 149 and Ulcers that are caused in the Liver, for of this I have seen above an hundred. For after they were dead, I have caused them to be opened to see the experience. You shall understand, that this Hearb Millefolie hath a great propertie to heal those Ul|cers. And therefore the Chirurgian that understandeth not Physick, can ill help those Ulcers inwardly, because he can|not apply his Unguents and Plaisters, as he doth outwardly. And those kind of Ulcers cannot be known, but of those which have seen them, and have seen the successe of their diseases, and therefore I may well discourse thereof, because of them have passed a great number through my hands, and I have seen them with mine eyes. So that I conclude, that all which I have said is two things, the one is, to see the thing in fact, the other, to have approved Medicines to help them. A most excellent composition of this Hearb, the which helpeth wounds in very short time."},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"Take this Hearb when it is floured, and readie to seed, and put thereunto Bdellium, Frankincense, and common oyle, and make thereof as it were Mustard, then distill it with a gen|tle fire, with great diligence, as ye distill our Oleum Benedi|ctum, and thou shalt have a rare Secret against all manner of wounds, so that it causeth the world to wonder at his ope|ration. CHAP. LXXI. Of Gentian and his Experiments, approved by mee many times. THis Hearb is well known, and his vertue is most in the Root, and is a miraculous and divine remedie for those that have pains within the bodie caused of winde, and also for those that have the Stitch in the side, if yee give the pow|der thereof in sweet white wine, for presently it taketh away the pain, because his nature is to dissolve winde, the which is cau|sed of oppilations of the Pores through abundance of humi|ditie, and the Gentian hath vertue to drie and dissolve wind, 148 and so Nature doth evaporate the ventositie: And this is the reason why the Gentian doth that effect. CHAP. LXXII. Of Imperatoria and his great experience that it doth against pains of the Mother. THis Hearb is of great vertue in his operation, if his Root be made in powder, and given to eat with Honey unto a woman that is troubled with the Mother, either through cold or heat. For if they be grieved through cold, the Im|peratoria which is hot, doth dissolve it, and they shall be deli|vered. If it be through heat, the heat is alwaies windie, be|cause the heat is none other thing, then a humour retained in those parts, the which this hearb by his proper vertue and qualitie doth resolve. So that whether it be cold or hot, this vertuous hearb helpeth them with great speed, for this I have proved an infinite number of times. Moreover this hearb hath great vertue to comfort the stomack, and causeth digestion, and to preserve all the bodie, and for that cause the Ancients have called it Imperatoria. CHAP. LXXIII. Of Cardo Sancto and his vertues particular, the which I have proved. THere are many kind of hearbs, the which are called Cardi, but unto that which they call Cardo Sancto; they have ad|ded Sancto, because the people should know, that it is an hearb of great value in certain diseases, so that it is to bee wondred at for his operation. And that which I have seen, thereof will I write in this place, that is, if yee stamp this hearb when it is green, and lay it upon the wound, it will heal it miraculously, and with great speed. Also the juyce or powder of the said hearb being given to drink unto those that have worms, presently it helpeth them. This Herb being dried 150 and infused in Aqua vitae, and given to drink to any that is grieved with"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"any grievous pains, in short time he shall bee whole. This Hearb is also good for the sight of the eies: If ye make a past thereof with Bread and Honey, and distill it with white wine, it is most excellent. It hath also two great Vertues to preserve humane bodies, the which I have proved, the one is outwardly, and the other inwardly, and they are made in this order. Take Carduus Benedictus when it beginneth to flour, and stamp it grosly, and infuse it in common oyle and Aqua vi|tae, with a little Frankincense, and there let them remain, un|till they be macerated, then boil them and strain it, then take thereof a third part, and put thereto a little Virgin waxe, and let it boil, untill it begin to fume, and turn to a black co|lour, then strain it, and keep it in a glasse close shut, that it take no aire, then if yee take one drachm of the oyle with sweet wine cold, it will resolve any infirmitie, and preserve them that use it in health; with the black liquor yee shall an|noint all the body when yee go to bed, cold, the which doth not onely resolve the evill qualitie, but preserveth a man in good state. It maintaineth the hair black, so that it shall not waxe white: It killeth worms in the bodie, with divers other things, that I will leave untill another time. CHAP. LXXIV. Of sweet Marjoram, and of his Secrets the which I have proved. MArjoram hath great and rare vertues, the which I have proved, because others might know them and use them, when occasion shall serve. And first I will write of the juyce, the which is of such strength and vertue, that one ounce thereof being mixt with one drachm of Oyl of bitter Almonds, and one scruple of Mastick in powder, being snuffed up at the nose, untill it come unto the mouth, it purgeth the head of all pains, dissolveth tumours, quickneth the sight, and cau|seth sleep, and helpeth the head of all infirmities: Also Mar|joram 151 put into Vinegar, with Cloves and Cinnamon, and make thereof an Epithema, it dissolveth the evill disposition of the stomack, and quickeneth the appetite, and provoketh sleep, and being eaten in Sallets, it comforteth the Stomack marvellously, with divers other vertues, the which I have not seen.

THis Hearb is of marvellous vertue, for if it be laid upon a wound, either green or drie, it healeth it marvellously, and with speed, and that it doth by his hidden and secret vertue. The decoction of this Hearb healeth wounds in|wardly, and also other offences, it helpeth the Rupture in young children, being new done, if yee lay it thereon, and bind it hard with a Trusse, these Vertues I have seen of this Hearb.

And this it doth by his proper qualitie, and hidden vertue. 152 CHAP. LXXVII. Of Nettles, and his vertue in many operations. THis hearb is commonly known among us, and is of mar|vellous vertue, and his effects are uncredible. Neverthe|lesse, I will not let to shew one experiment of it, the which is marvellous, and is this: Take a Capon, and pull away all his feathers from his breast, and beat him with Nettles, and he will call in the young Chickens, and govern them like the Hen. Nettles being dried and made into powder, and given to eat unto a man, it will provoke venereous acts, being used to be eaten in meats, it purgeth the Matrix, it helpeth scabs, if you wash them with his decoction, and mittigateth all pains coming of cold, making a bath thereof; his decoction helpeth the tooth-ach, with many other vertues that I have not proved. But truly I beleeve, that if any would give him|self to seek experience in this hearb, he should see strange things. For I have alwayes seen that in these kind of hearbs, that naturally will not be touched, God and Nature hath gi|ven great vertue. CHAP. LXXVIII. Of Hysop of the Mountain.

CHAP. LXXX. Of the effects of Wine, and what cometh thereof. FIrst I will speak of Wine and his qualities. You shall un|derstand, that Wine is a liquour the which changeth into divers kinds differing from his own nature: And first it changeth into Vineger of it self without any artifice, the which can never be turned into Wine again. Also they se|parate from Wine Aqua vitae, the which being separated can|not be turned into Wine again. Also Wine maketh, by setling it self, a certain stone called Tartar, the which can ne|ver be turned into Wine again, nor yet into Vineger. And thus when the workman doth transmute or change it, it can|not be turned again into his first quality. Wine is very apt to corrupt, and to change into other kinds, but after that it changeth or transmuteth, it is uncorruptible: for when it is turned into Vineger, it is apt to conserve all things. Vege|table and Animall that is put therein, but not the Minerals, for by nature it is enemy unto them. There is also sepa|rated from Wine Aqua vitae, the which is conservatrix of all Medicines; for when it is circulated and made into a Quint|essence it becometh celestiall, as I have shewed in my other books, and therewith thou mayest help many infirmities, because it mittigateth all pains, and dissolveth in a manner all infirmities, and especially when it is compounded in this manner. Take of that Quintessence four parts, Oil of Sulphur and Vitrioll of each one part, Julep of Violets sixty parts: Mix them all together, and it will be of such vertue, that if yee give {dram}. i."},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"thereof to drink to one that lay at the point of death, it would recover him, because it breaketh choller, preserveth the stomack, causeth an appetite, and helpeth any sort of Fe|ver, and preserveth both men and women in lusty state, if they 155 use it oftentimes; for these experiences I have seen divers times. Also of the Tartar yee may may make Oyle, the which is of marvellous vertue, both in Physick, Chirurgerie, and Alchimie. There is also drawn forth of Tartar, his spirit and oyle in this order, as Andernacus writeth, the which is most profitable against sundry infirmities, and the order to make it is thus. Take white Tartar and beat it to powder four pound, and put it into a stone pot or glasse well luted, and set it in a fur|nace to distill with a great Receiver close luted, least all the fumes come forth or break the glasse, then give it first a small fire, and so increase it as though thou wouldest draw a strong water, and so continue it untill there come forth no more spirits, then let it wax cold, and take forth the liquor, and put it into an upright glasse with his head and receiver, and di|still away the water in Balneo, then take that oyle which is in the bottome, and distill it in Sand or Ashes, and there will come forth at the first a yellowish oyle, and so by little and little it will change colour, and become blacker and blacker, and thick like unto a Balme, or a Sirrup. You shall understand, that the first Liquor separated in Balneo, is cal|led Liquor fecularum vini, or Spiritus Tartari, the oyle which yee rectified in Sand, is called Oleum fecularum vini, sive Mumia fecularum vini the which is most effectuall and profitable in curing all running Ulcers that goeth creeping upon the flesh, and especially those that come Ex lue venerea, for this Mumia doth so cure those malign Ulcers, that their malice can hurt no more, but shall be quite extincted: Be|ing drunke with wine, it doth break and expell the Stone in the Reins and Bladder, it provoketh Urine and purgeth Ulcers. Furthermore, {dram}. i. of the liquor or spirit of Tartar, being drunke with water of Fumitorie or Hirundinariae or such like, as is most convenient for Pustulas gallicas ex anthemate erici|pelas, the Dropsie, Water betwixt the skin and the flesh, Fevers, Menstrua, and all obstructions of those parts; it will work all those effects more effectuall if it be taken with water of Tria|cle, the which is made as hereafter followeth. Also yee shall understand that this spirit of Tartar must be rectified four or 156 five times from the calces of his Fesses in Balneo, to take away his stinking smell, and then it will be the purer and more effectuall, and this is the making of Aqua Theriacalis. Take Triacle of Alexander that is perfect good· {ounce}. v. red Myrrh, {ounce}. ii. Saffron, {ounce}. ss. mix them together in a glasse, and pour thereon, {ounce}. x. of the spirit of Wine, and then set them close stopped to digest, then distill it according unto art; sometime they put into this water {scruple}. ii. of Camphire especi|ally when it is used in hot burning Fevers and Infla~mations, and and then it is called Aqua theriacalis camforata, this Compositi|on following being drunk, hath a singular piercing vertue. Take Spiritus calcanthi, {ounce}. i. Liquoris fecularum vini correcti, {ounce}. iii. Aqua Theriacalis {ounce}. v. give thereof {dram}. i. in strong wine or o|ther convenient liquor both for the aforesaid defects, and al|so to prevent and cure infinite other diseases. CHAP. LXXXI.

Neverthelesse, it hath not the vertue and qualitie of that which is made of wine, because his nature is to preserve those things which are put therein, as is said before. If yee doe distill Vinegar in Balneo untill it remain drie, and then burn those Fesses un|till they come white, and then lay them in a moist place, it will turn into Oyle, the which is of such vertue for mans bo|die, that it is not to be credited, for if yee give thereof a small quantitie to drink, it will dissolve the Gravel, and Stone in the Bladder. And therefore this is a worthy secret to be known, the which was never revealed before to any man: As for his o|ther vertues, they are known to all men. Distilled Vinegar be|ing mixed with a little oyle of Tartar and Aqua vitae, preserveth the face, and maketh it fair, but if it were not a sin to offend God, I could say such great and strange things of distilled 157 Vinegar, that it would cause the world to wonder at it, but for troubling my conscience, I will hold my peace for this time, and leave this to be sufficient, which I have written al|ready.

Take the Fesses of Aqua fortis, made with Roch Allom, Sal Niter, and Vitriol two pound, Allum du Fesse two pound, mix them well together, and put them into a Furnace to cal|cine, untill it become to a hard stone: and when it is calcined, make it presently into powder, and set it four or five nights in the ayre, and it will turn moist, then take six pound of pure Aqua vitae without flegm, and put therein the same pow|der, and so let it remain eight daies, every day stirring it once, then pour of that part which is clear, and keep it as a preci|ous Jewell, then take the Fesses and calcine them again, as yee did at the first, and make them in powder again: And this powder mundifieth all filthie and stinking sores, and with this water thou mayest help them, if that the workman can apply it with reason. Also with this water may be done great cures in Physick, if it be given as it ought to be. Also of the said powder there may be made Pills and Potions, that worketh miracles in the world, as I have seen divers times. CHAP. LXXXIII. Of Verjuyce made of Grapes, and his Secrets.

And all these are with great reason, for yee shall understand that the Verjuyce without a|ny other Artifice, doth mundifie the stomack, and loose the bodie, and purifie the blood: The Honey is Cordiall, and is hot by nature, and dissolveth winde, the Alum du Fesse drieth, and destroyeth all the evill humours: The Talk is bright and shining, and his whitenesse doth penetrate very much: The Betonie comforteth the stomack, and is windie: The Milk is aperative and nutritive, and therefore consider well thereon, and thou shalt find it reason and experience that I have said. CHAP. LXXXIV. Certain Secrets of Animals, and first of the Oxe. THe fat of the Oxe is very appropriate to Unguents, to help all manner of sores, because it comforteth the place offen|ded, and mittigateth the pain; but when this grease or fat shall be distilled with Turpentine and Wax, it will work Mi|racles in divers operations, of the which I will not speak in this place. There is in the throat of divers old Oxen certain knots or kernels as a man may term them, the which are of the bigness of an Olive, some are bigger and some lesser, according to the age of the Oxe. Take of those kernells, and hang them up to drie in the shadow, and make thereof powder, and of that powder give every morning, ss. {ounce}. 159 unto those that have the Dropsie, and in short time they shall be helped. Also the sinnews of an Oxe being dried, and made lint to make tents or stoppings, is most excellent, and will work great effects, and this is one of the Secrets, the which I never meant to reveal untill death. The blood of a young Bull that is not gelded, being drunken as it is warm, is most strong poison, there are also divers other things, the which I would write of this Beast but for tediousnesse sake. CHAP. LXXXV. Of the Goat. THe fat of the Male Goat before he is gelded is of much vertue, because it comforteth all members that are offended, as well inwardly as outwardly: If yee annoint any that hath the Flux with the said grease, it will doe him great pleasure. Also the dung of the Goat is most excellent to mollifie sinnews that are indurated in any place, and therefore this dung being put into Unguents appropriate, of force must work great Effects. CHAP. LXXXVI. Of the Horse and his Vertues. THe Dung of the Horse is of great vertue, for if a man were lame, and indurated through grosse and viscous humours, let him be buried in fresh warm Horse dung two hours, and in ten or"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"twelve daies he shall be helped. The fat of the Horse is very hot and penetrative, and especially that in the neck, where the Main groweth. Also the fat being distil|led with the rosin of the Pine tree and Myrrh, is miraculous against shrunk sinnews. 160 CHAP. LXXXVII. Of the Dog and his Secrets. THe Dog is an amiable Animall above all other unto man, for he understandeth in a manner what a man doth say; and from the Dog is taken many wholsome things for man, for of the skin they make Gloves, and such like, the which are wholsome for them that wear them. The fat of the Dog is very hot and piercing, and dissolveth all pains that come of cold. The dung of a Dog is profitable to dresse Leather with|all, also his blood mixed with Hogs grease, and the Ashes of a Vine, dissolveth all manner of swellings, that come in divers parts of the bodie. CHAP. LXXXVIII. Of the Cat and his Vertues. THe Cat is very hot, above all other animals, that apper|tain unto the house, and his fat is of such heat, that it is uncredible to be spoken of, and he is never in love, or goeth a catterwalling, but in the coldest weather. The Brain of the Cat is of such a heat, that if any doe eat thereof, it will make him mad; if yee annoint certain places of the house with the fat, it will cause the Mice to run away, fearing least the Cat were there, and that is by a hidden propertie. There ingen|dereth in the flesh of a dead Cat certain putrified Worms, the which afterward become a kinde of Flie, that are called Ta|phaeni, the which is a very great enemie to the Oxe, and all o|ther Cattell, for they will run away from them, for if they be bitten therewith, they will in a manner be mad. CHAP. LXXXIX. Of the Hare and his Secrets. THe blood of the Hare being dried in the Furnace, and made into powder, helpeth those much, which are troubled 161 with the stone and gravell, giving it to drink with the juyce of Pelitory. The hair of the Hare serveth to stench bloud in wounds. The Testicles of the Hare dried in a Furnace, and made into powder, and being drunk, provoketh venereous acts. The Gaul of the Hare being distilled with Hony and Aqua vitae, is a miraculous remedy for the sight of the eyes, putting therein every night one drop when yee goe to bed. There is yet a great vertue in the Hare, that if I should reveale it, the world would wonder at it, and therefore I omit it unto the ingenious."},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":" CHAP. XC. Of the Frog and his secrets. THese Frogs are of great vertue in divers operations; for their fat helpeth the Leprosie if ye annoint them there|with, and is a most miraculous thing for those that are burnt, or scalded with water; for if yee annoint them therewith, it will help them quickly, and leave no scar. But if this fat be distilled with Mirrh, and Aqua vitae, and accompanied with Aloes, and the juyce of Brassica Marina, called Soldanella, and thereof made Pills, they will be of so much vertue, that one scruple or two of those Pills being given oftentimes unto one that hath the Dropsie, they shall be helped quickly, and hereof I have had great experience, to my great honour and profit of the Patient. CHAP. XCI. A discourse upon certain stones, and their qualities in Physick and Chirurgery: and first of the Marble stone. THere are a great number of stones that the Majesty of God hath created in the world, of the which I will make mention of some, as well Minerall as Artificiall, because the Physitian as well as the Chirurgian, may be served therof in their affairs, although it be hard to have knowledge of those 162 things, because they are much differing one from another, and grow in divers parts of the world: yea, and although they be brought unto us, yet they are so unknown, that we cannot know the thousand part of their vertues and quali|ties. And to begin, I will write of the Marble, the which is a white stone, like unto Sugar when it is broken, and it is of great vertue in Chirurgery, for when it is brought into calkes, thereof may be made an Unguent of great vertue in this or|der. Take of that calkes, and lay it to steep in fair water, so that it may be covered four fingers, then stir it eight or ten times a day, and then let it wax clear and settle, then pour it off, and put on more, and doe as yee did before, and when the water is settled clear pour it off again, then take of that calkes what quantity you will, and with Oil of Roses make it into an Unguent, the which is marvellous for such as are troubled with heat, for it drieth, and cooleth, and setteth it in good disposi|tion, so that with ease it may be healed. CHAP. XCII. A Discourse upon Lapis Ematites, and his vertues in Chirur|gery. THis Lapis Ematites is a stone like unto the Mine of Iron, the which if it be ground into powder will be red like un|to Sinaper, and thereof thou shalt make an Unguent in this manner. Take Oil of Roses four ounces, Auxungia two ounces, new Wax half an ounce, Turpentine one ounce, Lapis Ematites in most fine powder three ounces, mix them well together in a Copper pan with a small fire, untill it begin to give certain fumes, or smell, and it will be black, then take it from the fire, and alwayes stir it untill it be cold; and then it will be hard like a Cerot, the which is"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"miraculous in healing corrosive Ulcers. Also this stone being in fine powder, and made into a Lineament with Vineger, Oil of Roses, and a little Litarge, helpeth Scabs, and quencheth their heat, and cooleth the blood. Also two drachms of this powder being eaten with Sugar rosate, helpeth those which have inflamma|tions 163 in their stomack with speed. This stone hath also divers other vertues, the which I will leave at this time. CHAP. XCIII. Of the stone of Iron, which some call Loppa. THese stones which the workmen take from the Forge, that are called Loppa diferro, are of great importance, if we may beleeve the Alchimists, because they say, that this stone is the beginning of their Stone, &c. Yee shall understand, that this stone is most necessary both in Physick and Chirur|gery, when it shall be well prepared as it ought to be: and his preparation is in this order. Take that masse of matter and stamp it, and searce it very fine, and then put it into a ves|sell that is apt to resist the fire, and set it in a glasse Furnace for twenty or thirty dayes, and then it will be a red masse, the which yee shall beat into an impalpable powder, the which if thou wilt use in Physick thou maist dissolve in Vinegar, and when it is dissolved keep it for inflammations of the Liver and Stomack, the which thou mayest give with any kind of Sirrup appropriate, for this is a miraculous Medicine against the flux of the body. Also if yee make an Unguent of the said pow|der with Oil of Wax, of Frankincense, and Eggs, it will work strange operations in Contusions and Dislocations of bones, laying it thereon very warm, because it resolveth all altera|tion, mittigateth the pain, and comforteth the place offended. Yee shall understand, that it was never made of none but of us, which ever seek new Medicines and goodly experiences, to pleasure the world with that Art. CHAP. XCIV. Of Lapis Judaicus and his form, and wherefore it serveth in Phy|sick and Chirurgery. THis Lapis Judaicus is a certain stone, the which is like unto the similitude of the Cuckows Egge, and is of a grayish co|lour 164 and rough, and within it is another stone like unto a Nut, and this stone is of a great vertue in his operation; for if it be beaten into powder, and dissolved in distilled Vineger, and then mixed with Sirrup of Saxifrage, and given to drink to those that are troubled with gravell, it will cause them to avoid it in their Urine: and to break the stone, they shall mix the powder with Hony, and lay it on plaister-wise upon the Reines, and it will break the gravell with speed. More|over, this Stone hath two rare vertues, the which I will not write of in this place, but I would counsell those that carry them upon their bodies to have two, a Male and a Female, and look upon them every day once, for of this stone I have seen great experience. "},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"CHAP. XCV. Of Lapis Lazuli and his operation. CErtain wise men in the world that have made great con|sideration of this stone, say, that this is the stone of gold, because it is mixed with Azure, white and yellow, and also other colours; but I find that in many places of the world, they have the Mine of gold, and yet they find no Lapis La|zuli; and therefore it is a signe that it groweth in places where Nature doth produce it in that form. And for that which I have seen of Lapis Lazuli is, that if yee give it inward|ly it provoketh vomit, and helpeth the Quartain Ague: And I have proved to calcine it in the Furnace where they bake Bricks, and when it was calcined to dissolve it in Aqua vitae: the solution helpeth many infirmities, giving it inwardly, and especially maligne Fevers. Also being put in maligne sores, it bringeth them to so good a temperature, that it is miracu|lous, and not credited, except of those that see the experience. And at this time I am seeking to bring it to a certain perfecti|on, the which shall work miracles, and hitherto I have had good successe, for thereof I have seen great miracles that cau|seth the world to wonder: And yet of late I have found an Oil made of the same Stone, that provoketh sleep, and causeth 165 quiet rest, and is marvellous for the sight of the eyes, annoint|ing the head, the eyes, and the stomack therewith when yee go to bed: For of this I have seen an infinite of experiments, and I swear by that I am, that with all the travell that I have had, I never found a better thing then this Oil; for if yee annoint the Gout therewith, presently it taketh away the pain, and inflammation, or alteration, but the reason thereof I know not, because as yet I had no leisure to consider there|of: But by the grace of God, at the next impression I will set forth some notes of their experience that I have seen in the Art. CHAP. XCVI. Of the Flint-stones and their vertues. THe flint is a stone, the which if it be stricken with Iron or Steel it will give fire, and his vertues are great both in Physick and Chirurgery, and also in divers other Arts. First in Physick it hath vertue to dissolve the gravell in the Reins and Bladder, if ye give thereof two drachms with unriped Wine, and this it doth by his proper quality and hidden ver|tue. In Chirurgery it hath great vertue, for being ground into most fine powder, and made into an ointment with Oil of Roses, and Wax, it mittigateth all inflammations, and ta|keth away the pain of the sore, because it cooleth and drieth Moreover, this stone is used of those that make Glasse, to make their composition with their Ashes and Maganese. There are yet a great number of vertues, the which I leave unto the Experimentour. CHAP. XCVII. Of the white stone which some call Allum, Scaleola, or Gesso. THis Allum, Scaleola, or Gesso is used much in Italy to make Lime of, I suppose it to be that which is called Muskovie Glasse, or Lapis Specularis; this is very necessary both in 166 Physick and Chirurgerie, because it is by vertue attractive and drying, and helpeth much against burning Fevers, tempering it when it is burnt like flower with Vinegar, and when it is tempered, lay it"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"presently upon the Reins, and lay it just the length and largenesse, and so let it remain three or four houres, because it draweth like Boxing Glasses, and so lea|veth the Reins cold and eased: and so by that effect it doth great pleasure in those kind of Fevers. It helpeth also in Ul|cers if yee make a paste thereof with common lye, and lay it thereon eight or ten houres, and then change it, for of this I have seen strange effects. CHAP. XCVIII. Of the Stone called Lapis Amiante. THis Stone called Amiante, as all they which have written thereof say, is a stone like unto Cycile, or Allum du plum, but not so white, of the which stone there is found great quantitie in Cyprus, and there they spin it like as it were Flaxe, and doe make thereof Napkins and such like, and when they are foul, in stead of washing them, they make a great fire, and lay them thereon, and so make them clean and white, for the experience thereof I have seen, and that which I have said, is in the Lapidarie of Dioscorides and Plinie, and Petro Andrea, Mathiolus Sanesie. And hereof I will shew thee a mar|vellous strange secret, the which I have proved, and is this. Take of the said stone and make it in powder, and mix it with crude Lead being in powder, as I have shewed in my Ca|prici Medicinale, with Tutia prepared, the composition there|of is this. Take of the stone {ounce}. iiii. Lead, {ounce}. xii. Tutia {ounce}. ii. Mix them and calcine them in the fire, and when they are calcined, beat them to powder, and lay them to steep in strong Vinegar in a glasse, and so let it stand a moneth stir|ring it every day once, and then at the moneths end let it boil on the fire a quarter of an hour, and then let it settle untill it come clear, then take of that Vinegar as much as yee will, and mix it with as much oyle of Roses, stirring it 167 untill it come to a bodie, the which is a precious linament and rare, for if ye annoint the white scall or such like scabs on the heads of young children, it will heal them with great speed. Also for Scabs and Itch in the legs it is excellent, if ye annoint them therewith every night when you go to bed. This Stone ser|veth also when it is dissolved by it self in Aqua vitae and Sugar, for those women that are troubled with the whites; for if they drinke thereof every morning a little, it helpeth them quickly. I beleeve this Stone hath many other vertues which I know not. CHAP. XCIX. Of the Saphire, and his vertues in Physick. SAphires are certain stones, like unto Azures, small, and are transparent, the which if thou wilt use, it were necessary to be cunning in the knowledge of them, for otherwise yee may be deceived. And furthermore, above that which many Phi|losophers have written thereof, I have found two goodly ex|periences never known before, and are these. First to make the heart merrie, and to help the passions of the same, the which ye shall use thus. Take thy Saphire, and stamp it very finely, and dissolve it in Vinegar, or with the juice of Limons, and when they are dis|solved, take thereof {dram} i. with as much of our Elixar vitae, and of Oyle of Honey {scruple} i. and a little of the Julep of Violets, and give it to drink unto"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"those that have the aforesaid infirmi|ties, and thou shalt see miracles of their operation. I hope ere it be long, to set forth a great and strange secret of these Stones. CHAP. C. Of Red Corall. REd Corall is a stone, the which most commonly doth grow upon baked stones or bricks, and to approve it to be so, there is a certain Island of Barbarie, the which is called Tobac|co, the which was sometimes inhabited, but sithence the Sea hath over-run a great part thereof, and so the stones of the houses, and the Bricks were scattered in the bottome of that Sea, and 168 at this time the Genoes gathered a great quantitie of Red Co|rall, the fairest in all the world. I call to remembrance that in the yeer 1549. I being in Messina, a famous Citie in the Realm of Cicilia, I saw a Fisherman cast his Net in the gate hard by the tower called Salvatore; and he took up a branch of red Corall that was grown upon a Brick, and was of such greatnesse and beautie, as had not been seen in two hundred yeers before. So that by this I have proved, that the Corall doth grow upon Bricks, or baked stones, and these have great vertue in Physick and Chirurgerie, when they be dissolved in the juyce of Limons, or distilled Vinegar. For howsoever it be taken inwardly, it comforteth the sto|mack, and maketh the heart merrie, dissolveth the Fever, and not without great cause. For it is so good of nature, that our nature doth desire it. Corall being calcined and dissolved with Aqua vitae, or with our Quintessence of Wine, helpeth very much against Ulcers, because it taketh away the pain pre|sently, and mundifieth, and incarnateth, and cicatrizeth. Of this Corall ye may make Lozenges, or such like, the which are very Restorative. CHAP. CI. A Discourse upon the Stone Salt. THere is found a Salt in the Realm of Naples, in the Pro|vince of Calabria, in the state of the Prince of Besignano, in certain Mountains that are of the Mine of Salt: I doe verily beleeve that this Salt is a fifth Element, because Salt would be called no other then wisedome, as a man may say, taste. And to prove that which I have said, yee may see that the world cannot live without it. Moreover this Salt serveth much in Physick and Chirurgery, for they put it into Clisters, and lay it also upon wounds. But I have found a way to prepare this Salt sweet like Sugar, but yet Salt, and is of such a pleasant tast, that it comforteth them that use it, and this is called Sal conditum Leonardo, the which Salt is good against Worms, and comforteth the stomack, causeth an appetite, purgeth the Urine, with a number of 169 other vertues. And the order to take it is thus. Yee shall take thereof half a spoonfull in the morning at one time, and also use it in stead of Salt to your meat, and season your meat therewith. Also if any have pains in any part of their bodie, annoint it with this Salt, and bind a cloth thereon, and it will be helped. Hereafter followeth the Vertues of certain Mineralls, and mean Mineralls. And first of Vitrioll."},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":" CHAP. CII. Certain Secrets of Vitriol. IN Vitriol are many Secrets which untill this time have been hidden, by meanes of which there may be done many strange and great matters in divers operations, not onely in Physick and Chirurgery, but in many other things. Ye shall there|fore take Vitriol and put it in a pot; and make him sweat untill yee see him weep; the which sweat being taken from him, is a mortall enemie unto sharp Fevers, when it is drunk with sodden or distilled waters. Also if those that have the Etica or Tissick doe drinke it with Mel Rosarum, it will doe them great pleasure, it serveth also to make the hair of the head or beard black. Then if that by force of fire yee cause him to vomit a black liquor, it will be a thing very apt to dissolve any humour, the which in short time will dissolve any pain. For if ye put it into Gangrena, or other putrified Ul|cer, it doth mundifie it with great speed: It mortifieth Warts Chaps, Fistulaes, and any kind of those humours. If it be drunken with Wine or other liquor, it is good against Fevers of any qualitie. Then his Feces being reduced into water with Vinegar, and his Salt being taken out, it is of such vertue, that in a manner it will make men immortall. And above the aforesaid matters, in Alchymie it worketh strange things, for by the meanes thereof they may make the great Amalgam of Mercurie and Mars, wherewith may be done great mat|ters, and happie shall he be that goeth to work that way. For with Vitriol, Mercurie and Mars is made full glad the Master of the Art. 170 CHAP. CIII. Strange secrets of Roch Allum. IN Allum are great vertues, and especially in Roch Allum; for the water being separated from the Feces, and accompa|nied with our Quintessence, worketh most strange cures, and especially in desperate diseases: And the Feces which cannot dissolve, when with fire they shall be brought to perfection, and accompanied with Mars, they shall be apt to heal any sort of Ulcer inwardly, and with speed take away the pain, and not without great reason: for the Roch Allum is Anima Terrae, a firm Element, and that which dissolveth and turneth all things into his nature. Mars also is Anima Terrae, and is that, in which is found all vertue and richnesse: But he that is not expert, let him not settle himself to this enterprise, least it fall not out right; for he that cannot prepare, calcine, dissolve, and con|geale, shall never doe any thing that is ought worth, therefore it were better to leave then meddle. CHAP. CIV. Of Orpiment and his nature. THis Orpiment is a stone, as it were, made of scales, and is of divers colours; there is white, and yellow, and red like bloud; neverthelesse, they are all of Sulphurous matter, the which burneth"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"visibly like Sulphur, of the which I know no use, neither in Physick nor Chirurgery, although that some Chirurgians doe lay it upon sores to dry them, the which they doe for want of reason or knowledge: With this Orpiment, being mixed with Calx viva, and strong Lie, and so made into an Unguent, they use to take away hair: It serveth also for Painters to make a yellow colour like Gold, the which if it be burned, it changeth into another colour. This serveth for in|finite uses in Alchimie; for his sublimation being made with Sul niter, and Tartar, when it is white, and Amalgamed with Quick-silver and fine Silver, and given in projection upon Venus purged, it will make it very fair and white, and much 171 like Lime. Orpiment is dissolved, by way of calcination with strong Vinegar, until such time as his substance be taken away; then let it settle and wax clear, and vapour away that clear part, and in the bottome yee shall find the whitenesse of Sul|phur, the which being fixed with sufficient order, it doth blanch all metals, and this is called the Quintessence of Sulphur Mi|nerall: This serveth for many other uses in Alchimie, the which I will leave until another time: But this which I have written is most true. CHAP. CV. Of Cinaber Minerall, and wherefore it serveth. THis Cinaber is of two kindes, Mineral and Artificial; the Mineral is a stone of the colour of Iron, the which being ground into powder it will be red like bloud, the which is of a great drying nature, by the reason that it containeth in it Sul|phur, it drieth maligne Sores, and being made in a Perfume, it helpeth the mouth being ulcerated, and being made into an Unguent, it cooleth greatly; also being dissolved in Vinegar, it mittigateth the pain in maligne Ulcers, and healeth them in short time; his sublimation being made with Salt and Tartar, blancheth Copper and Lattin like to Silver. This stone serveth also to burnish Metal or Silver therewith. The artificial Cinaber is made of Sulphur and Mercury by way of sublimation, the which serveth for divers uses; as for the Painters, or to write with; also to make drying Unguents, and for fumes against the Pox, with divers other uses, the which I leave at this time. CHAP. CVI. Of the secrets of Salt, and his royall vertue. THere is in Salt a great vertue, and his secrets are of great force, for if Salt be dissolved in the mighty water of Vi|triol, together with Mars, and then caused to vomit with great heat, until it remain in a dry powder, and then circulate it with our Quintessence of Wine and Honey the space of a moneth, 172 the which if the workman can doe, he shall make a miraculous Medicine, which by his vertue and hidden quality, will serve against divers great infirmities, because his nature is to pre|serve the body in his strength, and to discharge all evil humours that may offend Nature. But to speak of some particular thing, I say, that this glorious Medicine doth help the Fever Hectick when they are new begun, giving thereof a little quan|tity with water of Vervane, Agrimonie, and Betonie; with the water of Fennel and Selandine, it restoreth the sight unto those"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"that are obscure; it helpeth also the flux of the body, with divers other things, the which I will not utter in this place. CHAP. CVII. Of the secrets of common Salt, and his vertues. THere are three sorts, or kinds, found of common Salt, the one is natural, the which is found in Mountaines, as in Naples in the Province of Calabria, where are great Moun|taines of it, and also in Spain in the Isle of Anvisa, and this is the Mineral Salt. The second kind is Artificial, as is made in Germany in their Cauldrons. The third kind is also natural of the Sea, which is made upon dry sands in pits, by force of the Sun; but the most sweet and savourest is that which is made with fire, because it is purified and clean: The Salt of the Mountain is of more vertue then all the rest in Physick; for when it shall be calcined forty dayes together in a Furnace, and then dissolved with our Quintessence of Honey, so that there remain no Feces, it will be of such vertue, that in manner it will revive the dead, if you give them thereof a spoonful. With this the antientest Doctors did marvellous things, and they called it the Salt of Wisdome, for he that knew well his vertues would marvel thereat. This Salt serveth also against the infirmities of Oxen. CHAP. CVIII. Certain secrets of Salt-Peter. SAlt-Peter is a certain kind of salt of Urine, the which is taken out of the earth by art, and is most wholsome against 173 divers infirmities; for when it shall be calcined thirty dayes together in a Furnace, with as much Tartar, and then dissolved with our Quintessence, accompanied with the spirits of Cin|namon, Ginger, and Cloves, it will be a most wholsome Me|dicine, and will cause the Professors of the Art to be amazed at his operation, for it helpeth the Hectick, and Dropsie, and divers such like infirmities, the which I will not speak of in this place, fearing that they will not be credited: Neverthe|lesse, those that are disposed to travel on that matter shall find their desire, and reap great fame in the world. CHAP. CIX. Certain secrets of Allum du Fece. THis Allum is made with the Feces of Wine, in this manner. You shall understand, that in those Countries where they make Wine, they put it in vessels, and lay them towards the East, and then in certain space there settleth great quantity of Feces, the which being put into certain bags, and hanged up to dry, the humour runneth out, and the Fesses remain in a hard masse, the which afterward is dried and burned, and the ashes thereof is called Allum du Fece, in the which are found great secrets; for without this certain colours cannot be dyed: It maketh also womens hair yellow, and taketh away all spots or staines, and the like vertue it hath in our Physick, if that the"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"workman were able to prepare it as it should be, for it will transmute one complexion into another. CHAA. CX. A great secret of Gold. GOld, which Alchimists do call Sol, is a metal of such impor|tance, that it is superiour of all the rest in vertue, weight, and prise, and of brightnesse and fairnesse, and is that, with the which may be made a Medicine, that in manner giveth life un|to the dead, when it is prepared with the fire, and accompa|nied with Mercury: Then with our two Quintessences it may be dissolved by and by, and by way of circulation it may be 174 separated from all companie, and when it shall be dissolved, you may give it to help against any great infirmitie, if thou knowest how to apply it conveniently. CHAP. CXI. A great Secret of Silver. SIlver, which we call Luna, is a Metal very bright in white|nesse and next unto gold, for of it may be made marvellous things, especially in dangerous infirmities that are of impor|tance. For being prepared and reduced into his first matter, it may be accompanied with our Quintessence, and make there|of a drink that will be very profitable against the Leprosie, and this composition shall be given in the broth of a Chicken unto those that are Asmatick, for it will doe them great plea|sure, and cure all those that are troubled with the Leprosie. It maketh also womens faces shining and marvellous fair. But when it shall be further prepared, it will restore the sight unto those that are almost blinde through debilitie. Also if it be used in Alchymie, it will work strange effects. CHAP. CXII. Certain Secrets of Saturn. SAturn is that metal which we call Lead, in the which is found great secrets both in Physick and Chirurgery. For when it shall be brought into pouder without fire or other mixture, but onely grinding it in a brazen morter with the spittle of a man, untill it become into fine pouder, it comfort|eth much against all corrosive and malign Ulcers, because it cooleth and drieth miraculously, but when Saturn shall be calcined and dissolved in Vinegar, and his Salt taken forth, and then that Salt dissolved in our Quintessence, will help many infirmities, and especially those that are caused of hu|miditie, and caliditie, because it dryeth and cooleth by his Nature. Also an Unguent made of the calx of Lead, serveth against divers sorts of Sores. Also if the Workmaster were diligent, with Lead, Feretto of Spain, Vitriol, and Tutia, he 175 might make a metal like unto Gold of the Ducket, of the which he might receive a great benefit."},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":" CHAP.

For it resolveth them very vell. Moreover if the workman be his crafts master, he may bring it into such an extream whitenesse, that it shall appear like Luna. Also if he can amalgam it with Mars and Mercury, and give him his cocture, he may draw forth a great quantity of Sol. A great Secret of Copper, as concerning Chirurgerie. Take Sal Niter lb . ii. Roch Allom half a pound, Sal Gem. four ounces, Uitriol Romane one pound, Soot of the Chimney three ounces, mix these together, and distill thereof a strong water according to art, that being done, put the water into a Retort, and for every pound of water, put thereto four ounces of Verdegriese finely cearsed, then set thereunto a Recei|ver, and give it fire according to art, untill all the fumes be come forth, then let it coole, and break the glasse, and take forth that which remained in the bottome, and beat it to pow|der, then put that into another Retort, and put thereon as much distilled Vinegar as the powder weighed, and distill it againe, untill there come no more fumes, then let it coole, and break the glasse, and take forth the matter, and grind it to pow|der, and keep it in a glasse that it take no aire. For this is most marvellous in ulcerated and putrified sores, because it mundi|fieth, cleanseth, and incarnateth, and with great speed bring|eth them to be whole with small paine, or none at all: If ye make an unguent thereof with oyl of Roses, Wax, and Frank|insence, it helpeth all manner of sores with speed. 176 CHAP.

But if it be brought into a Quintessence, and accompanied with our Quintessence, and the Quintessence of Honey, it will be a precious Medicine to restore the sight of the eyes.

More|over if the Alchymists could reduce him to his perfection, it would be a Medicine of great price.

Certain Secrets of Iron. IRon, which the Alchymists doe call Mars is a Minerall, the which is appropriate against divers and sundry infirmities when it is well prepared and dissolved, the which is done in this manner. Take Iron filed in pouder, and dissolve it in strong water, the which solution will be red like bloud, then vapour away that water untill it remain in a red stone that hath no moi|sture left in it, then break the glasse, and grinde it to fine pouder, and wash it with fair water, untill the water remain sweet, then dry it on a great fire, and grinde it again, then put it into a glasse with a long neck, and put thereon Vinegar distilled likewise, and set it in warm horse-dung thirtie or fourtie dayes, and the pouder shall be dissolved into clear 177 clear water, of the colour of bloud. And when that thou seest it all dissolved into water, vapour away the Vinegar, and there will remain a stone blackish of colour, which take forth of the glasse, and grind it to pouder, then dissolve it in recti|fied Aqua vitae, and then shall be finished the solution of Iron Physically, the which thou maist give safely when need shall require, and chiefly against Fluxes of the body, against spitting of bloud, the Emeroids, Scabs, and also for the Le|prosie, and Tissick, and Hectick. And this is the true soluti|on of Iron devised by me, and I promise thee, that this is one of the greatest Secrets that may be found in the world: and his vertues are such and so many, that I cannot expresse them. And therefore I would wish all Physitians and Chi|rurgians, to follow this glorious enterprize worthy of praise, by the which meanes men may come to great perfection in Physick and Chirurgerie, if they can use it when time and place shall serve. CHAP. CXVI. Of the Secrets of Mercurie. QUicksilver is a liquid Minerall and Volatile, the which the Alchymists call Sulphur volatilis, and will accompa|nie with all other Mettals, but with small fire they may bee separated again, and will flie away in Fume, and for that cause the Philosophers call it Servus fugitivus, as a man would say, it can hold friendship with none, but so soon as he hath done his service he flyeth away, as it is seen by Goldsmiths that gild Plate. For when they have laid him on with the Gold, they put it to the fire, and he flyes a|way, and the like it should doe when any man doth occu|pie him in any sort of infirmitie, and the order to calcine it is thus. Take a long pot of stone that is very well glazed, and that hath a neck of a foot and a half long, and that hath a very narrow mouth as is possible, and put therein two or three pound of Quick-silver, then set the same pot in a Sallet of Iron, and lute them close together, and set it upon a"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"Furnace, and give them fire according to Art, until the Quick-silver remain calcined; giving you charge, that your head and receiver be very well luted, least you loose some part of the Quick-silver; and thus in eight dayes it shall be finished, the which shall be apt unto solution: Also this calcination serveth to divers and sundry Medicines: It mortifieth corrosive Ulcers without any pain; the solution is made in this order. Take the said Calx, and put it into a glasse with a long neck, and put thereon distilled Vinegar, and set it in warm sand four and twenty houres, and then give it one walm, and when it hath boiled, pour out the Vinegar, and then if there remain any Feces in the bottome, put thereon fresh Vinegar, and doe as thou diddest before; and this thou shalt doe so often, till it be dissolved into water, and when all is dissolved, evaporate away the Vinegar, that there remain but little in the bottome; then put thereto water of Honey made by distillation accor|ding to our order; and so the solution of Mercury shall be finished, the which is miraculous in many infirmities: It serveth against the Cough, Catarhe, and for those that have their sto|macks putrified with the Pox, causing them to use it with other Sirrups or Potions: It helpeth those whose Milt is indurated; and also for those, that have any sort of Fistula in any part of the body: It is also good for divers other things, the which I will not write in this place, because I would have other men to exercise themselves in the practise thereof, whereby they may find out divers other secrets as I have done.

FINIS. A TREATISE OF CHIRURGERY: PUBLISHED Wih many EXCELLENT EXPERIMENTS AND SECRETS; Found out by the Same Author. LONDON, Printed by G. D. 1652. 1 How that our Physick and Chirurgerie is better then that, the which the Ancients have commonly used. I Here is no doubt, but that our new Physick and Chirurgerie, is better then that, the which the An|cients have used, because it helpeth the sick with more ease and speed, and much more safer, and to shew the truth, the Ancients had never knowledge of our Dia Ar[...]matico, nor of Electuario Angelica, nor of our Pil|lole Aquilone, nor did not make our Sirrupo solutivo, nor yet our magno liquore, with a number of other Medicines found out by me, the which are written in the end of this Book, with the which I have done wonderfull cures, as thou mayest read in my Thesauro de la vita humana, and truly most nece|sary for all Professors of this Art, because therein thou shalt find so many goodly experiences, as it would cause the world to wonder thereat: But to return to our purpose, I say that the Ancients, which had not knowledge of our"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"reme|dies, they wanted also knowledge of the true Physick and Chirurgerie, as by the experience thou mayest see; I say not this to speak evill of those wise and Ancient Doctors, that were Inventors thereof, but I say it to say the truth, and ma|ny shall be my testimony of this truth. Because in many coun|tries, where our works that are Imprinted are come, they be|gin to pactice after our order. And this order of curing, I repute it not to my Science, but a work that God would re|veal unto the world through my meanes, and to shew the truth, there hath been none, that hath found the Medicines for wounds with so much ease and brevitie, as I have done. Who hath ever found the true Remedie for the Gout, for the Quartan, for Fluxes, and all sorts of Fevers, as I have done? Or what is he that ever brought the whole Art of Physick and Chirurgerie into eight small Volumes, as I have done? What is he that ever writ of the Pestilence, and of his qualitie, and remedies, and orders to be used in the same, as I have done? And if there be any that doth not credit me, let them make experience of all that I have said; and I pro|mise 2 you, and swear as I am a true Knight, they shall finde more truth then I will write at this time, being as I have said, a Work given of God, for a universall benefit of all the World, and therefore I exhort every one of the Professors of Physick and Chirurgerie, to follow this our truth, because they are of so great experience, that it seemeth miraculous unto man, as I have seen many yeers ago, to my great ho|nour, and satisfaction of the people of the world, and thus doing and working, thou shalt come to know that our Phy|sick and Chirurgerie is better and wholesomer, then that which hath been used of the Ancients untill this present time. Certain Remedies for all Captains and Souldiers that travell either by Water or Land. THere are three Infirmities, that offend the Souldiers in the camp above all the rest, the which are these, Fevers, Wounds, and Fluxes of the body, the which thou maiest help in this Order following, with these Medicines, that is, our Quintessence of Wine, our Balsamo, Magno liquore, Quin|ta essentia solutiva, and Specie Imperiale, and the order to use them is thus. When any hath a Fever or a Flux, then present|ly, when the disease beginneth, let him blood in one of the two Veins under the tongue, cutting it overthwart, and this thou shalt doe in the evening, then the next morning, take a dose of our Imperiall powder mixt with wine, and this ye may do with|out any diet or straight order, that being done, give him three mornings together, half an ounce of our Quintessence solutive with Broth. But if it be a Flux, and that the Pati|ent is not cured, let him stand in a cold bath of salt-water of the Sea, three or four hours or more, and he shall be per|fectly helped. Then as concerning wounds, as well cuts as thrusts, and as well gallings with arrows, as Harquebusse-shot, and other sorts, thou shalt cure them thus. The first thing that ye shall doe to them is to wash them very clean with Urine, and then dry them well, then put therein our Quintessence of Wine, and presently 3 joyn the parts together, and sow or stitch them close, then put thereupon five or six drops of our Balsamo, and upon the wound lay a cloth wet in our Magno liquore, as hot as he may suffer it, and this yee shall doe the first day. Then the next day fol|low this Order: First put thereon our Quintessence, and a little of our Balsamo, and then our Magno liquore, very hot, and never change that Medicine, and thus doing the wound shall heal"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"with great speed, and in a quarter of the time, that the common Chirurgians are able to doe it, by the grace of God. 4 A short discourse of the most excellent Doctor and Knight Leonardo Phioravante Bolognesse upon Chirurgery, with a declaration of many things necessary to be known. Never written before in this order; whereunto is added a number of notable secrets found out by the said Authour. The Preface. IT is to be understood, that when the Almighty Creator had made the world, he also created all manner of Beasts, as well on earth as in the water, with other Foules, after which, saith the holy Scripture, he created man after his own Image and similitude, and to him gave power over all things created, and with the same grace and reason, through the which he was apt to rule, and have knowledge of all through the Spirit of God, as to have knowledge of all things whereunto he gave his mind and understanding, as it is at this present to be seen among men in the world, that have knowledge of divers and sundry things, all necessary for those that will live in the world with honour: For some understand the Art of Husbandry, which was the first Art used in the world, for so much as without it we cannot well live, as it is plainly seen. There are others that have knowledge in keeping beasts of all kinds, apt or meet for mans body, as Goats, Kine, Hogs, Hens, Geese, Horses, Mules, and such like. There are others that have knowledge in Navigation, without the which also the world would be unperfect, as it is seen by experience. There be others that have knowledge in Cosmograhie, whereby they know divers parts of the world whether men may travell. There be others that have knowledge in the Art of Warres, whereby they may help to defend their Prince and Countries in executing of justice. There be others that understand Astrologie, by the which they know the course of Planets, and their effects: Others understand the Mathe|maticks, whereby they measure land and all other things: Others study Musick to accord voices together: And others understand Physick to help the diseased bodies of humane Creatures, and also Animals of divers and sundry infirmities. There be others that understand Chirurgery, to help all manner of sores that happen unto 5 men: upon which Chirurgery we will write a breif discourse, and pleasant reason, and will leave apart the Science that is doubtfull, because there is no Science in the world wherewith a man may doe good, if therewith be no practise or experience, as a man may say. The which experience is master of all things, as it is plainly seen; and therefore we will give you to understand, which of those parts be best or most necessary in this Chirurgery, either to help those that are hurt, or the Science, or experience. And we will shew the meer truth without any dissimulation or fraud, as I have alwayes done in my Works which are printed, and at this present doe intend to doe, if Almighty God give me grace, and quicken my spirits or wits, in wri|ting that which shall be to his honour, and profit to the world."},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":" 6 What Chirurgery is. CHirurgery is both Science and practise, and to say the truth, he that will know the composition of mans body, must of necessity have some Science, and be Anatomist, although the same Science be a thing to be learned by practise, for I have seen many times, those which were unlearned, to be expert in the Anatomy of mans body, and those were Painters and Draw|ers, the which was necessary for them to know to frame their figures accordingly: and therefore I take not that for Science, but practise: For Science is onely that wherewith the causes of every infirmity is found out, and is of small effect to our purpose, because Chirurgery helpeth not onely the cause, but also the effect after it is known, and therefore I may say, that Chirurgery is no other then a pure and meer practise, and that it is onely necessary for the Chirurgian to know how to stitch a Wound well, to mundifie an Ulcer, and to keep it from putrifaction, and keep it from alteration, so that there run no evill humours unto the place offended, and to know all kind of Unguents that are apt to heal all kind of Wounds and Ulcers, which thing must be known by practise, And likewise to make all manner of Unguents necessary for Chi|rurgery, and for that cause I conclude most truly, that our Chirurgery is onely practise or experience. And that which causeth me to beleeve it is, that I have alwayes seen the most part of Chirurgians, when they should have any case in Chi|rurgery, they knew not what Unguent would help the sore, but many times they prove this, and that, and so continue untill they have found one that is convenient for the sore, whereunto it is applyed, and therefore this is a certain signe, that they know not by Science their Medicine to help the sore, but with experience they search it. Therefore if it be so, 7 it is a sign that I have said the truth, and so conclude, that Chirurgery is a practise to help sores on mens bodies, and also on beasts, when occasion shall serve. What Wounds are. VVOunds are those which in Latine are called Vulnus, and of the vulgar Vulnera, and they are of two kinds, that is, simple, and compound. The simple are those that are onely in the flesh, the compound are those where are cut Sinewes, Veins, Musckles, and Bones, and these are of divers and sundry kinds, And the difference that is among them is, by the variety of the place where they are wounded, and by the difference of the weapon wherewith they were hurt, for some goe right, some overthwart, some long, some broad, some are thrusts or stocate, that offend divers parts of the body. The simple are of small importance, because if yee keep them clean and close shut, nature will heal them without any kind of Medicine. But those, where Veins are cut, have need of some art or practise, with the which they may stop the bloud, and in any wise not to suffer the wound to remain open, but to sow it up very close, so that the Vein may heal. Also those where Sinews are hurt are of great importance, and would be healed with great speed, so that the Sinews may joyn with more ease. But those where Bones are hurt, are of greater importance, for if the Bone be separated from the other, of necessity it must be taken forth before"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"the Wound be healed. So that by this means every one may know what Wounds are, and their kinds. Of Ulcers, and what they are. ULcers are of divers and sundry kinds, and are ingendered of many causes, as hereafter I will shew. But first I will write of those kind of Ulcers that are caused of Wounds. You shall understand, that Wounds, in what part of the body soever they be, being imposthumated, or cancrenated, they change their names, and are no more called Wounds, al|though 8 the originall was a wound. For when it is cancrena|ted, it is called Ulcera corrosiva, because it goeth eating and creeping on the flesh. But when the wound is imposthuma|ted and full of matter, it is called, Ulcera putrida, that is pu|trified, and it is because it is filthy and stinketh. But when it is neither cancrenated, nor yet aposthumated, but that through some evill disposition the wound is closed, and that there cometh in it evill qualities without alteration, then it is called Ulcera sordida, because therein is evill qualitie, and it appeareth but a little, but it is evill to heal. There be other sorts of Ulcers also, the which are caused of divers and sun|dry kinds of tumours, and the most evill and mischievous are those that are of tumours caused of the Pox, for unto those there runneth abundance of evill humours that augment the Ulcer, and they be the worst sort, for they cannot be healed by themselves, except the body be well purged and evacuated of all the humours that are offensive. There is another kind of Ulcer the which cometh of an Imposthume, as well hot as cold, and those are more gentle and easie to be helpt, if yee know the Medicines that are apt to help and dissolve those kind of Ulcers. These are the three kind of Ulcers that commonly happen unto men and women through divers causes, as it is said be|fore, so that these are the principall causes of those malign Ulcers. Of Imposthumes, and their kinds. IMposthumes are a certain kinde of Tumour that are cal|led after divers manners, because they come in divers places of the bodie, as those sorts of Imposthumes that come in the Groin, which in Venice are called Pannoche, in Rome, Tencone, in Naples, Dragonselly, in Spain, Incordi, and the Ancients called them Buboni, and some with other names. There are other that come in all parts of the body, and when they come they cause great pain, and then they ripen and break of them|selves for the most part, and these in Naples, are called Au|trax, and in Rome, Chicholini, in Venice, Un-nasito, in Lumbar|die, Un bungo, and in Spain, Un nacido mui viliaco. There is 9 another kind of Imposthume, that is ingendered of a contu|sion or bruise, and is properly called Apostumatio pro Amaca|tura. In the Head there grow certain kinds of sores that are called Talpae, or Topinare, the which are of small Importance, for they may be healed in short time, and these are seen in childrens heads, that are often troubled therewith, and sometimes in their throats, and for the most part about the eares."},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":" Of Fistulaes, and their kinds. ALl manner of Sores that doe not siccatrize perfectly, and have communication with the inward parts, are cal|led Fistulaes, and we term them in Italian Sofio, or Spiraculo, as yee may see by experience, and this is perillous, when a Fi|stula closeth, being in the body, and specially those Fistulaes that are in the Fundament, for Nature her self doth ingender it for ease. But these Fistulaes that come in divers parts of the body are troublesome, but not perillous: Also all such sores as tarry long before they be incarnated come to Fistu|laes, and many times it cometh through their being long curing, by tenting with their tents, which are the causes that Nature maketh a Callow, and leaveth the sore so hol|low, that it will never be filled with flesh, but so remain hollow, as it is seen easily by experience. There be other sorts of Fistulaes in form of a sore, and they be those sores that most commonly come on the leggs, the which doe purge a long time, and are also very hard to heal, because if yee heal one of them presently, there will rise another hard by it, and that is a kind of Fistula· There is another kind of Fi|stula that is caused of those sores that are upon the bone, the which by his continuance doe break and consume the skin and the bone, and these many times remain Fistulated, but who so taketh away the cause of the sore, nature it self will pre|vail mightily, and will heal it, as may be seen daily by ex|perience, in those that be so troubled. The Fistulaes that come in the eyes, are called Fistula Lachrymosa, and they have 10 some communication with the inward parts, and are evill to be healed. Because first the cause must be taken away inwardly, and then nature will heal it by it self, as I have seen by expe|rience, so that these are the kinds of Fistulaes most known unto all men, and the causes of these Fistulaes are two, and for my part I am fully perswaded it is so. The First is of wounds evill healed, that remain Fistulated. The Second cause, I find to be of sores caused of the Pox, and to shew a truth, yee shall cure them of the Pox, and their Fistulaes will heal of themselves without any other help, as it is daily to be seen. There may be many other causes the which as yet I know not, but these two are a sufficient reason, and to be considered of the Professors of this Art, if they desire to come to any excellency; and therefore I will reason no more of the matter, because the Science, and my experience will reach no further. Of all sorts of Scabs. THere be divers kinds of Scabs, but I will onely treat of those in which I have had most experience, and will set them forth as plainly as I can, that every one thereby may have profit. The first kind of Scab is that which is caused of Ripletion of the body, by eating much meat of great nourish|ment, and then not to digest it, so in that cause nature, to ease it self, sendeth forth that humiditie, and when it joyneth to the skin, it ingrosseth and causeth an Imposthume, and pas|sing to the outward parts, it is alreadie corrupted, and so causeth the Pustulaes, as by experience may be seen, and this kinde is a viscous and fat humour with great humidity. There is another kind of Scab that is alwaies dry with rednesse, and is small, with great heat and Itching, and the same in my judge|ment is caused by much heat of the Liver; and adustion of blood, and"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"may be healed easily. There is another kind of great scab that hath a great dry crust on them, and they grow big, and the same is of the French Pox being new taken. There is another kind like Serpigo, that goeth creeping, and 11 hath a dry crast, and hath no matter under it; and the same is also of the French Poxe inveterated. There are also divers other kinds, the which I will leave at this time, because they are of small importance, and may be helped with those Medicines which are fit for the [...]inds aforesaid. Of Formicola, and his Effects. THose kind of Ulcers that are commonly called Mal di Formica, are so called, because they are a kind of ma|lign Ulcers and corrosive, that goeth creeping upon the flesh, and maketh many holes that are lifted up on the sides, and are red, and these for the most part are caused of the Pox, as may be seen by experience, and these sores are evill to be healed, because thereunto runneth abundance of humours, the which cannot be resolved but with inward Medicines, that is, with exquisite Purgations that purifie the blood, and that cutteth away the evill humours that run thereunto, and cause great alteration with burning. This kinde of sore cometh many times in the head, and when it cometh in that part, it is called Tigna, or the white scall, and to shew that this is the truth, yee may see that those Medicines which heal Formicola, doth also heal the white Scall, for this is a kind of the Pox, as by the Effects yee may plainly see; for if any should say the con|trary, I would answer him again, that this may well be, be|cause the same infirmitie may be taken in the mothers womb, or as soon as the child is borne, it may take it of the Nurse that giveth it suck, if shee be infected with that disease, so that I conclude it may be so. But there are a number of that kinde of disease, which I let passe, because I have seen no ex|perience of them. A Discourse of Wounds, and other kindes of Inward Sores. VVOunds that are within the body, as in the stomack, or belly, or Intestinals, in the bladder, reins, or guts; The Milt, Liver, Lungs, Heart or other Muskles or Arteries, as there be a number, I confesse to know nothing therein, and 12 I will shew you the reason: You shall understand, that when a wound doth offend the Interior parts, the Physitian or Chrurgian, or great Anatomist whatsoever he be, cannot know all those parts offended in the body, for after the weapon is within the bodie, it may turn, and with the point hurt other parts afar off the wound, and offend divers particular parts one different from the other, and therefore I beseech you, ex|cellent Chirurgians, when such a case cometh, how doe you know or discern which parts are hurt? but to say the truth, I beleeve in that case they know all alike, but what should I say of the cure of such a wound, if the Chirurgian know not where it is, nor of what importance, but worketh by imagi|nation, and if that Nature doth prevail, and that the wound doth heal, it is by the good fortune of the Physitian, so that for wounds inwardly I, conclude no other at this time, but will leave it to those that know more then I, and hereafter I will discourse of Ulcers and Imposthumes inwardly, what they are, and how to cure them with our order: yee shall under|stand that there are"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"a number of kinds of Ulcers and Impost|humes that may ingender inwardly, but it seemeth to me so hard to understand, that I can determine nothing that were true, and the cause is this, that we have seen an infinite of Physitians and Chirurgians that have visited one Impost|humated, or Ulcerated, and the Physitian could not know the place, and particular of that Imposthume or Ulcer, if that the Patient do not tell him and shew him, and cause him to feel with his hand, and this is most true, and therefore if one cannot resolve him of outward things, that he may see and feel with his hand, how can he resolve him when one of those acci|dents is within the bodie, where the Patient knows not himself, which is grieved? Truly, I would gladly know what judgement they would give of that matter, for because if there be any Im|posthume or Ulcer in any part of the bodie, the sick shall feel great offence and pain, neverthelesse he cannot tell where it is, nor what part is hurt, so that I conclude, if that the Patient know not, much lesse the Physitian knoweth, and of this I have made a large discourse in Caprici medicinale, for as I have said before, in this case I know nothing. Neverthelesse, when 13 it shall come to his place, I will write a discourse of the order to cure the most part o[...] [...]liters, and Imposthumes, but touch|ing wounds, I will promise no more then I have said before. Also I will write excellent Remedies of great experience, with the which all wounds, so they be not mortall, may be helpt and healed, and also the reasons convenient in that matter. An order to use in healing all manner of Diseases appertaining unto the Chirurgian. VVOunds and all other sorts of sores, are of sundry and divers kinds, as is aforesaid, neverthelesse the order to helpe them is not much different one from the other, if we should say onely the truth without abuse. For yee shall un|derstand, that Nature is the master of all things created, and the Physitian and Chirurgian are helpers of that Nature, as the antient Professors of the Art have affirmed. Then seeing this is so, what need we to make such adoe, having Nature that worketh so gently, if it be not hindered by the Minister, and therefore if we will speak of Wounds, I say, that the Minister hath three operations to doe and no more, and the rest leave to Nature that worketh gently. The three operations that the Master hath to doe are these: To defend the Wound so that there runneth no humours to it, and that it putrfie not, and to keep it clean, and when the Minister hath done that, let Nature work that which she will work well, and if any de|sire to see if it will be so in effect, yee may see by a Dog, for if he hath a great wound upon his body, he healeth it without any Medicine, onely with diet, and keeping it clean with his tongue, and this is most true, that those which doe help Wounds by inchantment, doe nothing but keep the Wound clean, and cause the Patient to keep a diet, and so nature work|eth as well on a Man as on a Dog, therefore let none marvell of this authority of a Dog, although I approve the like of a Christian. But for so much as it would be good to help Na|ture, that it might work with more speedinesse, as Husband|men and Gardners doe, who because they would have Nature to work the better, and quicker in their ground, doe cast thereon divers sorts of dungs, &c. The which is done onely 14 to help Nature to work the quicker, and to conclude, I say, that the Chirurgian should doe the same in helping of Wounds. But as for Ulcers of divers sorts, it were necessary to find out the cause, because they come of divers causes, for when the cause is found, it will be more easie to be helped, because Ul|cers cannot come but by great distemperance of Nature in our bodies, as by great heat or cold, or by repletions of the body. Therefore in this case"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"it is necessary to purge the bo|dy: First, to ease Nature which is offended, and to extinguish the superfluous heat or cold that is in the bodie: That being done, the minister or helper of Nature hath three things to doe. The first is to mortifie or kill the sore, the second to mundifie, and the third to incarnate, and then Nature will cicatrize it, and these three operations are to be used in Ul|cers. Also Imposthumes are caused of divers accidents, in the which it is also necessary to seek out the cause, whereby to know what purgations are fit to purge the body of the superfluous humours, and then the Minister hath three things to doe in that case. First to bring it to maturation quickly, then when it is ripe and broke, to mundifie it well, and thirdly to incarnate it, and these are the three operations that are to be done in an Imposthume to help Nature to work well, and so following this order thy work shall prove well, and goe the right way, as hereafter I will shew in his place, the ope|rations to use in the effect, with the order to help them, and also to make thy Unguents, shewing their quality and vertue, and will prove by reason those things that are doubtfull, so that every one shall be satisfied in that matter. Of Medicines to be used in all kind of Wounds outward, with ease and brevity. HAving declared what outward Wounds are, it is also necessary to shew the order how to cure them, with as much speed and ease as it is possible, and therefore I will be|gin first with simple Wounds that are onely in the flesh, with|out offence of Veins, Sinews, or Bones, although these need no help, but onely to joyn the lips close together, and if 15 need be, to stitch them close, and then let Nature work, the which in short time will heal them, but if thou by Art wilt help nature, thou shalt annoint them with oyle of frankincense once a day. But Wounds, where Veines are cut, have need of present help, and artificiall meanes, and sufficient remedies to help it, with as much speed as may be, so that the Veins cut may joyn again together, without any great offence of the Wound, and that is done in this order. The first thing is to joyn the parts close together, and stitch it well, not as the common Chirurgians doe, but as they doe use to stitch bags, and when it is stitched close, annoint it onely upon the Wound with our Magno l[...]quore, and lay thereon a cloth wet in the same Oil very warm, then take Hypericon with the seed, Mille|folie, Viticella, ana and make thereof a powder, the which thou shalt strew upon the Wound being drest, and round about it, for this Medicine doth assubtiliate the matter that runneth unto the Wound, and taketh it forth with great ease, and without pain of the Wound, for this is the most soveraign Medicine in that case, that Nature with Art may make, and hath been proved a thousand times by experience in divers places. But those Wounds where Bones and Sinews are hurt, have need of great artifice and cunning, because they be of importance; But when the Sinews be onely offended, it were necessary to stitch them presently, as I have said of those where Veins are cut, but not to dresse it with Magno liquore, but instead thereof to take our Ole[...]m Benedictum, and Oil of Frankincense, of each alike, for those Oils doe exceedingly comfort the Sinews that are cut, and when it happeneth that a Sinew hath a puncture, or is cut half way, in that case it were necessary to cut it overthwart, because it shall bring no Spas|mus to the Wound, but if so be then that the Bone be hurt, and that there be any part to come forth, it were necessary to leave the Wound open untill the Bone cometh forth, and then to incarnate it, and this thou shalt doe with our artifi|ciall Balm, for the same serveth for Wounds, and lay there|upon the Cerot of Gualtifredo di Medi, the which healeth it with speed, and so with these"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"orders thou mayest help all the aforesaid sorts of Wounds, and the defensive to use in these 16 Wounds is this. Rec. Aqua vitae made of pure wine, and that will burne all away, and put therein Hypericon, Millefollie, Viti|cella, Betonica, and then wet a cloath in that infusion and, lay it for a defensive round about the Wound, and so thou shalt have thine intent to the great satisfaction of the Patient. Wounds in the head are helped as those are where the Sinews are offended, there are also divers other sorts of Wounds which are helped with the Remedies by us formerly men|tioned. To help Ulcers of all sorts. SEeing that Ulcers are of divers and sundry kinds, it were necessary to know of what kind and qualitie they are, so that thou mayest help them in form and order convenient, and first I will write of the corrosive Ulceras of a wound cancre|nated, mal di Formicola, and other sorts of Ulcers that go creeping upon the flesh. The cure of these kinds of Ulcers is to apply quickly our Caustike to mortifie the evill, the which thou shalt doe thus, wet a little bumbaste in our Cau|stike, and therewith wash all the sore, and then leave it so open twentie four hours without binding it fast, and when twentie four houres are past, wash the sore with strong Vinegar and water, of each a like quantitie, with charge, that there remain none of the Caustike in the sore, then lay thereon butter washed, with a colewort leaf untill the asker or dead flesh fall away, then take our Cerot Magistrale, with a little Precipitate strewed thereon, and then annoint it with Magno liquore, and lay it upon the sore, for this Cerot helpeth all manner of corrosive Ulcers without any other help, and every Plaister will serve three or four dayes, taking them off every twentie four hours, and make them clean, and then lay them on again, and as for the filthy Ulcer that I have shewed of in his Chapter, ye shall dresse them onely with our Unguento magno, the which without any other help will heal them quickly: But ye must every four dayes touch them with Aqua fortis drawn from Precipitate, the which water draweth forth the offensive matter, and leaveth it putrified 17 and clean; and in all other sorts of Ulcers, our Balm artifici|all, our Magno liquore, Oyle of Waxe and Turpentine, the Black Cerot of Gualtifredo, di Medi, our Cerot Magistrale, with Precipitate, are able to help, be they never so evill. The Order to be used in curing Imposthumes of divers sorts. THere be many sundry kinds of Imposthumes that com|eth to mans bodie, that are caused of divers and sundry accidents, and therefore must be cured by divers orders, and with sundry Medicines according to his kind, because some Imposthumes are caused of a contusion or bruised flesh, some are certain griefs, that Nature would discharge her self of, and so sendeth forth that matter, some are caused of cold, others of melancholy humours, and others are caused of cor|ruption of the Pox, and these are the kindes of Impost|humes that commonly come, and hereafter I will shew the order to cure them one after another."},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"And first of those that are caused of a contusion, because it is bruised flesh, for every contusion must be putrified and brought to matter, therfore make a maturative, and bring it to suppuration, and when you know there is matter, pre|sently launce them, and dresse them with this Medicine as well within as without, the which without any other help will heal any great contusion. But you must make the Un|guent fresh every day, and with new Eggs, yee shall mix the yoalk of an Egg with our Magno liquore, and therewith dresse them. And as for those Imposthumes that come by in|disposition of Nature, are certain Sborine, a word so called in Italian, by the which Nature would prevail: it were neces|sary to let those have their cures according to Nature, untill they break of themselves, and when they are broken, dresse them within with this Unguent.

Also for those Imposthumes caused of cold, yee shall use hot Medicines and attractives: The Cerot of Oxicrocii is excellent in those kind of Imposthumes, our Balm artificiall, or the water, and such like things as are tem|perate by Nature. But those Imposthumes that have their Originall of the French Pox, are evill and malign, because their cause is malign and evill, and therefore their cure is with great purging, and to let the Imposthume ripe of himself, and when ye launce it, dresse it within with our Unguento ma|gno, mixed thus, Rx.

The Order to cure all manner of Fistulaes. FIstulaes, as I have said before, are of divers kinds, and caused of divers accidents, and so likewise they have need of di|vers Medicines, and first I will write of those Fistulaes that come of Wounds evill healed, and that have made a callow in that order that Nature cannot siccatrize, and so remain Fistu|lated, and the cure of these kind of Fistulaes is to put there|in a Rupture that doth cut and mortifie the callow, and cau|seth it to fall away, and then with incarnating Medicines, incar|nate them, and siccatize them, and this is the true cure of these Fistulaes. But those kind of Fistulaes that nature causeth to ease her self of some accident, commonly come in the lower parts about the fundament, and they be very perillous, and and not to be healed as they before were. But they must be with purging the body, stomack, and head, the which is to be done thus, First, purge them ten or twelve daies with our Ma|gistral 19 Sirrup, then give them our Aromatico, and drink thereon a little white Wine, then purge the head with a perfume made of Myrrha and Cinaber, after these things be done yee shall rectifie the Liver with some decoction fit for that purpose, as of Lignum Sanctum, or Sarsa parilla, or such like that work effect, for this Medicine doth also help Fistula lachrymosa, that commonly come about the eyes or eares. There be other"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"Fistulaes in form of a sore, which must be helpt with purging, and lay upon the sore our Cerot Magistrale with Precipitate, and annoint it with Magno liquore, for with this Cerot one|ly may all Fistulated sores be healed, for it doth mundifie and afterwards siccatrize it, there be also divers such like matters that are easily cured, if ye apply thereunto those Me|dicines that are appropriate. To help all manner of Scabs. THe kinds of Scabs be many, and caused of divers cau|ses, and their cures are also divers wayes. Those that are caused of repletion of the body, and of grosse blood, the which are caused by eating abundance of such meats as are of great nourishment, the which if thou wilt cure them, it were necessary to purge them with our Sirrupo Solutivo, ten or twelve daies, then give him or her one drachm of our Aro|matico in the morning fasting, and drinke thereon a cup of sweet Wine, then let him sweat three or four times, and after annoint him with our Unguento magno two or three times, and it will heal him of those kind of scabs. Now to cure that kind of seab that is red and small, and causeth great itching, you shall make a decoction of Hearbs, that cool the liver and purifie the blood, as Borage, Bu|glosse, Endive, Maiden-hair, Liver-wort, Harts-tongue, Agri|mony, Citrach, Succorie, and such like Hearbs, then purge with Alves, the juyce of Elder roots, Hiera pigra solutiva, and such like, as doth cool the Liver and Blood, and then annoint them with Unguento di Lithargirio, and therewith you shall help all those kinds of seabs. There be also certain great scabs over all the body, the which are very thick, and those 20 are a kind of the Pox, the which may be helpt with giving them our Pillole contra il mal Francese, the quantity is accord|ing to the discretion of the Physitian, and these Pills yee shall take three times every third day, and then annoint them with our Unguento magno, and he shall be helped. There is another kind of scab that goeth creeping with a dry crust like unto Petigine, and those are the meer Pox inveterated, and and the order to cure them is thus, give them our Sirrup a|gainst the melancholie humour, because it purgeth the blood and cooleth the Liver, and dissolveth that viscous humour that ingendereth that crust, that being done, give them our Aromatico, and annoint them with our Magno liquore, and he shall be perfectly helped in short space. There are other kind of Scabs that come through great cold, and those are healed onely with annointing them with oyle of Frankin|cense three or four times. To help Mal di Formica. THose be certain Ulcers which go creeping in the upper part of the flesh, and have many orifices or mouthes, and these are caused of the Pox being inveterated, the which are cured in that order that the Poxe is, and that is this: First, purge the bodie with our Electuario Angelica, the which pur|geth away grosse and malign humours, and evacuateth the stomack of choler and flegm, this being done, cause the Patient to sweat, for that will assubtiliate the humours, and cause them to"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"come forth, that being done, take our Cerot Ma|gistrale, and strew thereon Precipitate, and then annoint it with our Magno liquore, and lay it upon the sore, and there let it lye twentie four hours before ye change it, then make it clean, and lay it on again, for that Plaister may serve four daies, making it clean every 24. hours, and when the Plaister will draw no more matter, you shall use our Unguento magno, the which will help it in short time. But if it doe happen that this Order doe not cure them, then it would be necessary for them to be annointed with the Unction for the Pox, and to annoint them so long till the mouth be sore, and when that 21 sign doth appear, annoint them no more, for he will spit or vapour at the mouth for twelve or fifteen dayes, and as soon as he vapoureth make a Bath and wash him well, and wash the mouth with Wine, and without all doubt it shall help him God willing; now hereafter I will write of certain things which are used of common Chirurgians, with a brief discourse upon them. Of the Tow which is laid upon Wounds by common Chirur|gians. THe pleggits of Tow, which are laid upon Wounds when they are first stitched is made in this order. Rx. The white of an Egge, Salt, and Rosewater, and beat them toge|ther, and when the Wound is stitched then lay it thereon, because the bloud should stint, and the Wound remain shut, so that it may be helped with more ease. Now touching this, I will shew thee a reason why they use it in their first cure, yee shall understand, that every like desireth his like to succour him, or keep company with him, and therefore the Antients, our antient Professors of Art, willed the white of an Egge to be occupied in Wounds, because it is a substance of flesh like unto the other flesh; and to declare the truth, I will prove it by naturall reason, for yee shall understand, that the white of the Egge is that part which ingendereth the flesh, the skin, and the feathers of the Hen, and the yolk ingendereth onely the guts and other intrals of the Animall, then seeing the white is that which ingendereth the flesh onely, it is like unto flesh, as it is said before; then the Salt is a materiall which preserveth all things from putrifaction, as is seen by expe|rience daily, and for that consideration it was put in this Com|position to preserve the flesh, the Rosewater by nature is cold and dry, and by his coldnesse defendeth the inflammation, and by his drinesse is repercussive, and mittigateth, so that these are the reasons why the said Tow is laid upon Wounds, but I would to God that such things were used, as by their excel|lent operations would help and heal from the beginning to the latter ending and to leave of such trifling orders. 22 Of the digestive with the which they dresse wounds after the afore|said Tow. AFter that the Tow is taken away from the Wound they dresse it with a Composition called digestive, because it digesteth the Wound, although this Medicine be somewhat scrupulous, and against Science, and the reason is this, yee shall understand, that when a man is wounded, the place be|fore was sound, and therefore being wounded, our true duty is to help the same Wound, and not to digest or rot it, as commonly all Chirurgians doe, for by rotting of it in that order it is"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"perillous, and more dangerous to be cured, as is daily seen by experience, and this no man can deny. But now I will follow our Regiment in shewing what this di|gestive is, the which is made thus. Rx The yolk of two Eggs, Turpentine washed {ounce}. i. Oil of Roses {ounce}. ss. mix them in an Unguent, and this is the di|gestive wherewith they dresse it untill the sore have made matter enough, and then they use to dresse it with Medicines much differing from the same; but I marvell much at the diversity of this matter, that this digestive being applyed to a putrified Ulcer worketh divers effects, for it healeth it divine|ly: and moreover, yee shall understand, that if it be applyed unto when they be incarnated, it will sicatrize them marvel|lously, for truly these are things worthy to be known, and he that understandeth the reason, I accompt him to be wise, for if this digestive be laid on fresh wounds it putrifieth and rot|teth them, again being laid on a filthy sore it doth mundifie and heal, and then if it be applyed on a Wound incarnated, it sicatrizeth and healeth it, for this I have done divers and sundry times, the which is to be wondred at. Of the mundificative Unguent wherewith they dresse the Wounds after they are digested to mundifie them. VVHen Wounds are come to digestion, and that they purge, alwayes they change Unguents, and they 23 apply Unguents that have vertue to mundifie the Wound and make it clean, so that it may the better incarnate, and that Unguent is called properly a mundificative, the which is made of Barly flower, and Hony, or Hony of Roses, and Oil of Ro|ses, and this is the mundificative they use eight or ten dayes together, for if the Wound were not well mundified, it would never incarnate well, so that this Unguent is most necessary in that operation, in respect of the ingredient. Of their incarnative wherewith they dresse the Wound after it is mundified. VVHen that the Wound is mundified, so that thereunto cometh small quantity of matter, then it is necessary to apply Unguents that incarnate, so that they may siccatrize with more ease, and this kind of incarnative is in the most use among the common Chirurgians, the which is made of Tur|pentine, Wax, and Frankincense, and a little Oil of Roses mixt on the fire, and this is their incarnative. A rare secret, the which this Authour did send unto a speciall friend of his, being in the warres in Africa, the which helpeth all Wounds, either by cut, thrust, galling with Arrows, or har|quibush-shot, or otherwise."},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"THe first thing that yee shall doe is, to wash the Wound very clean with Urine, and then dry it very well, then put therein our Quintessence of Wine, and presently joyn the parts close together, and stitch or sow them well, but in any wise sow nothing but the skin, for otherwise it would cause great pain, then put thereon five or six drops of our Balsamo, and upon the Wound lay a cloth wet in our Magno liquore, as hot as he may suffer it, and this doe the first day, then the next day follow this order, first put thereon our Quintessence, and a little Balsamo, and then our Magno liquore very hot, and ne|ver change this Medicine untill it be whole. 24 Of those Unguents that siccatrize Wounds. THe Unguents that siccatrize Wounds after they are in|carnated be of divers kinds, although they work one effect in siccatrizing, or causing a skin. The digestion that is written of before, being applyed upon a Wound incarnated, doth siccatrize it with speed, the like doth Diachilon, and Unguentum de Tutia. The Cerot called Gratia Dei, although these be sundry Compositions one differing from another, yet in effect they serve all to this siccatrization, as yee may see by experience, and this they doe, because they be tempe|rate and of good qualities, and so they help nature to work more quickly, and they are called helpers of nature. But these kind of Unguents that work by themselves, as Unguento Apostolorum, the Caustick, Aegypciacum, the Rottery, and such like Unguents as work with violence, and suppresse na|ture, and doe that which nature cannot doe by it self without help, but all those Unguents that are not violent neither in heat or cold, are apt to siccatrize Wounds, and all sores, that are mundified and incarnated.

Another Remedy to stay the flux of bloud in a Wound. VVHen there is a great flux of bloud in a Wound, the perfectest remedy is to stitch it very close, then take mans bloud being dried, and made into powder, and cast it upon the Wound, and bind it somewhat streight, and so let it remain four and twenty hours, and when yee unbind it, take heed that yee remove nothing, and cast on more dried bloud upon the Wound, annoint it round about with our Oleum Philosophorum de Turpentina & Cera, and bind it up again other four and twenty hours, and then bind it gently, and annoint the Wound with Oil of Frankincense, and so in short time it will be whole, giving thee great charge, that yee put in no tent or such like, and then thou shalt see mi|racles.

Of Oyle of Wax, and his Effect. THis Oyle of Wax is marvellous excellent, for so much as it serveth for the most part against all diseases; which Oyle Raymond Lulli doth approve to be a more heavenly and divine Medicine then humane, and is most rare for wounds, but 30 it is not good for common Chirurgians, because it helpeth a great wound in ten or twelve daies at the most, but as for small wounds, it healeth them in three or four daies, annoint|ing onely the wound therewith, and lay thereon clothes wet in the same. Also this oyle worketh miracles against divers diseases inwardly, if yee give thereof one drachm with white wine, and as for those whose hair and beard doe fall away, it is a rare thing and of great profit, and the order to make it is thus. Rx. A retort of glasse well luted, and put therein what quan|tity of Wax you will, so that it be not half full, and for every pound of Wax, put thereunto four ounces of the powder of Bricks, then set it in a furnace, and give it gentle fire untill all the substance be come forth, the which oyle will be con|gealed hard, the which is his perfection, for if you will distill it so many times that it congeal no more, it will be too hot and sharp, and not to be used within the body in any wise, but the first distillation you may use safely inwardly, and make Unctions for any kind of disease where need shall require, and alwaies it will be good, and doe no hurt in any wise in any disease, and therefore this Oyle ought to be had in great regard of all men. To help the Tooth-ach, that is caused of rotten teeth, or that cometh of a descention of the Head. THe teeth being rotten or corrupted alwayes causeth great pain, and many times it cometh of a descention from the head and such like humours, as Catarrs, Erisipella, but let it come of what cause it will, I will shew a remedie of great im|portance, and it is very short, yee shall take our Aqua reale, and hold it in your mouth a good while, and then spit it out again, and this yee shall doe for three dayes together every day once, then afterward it were necessary to wash your"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"mouth in like manner with our Aqua balsami for the space of a moneth, and so the tooth-ach shall be taken away with ease, for this is our Secret, and may be used in all times of the year. 31 Against a stinking Breath.

But when the stench cometh of rotten teeth, use the aforesaid remedie or Medicine that is written for the tooth-ach, the which will make the teeth as white as snow, and will ake no more, but when the stink cometh from the sto|mack, it were necessary to purge the body with our Sirrup Sclutivo, six or seven dayes, and then to take our Aromatico, that being done, take rectified Aqua vitae, and the water of Honey, and oyle of Turpentine, of each alike, mix them well together, and every morning drinke thereof {ounce}. ss. fasting, for the space of of a moneth or thereabout.

To help those that cannot hold their water. THis proceedeth of two causes principally, the first is, of superfluous heat of the body, through the which heat, na|ture doth assubtiliate too much that humid part, and conti|nually doth send it down into the Bladder. The second cause is, that the pores are too much relaxed or opened, by"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"the which operation the Urine doth passe without retention, and these are the two causes why the Urine cannot stay, and this cometh commonly to young children, because they are very hot of complexion, and the order to help them, is this.

But sometime there happeneth a Flux of Urine somewhat like this, and it is not of the aforesaid causes, but of causes much different from them,, for this is in men and women of age, and thi[...] I find to be caused of the Pox that causeth the Flux, and they void certain threds which some call G[...]norea, and the remedie thereof is onely with great purging and sweating, and then to annoint them five or six nights with our Urguento magno, and keep them warm in bed untill ye have en|ded to annoint him, and then go to the stow, and he shall be helpt of that infirmitie. 33 To help those that cannot make water. THe Urine is staid through divers and sundry causes, and the principall are three, of the which one is the Stone that in|gendereth in the Bladder, for alwaies it hangeth down in the neck of the Bladder, and stoppeth the Meatus, or pores that the Urine cannot passe, the which grieveth the Patient mar|vellously. The other is caused of gravell, or grosse and vis|cous humours that cannot passe the pores, and so cause that retention of Urine with great pain. The third is caused of an obstruction or restriction of the pores or conduits, where the Urine doth passe, and so keepeth the Urine within with great pain, so that these bee the three chiefest causes of the retenti|on of Urine The cure of the first cause which is the Stone, is to purge them well, and then to use our most soveraign Remedie that is written in this Book following, the which is of great ver|tue to break the Stone, as I have proved many times, but when this Medicine is not able to break it, then it is necessa|ry to cut it forth, and this is all concerning the first cause. To help the second cause, it were necessary to use Purga|tions that purge the Reins well, and then to give them our Aromatico, and then to annoint the Reins six dayes every day once with Unguento magno, and with this Medicine thou shalt help him perfectly. To cure the third cause it were necessary to purge with aperative things, and then to annoint his Reins, and under the members and belly with our Balm artificiall, and give him to drinke the powder of Hoglice, or Centum pedes, that are found under stones, and by the grace of God he shall be perfectly whole."},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":" To help those that have great burning of their Urine. THe burning of the Urine may come of divers and sun|dry causes, but I find four principall, of which one is the Stone in the Bladder being great or small. The second cause 34 is a certain heat, the which corrupteth the place where it passeth and carrieth forth, as it were, certain long threds, the which causeth that burning. The third cause is a certain viscousnesse, the which holdeth to the bottome of the Uri|nall, and it will not well break, and this is called Gonorrea. The fourth cause is certain fluxes of Urine caused of some kind of the Pox, as yee may see by those that use company with evill women, and take harm, for presently this burning cometh, and therefore this sheweth me plainly, that it is the Pox that causeth the burning of Urine. But if thou wilt help the aforesaid four causes, thou mayest doe it with ease having the true Art of a good Physitian, and the remedie of the first cause coming of the Stone, is to take it forth of the Bladder. The second cause is to be helpt with purging with our Sirrupo Solutivo, and then after that, to use our oyle of Vi|triall compound, taking thereof every morning, {ounce}. i. and so they shall remain helped.

THe Gout is a corrupt and malign infirmitie, and proper|ly ingendered of corruption, as it is plainly seen in those that are troubled therewith, and to prove it to be true, Na|ture doth shew it well, because you may see how great the alteration is of that accident, and seeing that humour is cau|sed of a windie humour, and alteration of the bloud, as is seen by experience, I beleeve the same disposition hath his originall and beginning of the stomack, for so much as all those that are troubled with that disease, the first sign that appeareth unto them, is a great pain in the Stomack, three or four dayes or more before the grief cometh, and then the pain increaseth exceedingly, so that by the said sign, I judge 35 this accident cannot proceed of other place then the sto|mack, and to affirm it better, yee shall understand, that those which are troubled therewith can find no better remedy then to evacuate the stomack from all corruption, and therefore if thou wilt help them of that accident, the first thing that yee shall doe is, to give them a quantity of our Aromatico in the morning fasting, and drink thereon a little white Wine, that being done, it would be necessary to make a fomentation with Nettles that be well boiled in water, and then to"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"an|noint them with our Balsamo artificiato, and so for that time the Gout will be gone, and will remain away for a long time.

A remedy against the Pestilence, that preserveth those that use it. THe Pestilence is a certain corrupt humour, which is the cause of the evill disposition of the air that is corrupted and poysoned, and it is so contagious, that in six and thirty hours it corrupteth the body, and causeth them to dye, and therefore if any will defend them from that infection, they may doe it by the help of God and the Physitian with these Medicines; the first thing is to confesse our selves unto Al|mighty God, and to pray heartily unto him, and then as con|cerning Physicall Medicines, three things are to be used, which may save the lives of many: The first thing is to evacuate the stomack, the second to sweat, the third unction. And touching the first, yee shall use every three dayes our Pillo[...]e Aquilone, for they evacuate the contagiousnesse, and will not let it corrupt the body. For the second, yee shall cable them to sweat by artificiall meanes, for that evacuateth a certain matter very apt to corrupt. And the third is, to annoint all 36 the body with our Balm artificiall, for that preserveth the bo|dy, and defendeth it from the contagiousnesse, so that by these three meanes men and women may be preserved from that vio|lent death. To help Pellaria, that is a disease which causeth the hair and beard to fall away, THis Pellaria is a certain kind of fantasticall infirmity, of the which we by practise doe know the cause, which is by using company with women corrupted with the Pox, and by the same practise we see, that those whose hair doe fall away, doe fall into great infirmities of the Pox, although not all, yet the most part, and therefore if thou wilt help that accident, it were necessary to purge them with our Sirrupo Solutivo eight or ten dayes together, that being done, give them our Arc|matico, and then annoint the place where the hair is fallen away every evening with our Balm artificiall, so that with the use of these three Medicines the Patient shall remain per|fectly whole of that matter, because the Sirrup purgeth the whole body universally, and the Aromatico purgeth the sto|mack and the head, and the Balm comforteth and defendeth the place where the hair is fallen, so that it shall fall no more, for this I have proved an infinite of times. You shall under|stand, that there be two other kinds of Pellaria, the which will not be helped in the aforesaid order, for the one cometh of a great fear, and the other cometh because they have had Mal di Massuca, and their heads be corrupted by that meanes, and for these two I know no remedy, but to let nature have her course."},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":" To help a Carnositie in the Yeard. THe Carnositie that cometh in the Yeard hindereth the Urine so that it cannot passe, and groweth in the mouth of the bladder, and is a kind of matter ingendered in that place, the which is much like unto an Emerode that cometh in the neck of the intestine about the fundament, and because it is a 37 grosse and ulcerated matter, the urine passeth with difficultie and great burning, the which is very painefull unto those that have it, but if thou wilt helpe that inconvenience, it were necessary to purge the body well, and to keep a diet, and to drink the Decoction of Hypericon made with Hony, and use to eat dry meats as much as is possible, and then make certain little wax Candles of Wax and Frankincense, and then make this Unguent.

You shall give them our Sirrupo Solutivo eight or ten dayes together, that being done, give them our Pillole Aquilone three times, the which pills must be taken every three dayes once, that being done, take Sinaber finely beaten {ounce}. ii.

THose Carvoli that come upon the Yeard are of divers kinds, as by reason and experience thou mayest see, but the most part are taken by using the company of lewd and cor|rupt women infected with the Pox, and those are the worst kind, for they are the first originall of the Pox, and of those Carvoli come, Pannochi, or Botches, and certain great Scabs, Pellaria, Aches, and Tumours, and an infinite of other evill effects, and these are the first kind. There are another kind, which commonly come of their own accord by reason of heat, and those are easie to be helped, and are not perillous or painfull. There is another kind, the which is as though it were scorched or burnt, the which cometh through debility of the Yeard, and having company with women, and these are also of small importance. The first kind are certain Ulcers that come upon the end, and some upon the proper substance of the Yeard, and some upon the skin, and the order to cure them is thus. Yee shall mortifie them within and without with our Caustick and when they are mortified yee shall dresse them with our Magno liquo|re, and they shall be whole quickly. But yee shall well note, that many times after they are hea|led before fifteen dayes doe passe, there will come a certaine alteration in the throat, so that they can scarce swallow their 39 meat, and this alteration many times endureth eight or ten daies, and then it resolveth by it self, and that is a certain sign of Pe[...]aria. And therefore if thou wilt avoid that inconvenience that the hair fall not off, assoon as yee feel any of the afore|said griefs, then presently take a quantitie of our Electuario Angelica, and then take our Sirrupo Magistrale, four or five dayes, and annoint thy head ten or twelve daies with our Magno liquore, and so by these meanes the hair shall not fall. Because our Electuario Ang[...]lica, doth evacuate the stomack, and cleanseth the head, and drieth up the matter, the which is already alterated by that disease. Also our Sirrupo magi|strale, doth evacuate the body, and purifie the bloud, and s[...]aketh the fury of the disease. Our Magno liquore preserveth the hair from drying and falling.

The other kind which are like scorching or burning, are helped by keeping them clean, and annointing them with a Liniment of Tutia camphorata.

The cure of one that had the Pox in his head. BEing in Naples, among all other that I cured, there came unto me a Spaniard called, Il Siegnior Diego di Menas, a man of the age of 36 years, of complexion cholerick adust, the which had the Pox, and in his forehead he had a certain tumour, the which had perished a great part of the skull, and was open, and he had been taken in hand of divers men, and none could doe him good: I seeing that took him in hand, and gave him our Sirrupo solutivo eight or nine daies together, after|ward I gave him our Aromatico, and then gave him the roots of Cina in decoction, and then perfumed him with Olibanum, Mastick, Myrrha, and Sinaber, and so by these meanes hee was helped of that infirmitie, but the bone remained bare, and I laid thereon our Cerot Magistrale, and so in short time, the bone did separate of his own accord, and one day I took it off altogether, it was so great, that it covered the fourth part of the head, then presently this Seignior Diego went abroad, shewing what was taken from his head, as divers can testifie. The cure of a Wound in the Head, and in the Hand. THere was a certain Gentleman called Gionan Jacobo Veni|ciane, the which had a great Wound one the head, and in one of his hands, the which being taken in hand of divers Chirurgians, was brought to a very evill case by reason of great alteration in the Wounds; and the Physitian that had him in hand, was one called Realdo Polumbo cremense, the which dressed his head with Wine and Oyle, and the hand with Turpentine and Oyle of Roses. Than I being in 41 company told him, that it were good to change those Me|dicines, because in wounds of the head, those Medicines were not convenient, for the oyle being crude, putrifieth, and the Wine is repercussive· and will not suffer the Putrefaction to come forth that the oyle ingendereth, and for that reason the said Medicine would not be used. And as for the Medicine for his hand, I say that the Tur|pentine is not convenient, for where there is offence of skin, veins, sinnews, and bones, Turpentine is not good, because it is hot and"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"putrefactive, by means of the Oyle, and causeth inflammation, and therefore it ought not to be used.

First, I did put our Quintessence into his wound in the head being cold, and then a little of our Balsamo cold, the which seemed strange to Realdo, and then I laid thereon our Ma|gno liquore, and upon the cloth I laid a little of our secret Powder, and the like I did to the hand, and so in fourteen dayes the wounds were whole, to the great marvell of a number. A great Secret particular for the Flux, and Dissenteria. THe Fluxes of the body are no other but a distemperance of Nature, and are of two kinds, the one is caused of an evill qualitie and distemperance of the Liver, and that is cal|led Flusso Epatico. The other is caused of great heat, Fever, and distemperament of Nature, and this is called Dissenteria, that is a distemperament of the guts, and both these sorts are hard to be helped of the ancient Doctors, as it is well seen by experience of those that practise, for they will help them with repression and restrictives, but that is not the way if wee shall beleeve Galen, the which writes, Fluxus Fluxum curat, the which is most true, for I have cured a thousand of the 42 Flux with giving them our Aromatico, and three or four doses of our Si[...]o solutivo, therefore Galen saith true. But the Dissenteria is cured with giving them our Electuario Angelica, and then every day after dinner stand in a bath of water of the Sea cold two hours at the least, and so in this order thou shalt help any crude kind of Dissenteria in short time, and with great ease, use this as a Secret. The cure of one that was poysoned with Arsenick. THere was a certain man poysoned with Arsenick given him in a messe of Rice-pottage in an evening at supper, and as soon as it was in his stomack, he began to groan, and sweat, and vomit, in such order as it was strange to see, and it happened that at the said time there was a learned man in the house, who seeing this man in that case, suspected him to be poysoned, and so sent for me, and when I came, the poor man was almost dead, then presently I called the wife of the house, and told her that her husband would die, and that she should have the Law for poysoning of him, but if that shee would tell him what poyson shee had given him, perhaps he might recover him again, with many words more: so to conclude shee told him, that shee had given him two grains of Arsenick in Rice-pottage, then presently I called for a cup of Sack, and caused him"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"to drinke, and then he vo|mited and went to the stool, and then I annointed him with our oyle of Hypericon, and Scorpions, all the body over, and still caused him to drinke that he might evacuate that poison, but all his mouth and throat remained swollen, and he did spit great abundance, and I caused him to use that Unguent, and every morning gave him Triacle with Wine, and every three dayes, I gave him a quantitie of Pillule Aggregative, and last of all I caused him to use Aqua vitae compound, and so ere fortie daies he was perfectly whole, and rid of a terrible dis|ease, the which he had before he was poysoned. 43 The cure of an Ulcerated Leg. THere was a certain man of the age of six and thirty years, of complexion cholerick and sanguine, the which had his left leg all ulcerated, in such order that the Physitians and Chirurgians of the Citie would have cut it off, but in any wise I would not consent thereunto, but took it in hand, and gave him first our Magistrall Sirrup in the morning eight or nine daies together, and in the mean time I washed the leg with Wine wherein was boyled Mallows, Consolida ma|jore, Carduus benedictus, and Honey, and then wet clothes therein, and laid them on twice a day, then I caused him to use a decoction of Lignum vitae, and the bark with Iva artetica, Carduus benedictus, Pollipodie, Ripontico, Wine and Sugar, and his common drink was wine and water boiled on the Fesses of the same, and this he used four and twentie daies, then I perfumed him with Cinaber three times, and ere three monthes were past, he was perfectly whole, for his disease came of the Pox, and those sores are commonly called Mal di for|mica.

IN the aforesaid year, in the moneth of August, I was called to visit a noble Gentleman called, Il seignior Don Christ of a|lo, della roca, a man of five and thirtie years, of complexion cholerick, and sanguine, the which was sore troubled with the Gout, and because it was in the beginning of August, our ancient Doctors have forbidden to take any soluble Medicine in that time, in respect of the Canicular dayes. Neverthelesse, I called Armellio, and Leonardo Testa, two excellent Physitians, the which gave their counsell to take no Medicine, neverthe|lesse I proved that the Gout was extream hot, and for that I ordained a cold Sirrup to mittigate the superfluous heat, the which was made of Liverwort, Harts-tongue, Dates, Raisins, Figs, Sugar, and Succorie water, and aromatised it with Musk and Rosewater, of the which he took every day four ounces, 44 and for the alteration of the Gout, I washed it three or four times a day with our Aqua del Balsamo, because it pe|netrateth and openeth the pores, and assubtiliateth and dry-the humour offensive: also I ordained him bread of Barley, because it cooleth the bloud, and is of good digestion, and caused him to refrain from all fat Brothes, and his drink was temperate, and to this one of the Doctors did agree, but the other would not, neverthelesse the Gentleman was content with my advice, then I began to give him the afore|said decoction, with our Soluble Quintessence, and"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"therewith he had every day two or three Stools, and I washed the Gout three or four times a day with our Aqua Balsami, and the first day he began to feel ease, and the second he felt more, so that in seven daies all his pains were taken away, and then I applyed thereunto our Secret of Secrets for that kind of disease, the which in three dayes delivered him; then I caused him to use certain Medicines to defend the Gout from coming again, and so he continued whole to his great satis|faction.

THe Sciatica is a disease so called, because it cometh in that place of the bodie called Sio, and is caused of an e|vill qualitie, and grosse humours that are staid in that place, because they cannot passe down, and this is seen by expe|rience daily, for where that pain is, there is alteration, and the cure thereof is with Glisters, Vomits, Purgations, and Un|ctions, because the Glister doth evacuate those places next unto it, and so easeth the humour, the vomit cleanseth the Stomack, the Purgations doe evacuate the body downwards, the Unctions dissolve the Winde, and so by these meanes thou mayest helpe the Sciatica, as I have done many times to my great honour, and satisfaction of the Patient. 45 A most excellent remedie to helpe the flux of the body, with a cer|taine discourse thereon.

The Flux of the body is caused of a superfluous heat con|ceived in the stomack, the which make a continuall solution inwardly, as yee may see by experience of those that are troubled therewith, for so long as the cause is not taken away, all their meat doth turn into that matter, the which if it be so, that is true which I doe say, that the Fluxes are a distempe|rance of the body, caused of hot and corrupt humours in the stomack, and therefore if thou wilt cure it, it were necessary to extinguish the heat, and to take away the corruption, the which thou shalt doe with the rednesse of Marte Militare written in this book following; for that is the most soveraign remedy that can be found But first yee shall take twelve grains of our Petra Philosophale, with {ounce}. ss. of Mel Rosar[...]m, and then take for four mornings together one scruple of the red|nesse of Marte, with {ounce}. ss. of Sugar Rosat, and therewith thou shalt work miracles.

And then on the fifteenth of June, we set up sail and failed, and 52 when we were in the midst of the gulf between Naples and Palermo, there happened a great mis-fortune, the which was thus. In the Gallie of Si. Giordano Captain General of the Gallies Duke of Florence, it happened that he being at the table with divers Captains and Gentlemen, and as they were, at dinner, a certain Captain being grieved with another, multiplyed words, and took a loaf of bread, and threw it at his face, without any reverence or respect of the said Generall Sig. Gi|ordano. That being done, the said Generall rose from the ta|ble, and took him by the bosome, and gave him five stocadoes in the breast, the which pierced within the bodie, and there he fell for dead: that being done, the said Generall repented himself of his rashnesse, and presently sent for me being in the Gallie of Don Gracia to come and dresse him, and so my Generall caused me to doe with all diligence, and when I came, this poor Captain lay as though he had been dying, ne|verthelesse I dressed him with great diligence, and that Medi|cines which I used were these: First, I put into the wounds, of our Qiuntessence, and upon the wound I dressed it with our Balm artificiall, and gave him a vomit, the which caused him to cast great quantitie of bloud, and then every morning I gave him half an ounce of our Aqua Balsami, and thus within two days after we arrived at Palermo, the Captain was perfectly whole, to the great marvell of a number. After that we depar|ted from Palermo, and went to the Citie of Trapano, where the rest of the gallies were, and there continued four dayes, and then on Saint Johns even, we went to an Island called Fanig|nana, and there kept the feast of Saint John, and then we de|parted with all the army, and went on the side of Africa, and on Saint Peters day we landed in the Gardens of that Citie, and there began to offer battell, and there remaining about 24. or 25. dayes, the army began to be infected with a certain kind of flux, whereof a great number dyed every day. My Generall seeing that called me, and asked if it were possible to find some remedie for that flux, unto the which I answered willingly, and said, I would devise by the help of God some re|medie, because it was my dutie, to labour for the health of 53 the Souldiers of the Emperour, the which thing I did in short time thorow the whole camp; as I will write hereafter in the next chapter. The cure of the Flux, wherewith I helped the Armie of the Em|perour in Africa. BEing as I have said before in the camp, where they were marvellously tormented with a Flux, and many died there|of, and could find no help, although they had Medicines.

A goodly Remedy found out by me for Wound in the head. VVOunds in the head were very perillous in that place, so that if a hundered were hurt in the head, it was not possible to recover ten, and that came through two things, the which were much contrary in that Region, for the day was so hot that it burned all things, and the night to the contrary so extream cold, that it was intolerable, and not to be credi|ted, and so by this distemperance, when the Craneum was unco|vered that the aire might touch it, presently they died with|out any help, then I seeing that, began to consider of the 54 matter, desiring to find some mean to help them, and so stu|dying, it came in my memorie, that the air was cause of their death, as it was in truth. Then presently I commanded all those Chirurgians that were under my jurisdiction that they should not meddle with any wound in the head without my presence, the which thing was done, and as many as were wounded, the first thing that I did, in stead of cutting or launcing or discovering, according to the common order, I joyned the parts, and sowed them close, and dressed them upon the wound with our Quintessence, and with Balsamo, and Magno liquore, and so in short time the most part were hel|ped, and there died none so desperate as they did before, and therefore to my judgement, this was a good invention, and never used of any before, and this order of curing is ve|ry naturall, for Nature doth shew it in hearbs, plants and stones, how that they cannot stand dis-united, then much more our flesh cannot stand dis-united, without great torment of the Patient, for untill it be joyned together again, it is unpossi|ble to be helped, then seeing that is true, it is most naturall for the wound to be joyned together, and to use those Medicines, that where they be applyed, will not suffer the humour to come thereunto, nor putrifie the place that is hurt, and seeing it is so, as by experience is seen, we must beleeve this to be a natu|rall and most wholsome remedie, so that I affirm that the joyn|ing of the parts of the wound in the head, and other parts of the body is most soveraign, and of great satisfaction to the sick, for they never felt pain, nor have no Fever, nor other sort of accident, for of those I have cured a great number with good successe.

IN the year aforesaid, and in the moneth of August, there came to my hand a certain Gentleman of the Embassa|dors of Portingall, that was called Il signior Jari, a man of the age of two and thirtie yeares, of complexion me|lancholie, the which had a putrified Ulcer about the left shoulder, that he had carried above three yeares, and was as big as a hand, and very deep, which could not be healed of the common Chirurgians, nor yet be eased of his pain, then I reasoning with this Gentleman, told him that the cause of that sore, was corrupt and putrified bloud, and by that meanes the Liver received evill qualities, and that if he would be helped, the cause must be removed, the which was hard to be done, because the bloud must be evacuated a little, and then the stomack must be evacuated of moist matter that of|fendeth it, and hindereth digestion of the meat, and will not suffer good bloud to ingender; then will it also be necessary to evacuate the body downwards, that the corruption send not up his vapours unto the upper parts of the body, and hinder the cure of the Ulcer, all this being done, it were ne|cessary to evacuate the humour between the skin and the flesh by sweat, so that all the parts of the body may remain purified, and so by these meanes the Ulcer may easily mundi|fie, incarnate, and siccatrize, and shall be a perfect cure: to the which thing the Gentleman was willing, for he had as willingly dyed as lived, and so in the name of God I took him in hand, and the first thing that I gave him was a vomit that purged the stomack, and took away great part of his pain: then I purged him with our Quinta essentia solutivo eight daies together, that being done, I made him a Fomentation that caused him to sweat well, and to spit abundance, then I caused him to be let bloud under the tongue, and then I annointed all the Ulcer with our Caustick, the which mortified all the filthi|nesse therein, and then I dressed it with Magno liquore, and our Cerot Magistrale, and so with these Remedies in short space the said Gentleman was cured, to the great marvell of 62 the said Ambassadour, and all those that saw it: By reason of that cure came another of the same house unto me, called Il Seignor diego Iaimes, the which was troubled with a difficulty of Vrine, which did trouble him mightily, to whom I gave three times our Petra Philosophale, and once the juyce of Elder Barks, and he was helped: I cured another in the same house of a Fever with our Oyle of Honey, and with Balsamo: The Ambassadour likewise being troubled with the Gout, willed me to take him in hand, the which I did, and cured him, so that in three years after while I continued in Rome he never felt paine, and of these cures I helped an infi|nite in Spaine, as is well known to the Inhabitants thereof. The cure of Ethesia in the beginning. IN the yeare 1555. in the Moneth of March, there came to my hands a young man of Millayne, the which was a Pain|ter, of the age of five and twenty years, the which was fallen into a spice of Etisie, and did spit much bloud with a conti|nuall Fever, whom I cured in this order."},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"First, I let him bloud under the tongue on the right side, and after that I gave him a quantity of our Aromatico with Plan|taine water, because the bleeding taketh away the superfluous bloud of the breast, which nature sendeth forth by it selfe, and the Aromatico with Plantaine water is cold and dry, which are most necessary for that disease, for they evacuate the sto|mack, repercute and mitigateth the alteration, those things being done, I caused him to use our Quintessence solutive to evacuate the body in respect of the Putrefication already con|ceived within the intestinals, also I caused him to use the Quintessence of the Flower of Flowers, and I annointed his stomack with Magno liquore, and also he used our Electuarie of Althea, and so by these meanes he was helped perfectly.

IT happened that a certaine man called Alessandro Orefice, was wounded before my lodging in thirteen places, and there fell 63 for dead, and then by a certaine friend was brought into my Lodging, and there I laid him upon a Table, and took off his clothes, and sowed all those wounds which were to be sowed or stitched, and dressed him with our Quintessence, and Balsa|mo, and Magno liquore, and our secret Powder, and so by those meanes in 15. dayes he was perfectly whole.

And first to make our Petra Philosophale, that helpeth against all manner of diseases that happeneth unto man, or woman, or any other Animall terrestriall. THere hath alwayes been a great questioning among the Philosophers, whether that one Medicine might help a|gainst all diseases or no. The which I affirm, and will approve with sufficient reason, that the Petra Philosophale made of our invention may help against all the infirmities that cometh unto mans body, and two onely reasons I will shew thee with brevity, the first of them is this, that all sorts of infir|mities have their Originall and beginning of the stomack, and to know the truth, yee may see manifestly, that if the body be never so little infirmed, the stomack is also greived: For yee may see how the Animals terrestriall never help themselves of other infirmity then of the stomack, and when they will help themselves, they eat hearbs, the which causeth them to vomit, and this doth signifie, that they have no other infir|mity then the aforesaid, so by the experience of the Animals I approve that the infirmity is caused of the stomack, and this is the first reason. The second is, that all the Medicines, wherein our Petra Philosophale is put, as soon as they are come into the stomack, it draweth unto it all the evill humours of the stomack, and also of the whole body, and mixeth with them, and so natrue sendeth them forth by vomit, or by seege, or both, and so the stomack shall be evacuated of that matter, and the body remain free from all impediments of infirmities, so that by this reason I affirm, that our Petra Philosophale may help against all sorts of infirmities, and to know the truth, I have proved it by experience in all manner of infirmities, and alwayes have found it to doe much good unto all men, and hurt none unto my knowledge, and the order to make this Petra Philosophale is thus. Rx. Sal niter, Roch Allum, Vitrioll Romain, of each two pound. 65 First, dry the Vitrioll in an earthen pan, and then beat it to powder, and mix it with the other matters, and put thereunto foure ounces of Sal gemma, then put it in a goord with his head, and a Receiver well luted, and distill it in a wind Fur|nace, so that yee may make fire with wood, and at the first make small fire, and so increase it according to Art, and al|wayes lay wet clothes an the head and Receiver, and that thou shalt doe, because the spirits of the water shall not flye away. Yee shall understand, that in the beginning of your di|stillation, the Receiver will wax red like bloud, and then turn white; and at the last, when yee give it strong fire, it will turn red again, and those are the pure spirits of the Aqua fortis, and then at the end, the Receiver will turne white againe, and then it is ended, then let it wax cold, and then keep it in a Glasse close shut to make our Petra Philosophale."},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"Then take Mercury, lib. 1.

FINIS. THE EXCELLENCIE OF PHYSICK AND CHIRURGERIE, Collected out of approved Practises, and learn|ed Observations of many expert men in both Faculties. LONDON, Printed by G. D. 1652. To the Freindly Reader, as much health as he wisheth of Soul and Body. MEN many times meddle in some matters, wherein they take more toile then thank for their labours; and he, which thinks in the night that he hath pleased all, shall find in the morning that he hath angered some. So many as know me wel, and whereto I was cheifly adicted within these eight or nine yeares, that is, unto the study and practise of the soul Physick, may now make a question of my medling so long with bodily Physick. But my twofold answer they may take with them for their satisfaction: First, that I keep still Depositum illud, which God hath committed unto me (and sealed the same by mine own spirituall birth, and other mens sanctification) till he that hath said, Goe, points the time, and gives the occasion of my further service in that weighty Function. Secondly, as when I conversed in that calling I was chargeable to none, so (not surceasing the same of mine own accord) I have since, by God his blessing of my labours here|in, as not greatly inriched my self, so not impoverished any: That wherein I have thus continued, seeing it concerneth learning, and an honest mans maintenance, cannot, or ought not to offend any that are well in their wits. These few secrets contained in this Collection, and Appendix thereto adjoyning (which I have reduced into method for his sake that gathered them here and there) cannot, or ought not to scandalize any, that have a sanctified cunning in Physick or Chirur|gery. I must needs tell thee, that I lean more to that safe, speedy, and pleasant kind of curation, with Medicines rightly prepared, then to the carelesse Composition, made by addition of other simples, clogged with more impurities then are in that simple which they labour to cor|rect.

FINIS 1 The Proheme or Entrance into this Collecti|on, contained in the first four Chapters. CHAP. I. What the duty of an expert Chirurgian is. A Good and true Chirurgian is no other, then a Minister, and helper of nature; who hath three operations to perform in curing of wounds: The first is, that he joyn the separated parts close to|gether: The second, to preserve it from pain: The third, that he keep it from putrefaction; all the rest he may leave unto nature, which will work with good expedition: And this is a sure intention concerning the cure of Wounds; never keep the flesh open with tents or pledgets; neither weaken nature by letting of bloud, or by purging, nor yet by streight diet, to cause the pain to increase, but keep the wound alwayes clean, washing it with Aqua Balsami, and lay upon the wound clothes wet in Magno liquore: This is a good and an approved order, whereof whosoever will know more, let him look in Leonardo Phioravante his book of Rationall Se|crets, where he shall be satisfied more at large. CHAP. II. The cure of all manner of Wounds in generall ALl kind of wounds may be healed with these Medicines following (according to the method before mentioned) viz. with our Balsamo, with Aqua balsami, Balsamum artificiale, Quinta"},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"essentia vini Oleum refinae pini, Oleum Cerae & Terebinthi|nae, Magno liquore, Cerotum magistrale, Elixer vitae, Oleum hype|riconis compositum, our secret Powder, all which are set down in the forenamed book, and for the most part, are to be had for a reasonable consideration, at the house of W. I. in Amen Corner. CHAP. III. The cause why Wounds cannot heal quickly. THough there be many more, yet cheifly they may be re|duced unto two causes: The one is, an immoderate and extream diet, which weakeneth the stomack and body so much, 2 that nature cannot prevail to conglutinate or soder the flesh together; and thus, through want of natural heat, the wound falleth to Imposthumation, Gangrena, Fistulaes, &c. and can hardly be cured. The second cause is, the keeping of them too much open, by reason of their tents or pledgets, so that they cannot joyn together again, but grow to Cancers and Fistu|laes, whereupon many times the Patient remaineth lame ever after, or else speedy death is the end thereof. CHAP. IIII. Of Wounds in the head, how they must be dealt withall. ALl wounds in the head must be close joyned and kept to|gether, the bloud must be crushed out, then wash it well with something that hath vertue to liquifie the bloud, as the Quintessence of Wine, or such like; then lay thereon lint wet in Oleum benedictum; this Medicine you shall change in four dayes, but every day once wash the wound round about with that Quintessence, and annoint it with the said Oil, and at the fourth dayes end dresse it again, and let it remain two dayes more, and after that for a day more, and the wound (by the help of God) shall be cured in twelve or fourteen dayes: Thus may you deal with all wounds, save those that are made in the belly; as for all other, either simple or compound wounds, you shall find their cure, methodically shewed, in the Rationall Secrets of Leonardo Phioravante published in English. CHAP V. The healing of a greivous Wound on the side of the head. THe wound was made on the side of the head, almost to du|ra mater, and it was healed in this manner: First there was put into the same the Quintessence aforesaid, then a little Bal|samo, then there was applyed a cloth which was wet in Magno liquore, made very hot, upon which cloth was laid our secret powder, covered with lint, and thus he was dressed once every day till he was whole. You must note, that whensoever the skull is hurt unto dura mater, there must be cast up at the nostrils our balsamo that the smell may pierce upward, and resolve the of|fence. Sometime also in stead of a Defensative, you may an|noint round about the wound, with the foresaid Balm, which preserveth from putrifaction and alteration."},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":" 3 CHAP. VI. A dangerous wound in the head, cured in five dayes. IT was healed very quickly, by putting therein our Aqua cae|lestis and balsamo, and by applying unto the same very hot clothes wet in Magno liquore. CHAP. VII. The cure of a wound on the eare to the skull. A Sore wound was made on the eare, which was cut unto the skull of the head, and was healed in this manner; First, by annointing it with out Quintessence, which caused it to wax ve|ry hot, the space of two hours. After that there was put in our Oleum Philosophorum de Terebinthina & Cera, and so he dressed it every day once. CHAP. VIII. How three wounds in the head, with fracture of the bone or scull were healed by I. P. A Ceriain Miller in Buckinghamshire, called Peter Bull, be|ing sore wounded in the head, whereof one wound was in the midst of the head, with fracture of the skull, another with|in an inch of that six inches long, he had another wound over his eie brow two inches long. Besides the wounds in his head, he had also a great wound in the bow of his arm beside the elbow, so that a man might have laid his three fingers in it, divers of his fingers were also cut, and he lost two joynts. This man bled by the space of seven or eight hours before it was stinted; nor was he dressed untill the next day, but yet he was cured in this manner. First the hair was shaven away round about the wounds on his head, and the wounds were made clean, then was there dropped into the wound, Balsamum sul|phuris, made very warm, and a fine cloth wet therein was ap|plyed to the wounds, and round about the wounds there was a Defensative applyed, thus he was dressed once in 24 hours, and within the space of 3. weeks, he was perfectly helped, that he wore no plaister at all. Also you shall note that upon the wound next the cloth, there was laid cerotum magistrale, of Leon. Phioravante; Forget not, that this Balsom must alwayes be used warm, with a fine linnen cloth, or a peece of Cambrick, and not with any lint. This Balsam did cause the hair to grow 4 so fast about the wounds, that it was fain to be shaven away ve|ry often. CHAA. IX. Of contused wounds on the head, or other parts of the bodie"},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"THe ancient Practitioners have esteemed contused wounds to be very dangerous. For they say contusions must first be brought to putrifaction, and turned into matter which opinion is not to be allowed, for the bruises are to be dissolved with|out maturation, which hath been a thousand times proved in the wars, after this manner to have been performed. Rx. Magno liquore, Oleum benedictum, ana, mix them, and being very hot, wet clothes therein, and lay thereon twice a day, and in three or four dayes they will be resolved. Also the oyle of Fran|kincense, or Oleum Philosophorum de Tereb. & Cera, will resolve any simple bruise in three or four houres, onely by continu|all annointing the place therewith, so fast as it drinketh in any. Provided, that the bruise be not above six or eight hours old, for if it be, then will your work be somewhat the longer before it be finished. CHAP. X. A contused wound on the head healed by I. P. A Young man of 28. yeers of age, that had a great contusion on the head with a staffe, was helped thereof in 9 daies, by applying thereunto Balsamum sulphuris before mentioned. CHAP. XI. A wound in the head, with fracture of the skull, cured by I. P. A Little boy with a fall from a horse, had a fracture in the skull, which was healed with Balsamum sulphuris, & Ce|rotum Magistrale Leonardo. The child did at his dressing, vo|mit very often, which argued the breaking of his scull, yet was he healed in seven dayes. CHAP. XII. To heal wounds speedily. FIrst wash them very well with our Aqua balsami, then joyn them very close together, and lay thereon a cloth wet in Oleo rosini pini, and (through Gods help) they shall be quickly healed. 5 CHAP. XIII. To heal Wounds, by shot, or launce. HE that will cure Wounds that are made with shot, launce, Arrowes, &c. must first wash the Wound well with urine, and dry the Wound well, then let him put therein the Quintessence of Wine, and forthwith joyn the Wound close and hard together, then let him put immediately therein, five or six drops of our Balsamo artificiato, and lay a cloth upon the Wound wet in"},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"Magno liquore, which must be applyed so hot as he may suffer it; thus must he doe the first day. That being done, he must put thereon our Quintessence of Wine, and then a little Balsamo, after that some Magno liquore (as before was said) and so let him hold on unto the end of his cure. CHAP. XIIII. A most singular and wonderfull remedy to heal Wounds quickly. VVOunds must be helped with drying Medicines, (as was noted in the third Chapter) such Medicines, I say, as have vertue to preserve the part offended from putrefaction. This will be performed with our Aqua Balsami, and the Oil distilled from Vern[...]ce liquid; for these two are apt to heal all sorts of Wounds, if yee wash them with the water, and annoint them round about with the oil, for they doe not onely keep the Wounds from putrifying, but they help to siccatrize quickly, and in such manner, as it seemeth marvellous, not onely most profitable for the wounded Patient, but best for the good and honest Chirurgian, who abhorreth in his work to play the Tin|ker, which in stopping of one hole is wont to make three, but with as much safety and speed as Nature and Art will yeeld, to bring to passe all his honest intentions. CHAP. XV. A wound in the eye with a splinter, healed by W. H. A Splinter of wood leaped into the eye of a certain Maiden as she was chopping of sticks. The wound was so grievous, 6 that the gelly of her eye came forth by the space of a moneth; all this while she could neither see, nor take any rest. By the blessing of God, within four dayes after she could thred a needle, and was recovered in this manner. First there was dropped into her eye Balsamum Sulphuris warm, and then a cloth wet therein was applyed thereunto, by which onely she was cured: the Maid dwelleth in Nottingham|shire. CHAP. XVI. A prick in the eye with a knife, healed by W. H. A Child of seven yeares of age had a puncture in the eye with a knife, which was cured by dropping therein Bal|samum Sulphuris warm, and laying a defensative round about it. Another cure performed in like manner, by W. H. ONe George Clarke, servant to the right worshipfull Mr Butler of Denham (then high Sheriffe of Bedford) was healed of a puncture in his eye with the aforesaid Medicine."},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":" An hand flat squatted and contused, healed by W. H. CHAP. XVII. AN old man, called Thomas Smith, of Carlton in North-hamptonshire, Husbandman, in lopping of a tree had his hand caught between two boughs, and was squatted in pei|ces; this contused hand was presently put close together, and annointed with Oleum Philosophorum de Terebinthina, & Cera, and through Gods goodnesse, was perfectly cured in eight dayes. CHAP. XVIII. A wound or puncture through the arme. I. P. A Young man, called Hudson, a Carpenter of Carlton in Northamptonshire, being thrust through the arme with a 7 Pitch-forke, was thus cured. First there was injected Magno liquore (as hot as he could abide it) into the wound; then was there a linnen cloth wet in the same oyle applyed unto the wound, upon the which cloth was also laid a pledget of Cerotum magistrale; this wounded man was healed in five or six dayes. CHAP. XIX. Five wounds in the breast. A Certain man that had five stocadoes into the body was thus cured. First there was put into the wounds the Quintessence of Wine, then were the wounds dressed with Balsamo artificiato, which caused him to vomit, and to avoid much bruised bloud; after that he drunk every morning a little Aqua Balsami, and in short time by Gods help was per|fectly cured.

The end of the second part of this Collection. A Supplement, or Addition unto the former Collection. This Appendix or Addition containeth both Philosophicall dis|courses, of the causes [...]nd cures of divers and sundry diseases: as also many pithie discourses, of the vertues and use of many Vegetables, Animals, &c. culled and translated out of the Phy|sicks and Chirurgery of Sir Leonardo Phioravante, and left to passe forth in print with this Collection. CHAP. I. Of pain in the head. THe pain in the head is an infirmity, whose cause untill this time hath not been sufficiently known, as by mine own experience shall prove unto you. All, or the most part of Physitians in the world doe hold this position, that pain in the head is no other thing, then va|pours ar[...]sing from the stomack, and ascending unto the head, which doe offend membrana, whereupon ensueth pain. Here|in they speak some part of the truth; but (in my judgement) 46 they are not yet come perfectly to know all the cause of this infirmity: for I see, that in the cures, which these Theoricks would perform, it falleth not out according to their expecta|tion and desire, for that they know not the whole, or the principall cause of the malady, therefore what certain Me|dicine can they find out to cure the infirmity? They may per|chance (as the blind man hits the Crow) help they know not what; which thing I speak not to back-bite or injury any of them, but to tell them, out of love that I bear to them and others, the whole and true cause of that, whereof heretofore they have been ignorant. The first cause is putrified bloud in Leonichi: The second is the vapours that ascend from the stomack and offend the head: The third is the humidity or moisture between the skin and the flesh: So that the causes are three, and the remedies as many to dissolve the Antecedent causes. I have now shewed thee the originall and root of the pain in the head, about which thou shalt never more need to beat thy head, or break thy brains, either in seeking the Aphorismes of Hyppocrates, the Commentary of Galen, or the Authority of Avicen, for in these four or few words I have said all. Now of the cure of this disease, as I have experi|mented the same an infinite sort of times in my life, which way soever the cause cometh, work thou after this manner, and thou shalt never sustain blame or discredit. When the pain in the head is confirmed, and that thou canst find no help by common Theorick or Practick doe these things following. First let them bloud on Leonichie, cutting it over|thwart, and"},{"pageNumber":244,"pageContent":"let the Patient spit as much as he can; then the next morning let them take our Aromatico fasting; the next day let the head be shaven, and lay thereon an attractive plai|ster, drawing out the humidity, whereof I have made mention in my Caprici medicinale; in the end, cause them to sneeze, and hereby all the pain in the head will cease. CHAP. II. Of the Catarre, and rhume in the head. THe Catarre is a moist vapour which assaulteth the head, and afterwards falleth down again into the stomack, where 47 it ingrosseth and corrupteth. This moisture hath his be|ginning of the moisture of the Lungs, and untill such time as the Lungs be discharged thereof, the Catarre will continue in his force. This infirmity reigneth more in flegmatick and melancholy bodies, then in any of other constitutions: Such as are troubled with it are not long lived, because their Lungs consume by little and little, and thereupon they are troubled with the Ptisick, and consequently they perish if they be not quickly releived. I will now shew thee a rare secret to cure the same. Take Pulmonaria, and Sena, that is fresh and new, infuse them in wine and water over a small or gentle fire, till the wine have drawn out the vertue; then strain it, and put there|unto our Quintessence, and keep it close in a glasse, let the Pa|tient drink thereof every morning {ounce}. iii. luke warm for twenty dayes together; let him eat good nourishing meats, for they agree well with this disease: If the Patient be not too farre spent, you shall see your cure performed in short time: In the mean while, if the Patient be weak, you shall give him new laid Eggs, and good white Wine: If the humidity be perceived not to be quite expelled and evacuated, then give him our Aromatico, afterward comfort him again with Restoratives and Cordials to make him strong, and no doubt, by the help of God he shall be cured. This method of curing this infirmity, differeth from the common course that Physitians take, which would cure it with diet, bleeding, and mollifying liniments, and causing them to spit, and such like, which are meanes rather to augment the Catarre, then to diminish the same. The second course to cure the descension, that cometh from the head to the stomack. USe these five things if you will cure this disease; 1. our Electuario Angelica. 2. Quintessence solutive. 3. our Pillulae pro descenso. 4. Unguents for the stomack and head. 5. our Quintessence vegetable. The Electuary cleanseth the head and stomack; the Quintessence solutive evacuateth the body; the Pills take away the cause of the descension; the Unguents 48 dry; and the vegetable Quintessence preserveth the body from all ill and noysome infirmities. The Electuary must be taken first in the morning; of the Quintessence solutive you must take a spoonfull in the morning in a little broth and sugar, keeping a reasonable good diet, and doe this four or six dayes; then take the Pills in the evening, and in the mean time annoint the head and stomack with Oleum Cerae, and drink every morn|ing a little of our Quintessence, which if you doe use continual|ly (by the blessing of God upon it) there is no doubt, but the body shall be free from many troublesome maladies."},{"pageNumber":245,"pageContent":"There was a certain woman of the age of 58. yeares, who being greatly troubled with a Catarrhe, was cured by the use of our Aqua preservans morning and evening, and by annointing the stomack with Balsamo. One that was affected with a Catarrhe, and a stitch in the side, was thus cured. He took our Aromatico twice; then he took every morning a spoonfull of our Quintessence solutive with the broth of a Capon, for seven or eight dayes toge|ther; and every night when he went to bed, he annointed his stomack with Oleum Incompostibile, and thereby was soon after cured. A woman that had great pain in her head and stomack, and had her menstrues stopped, with losse of her appetite, was thus helped. First she took two doses of our Pillulae Angelicae; that done, she took every morning a spoonfull of Quinta essentia solutiva, with broth and sugar, for five or six mornings together; after that she took every morning one spoonfull of our Aqua pre|servans, whereupon in short time after she was cured.

The description and cure of the Sqinancie. THis disease is a windy moisture, and a suffocation of bloud, as you may see by experience, that such as are pos|sessed 50 therewith, have a great alteration, or many changes of Fevers, with a swelling in the throat, and many times, if it be not quickly helped, it will choke them, and this is the cure there|of. You shall give them {dram}. i. of the powder of a wild Boares tooth, with {ounce}. iii. of oil of Linseed, and forthwith by the help of God they shall be greatly eased. CHAP. III. The description, and manifold cures, of the disease called Scro|phulae, or forunculi, which some doe call waxing kernels, but rather the Kings Evill. THe Scrophulae or waxing kernels (so called of some) which use to come in the throat, or other parts of the bodies of young children, doe arise and are caused of great quantity of melancholy humours, because that doth for the most part reign in persons that are weak of complexion; for you may easily see, that such as are vexed with that infirmity, are not very quick spirited. These Scrophulae are a long time ere they will come to suppuration; and before they break, and when"},{"pageNumber":247,"pageContent":"they are broken, they cause excessive pain, and are hard to be cured: For all infirmities that come of melancholy, are trou|blesome to cure, or resolve, as you may see in the Quartain, and such like. But here I will shew thee a secret to cure these Scrophulae. First you must remove the cause, and then cure the effects, for otherwise it were impossible to cure them with outward Medicines. This melancholy is purged with our Sir|rup against melancholy, which you must use eight or ten dayes, the dose is about {ounce}. iv. cold; that done, give them our Aro|matico, which cleanseth the head and stomack, and purifieth the bloud. As touching locall Medicines to break it, you shall lay thereon our Caustick 24. houres, which mortifieth and dryeth, for it will draw forth a great deal of moisture; after this annoint it with our Magno liquore untill the escare be fallen out, and when it is mundified, apply thereon the Cerot of Gual|tifredo di Medi, and use no other Medicine, for it will incarnate, and siccatrize without scarre. 51 Another cure for Scrophulae. A Certain young boy of 14. yeares, of complexion cholerick and melancholie, who had Scrophulae in his throat on both the sides, was cured thus. The first Medicine that he took was the Infusion of Rhubarb, with the Trochisches of Agarick, and acetum squilliticum, and water of Maidenhair mixed to|gether, which he used by the space of ten daies. Then was laid upon the Scrophulae, a plaister of Cerot magistrale with Cantharides, which drew forth the malignitie of the Ulcer, and great store of Sanies, being applied for 15 daies toge|ther. This done, I gave him the decoction of Salsaparilla, with a good diet for twentie dayes together. Then I applyed unto the sore a Cerot of Gualtifredo di Medi, which in a short time cured him, that had been vexed with them four yeares be|fore. Another for the same. ANother which was a maid of 13. years of age, was vexed with Scrophulae in her throat, which was also in this man|ner cured. First, gave her the extract of Elleborus niger, with mel Rosarum, which doth very effectually purge the melan|cholie humour. That done, I gave her our Sirrup against the melancholy humour, for eight or ten dayes together, and applyed unto the sores an Unguent of Litarge, boiled with the powder of Scrophularia, thus was shee in short time perfect|ly cured. Another against Scrophulae. REcipe Verdigrease, Pelitorie of Spain, Dock root, the Juice of Leeks, of the Hearb Scrophularis, ana, mix them, and lay on lint, and applie it unto the Scrophulae, but take some care thereof."},{"pageNumber":248,"pageContent":" 52 CHAP. IIII. Of Panaricium, or Panaricies, called the Whitblow. THis grievous and intollerable maladie, (as those know well that have felt them) cometh on the end of the fin|ger, and is an infirmitie bred in the liver, whereof nature be|ing willing to discharge her self, sendeth it to the extream parts of the fingers, and most commonly it cometh to the fin|ger next the thumb, but seldome in the other. The reason or cause whereof is hidden, save that we may conjecture (as wee have said before) an accident in the Liver, which nature sen|deth forth unto those parts to ease her selfe. When it cometh to the end of the finger, that it can go no further, it causeth a sharp and excessive pain; and the accident coming unto that place, not having passage, is so hot, that in short time it putrifieth the sinews, muscles, and cartilages, and in the end rotteth both flesh and bone. The secret of this grief is not commonly known of the most Chirurgians, who with all their learning cannot devise to cure it as it ought to be cu|red. The most part of such as have that infirmitie lose their finger; but if thou wilt quickly help them, follow this me|thod. First, let them bleed on the Liver vein, then let them be well purged. Afterward dresse the finger, with Oleum Sulphu|ris, which will cause some pain, neverthelesse (to have some ease) you must abide it. The next day dresse it with Magno liquore untill it be whole, which will be in short time, as I have often proved. CHAP. V. Of grievous Ulcers in Womens Breasts. FIrst they must be touched with Oleum Sulphuris, then make this Unguent. Take the yolks of Eggs, {ounce} ii. Turpentine, Butter, Barlie flower, Honey of Roses, ana, {ounce} ss. incorporate them all in a morter, and therewith dresse them, untill they be whole. But if they come of any kinde, or spice of the 53 pox this unguent will be to very small purpose. But then shall you dresse them, with our Unguento magno, which is appropri|ate unto the disease, and look that you purge them with our Aromatico. CHAP VI. Of the disease called Astma, and the cure thereof. THis disease which is called the Ptisick, is a certaine infirmity contained in the lungs, which doth harden and dry them in such manner, that such as are troubled therewith cannot fetch their breath. It proceedeth of adustion of the bloud, that can not runne into the veines: and so the lungs"},{"pageNumber":249,"pageContent":"lacking sustenance worsteth that effect. This disease is cured four manner of waies. First, you shall let them bloud under the tongue, cut|ting those veines overthwart, and suck them as much as they can: for it evacuateth and openeth the opilation of the bloud, and easeth the lungs of all that evill matter which offendeth. Secondly, you shall give them a dose of Aromatico, which eva|cuateth the stomack of all evill qualities that offend the Lungs. The third is, to let them eat for a moneth together every morn|ing {ounce}. i of our Electuario de Althea. The fourth, to annoint the stomack every night with Magno liquore. But every ten daies you must take a dose of our Electuario Angelica, where|by thou shalt help them quickly. You must also keep a sober diet, refraining Fish, Porke, slimie things, spice, baked meats, cheese, and such like, which nourish grosely, and do infect the bloud. CHAP. VII. To know the Dropsie confirmed in a man, the cure whereof is shew|ed in xxxii. Chapter of the second part of the Collection THere are three signes or tokens of a confirmed Dropsie. First, look whether the tongue be white and cold: Then whether the yard be shrunk into the belly. And lastly if there do any veines appear on the belly. If you perceive these they are infallible declarations of a confirmed Dropsie. 54 CHAP. VIII. An excellent remedie against Wormes. YOu shall give the Patient two drachms of our Unguento magno to drink with Mel Rosarum, three mornings together annoint the nostrils therewith, and in three daies they will be expelled, were they never so many. CHAP. IX. Of the hardnesse of the Milt, and the cure thereof. THe Spleen or Milt is hardned by reason of superfluous hu|midity, that it taketh from the Liver and Lungs. There|fore if you will help this infirmity, it were necessary to use me|dicines abstersive and drying, which thou shalt do thus First give them our Aromatico, then let them use this Electuray, which is of mervellous vertue in that operation. Take Crocus martis, Scolopendria, ana. {ounce}. i. Spicknard, Lapis lazuli, ana. {scruple}. ii. Cinnamon, {ounce}. ss. mixe them, and make an Electuary thereof with purified hony, and take thereof every morning one spoonfull, and every night (two hours before supper) another spoonfull, and annoint the outward part where the grief is with our Balsamo Artificiato, and in short time the disease shall be cured."},{"pageNumber":250,"pageContent":" Another remedy very effectuall for the former disease LEt them bloud on the two veines under the tongue. That done mixe mustard-seed with the Urine of a Boy, and lay it between two clothes, and apply it to the part affected one night, and then (if thou feele not good ease) use it againe till the disease be gone. Also the decoction of Oak helpeth the swelling of the Milt. CHAP. X. Of the Gonorrhaea or running of the reines, and the cure. THis disease is a corruption caused of the superfluous use of women, that are infected therewith: for such men as have 55 knowledge of them, they receive the said corruption, which afterwards cometh forth of the yard with great paine and difficulty in making water: and moreover in the night, when that part is erected, it causeth great torment: which for fifteen or twenty daies causeth extream paine. This is the beginning of the French-Pox, a fit sauce for that sweet sin of Letchery. It bringeth most commonly paine in the interior parts, or paine in the reines, arms, and legs: insomuch that in fine it cometh to that fowle disease. For such as have this Go|norrhaea, never suspecting or fearing the after-claps, suffer their disease to grow on further and further till their cure will very hardly or never be accomplished. Therefore I wish every man to seek help in time, least by letting it passe, in the end it turne to his destruction. The cure is as followeth. First you shall give them our Aromatico once in white Wine; Then morning and evening for seven or eight daies use this potion following: annointing also the reines and those parts with our Aqua faetida being cold, and in short time they shall be healed. Rx. The whites of four or five new layd Eggs, of fine Sugar, {ounce}. ii. of Rose-water, {ounce}. iii. mixe them well, and drink it morn|ing and evening. This is a rare secret, and often proved, the drink must be drunk cold. CHAP. XI. Of the Emeroids, and their cure. THe Emeroides are an alteration in the Emeroidall veines, caused of a corrupt and putrified humor, whereof nature being willing to discharge her self, sendeth forth by those veines unto the extream or outward parts, where it cannot pass through, and causeth the alteration and inflammtion that is cal|ed the Emeroides. This corruption and putrifaction is caused of the evill quality of the Liver, which corrupteth the bloud, and is the cause of all this inconvenience. Commonly the originall and beginning thereof is caused of the Pox, a thing that must be"},{"pageNumber":251,"pageContent":"considered of in the cure. Now for the cure, it were necessary to help the Liver, to purifie the bloud, to alter 56 the Emeroides, and to discharge nature of that impediment. First, therefore give them our Electuario Angelica, the next day they shall take our Sirrupo solutivo, whereof they shall take five or six doses. Then let them annoint the Emeroids with our Caustick, once or twise, and they shall soone after bee cured. Of the divers sorts and divers effects of the Emeroides, and their cure. BY reason of this disease that cometh alwaies at the end of Intestino, or Longanon, some have marvelous paine about the fundament, some burn wonderfully, and others do scald: which commeth because of the good or bad qualities in some, more then in other some, as experience sheweth. For (as I said) some have such a burning, that they can take no rest, some have such paine as they cannot sit, some have it so scalding hot that it is intollerable. Though this infirmity is more hurt|full in one complexion then in another, and the cure hard, yet you shall cure them in this manner. First, give them Aromatico, then purge the body five or six times with our Sirrupo solutivo. Then give him our fume at the lower parts, three or four times, and then annoint the parts with our Balsamo Artisiciato, for that will dry and take away the paine altogether, and the Patient shall be surely healed. There are divers kinds of Emeroides, but two in principall. The one sort is in the fundament, and causeth great paine when they go to the stoole. The other sort commeth forth of the fundament and are not so painefull as the first. To cure those within the fundament, you shall give the Patient eight or ten daies together our Sirrupo magistrale warm, then let them take our Aromatico once, and use Glisters, wherein is put half an ounce of Aqua reale Phioravante at a time, and so thou shalt help them. The best way for those that are come forth, is to make incision, or to make a little hole in them, that the bloud which is putrified may come forth, and so by evacuation thou shalt help them. Also you shall understand that vomiting is very necessary in the cure of both sorts, because it openeth 57 the veines. Also Oleum ovorum doth ease the paine of the Emeroides very greatly; so doth the oyle of Figs if you an|noint them therewith. The tooth of an horse-fish being worn in a ring on the finger, after the body is purged, taketh them away by a secret and hidden quality, a thing proved more then an hundered times. CHAP. XII. Of the cure of such as were troubled with suffocation of the Matrix. A Certaine woman affected therewith, having much paine and griefe in her stomack, was cured by taking a dose of our Electuario Angelica. Then she used our sirrup against paines of the Mother eight or ten daies, and annoted her sto|mack with Magno liquore every night."},{"pageNumber":252,"pageContent":"A certaine young woman afflicted in manner aforesaid, wanted also her naturall sicknesse; and began to loose her naturall heat, so that nature could not digest, the superfluous matter in her body was thus helped.

To cure a rupture in the beginning. IN every ten daies, once, give them our Aromatico, and every morning fasting give them one ounce of white Tartar in wa|ter or wine, and two hours before Supper you shall take the like: Let your bread be Rie, also you must weare a trusse fit for that purpose, and use this remedie following.

Another for the same. TAke very stiffe and thick paper well gummed, chew it in thy mouth till it be soft: then lay it upon the rupture, and weare thereon a trusse fit for the purpose. Some use to steep the paper in lye, and wring the same out till it be dry, and apply it to the rupture, changing it once in twenty four houres. CHAP. XIIII. Of retention of Urine, and the cure thereof. THe retention of Urine ariseth of many causes; one is gra|vell that stoppeth the Conduits where it should passe; ano|ther is the want or weaknesse of the vertue expulsive, so that nature cannot expell; another is a carnosity, which is an al|teration caused of corrupt and putrified humours; which doe so restrain the pores and Urine, that it cannot passe; there is another, and that is viscosity of the reines, so grosse, that it hindereth the Urine from passing: another cause, which is too too common, is the Gonorrhaea, when it changeth into Stran|guria, that it is a stopping or choking of the Conduits that carry the Urine to the Bladder. All these aforesaid causes pro|ceed of one originall, even of the distemperature of nature, whereof if you ask the reason, you shall"},{"pageNumber":253,"pageContent":"understand, that it ariseth of that filthy beginning the French Pox. That which moveth me to beleeve it, is the observation thereof divers and sundry times, for I have cured many that were infected with the Pox, which were troubled, some with Carnosity (before spoken of) some with gravell, some with debility of the ver|tue expulsive, some with Gonorrhaea: all which when I had cu|red of the Pox, the other distemperatures were therewith also cured. For that disease is the cause of twenty mischiefs, and the reason why many Physitians make a long cure of the for|mer distemperatures is, for that they know not the maine and 59 principall cause of them. But now I will shew thee a true and excellent manner of curing the retention of Urine, which way soever it cometh. First give them a dose of Aromatico, then give unto them our Sirrupo solutivo eight or ten daies, but in any wise keep no streight diet, but a good government, as you do most commonly use, and eat such meat as pleaseth the stomack best: cause them also to sweat, and in short time thou shalt throughly cure them, CHAP. XV. A most excellent remedy to cure the difficultie of Urine. THe difficulty or retention of Urine, caused divers waies, as of gravell, viscositie, exulceration, &c. is in this sort very well and safely cured. When the cause of this difficulty of Urine is in the reines or kidnies, so that it be not a stone in the kidnies, or some great store of gravell, see that thou work thus. Rx. Rognoni of a male Hare, boil it in good Wine, when it is well boiled, stamp it small, and passe it through a strainer with the said liquor wherein it was boiled. Remember that when you boil it, there must not remaine much liquor in the vessell. Then take the said matter that you strained, and put thereto as much purified honey, and boil it on a soft fire untill it come to the form of an Electuary. When it is boiled, put there|to for every pound of that Electuary these things following made into fine powder; of Lignum Alo[...]s, of Cinnamon, ana. {scruple}. i. Cloves, Saffron, ana. {scruple}. i. Musk, four grains, Aqua Rosar[...]m, {ounce} i. our Quintessence, {ounce}. i. ss.

Of the Electuary you must take {ounce}. i. in the morning, and fast thereon four hours, and use some exercise, and in short time thou shalt see a marvellous good work performed. For the Reines will bee strengthned, the viscosity will bee resolved, the pores will be opened, and the Urine will be expelled, and clensed, 60 all which are effects necessary for him to regard, that will with honesty and credite, help the former mallady.

CHAP. XVII. Of Chilblaines and their cures. YOu shall understand, that Chilblaines (as we term them) are caused of no other thing, then of humours dried and restrained in our bodies: For in the winter, when it is cold, the pores doe shut so close together, that the humour cannot passe or come forth, neither by sweat, nor other exhalation or expiration: For that cause, the humours in a young man (who is h[...]t of complexion) may not be kept in, for then nature (which would ease her self) sendeth that exhalation unto the extream 61 parts of the bodie, that is, unto the hands and feet; where remaining, there is caused that alteration, and in processe of time, the skin doth open, and the humour goeth forth, but cannot heal till the Spring, when warm weather cometh in. Howbeit I have found out a Secret to cure them quickly, and with great ease. First, let them bloud, then give them a dose of our Electuario Angelico: After that let them take our Sirru|po solutivo six or seven daies together, not keeping any streight diet or rule. After this, annoint them with Oleum Philosopho|rum de Cera & Terebinthina, at night when they go to bed: and doe thus one week at the least, and then no doubt thou shalt cure them as I have often proved. Also the oyle and wa|ter of Frankincense will do the like."},{"pageNumber":255,"pageContent":" CHAP. XVIII. Of Cornes on the Feet, and the manner to take them away. THe Cornes that come on the feet, are a kind of hard Tumor, or thick excrescence, caused of corrupt and pu|trified humours, whereof Nature being willing to discharge her self, sendeth them to the lower part of the feet, from whence, because they cannot passe, there doe they make a residence: ingendering that kind of tough excrescence, which is grievous and painfull. Many times the cause hereof ariseth of that noy|some disease, Morbus Gallicus, as some write, and then must it be remedied with Medicaments appropriate there|unto. But if they come otherwise, then to take them away, follow this order. When they are in their greatest state, and cause most pain, cut them untill they bleed, then annoint them with our Balsamo artificiato, applying it so hot as you may suffer it; thereupon go to bed. Then touch them once or twice with Oleum sulphuris, and annoint them with Oleum Philosophorum de Terebinthina & Cera, untill they bee whole. Some take the juyce of Sempervivum, and annoint the cornes therewith. Then they take wormwood, and lay it upon a hot tile stone, and sprinkle it with strong Vinegar, and being hot, bind it upon the cornes, and in three or four 62 times so doing (as I have been credibly certified) the cornes will be taken away. CHAP. XIX. Of an Infirmitie that cometh on the fingers ends, and in the feet, under the nails, and the cure[...] of it. MAny men are greatly troubled herewith, and in such man|ner, as thereby they are made altogether unfit to goe. It cometh on the great toe, under the nail, or the side of the nail for the most part; and a man would thinke that the nail grew in the flesh, but it is not so, for the flesh groweth upon the nail; though this infirmitie appear not to be a thing of great Importance (whereof the ancient writers have made little mention) yet is it a thing greatly to be regarded. For many great personages that live easily, and are tormented with the gout, have also this grief in those parts, but the order to cure them is this. First, you shall cut the naile on that part where it most grieveth them; then take it away, which you may doe easily without any great pain to the Patient: for the nail is already separated from the grieved place. Thus when the naile is taken away, touch it with our Causticke, whereof mention is made in our Treatise of the plague. Let it so re|main three daies together, then dresse it every day with Magno liquore untill it be whole, which will be in a very short time. CHAP. XX. Of Erisipela, and the cure thereof."},{"pageNumber":256,"pageContent":"THis disease (as experience sheweth) is caused of an hot and fiery moisture, arising in the face, armes and legs, for where it is, the powers and pores are stopped that the said moisture cannot have expiration, whereupon cometh tumor, as also a shutting and closing up of those pores, by meanes of the ordinarie annointing them with fats, oyles, &c. or o|ther cold things, a common course used of common Chirur|gians. Against this there cannot be found a more present remedy then the spirit of wine, or Aqua ardens, or bathing it 63 with hot water, and if you wash the parts affected with our Quintessence, the Pores will be opened, and it penetrateth and assubtiliateth that humiditie, causing it to come forth. Also you shall find that by drinking our Quintessence and an|nointing the stomack with Oleum cerae, divers are cured of a certain heat retained in the stomack. CHAP. XXI. The cure of Warts. THere is an Hearb called in the Italian tongue Herba di vento: in the juice wherof if you wet a cloth, and bind it upon the warts, they will wear away in short time after. The End of the first Part of the Appendix. The Second Part of the Appendix or Addition unto this Collection, contain|ing the Use and Vertues, of sundry Vegetables, Animals, &c. gathered out of the Physicks of Sir Leonardo Phioravante. CHAP. I. Of the Use, and vertues of Ebulus or Danewort. TAke the buds of this Vegetable, when they are young and green, perboil them in water, and make thereof a Sallad, and give it unto those that have costive bodies, and it will provoke them to the stool. It is an hearb very profitable for the sinews, it comforteth the weak parts, and preserveth such, as are weak in the joynts from many accidents: it pur|geth flegm, which) for the most part) causeth debilitie of the Nerves. Whosoever useth to drinke of a Sirrup made of the Berries thereof, shall not be troubled with the gout, nor any disease in the articular parts. The seed dried is profitable a|gainst all infirmities caused of humidity. 64"},{"pageNumber":257,"pageContent":"CHAP II. Of Eleborus niger, and the use thereof. THe root of black Hellebore being dried and kept two years, may be safely used without other preparation, and may be ministred against any infirmitie that hath his originall of a melancholie cause. Therefore it is most appropriate against the Fever quartane, and lunatick persons vexed with melan|cholie. CHAP. III. Of the Use and Vertues of the Hearb called Gratia Dei, a kind of Geranium, in English, Blew Storks Bill. TAke of Gratia Dei, dried in the shadow, and beaten into fine powder, {ounce}. i. Cinnamon {dram} i. cloves, {scruple} i. wheat flower, lb i. Oranges condite, {ounce} i. make thereof a past with honey, and bake it in the oven with bread, but take great heed that it burn not. Of this you shall give {ounce} i. to purge against ma|ny Infirmities; but above the rest against Scrophulae, against scabs and the white scall. For it evacuateth onely the super|fluous humiditie of the body, it drieth, and is appropriate for such kinde of infirmities. Howbeit you must note, that all soluble Medicines are not fit for one disease or complexion, for chiefly and properly, Rhubarb purgeth choler, black Hel|lebore avoideth melancholie, Danewort dispossesseth the bo|die of flegm, and this hearb cleanseth the bloud, Therefore every one hath his peculiar propertie, though sometime either of them may work upon more causes then one, yet not so pro|perly or simply, but by accident, and in regard of circumstances. Two drachms of the powder of this hearb drunke in wine or broth, provoketh vomit and seege, and is very good for such as are lunatike. It helpeth, or at the least, delayeth the extre|mitie of the Fever. It is good against griefs of the stomack, and wind in the bellie. A decoction thereof made with lye helpeth putrified Ul|cers, if they be washed therewith; for as it purgeth the stomack, so it cleanseth the sore, and healeth it quickly; if you wet a cloth in the said lye, and apply it thereunto. 65 CHAP. IIII. Of Rubarb, and his vertues. THe hearb called in the Italian tongue Lappacia maggiore, or Rombice domestice, is a kind of Rubarb, which among the learned Herbalistes is termed by the name of Rha recentiorum, whereof {dram}. i. when it is new, will lose the body, evacuate chol|ler, as the Rhabarbarum doth. It is very good against oppilati|ons, it purgeth the bloud, and taketh away scabs. You shall have a most pretious Medicine thereof, if you mix the green root with Honey, Cinnamon, Saffron, Ginger, and the powder of Roses."},{"pageNumber":258,"pageContent":"If you rost the root in the embers, and mix it with condited Sugar, it breaketh the Scrophulae, and mundifieth them, and healeth them in short time. Some doe mix it with the gumme, called Ammoniacum, and so doe bring it into the form of an Unguent, and apply it unto the parts affected with Scrophulae. CHAP. V. Of Tithymale, and his vertues. GAther the herrb Tithymale (called Spurge) in the moneth of May; take forth the juyce, and mix it with Sugar ro|sate, or Sugar violet in fine powder; then make of them both a moist past, and keep it in a glasse close stopped. When you purpose to use it, minister two scruples thereof in broth, or any other convenient Sirrup: It purgeth without pain, helpeth all Fevers that come of heat, working not onely by the stool, but provoking sweat also. It resolveth all continuall and quotidian Fevers, when the parties affected therewith be hot, and their sweat cold, yea, though they be brought very low, it will by Gods help deliver them of their troublesome adversary. Laureola doth also move the body by vomit and seege, but it may not be used in any continuall Fever or quotidian, be|cause it will inflame too much. 66 CHAP. VI. Of Soldanella, and his vertues. THis hearb groweth in sandy and salt ground, and is hot and drie; it purgeth by vomit and seege, and is excellent a|gainst the Dropsie, all windinesse and unwholesome moisture in the body. Being taken in Lozanges with Aromatico, the quantity of {dram}. i. it sendeth forth all the noysome waterinesse out of the body, drying and heating those parts in an excel|lent manner. CHAP. VII. Of Cyperus, and his vertues. THe hearb Cyperus, called in English Gallingal, being put in|to new Wine giveth it an excellent good tast and smell, prevailing against inward passions caused of wind: It is good for such as are bursten, for it resolveth the wind: if you take the powder thereof being stamped very small, and make a plaister therof, with other things appropriate thereunto, ap|plying the same to the rupture,"},{"pageNumber":259,"pageContent":"and changing it once every day: Also if the Patient doe once in a day eat of the root, he shall in short space be helped of that disease. CHAP. VIII. Of Elder, and his vertues. TAke the roots of Elder, wash them clean, and scrape them till you come to the wood, stamp that substance, and take the juyce and strain it, boil it, and scum it well, and for every {ounce}. of the juyce, take {ounce}. i. of Mel rosarum, and drink it, for it will cool the stomack, help hot Fevers quickly, and purge the bloud. CHAP. IX. Of the vertues and use of Tobacco. TAke of the green hearb and root lb . iii. ss. stamp it in a a morter with a little salt, then put it in a glasse with {ounce}. vi. 67 of the spirit of wine, and set it thirty dayes to putrifie in horse dung; then distill it in Balneo, till all the substance be come forth; and put therein as much Oleum Sulphuris as will make it tart: then keep it close, and give thereof every morning a spoonfull to any one affected with the Fever, and it will help him in short time. If any man be affected, or greatly troubled with Ulcers or Scabs, let him drink thereof every day one spoonfull, and wash the sores therewith, and in short time it will most wonderfully cure them. CHAP. X. Of sweet Majoram, and his Vertues. TAke sweet Majoram and stamp it, and take of the juice, {ounce}. i. Oile of bitter Almonds {dram}. i. and of Mastick, {scruple}. i. and snuffe it up at the nose three or four mornings together: and annoint the head with oile of Eggs. This purgeth the head of all paines, dissolveth tumors, quickneth the sight, and pro|voketh sleep. CHAP. XI. Of Persicaria, alias Arsesmart, his use and vertues. YOu shall understand that this hearb doth work (in a man|ner) against all infirmities, most strangely to behold. For if you take the powder thereof, and put it upon Copper molten, it will in"},{"pageNumber":260,"pageContent":"the projection become like gold, and will draw it to a small quantity, and make it malleable and soft like gold, ex|cept the colour. Also if you make a strong lie of the ashes of Persicaria, and therein boil yellow brimstone, it will draw out of it quick sil|ver, which is the Philosophers Mercurie. This hearb doth also most notablie preserve a man from many infirmities, if one part thereof be taken whilst it is dry, and one other part of Specie venetiane, being both of them well incorporated to|gether, and used in your meats. 68 CHAP. XII. Of Man, and the Medicines that are made of him. MAn is a rationall or reasonable creature, whereof we have written at large in our book called Phisica del Phiora|vante. But here we will onely write of certain Medicines, that may be made or derived from him, which are for the ease, help, and remedy of divers infirmities, which are in men and wo|men: The reason whereof is very good, for every like re|joyceth with, and helpeth his like, and therefore man serveth for man. The fat of a man is (as every man knoweth) hot, and penetrative, and mollifying, if you annoint the parts there|with, where the sinews be hard, and drawn together, or contracted, therefore it will quickly resolve them. I have made the Quintessence of mans bloud, rectified and circulated, with the which I have done most wonderfull cures, for if you give thereof {dram}. i. it will restore those that lie at the point of death. It is most profitable against those infirmities that are in the bloud, for it correcteth the malignity of the bloud, and pre|serveth it, as well as the spirit of Wine. If you put a little of it into a hogshead of Wine, it will purifie it, and preserve it a long time, more then any other thing whatsoever: So that this Quintessence worketh more effects, for the cure of great and dangerous infirmities, then any other- Also from the liver of a man will be drawn by distillation, a water and an oyle. If the water be drunk every morning together, by the space of a moneth, the quantity of {dram}. i. with {ounce}. ii. of Liverwort water, it will recover such as are half rotten through diseases of the liver, and hath divers other properties, whereof I will not speak at this time. From the flesh of man distilled, there will come forth a stink|ing water, and an oil, which is most excellent to annoint wounds withall when they are badly healed, and that there remain any hurt about those parts, that they are not so sensible and pliant (as they were wont to be before) this resolveth them: and it mollifieth and softeneth all hardnesse of any tumour, of what origin all soever it shall come. 89 From the forepart of a mans scull there is drawn by di|stillation, a water and oile, and a salt, which is most profita|bly used, against the Falling sicknesse."},{"pageNumber":261,"pageContent":"Finally from each other part of man, there are Medicines to be made, for the cure of sundry diseases in man, and wo|man, as you may also read more at large, in the Spagyrick preparations of Josephus Quercetanus published in English by J. H. Practitioner in the Spagyricall Art. CHAP. XIII. Of a Hen, and the Physicall use thereof. SOme write, that the flesh of an hen will dissolve gold, and that the bones will calcine it easily. Another told me, that the ashes of hens feathers, being cal|cined white, doth mundifie, incarnate, and siccatrize Ulcers. Also there is made an excellent Restorative of an Hen, after this manner. Take a good fat hen, and pull her quick, and take forth the guts onely, and stamp her in a morter. Then boil it in xiii. lb . of fair water, with {ounce} i. of salt, till eight pound be con|sumed. That done, passe it thorow a strainer, and distill it in Balneo, till all the substance be come forth. Hereof you may give unto the sick at all times, with a little of a plain and simple Julep. When you finde any evill accident in the belly, you must adde thereunto a little oyle of sweet Al|monds newly made (while it is warm) for then it is one of the best Restoratives, that can be found out, or devised in the world. CHAP. XIV. Of Eeels, and the medicinall use of them. MAny have used the fat of an Eeel against deafness, but to small purpose. But if you distill the Eeles with A|qua vitae, you shall have a most subtill oile, which doth most excellently prevail against that infirmitie. Also if you boil the skins of Eels in strong Lie untill they be dissolved, then strein it and boil it to a thickness, 90 and it will be a most strong glew for wood or other works. Also if you annoint a corroding Ulcer therewith, it will greatly represse the rage thereof, and comfort it. CHAP. XV. Of the Barbill, and to what use shee serveth in Medicine. IN the moneth of May the Barbill hath eggs which are of a soluble quality, and of some those eggs being eaten, they shall be provoked to vomit."},{"pageNumber":262,"pageContent":"They have a qualitie contrary to other purgers, they must be dried in the sun, mixed with a little Sena, and then mini|stred in wine or water that is sodden. When it hath well wrought, the Patients must eat good meat to nourish them, and may drinke wine, and (when they are disposed thereto) suffer them to sleep. CHAP. XVI. Of Bees, and their Medicinall Use. BEes are of nature hot and moist, having a generative propertie. For if they be given to any barren creature, they shall conceive in short time after. Also if you lay dead Bees in a drie place to putrifie, wet|ting them sometime with wine, they will revive again, though not as they were before, but they will be much bigger, and of another form. These Bees, if you bring into powder with as much Cantha|rides, and boil them with a little oyle of Cammomil, and an|noint any part where the hair is fallen away, it shall quickly come again, and in a short space, a most strange thing to be|hold. CHAP. XVII. Of Frogs, and their use. THe skins of Frogs being boiled, and made into the form of a plaister with wax and frankincense, is very profita|ble for such as have any malign or troublesome accident a|bout their legs through heat. 91 The fat of Frogs is a wonderfull Medicine against Fucce sacro, or S. Anthonies fire, a disease happening unto children and others through the great heat that is in their bloud. CHAP. XVIII. Of Centum-pedes, called in English Sowes. IF you minister the powder of these creatures in wine, it hath many excellent properties, but chiefly it hath been expe|rienced greatly to prevail against the stitch in the side, for it will help that grief presently. If you burn the little crieking creature, called a Cricket, and minister the powder thereof, in some Dieuretick liquor, it provoketh Urine. Mallows, Alkakengi, Centum-nodi, Gentum-grana, and the roots of Rapes are of like propertie, being handled and used ac|cording to Art."},{"pageNumber":263,"pageContent":"There are oftentimes found in standing pools, and putrified waters, certain small creatures, which are round like a cherry, having a tail and two feet, which are in Lombardie called Co|mazzi, Take these, and distill thereof a water or liquor, wherewith you may very soon consume or break iron a very great Secret observed in nature. CHAP. XIX. Of the Rosin or Gum called Tacca Mahacca, and the use thereof. TAke thereof as much as you will, distill it in a retort of glasse, and from it there will come both oyle and water, of which I have seen divers Medicines made against sundry diseases. Annoint the belly with this oyle cold, when you go to bed, and it helpeth against the cruditie of the Matrix. If the genitall part of the man be annointed therewith before the act of generation, the woman shall be the more fit for conception, for by this meanes some kind of sterilitie is taken away. It helpeth and easeth pain in the head, proceeding of a cold stomack. 92 It helpeth digestion, and resolveth pain throughout the body in what part soever they shall come, specially when they have their beginning of cold. The water hereof, dissolveth wind in the stomack, helpeth di|gestion, provoketh urine, mittigateth all fevers that come of cold. CHAP. XX. Of the Gum Caranna, and the Medicinall properties of it. TAke it, and distill it in a retort with the yolks and whites of eggs, and there will come forth oyle and water, the oyle whereof will be black, and the water red. The water of Caranna helpeth Chilblains, and all chops or clefts in the lips arising of cold in the winter. It is a great ease, for the sore breasts of women that give suck. The oyle worketh wonderfull effects in wounds of the head, arm or legs. Annoint a simple wound therewith once or twice, and it will very speedily be healed. Take a quantity of this Gum, and mix it with as much of the seed of water-cresses, and the white of an egg, and make thereof a Cerot to apply unto a Rupture, wherewith it will in short time be healed, all other circumstances being also ob|served."},{"pageNumber":264,"pageContent":" CHAP. XXI. Of liquid Amber, and the Medicinall vertues thereof. TAke liquid Amber, and distill it in a Retort, and from thence there will come a red oyle. This oyle is used against all indispositions of cold, and moisture, or wind. The same healeth scabs, and is good for wounds. If you annoint the stomack therewith, it will exceedingly comfort the same, for it is a thing uncorruptible, and like un|to Balsamum. FINIS. ONE Hundred and Fourteen EXPERIMENTS AND CURES, Of the Famous Physitian THEOPHRASTUS PARACELSUS. VVhereunto is added certain excellent Works, by B. G. a Portu Aquitano. Also certain Secrets of Isaac Hollandus, Concerning the Vegetall and Animall Work. Likewise the Spagyrick Antidotary for Gun|shot, by Iosephus Quirsitanus. LONDON, Printed by G. D. MDCLII. An Apologeticall Preface of Mr. Bar|nard G. Londrada A Portu Aquitanus, unto the Book of Experiments of Paracelsus, wherein it is proved, that sick bodies, stuffed and filled with the seeds of diseases, can hardly be cured without metalline Medicines; contrary to the Writings of some, which deny, that Metals (after what sort or manner soever they be prepared) may profit or help the nature of man. IN sacred Scripture (gentle Reader) among others, we find this law, full of Christian love and Charity, Thou shalt restore again the wandering or straying Oxe, or Asse of thy Neighbours unto him; Deut. 22.8. By which saw the eternall God would, as by an evident argument, confirm and establish amongst us mu|tuall love and amity: For if in this sort Gods lawes doe command us to take care of the straying Cattle of our enemies, how much more then, doe they will us to help the miserable case, and great dangers, of the bodies of our freinds, and to restore their health? Wherefore, when as I (together with Theophrastus Paracelsus and other excellent men)"},{"pageNumber":265,"pageContent":"understood the errours of many Physi|tians of our time, I began to devise with my self, by what means I might attain to the knowledge of true Physick, which is derived out of the light of nature, not out of the dark writings of the Heathen. And I judged it to be necessary to travell, and to goe unto farre places to seek out learning and knowledge, and not to hope or look for it, sitting at home idlely. I prepared my self therefore to my journy, and with long travell and labour have searched out, and learned those things, which for Christian love sake I can no longer keep silent, that I might call back the wandering children into the path of true doctrine; and ha|ving declared my journy and labours, they also being excused and defended, which are laid open unto all manner of slanders, by those which so greatly com|mend the Heathenish Physick, whose deceits in some part I will indeavour to disclose; I will afterward declare what those, that are desirous of true and na|turall Physick, are to look for at my hands, and what Books of true Physick I have gathered together in sundry places, being moved with compassion towards those that goe astray, I will communicate and set forth for their publike profit and commodity. But first, the matter so requireth, that to avoid the hatred of the common sort, as well from my self, as from all other favourers of the Art of Separation, I should duly answer unto the adversaries, whose frowardnesse and malice is such, that they will with proud words annihilate, reject, and con|demn others inventions, which they themselves see and perceive they may use with great successe and profit: and yet they in the mean season arrogate unto themselves the commendations due unto the Authours, and with a lying kind of stealth, rob the inventers of Arts of their due honour, which is a subtill kind of craft, springing out of the deceits of the old Serpent. For when as reports are spread of the strange cures of sundry greivous diseases, which are wrought by the benefit of tinctures, and vegetall, and minerall spirits, by the cunning and labour of those whom the common sort at this day call Chymists, or Alchymists; by and by on the contrary part they cry out, that those colliar Phisitians can doe no good, but kill all men that put themselves into their hands with their venomous Medicines, so that they ought to be driven out of the Common-wealth, and that they are deceivers, and that their extractions, and preparations, their subtill and thinne spirits will profit nothing, and that the spirit of Vitrioll is poyson, the essence of Antimony and Mercury is nothing, the extraction of Sulphur is nothing worth, neither the liquor of Gold, and to be breif, that all things are contrary to the nature of man, and more to be avoided, then the eyes of a Basilisk: and yet they, in the mean time, like cunning and crafty Theeve[...], privily, and with fair promises, pick out from the poor Chymists the secrets of Physick, and secretly learn those things that they forbid the common people as poysons, afterwards challenging them for their own practises; and by this wicked injury they derive unto themselves the favour, freindship, praise, gifts, and rewards of men, which by good right are altogether due unto those, that by their labour, sweat, watching, and diligent search in naturall things, by Vulcans art have found out such things, and published them for the common commodity of man: and yet not contented therewith, they also publish great volumes filled with toyes, lies, and sophisticati|ons; going about, as much as in them is, to suppresse, overthrow, and utterly to extinguish the light with darknesse, and the truth with lies, and practise (the most plain and manifest workmistresse established even by truth it self) with a vain, feigned theorick, devised by their own subtill brain. I say to thee (thou notable Doctor, that so back-bitest Paracelsus) how canst thou by any means with thy trifling words deface the work it self, or with thy theorick refell the pra|ctise? Art thou so great a Doctor and knowest not, that thou hast profited so much, as by thy work thou canst bring ought to effect? Paracelsus teacheth, that the falling sicknesse is to be cured with the spirit of Vitrioll, and performed it, and the work it self declares it daily, prove thou the contrary, and cure the same disease with thy Pills, Sirrups, and Electuaries, then shalt thou have the victory. It"},{"pageNumber":266,"pageContent":"is not sufficient for thee, by bringing thy reasons, to prove, that metalline Medicines are not agreeing for mans nature, neither that metals may be so prepared that they may heal. Why? Thou deniest that which indeed is per|formed, and openly seen with eyes. It is a foul thing to be ignorant in that that every man knoweth, for out of all doubt you have all heard, that most dangerous diseases have been cured with metalline tinctures, yea, with such as have not been rightly prepared by counterfet Paracelsians, as with Vitrum Antimonii, which doth pluck up suddenly at once by the roots the impurities of the Fever, although not without great weakening of the powers, yet it healeth; and yet we allow not of such perillous cures: and so likewise of others. Now if the Minerals work this, not being rightly prepared, what think you will they doe being rightly pre|pared, and purged from their venome and poyson? And how can you with a safe conscience reject those things whereof you have no knowledge? It is not sufficient to affirm any thing, except it be confirmed by probable and grounded reasons: Every man will play the Ce[...]sor of Paracelsus, whom it is more easie to reprehend, then to follow: and whilest every man de|sireth to seem, or to be thought more learned then other, no man will learn of another. I say, every Paracelsian, which doth but onely carry coals unto the work, can shew you by eye three principles of Theophrastus Physick. Have you tasted the most sharp Salt, or the most sweet Oil, or the Balm, that most delicate li|quour? All those being hidden in every thing that is created, you have not once perceived. The metalline spirits, in whom Phisick doth consist, by no means can be found out, neither what force they have, or fellowship with mans nature, but onely by fire, for as fire did first shew, that the smoak of Mercury was poyson to mans nature without any subtill speculation, but thou diddest never handle coals, neither canst draw any so small a Balm out of the Vegetals; therefore being ignorant in metalline Physick, thou canst not so much as once guesse what it is, and therefore doest judge of things unknown, as the blind man doth of colours: Is it not a great folly to write against a thing, and not to understand it well before? Such as are addicted to Paracelsus doctrine, when they perceive you have no stronger weapons, then those you have hitherto gathered, they will conclude, that you rather confirm and establish Paracelsus Physick, then confute it: It is not enough to say a thing is false, except there be more probable and bet|ter shewed: Hereby it appeareth, that yee nourish a secret ignorance of naturall things in your selves. What, are you those great Phisitians and excellent Philosophers? How cometh it then to passe, that the force of drugs are hidden and unknown unto you? Doe you not in this point come neer unto the Empericks, whom you with great pride and brag of knowledge reject, when as you say, the Chymist, be he never so excellent, is no Phisitian, but he that with judgement and reason hath learned to make and use all remedies for diseases; for in those points consisteth the cheifest glory and commendation of a Phisitian, and the onely safety of the sick: How vain is this reasonable Phisitian, which prepareth his Medicines with reason and not with the hand? He is the very Phisitian that with his own hand purgeth his Medicines from their venome, and being so prepared, with sharp judgement doth apply them to their proper diseases, that the seed of the disease may be pulled up by the roots, and so must the speculation and practise, reason and the work concur and joyn together, because judgement without practise is barren. Tell me, how cometh it to passe that Mercury healeth the French Pox, and the filthy scab? Why doe you command the miserable sick persons to annoint themselves with Quick-silver, as Shepheards grease their Sheep? How happeneth it (I say) that Mercury is the speciall best remedy against these diseases? Doe you deny that metals doe any thing, yea, and the greatest part of these cures?"},{"pageNumber":267,"pageContent":"Why doe you command such as are infected with Leprosie to swallow Gold? Why doe you boil it in broths with Capons? Why doe you mingle leaf Gold in your Pills and Electuaries? You know that the force of the Leprosie is often delayed, that it breaketh not out into the upper part of the skin, by taking of crude Gold into the stomack: Then if Gold that is compact and not resolved doe work this effect, what will not the spirit of Gold work being loosed from his grosse substance. If you will not beleeve Paracelsus, that the cure of most dangerous diseases lieth hidden in metals, at the least, credit those that lived long before him; amongst whom Arnoldus de villa nova is cheif, who in his book of the preserva|tion of youth saith thus; Pearls dissolved into liquor comfort the naturall heat, help the trembling of the heart, and those that are fearfull, and properly they cla|rifie the bloud of the heart, and many diseases are cured by them: For it is a Salt of the Mine, which the wise call their Animall stone, and some the Minerall Chifir, and all the mastery in the preparation of it is, that it may be resolved into a most pure and notable water, with such things as doe not destroy his nature. This saith Arnoldus, who speaketh not of stamping, but of solution: but to what purpose doe I alleadge this? Verily, that you may see how with your own swords you cut your own throats, you use Pearles, Corals, and pretious Stones in your Electuaries and broaths, and those you beat into powder. You smell as it were a certain Medicinall vertue in precious Stones, but you deal as naughty Cooks & rude Country women doe, that when Partridges or Hares come to their hands, they thrust them into the pottage pot, or else seeth them in water: even so you stamp and break your Pearls, which should rather be dissolved. Albeit you should make powder as subtill as the air, you should nothing profit; for as you put it into the stomack, so shall you see it passe away again; and hereupon of very necessi|ty were the rules of Chymick preparations brought into Physick, which you doe hate worse then a Serpent or a Dog, with the practisers of them. What shall need many words? If you will not yet grant, that the speciall cure of diseases consisteth in Minerals, hearken what Andreas Matheolus saith in the fourth book of his Epistles; the bodies of the sick being full of seeds of diseases, will hardly be healed without metalline Medicines: and in his Treatise of An|timony, he saith, Antimony doth no lesse purge the diseases of the bodies, then Metals, from superfluities. This did that learned man understand, when as yet he knew not the true preparation of Antimony: Likewise he greatly esteem|eth the potable Gold, the preparation whereof, as the same Matheolus used it, I will declare unto you, because you shall not be ignorant. Take Gold twice or thrice purged with Antimony, make it into thinne plates, and in a fit vessell hang the plates that they touch not one another, and let it be burned and calcined in a Furnace duly prepared by the space of half a year with a very strong fire, untill at the length the plates being taken out and laid open in the air, they doe dissolve, and there flow from it a certain oily humour, red of colour, and of tast sweetish. He drew out two ounces of Oil of Gold, but out of that which was not so well burnt, the liquor did not so readily run out: Sometimes he used to poure on the spirit of Wine rectified, and that so long, and so much, untill the whole red co|lour was drawn out. You [...]hall rectifie those spirits, or essence of Wine, very subtilly, if you put it into a glass cucurbite under a limbeck with a Receiver, and set it in most cold or snowie water, and cover the head round about with a linnen cloth steeped in warm water, for then the subtiller parts will rise up, leaving the watery substance in the bottom. Gold calcined and often infused with the spirit of Wine with many imbibitions, and again distilled by a Limbeck, leaveth in the bottom behind a reddish liquour. That Phisitian used first to purge the"},{"pageNumber":268,"pageContent":"body, and then to shave and heat the crown of the head, and then to poure on a drachm of that Oil, and to give so much also to be drunk in Malmsey. The like is to be wrought with fine Silver for the diseases of the head, and so likewise of other Me|tals, for being duly prepared they doe dissolve, because they are Salts. This man hath many other minerall Medicines, which were never known, either to Galen, or to Hyppocrates, but brought to light by our Theophrastus Para|celsus, of whom you great Philosophers and Phisitians onely in name doe un|discreetly write. Doe you think all things utterly impossible unto other men-which you your self know not, or cannot doe, or that you cannot compasse with your divine knowledge? What will you say to this? I know a man, that within three, or at the most six daies, can heal the French Pox with his Turpetum mine|rale, not with that which is made with Oil of Vitrioll, but with another farre more excellent, which shall not come to your hands or knowledge, except you lay aside your frowardnesse, and cease to bring the Paracelsians in suspition with the common people and noble men, and to defraud them of the fruit of their just labours. You say, What have you brought to passe? what have you found out whereby you should look for praise or profit? Then doe we demand of you, What have you found out whereby Physick is the better furnished? We have brought into Physick, Essences, Oiles, Balms, and Salts, all which the Alchymists schools have found out. And how great light is come unto Physick onely by true distillation, it is known unto all men, and daily experience teacheth, how great commodity hath redounded thereby unto the sick. In the mean time, if you so much detest the labour, yet at the least spare our good name. But it is no marvell, doth it not so alwaies happen, that the best labour is worst accepted and recompenced? Every good man, inclined to vertue, wisdom, and fidelity, can witnesse the same, what reward they have often received for their fidelity and opening of the truth. So some men, when they can say no more, they object unto the searchers of nature their poverty, filling the eares of the common people with glorious lies, alwaies chanting upon those things which follow upon the abuse and dangerous cures of the counterfeit Paracelsians, judging all things by their contempt, poverty, vile estate, and basenesse, but they will quickly avoid that despi|sed poverty, which willingly they sustain, that the nature of things might daily more and more be known unto men, whereby the unaccustomed cures of most grievous diseases might at length be found out, with the which such as are diseased might through your sluggishnesse all die, if God, having compassion upon them now at the end of the world, had not provided wholsome Medicines, even by most contemned men. The Lepers, and Gouty, the infected with the Ptisick, Falling Sicknesse, and French Pox, devoured with the Canker, Fistula, and greedy Woolf, with the Dropsie, and Palsie, and that with the Plague, and other diseases, are thrust into their graves: these (I say) and many other more, whom you through ignorance, with your naughty and corrupt Potions and Pur|gatious, like Butchers have buried alive, will rise up against you: these (I say) will call you to answer, and accuse you, even the poor whom you have robbed of their goods, will require your bloud for the losse of their bodies, and consuming of their money. Then what a madnesse and cruell foolishnesse is this, that in the time of any great Plague, such as are infected you shut up in houses, set marks upon them, keep them in prison, strangle them with cares and solitarinesse, and kill them for hunger: Is the Plague so to be cured? Or whether, doe you not think that all men may be infected from whence the first man was infected? why doe you not preserve the whole with your Antidotes or Defensives, being so famous Phisitians as you are? but you have tried almost all your Medicines to be of no force in this disease. Doe you in this sort love your Neighbour as your self? or thus spend your life for your fellow, when as at no time (if help be"},{"pageNumber":269,"pageContent":"required) there is greater need of fellowship, company, comfort, and help, then in the time of Plague? O what great punishment have you deserved, that refuse those that are forsaken of their freinds, farre from their kindred, and as it were thrust into exile, whose solitarinesse hath been more violent unto them then the disease, and greif of mind hath killed rather then the sicknesse? What I pray you is true and Christian freindship? Doth not this complaint of the sick stir you up unto pitty? When I was in health, thou wert my freind, thou diddest visit me, and help me, but now that I am sick, thou doest abhor me, and liest from me; when fortune laughed upon me, thou diddest also laugh, but now that with greif and tears I crave comfort, thou doest deny it. What doe you call visiting and helping? You will not onely not help your selves, but will perswade Princes o[...] stop the passages, that no Travellers shall passe unto those places, when as you ought with courage to releive them of their greif, and willingly to goe thither to trie your cunning. But when any plague beginneth, you are the first that trem|ble, are afraid, and despair. The sick are committed unto you, as children and infants which lack diligent cure, you ought to help them, as the father doth his children, and not to rob them of their money; then would the sick man smile upon you, if you would refresh his languishing life with some gentle Balm, then would he rejoyce in the sight of you, and call you his father. Every naturall Phi|sitian of necessity ought to make his Medicines with his own hands, and not to commit them unto an unskilfull Cook, not to fill great volumes with receits, with the which I see those that are studious in Physick are in a manner over|whelmed, that they be ready almost to fall down and die under so heavy a bur|then of receits, Physick is not so learned but with the labour of the hands, pra|ctise being workmistresse, where Vulcan day by day doth shew new and pleasant remedies which nature teacheth the good steward her workman, daily to purge better and better from their superfluities. Doe you look for a rich harvest and doe not first plow nor sow? Look for knowledge of the secret naturall powers, and doe not first seek it out by labour with the fire? for the most part of you all are dainty and slothfull, and he that is slack in his works, goeth like a blind man unto his practise. If you did not so much abhor the Chymicall Art, you would learn to separate the pure from the impure (which is the cause of the corruption of things) by long digestions, distillations, and imbibitions, whereby you should make your Medicines pure and clean before you minister it to the sick; so upon the sudden receiving, the sick nature should be refreshed, whereas the weak stomack cannot concoct, digest, and separate grosse matters. But these great Doctors will not be Schollers, or young Souldiers, no more then an old Dog will be brought to hunting with whips, hee'l gnaw his line, and shew his grinning teeth to him that leadeth him, rather then he will be ruled; even so you will ra|ther openly gainsay the truth, and like Dogs bark and bite at it, then you will confesse your errours. What, ought this to be a reproach unto the Chymists, that for the true preparations of Medicines, whereof you are ignorant, and for their great labour and pain which you doe eschew, they should be accounted beggars, poor, and ragged? Doe you not think that the common people will at length find out your deceits? You have been sufficiently warned of many Doctors of Physick, who truly have not allowed your childish cures: Amongst whom, Conrade Gesner is one, and many other more, which if they were living, most certainly would deny your fained Art. Likewise John Woz of Cullen, which flourished 1510. doth sharply reprove the Phisitians of his time, who in his wri|tings upon the Plague, and labyrinth of Physitians, most plainly and excel|lently treateth of metalline Medicines, and Quintessences, and sheweth their use. What will you answer to those things which that Doctor Gorreus hath written, in the fifth book of the extraction of the Quintessence out of Hearbs, where in his Comments he so excellently extolleth metalline Medicines, and did use them, little esteeming your Medicines; for he saith, the distillations of"},{"pageNumber":270,"pageContent":"waters out of Hearbs, and other such like things, wherein the Apothecaries doe boast, are al|most of no force, for it is nothing else but the flegm of the thing, whose principall liquor consisteth in the oil of Salt. But that I may stir up in you an earnest desire to know the marvellous pro|perty of things, I will repeat unto you the judgement of Fernelius Ambianus in his second Book and eighteenth Chapter De Abditis rerum causis: When first (saith he) I gave my self unto the study of that sensible and metalline Philoso|phy, called Chymia, through long travell (as many other had) I getting a most perfect Master or Teacher, did draw out of every Plant, and other living things, very divers and sundry substances; first water, and that very plentifull, if the Plant were green, more scarce if it were dry; then Oil, but not that fat and fil|thy substance which by presse is drawn of our men, but the workmanship of a more excellent Art, which neither easily corrupteth nor soureth by age, and that of two sorts, one thin and white, another drier and red, &c. Then it followeth, I will tell you by your leave, not uttering this whole secret, but teaching you upon what true grounds it doth consist: But least the strange obscurity of the name might offend you, which the fathers have covered under a shadow or dark kind of speech, I will most plainly and openly shew it in his place: And yet you cannot away with them that give you good counsell, as also you will not suffer learned and excellent men, neither Gerard Dorne Doctor of Physick, whom no doubt God hath raised up unto us: This most excellent man is worthy of eternall memory, because that he by no injuries, neither perils, could be terrified, but that by his last Writings he hath made Paracelsus more famous, who doth excell with a most antient gravity and authority, that at the least he might help the children of learning, for whose defence, as a valiant Souldier, he contendeth by word and deed even to the death: the fellow and companion of that learned Phi|sitian Josephus Quirsitanus, famous in Physick, who hath excellently deserved for Physick, and in his books hath uttered many excellent philosophicall Secrets unto the posterity, and opened many hidden spagiricall Medicines, and would have brought to light greater things, if the ingratitude of some had not stopped his willing mind, and especially of a Perfumer, which goeth about to reprove many things, and to allow but few in his writing, and yet not able to shew better; whereby it comes to passe, that through one mans ingratitude all feel losse and lack. Proceed therefore with courage, drive away those drones and sluggish beasts from the rack, so shall your head be crowned with perpetuall praise. In the mean time, whatsoever we have gotten by many travels, and found out and learned with labour, we will here annex, praying our adversaries, that if they need them not, they will not condemn or slander them, or terrifie others, which with willing mind would imbrace these our labours, or else to teach them some better things; considering yet, that something in the mean time ought to be given and granted unto him, which for Physicks sake hath put himself in so many dangers. After the great murther and fury of our Countrymen the French men, when I went with D. Charles of Chambray, D. of Pansay into Italy, travelling through Istria, Ragusium, Sclavonia, Macedonia, and Bizantium, I incessantly applyed my whole study to understand and know some certainty touching the Philosophers stone, or Chymicall matters; but I could find no true Philosophers, onely false Phisitians and Chymists every where, which had either altogether none, or else very little knowledge of naturall Arts and preparations; at the length (by Gods good will) I happened upon a very learned man, Daniel Bishop of Dalmatia: Unto this most excellent man I directed my letters, the which, together with his answer, a little after sent to me, I will hereafter publish, wherein you shall see many philosophicall points, delectable to be read and understood."},{"pageNumber":271,"pageContent":"At the length, when I had sufficiently searched over the East Countries, and could gather no certain point in naturall Science, I determined to take my journey towards Germany, with the most courteous Prince Cabaneus Vydam of Chartres, still imploying my mind to the earnest study of Chymycall Physick; and there I understood, that Kings and Princes were deceived by unskilfull Pra|ctisers, which did utter and sell their sophisticate Chymicall Arts, which they had begged and scratched together out of all corners, with a pompous shew, decei|ving the Princes of their money; whereby it cometh to passe, that daily a great number of Sophisters, and sophisticators doe daily rise and spring up, through which, not onely the most commendable Art of Alchymy receiveth great detri|ment, is oppressed and adulterate, and the Chymists themselves made hatefull unto all men, consuming their life, time, and goods, upon vain works and practi|ses, but also there redoundeth most great hurt and damage unto the Common|wealth; for there are many deceivers so crafty, that with a dissembled experience in the Chymicall Art, and with fained freindship, and great promises, they doe craftily learn of others their cunning, which they challenge for their own, esteem of great value, and carry them about to be sold. As upon a time, certain knaves by craft got from me certain written books, and sold them for a great sum of money. Common-wealths and the Chymicall Art should be very well provided for, if that such knaves might be punished and restrained by the Magistrate, so should the studious of the Art be lesse deceived, and in short space the true and pure Art would appear from those shadows and sophistications. Wherefore, to the end that such as be desirous of the Art may have some pledge from me, where|with they may make this Science more plain, I will shortly (God willing) set forth three books of the Philosophers stone, written by divers Authours, whereof the first was drawn out of certain characters by a noble Brittain, wherein all the dark [...]peeches of the Philosophers are most plainly expounded, whereunto I will annex two hundred certain, infallible, and true philosophicall rules, whereby those that doe erre and doubt, touching the matter of the stone, shall be confirm|ed. The second book is, Johannes de Rovillasco Pedomontanus, which treateth of the Philosophers Mercury, and how it is drawn, together with an Epistle of John Pontanus of the same argument. But there is a more certain excellent Treatise of an uncertain Authour, which doth explain many doubts in that sacred Phy|sick. And because that all nations, especially the Germanes, have written books in their own language, I will also write two books in the French tongue, for the help of such as are studious of Philosophy, wherein I will treat of many prepa|rations and speciall Medicines tried by me and others, also of divers Elixars of the Philosophers, extractions of Mercuries and Mercuriall waters, of many and divers dissolutions, I will also add the interpretations of sundry Characters, wherewith the books both of the old and new Writers are written to cover and hide the Art; also the exposition of a certain Alphabet, without the which the work can hardly be understood: and two Treatises, the one of the vertues of the vegetall and minerall Oils, the other of the salts and properties of many vegetals and mine|rals; whereunto I will also joyn two Treatises of philosophicall Mines, and of making of Vinegers, the which my labour and study, if I see it acceptable unto those that are studious of that Art, I will shortly set forth greater things, which many with their whole hearts doe wish and desire; in the mean time, take in good part this little work. That which we have hitherto spoken, is spoken onely unto those that doe so deadly hate the Chymicall Physick, which think nothing can be well or profitably taught in Physick that the old Harp soundeth not; as though that nature were not more then Galen, or that all the learning of Physick were to be drawn from the Heathen, or that they alone had published the Art, and esta|blished it with such sound arguments. Why doe you not out of those Authours confute those"},{"pageNumber":272,"pageContent":"excellent men which are followers of Paracelsus, amongst whom, that great Doctor Petrus Severinus a Dane is cheif, who in his Idea hath opened the invin[...]ible foundation of Paracelsus Physick? Why doe you not answer to the monarchy of the Trinity, of that learned Doctor and Phisitian Gerard Dorne? Why doe you not confute the volumes of that famous Phisitian Turnesser, being confirmed with the truth of practise? But for your sakes, which daily call Galens doctrine unto examination, and with exact judgement doe consider of it, giving place unto Paracelsus, acknowledging and exercising his preparations and practise, I doe rejoyce, and shortly more shall come out against the adversaries, which shall bite them better; in the mean time, with your word, deed, and writing, defend the truth from injury. Farewell. B. G. B. G. Londrada a Portu Aquitanus, unto the gentle Reader health. THis Treatise of Paracelsus (friendly Reader) came unto my hands by the gift of a certaine noble Prince of Germany, and because it is sufficiently evi|dent to be Paracelsus work, I thought it not good to reserve it to my self, but to publish it abroad, seeing there cometh no commodity or profit of hidden Treasure: This therefore, such as it is (loving Reader) imbrace. But this one thing I would have you understand, that when you doe minister those exalted Essences of Paracelsus, and his pretious Oyles, think not that they are to be ministred by themselves, but with some other mixture to carry or lead them; and they must be used, the stomack first being purged with some speciall Medicine of Pa|racelsus? as for example, if you will minister Oil of Vitrioll, mingle five or six drops with an ounce of con|serve of Roses, so shall you safely give it, the like you must judge of other things; use these happily. Farewell. One hundred and fourteen Experiments and Cures, of Phillip Theophrastus Paracelsus, a great Philosopher, and a most excellent Doctor of the one and the other Physick, written with his own hand in the Germane tongue, which Conrade Steinberge his Servant found among other loose papers, and scrolles of Paracelsus.

For which cause the sayings of Philoso|phers are much and long to be searched, examined, and thought upon, before thou canst get out the hidden mean|ings of them. If thou in reading Philosophers Books play the Sluggard, then thou canst never bee perfect in preparing thy matters, and therefore I might not by the Authoritie of the laws of Philosophie, interpret all things openly, word for word to thee. Some things are to bee left for Industrious wits, wherein to exercise themselves by studying and searching. Notwithstanding, if thou bee not unthankfull, all these things shall be opened and de|clared unto thee in my Galliae portu, where very many workings hitherto known of few, shall faithfully be set forth. In the mean season, know thou, that I am not the deviser of these particular things, for some of them I had of gift, and some other for money and reward came to my hands. To thee I give them freely, which use well. Fare|well. 16 A Treatise of certaine Particulars, whereof the first treateth of the preparation of the Markasite of Lead, as well for the transmutation of Metals, as for the alte|ration of Mans body, &c. THe Philosophers Saturn, is properly the Markasite of lead, and indeed doth excell Sol and Luna, insomuch that Ray|mond saith, that in this inferior world, there is no greater secret then that which consisteth in the Markasite of Lead, insomuch that they which have throughly sought out the force and na|ture of it, have bound themselves together by oath never to utter those secrets of nature unto the end of their lives. For so much as his operation is of such kind, as truely it hath many and sundry uses, which being duely prepared, doth not onely alter and change the filthy and corrupt humours of our bodies, but also can change and transmute by sundry experiments, Luna into Sol. Take of the Minerall Markasite of Lead, xii. pound, and grind it into fine powder upon a Marble stone, as they grind colours with Vinegar: being well ground and tempered, put it into a strong glass, and put thereon a good quantity of distilled Vinegar, and stir it well with a stick, and so let it stand in Bal|neo Mariae: then set thereon a blind head, and there let it stand eight daies together, stirring and moving it every day six or seven times, then let it coole, and the Vinegar"},{"pageNumber":284,"pageContent":"will be of a yellowish colour, the which ye shall poure forth into ano|ther glasse, taking heed that ye stir not the feces: then put thereon more Vinegar, and stirr it well with a stick, and set on the blind head, and set it in Balneo Mariae other eight daies, as yee did afore, then poure forth the Vinegar being coloured into the other glasse. And this order ye shall use so long, untill you see the Vinegar no more coloured, for at the last the feces will remaine in a white masse, like white earth. 17 Distillation of the coloured Vinegar. THen take all that Vinegar being coloured, and distill it in Balneo untill it will drop no more, and there let thy cucur|bit stand three daies with the feces, that it may drie well, then take it forth, and thou shalt find in the bottome of the glasse a white matter, the which take out, for in that whitenesse the rednesse of the Markasite is hidden, which being prepared, availeth much to make Aquam Philosophorum, that they call ar|dentem. The preparation of the Feces. Take the white Feces or matter, and put it into a distilling vessell with a great recipient very well luted, that the spirits go not forth, and set it in the hot ashes, and give it a gentle fire, and then increase it according to art a day or two, and there will come forth, first a white water, and then a red or golden yellow oyle, the which is to be kept close with great care. The Feces to be taken againe. Then take those Feces, and set them in a calcining furnace eight daies: then take them forth and grind them finely, and put them in a glasse with a good quantity of distilled Vinegar, and stir them well together; that being done, set it againe in Balneo eight daies together, and stir it every day seven or eight times, the more the better, then let it wax cold and settle, and pour away the clear part from the Feces, but take heed that ye stir not the dreggs or bottome.

And this thou shalt do so often untill the salt leave no feces in the bottome: that being done, distill thy Vinegar as at the first, and thou shalt find it prepared, liquid, and clear as Christall. Conjunctio spiritus corporis, scilicet olei & salis.

Then take it forth, and grind it upon a stone, and according to the weight put thereunto as many Letones of the Calex of fine Gold, and upon all these put on asmuch of the white water which ye distilled before the red oyle, as all the whole doth weigh, and close it up with Hermes seal, and set it in ashes in an Athanor with a soft fire untill it be fixed, but after it be fixed, there will appear many colours, the which will turn into per|fect oyle and true Elixar.

That being done, distill it, that the feces may remain dry, then increase thy fire, that the sand and glasse may be red hot the space of three houres: then let it wax cold, and take out the matter, and beat it finely, and wash it with fair distilled water, untill it have lost his sharpnesse, and that thou shalt do divers times till it be well purged: then dry it, and put it into a glasse, and put thereunto the spirit of wine that it may be covered three fingers high, and set it on a fire, and thus thou shalt doe three times, and then hast thou without any doubt a greater secret to heal his proper disease, so that within six dayes he shall be quite whole: the dose is about five graines in conserve of Roses, drunk with wine or Saccaro Rosato, as|well in the morning, as at night when he goeth to bed, and let the patient sweat thereon two houres at each time. It is a most soveraigne medicine against all contractions, and you use it, as afore, according to the nature of the disease. But the Patient must use it six daies.

That being done, draw away the spirit in Bal|neo, until it remain thick like honey, unto the which ye shall put his oyle that ye distilled, mix them, and let them digest, untill it be so thick that ye may make thereof Pills, the which yee may do so soon as it feeleth the cold, for in the cold it will wax hard, and in heat it will waxe liquid; the Dose is from one scruple to two scruples, where there shall be need of pur|ging, put in the ponder of Licorice, for so it worketh without pain. Four principall Diseases whereunto almost all other Diseases may be referred. THe Leprosie is the first, whose badges all manner of Ul|cers doe bear, as Itch, scabs, Alopecia, scurffs, chops in the skin, foulnesse, the dead evill, and such like diseases. To the Gout doth belong the collick, pain in the reines, Orexes, pain in the teeth, running gouts, painfull flixes, pain of the head, Cephalea, and Hemicranea."},{"pageNumber":288,"pageContent":"To the dropsie are referred all manner of Fevers, Impo|sthumes, the Jaundies, and evill digestion. To the Falling Sicknesse belongeth Catharrs, beating of the heart, cramps, giddiness of the head, Apoplexies, and Suffoca|tion of the Matrix. If any of the princpall of these Diseases be healed, all the other inferiour be also cured. For the cure of the Gout three things are required, that is, resolving, mitigating, and strengthening. Wherefore, if thou be of any quick judgement, the four particulars before set down are sufficient for thee. The chiefest point of health consisteth in this, not to fill thy self with meat, nor to be slow in labour. 23 Bernardus G. Penotus Landrada à Portu S. Mariae Aquita|nus unto the singular learned man John Aquila, the ham|mer of the Ethnicks, wisheth much health. NOt onely in these our dayes (friend John) but also in the old time amongst the learned, this Proverb hath taken place, That Ignorance is the mother of marvelling: Who in these dayes would not marvell to see men utterly void of all man|ner of learning, to be preferred before learned men, and such as are most skillfull in the Latine and Greek tongues, and those are to be imbraced of Kings and Princes, and re|warded with most liberall gifts, and most famous and learn|ed men expert in all the tongues to be rejected and contem|ned? You, which excell in judgement and learning will an|swer, That every perfect gift cometh down from the Father of light. Therefore God doth in these latter daies stir up these Ideots and Empericks to stir up every Physitian, that he should rightly prepare his own Medicines with his own hands, and being so prepared, with sharp judgement apply them to their proper diseases, that the seed of the disease may be pulled up by the Roots, and not to commit it to an unskillfull cook. And therefore of necessity from hence must both the Theorick and the Practise, the reason and the work concur and joyn to|gether, because judgement without practice is barren. The greatest number of them will answer, we know not your works and preparations which require so great and hard la|labour, we are now old and Doctors, we will not bee made yonglings, and Schollers again. If this answer might take place, the Jew, the Pope and the Turk would not change their superstitions, which notwithstanding we know to be most contrary to the sacred Scripture. But we sufficiently and daily prove by calcining, subliming, dissolving, purifying, di|stilling, congealing and fixing, by this most laudable Art of Alchymie, how the pure may be separated from the im|pure, and the corruptible from the incorruptible, and that which is venemous and deadly, be changed and made whol|some 24 some and good; and as Paracelsus saith concerning this Art, we shall first consider that all things are created of God, for he created of nothing something, and that something is the seed of all things, and that seed worketh that effect here|unto ordained and"},{"pageNumber":289,"pageContent":"appointed. All things notwithstanding are so created, that they shall come unto our hands, and be|gin to be in our power, but so as things not perfect, but to be made perfect, as things not finished, but to be finished. The matter in them truly is perfect, but the middle and last matters remain to de made perfect. As for example, God created Iron, Earth, and Clay, but not such as they should bee, for the clay groweth, yet not like a Pot or other earthen Vessel: So he created Iron lying in a rude Masse, and hath gi|ven it so rude unto us, therefore we with our labour must make thereof shoos for horses, sythes, and spears. Even so is it in Physick, for that is also created of God, but not so that it should be utterly perfect, but as yet hidden under the earth, not purged from his unclean matter, but that which remaineth to be made perfect in it, is committed to the Chy|mist, that is, to the Physitian to be purged and cleansed. For herbs, trees, stones, and iron, and whatsoever is seen with the eyes is no true Medicine, but is rude and impure, where|in as yet the pure part lyeth hid. And therefore Alchymy teacheth to purge the Medicine, to dissolve it, and to sepa|rate things of contrary kinde from things of the same kinde, otherwise rotten things would be mingled with rotten, and the corrupt with the corrupt, and so conspire to one effect; so that of one disease many other should spring or arise. Briefly, every man loveth not that whereof he hath no un|derstanding or knowledge, but flieth from it, contemneth it, and thinketh it not meet to be learned. The body onely, careth for that which is outward, but the mind worshippeth his God. By how much more the knowledge or understand|ing of any thing doth increase or grow, so much the more is the love of the same augmented. For all things consist in the true nkowledge of them, and out of that springs all the good fruits that redound to knowledge. Knowledge also brings faith, for he that knoweth God, beginneth straightway 25 to put his trust in him. For such as every mans faith is, such is also his knowledge. And contrariwise, he that doth otherwise work about nature, worketh like a Painter that painteth an Image, in the which is neither life nor strength, wherefore those which you call Empericks shall rise even before your faces, and take in hand and help grievous diseases, the cures whereof are unpossi|ble unto you, and you together with your consultations and reasonings shall be made laughing stocks. As lately B. in Germanie it happened of a certain noble and famous woman which was vexed with the pain of the Matrix. Some Physi|tians said it was the gravell and the stone, but an Emperick passing by, affirmed that it was neither the gravell nor the Stone, wherefore he commanded a Remedy to be prepared for the Matrix, the which being done, she was straightwayes healed. Oh what a rumour was raised by and by of him, stirring up others also to rumours and tales, saying, that her husband doth contemn us, that will rather use the advice and counsell of an Emperick then ours. Yea, and others that seemed wiser did finally regard him that would every hour use the help of an Emperick man most unlearned. Mark, I pray you (my friend Aquilla) how the enemies inflamed with envie go about to oppresse the truth: But at the last, will they, nill they, they shall be inforced to confesse that that cannot be denied. But you may object unto me, He that speaketh all, excludeth nothing. For there be many worthy learned men, Masters and Professors of Physick, that do not deny or refuse this Art. In the which number are those most excellent and singular Masters, and Doctors, Petrus Se|verinus Danus which hath written marvellous things of this Chymicall Art, that worthy and godly man Michael Neander, Professor of humanitie, Theodorus Zuingerus of Basil, a man practised in this Art, and also Theodorus Brickmannus a Phy|sitian of Cullen, which both by word and deed daily excel|leth with most deep judgement in these matters, whom I will never overpasse with silence."},{"pageNumber":290,"pageContent":" 26 Hereafter followeth three Particular Treatises, the first of the Sulphur of Gold, and other Metals, then of Stones, and the Extraction of Corall.

Rejoyce, and give praise unto Jesus Christ. A Fragment out of the Theoricks of John Isacacus Hollandus. AMongst all things that were created of God, water was the first, whereunto God joyned his proper earth, and of earth, whatsoever hath essence or life, hath his originall. Therefore there are two manifest elements, that is, Water, and Earth; in which the two other lye hid, the Fire in the Earth, and the Aire in the Water: and they are so knit together, that they cannot be separated. Two of them are fixed, as the Earth and Fire, two are flying, as Water and Aire. Therefore every element doth participate within other elements. More|over, 28 over, in every element are two other elements, one decaying, Putrifying and combustible, the other eternall and incorrupti|ble, as the heaven: besides, in these natures lieth hid another nature which is called by the name of stinking Pheces, which hinder and take away the strength of the rest, so as they have very little force or none, and thereby make the other elements stinking and subject to putrefaction. There is also two kinds of Waters, the one elementall, the other of rain and river|waters; as there is also two kinds of Earths, one elementall, clear, shining, and white, the other black, stinking, and com|bustible. Like as also there be two Fires, one elementall and naturall, the other stinking and combustible; the like is also to be said of the aire. The base things are so mingled with the rest, that by and by they corrupt all things, so that nothing can continue long, for they bring death, and weaken all nature be it never so noble. This is to be understood of all things both vegetall, animall, and minerall. Therefore it is necessary by Art to separate the elementall nature from the corruptible, that the matter may be brought to a medicinall qualitie. There be three most subtle spirits in all things, that is, colour, taste, and smell, these fly away invisibly, the Philosophers call them wild spirits, because they are not fixible, yet the industry of the Artificer may fix them. They alwaies grow in the bodily substance untill they come to perfection and end. The hearb therefore is to be taken when it is fully grown, and take heed that you loose none of those three spirits, as the ignorant use to do with their putrifactions and separations of elements. For none of those spirits consisteth of the three elementall elements: but God hath adorned elements with those three spirits, and of them the Fire is animall, the Water, aire ele|mentall, and no man, but God can separate them asunder. But the water of the clouds may be separated from them. Also all the feces may be separated from them which are mingled with them, which are the stinking and corurptible elements, and the four elementall elements may be brought to a christa|line shining: but these three elements, Fire, Aire, and Earth, are unseparable. My son, know this, that Mercurie is the first of all things, for before time there was water, And the spirit of the 29 Lord rested upon the water, but what was that water; the water of the Clouds, or a moisture which might be poured out? No, but it was a dry dustie water, and God hath joyned his earth unto it which is his sulphur, and so the earth congealeth the water, and thereof sprung the four elements included in these two, by the will of God. Therefore Mercurie congeal|eth sulphur, and sulphur"},{"pageNumber":292,"pageContent":"Mercurie; neither can one of these be without the other, as also they cannot be without their salt, which is the chiefest meanes, by whose help nature ingende|reth and bringeth forth all vegetals, minerals, and animals. Wherefore these three, Mercury, Salt, and Sulphur, cannot be one without another, for where the one is found, there the other are found also, neither is there any thing in nature where|in these three are not found: and of these three, whatsoever is in nature hath his originall, and are so mingled with the four elements, that they make one body, and the salt is drowned in the bottome of the elements, for it is necessary that the salt should keep them united by his sharpnesse and drinesse, notwithstanding it is a flying spirit, but because it sticketh in the bottome of the mixture, and is overcome of the fatnesse and combustible oyle, in which it is found: as the yolk within the white of the egg, and the combustible oyle liveth of earth with the salt and feces, and the salt is buried in the bottome of the feces of the combustible oyle and earth, but by great force of fire. These three spirits whereof we have spoken, are said first to be separated from the mixture of the elements, which is the soul of all things, or their Quintessence, which houldeth together the whole mixture of the elements; for when the spirits are gone out, then the mixture is dissolved by it self and divided, neither is there need of fire to expell the salt from the earth; when the elements are separated from the feces, then is the salt also separated with it. This salt is unknown to the ignorant. Therefore salt is the meanes be|tween the grosse earthly parts, and the three flying spirits rest|ing in the naturall heat, that is, the taste, moist smell, and co|lour: which three are the life, soule, and quintessence of every thing, neither can these three spirits be one without the other, as the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost are one, yet three 30 persons, and one is not without the other. The ignorant laugh, neither understand they these three spirits, when as they are tied to the grosse, earthly fixed parts, and are made subtile, and their salt is joyned and mingled with them, it must transform them altogether, and fix them into a Cristaline body, Diaphanes, and red of colour, whereof we will speak hereafter; he that knoweth not this salt, shall never bring any to passe in Art. The Philosophers call this salt a dry water, and a lively salt, but the ignorant thought they meant Mercurie, but the Philosophers called the three spirits Mercurie, and the earth Sulphur, which the ignorant understand not. Either of them cannot be without the other, neither is there any thing in nature, in which these three are not, and they are so mixed with the four elements, that they make one body and mixture. Whatsoever God hath created is in these three stones, where|fore all may be reduced into a Cristalline clearnesse by Art, given by God unto the Philosophers, for in the latter daies God will separate all the unclean feces and corruption that is in the elements, and bring them to a Cristaline clearnesse, and rednesse of a Carbuncle. Afterward there shall be no more corruption, but they shall endure for ever. Do you think that all things, which God hath created in these lower parts, should utterly perish in the latter day? No, not the least haire of those things which God hath created, no more then the incorruptible Heaven, but God by his Will will change all things, and make them Cristalline, and the four elements shall be perfect, simple, and fixed in themselves, and they shall be all a quintessence. Demonstration of these things may be made here upon earth by Art, for whatsoever God hath crea|ted may be brought to a Cristalline clearnesse, and the ele|ments gathered together into a simple fixed substance, which being done, no man can alter them, neither the fire it self burn or change them, but they shall continue perpetually as those things which have attained eternitie. 31"},{"pageNumber":293,"pageContent":"The Order to draw forth the Quintessence of Sugar, collected out of the Vegetable and Animall Works of Isaac Hollander. HEre will I shew thee a great Secret, how thou shalt draw forth the Quintessence of Sugar, the which truly excel|leth all Vegitable works, by means of his temperature like unto the incorruptible heaven, the which is neither hot, cold, nor dry, but most temperate, neverthelesse compounded of the four Elements, but they strive not one with another, for they are so joyned together, that they can never be sepa|rated one from another, but for ever remain simple and fixt in unitie. But this heaven doth distribute and give unto the earth whatsoever is necessary for it, although that it self be neither hot nor cold, moist nor dry, the which like Effects hath the Quintessence of Sugar, the which in it self hath the four Elements, as gold hath: as gold is pure, so Sugar is im|pure, gold outwardly is hot and moist, inwardly cold and drie, and white: sugar is the contrary, for it is outwardly cold and dry, and inwardly hot and moist and red, and fixed both outward and inward. Neither is there any thing want|ing, but that the inward qualitie may be brought, that his red|ness may appear outwardly, and that his Feces be separa|ted, then is it prepared, and shall not need to be fixed, for it is fixed already, and doth retain within it self all outward and inward spirits, and whatsoever is Volatile it doth retain. Now what his kinde is I will tell thee, and from whence he hath his Originall, that is, even out of the red, but if thou wilt be further satisfied, read the three and thirty chap|ter of the generation of those things that grow in the Seas, and other waters, where we write largely of the nature thereof. Here it shall be sufficient for us to shew the or|der how to prepare it, and in what order it should be used in Medicine, and also to other things where it may be ap|plyed. His nature is to retain or hold all flying spirits, and to fix them into a stone, as shall be shewed hereafter. First ye shall understand that ye cannot separate the Fe|ces, except ye bring the inward parts outward, that is to say, 32 that his inward dark golden colour do appear, the vvhich when it is so distilled, his rednesse is seen, and this fire, pas|sing the yellownesse of his aire, or his incombustible oyle, then mayest thou first separate the Fesses from the Quintes|scence. Take therefore hard and white Sugar, for it is not needfull that ye travell much in dissolving and congealing of it, although there be much impuritie therein, that hindreth not, but that the inward part may be brought forth, for it must be purged when as the redness doth shew it self out|ward. Take therefore ten or twentie pounds of Sugar more or lesse as you shall thinke good, that being beaten, put it into a cucurbite of hard stone, and put thereon Aqua|vitae, that it may stand covered eight fingers, then distill it in Balneo with a strong fire, untill it will distill no more, then let it wax cold, and pour on the said Aqua vitae again, and distill it again, and this shalt thou doe six or seven times; At the last open the head and take forth the Su|gar, which thou shalt put in a strong glasse, and set it in fine sifted ashes, and put thereon the Aqua vitae, and distill it untill the half be come forth, then pour on again the A|qua vitae which thou distilledst away, first being made warm lest the glasse should break; Yee shall note, that the head would have a hole in the top, by the which you may pour in the Aqua vitae with a Funnell, this thou shalt repeat of|ten with a strong fire, that the wine and the Sugar may boil in, and because the half part of the wine will come away quickly, ye shall presently put on the other part, for if yee should distill forth all the wine, the Sugar would burn through too much heat, because it must continually be boyling in the glasse, and it would smell of the burning, for it hath al|waies his combustible Sulphur, wherefore ye must alwayes have half the wine in the Vessell, and when thou seest the half is distilled forth,"},{"pageNumber":294,"pageContent":"make the same warm, and put it in again with a Funnell, and that thou shalt so often repeat, untill the Sugar remain as red as blood, the which thou shalt perceive through the glasse. Thou mayest bring that to passe in eight or ten daies according as thou rulest thy fire. Note, that when thou perceivest the matter to be red, let 33 it cool, and take away the vessell with ashes, and set the ves|sell in Balneo, and with a strong fire distill away the Aqua vitae untill the Sugar remain dry, and when it will distill no more, yet thou shalt let it stand four or five dayes very hot in the said Balneo, that the Sugar may be perfectly congeal|ed, then let it cool, and take out the matter or stone, the which will be like black Pitch, that is to be understood when it is congealed, then take the said stone, and put it into a great quantity of common water twice distilled, and set it in Balneo five or six dayes with a great heat slightly covered, stirring it every day five or six times with a wooden ladle, then let it cool, and take it forth, and let it settle three or four dayes, then pour of that which is clear into another vessell, and keep it close, then pour on those Feces the sublimed wa|ter as before, and set it in Balneo to digest three dayes, stir|ring it with a ladle as yee did afore, then let it cool and set|tle, and pour of the clearest part, as yee did afore, and put it to the rest, then pour on more water upon the Fesses, and digest it in Balneo as afore, and this you must so often repeat untill the water be no more coloured, then thou mayest cast away the Fesses, for they are nothing worth, for the Element of the earth is with the Element of fire and water, neither can they be separated any more, but are fixed together. Make thereof a triall, for there will remain nothing but light ashes; It will burn like oyle or fat, neither doth there any thing remain more then of oile or fat. Take the glasse wherein is all the red of the Solution, and distill it in Balneo, or let it vapour away, if yee have store of distilled water, untill it be dry, then let it cool, and take off the head, and pour thereon more sublimed water, and set it in Balneo again, and stir it about with a wood|den ladle as yee did afore, then let it settle as afore, and pour out of the clearest part, and that thou shalt doe so long, till there be no more Feces, then put it in a glasse that may abide the fire, and boyl or vapour it away so long, till there appear a certain scum on it, then take it forth, and set it in a cold and drie, or hot and dry place, and it will grow into a great red masse or lump, and transparent like a Rubie, or other Philosophers stone, which if thou wilt bring to pouder, set it in a warm dunghil in a large 34 wide glasse open, and let it vapour away, untill it be come into a yellow pouder like unto gold, and so thou shalt have the Quintessence of Sugar fixt, the which will retain all flying spirits. Neither is it sweet, but a heavenly taste, the which, if yee put it in your mouth, it will melt without any feeling. If it be winter or cold, thou shalt seem to feel a certain natural heat throughout the whole bodie, and shalt seem so temperate and light, as though thou couldst flie. If thou be over-hot, swallow a little, and presently thou shalt cool easily, as though thou wentest into a cold bath, and thus it worketh in heat, moist, cold, and dry, by an incredible Miracle: When yee will use it, drinke it with rectified Aqua vitae, or Rose-water, En|dive or Scabios, or by it self if ye will, and thou shalt see marvels: If any be diseased outwardly with Scabs or Ulcers, let him drinke of this, and wash the sores with Wine, wherein this Quintessence is dissolved, and he shall presently wax whole most mraculously. If any be wounded or thrust in with any weapon, so that it be not deadly, let him drinke {dram} i. of this Es|sence with warmed Wine, and wash the Wound with Wine, wherein the Quintessence is dissolved, he shall be presently cured, so that those which shall hear or see it shall be ama|zed thereat. It helpeth also the falling sicknesse, pestilence, and all such diseases as may happen unto man; if yee have Aurum potabile, yee shall mix lb ii. with lb i. of this Quintes|sence in a glasse, and set it on a Trivet, or in a dry Balneo 30 dayes in an Athanor, and they will be fixt together, and then it will work miracles in mans bodie; ye may also"},{"pageNumber":295,"pageContent":"when you have drawn the Quintessence of any hearb, coagulate and fix it with the same, as I said before with Aurum Potabile, and thou shalt see thereof Miracles.

NOw will I open unto you a great Secret in the Vegetall work of honie, to wit, a marvellous nature, for it is drawn out of the most noble and pure part of the floures. The na|ture of Bees is such, that they draw out the best of every thing, as in the Animall work is more at large described, wherein there is taught how to extract the nature of all beasts, and speciallly in the 84. Chapter. Wherefore (my son) know this, that all that God hath created good in the upper part of the world, are perfect and uncorruptible, as the heaven: but whatsoever in these lower parts, whether it be in beasts, fishes, and all manner of sensible creatures, hearbs or plants, it is indued with a double nature, that is to say, perfect, and unperfect; the perfect nature is called the Quintessence, the unperfect the Peces or dreggs, on the venemous or combu|stible oile. Therefore you shall separate the dregs and com|bustible oyle, and then that which remaineth is perfect, and is called the Quintessence, which will endure continually, even as the heaven, neither can it be dissolved with fire or any other thing. For when God had created all things, and looked upon them, they were all perfect good, there was no|thing lacking to any; and therefore for loves sake I say un|to thee, that God hath put a secret nature or influence in eve|ry creature, and that to every nature of one sort or kind he hath given one common influence, and to every one of se|verall kinds their severall influence and vertue, whether it bee on Physick, or other secret works, which partly are found out by naturall workmanship. And yet more things are un|known then are apparant to our senses: What! doe you not think that an hearb that is appointed for one disease, which it will cure, doth not contain in it many more vertues then are known unto us? Yes truly many more. This also I adde, that if the Feces and combustible oyle be taken away from this thing or hearb, which in all things is the poison that should be taken away, that brings death unto us, and the 36 Elements should be purified, and so burned together by Art, that they shall passe together by a Limbeck, and be joyned together, as it were coupled in marriage, that it may root out all manner of disease from every thing, be it hearb or living thing, or be drawn from his venome, as in the 14. Chapter of the Prologue of this Book is declared, and also in the Prologue of the Animall work, whereas the manner of draw|ing the Quintessence out of all venemous beasts, birds, worms, and flies, is plainly declared, that it may help all the griefs of man, but that specially is drawn out of the bloud of man, and there is likewise declared, that there is no need of things without man or beast to help such as are infected. For eve|ry creature contains in himselfe the remedy of his disease, which remedie may be drawn without the hurt of man or beast, that the"},{"pageNumber":296,"pageContent":"disease may be miraculously cured, as is there most excellently taught in the Theorick and in the Practick. There|fore I would write this, that thou soon mightest understand what marvellous force is in Honey, which is taken out of all floures, and gathered into one Masse, which truly is indued with sundry Vertues. For if God hath given unto other things the gift of healing, what then is there not in Honey, which is gathered out of so many floures, and every hearb indued with his own proper Vertue? Truly if it be brought to his height and excellencie, it will work marvellously. Now consider what lieth hidden in this Quintessence, and esteem it not lightly, but keep it secret as the most excellent thing of all the Animal work, the which being obtained, you shall need no other Medicines to put away all the accidents of the bodie. CHAP. II. NOw I will set in hand with the practise. Take twelve quarts of the best Virgin Honey, and put it in a great earthen Vessel with a Limbeck well luted, and set it in Bal|neo, and lute a Recipient to the neck of it, and distill that which will distill of it in your Balneo boyling. My son, know this, that there is no common water in Honey, but onely 37 Philosophicall and Elementall, for the element of Aire doth first passe with the element of fire, in the which the aire is con|tained, and the aire when it riseth, resembleth the savour of Aqua vitae distilled, and at the first can not be known from Aqua vitae, neither by sight, neither by savour: distill it untill there will no more arise, then leave the vessell in Balneo five daies with a Limbeck and receiver, let it boyl night and day, that the matter may be dried, then let it cool, and take it out, and take away the receiver and Limbeck, and that which is in the receiver pour into the vessel again upon the dry matter, and set it in Balneo, and cover the mouth of the vessel with a clean dish well luted, and let your Balneum be onely luke warm. My son, understand that it may thus be done, for it is good that the fire be drawn with his proper aire, so as a man would stay so long, for it would be of the greater force. The ancient Philosophers wrought in this sort, but the danger is, when the vessels shall be opened least the water fly away, for it is as sub|till as wine. For every time the aire is to be drawn away, and againe to be poured on, making putrifaction in a warm Balneo, but first it must be well luted, and a Limbeck being set on with a receiver, you must reiterate the work, untill the fire rise like unto red bloud. There is another methode or rule of work|ing found out in these our daies, which is in this sort. CHAP. III. THey are thus drawn out, and the matter dried, as is afore|said, then take common water, twice distilled in Balneo, and pour on as much as is sufficient, and set it in Balneo, cover the mouth of the vessell: but let not the Balneum boyle, and so let it stand three daies and three nights, moving it day and night with a spattle of wood: let it coole, and be poured out and strained. Then take a clean vessell and pour out that which is clear, and pour upon the feces fresh distilled water, as you did before, and set the vessell in Balneo, and do as you did before: let it be cleared and put aside with the first water, and put on againe fresh water distilled, and set it in Balneo as 38"},{"pageNumber":297,"pageContent":"aforesaid, and do this so often untill the water be no more coloured, for then have you the fire separated from the earth, but reserve the earth or feces untill I tell you further what you shall do with it, for there is yet a combustible oyle in it. CHAP. IIII. TAke the vessel wherein is the coloured water, and set it in Balneo with a Limbeck, and receiver well luted, and distill all the water with a boyling Balneo, and let the matter be well dried and coole, then take away the Alimbeck, and let the ves|sell remaine in Balneo, and pour on the water again upon the matter, and make a fire, and set a dish upon the mouth of the vessell, and let it stand so in Balneo three daies, every day mo|ving it with a spattle of wood three or four times, then let it coole, and be taken out and be strained. Then take a clean vessel, and softly pour out that which is clear into it, and up|on the feces straightwaies pour on fresh distilled water, stir|ring it about with a woodden ladle, and let it stand to clear one day, and the feces which remain put unto the first feces. Then take a vessell, and set it in a boyling Balmeo untill it be dry, and reiterate this work untill there remaine no feces in the bottome of the vessell, so shall you have the pure element of Fire: and the element of the Aire also must be so often distilled, untill there remain nothing in the bottome: and in this sort you shall have the pure Element. Separate then the water from the fire, and let it dry, so shall you have a clear shi|ning matter like to Camphore: keep the fire well in a glasse, and the aire with the water in another glasse well closed, untill you have your earth prepared. CHAP. V. TAke all the earth with the feces, and draw out the combusti|ble oyle by a discensorie, that is, with two vessels joyned to|gether and luted, untill the combustible oyle do passe, which is profitable for all cold diseases, and other passions, which were too long to rehearse: if you desire not the combustible oyle, 39 suffer it to fly away. Then take your earth, and calcine it in a furnace of reverberation gently, untill it be all white as snow, then take a great earthen or stone vessell, and put your white calcined earth into it, and pour out a good quantity of com|mon water distilled, and stir it with a wooden ladle, and set it three daies in a boyling bath, and cover it with a dish, and stir it every day ten or twelve times. Let it coole, and the vessell take out, and let it clear one whole day: then take another clean vessel, and softly pour out that which is clear, and upon the feces pour againe fresh distilled water, and set it in Balneo, and do as you did before. Take it out againe, and let it clear one day and night, and that which is uppermost clear, pour out to the first water: Then put to fresh distilled water the third time unto the Feces, and set it in Balneo, and do as you did before, and pour out the clear the third time unto the first wa|ter, then cast away the Feces of the third water, for they are of no value. Then take the vessell into which the water was put, and set it in Balneo, with a Limbeck and a receiver: and with a boyling Balneo, draw out the water untill the matter be made dry. Let it coole, take away the Limbick,"},{"pageNumber":298,"pageContent":"and pour in the water againe upon the Earth, or salt, and set it one day in boyling Balneo. Let it dissolve, and clear, and take out that which is clear; and put in a little distilled water upon the Feces, and let it stand two or three hours in a warm bath: take it out, let it clear by the space of one hour or two, and pour out the upper part to the first water, and cast away the Feces, for there is nothing in them. Let the vessel be set againe in Balneo with the earth or salt, and distill away the wa|ter untill all be dry, and do as afore, reiterating the work, un|till that no Feces remain in the bottom, then drein away the the water from the earth, and you shall find a faire earth like Cristal: and so you shall have pure elements. CHAP. VI. TAke a great glasse that will bear the fire, and put into it your earth and your fire, and pour your aire upon it, and set it to distill in a furnace, in pot or with sand or ashes, with a Limbeck well luted, having a hole in the uppermost knottie 40 part, that a Funnell may be put in when there shall bee need of Infusion: when as the humiditie that it hath received be half consumed, then fortifie your fire by little and little in|creasing it, untill you see the water boyl, and keep the fire in that state still, untill it be consumed even to a pint. Take away the fire, let it cool, take away your Receiver, and open the hole of the Limbeck, and put in your glasse Funnell, and pour in all the distilled water in the Recipient upon the Earth, and stop the hole of the Limbeck, and set the Recei|ver unto the neck thereof well luted, and distill again, and observe the manner aforesaid of drawing and making infu|sion, and do thus ten times. The tenth Distillation finish|ed, let all passe together; for then the earth is made flying. So the aire, the water, the fire, and the earth will ascend together by the Limbeck, and be brought into one substance which were in four. One together in nature, and now simple as the incorruptible heaven, yet are they not fixed: but notwithstanding they are so coupled together between themselves, that by no means they can be separated, but will continue one simple bodie for ever; even as the Christal|line and uncorruptible heaven, which notwithstanding is com|pounded of the four Elements. What thinke you of this my Son? Cannot this Quintessence help every disease that doth infect man through his most excellent temperature, whether it be in heat, cold, moist, or drie, for all are in it that he may distribute unto every one that which is necessary, even as the heaven, when need requireth, giveth unto the earth all things, as coldnesse, heat, or moisture: And yet it is neither hot, cold, moist, nor drie, but of one simple essence, and that in|dued with such a nature, that it giveth unto every thing that which is necessary: In like manner doth this Quintes|sence. Therefore my Son rejoyce, and give the Almightie God thanks which hath opened these things unto the Phi|losophers. CHAP. VII. NOw my Son, if thou wilt bring this Quintessence yet to a greater perfection: Take a great Circulatory, or Pelli|can, 41 that is, a glasse that hath a great head like to a Limbeck, and in the"},{"pageNumber":299,"pageContent":"top of the head a hole, by the which the matter may be poured in by a Funnell; let the hole be stopped; out of the head cometh forth two armes bending round unto the belly, by the which that which doth ascend up may fall down again by those armes of glasse into the belly of the Pellican: This is the form of the Vessels that distill one into another, or Pellican. 1. Take then your Quintessence, and put it in a Pellican in ashes, but better in salt prepared and dried, and make your fire like unto the extream heat in Summer, and the Quintessence will rise like unto a red Oil, and fall down again by the armes of the Pellican; and by often ascension, the Quintessence will wax thick, that it will tarry in the bottom and rise no more; then fortifie the fire that it may ascend and descend again; then keep the fire in that heat untill it ascend no more, but rest in the bottom; then make your fire stronger, that it may ascend and descend again, and keep the heat in the same degree untill it rise no more. 2. Observe this manner in augmenting your fire untill the water be fixed, and the glasse be red hot four and twenty houres together; if the Quintessence doe not then ascend, it is fixed, and brought unto his highest vertue; and take it out of the glass, being yet hot, for if it be cold, it will wax hard, so that you must break the glasse; for at the fire it doth wax liquid, and being set open in the air, it doth congeal, and peirceth every hard thing, as Oil doth any dry leather, and in colour is like unto a Rubie, and through shining like a Christall, it giveth light in the dark, sufficient to read by. What doest thou think of this my Son? are there not many strange bodies created of God? Truly he hath in|dued the Philosophers with no lesse gifts; for they that can look into the secrets of nature, shall see it to be of an incre|dible operation, for this is gathered by the Bees of the sub|tilest part of all Plants, Trees, Floures, and Fruits, and at that time, when Floures break out and Trees bud. It is worthily called the Philosophers stone, for it is fixed and liquable as Wax, and as the minerall stone transmuteth the impure metall, so doth this alter diseases. Hereby it doth appear, that this doth bear the bell amongst all vegetals; whereas it being yet 42 in his grosenesse and impute, it is but of small value for any use in Physick, by what means so ever it be boiled or scummed, but doth alwayes retain his nature; for it consisteth of all the fruits of the earth, plants, and trees: Whereof one hearb is hot, ano|ther cold, another dry, another moist, one astringent, another laxative, some corrosive, others venomous; and so divers hearbs have their divers qualities. 3. It cometh to passe, if it help one disease, by and by it hindereth another; for every thing worketh according to his property, when as there is se|paration made in the body; and of this separation it ingen|dereth bloud and other humours: And they are likened unto Gunpowder, which so long as it lieth still there cometh no hurt of it, but if it be brought unto the fire, it strait uttereth his secret nature, and is kindled with a venomous fire, which cannot be quenched with water; for the cold and dry, hot and moist, doe strive amongst themselves, a wind is stirred up, that breaketh all things that is near unto it. The like happen|eth unto Honey, that when it cometh to the region of the Li|ver, that it should be there separated, then it sheweth his nature to passe up, and swell with wind, that it is no marvell, if that through contention the veins of the Liver be broken, as often|times it happeneth, whereupon Imposthumes are caused in divers places, and bringeth forth such inflammations, that the veines are easily broken; although many doe greatly com|mend Honey, but they are not the children of Philosophy, neither doe they understand the nature of it: But when it is brought to a simple, fixed as Wine, then is it the cheifest Me|dicine amongst all the vegetables, neither is the like unto this found in all the world. Give God thanks, and be liberall unto the poor. The dose of this is one grain, and it must be taken every morning with an empty stomack, likewise in the evening, untill the end of the disease. For every disease will be cured in short time, even after the same manner, as the Minerall stone maketh his projection upon metals: Praise God, and labour diligently."},{"pageNumber":300,"pageContent":" 43 The manner and order how to draw the Quintessence out of the Hearb, called Rose solis. NOw my Son, I will teach thee the greatest mystery or secret amongst all vegetable things, whose force and strength hath been kept secret amongst all the antient work|men, and they have bound themselves one to another by Oath, that they should not utter, in their books or writings, the strength of this Hearb, which is called Rose solis, and in the Germane tongue Sindawe. Whosoever therefore hath not the whole vegetable work, he cannot attain to the strength of this Hearb; for in that work is comprehended all the force of medicinall things: And this work of vegetables is not come to the hands, but onely of the antient sworn Artificers, which were skilfull in the liberall Arts. But now my Son, I will open it unto thee with adjuration, that thou shalt keep this hidden knowledge secret. First, my Son, you must under|stand, that this Hearb is the Hearb of the Sun, upon the which the Sun spreads his beames and influences, as he doth upon Gold in the veines of the Mines; and he poureth out his in|fluences more upon this Hearb, then upon any other which is created of God, as it is evidently known of the antient Phi|losophers, and this Hearb doth so farre surmount all other Hearbs which spring out of the earth, as the Sun doth all o|ther Planets in the Heaven, and hath greater force and power of influence then any other thing created of God in the Firmament. So this hearb doth excell all others in vertue, and therefore this hearb is decked with another colour, other leaves, and stranger shape then all other hearbs. And his nature is such, that the hotter and drier the country is in the time of the year, and the heat of the Sun, and the more that the Sun doth heat and burn him, this hearb is the more moist and filled with dew, insomuch, that upon one branch will hang above a thousand drops. Make a triall, and strike this hearb with a slender twig, that the drops which fall from it may fall into a large glasse vessell, and you shall see the vessell filled with a marvellous dew, and if the Sun be vehement hot, those 44 branches in short space, that is, within the space of half an hour will be more full of dew then before, and if you strike the dew twentie times with a rod, yet it will again bee laden with drops; it were enough if wee did see no other miracle then from whence this dewie humour should rise, which in so short space doth so abundantly flow from it, and how much the more the burning sun doth scorch up the other hearbs, so much the more is this moist, and filled with drops, even as though it had been sprinkled over with water, hereupon may we gather his marvellous qualities, and judge that there is some secret operation hidden in it; if thou do keep this wa|ter thus gathered in a glasse, therewith thou shalt cure all the diseases of the eyes, whether they come of Rheums, or of In|flammation: It helpeth moreover all the pains and diseases of the heart, it cooleth the Liver, and stomack that is infla|med, and doth mitigate all the pain of the head that cometh of heat, and driveth away all dreams and Phantasies: It is good also to kill the Canker and the Wolf, against the biting of Venemous beasts, against Poison drunke, if it be taken by the mouth, it helpeth also the Pestilence, it is good for many other diseases which were too long here to rehearse. This hearb hath the colour of the sun, for his colour is red dark, divided with yellow lines, and his shape is like a Star, and his proportion like a heavenly Planet, and consist|eth of seven"},{"pageNumber":301,"pageContent":"branches, in the outward part broad, neer the ground narrow, and it is as though it were heavie, of a ten|der substance, outwardly hot and moist, inwardly cold and dry. The left side of it is cold and moist, the right side hot and dry, and it is most temperate as gold. Wherefore his Elements cannot be separated one from another as in other hearbs, but it may be purged from his Feces, for his fixing letteth that the Elements cannot be separated, for the fire will ascend with the aire by the Balneum, as we will hereaf|ter teach. The earth may be separated from his Feces, and the Feces likewise from the fire and aire, although it hath not many dregs. Some Latine Writers call it Lingua avis, or Birds-tongue; some call it Solaria of the Sun, of Lunaria it is called the Moon; the Fleming calls it Sindow. But the old 45 Philosophers have kept secret the qualities as yet for the mar|vellous effect it worketh. And it is marvell, saith Arnoldus de Villa nova that a man should die that eateth every day some of it in his grosse substance, what will it then work when it is brought unto his finenesse, and cleansed from his Feces? It hath this great vertue in it, that if it be put into a glasse, wherein there is poison mingled with wine, or any other cup that is poisoned, straightwayes the glasse will flie in Pieces, but if it be a stone pot of Alabaster, or such like, the Wine will so boil, as though there were a violent fire under it, and all the wine will run out untill there be nothing left in the ves|sel: Also if any man carrie this hearb about him, and hap|pen on his enemies, they shall have no power to hurt, but contrariwise to shew him all kind of dutie. Also if any man bee bewitched either in bodie, or in his art, that is in Cook|erie, Brewing, or Baking, or by any other meanes, this hearb carried about him makes him free from the witchcraft. If it be also tyed upon the belly of a woman with child, she shall straightwayes be delivered, although the childe were dead and rotten within, as it hath been oftentimes proved by experience. This hearb carried about one, or a little there|of every day eaten as long as it is used, preserveth a man from the Falling Sicknesse. Moreover, if a man be taken with the Apoplexie, that his mouth be drawn aside, and his speech and senses taken from him, they shall be all restored again, if the sick drinke the juyce of this hearb streined, as hath been of|tentimes proved. Moreover if it be hanged about the neck of one that is possessed of a spirit, so long as he carrieth that about him, he shall be quiet as a Lamb, and the power of the spirit shall be taken away. Make a proof, and you shall find it true. The bleeding at the nose is by and by stayed, if you hold that hearb in your mouth. They that are wearied with travell, if they drink the juyce thereof in wine, they are by and by so refreshed, as if they had not laboured or gone no journey, it doth comfort the Sinews, Muscles, Tendons, and all the whole nature. Wounds are also cured therewith, if it be drunk ten daies together in Wine or Ale, if the wound be washed with the same drinke, and bound up with a cloth wet in the 46 same. The pain of the teeth, is by and by appeased, if that hearb be laid unto it. All these things have been often pro|ved and found true. If it will doe such things whilest it is yet hindred with his grosse matter, what will it work when it is brought to his perfection? My Son, know this for a truth that there is no hearb that grows upon the earth to be com|pared unto this in strength and goodnesse, therefore take heed that you doe not neglect it, but diligently remember and keep the secret close from them that are not of the na|ture of our children, and from the ignorant. For if this hearb did not grow so plentifully, and the properties there|of were known, it would be more esteemed then gold or precious stones, for the Effects of the Quintessence are mar|vellous, as hereafter shall appear. Now there remaineth that we must teach how to bring this hearb to his highest degree, and to his Quintessence. First, it is to be gathered, the same having his course in his own house, that is in the Lion, and the Moon behold him with a sinister quadrate Aspect. It is to be gathered whole, with roots, leaves and floures, so that there be neither earth, dirt, nor other hearbs mingled"},{"pageNumber":302,"pageContent":"withall. Neither must it by amy means touch any water or be made moist. Therefore you must take heed that you gather it not in rainie weather, or moist weather: but rather when the Sun doth shine hot|test upon it, gather great store of it, and stamp it well in a morter of Marble, and put it in a Cucurbite of stone with a head and receiver luted, and set it in Balneo, and distil away all the water, untill it be so dry like pouder, and there will rise together with the water of the colour of most fine gold, which onely happeneth in this hearb, and in none other, and when there remaineth no more liquor, yet leave the cucur|bite for three or four dayes in Balneo, and boil it night and day that all the moisture may be perfectly separated and drawn away, then let it cool, and take away the receiver, and stop it diligently, then take off the head, and take out the matter and beat it in a Marble morter into most fine powder that it may passe through a thick sieve, put this pou|der again into an earthen cucurbite, and pour on your water 47 and aire, and stir it with a woodden ladle, and cover the mouth of the cucurbite close with a tile, and set it in a warm bath by the space of nine dayes to putrifie, every day stir|ring it with a wodden ladle four or five times, and cover the cucurbite again with a tile, setting a weight of lead upon it, at the nine dayes end take your vessel out of the Balneo, and that which is in it, strein it into an earthen vessell glased, and strein it hard untill the matter drie. Then take this dry pouder, and put it into his cucurbite, and cover it with a tile, and keep it in a warm place untill I teach you what you shall doe with it. 1. The moist liquor which is drawn from it will be red, for the Element of fire is there present with the air and the wa|ter, put that liquor into a cucurbite of stone, and put on a head, and lute it well, and set it in Balneo with a Receiver well luted, and distill away all the water, with the air severally from the fire in a boyling bath, until there will no more distil, and the fire will passe away in the bottome, then take away the vessel out of the bath and stop it well untill I teach thee what is further to be done. 2. Then take again the stone cucurbite wherein your pouder is contained, which I bad you before to keep, and pour on the fire and the aire, and stir it well with a wooden ladle, and set it in a warm bath nine dayes more, and cover it with a tile, and stir it four or five times every day with a ladle as you did afore. And when the nine daies are past, strein out that which is in the Vessel, and pour the liquor into a glased vessel, the residue of the pouder put into another vessel, as you did before, and keep it so long untill I teach thee how to draw out the combustible oyle. 3. Then take again the Vessel wherein your fire is, and mingle your liquor with it which you keep in your glased ves|sel, where your fire and aire is, and set a head upon the ves|sel where your matter is, and lute it, and set it in Balneo, and set a receiver to the bill of the head, then distill out the wa|ter and air with a boyling bath until no more will distill, and you shall have in the receiver water and aire, take them away, and take the Vessel out of Balneo, and you shall find remain|ing in the bottome like thick Turpentine, and that is the Ele|ment 48 of fire mingled with many Feces. Now the fire is to be separated from the Feces in this manner, pour on your wa|ter and aire upon that from whence you draw it, and stir it with a spoon, and cover it with a tile, and let it settle four dayes, and the Feces will fall into the bottome, and pour out softly that that is clear into a clean cucurbite, that no Feces passe; withall stop the Vessel wherein the Feces are, and set it by. But that Vessel that containeth the water fire, and aire, set it in Balneo with a head and receiver fitted and well luted, and distill the water and aire in that same degree. And when it will distill no more, take away the receiver: Let the vessel cool, and you shall find in the bottome"},{"pageNumber":303,"pageContent":"your fire, which keep in his vessel well stopped, and pour in your water and aire again upon the Feces, from whence you did draw them, and stir them with a spoon, and let it settle four dayes, then pour it out softly from his Feces into the vessell that hold|eth your fire, so that no Feces be mingled withall, cover your vessell wherein your Feces remain, and set it up. But your Vessel, wherein your water, air, and fire, is set again in Balneo as I shewed you, and distill away the water and aire, for they two doe alwaies passe away together, and the fire remaineth in the bottome. Pour on the water and air again upon the Feces, and stir it with a spoon, then let it settle four dayes, (this is now the third repetition, whereby you have separated the water and aire from the Feces,) and that which is clear pour out into the Vessel that holdeth your fire. Then put your Feces unto the first which I bad you keep, in the which your combustible oyle is. For now you have drawn your fire out of your Feces: therefore distill your water with the air, and when it will distill no more, take away your Vessell, and you shall finde in the bottome the Element of fire not yet pure, but foul and full of dregs, pour on therefore the water and air again, and stir it well with a spoon or la|dle, cover it, and let it stand, and settle four dayes, then pour out that which is clear into another clean vessel, and set aside the Vessel wherein your Feces are. But the Vessel wherein your fire, water, and oyle are, set it in Balneo to distill as long as it will distil, then take it out, and pour the liquor di|stilled 49 into the vessell where your feces are, and doe as I taught you to work with the feces, untill you have your element of fire without any feculent or grosse substance. When you have distilled away the water and air from the fire, and suffered it to settle four dayes, and that all be clear without any feces, then shall you have your pure fire. Therefore put all your feces together unto your first feces, where your combustbile oyle is. Afterward take a great Cucurbite of glasse, and put all your three Elements into it, and set it in ashes with a Limbeck and a Receiver fitted and luted, and kindle a gentle fire, first in your furnace, and increase it more and more, untill the fire and air be passed, and that your Limbeck begin to wax red within. Then make the heat of your fire moderate, untill all your element of fire be passed, and the head red like bloud, and the water and air shall swim upon it like oyle: by this meanes these three Elements shall be brought to their highest essence, and be perfectly rectified. Take away the Receiver, and stop it diligently, untill your earth be prepared, and know, that in the dust and feces there remaineth yet a combustible oyle, which you may extract by a discensory, if you will. It is good against the cold Gout, for Members benom|med, and Sinews too much mollified. If thou be weary of this labour, put this powder or feces into a reverberatory, that they may be mingled with a gentle fire, untill it be as white as snow; which being done, put it into a large cucurbite of stone, and pour on a great quantity of water twice distilled, it is not materiall how much water you pour on, and stir it well with a woodden ladle or spoon five or six times, alwayes cover it diligently with a tile, and after four dayes suffer it to cool, and let it stand four dayes and settle, then pour out the cleer from the feces warily into another clean vessell, and pour on fresh distilled water as before, stir it with your spoon, and keep it two dayes in Balneo as before, then suffer it to cool and settle, and pour out the clear from the feces, and put it to the first water; doe this the third time, and then cast away the feces, for they are good for nothing: All your waters that you have drawn, distill by Balneo, or, for the more speed, by ashes, that all the water may rise, and that there remain in the bottome a dusty matter, pour on distilled water again, stir it, and keep it in Balneo by the space of four and twenty houres, 50 then let it cool and settle, and pour out that which is clear gently from the feces: Poure on again more common water upon them, and stir it, set it in Balneo ten or twelve houres, take it out, let it settle, and poure the"},{"pageNumber":304,"pageContent":"clear unto the first water, and cast away the feces, they are nothing worth. Repeat this work so often, untill there remain no feces after it hath setled. Then shall you have your earth rectified from all his feces, which you shall congeal and dry, that it may be like powder or dust: Then joyn that with your other elements in the glasse, and it will straight resolve into his element, for the element of water is there present: set them all together in a furnace upon ashes, put on a Head with a Receiver well luted; the head must have a hole in the top, that with a fun|nell the liquour may be poured in, and alwayes stopped safely. Make your fire in your furnace first gentle, afterward greater, untill that, that is fermented, doe passe; but all is not to be drawn out, but about half a sextary of the liquour with the water, that the matter may remain moist; for if you should drive out all, it would con|geale into an hard masse, and break the glasse in the furnace. Then open the hole which is in the top of the Head, and with a funnell poure in that which is in the Receiver; but first it must be made warm, least by pouring in the cold liquour the glasse doe break, but if you suffer the glasse to cool, you may poure it in without any danger. Repeat this inbibition ten or twelve times, afterward distill out whatsoever will be distilled, so long as any thing will passe by the neck of the Limbeck: For after this tenth distilla|tion, the earth will be no more congealed, but will rest in the bottome like a red golden Oil. Inbibe it again, pouring on the liquour, and distilling it untill all the elements passe together by the Limbeck, and that nothing at all doe remain in the bottome of the vessell. Then give thanks to God for his marvellous gifts, which he hath distributed unto his Philosophers, and hath given them so great knowledge of things as they uttered in this work, which is altogether heavenly, and rather divine then humane: For it is a great marvell in this life, that mans understanding can bring these inferiour things to so great perfection that they have attained, even to the highest degree of vertue. Truly it is the work of the Holy Ghost, which hath put it into the mindes of men. For I doe affirm, that whosoever hath this hearb so prepared, that he 51 may help all the infirmities of mans body, whether they be curable or uncurable, except naturall death, which is ordained before unto every man of God. Yea, this I dare be bold to say, that if a man doe use daily the weight of one scruple of this Quintessence, or the Quintessence of Sugar, and potable Gold, wherein Pearles are dissolved, or the Quintessence of Selan|dine, that man by Gods help shall not die before the day of the great judgement; for the humours in mans body can by no meanes predominate one over another, as in the thirty six Chapter of Vegetals is taught, where is treated of the Quint|essence of all Medicinall things, and there it is shewed, that by Gods help the life of man may be prolonged even untill that day, void and free from all diseases and sicknesse. And fur|ther, that man may be preserved in the state he was in at thirty yeares of age, and in the same strength and force of wit; and upon that doe all the Philosophers agree, that a man may con|tinue in the same state as long as in an earthly Paradise. This is so plainly and at large shewed in that Chapter, that will you, nill you, you shall be inforced to conceive it in your mind to beleeve it, and to confesse it to be true: Therefore it is not needfull to reason much of the force and qualities of this Quintessence, but whatsoever disease a man be infected withall, give him to drink with Wine so much of this Quintessence as a nutshell will hold, and in short space he shall be healed, as it were miraculously, according as the disease is, violent or gen|tle.

IT is an old and true saying of the Poet, that there is nothing more imperious than an ignorant man, which thinketh no|thing well done, but that he doth himself, which thing, as it may be seen in many other Arts, ye[...] most especially in this, which is called the Spagyrick Art. For we see every where cer|tain men, I know not what they be, puffed up with a certain barbarous and foolish pride, which with great scorne inveigh against those Medicines which are drawn out of the metalline Mines: which notwithstanding it is apparent were in use, and had in great estimation with the cheif antient Phisitians, as we have declared in that book, which we have set forth of the Spagyrick preparation of Medicines. And what, I pray you, is the cause of this anger, or rather madnesse, but that (as they themselves confesse) they know not the preparation of them? O happy Arts, if onely Artificers might judge of them, as Fa|bius is reported sometimes to have said: Then are they un|happy, of whom the ignorant and unlearned fear not so rash|ly to give judgement, which never yet understood from whence, or why, this is called the Spagyrick Art, which learned men of two greek words have so named; because by that Art a certain subtill and spirituall nature is drawn, gathered, and pressed out, wherein the force and effect of the Medicine doth cheifly con|sist; the great and incomparable commodity whereof, as it appeareth in many other diseases, so shall it cheifly be known in curing wounds by gun-shot: As I trust (God willing) it shall much more happily be tried and found out, by the pre|parations of Medicines animall, vegetable, and minerall, and by other Essences drawn out of Mercury, Sulphur, Vitriol, Arsenick, Iron, Copper, Lead, and Litarge, and also out of Antimony, and such other minerals, as also out of the grosse and fat bodies of simple metals, of whom it is farre off, that the force should be so great (although the antient Phisitians have used them to cure Wounds and Ulcers, as their Writings 53 doe testifie) as the force of their spirits, which may be called, as it were, their soules. But peradventure some of those back|biters will say, why are not we content with those Medicines and Remedies, which the learned Antiquity hath delivered unto us, and that Hyppocrates and Gallen, the antient Pillars of our Art, and others, have set forth in their Monuments? why seek we new wayes never heard of before, especially unknown to the Apothecaries? But some of us will answer, that the onely remedy of Mercury precipitate, is the onely remedy (to passe over other) which very lately they have begun to use in curing of Wounds by gun-shot, and other maligne Ulcers, were sufficient to answer this their question, yea, and to reprove their folly joyned with intollerable pride. But if authority be asked for, I think Gesner, Guinter, Andernack, Severine, (to passe over a great many other) will be for us of great authority with the learned, as these slanderers; especially, because the learn|ing of these famous men is confirmed by their learned Wri|tings and Monuments, that those tongues might count it a great honour unto them, to confesse themselves their Schol|lers. It were easie for me to bring forth many other argu|ments, if I did not see the folly of these back-biters to be so great, whereof"},{"pageNumber":306,"pageContent":"truly I am ashamed, especially when I behold some of their books lately set forth, wherein, contrary to the purpose of the Treatise, strange things are inforced, that (as the old Proverb saith) the ointment seemeth to consist in nothing, as though they pertain to the purposed treating of curing the Gout, certain invective digressions I know not what of the beginning of things, of the originall of metals and Philosophers stone (which of them is called Morosophocus) or did in any point seem to agree with it. Therefore again and again I am inforced to cry out, O happy Arts, if onely Artificers might judge of them. How farre unlike was the purpose of many old men, the which if they were ignorant of any thing, which they understood was known of others, even in farre distant Countries, they spared no labour to goe see them. Plato inflamed with desire to learn those things which he knew not, went into Aegypt, and after to Tarentum, to Ar|chitas, and over all Italy, to hear the other Pythagorical Phi|losophers: 54 Apollonius Tyanius travelled through the king|dome of Persia, and passed over the Mountain Caucasus, and visited the Albanes, Scythians, Massagets, and all the rich king|domes of India; afterwards was carried unto the Brachmanes, and heard Jarehas in his chaire of gold disputing of the hidden causes of things, and of the hidden mysteries of nature; from thence by the Elamites, Babylonians, Chaldees, Medes, Assiri|ans, Arabians, and Palestines, he returned to Alexandria, and from thence went into Ethiopia to hear the Gymnosophists, and to learn their secret and hidden Arts. This vertue is truly to be followed, and not the sluggishnesse of those slouthful fol|lowers, which having scarce once moved their foot from their country fires, yet will disallow this Spagerick Art, and think no further labour to be taken in searching of the truth, when notwithstanding, that Art doth make open unto us the mar|vellous and hidden secrets of nature; neither in my judge|ment are they unworthily contemned of those, which with their manifold perils and travels have sought out those secrets of nature. But, I pray you, what foolishnesse is this, to forbid us to use any other Medicines, then those which were known in old time? As though Rhabarbe, then which no Medicine is more in use this day, then were known to the old Phisitians: Further, to what purpose is it, that they object unto us the Sul|phury metalline venomous stinks (as they call them) by whose smell and drawn breath (for these are their contumelious words) they be almost strangled that come into the dens of those Cyclops? But is it unknown unto those slanderers and Sycophants, that the old Phisitians made very many Medicines of most filthy things, as of the filth of the eares, sweat of the body, of womens menstrues (and that which is horrible to be spoken) of the dung of man and other beasts, Spittle, Urine, Flies, Mice, the ashes of an Owles head, the hoves of Goats and Asses, the Wormes of a rotten tree, and the scurfe of Mules, as may be gathered out of the Writings of Galen, Aëtius, Aegineta, Dioscor. Marcel. Plin. Serap. to passe the metallines, which it is evident they did also use. Truly, when I consider with my self the pride of these fooles, which disdain this me|talline part of Physick, which after their manner contume|liously 55 they call Chymericam, and therefore can neither help their own, nor many other diseases. I call to minde a Sto|rie, peradventure known unto them of Herachto Ephesio, which being sick of a dropsie, despising the help of Physitians, an|nointing himself over with cow-dung, set himself in the Sun to drie, and falling asleep was torn in pieces of dogs: but these are more then sufficiently answered unto these fools and slanderers. Now I will declare what is my purpose and scope in the Treatise; verily to prescribe plainly hereafter, not those things which are already common, or (as it is commonly said) known to blind men and Barbers, lest I might seem to imitate those that use to write Rhapsodias, and heaps, but the method and way of preparing Medicines by Spagerick art, that pertain unto Gunshot, which I know are yet unknown unto many Physitians and Chirurgians. And this I can truly confesse, that"},{"pageNumber":307,"pageContent":"I am induced for two causes to doe it: First, to provoke those that are better learned, if they have any better Medi|cines to utter them, as also that I might specially help my countrie and mankinde: unto the which (the more is the grief) there is too much need of those kinde of Medicines in these most lamentable and cruell times, wherein it hath so long been bloudded with domestical and civil wars; but to incounter with their slanders which cry out, that these kind of Medicines doe not onely require long and difficile pre|paration, but also that they are so dear that every one can|not easily use them. I have thought good therefore first to set down common Medicines, and then to come to those which I doe far more esteem, as indeed they are far more excellent then the other, as by their preparation you may know. Albeit also I have determined to have conside|ration of the poor and common Souldier, and to set down them apart that shall help the rich.

There be made other Remedies for the aforesaid intents, the making whereof we have described in their proper pla|ces, which I commit to the judgement of the skillfull Chirur|gians to use wisely, as the disease and partie affected doth require. Now there remaineth to speak of drinks for wounds, before we teach the preparations of Medicines. 61 De potionibus vulnerariis. These potions for Wounds, although they drive not out the humours downwards, yet prevail they very much to cleanse Wounds, because they cleanse superfluous humours, and the blood from all filth, and by a certain marvellous quality where|with they excel, they knit the broken bones, and help the si|news that are hurt by Wounds, and helping nature, they at the last fill the Wound with flesh, and close them up without using any other remedy: when as I saw in Germany, the mar|vellous and almost incredible effect which came by the use of these potions, even in curing desperate Ulcers, I thought it not meet to passe over the mention of them, and that so much the rather, because I knew the [...]se of them in time past was al|lowed, but now, through the negligence of Phisitians: to be almost grown out of use. Also I have experienced those poti|ons to be taken, not onely as Medicines, but also as nourish|ments, and to help all the passions and incommodities where|unto Wounds are subject. The Simples whereof the Medicines are made, are these: Cyclaminus, Consolida major, Consolida media, quam Sophiam nonnulli vocant, Sabina, Galanga, Vinca pervinca, Centaurum, Ophioglosson, Betonica, Aristolochia, Veronica, Agrimonia, Verbena, Serpentaria, Persicaria, Arthemisia, Lilium convallium, Zedoaria, Pyrola, Sperma ceti, Cancri fluviatiles, Nux vomica, Astaci, Mumia, Macis, Bolus Armena. You shall much better draw out the strength of those sim|ples then the common sort, if you put them into a tun of white Must, and digest them there two moneths, or if you cut the green hearbs very small, and wring out the juyce of them into a Pellican or blind Limbeck, or circulate them three or four dayes in Balneo Mariae. This last way is most convenient for them that are forbidden the use of Wine, especially if they be wounded in the head. The distilled waters of them be also good, if they be taken dryly by themselves morning and e|vening, with dose and manner convenient: Or if white Wine be delayed with them (if it be granted to the wounded.)

This Christaline salt if you put it into a glasse, and set it in a Wine cellar or other moist place, within few dayes it will resolve into a clear oyle, very excellent to cleanse the spots and ulcers of the face.

Then distill all in a strong fire by a Retort, and there will come forth a hot oyle, the commodities whereof can scarcely be declared. After the same manner if you will, you may distill all the 66 salt of Tartar by a Limbeck, whereof you shall make a most excellent and wholsome oile. Vinegar being distilled by a Limbeck, the Feces remain in the bottome of the Vessell, which first dried, afterward with a violent fire, if they be driven out by a Retort, there cometh forth a very red and sharp oyle. Then if you doe again dis|solve the dead head or Feces in warm water, filter, and coa|gulate it, the salt of Vinegar will rest, in the bottome, the which is very profitable for all eating Ulcers. Soot brought into fine pouder, dissolve it in distilled Vi|negar in Balneo, and separating all the mensture, that which remaineth in the bottome dissolve and coagulate again, so long till it come"},{"pageNumber":319,"pageContent":"to white Salt, which in a moist place will dis|solve into oyle, very apt to cure the Gangraena and all ma|lign ulcers. Bole Armoniack made into fine pouder, dissolve it in the sour flegm of Allum, then separate the flegm by Balneum and pour on other. Doe this three times, and then the Bole will be turned into a very fat oyle, which with a very soft fire is dryed, and brought into pouder most apt to stanch bloud, wheresoever it breake out. Take of Cloves beaten in pouder one pound, simple water, or Aqua vitae, which is better, six pound, infuse them to digest in Balneo or dung four dayes, then put them in a Limbeck with his Refrigatorie, distill it according to art, and separate the oyle from the water by a funnell, and keep it for your use. After the same manner shall you draw the oyles of Sage, Ju|niper, Amber, Turpentine, Myrrh, Frankincense, Sarcocolla, Mastick and Euphorbium. We have written another better way to draw oyles out of the foresaid things in the Spagyrick preparation of Medicines. Wheat being put into a Retort with the spirit of wine, di|gest it eight daies, then distill it with a violent fire, that which is distilled pour again upon the dead head, digest it again, and distil it again, if you reiterate this three times, there will come forth a most excellent oyle for Gangrena and Carcinomata. Take of the flowers of Hypericon small cut two pound, oyle of Turpentine i. pound, yolks of Eggs, 20. Aqua vitae half a 67 pound, mingle them all together, and let it putrifie in hot dung one whole moneth, then wring it out, and set in the Sun two moneths. After the same manner is the Balm of Visci pemorum made, or with oile Olive, first purified in Balneo. Take of the floures of Hypericon, one pound, of the Mu|cilage of the root of the great Cumferie, four ounces, floures of Camomil, Verbascum, ana, p. ii. Oyle of Eggs and Turpentine, ana lb ss.

Take of the leaves of the Misselto of the Appletree cut small two pound, put them into a Vessel of glasse, putting thereto Buds of the Poplar tree half a pound, oyle of the grease of a Badger, and of Butter, ana four ounces, Turpentine vi. ounces, oyle of Worms two pound and a half, good white wine two pound, digest all well stopped in very hot dung two moneths, then presse it and circulate it, and with a soft fire boil it untill the liquors be consumed, there cannot be found a more excellent Medicine to asswage aches and pains. The juyce of the leaves and roots of hearbs you shall puri|fie untill it be clear, pouring to it so much Aqua vitae, and di|gest it in Balneo in a glasse 15. dayes, then separate that wa|ter by distillation, and there remaineth in the bottome the slime or muslage of the hearbs."},{"pageNumber":320,"pageContent":"Steep the leaves and roots of hearbs in common water filtred, or that which is better, in white wine eight dayes, then let them boyl three dayes with a soft fire under them. Then wring them out and purifie it, then boyle them with a soft fire, untill they come to the thickness of honie, which we call the slime of Mucilage. By this rule you shall draw out of both Comferies, Cynoglosso, Centaurie, Vinca pervinca, Aristolochie, the root of Henbane, and the middle Bark of Tilia their Mucilage very profitable for the foresaid Medicines. Out of the floures of red Poppie or their juice you shall draw a water by a Limbeck very profitable to cool. 68 The salt of mans Urine hath an excellent quality to cleanse; It is made thus, First, the Urine is to be filtered, then coagula|ted, after with distilled Vinegar dissolved, and again coagula|ted, these must be reiterated three or four times. Melt Wax at the fire, and boil it with Wine till it be con|sumed, doe it so long untill it crack no more; take lb . i. of Wax thus prepared, Allum calcined lb . ss. Sage leaves M. i. put all into a Limbeck with his Receiver, and distill it with a mean fire: First there will come forth a grosse oyle, thick, hard, and white, which must be distilled again as before, and three times reiterated, and so you shall make an excellent oyle of Wax for all greifs of the sinews: In like manner is the oyle of Rosin and pitch made. Out of Honey you shall first draw an excellent water by Balneu[...], afterward you shall put unto the dead head, or feces that are left, sand or flint stones calcined, that the matter boile not up, which you shall drive out by a Retort of glasse, giving fire by degrees, and so you shall distill a yellowish clear oyle, together with a grosse impure oyle; let all digest again four or five dayes, after distill it again by a Limbeck in sand, and there will come out a pure red oyle swimming upon the water; this water is sour, almost like Vinegar distilled, and is very good against the Gangrena; but the oyle which burneth like Aqua vitae hath marvellous qualities, especially if it be circulated cer|tain dayes with the spirit of Wine; for the spirit being after se|parated, there remaineth a sweet oyle of pleasant savour, good for Wounds by gun-shot, and eating Ulcers. Out of the feces which remaines is drawn a Salt, first being calcined with a fire of reverberation, dissolving it with his proper menstrua, or common water distilled, filtering and coa|gulating it three times: It is good for all rotten Ulcers. This Salt you shall mingle with his proper burning Oil according to art, and you shall reap greater commodity thereof then is lawfull to be spoken. Take of Honey not separated from his Wax lb . ii.

Take Butter first molten in white Wine, and then distill it with a mean fire, and there will distill out an oyle greatly swaging paines and supplying: So shall you make oyle of Larde and all greases."},{"pageNumber":321,"pageContent":"Take a hundred yolks of Eggs first sodden hard, put them into a Cucurbite, and make fire by degrees, first there will come out a water, after a yellowish oyle swimming upon the water, last a thick oyle: The water is good for all spots in the face, the oyle to appease all griefs and aches. Boile Creveses in water of Orpine in a double vessell well stopped one whole day; after distill it, pouring the water three times upon the feces, then let it be kept, it is very good for in|flammations, burnings, and the Carcynomata. The sperme or seed of Frogs is gathered in the moneth of March, and is distilled by a glasse Limbek, and thereof is drawn a water very commodious for inflammations and burnings. Eggshels, or the shells of Snailes, are reverberated in a sharp fire three dayes, untill they be brought into a very white Calce; but if they be sprinkled with Vinegar whilest they are calcined, the Calce will be the lighter, and apter to work his force. Mercury first washed and prepared, according to Gebers prescription, dissolve with the double weight of common Strong-water, then distill it four times, and pour it so often again upon the feces, and so it is brought into a very red pow|der, out of the which, being reverberate at the fire, and drawn away, the spirits of the Strong-water, which otherwise would move great pain; but it were better, if it were washed with the flegm of Allum and Vinegar distilled, and the water of Eggs, for by that meanes the sharpnesse is taken away. But it is better to prepare Mercury with often sublimations, and to fix it being quickened again, and purged from his fil|thy earth and superfluous humidity, with the water which we have described in the book, by me published, of the Spagyrick preparation: But if all men doe not understand that descripti|on 68 [...] 69 [...] 70 for the dark words of Art, it shall not be incommodious to fix the Mercury with common Strong Water, three times poured on and drawn away, and to bring it into a red powder, and that with a sufficient violent fire, that all the sharpnesse and venome of the menstrew may be drawn away, which shall much the better be done, if this water following be mingled with it, and by often distillation separated.

Make Amalgama with {ounce}. iiii. of Mercury crude, and {ounce}. i. of the best Tinne; spread this upon a plate of Iron, and set it in a moist place, and all will dissolve into oyle, it is also made with Mercury alone, and a plate of Tinne."},{"pageNumber":322,"pageContent":"Mercury, as the manner is, three times sublimed with Salt of Vitriol, at the last is mingled with the like portion of salt Ar|moniack, and again sublimed three or four times, all that sub|limate is dissolved into oyle, out of which the spirit of the salt Armoniack is to be drawn away; circulate all with the Essence of Wine, and distill it so long, untill the oyle have lost his heat and sharpnesse, and the Armoniack be separated. It is also reduced by it self into an oyle, with a very soft heat of an Athanor, by long distance of time. Sublime Mercury so often, with the simple Calx of Eggs 71 well prepared, untill it be utterly extinct; to this mixture pour Vinegar distilled, alcool sated, that it may cover it four fin|gers; distil the liquor from the feces four or five times, until the Mercury be come into a very red powder, which you shall circulate with an alcool of Wine in a Pellican eight dayes, separate the alcool by a Limbeck, and there will remain in the bottome, the most pretious and sweet Balm of Mercury: It healeth all desperate Ulcers, and also carbunculam in vesica, and greatly helpeth these Wounds by gun-shot.

Of this with the spirit of Wine alcolizat by circulations, you shall make a red oyle, most excellent for all inward He|meroides, or Issues of blood, and to strengthen the bowels, if one drop be mixed with conserve of Roses, or Confery, or gi|ven with Wine. The filings of Iron first well washed, you shall calcine with the flower of Sulphur, or dissolve with Strong Water, then pour on very sharp Vinegar, and set it in a warm place cer|tain dayes, then reverberate it with an open fire, as Art com|mandeth, one whole day, gathering alwayes the flowers which remain above, untill all be converted into a very red and light powder. After the same manner you shall make the Balme, Oyle, 72 and Crocus of Copper, out of the which, with the four flame of Vitriol, circulating all artificially, you shall draw a blew|ish Vitriol, whose qualities we have described in another place. Out of Saturne calcined is drawn a sweetish salt in Balneo with distilled Vinegar, pouring it so often upon the Feces un|till it draw no more: The menstrew evaporated, the salt re|maineth in the bottome, which by often dissolutions, and coa|gulations, is made Christaline, and afterward easily dissolved into oyle, being set in a moist place.

Mingle Antimony with Sugar and Allum, and put all into a Retort of glasse, make a soft fire for four or five houres, afterward increase it, and there will come out an Oyle red like bloud: It is also done with Mercury sublimate, but great heed is to be taken, lest any errour be committed in the degree of fire. Boil Sulphur prepared with oyle of Linseed, with a very soft fire, and it will be like bloud congealed: Let the matter cool, put it into a Retort, and give it fire, and there will distil out a very red oyle of Sulphur: It is also done, if you mingle Bran with your Sulphur and distil it. Take of Sulphur Vivum P. i. with which mingle, with a soft fire, so much pure Vitriol molten, that it may be one body; 75 distil this by a Discentory, and there will descend a red oyle into the Receiver. If lb . i. of the flower of Sulphur be mixed with ii. or iii. lb . of oyle of Turpentine in a dry heat, the flowers will dissolve into a red oyle; then the menstrew rightly and artificially se|parate, circulate the rubin of Sulphur with the Alcool of Wine eight dayes, and you shall have oyle of Sulphur that hath the qualities of the natural Balm. The sour oyle of Sulphur is made by Sulphur, by setting it on a fire, and hanging over it a bell, or a large glasse head, to keep the vapours which are converted into that sour oyle. Put Vitriol beaten into powder into a Cucurbite, giving it a fire of the second degree, and there will issue a sour water, which is called the flegm of Vitriol. Take the Feces which remaineth in the bottome of the vessel, which is called Colcothar, stamp that, and if you min|gle flints withal, with a violent fire, there will come out a red oyle. It is also made with the simple Colcothar, driven out with a violent fire three dayes space, and there will come forth a very hot oyle, which is made sweet by circulation, with spirit of Wine tartarizated.

SInce many sad and incommodious things are wont to happen to women with child, and in bringing them into the world by ignorance and carelessnesse: I thought I should undertake a thing not unbe|seeming a Christian Physitian, if I should reduce, as it were, into a breif Comment, what things were fit to observe, as well in their time of bearing, as also in the birth, from which, being somewhat more instructed, they might better enjoy their health, preserve their off-spring, and after birth better defend their bodies. CHAP. I. What things are to be taken heed of in the two first Moneths. SO soon as the woman shall begin to be with child, which she shall easily know, by stopping of her monethly flux, 2 without disease, or ancientnesse of yeares; she shall abstain from all vehement motions and exercise, whether she walk on foot, or ride on horseback, or in a Coach, or be carried in a Horse-litter; For where the body is too much stirred, the internall membrane of the Womb is either accustomed to be broken, or to be loosly resolved, and thereupon abort|ment presently followeth. To these things the woman with child must diligently be|ware, that she lift not her armes up too high, nor carry great burthens, nor repose her self on hard and uneasie seats: But instead of exercise, which may alwayes in some precede be|fore meat, she may walk on foot gently, or suffer her body and armes gently to be rubbed and stroked, or may stretch them forth with spinning or carding. Let her moderately use meat of good juyce and easie con|coction, and Wine not too strong and too sharp, but a little mingled with water, or if she be abstemious, she may use water wherein Cinnamon is boyled: But she may not feed on sweet meats, sharp, and windy; she must also avoid fa|sting, thirst, watching, mourning, sadnesse, anger, and all other perturbations of the mind."},{"pageNumber":329,"pageContent":"Her familiar freinds must present no unwholsome thing to her, nor so much as name it, least she should desire it, and not be able to get it, and so minister her an occasion of abort|ment, or the Child carry with it some foule impressions. But if she desire chalk, clay, or coales, let beanes boyled with sugar be given unto her: or if she cannot get her long|ing, let her presently drink a large draught of pure cold water. CHAP. II. Order for the third Moneth. BEfore the fourth moneth be ended, she must neither be let bloud, nor have her body evacuated with any purga|tive medicine. But if too much bloud abound, or some incident disease 3 happen, which may require evacuation, you shall use cupping-glasses with scarification, and a little may be drawn from the shoulders and arme, especially if she have been formerly accustomed to them. CHAP. III. From the fourth Moneth. VVHen now the fourth moneth is past, bloud-letting and physick is permitted, especially if it be gentle, and milde, such as best may agree with women with child, and tender or delicate persons: And by Hyppocrates pre|cept may be conceded even untill the seventh moneth. CHAP. IIII. From the fifth,, sixth, and seventh Moneth, FRom that time forward none of the before mentioned remedies is wont, or ought from thence to be used, because the Babe being now become greater, standeth in need of greater nourishment and bloud, and also can bear no commo|tion of physick. Although sometimes I have met with women, which have so much abounded with bloud, that unlesse they had been let bloud in the second moneth, they would have aborted in the third; others again, unlesse they should attempt the same in the seventh or eight moneth, they could not carry their great belly so long, or else would be delivered of a dead issue. But since these things happen but to few, they may not be granted to all, but we must provide for every one according to their nature and constitution. And this is to be prohibited to all which are with child, that they give not way to take any bloud from the ancle bone of the foot, during the whole time of the womans going, but in stead thereof,"},{"pageNumber":330,"pageContent":"if the disease so require, an ounce of Manna in the broth of a Cock, or so much Cassia fistula, 4 or of Sirrups made of Damask-roses infused in May dew, about the quantity of an ounce, with a little water of Cinna|mon, may safely be taken a little before meat. But if the belly be bound onely without any apparent disease, the broth of a Chicken, or of Veal sodden, with Oil, or with the decoction of Mallowes, or marsh-Mallowes, Mer|cury, and Linseed, put up in a glister by the lower parts will not be amisse, yet in a lesser measure then is wont to be gi|ven in other Children, to wit, of the decoction five ounces, of common Oil three ounces, of Sugar two ounces, of Cassia fistula one ounce.

But of fat Pork, which they call Lard, or the yolks of Eggs without salt, Purgations and Glysters are commended. But if she will not take a Glyster, either for modesty or otherwise, because she was not accustomed to take it, one or two yolks of new laid Eggs, or a few Pease pottage warm, with a little salt and sugar, supped up a little before meat, will be very conve|nient.

The eighth Moneth IN the eighth moneth, which is usually perillous, the better diets, rather than plentiest, will be most commodious. But as they must abate their diet, so their bodily exercise must increase. And because then women with child, by reason of the sharp humours alter the belly, are accustomed to weaken both their spirits and strength; they may well take 5 before meat an Electuary of Diarrhodon, or Aromaticum Ro|satum, or Diamargariton, in the morning before meat, and sometimes they may [...]ick a little Honey; even as they which loath and nauseate their meat, may take green Ginger con|dited with Sugar, or the rindes of Citrons and Oranges condited; as also it is usuall sometimes to take specificall Sirrups. Moreover, let the woman with child often use Ho|ney for the strengthning of the Infant. When she is not farre from her labour, or bringing forth, she shall eat daily seven tosted Figs before meat, least the seconds may be bound up; but if they shall be restrained and stay firme, they may be resolved: But the woman with child may not eat salt and powdered meats, least the child be born without nails.

But we must beware, that such sweet smells of this kind be not used to the nostrils, but rather Balls of Galbanum, Assa soetida, Mirrh, or Rue. 8 What Meat is most usefull. Then Pottage of Hens, Capons, and such like are most in use; and I should advise them then to drink thinne generous Wine allayed with water. What manner of Chamber, the woman with child should lye in. It doth not a little avail to the happy delivery, that the Chamber, wherein the Child-bearing woman lyeth, be tem|perate, and be neither too cold nor too hot, for that shutteth up the mouth of the womb, and this disperseth and digesteth the strength. In Summer time therefore if heat scorcheth, the Chamber may be strowed with Willow leaves, and Vine leaves, and Rose-water, with a little Vinegar. In Winter, a high or upper Chamber, moderately kept warm, shall be con|venient, which shall be kept warm with a continued fire, as is accustomed to be done in Italy, France, and other hot Countries. But this is expedient every where, that the natural parts, and those nearest unto them, be moderately rubbed with hot clothes. CHAP. VII. What is to be done at the birth. THe birth being at hand, and paines oppressing them, it shall be fit, if the belly doe fall down of its own accord, but if it be bound, it must be provoked with a gentle Glyster; for the excrements being cast out, the womb and the passa|ges, thorough which the Child issueth, are lesse pressed, and so the birth followeth more easie"},{"pageNumber":334,"pageContent":"These things being well prepared, the child-bed woman must be put into bed, if tender, weak, grosse, and fleshly; but it ought to be made ready after this manner. 9 How, and wherewith, the child-bed womans bed ought to be fur|nished. A large boulster made of linnen cloth, must be stuffed with straw, and be spread on the ground, that her upper part may lye higher than her lower; on this the woman may lye, so that she may seem to lean and bow, rather than to lye drawing up her feet unto her, that she may receive no hurt. CHAP. VIII. To whom the seat may agree and be fit. LEt the strong and lusty women be placed in a chair, which also must have the lower part not upright, but stooping a little, that the child-bearing woman may sit, as it were, bend|ing backward, clothes, or close compassing garments, being cast about their backs. In this the belly, together with the whole burthen, may sooner goe down than in a bed; but it often cometh to passe, that the whole Babe lyeth at the mouth of the womb, before that it shall get forth, more loosly and openly with the ad|joyning places, and by that meanes is compelled to stick lon|ger there, from whence ariseth no small danger of life, CHAP. IX. What the Midwife shall doe in the very moment of the birth. VVHen now the pangs of child-bearing women increase more and more, let the Midwife inwardly annoint the secret or natural parts with oyle of Cammomil, and white Lillies, nor let her set the woman in the seat, before she per|ceiveth the womb to be loosed and resolved, and the humours to flow over more plentifully. Moreover, she may not bring her to labour and strugling, before the birth shew it self to her view; for they doe but labour in vain, and doe violently distort and wrest away the strength of the labouring woman, that afterward, 10 when she shall have need, it will not be able to work it forth. But she shall sit fitly over against the woman in labour, and shall diligently observe on what part the birth moveth it self; for if it come the right way, she shall annoint and cherish the secret parts"},{"pageNumber":335,"pageContent":"with odoriferous Oils; and if it de|clineth to the sides, she shall with both hands govern and dispose the belly, that it may fall to the mouth of the womb. And if the hand or feet shew it self first, the Midwife, with a soft and gentle hand, moistened with broth of Fenugreek and Linseed, shall gently reduce it into the place. Certain women have the mouth of their womb so streight|ned, that without great help, scarce or never they can part with the child. And that cometh to pass by reason of divers cau|ses; for either some strong heat coming from the natural parts, doth two much streighten the inward parts, or the Creature is to big, or the child-bearing woman is to grosse and fat, or the child is dead, who cannot by motion be furthering and helping to nature, or else cold for the most part in the winter, especially in young ones, who have a narrow passage of the womb, doth more astringe and bind it up; or some|times heat in some is so dissolved, that their strength faileth them in the birth. Therefore when there appeareth difficulty in bringing forth the Child, Jesus Christ, the onely preserver and saver in danger, is heartily to be called upon, that with his gra|tious favour he would be pleased to be Assistant to the wretched party in travell. CHAP. X. When the Infant is come into the world. VVHen now the Child, or Issue, cometh into the world either with the head or feet, the Mother must be in|couraged, that as much as in her lyeth, she keep in her breath and restrain it, that by that indeavour she may put forth the Child. And the Midwife, in the mean time, must with he[...] 11 hand gently compresse and keep down the region of the womb, which is above the navill, and urge the Infant to the lower parts: And although the astriction of the womb cau|seth the bringing forth to be more difficult, the parturient woman is to be set in a Bath, in which Mallowes, Faenugreek, Linseed, and Barly are sodden, and the sides, hips, and flank, must be annointed, with oyle of Roses and Violets: let the thighs be well rubbed, with Oxysacchar. and half a drachm of Mint, and as much of Wormwood, be exhibited in drink to her: The woman bringing forth may gently be led to her bed; and they which assist her at her labour, must not look or gaze in her face, as such who are ashamed in their bring|ing forth, that after it, as it falleth out, she strive not to bring forth her young one with sharper pain. CHAP. XI If the Secondines break not readily. BUt if the Skin containing the young one, called the Se|condine, because it is brought forth after the birth, be lesse easily broken, but stifly resisteth, the Midwife must either break it with her nails, and laying hold on it with her fingers, cut it with a pair of Sizzers, taking care that the Child may be preserved safely in doing it: On the contrary, when the skins are broken or cut in peices, if all the humours presently shall overflow before the child come forth, and the naturall"},{"pageNumber":336,"pageContent":"places shall be dried up, let Goose greace, with oyle of white Lillies melted, be poured in warm, or the white of an Egg with the yolk be put up. What is to be done after the child is born, if yet the Secondine, or after-birth, be retained. If the Child being born, the Secondines be as yet perti|naciously retained, sneezing must be provoked, if it come not voluntarily, putting Ginger or some other sharp thing up into the nostrils; or a scruple of Unicorns horn beaten into pow|der ought to be drunk hot in white Wine (in want of Unicorns 12 horn use good Harts horn, or Bezar four graines) or the juyce of Borrage exhibited in drink bringeth them down, because it easily moveth vomit, and they thereby are brought forth. Another approved Remedy for drawing them forth.  Take of Sesely, Cinnamon,  Of Mirrh, and of sweet Cassia, of each equall parts.  Let these be exhibited with Mugwort-water. Another Receit.

To draw forth a dead Child. IF the child be dead, an equall quantity of Rue, of Mug|wort, Wormwood, and black Pepper, being each of them reduced into fine powder, and boyled in Wine, must be ex|hibited, or Vervain boyled in Wine, or Water, or Vinegar; or Savory bruised and tied upon the belly bringeth forth the Child, whether it be yet alive or dead; or Butter with Ho|ney boyled in Wine; or decoction of Hysop well dryed ex|hibited in hot water: but if it yeildeth not, nor cometh away with these, let Rue, Mugwort, Oppoponax, and Wormwood dryed, with a little Oil and Sugar, be laid to the groin, or the navill; and moreover, the skin of a female Snake put about the woman in the manner"},{"pageNumber":337,"pageContent":"of a girdle. Also the stone Aetites, tied unto the thigh, after the Child is brought forth, ought presently to be taken away, least the womb, after the Child be brought forth, come forth also. Moreover, sneezing alone accellerateth delivery, but it ought to be used with the mouth and nostrils close stopped, and Ginger, or some such thing, put up into them; for from 13 hence a great force of the spirits is thrust thence unto the inward part. CHAP. XIII. How the bellies of child-bearing women, being costive or bound may be loosned. IF the belly doe not evacuate the excrements, the first dayes of her being brought to bed, bring a Fig, cut in the middle, into the form of a sharp tent fashioned like a mans Yeard, and put it up into the Fundament instead of a Suppository; or else put a grain of Coriander, confected with Sugar, up into that place; or put a peice of Swines flesh powdered, or Lard, brought into the same form, up into the same place, or frame a Suppository of white Sope, and apply it thereto. About four or five dayes after the birth, you may use a gentle Glister of half a pound of Sallade oyle, with a quar|tern of Barly boyled in broth, with two ounces of Sugar, with the yolke of an Egg, beaten together. But if at the eighth day the belly answer not their expecta|tion in loosenesse, let three drachms of Cassia newly extracted, well confected with Sugar, be taken morning and at evening before supper in the manner of a bole, and presently let her eat thereupon. CHAP. XIV What things are to be applied to the naturall or secret parts. SO soon as the Child is born, let this astringent Fomen|tation be applied unto the naturall parts. The Fomentation. Take of red Ro|ses two pugils; a pugill is the quantity you may take up at once between your first three forefingers. Let them be boyled to a third part, in high red Wine in|clining to a blackish colour, with a fourth part of water put thereunto, then put into the decoction a whole Egg, and let 14 it be mingled together, and applied to the place, with flanen rowlers, and kept on for the space of two dayes."},{"pageNumber":338,"pageContent":" Another. Take of oyle of Hypericon four ounces. Of Rose-water two ounces. Of the juyce of Solomons Seal one ounce.

Take two ounces of Rose-water. An ounce of Mirtles. Half an ounce of Cats fat. These things ought to be melted, and mingled with the before recited Oyles. A Girdle for the belly. After the Unction, put on a Girdle of Dog-skin, well pre|pared by a Leather-dresser, and annointed with two ounces of oyle of Mirtles, and one ounce of oyle of Mastick, and half an ounce of oyle of Hypericon mingled together. But it must be so large, as it may comprehend or compasse the whole belly a little above the navill, even unto the natu|rall parts, and must streightly bind up the same, but without pain. And this will be fitly done, if it be sowed together with thred on the left side, and be put hot enough to the belly, and be compassed with four or five double linnen clothes, binding them with fit strings together, that the belly may be kept warm.

It is convenient to put to the belly, a plaister made with the white of an Egg, and a little Pepper, and taken with flaxen rowlers, or boulsters. On the ninth day. If this plaister please not, besmear a Dogs skin again with oyle of Mirtles and Mastick, and apply it unto the belly, and it will avail and profit much, to keep it tied with swadling clothes unto the end of her child-bed.

LEt there be given unto the Infant new born Honey to lick, after let it be nourished with the Mothers Milk, which of all things best agreeth with it. But if by reason of some necessity it cannot enjoy it, a sound healthy Nurse is to be chosen, neither younger than four and twenty yeares, nor elder than five and thirty, of a white and ruddy complexion, which is not infected with other vices, nor yet hath too lately been brought to bed, nor hath not long given suck; let her not have sore Dugs or Breasts, nor to big, but a large Breast, and moderately fat. Let her use choise meats of easie and light concoction, engendring good bloud or juyce; let her ab|stain from hot aromaticall Spices, as Pepper, Ginger, Car|damome, and such like; also from Leeks, Onions, Garlick, Salt, austere and tart things: Let her avoid strong Wines, as also cold water: Let her eschew immoderate eating and drinking, for that corrupteth the Milk, and begetteth in chil|dren lepry, or scurfe, and other contagious diseases: Let her 19 abstain from cares and vexations, and let her take heed, least she provoke her menstruous disease. She must not sleep much, or be given to sleep, for that maketh the Milk flegmatick; she likewise ought not to watch more than is meet, for from hence the Milk cometh to be more hot, sharp, and distastfull to the Infant; she ought moderately to excrcise her selfe, especially her armes, to wit, either in sowing, spinning, or knitting, for by this meanes evill humours are consumed, as by ease and sloth they are augmented."},{"pageNumber":343,"pageContent":"Also copulation of the Nurse exceedingly offendeth, and hurteth the Child, as that which cheifly retracteth and di|minisheth the Milk, and maketh it of an unsavory taste, ta|sting hot, and rank, or goatish, which bringeth no small inconvenience, and hurt to the Child. For which cause, in times past, Husbands were driven away from their Wives, and restrained from their companies. But if the Milk decrease, Pultesses of Bean meal, and Rise, are meet to be used; also like paps made of Bread, with Milk, and Sugar, to which may be added a little Fennel|seed. And if the Milk be thick, it must be made thinne, with slen|der diet, and subtill Wine, and Sirrup of Vinegar, as also with exercises: But if it be too thinne, and waterish, grosse, and strong meats, and longer sleeps will be convenient and meet. For the corruption of the Milk, a litile Mug vort grosly bruised, and put into a linnen cloth, and so into broth, with a little Honey added thereto, will doe very much good. The care of the Infant. And if the Childes belly be loose, the food ought to be more grosse and strong, and her sleeps longer: But children may suck so long, as till they have brought forth sharp and great teeth: But if you suffer them to drink Wine, or strong drink, or other Potions, before they have toothed them, they will be corrupted; but when they have gotten these teeth, 20 their armes, and back bones are gently to be rubbed after their sleep. CHAP. XVIII. A Bath of sweet water, very profitable for children, as by whose meanes they may grow up and increase. THey are, fasting, to be bathed in water before meat, for the space of a quarter of an hour, yet so, that the belly may first goe down or be emptied, and then they are to be annointed with oyle of Olives made hot. And it is not of little concernment, in what swadling clothes children are wrapped; for when they are not tied up at all, or the clouts are too loose, they are subject to Fluxes, Imposthumes, apt to be crooked backt, and other discommo|dities; but especially when their knees are too strictly tied and bound up, and their thighs left at liberty, they are la|med. When they cry, or feel pain, or will sleep, they are to be pacified, either by shewing the breast, or by singing, or by rocking, either in Cradles, or hanging Beds, or by carrying up and down. But we must observe, that children may lie strait whensoever they lie down, and ought not to be co|vered too much, or hot with coverings, nor yet with too few, least they may catch cold."},{"pageNumber":344,"pageContent":"Moreover, let the linnen cloth, wherein they are wrapped, be neat and clean, for children are offended, and infected by foul and filthy excrements. From three years of age till the seventh, they are to be educated gently and kindly, not to be severely reprehended, chidden, or beaten, for by that meanes they be made through|out their whole life after too timorous, or too much terrified, astonished, and sotted. Being yet in their first years, they are not to be compelled to going, for seeing all their bones are soft as Wax, and the body fall the heavier, they either become lame, or universally resolved in their feet. Food must be daily given them thrice a day, till they are 21 three years old; for if they be much filled, they are sub|ject and accustomed to be troubled with Convulsions, and other diseases. In the sixth or seventh year of their age, they are to be sent to schoole, and committed to the breeding and instruction of courteous and temperate Schoolmasters, who may not ter|rifie them. Before these yeares they are not to be compelled or for|ced to harder labours; otherwise they will not thrive well, but stand at a stay, and keep little, or become Dwarfes. CHAP. XIX. The Diseases of Infants. VVHen as the Infant beginneth to grow sick, as for example, from a cold disease, the Nurse is to be nourished with hot and dry meat and drink, so that thereby forthwith it may grow well again; so also if it be taken with other diseases, as with an Ague, the Nurse shall use plantain water, and such like things, Paps made for children of crums or morsels of bread broken or sliced, are more wholesome, than made of meal or flour. Till two years old give them Honey often, for that keepeth them from Convulsions, and costivenesse of the belly, and that the milk they eat hurt them not. When Infants cast up their milk, a Corrall should be hung about their neck down to their middle; for it is use|full for them in teething, and Ivory also is good for the same purpose. Diseases and Symptomes, proceeding from the birth, in women with child.

In some the wrinkled skin of the Cods is broken from the birth, so that there is but one hole between the womb and the fundament, and the same course, whereby oftentimes the womb goeth forth and is hardened; therefore the diseased parts must be cherished with hot Wine, in which Butter hath been resolved, untill the Matrix be softned, and then it must be gently put up: after the Cod skin is broken in three or four places, it must be sowed up with a silken thred; presently let a linnen cloth be put upon the belly, according to the large|nesse of it; lastly, let it be annointed with Tar, for the womb, by reason of the evill scent, is drawn in again. At last we heal the Rupture with powder of both Comferies, and Cummin, sprinkled upon them. But a child-bed woman is to be put to bed, so that she may have her feet lie the higher; let her lie there eight or nine dayes continually, and let her take her meat, ease her self, and make water there. She must abstain from bathing so long as possibly she may, also from all those things which may provoke coughing, and from meats which cannot easily be digested: And for preven|ting this danger in bringing forth, let a long ball of linnen cloth be made, and put up into her Fundament, and as often 23 as the child-bearing woman striveth to bring forth the Infant, let her strongly compresse and keep in her belly, that no dis|ruption or rupture be made in these parts. CHAP. XXI. For windinesse or Collick of the belly. IF the secret or naturall parts receive wind in, which being kept in brings forth pain, a Fomentation made with the de|coction of Mustard or Onions, is vety good."},{"pageNumber":346,"pageContent":"Also sometimes in others so great plenty and abundance of wind oppresseth them, that they seem broken, or as those trou|bled with the Isiack passion, for whose ease, a Bath made of Mallowes, Pellitory of the wall, and the like, must be used, and the belly often kept soluble. But she ought to stay the longer in the Bath, and when she cometh out of it, a plaister of the juyce of Mullein, or Turnup, and Barly meal, must be laid on hot, and then let her use her Bath again, CHAP. XXII. For the Itch. IF those parts itch, so that women by scratching take away the skin, whereupon blysters arise, which greatly molest and trouble them, they ought to be annointed with the Ointment prescribed for burnings. Take an Apple, Bol[...] armoniack, Mastick, Frankincense, Oyle, hot Wine, Wax, and Tallow, and thus you may pre|pare it. Purge the Apple from the outward rind, and the core, and put it in a pot to the fire, with the Oyle, Wax, and Tallow, and when it shall be hot, the Mastick and Frankincense, being reduced into powder, must be put in, and then being mingled strained through a cloth. 24 CHAP. XXIII. For the Flux of bloud. FOr those unto whom an immoderate Flux of bloud hap|peneth, it shall be convenient to give the juyce of Mugwort, Sage, Pennyroyall, and of other hearbs of that kind, made up into the form of a Sirrup. Also Baths made for the same disease of the said hearbs, are good; or by a plaister made up with Clay and Vinegar, which must be applied to the right side. If the Flux of bloud come from the nostrils, it must be ap|plied to the forehead and temples, having a respect to the con|trary side: For bloud useth not to flow out of the nostrils, unlesse a male Child be begotten. CHAP. XXIV. For the falling down of the Matrix from the birth."},{"pageNumber":347,"pageContent":"A Bath made of Mugwort, Flea-bane, Juniper, Camphire, and Wormwood, boyled in water; let the child-bed wo|man sit in this up to the breast, afterwards let her be gently put into her bed, and let her lie with her feet drawn backward, that the Matrix may return into its place. The Womb being put into its place again, put powder of Penniroyall, of Galingale, Spikenard, Nutmegs, Avence, with oyle of Nutmegs, and Penniroyall into a fine thinne cloth, and in manner of a Ball or Pessary bind it up, and put it into the Womb, and shut up the orifice of the Matrix, that it fall not down again: But have a care, that it may peirce backward toward the reins, and there it is to be bound up, but before that be performed, a plaister of Bay berries, of Mustard, Fran|kincense, and of Cinnamon, of each as much as shall be suffici|ent, being brought into powder, and being heated at the fire, mingled with Honey, and let it be laid to the back being yet hot, and bound up with a swath, wherewith the Pessary, put up into the Matrix, is tied. 25 But let the woman brought to bed lie in her bed upward for the space of nine dayes or more, if need require, so that she may not move her self up and down, unlesse great ne|cessity urgeth her; and such meat shall be given her, which may not easily passe through her belly, or may not often provoke her to make water: But now going abroad after her delivery, we must put on an intire garment that may keep it in, least it goe out again, unlesse it be when she maketh water. The third day we must make ready a Bath, and then, least they should swell, powder of Ginger, Pellitory of the wall, and Cinnamon, of every one by equall parts mixed must be blown up. CHAP. XXV. For the Piles after the birth. VVEe use to cure the Piles, arising from the fault of the bringing forth, with a Bath of Wormwood, Southern|wood; Cinnamon rind, and the bark of Cassia fistula, boyled well in Wine; when the woman delivered goeth forth of the Bath, put Bombace, or Cotton, with powder of Alloes mixed with oyle of Penniroyall unto her lower parts. CHAP. XXVI. Against pain of the Breasts, contracted by too much Milk. CLay kneaded with Vinegar, after the manner of a plaister, is available to astringe and keep back the Milk, but the place is first to be suppled with hot water. CHAP. XXVII. For the Imposthume of the Breasts. A Plaister of marsh-Mallowes, Mallowes, Wormwood, Mugwort, and Swines greace, made up according to art is very profitable; when the swelling is come unto the height, lay Nut kernels"},{"pageNumber":348,"pageContent":"bruised to peices unto it: And if the 26 Imposthume break not, let it be launced with a Launcet or Pen-knife, and squeeze it a little, least by the suddain eva|cuation a worse mischeevious Imposthume may come upon it; and when it is broken, put in a linnen cloth, twice or thrice a day, smeared with the yolk of an Egg and Turpentine, which strengtheneth exceedingly: And if the Imposthume chance to passe into a Fistula, put into it a root of black Hellebor dipped in Oyle or Honey; or sprinkle powder of the colt-Bur upon it, for with these is every Fistula purged and destroyed, so as it be not between the bones; wherefore these Medicines are so long to be administred, untill it dye, and be dried up, and afterward the Ulcer be cured. 27 Some few additionall Observations, concerning the passages in ths for|mer Treatise. CHAP. XXVIII. What is to be administred unto the Child, after it is born, for the first thing it taketh. ARnoldus de villa nova, a most learned Phisitian, writeth, that if you give unto a Child half a scruple of Corrall finely powdered, with womans milk, first, before it taketh any o|ther thing, after it is born, that it shall ne|ver be troubled with the falling Sicknesse. Also, I know persons of good quality in this our Country of England (I presume, instructed by some able Phisitians) who give unto all their own children (and advise all other wo|men, where they are desired to be assistant at the birth) to exhibite unto the children new born, the first thing they take, a little Salt well mingled in a spoonfull of Saxifrage, or Hysop water, to prevent the trouble of frets, and other diseases in children following their birth. Conceiving also, as they suppose, they have some ground for their action, from the fourth verse of the sixteenth Chapter of Ezekiel, where the Lord, reckoning up the Midwives du|ties about children, at that time of their nativity, thus speaketh. 28 And as for thy nativity, in the day thou wast born, thy navill was not cut, neither wast thou washed in water to supple thee, thou wast not salted at all, nor swadled at all. "},{"pageNumber":349,"pageContent":" CHAP. XXIX. For Infants troubled with wind and flegm. MAny Midwives advise the Nurses, to give them a little pure Sugar-candie finely bruised in Saxifrage water, or Scabious water in a spoon, well mingled together. CHAP. XXX. A most excellent Medicine to cause children to teeth easily. TAke of pure Capons greace, very well clarified, the quan|tity of a Nutmeg, and twice as much of pure Honey, min|gle and incorporate them well together, and three or four times in a day annoint the Childs gummes when they are teething, and they will break flesh easily, and prevent tor|ments, and Agues, and other greifs, which usually accompany their coming forth. CHAP. XXXI. For Agues in Children. TAke a spoonfull of good oyle of Populeon, and put thereunto two spoonfuls of good oyle of Roses, mingle and incorporate them well together, and then warm it before the fire, annoint the Childs bowing places, his armes, legs soles of his feet, and also his forehead, and temples twice a day, chafing the ointment well in.

CHAP. XXXIII. For Heart-Wormes. HEberstreit, Skonkius, Hollerius, and other Phisitians af|firme, they have seen them in persons dissected: One in a Prince, another in a Citizen of Florence; and our London Phisitians of late yeares have seen two in London (as appeares in Doctor Mayes book of Mr Pennant of Saint Giles in the Feilds) who dyed having a Worm like a Serpent in his heart."},{"pageNumber":350,"pageContent":" The Cure. Skonkius out of Stocherus affirmeth by certain experiment, that the juyce of Raddish, Garlick, and Mustard, killeth these Wormes, which breeding in the chest of the heart, cause swoun|dings, Epilepsies, and many times death. CHAP. XXXIV. To cause a young Child to goe to stoole. CHafe the Childs navill with May Butter before the fire, then take some black Wooll, that groweth between a Sheeps legs, and dip it in the May Butter, and then dry it, and lay it unto the navill, and it will procure a stoole: This is also good for one in yeares, who can take no inward Medicine. 30 Another certain Experiment. Take a good big green Mallow strig, and strip off the outward skin, and annoint the strig well with fresh But|ter, and put it up into the Childes Fundament, and let it stay a while there, and in very short space it will procure a stoole.

Secundum Artem, according to Art."},{"pageNumber":386,"pageContent":"So much as shall suffice is marked thus q. s 1 A defensative against the Plague. The first Treatise CHAP. I. What the Plague is. THe antient Phisitians in times past have greatly doubted, what the essentiall cause of this dis|ease, which we commonly call the Plague or Pestilence, should be; yet all doe agree, that it is a pernitious and contagious Fever, and reckoned to be one of the number of those which are called Epidemia, chiefly proceeding of adusted and melancholy bloud, which may be easily perceived, by the extream heat and inflammation, which inwardly they doe feel, that are infected therewith; first assaulting the heart, and astonishing the vitall spirits, as also by the exteriour Carbunkles and botches which it produceth; whose malignity is such, both in young and old, rich and poor, noble and ignoble, that using all the meanes, which by Art can, or may be devised, yet in some it will in no sort give place, untill it hath by death con|quered the party infected therewith. CHAP. II. Cause of the Plague. THere are divers causes whereof this disease may pro|ceed, as sundry Writers doe alledge, as by over great and unnaturall heat and drought, by great rain and inundations of waters, or by great store of rotten and stinking bodies, 2 both of men and beasts, lying upon the face of the earth un|buried, as in the time of warres hath been seen, which doth so corrupt the air, as that thereby our Corn, Fruits, Hearbs, and Waters, which we daily use for our food and sustenance, are infected: also it may come by some stinking dunghils, fil|thy and standing pooles of water, and unsavory smels, which are near the places where we dwell, or by thrusting a great company of people into a close, narrow, or streight room, as most commonly we see in Ships, common Gaoles, and in narrow and close lanes and streets, where many people doe dwell together, and the places not orderly kept clean and sweet. But most commonly, in this our time, it is dispersed amongst us, by accompanying our selves with such as either have, or lately have had the disease themselves, or at least have been conversant with such as have been infected there|with: But for the most part it doth come by receiving into our custody some clothes, or such like things, that have been used about some infected body, wherein the infection may lie hidden a long time, as hath been too too often experi|mented, with repentance too late in many places, It may also come by Dogs, Cats, Pigs, and Weasels, which are prone and apt to receive and carry the infection from place to place. But howsoever it doth come, let us assure our selves, that it is a just punishment of God, laid upon us for our manifold sins and transgressions against his divine Majesty: for as Seneca saith, Quicquid patimur ab alto venit, What crosses or afflicti|ons soever"},{"pageNumber":387,"pageContent":"we suffer, it cometh from the Lord, either for a triall of our faith, or a punishment for our sins. Wherefore to distinguish any farther thereof I think it needlesse, for my intent is in breif sort, so exactly as I can, to shew the meanes how to prevent the same, as also how to cure it when we are infected. But before I enter to treat thereof, I think it not amisse, to shew what forewarnings and tokens are given us before hand of the coming thereof, thereby the better to pre|vent the same by prayer and repentance. 3 CHAP. III. Warnings of the Plague to come. A Vicen, a noble Physitian saith, that when wee see the natu|rall course of the ayre, and seasons of the year to be alte|red, as when the spring time is cold, clowdy, and dry, the har|vest time stormy, and tempestuous, the mornings and evenings to be very cold, and at noon extream hot, these do foreshew the Plague to come. Also when we see fiery impressions in the firmament, especially in the end of summer, as comets and such like, and that in the begining of harvest we see great store of little frogs, red toades, and myse on the earth aboun|ding extraordinarily: or when in summer we see great store of toades creeping on the earth having long tailes, of an ashy color on their backs, and their bellies spotted and of divers co|lours, and when we see great store of gnats swiming on the wa|ters, or flying in great companies together, or when our trees and hearbs do abound with Caterpillars, Spiders, Moaths &c. which devoure the leaves on the trees and hearbs on the earth, it sheweth the ayre to be corrupt, and the Plague shortly after to follow. Also by the beasts of the field we may perceive it (especially sheep) which will go mourning with their heads hanging down towards the ground, and divers of them dying without any manifest cause known unto us. Also when we see young Children flock themselves together in companies, and then will faine some one of their company to be dead amongs them, and so will solemnize the buriall in a mournfull sort, this is a token which hath been well observed in our age to foreshew great mortality at hand. Also when we see rivers of water to overflow without any manifest cause, or suddenly vanish away and become dry: And when clear well-springs do suddenly become foule and troubled. Also when the small-Pox doth generally abound both in young and old people, all these do foreshew the Plague to come. 4 CHAP. IIII. Sheweth how to prevent the Plague. THere are three principall meanes how to prevent this con|tagious disease: The first and chiefest is to acknowledge our manifold sins and wickedness unto almighty God our hea|venly Father, with a hearty repentance and amendment of our former sins committed against his divine majestie."},{"pageNumber":388,"pageContent":"The second means is to fly far off from the place infected, and as Rondoletius saith, not over hastily to return thither again for fear of an after-clap: which saying is confirmed by Vale|tius in these words, Non enim morietur in bello, qui non est in illo: and the farther from it, the safer shall we be, yet were it a very uncharitable course that all which are of abillity should do so, for then how should the poor be relieved, and good orders observed: but for Children it were best to send them far off from the place, because their bodies are most apt to receive the in|fection, as also for that they cannot so continually use antidots and preservatives, which by their great heat may indanger them almost so much as the disease it self. The third meanes consisteth chiefly in three points, which are these: Order, Diet, and Physicall helps. For the first you shall have a care that your houses be kept clean and sweet, not suffering any foule and filthy clothes or stinking things to remain in or about the same: and in summer season to deck your windowes, and strow your floors with sweet and wholsom hearbs, floures, and leaves, of Mints, Balme, Penniroyall, La|vender, Time, Majoram, red-Roses, Carnations, Gelliflow|ers and such like for your windowes, your floors to be strow|ed with green Rushes, and Mints, Oaken and Willow leaves, Vine leaves and such like: your windowes which stand to|wards the North and East, do you alwaies keep open in the day time, if the ayre be clear, and that no infected and unsa|vory smell be near the same, as Fogs, dunghils, &c. and every morning before you open either your doors, or windowes, as also in the evening when you go to bed, cause a good fire to be made in your Chamber, and burn some odoriferous or 5 sweet perfumes in the middest thereof, as hereafter I will shew you, or in stead thereof some Juniper, Frankincense, Bay leaves, Rosemary, Lavender, Majoram, or such like, which you must alwaies have dried in a readinesse, and so in the fume or smoke thereof to breath and perfume the clothes which you are to weare. A good perfume in summer season. Rx. Rose water and Vinegar, of either six spoonfulls: Rinds of sower Citrons and Lemons, Bay-leaves, of either the weight of two pence which is {scruple}. i. Camphire, the weight of three pence, which is {dram}. ss.

Red-Roses Majoram and Myrtles, of either a little handfull: Callamint, Juniper berries, Laudanum, Benjamin, Frankincense, of either {dram}. i. which is the weight of seven pence."},{"pageNumber":389,"pageContent":"The hearbs, berries, and Roses being dried, must be made in grosse powder, as also the gumms, and so mixed together, and when yee list, cast some part thereof on a chafer of coales, and receive the fume thereof. CHAP. V. NOw having received the fume as aforesaid, before you go forth of your chamber, eat some Cordial electuary or pre|servative, as hereafter you shall find choise, which I have alwais used with good and happy success, after taking of the Cordial wash your face and hands with clean water, wherein you must put a little Vinegar, and then if you list, you may break your fast wirh some good bread and butter, and in winter season a potch'd Egg is good eaten with some Vinegar, and for pletho|rick 6 and melanchole bodies, it were good to drink a draught of wormewood wine, in the morning fasting, because it resist|eth putrefaction in the plethorick, and purgeth bilous matter in the melancholie. An excellent good preservative which I have alwaies used with good successe. Rx.

Another excellent good preservative. Rx. Kernils of Wallnuts and Figs, of either four ounces: Leaves of Rue, one ounce and half, Tormentill roots, four drachms, Rind of sowr Citrons, one drachme, right Bolar|moniak, six drachms, fine Myrrh, two scruples, Saffron, one scruple, Salt, half a drachm: Sirrup of Citrons and Lemons, four ounces."},{"pageNumber":390,"pageContent":"The hearbs, roots, and rinds must be dried, the nuts must be blanched, and the bolarmoniack must be made in fine powder, and then wash'd in the water of Scabios, and dried againe, you must pound the figgs and wallnuts in a stone morter severally by themselves very small, all the rest must be made in fine pow|der, and so mix them altogether in the morter, and then add thereto sirrup by little and little, and so incorporate them al|together: you may give this in the same quantity, and in like sort as the other before. 7 Another very good.

Also, so much Triacle of Andromachus description eaten every morning as a bean, with a little conserve of Roses, is a very excellent good preservative. Valetius doth greatly commend the taking of three or four grains of the Bezar stone every morning, in a spoonfull of Sca|bios water. I cannot here sufficiently commend the Electuarie called Dioscordium, which is not onely good to resist the infection, but doth also expell the venemous matter of those which are infected, being taken every morning and evening the quan|tity of a bean, and drinke a draught of Rennish or White wine after it in winter season, but in Summer a draught of Beer or Ale is best. In strong and rusticall bodies, and such as are dayly labou|rers, Garlick onely eaten in the morning with some Butter and Salt at breakfast, drinking a cup of beer or ale after it, hath been found to be very good, which is greatly commen|ded by Galen, who calleth it the poor mans Triacle, but in the sanguine, daintie, and idle bodies it may not be used, because it over-heateth the bloud, causeth head-ach, and uni|versally inflameth the whole body.

CHAP. VIII. I Must here give you to understand that the infection doth oftentimes lie hidden within us, without any manifest sign or knowledge thereof at the first, and therefore were it good for sanguine bodies, and such as do abound with bloud, in the 13 summer season to draw six or eight ounces of bloud out of the Basilica vein in the right arme, which is a good meanes to prevent a further danger, (as Avicen witnesseth) but for full and plethorick bodies, it were best to purge themselves once in seven or eight daies with some easie and gentle purgation, as hereafter I will shew you: but for leane and spare bodies, once in fourteen dayes will be enough at most: for wisely saith Ron|doletius, that it is not onely the venemous and contagious ayre which we receive that doth kill us, but it is the present commu|nicating of that contagion with some superfluous humours in our bodies, as in his treatise De Peste appeareth: therfore now will I shew you how to purge the body.

Issues commended against the Plague. IN plethorick and full bodies, I have found nothing more safer in the time of the Plague, then to make them an artifi|ciall 15 Issue, either in the leg or arm, for never hitherto have I known any one which hath had an Issue, or Ulcer running on him that hath been infected with the plague. Palmarius and Forestus, doe both affirm it to be true and certain, but here some ignorant people doe hold opinion that having once an Issue, he must be constrained to keep it alwaies, which is most erronious, for then those which have had Ulcers running upon them, some six, ten, yea sixteen yeers, may not be cured with|out some Issue to be made in some other place, but therein they deceive themselves, for my self by good proof have of|ten found the contrary in divers people which I have cured, some six, some ten, yea sixteen yeers past, and yet to this day doe remain in perfect good health without any Issues. CHAP. IX. What Diet we ought to keep. FOr our diet as Hippocrates teacheth us, we must have a care not to exceed in eating and drinking but to keep a mean therein, and in any case to beware of surfeting and drunkenness, which are enemies both to the body and soule, but as we may not exceed in eating and drinking, so to en|dure great hunger and thirst is most dangerous, our meat ought to be of a facile and easie digestion, partly tending to a drying qualitie; as Cocks, Capons, Hens, Pullets, Par|tridge, Pheasants, Quailes, Pigeons, Rabbets, Kid, Veal, Mut|ton, Birds of the Mountains, and such like; but Beef, Pork, Venison, Hare and Goats flesh is to be refused, and so are all water fowls, as Duck, Swan, Goose, Widgen, Teal, and such like, because they are hard to digest, and do increase ill blood, and naughtie juyce in the bodie: Lambs flesh, because of his exceeding moisture is also to be refused, Eggs in the Summer not good, but in Winter tolerable: All Fishes which are of a hard flesh, whether they be of the Sea, or fresh Ri|vers are to be allowed. In fresh Rivers the Perch, Barble, Gudgeon, Loch, Cool, Trout, and Pike are good; and for Sea fish, the Gilthed, Turbet, Sole, Rochet, Gurnard, Lobster, Crab, Praunes, Shrimps, Whiting, and such like eaten with vi|negar. 16 There are some Authors which hold opinion, that Fish is better to be eaten then flesh in the great fervent heat of the year, because they doe make a more cold bloud in the body then flesh; another reason is, because they doe live under the water, they are not infected with any contagi|on of the aire, as Beasts and birds may be, and therefore more wholsome, but in my judgement flesh is more wholsome, be|cause it doth-breed a more pure, and fine Juyce in the body then any Fish whatsoever; your bread ought to be made of pure wheat, not too new, nor too"},{"pageNumber":398,"pageContent":"old, but of one dayes ba|king, or two at most is best: Rie bread is to be eschewed, be|cause of his great moisture: your drink is best beer or ale, not too strong or new, but the staler and clearer it is the better, at your meals a draught or two of Claret wine is to|lerable, but in hot weather it were good to allay it with a lit|tle water, for wine doth warm the stomack, help digestion, and comfort the heart. For your Pottage you may take in the Summer. Parsly, Lettice, Sorrell, Endive, Succorie, Sperage, Hop-buds, Burnet, Burrage, Buglosse, Thime, Mints, Hysop, but in Winter, Balm, Bittanie, Thime, Marigold, Hysop, Majoram, Mints and Rue are good. For your Sallets take Pimpernell, Purslane, Mints, Sorrell, Hore-hound, Yong cole, Hop-buds, Sperage, Thime, Tops of Fennell, Tarregon, Lettice, and Wa|ter-cresses are good. Capers are greatly commended being preserved in Vinegar, and eaten with a little oyle and vinegar, and so are Olives very good also. For your sauce, the juyce of a Limon, Citron, or Orange is best, the juyce of Sorrell and Vinegar is also good. All raw fruits are to be refused, except those which tend to sour tast, as Pomgranates, damask Prunes, Pippins, red and sour Cherries, and Wallnuts, Quinces, and Peares preserved are very good eaten after meals. All kind of Pulse is to be refused, as Beans, Pease, and such like, because they increase winde, and make raw humours and ill juyce in the bodie. 17 Refrain from Garlick, Onyons, Leeks, Pepper, Mustard, and Rocket, because they doe over-heat the body, make adustion of the bloud, and cause fumes to ascend into the head. Cheese is not good, because it doth ingender grosse and thick humors. Milk is also to be refused, because it doth quick|ly corrupt in the stomack. CHAP. X. Sheweth what Exercise and Order is to be kept. YOu must beware of all vehement and immoderate exer|cise, which doth provoke sweat, as is Tennis, dancing, leaping, running, foot-ball, hurling, and such like, because they doe over-much heat the body, and open the Pores of re|spiration, whereby the infected aire hath the more scope to enter our bodies, but moderate exercise is very convenient, the use of hot houses at this time I thinke very dangerous, because it doth too much open the pores."},{"pageNumber":399,"pageContent":"Walk not into the open ayre in the morning before the Sun hath had some power to cleanse and clear the same, and in any case goe not abroad when great fogs and mists are upon the earth, for it is dangerous: but if urgent occasions move you, then before you goe forth of your doors be sure to eat some preservative first, and then take some good and odoriferous Pomander, Nodule, or Nosegay in your hand, as before is shewed you. The extream heat of the day is like|wise to be refused to walk in, because it chafeth the bloud; as also in the evening after the Sun is set, for then unsavory and unwholsome Fogs arise out of the earth, and in any case if you can avoid it come not neer any any place infect|ed, but use to walk in the open aire and dry ground. Use Venus combates moderately, but none at all were bet|ter, the best time to use them is three or four hours after sup|per, before you sleep, and then rest upon them. Beware of anger, fear, and pensiveness of the minde, for by their means the body is made more apt to receive the in|fection. Use pleasant and merry recreations, either with musick, 18 pleasant company to talke withall, or reading some good books. Bewar of sleeping at noon, but specially in the Winter sea|son, but in Summer to take after dinner a nap of half an hour or an hour is tollerable in elderly bodies. Watch not long in the evenings but two or three hours after supper is a good time to take your rest. CHAP. XI. Teacheth what orders Magistrates, and Rulers of Cities and Townes, should cause to be observed, FIrst, To command that no stinking dunghills be suffered near the City. Secondly, Every evening and morning in hot weather to cause cold water to be cast in the streets, especially where the infection is, and every day to cause the streets to be kept clean and sweet, and cleansed from all filthy things which lye in the same. Thirdly, And whereas the infection is entered, there to cause fires to be made in the streets every morning and evening, and if some Frankincense, Pitch, or some other sweet thing be burnt therein, it will be much the better. Fourthly, Suffer not any Doggs, Catts, or Pigs to run about the streets, for they are very dangerous, and apt to carry the infection from place to place. Fifthly, Command that the excrements and filthy things which are voided from the infected places be not cast into the streets or rivers which are daily in use to make drink, or dresse meat."},{"pageNumber":400,"pageContent":"Sixtly, That no Chirurgians, or Barbars which use to let bloud, do cast the same into the streets or rivers. Seventhly, That no Vauts or Privies be then emptied, for it is a most dangerous thing. Eighthly, That all Inholders do every day make clean their stables, and cause the dung and fi[...]th therein to be carried away out of the City: for by suffering it in their houses, as some do use to do, a whole week or a fortnight, it doth so putrifie that 19 when it is removed, there is such a stinking and unwholsome smell, as is able to infect the whole street where it is. Ninthly, To command that no Hemp or Flax be kept in wa+ter near the City or Town, for that will cause a very dange|rous and infectious savour. Tenthly to have a speciall care, that good and wholsome Victuals and Corn be sold in the markets, and so to provide, that no want thereof be in the City, and for such as have not wherewithall to buy necessary food, that there to extend their charitable and godly devotion: for there is nothing that will more increase the Plague, then want and scarsity of neces|sary food. Eleventhly, To command that all those which do visite and attend the sick, as also all those which have the sicknesse on them, and do walk abroad, that they do carry something in their hands, thereby to be known from other people. And here I must advertise you of one thing more which I had almost for|gotten (which is) that when the infection is but in few places, there to keep the people in their houses, not suffering any one of them to go abroad, and so to provide, that all such necessaries as they shall need may be brought unto them during the time of their visitation: and when it is staied, then to cause all the clothes, bedding, and other such things as were used about the sick, to be all burnt, although at the charge of the rest of the Inhabitants you buy them all new, for fear least the danger which may ensue thereby, do put you to a far greater charge and grief: all these aforesaid things are most dangerous, and may cause a generall infection, to the destroying of a whole City, and therefore I do wish that great care be had thereof. CHAP. XII. Doth shew what you must do when you go to visit the sick. FIrst before you enter into the house, command that a great fire be made in the chamber where the sick lieth, and that some odoriferous perfume be burnt in the midest of the cham|ber, and before you go to him, eat some cordiall preservative, and smother your clothes with some sweet perfume, then wet 20 your temples, eares, nose, and mouth, with Rose-water and Vi|negar mixt together, then take in your mouth a peice of the root of Angelica, the rind of a sower Citron, or a Clove pre|pared as before is shewed, and have some Nosegay, Nodule, or Pomander, appropriate in your hand, which you must al|waies smell unto, so may you the more bouldlier perform your intent: but herewithall you must have a speciall care, that du|ring the time you are with the sick, you stand not betwixt the sick body and the fire, for that is dangerous; because that the fire of his nature draweth all vapors unto it self; but keep you alwaies on the contrary side, so that the sick"},{"pageNumber":401,"pageContent":"may be betwixt you and the fire: and for such as are to let any sick infected bo|dy to bleed, it were good they did cause the keeper of the sick body to lay open that arme or legg which is to be let bloud be|fore he approach near: the reason is, for that most commonly all that are sick in this contagious disease, are for the most part in a sweat, and therefore suddenly to receive the breath there|of, would be very dangerous. Now when you have been with any one so infected, before you go into the company of any whole and sound people, it were necessary you do stand by a good fire, having all the clothes about you which you did wear when you were with the sick, and then turn and aire your selfe well thereby, so shall you be sure the lesse to endanger others by your company. Thus have I as breefly as I can devise set down all the ordinary meanes which my self have used, and by others known to be used for preserving you from this contagious and dangerous disease, which in the most part of people will suffice, but for such as dwell whereas they may have the counsell of a learned Physitian, I do wish them to take his advice, especially for purging and letting bloud, because none can so exactly set down in writing the perfect course thereof (which may be un|derstood rightly of the common sort) so well as he which hath the sight of the body: for that many bodies are oftentimes troubled with some one humour abounding more then another, which here to treat of would be too tedious, neither can it profit the common people, for whose sakes I have taken this paines: and now will I shew the signes to know when one is 21 infected therewith, as also which are the laudable signes, and which are the contrary, and lastly the meanes (by God his as|sistance) how for to cure the same. CHAP. XIII. Sheweth the signes of infection. THe signes and tokens hereof are divers, as first, it is percei|ved by the suddain weaknesse, loosing and overthrowing of our naturall strength, without any manifest cause thereof going before, and sometimes it doth begin with a gnawing and biting in the mouth of the stomack, the pulse will grow weak, feeble, and unequall, with a great streightnesse and heavinesse about the heart, as if some heavie burthen or weight were layd thereon, with shortness of breathing, vomiting, or at least a great desire to vomit, great pain in the head: insatiable thirst proceed|ing of their great interior heat: sluggishnes, and universal faint|ness of all the body, with a great desire to sleep, and an astonish|ment of the mind and vitall spirits: and for the most part they complain of a great paine which is felt in some one place or places of their bodies, where the botch or blain is by nature in|tended to be thrust forth, yet some at the first have them ap|pearing: and for the most part, they are taken at the first with a sharp and rigorous feaver. Good signes. When the botch or Carbunkle cometh out in the beginning of the sicknesse with a red colour, and yellowish round about it, and that it doth quickly come to maturation, the feaver to cease, and the"},{"pageNumber":402,"pageContent":"party findeth himself eased of his grief, and quickned in his spirits, these are good and laudable signes of recovery. Evill signes. When the botch at the first commeth out blackish, or black in colour, also when the botch is opened, the flesh within doth look blew, and that then there appear not any matter or quit|ture 22 in the wound, but as it were a spume or froth issuing out thereof, are ill and deadly signes, When the botch waxeth so hard that by no means it will come to suppuration, but resisteth whatsoever is done unto it for the furthering thereof, and so returneth in againe into the inward parts suddenly, is a token of sudden death at hand, and so it is if either before or after it is broken it look of a blewish colour, or of divers colours, like the Rainbow, round about it. When the Carbunckle or Blain doth suddenly dry up, as if it were scorcht with the fire, and that the place round about it doth shew to be of a wannish blew colour, is a deadly sign: if in the skin appear green or black spots, the excrements of divers colours with worms in it either dead or living, having a vile stinking savour, and spitteth stinking and bloudy matter, doth betoken death. When the sick complaines of great and extream heat in the inward parts, and yet cold outwardly, the eyes staring or weep|ing the face terrible, the said excrements or urin passing away, and the party not knowing thereof, are evill signes. When in the fourth or seventh day they are taken with a fren|sie, or do fall into an extream bleeding at nose, or have a great flux with a continuall vomiting, or a desire to vomit and do it not, extream pain at the heart, watchfullness, and the strength clean gone, are deadly signes. When the party being very sick, yet saith he feeleth himself well, his eyes sunk deep in his head, and full of tears, when he thinks all things do stink, his nailes looking blew, the nose sharp, and as it were crooked, the breath thick and short with a cold sweat in the brest and face, and turning and playing with the clothes, the pulse creeping or scarcely to be felt, and greivous unto him to speak, these are infallible signes of death at hand. Some, before any of these signes are perceived, do dy, and some likewise which have di|vers of them appearing, and yet do escape, such is the uncer|tainty of this disease: there are many other symptoms which do happen in this contagious disease, which would be too tedi|ous to declare, but these as the chiefest may suffice. The end of the first Treatise. 23"},{"pageNumber":403,"pageContent":"The Second Treatise, shewing the meanes how to cure the Plague. CHAP. I. VVHen we perceive any to be infected with this contagi|ous disease, we must with all possible speed seek all the meanes we can how to prevent the malignity thereof, whose property is at the first to assault the principall part, which is the heart, and therefore requires present help; for unlesse some|thing be done within eight or four and twenty houres, little will it then prevail to attempt it, for by that time nature is either subdued, and clean overthrown, or else hath thrust the same to the exterior parts, or otherwise digested it: yet may we not neglect at any time, to use all the meanes we can, in helping and furthering of nature to the uttermost of our in|deavour, because we doe oftentimes see nature so wearied, and weakened in expelling of this venemous matter, that unlesse some help be added to assist and comfort her, the party, for lack thereof, dyeth, which otherwise might be saved: For I have oftentimes seen by diligent helping of nature, that to be effect|ed and brought to good passe, which I have judged most despe|rate. There are foure intentions required for the curing there|of; that is, by bloud-letting, Cordials, sweat and purging: but the manner how to execute the same, hath bred great conten|tion both amongst the old and later Writers, which here to treat of were too tedious, for unto the learned it were need|lesse, and for the commonalty little would it availe them, therefore in breif will I shew you what I have observed touching the cure. First, if it be in a Plethorick, sanguine, and strong body, and hath pain in the head, great heat at the heart, thirstnesse, the pulse strong, and labouring, or beating strongly, and hath great and large veines appearing; these ought presently to be let bloud in that side where yee perceive the greif doth prof|fer 24 it selfe to come forth, and not visibly appearing, tending to maturation: For then we may not draw bloud, but use all other meanes we can devise, in helping nature to expell it, neither may you draw bloud, if the party have a flix or lask (which is an evill sign) in the beginning of the disease, for by that meanes you shall hinder nature greatly, but onely give the party Cordials; neither may you stop the flix in the be|ginning, but if it be extream, and that it stay not the second day, then must you give some purgation, which may leave an astringency behind it, as hereafter in the cure of the flix shall be shewed. For as Hyppocrates, in his first book and one and twentieth Aphorisme, doth admonish us, we must consider and mark, how nature doth incline her self, for that will teach us what we are to doe. Now if you perceive the botch or carbunkle to appear un|derneath the chin about the throat, then presently draw bloud in both veines under the tongue, and immediately after that apply a cupping glasse; with scarification in one side of the neck next unto the fore, thereby to draw it from the throat, for fear least suddenly it choke him up, and then apply Chickens rumps, or Hens rumps to the botch, the feathers being first pluckt away from the rump, and a grain of Salt put into the tewell, and so hold the bare place to the greif untill the Chicken die, which will be within half an hour, and then apply another, and so continue in changing them so long as they doe die, and lastly apply a mollificative Cataplasme or plaister to the same place, as in the fift Chapter following is shewed, which is made with Unguentum basillicon, and to the botch ap|ply the Epithemation and Cataplasme in the seventh Chapter following. But if it be in the neck, he doth"},{"pageNumber":404,"pageContent":"complain, then let him bloud in the Cephallica vein in the arm, of the same side where he complaineth. If in the groin or flanke he doth complain, then let him bloud in the foot on the same side, and open the vein called Maleola, or Saphena, the quantity must be according as the age and strength of the party requireth, but at most draw not above six or eight ounces: For Avicen willeth us, to preserve bloud as the treasure of nature. 25 But in a weak, spare, and cachochimious body (as Galen teacheth us) we may not draw bloud at all, for thereby should you greatly indanger the Patient, but help such by Cordials and sweat. And here you shall understand, that unlesse Phlebotomy be done at the first, that is, within six or eight houres at most, it will be too late to attempt it, neither may you doe it if the sore doe appear up in height tending to suppuration, for then should you hinder nature, which like a diligent workman, hath discharged and thrust forth that venomous matter, which o|therwise would have killed us. And here touching Phlebotomy or bloud-letting, you must have this speciall care, that you draw not bloud on the opposite side, as if it be on the left side the sore appear, then draw not bloud on the right side; if it appear in the flanke, then draw not bloud in the arme, but in the foot, for other|wise you shall draw that venomous matter from the ignoble unto the noble parts, and so kill the body. And although the party complain not more in the one side then the other, yet by the pulse shall you perceive on which side the venome lieth hidden, for on that side where nature is opprest, there shall you find the pulse more weak, feeble, and uneven, greatly differing from the other side. And here you shall understand, that in some it hath been seen, that nature of it self at the first, hath thrust out that ve|nomous matter in some place of the body, with a botch ap|pearing high, and tending to suppuration, or a carbunckle, or spots called purples. Now here if you draw bloud, you doe then greatly indanger the body; but in this case you must one|ly give Cordials, and use all the meanes you can to bring it outward, either by maturation, or evaporation, as hereafter shall be shewed you. And here you shall further understand, that where the age, constitution, nor strength of the party will permit that Phle|botomy be done, yet for the better help of nature you must apply Ventoses, with reasonable deep scarification, unto the next place adjoyning, where the party complaineth, thereby the more speedily to draw the venomous matter unto the su|perficiall 26 parts, and there to apply the rumps of Chickens, as before is taught you, and so apply to the place some strong maturative, and atrractive plaister, or Cataplasme, as hereafter shall be shewed you. If the greif be in the head or throte, then apply Ventoses to the neck: If it be in the emunctuaries of the heart, then apply them to the shoulders: If in the e|munctuaries of the liver, then apply them to the buttocks or thighs, now when this is done, either by Phlebetomy, or Ven|toses, then within an hour or two at the most after it, you must give the sick some good Cordiall Medicine, which hath"},{"pageNumber":405,"pageContent":"power to comfort the heart, resist the venomous matter, and also procure sweat, whereof out of the following you may make choice as you list.

FIrst you must consider, that oftentimes the botch, or carbun|kle doth offer it selfe to come forth in some place of the body, and yet no apparant sign thereof, but lieth deep hidden within, because nature is not of sufficient strength to thrust it forth; which is easily perceived by the great and almost intolerable pain, that by some is felt in the place where nature intends to expell it, which in the most part of people, by bloud-letting, Cordials, and sweat, is clean taken away and evacuated; but if after all this is done it goe not away, then unto these you must use all the meanes you can to bring it to the outward parts. First, by giving to the sick oftentimes some Cordiall Electuary to keep it from the heart, then (if no great pain be in the outward part) you must apply a cupping-glasse with scarification, directly against the place where the greif is felt, and let it remain thereon a quar|ter or halfe an hour, then take it away, and presently apply the rumps of Chickens, Hens, or Pigeons to the place (as before hath been shewed) that being done, then lay some attractive and maturative plaister or Cataplasme to the place, which here fol|lowing is shewed, and every sixth hour you must apply the cup|ping-glass, as also the rest, untill such time as you have brought the venomous matter to the outward parts, there to be visibly seen, or at least, by feeling to be perceived, which commonly is effected at the second time, then use no more cupping, but onely apply a maturative to the place.

THe Carbunkle or blain doth first begin with a little Pustula or wheal, and sometime with divers Pustulaes or wheales to|gether, with a great burning and pricking pain in the place, which Pustulaes are like a scalding bladder, seeming to be full of water or matter, yet when you open it, little or nothing will come out of it, and when they are broken, will grow to a hard crust or scarre, as if it had been burnt with a hot Iron or Caustick, with a great ponderosity or heavinesse in the place. In some it comes in the beginning, without any Pustula at all to be perceived, but with a hard black crust or a scarre; sometimes it lyeth hidden in the inward parts without any outward appearance at all, as if it be in the lungs, then there is a difficulty of breathing, with a Cough and soul spitting. If it be in the Liver or Spleen, then the party feeleth a great pain and pricking in the same side; if in the Kidneyes or Bladder it doth chance, then is there suppression or stopping of the Urine, or great pain in the making of water; if it be in the Brain, then a delirium followeth, but howsoever it chance to come, the party infected therewith hath a Fever, with other accidents, as before in the 13. Chapter of the first Treatise is declared; if it begin with a green, black, or blew colour, or of divers colours like the Rain|bow, then is it a deadly signe, and so is it, if once it appear and then suddenly vanish away; but if it be red or yellowish, so it be not in any of the principall parts, or emunctuaries of the body, as the heart, stomack, armpit, flanke, jawes, or throat, then it is laudable, otherwise in any of these places very desperate and dangerous to be cured, but wheresoever it doth chance, unlesse it may be brought to suppuration, it is deadly. 47 The cure of the Carbunkle.

The End of the Second Treatise. A Short Treatise of the Small Pox, shewing the Means how for to govern and cure those which are infected therewith. CHAP. I. Sheweth what the Small Pox and Measels are, and whereof it proceedeth. FOr that oftentimes those that are infected with the Plague, are in the end of the disease sometime troubled with the small Pox or Measels, as also by good observation it hath been seen, that they are fore-runners or warnings of the plague to come, as Salius and divers other writers doe testifie: I have thought it good and as a matter pertinent to my for|mer Treatise, to shew the aids and helps which are required for the same. I need not greatly to stand upon the description of this disease, because it is a thing well known unto most people, pro|ceeding of adusted bloud mixt with flegm, as Avicen witnes|seth, which according to both ancient and latter Writers doth alwaies begin with a Fever, then shortly after there ariseth small Pustulaes upon the skin throughout all the body, which doe not suddenly come forth, but by intermission, in some more or lesse, according to the state and qualitie of the bodie in|fected therewith: for in some there ariseth many little Pustulaes with elevation of the skin, which in one day doe increase and grow bigger, and after have a thick matter growing in them, which the Greeks call Exanthemata or Exthymata: and after the Latines Variola, in our English tongue the small Pox, 51 and here some Writers doe make a difference betwixt vari|ola and exanthemata; for say they, that is called variola when many of those Pustules doe suddenly run into a clear bladder, as if it had been scalled, but the other doth not so, yet they are both one in the cure, they doe most commonly appear the fourth day, or before the eight day, as Avicen witnesseth. "},{"pageNumber":426,"pageContent":"What the Measels or Males are. Avicen saith, That the Measels or Males is that which first cometh with a great swelling in the flesh, with many little Pim|ples which are not to be seen, but onely by feeling with the hand are to be perceived, they have little elevation of the skin, neither doe they grow to maturation, or end with ul|ceration as the Pox doth, neither doe they assault the eyes, or leave any deformity behind them as the Pox doth, neither are they so swift in coming forth, but doe grow more slowly, they require the same cure which the Pox have, they proceed of cholerick and melancholie bloud. The cause of the Pox and Measels. The primitive cause as Valetius saith, is by alteration of the aire, in drawing some putrified and corrupt quality unto it, which doth cause an ebullition of our bloud. The cause antecedent is repletion of meats, which do easily corrupt in the stomack, as when we eat milk and fish toge|ther at one time, or by neglecting to draw bloud, in such as have accustomed to doe it every year, whereby the bloud doth abound. The conjunct cause is the menstruall bloud, which from the beginning in our mothers wombs wee received, the which mixing it self with the rest of our bloud, doth cause an Ebul|lition of the whole. The efficient cause is, nature or naturall heat, which by that menstruall matter mixing it self with the rest of our blouds doth cause a continuall vexing and disquieting thereof, where|by an unnaturall heat is increased in all the body, causing an Ebullition of bloud, by the which this filthy menstrual mat|ter 52 is seperated from our natural bloud, and the nature being of|fended and overwhelmed therewith, doth thrust it to the out|ward pores of the skin as the excrements of bloud, which mat|ter if it be hot and slimie, then it produceth the Pox, but if dry and subtil, then the Measels or Males. But Mercurialis an excellent writer in Physick, in his first Book, de morbis puero|rum, cap. 2. agreeing with Fernelius in his Book De abdit is rerum causis, c. 12. doth hold opinion, that the immediate cause of this disease doth not proceed of menstrual bloud, but of some secret and unknown corruption, or defiled quality of the aire, causing an Ebullition of bloud, which is also verified by Valetius, and now doth reckon it to be one of the hereditable diseases, be|cause few or none doe escape it, but that either in their youth, ripe age, or old age, they are infected therewith. The contention hereabout is great, and mighty reasons are op|pugned on both sides, therefore I will leave the judgement thereof unto the better learned to define; but mine opinion is, That now it proceedeth of the Excrements of all the four humours in our bodies, which striving with the purest, doth cause a supernatural heat and ebullition of our bloud, al|waies beginning with a Fever in the most part, and may well be reckoned in the number of those diseases which are cal|led Epidemia: as Fracastorius in his first Book, De morbis contag. cap. 13. witnesseth this disease is very contagious and infectious, as experience teacheth us: There are two speciall causes why this disease is infectious: The first is, be cause it pro|ceedeth by ebullition of bloud, whose vapour being entred into another bodie, doth soon defile and infect"},{"pageNumber":427,"pageContent":"the same, the second reason is, because it is a disease hereditable; for we see when one is infected therewith, that so many as come neer him, (especially those which are allyed in the same bloud) doe assuredly for the most part, receive the infection also. CHAP. II. Sheweth to know the signs when one is infected, as also the good and ill signs in the disease. THe signs when one is infected are these, first he is taken with a hot Fever, and sometime with a Delirium, great 53 pain in the back, furring and stopping of the nose, beating of the heart, hoarsnesse, redness of the eyes, and full of tears with heavinesse and pain in the head, great beating in the fore|head and temples, heaviness and pricking in all the body, dry|ness in the mouth, the face very red, pain in the throat and breast, difficulty in breathing, and shaking of the hands and feet with spitting thick matter. When they doe soon or in short time appear, and that in their coming out they doe look red, and that after they are come forth they doe look white, and speedily grow to matu|ration, that he draweth his breath easily, and doth find him|self eased of his pain, and that his Fever doth leave him, these are good and laudable signes of recovery. When the Pox lye hidden within and not appearing out|wardly, or if after they are come forth they doe suddenly strike in again and vanish away, or that they doe look of a black, blewish, and green colour, with a difficultie and strait|nesse of drawing breath, and that he doe often swoun, if the sick have a flix or lask, when the Pox were found double, that is, one growing within another, or when they run together in blisters like scalding bladders, and then on the sudden do sink down and grow dry with a hard black scar or crust, as if it had been burnt with a hot iron, all these are ill signs. Avicen saith, there are two speciall causes which produce death unto those that have this disease: either for that they are choaked with great Inflammation and swelling in the throat called Angina, or having a flix or lask which doth so weaken and overthrow the vitall spirits, that thereby the disease is increased, and so death followeth. How to know of what humours this disease cometh. If it come of bloud, then they appear red, with generall pain, and great heat in all the body. If they come of choler, then will they appear of a yellowish red and clear colour, with a pricking pain in all the bodie."},{"pageNumber":428,"pageContent":"If they come of flegm, then will they appear of a whitish colour and scaly, or with scales. 54 If they come of melancholie, then will they appear black|ish with a pricking pain. CHAP. III. Sheweth the meanes to cure the Pox or Measels. THere are two speciall meanes required for curing this dis|ease, the first is to help nature to expell the same from the interior and principall parts unto the exterior: the second is to preserve both the interior and exterior parts, that they may not be hurt thereby. For the first intention, if the age and strength of the sick will permit, and that the Pox or Measels appear not, it were then good in the first, second, or third day to draw bloud out of the Basilica veine in the right arme, if he be not under the age of fourteen years, but the quantity must be at the discreti|on of him that draweth it, either more or lesse as occasion is offered: but for children and such as are of tender years, and weak bodies, it were not good to draw bloud out of the arme, but out of the inferior parts, as the thighes, hams buttocks, and the Emeroidall veines, especially if the party be melan|cholie, or else to apply ventose; to the loynes, buttocks, or hams, which may boldly be used both before and after they do appear, either with scarification, or without, as cause requi|reth, which is a speciall good meanes to draw that Ichorous matter from the interior to the exterior parts; but for sucking Children, it were best to apply bloud-suckers unto any of the foresaid places, which is a thing that may be used with more ease then ventoses, neither do I wish either of them to be used un|lesse necessity require it, which is, when the matter lieth lurk|ing in the interior parts, not offering it self to appear out|wardly: otherwise I hold it better to leave the whole work un|to nature, specially in sucking children: for when we see that nature is ready, or doth endeavour to expell the malignity which is in the interior parts to the exterior, which may be per|ceived by reviving of the Spirits, and mitigating of the Fever: here we ought not to use any meanes at all, but leave the whole operation to nature, which we must onely help by keeping 55 the sick body in a reasonable heat, being wrapt in a scarlet, stammell, or red cloth, which may not touch the skin, but to have a soft linnen cloth betwixt them both, and then cover him with clothes in reasonable sort, and keep him from the open ayre and the light, except a little, and also from anger, using all the meanes you can to keep the sick in quietnesse, and if the body be very costive, then to give an easie Glister. A Glister. Rx. Barley, two handfuls, Violet leaves one handfull: Boyle these in three pints of water untill half be consumed, and strein it: then take of the same decoction twelve ounces.

FINIS. 97"},{"pageNumber":438,"pageContent":"Some other few additionall observations concerning the passages in this latter Treatise. PAge the eighth of this precedent Book, a Quilt or Bag is commended to be very excellent; it is reported to be Pope Adrians Bag, which he used against infection, and in the great last Sicknesse in London, it was commended to many great Persons of worth by some Apothecaries, who kept it as a great secret, and affirmed, it would prevent infection, and pre|serve them safe in that dangerous time; and thereupon sold it unto them at a very great rate: But that you may not be deluded in the prescription, I have set down the true receit thereof, as it was delivered unto me from the hands of a very noble friend. A Preservative against the infection of the air, and the Plague, often approved by Pope Adrian, and many others of great rank and credit. Take Arsenick two ounces, Auripigmentum one ounce, make little tablets thereof with the whites of Eggs, and Gum Dr[...]|gacanth, and hang them about the neck against the heart. I have also set down a red Cordiall water, very good against in|fection, which I had also from that noble friend. Take a quart of good spirit of Wine, or very good Aqua vitae, infuse it in one ounce of good Mithridate, with as much good Venice Triacle: let it be close stopped some few dayes 98 in the infusion before you use it, then pour the spirit clear off, and reserve it for your use. But to discover what opinions other Phisitians have held of that and the like, I have annexed hereunto their severall judgements hereafter, that amongst so many choise Medi|cines, they may select out the best and safest for their own preservations, when need shall require. And to give them the better satisfaction, I have annexed, out of some choise Manuscripts, some approved Experiments, of some of our London ablest Doctors, as also out of some other Authors. Severall opinions against wearing of Arsenick Amulets, as Preservatives against the Plague. THe poysonous vapours of Arsenick being sucked or drawn into the body, when they find no contrary poyson with whom to wrestle with, as with an enemy, (for in an infected body there cannot be health; but we suppose him to be well, whom we desire to preserve so) those vapours"},{"pageNumber":439,"pageContent":"must needs imprint a malignant and venomous quality on the spirit and heart, most adverse and pernitious to nature. And by Galens own doctrine, all Alexiteries doe in a man|ner, if they be used too liberally, greatly offend and weaken our bodies; how can we then think, that ranke Poysons and Dilaetories, (such us Arsenick is) being applied, as to pene|trate into the noblest region of all other, will no whit violate and wast our naturall, vitall, and radicall heat? Galen libr. de [...]mp. cap. 18. Nor did Galen, or any of the antient Fathers and Professors of Physick, use to preserve from the Plague, or any other poison, by administring some other poison inwardly, or 99 prescribing outwardly Applications, but proceeded by An|tidotes, and Alexiteries, as will appear in libr. de Theriaca ad Pis. cap, 16. Wherefore, unlesse we will utterly disclaim or relinguish the method and prescripts of these worthy An|tients, and prosecute new wayes and inventions, to oppose this man-yelling Monster, we must attempt it not with Poysons but Antidotes. And Galen defineth those to be Poysons, which agree not with nature, either well or ill affected at any time; for though there are some Poysons, which if they meet in the body with a contrary venome, so fight with it, and oppose it, that both doe perish in the conflict betwixt them; so that the party, by their colluctation and strugling together, escapes with his life: yet all of them agree in uniform opinion to|gether, that where they meet with no opposition, they ruine the party: And therefore conclude, that Arsenick, worn by a healthy man, finding not onely no contrary Poyson to make conflict with, but no Poyson at all, must necessarily thwart, and oppose, and make an onset on nature her self. And to confirme their opinions, I have purposely intro|duced the judgements of other learned Phisitians concurring with them. Gerardus Columbus, a learned Phisitian, reporteth, that it hath been observed, that the wearers of these Amulets, upon unusuall heating their bodies, have fallen into sudden Lipothi|mies, and Swounings, with other fearfull accidents, which continued upon them till the Amulets or Placents were re|moved from them; and that others, though not instantly, yet after some time, have by late and wofull experience disco|vered their malignity, by falling into malignant and pestilent Fevers, some of them ending with death. Franc. Alphanus, a Phisitian of Salerne, relateth of one, who wearing Arsenick, and heating himself with playing earnestly at Tennise, fell down suddenly dead. Mattheus Hessus also thus writeth, As Cordiall Bags or Amulets ought not to be disavowed, so empoysoned Amulets can be no way commended; nor doe I remember, that ever any received good from them, who abstained from other 100 Antidotes: But this I certainly know, that divers persons, who carry about them Quick-silver in a Nutshell, by the vain perswasions of some Imposters, have died of the Plague, and the counsellours and advisers of such like Amulets, have been the first have betaken themselves to their heeles, confi|ding more in their running than cunning: and yet these Quacks perswaded the ignorant people, with glorious pro|mises and protestations, that whosoever carried Quick-silver or Arsenick about his neck, should be as safe, as if he had pur|chased a protection from the King of Heaven"},{"pageNumber":440,"pageContent":"Historians also report, that Caracalla, though he were a wicked Emperour, prohibited by publick Edict or Procla|mation, that no man should wear about him superstitious Amulets. And Theophrastus the great (not without cause) esteemed Pericles to have a crazed brain, because he saw him wear an Amulet about his neck. And hereunto Doctor Francis Herring, an able Phisitian, as a Corollary to what hath before been written, addeth the experience of some London Phisitians, who report, they have seen foul holes made in the breasts of those that have worn those Amulets, and have observed divers to die, who have religiously worn them about their necks, as well as others. And whereas the venters and setters out of these deceitfull wares, make them as a scout, to discover the infection when it beginneth to seize on a man, by clapping close to the heart, to guard that principall part, as the cheif Tower: It is a meer deceit and collusion: for whensoever the body is heated, this event followeth necessarily, though no other infection be near, but the poysonous and venomous Arsenick it self, whose salu|tation is rather Joabs imbracing, or Juda's kissing, than friendly preservatives. Causes of the Plague. There are two speciall causes of the Plague. First, An infected, corrupted, and putrified air, 101 Secondly, Evill and corrupt humours ingendered in the body. The air is infected, when the temperatenesse of the air is changed from his naturall state, to excessive heat and moisture, which is the worst temperament of the air, the vapours drawn up by the heat of the Sun being unconsumed, rot, putrifie, and corrupt, and so with the venome infect the air: Also dead Carkases lying unburied, as it often chanceth in Warres, evaporations of Pooles, Fens, Marishes, stinking and noysome sents and Kennels, and Astronomers say, Aspects, Conjuncti|ons and Oppositions of ill Planets, and Eclipses of the Sun and Moon. Also disordering ones self, either in diet or exercises bring|eth one into the Pestilence; therefore in time of contagion, outrages and surfets are to be avoided, as also all excesse of eat|ing, drinking, sweating, bathing, lechery, and all other things that open the pores of the body, and enter thereby ill aires, which invenome the lively spirits. Signes of the Plague. The signes which declare one infected already are many; but the secret token of all to know the infected of the Plague is, if there arise botches behind the eares, or under the arme|holes, or about"},{"pageNumber":441,"pageContent":"the share; or if Carbunkles suddenly arise in any member, for when they appear, they betoken strength of nature, which being strong, laboureth to drive the poyson out of the body; but if botches doe not appear, it is more dangerous, for it sheweth, that nature is weak and feeble, and not able to expell and thrust forth the venomous hu|mours, and then you must have respect to the signes before rehearsed. The infection of the Plague entereth into a man after this sort. In a man are three principall parts (that is) the Heart, Liver, and Brains, and each of these hath his cleansing place: 102 If they appear in the neck, they shew the Brains to be cheifly vexed, if under the arme-holes the Heart, but if they appear in the share, the Liver is most infected, For when a man hath taken infection, it presently mingleth with the bloud, and runs to the heart, which is the cheif part of man, and the heart putteth the venome to his cleansing place, which is the arme-holes; and that being stopt, putteth it to the next principall part, which is the liver, and it passeth it to his cleansing place, which is the share, and they being stopt, passe it to the next principall place, that is, the braines, and to their cleansing places, which are under the eares, or under the throat, and they being stopped, suffer it not to passe out, and then it is moved twelve hours before it rest in any place, and if it be not let out within the space of four and twen|ty hours by bleeding, it brings a man into a pestilentiall Ague, and causeth a botch in one of those three places, or near un|to them The Cure of the Plague. When thou feelest thy self infected, bleed in the first hour, or within six hours after, drink not, and tarry not above twelve hours from bleeding, for then when the bloud is flitting too and fro, the venome is then moving, and not yet setled, and after it will be too late; those that are fat may be let bloud, or else not. If the matter be gathered under the arme-holes, it comes from the heart by the Cardiacall vein, then bleed on the same side by the Basilica vein, the innermost vein of the arme, If the botch appear behind the eares, above the chin, or in any other part of the face or neck, bleed out of the Cephalica vein on the same side; you may bleed with cupping Glasses, and Scarification, or Horseleeches. If the botch appear in the share, bleed in the ankle on the same side, in any case not in the arme, for it will draw up the matter again."},{"pageNumber":442,"pageContent":"103 But if no botch appear outwardly, draw bloud out of that side where you feel greatest pain and heavinesse, and out of that vein, the greif of the members affected shall point thee out.

Take Zedoary roots the best you can get, great Raisins, and Licorice, champ it with thy teeth and swallow it, if you be in|fected it preserveth without danger. 104 Another for botches, boyls, and tokens. Take of ripe Ivy berries dryed in the shade, as much of the powder as will lye upon a groat or more, and put it into three or four ounces of white Wine, and lie in bed and sweat well; after your sweat is over, change shirt, and sheets, and all the bed clothes if he may, if not, yet change his shirt and sheets."},{"pageNumber":443,"pageContent":"Some have taken this powder over night, and found them|selves well in the morning, and walked about the house fully cured.

The Calenture, HAppeneth to our Nation in intemperate Climates, by Inflammation of bloud, and proceedeth often of immo|derate drinking of wine, and eating of pleasant fruits, which are such nourishers thereof, as they prevent the meanes used in curing the same. To know the Calenture. At the first apprehension it afflicts the Patient with great pain in the head, and heat in the body, which is continuall or increasing, and doth not diminish and angment, as other Fe|vers doe; and is oft an Introduction to the Taberdilla or Pe|stilence, but then the body will seem very yellow. To cure the Calenture. So soon as you perceive the Patient possest of the Calen|ture, (except the Chirurgion, for danger of the sign defer it) I have seen the time of the day not respected, open the Me|dian vein of the right arm, and take such quantity of bloud, as agreeth with the ability of the bodie; but if it asswage not the heat by the next day, open the same vein in the left arme, and take so much more like quantity of bloud at his discre|tion; and if the body be costive, (as commonly they are) give him some meet purgation, and suffer him to drink no o|ther then water cold, wherein Barley and Annise-seeds have been boyled with bruised Liquorice.

The Taberdilla,"},{"pageNumber":445,"pageContent":"IS a disease so called by the Spaniards, by the Mexicans, Co|calista, and by other Indians is named Taberdet, and is so exceeding pestilent and infectious, that whole Kingdomes in both the India's have been depopulated by it, for want of knowledge to redresse themselves of it. To know the Taberdilla. It first assaults the Patient vehemently with pain in the head and back: and the body seeming yellow, is some sign there|of, and within 24 hours it is so torturous, that the possest there|of cannot rest or sleep, turning himself on either side, back or belly, burning in his back most extreamly. And when it growes to perfection, there will appear red and blue spots upon the Patients breast and wrists. And such persons as have not presently requisite means applyed to them to prevent it, will be, by the vehement torment thereof, deprived of their wits, and many to cease their pain by losse of their lives have despairingly slain, and drowned themselves. The Cure of the Taberdilla. When you perceive it afflict the Patient, permit him not to lie very warm, nor upon feathers (for of what quality soever he bee in Spain, having this sickness he is laid upon wheat-straw:) Then immediatly open the Median Vein, first in one arm, and the next day in the other, taking a good quantity of bloud: Let him have water cold, wherein Barlie and An|nise-seeds have been sodden without Liquorice (for the Spa|nish 108 Physitians hold Liquorice to bee hurtfull unto them) so much as he will desire, which will be every moment; but no other drink, nor any raw fruits: Assoon as the spots appear, give him some Cordiall potion: and laying him upon his belly, set six Ventoses together on his back, between and be|neath the shoulders; and scarifying them, draw out (if it be a body of strong constitution) 18 ounces of bloud. After which, and that he hath slept, he will find ease within twenty four hours, and such alteration in himself, as he will thinke he is delivered of a most strange torment. Then give him moderately nourishing meats, (for he will desire to eat much) the fourth day, give him some convenient Purgations. And if in the mean while he is costive, provoke him every day by Clisters; and warn him to forbear 15 dayes all other drink then what is ordained: And be very carefull of his diet, for if this Taberdilla, which we call here in England Gods Tokens, come againe unto the Patient, he can hardly escape it.

The Party having it, will be giddie in the head, and have pain and pricking at his breast, as with many thornes; from whence I thinke it is called, for Espina in Spanish signifies a thorn; and there will be upon the Focell, being the upper bone of his arm, a hand breadth above the wrist, a little ker|nell by the which it is certainly known: He that hath this disease, will have appetite neither to meat, nor drinke, nor can digest meat, though he be invited and moved to take it. 109 To cure the Espinlas. The Espinlas appearing by the former signs, take presently oyle Olives, and therewith chase the kernell upon the Patients arm, using so to doe twice every day, untill it be dissolved; and laying oyle likewise upon his breast, stroke it upward somewhat hard with the hand; then spread fine flaxe upon it and the kernel, making it fast with a rowler, and within two or three dayes the diseased will be recovered thereof, where|as else it is very dangerous to deprive them of life.

For speedy and assured remedie, the Patients bodie must be clean|sed of the sliminess, ingendred in the passages of the nutri|ments, before any sustenance can remain in his bodie. To that purpose purge him in the morning, with halfe a pint of white wine cold, wherein half an ounce of Rubard being smal 110 cut hath been sodden, putting some Sugar Candie to it, to sweeten it, and immediatly after he hath so purged, keep at his navell Rosemary sod in strong Vinegar, applyed in the mor|ning and evening very hot, untill it be stayed; giving him often Quinces bruised, and rouled in Marmalade like Pills, which he should swallow whole, and none of the fruits or meats before recited, nor any more white wine, but red wine of any sort: And if it be one the land use the Livers of Goats, (especially) Sheeps, or Bullocks rosted; not willingly permit|ting the Patient to eat any other meat: And if at Sea, Rice onely sodden in water, rather then any thing else usuall there, untill the infirmitie bee perfectly asswaged.

To Cure the Erisipela. The Savage people first found out perfectly how to cure this disease, (though it is the Spanish name of the Maladie) by bruising so much Tobacco as will yeeld four spoonfuls of 111 juyce, and to drinke it presently after they are infected there|with, and to launce the places swollen, thereunto putting Ca|sade wet, and made into paste, continuing in cold and shadie places neer Rivers: and not to travell and labour till they bee recovered: The Spaniards in India doe recover them|selves by taking the same juyce of Tobacco, and setting so many Ventoses upon the swoln"},{"pageNumber":448,"pageContent":"places as they can contain, scarifying them, and drawing out the corrupted humour so congealed, using the like in two or three other parts of the bodie, where the disease doth not appeare.
