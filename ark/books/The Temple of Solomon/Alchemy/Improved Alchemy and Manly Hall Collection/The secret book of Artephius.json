Thissaturnine antimony agrees with sol, and contains in itself argent vive, in which no metal is swallowed up,except gold, and gold is truly swallowed up by this antimonial argent vive. Without this argent vive no metalwhatsoever can be whitened; it whitens laton, i.e. gold; reduceth a perfect body into its prima materia, or firstmatter, viz. into sulphur and argent vive, of a white color, and outshining a looking glass. It dissolves, I saythe perfect body, which is so in its own nature; for this water is friendly and agreeable with the metals,whitening sol, because it contains in itself white or pure argent vive. (2) And from both these you may draw a great arcanum, viz. a water of saturnine antimony, mercurial andwhite; to the end that it may whiten sol, not burning, but dissolving, and afterwards congealing to theconsistence or likeness of white cream. Therefore, saith the philosopher, this water makes the body to bevolatile; because after it has dissolved in it, and infrigidated, it ascends above and swims upon the surface ofthe water. Take, saith he, crude leaf gold, or calcined with mercury, and put it into our vinegre, made ofsaturnine antimony, mercurial, and sal ammoniac, in a broad glass vessel, and four inches high or more; put itinto a gentle heat, and in a short time you will see elevated a liquor, as it were oil swimming atop, much likea scum. Gather this with a spoon or feather dipping it in; and in doing so often times a day until nothing morearises; evaporate the water with a gentle heat, i.e., the superfluous humidity of the vinegre, and there willremain the quintessence, potestates or powers of gold in the form of a white oil incombustible. In this oil thephilosophers have placed their greatest secrets; it is exceeding sweet, and of great virtue for easing the painsof wounds. (3) The whole, then, of this antimonial secret is, that we know how by it to extract or draw forth argent vive,out of the body of Magnesia, not burning, and this is antimony, and a mercurial sublimate. That is, you mustextract a living and incombustible water, and then congeal, or coagulate it with the perfect body of sol, i.e.fine gold, without alloy; which is done by dissolving it into a nature [sic? mature?] white substance of theconsistency of cream, and made thoroughly white. But first this sol by putrefaction and resolution in thiswater, loseth all its light and brightness, and will grow dark and black; afterwards it will ascend above thewater, and by little and little will swim upon it, in a substance of a white color. And this is the whitening ofred laton to sublimate it philosophically, and to reduce it into its first matter; viz. into a white incombustiblesulphur, and into a fixed argent vive. Thus the perfect body of sol, resumeth life in this water; it is revived,inspired, grows, and is multiplied in its kind, as all other things are. For in this water, it so happens, that thebody compounded of two bodies, viz. sol and luna, is puffed up, swells, putrefies, is raised up, and doesincrease by the receiving from the vegetable and animated nature and substance. (4) Our water also, or vinegar aforesaid, is the vinegar of the mountains, i.e. of sol and luna; and therefore itis mixed with gold and silver, and sticks close to them perpetually; and the body receiveth from this water awhite tincture, and shines with inestimable brightness. Who so knows how to convert, or change the bodyinto a medicinal white gold, may easily by the same white gold change all imperfect metals into the best orfinest silver. And this white gold is called by the philosophers \"luna alba philosophorum, argentum vivumalbum fixum, aurum alchymiae, and fumus albus\" [white philosophical silver, white fixed mercury,alchemical gold and white (something)]: and therefore without this our antimonial vinegar, the aurum albumof the philosophers cannot be made. And because in our vinegar there is a double substance of argentumvivum, the one from antimony, and the other from mercury sublimated, it does give a double weight andsubstance of fixed argent vive, and also augments therein the native color, weight, substance and tinctureThe Secret Book of Artephius1"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"thereof. (5) Our dissolving water therefore carries with it a great tincture, and a great melting or dissolving; becausethat when it feels the vulgar fire, if there be in it the pure and fine bodies of sol or luna, it immediately meltsthem, and converts them into its white substance such as itself is, and gives to the body color, weight, andtincture. In it also is a power of liquefying or melting all things that can be melted or dissolved; it is a waterponderous, viscous, precious, and worthy to be esteemed, resolving all crude bodies into their prima materia,or first matter, viz. earth and a viscous powder; that is into sulphur, and argentum vivum. If therefore you putinto this water, leaves, filings, or calx of any metal, and set it in a gentle heat for a time, the whole will bedissolved, and converted into a viscous water, or white oil as aforesaid. Thus it mollifies the body, andprepares for liquefaction; yea, it makes all things fusible, viz. stones and metals, and after gives them spiritand life. And it dissolves all things with an admirable solution, transmuting the perfect body into a fusiblemedicine, melting, or liquefying, moreover fixing, and augmenting the weight and color. (6) Work therefore with it, and you shall obtain from it what you desire, for it is the spirit and soul of sol andluna; it is the oil, the dissolving water, the fountain, the Balneum Mariae, the praeternatural fire, the moistfire, the secret, hidden and invisible fire. It is also the most acrid vinegar, concerning which an ancientphilosopher saith, I besought the Lord, and he showed me a pure clear water, which I knew to be the purevinegar, altering, penetrating, and digesting. I say a penetrating vinegar, and the moving instrument forputrefying, resolving and reducing gold or silver into their prima materia or first matter. And it is the onlyagent in the universe, which in this art is able to reincrudate metallic bodies with the conservation of theirspecies. It is therefore the only apt and natural medium, by which we ought to resolve the perfect bodies ofsol and luna, by a wonderful and solemn dissolution, with the conservation of the species, and without anydestruction, unless it be to a new, more noble, and better form or generation, viz. into the perfectphilosopher's stone, which is their wonderful secret or arcanum. (7) Now this water is a certain middle substance, clear as fine silver, which ought to receive the tinctures ofsol and luna, so as they may be congealed, and changed into a white and living earth. For this water needs theperfect bodies, that with them after the dissolution, it may be congealed, fixed, and coagulated into a whiteearth. But if this solution is also their coagulation, for they have one and the same operation, because one isnot dissolved, but the other is congealed, nor is there any other water which can dissolve the bodies, but thatwhich abideth with them in the matter and the form. It cannot be permanent unless it be of the nature of otherbodies, that they may be made one. When therefore you see the water coagulate itself with the bodies that bedissolved therein; be assured that thy knowledge, way of working, and the work itself are true andphilosophic, and that you have done rightly according to art. (8) Thus you see that nature has to be amended by its own like nature; that is, gold and silver are to be exaltedin our water, as our water also with these bodies; which water is called the medium of the soul, without whichnothing has to be done in this art. It is a vegetable, mineral and animal fire, which conserves the fixed spiritsof sol and luna, but destroys and conquers their bodies; for it destroys, overturns, and changes bodies andmetallic forms, making them to be no bodies but a fixed spirit. And it turns them into a humid substance, softand fluid, which hath ingression and power to enter into other imperfect bodies, and to mix with them in theirsmallest parts, and to tinge and make them perfect. But this they could not do while they remained in theirmetallic forms or bodies, which were dry and hard, whereby they could have no entrance into other things, soto tinge and make perfect, what was before imperfect. (9) It is necessary therefore to convert the bodies of metals into a fluid substance; for that every tincture willtinge a thousand times more in a soft and liquid substance, than when it is in a dry one, as is plainly apparentin saffron. Therefore the transmutation of imperfect metals is impossible to be done by perfect bodies, whilethey are dry and hard; for which cause sake they must be brought back into their first matter, which is softand fluid. It appears therefore that the moisture must be reverted that the hidden treasure may be revealed. The Secret Book of ArtephiusThe Secret Book of Artephius2"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"And this is called the reincrudation of bodies, which is the decocting and softening them, till they lose theirhard and dry substance or form; because that which is dry doth not enter into, nor tinge anything except itsown body, nor can it be tinged except it be tinged; because, as I said before, a thick dry earthy matter does notpenetrate nor tinge, and therefore, because it cannot enter or penetrate, it can make no alteration in the matterto be altered. For this reason it is, that gold coloreth not, until its internal or hidden spirit is drawn forth out ofits bowels by this, our white water, and that it may be made altogether a spiritual substance, a white vapor, awhite spirit, and a wonderful soul. (10) It behoves us therefore by this our water to attenuate, alter and soften the perfect bodies, to wit sol andluna, that so they may be mixed other perfect bodies. From whence, if we had no other benefit by this ourantimonial water, than that it rendered bodies soft, more subtile, and fluid, according to its own nature, itwould be sufficient. But more than that, it brings back bodies to their original of sulphur and mercury, that ofthem we may afterwards in a little time, in less than an hour's time do that above ground which nature was athousand years doing underground, in the mines of the earth, which is a work almost miraculous. (11) And therefore our ultimate, or highest secret is, by this our water, to make bodies volatile, spiritual, anda tincture, or tinging water, which may have ingress or entrance into bodies; for it makes bodies to be merelyspirit, because it reduces hard and dry bodies, and prepares them for fusion, melting and dissolving; that is, itconverts them into a permanent or fixed water. And so it makes of bodies a most precious and desirable oil,which is the true tincture, and the permanent fixed white water, by nature hot and moist, or rather temperate,subtile, fusible as wax, which does penetrate, sink, tinge, and make perfect the work. And this our waterimmediately dissolves bodies (as sol and luna) and makes them into an incombustible oil, which then may bemixed with other imperfect bodies. It also converts other bodies into the nature of a fusible salt which thephilosophers call \"sal alebrot philosophorum\", better and more noble than any other salt, being in its ownnature fixed and not subject to vanish in fire. It is an oil indeed by nature hot, subtile, penetrating, sinkingthrough and entering into other bodies; it is called the perfect or great elixir, and the hidden secret of the wisesearchers of nature. He therefore that knows this salt of sol and luna, and its generation and perfection, andafterwards how go commix it, and make it homogene with other perfect bodies, he in truth knows one of thegreatest secrets of nature, and the only way that leads to perfection. (12) These bodies thus dissolved by our water are called argent vive, which is not without its sulphur, norsulphur without the fixedness of sol and luna; because sol and luna are the particular means, or medium in theform through which nature passes in the perfecting or completing thereof. And this argent vive is called ouresteemed and valuable salt, being animated and pregnant, and our fire, for that is nothing but fire; yet not fire,but sulphur; and not sulphur only, but also quicksilver drawn from sol and luna by our water, and reduced toa stone of great price. That is to say it is a matter or substance of sol and luna, or silver and gold, altered fromvileness to nobility. Now you must note that this white sulphur is the father and mother of the metals; it is ourmercury, and the mineral of gold; also the soul, and the ferment; yea, the mineral virtue, and the living body;our sulphur, and our quicksilver; that is, sulphur of sulphur, quicksilver of quicksilver, and mercury ofmercury. (13) The property therefore of our water is, that it melts or dissolves gold and silver, and increases theirnative tincture or color. For it changes their bodies from being corporeal, into a spirituality; and it is in thiswater which turns the bodies, or corporeal substance into a white vapor, which is a soul which is whitenessitself, subtile, hot and full of fire. This water also called the tinging or blood−color−making stone, being thevirtue of the spiritual tincture, without which nothing can be done; and is the subject of all things that can bemelted, and of liquefaction itself, which agrees perfectly and unites closely with sol and luna from which itcan never be separated. For it joined [joins?] in affinity to the gold and silver, but more immediately to thegold than to the silver; which you are to take special notice of. It is also called the medium of conjoining thetinctures of sol and luna with the inferior or imperfect metals; for it turns the bodies into the true tincture, totinge the said imperfect metals, also it is the water that whiteneth, as it is whiteness itself, which quickeneth, The Secret Book of ArtephiusThe Secret Book of Artephius3"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"as it is a soul; and therefore as the philosopher saith, quickly entereth into its body. (14) For it is a living water which comes to moisten the earth, that it may spring out, and in its due seasonbring forth much fruit; for all things springing from the earth, are endued through dew and moisture. Theearth therefore springeth not forth without watering and moisture; it is the water proceeding from May dewthat cleanseth the body; and like rain it penetrates them, and makes one body of two bodies. This aqua vite orwater of life, being rightly ordered and disposed with the body, it whitens it, and converts or changes it intoits white color, for this water is a white vapor, and there− fore the body is whitened with it. It behoves youtherefore to whiten the body, and open its unfoldings, for between these two, that is between the body and thewater, there is desire and friendship, like as between male and female, because of the propinquity andlikeness of their natures. (15) Now this our second and living water is called \"Azoth\", the water washing the laton viz. the bodycompounded of sol and luna by our first water; it is also called the soul of the dissolved bodies, which soulswe have even now tied together, for the use of the wise philosopher. How precious then, and how great athing is this water; for without it, the work could never be done or perfected; it is also called the \"vasenaturae\", the belly, the womb, the receptacle of the tincture, the earth, the nurse. It is the royal fountain inwhich the king and queen bathe themselves; and the mother must be put into and sealed up within the belly ofher infant; and that is sol himself, who proceeded from her, and whom she brought forth; and therefore theyhave loved one another as mother and son, and are conjoined together, because they come from one and thesame root, and are of the same substance and nature. And because this water is the water of the vegetable life,it causes the dead body to vegetate, increase and spring forth, and to rise from death to life, by beingdissolved first and then sublimed. And in doing this the body is converted into a spirit, and the spiritafterwards into a body; and then is made the amity, the peace, the concord, and the union of contraries, to wit,between the body and the spirit, which reciprocally, or mutually change their natures which they receive, andcommunicate one to another through their most minute parts, so that that which is hot is mixed with thatwhich is cold, the dry with the moist, and the hard with the soft; by which means, there is a mixture made ofcontrary natures, viz. of cold and hot, and moist with dry, even most admirable unity between enemies. (16) Our dissolution then of bodies, which is made such in this first water, is nothing else, but a destroying orovercoming of the moist with the dry, for the moist is coagulated with the dry. For the moisture is containedunder, terminated with, and coagulated in the dry body, to wit, in that which is earthy. Let therefore the hardand the dry bodies be put into our first water in a vessel, which close well, and let them there abide till theybe dissolved, and ascend to the top; then may they be called a new body, the white gold made by art, thewhite stone, the white sulphur, not inflammable, the paradisical stone, viz. the stone transmuting imperfectmetals into white silver. Then we have also the body, soul and spirit altogether; of which spirit and soul it issaid, that they cannot be extracted from the perfect bodies, but by the help or conjunction of our dissolvingwater. Because it is certain, that the things fixed cannot be lifted up, or made to ascend, but by theconjunction or help of that which is volatile. (17) The spirit, therefore, by help of the water and the soul, is drawn forth from the bodies themselves, andthe body is thereby made spiritual; for that at the same instant of time, the spirit, with the soul of the bodies,ascends on high to the superior part, which is the perfection of the stone and is called sublimation. Thissublimation, is made by things acid, spiritual, volatile, and which are in their own nature sulphureous andviscous, which dissolves bodies and makes them to ascend, and be changed into air and spirit. And in thissublimation, a certain part of our said first water ascends with the bodies, joining itself with them, ascendingand subliming into one neutral and complex substance, which contains the nature of the two, viz. the natureof the two bodies and the water. and therefore it is called the corporeal and spiritual compositum, corjufle,cambar, ethelia, zandarith, duenech, the good; but properly it is called the permanent or fixed water only,because it flies not in the fire. But it perpetually adheres to the commixed or compound bodies, that is, the soland luna, and communicates to them the living tincture, incombustible and most fixed, much more noble and The Secret Book of ArtephiusThe Secret Book of Artephius4"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"precious than the former which these bodies had. Because from henceforth this tincture runs like oil, runningthrough and penetrating bodies, and giving to them its wonderful fixity; and this tincture is the spirit, and thespirit is the soul, and the soul is the body. For in this operation, the body is made a spirit of a most subtilenature; and again, the spirit is corporified and changed into the nature of the body, with the bodies, wherebyour stone consists of a body, a soul, and a spirit. (18) O God, how through nature, doth thou change a body into a spirit: which could not be done, if the spiritwere not incorporated with the bodies, and the bodies made volatile with the spirit, and afterwards permanentand fixed. For this cause sake, they have passed over into one another, and by the influence of wisdom, areconverted into one another. O Wisdom: how thou makest the most fixed gold to be volatile and fugitive,yeah, though by nature it is the most fixed of all things in the world. It is necessary therefore, to dissolve andliquefy these bodies by our water, and to make them a permanent or fixed water, a pure, golden water leavingin the bottom the gross, earthy, superfluous and dry matter. And in this subliming, making thin and pure, thefire ought to be gentle; but if in this subliming with soft fire, the bodies be not purified, and the gross andearthy parts thereof (note this well) be not separated from the impurities of the dead, you shall not be able toperfect the work. For thou needest nothing but the thin and subtile part of the dissolved bodies, which ourwater will give thee, if thou proceedest with a slow or gentle fire, by separating the things heterogene fromthe things homogene. (19) This compositum then has its mundification or cleaning, by our moist fire, whichby dissolving and subliming that which is pure and white, it cast forth its feces or filth like a voluntary vomit,for in such a dissolution and natural sublimation or lifting up, there is a loosening or untying of the elements,and a cleansing and separating of the pure from the impure. So that the pure and white substance ascendsupwards and the impure and earthy remains fixed in the bottom of the water and the vessel. This must betaken away and removed, because it is of no value, taking only the middle white substance, flowing andmelted or dissolved, rejecting the feculent earth, which remains below in the bottom. These feces wereseparated partly by the water, and are the dross and terra damnata, which is of no value, nor can do any suchservice as the clear, white, pure and clear matter, which is wholly and only to be taken and made use of. (20) And against this capharean rock, the ship of knowledge, or art of the young philosopher is often, as ithappened also to me sometimes, dashed together in pieces, or destroyed, because the philosophers for themost part speak by the contraries. That is to say that nothing must be removed or taken away, except themoisture, which is the blackness; which notwithstanding they speak and write only to the unwary, who,without a master, indefatigable reading, or humble supplications to God Almighty, would ravish away thegolden fleece. It is therefore to be observed, that this separation, division, and sublimation, is without a doubtthe key to the whole work. [the first 20 chapters of this treatise were presented under the heading 'the secret book' (chapter 3 of 'inpursuit of gold'). at this point is begun chapter 4, 'the wisdom of artephius', which contains the balance of thetreatise. I feel the division is significant, though I couldn't quite say why] (21) After the putrefaction, then, and dissolution of these bodies, our bodies also ascend to the top, even tothe surface of the dissolving water, in a whiteness of color, which whiteness is life. And in this whiteness, theantimonial and mercurial soul, is by natural compact infused into, and joined with the spirits of sol and luna,which separate the thin from the thick, and the pure from the impure. That is, by lifting up, by little and little,the thin and the pure part of the body, from the feces and impurity, until all the pure parts are separated andascended. And in this work is out natural and philosophical sublimation work completed. Now in thiswhiteness is the soul infused into the body, to wit, the mineral virtue, which is more subtile than fire, beingindeed the true quintessence and life, which desires or hungers to be born again, and to put off thedefilements and be spoiled of its gross and earthy feces, which it has taken from its monstrous womb, andcorrupt place of its original. And in this our philosophical sublimation, not in the impure, corrupt, vulgarmercury, which has no qualities or properties like to those, with which our mercury, drawn from its vitrioliccaverns is adorned. But let us return to our sublimation. The Secret Book of ArtephiusThe Secret Book of Artephius5"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"(22) It is most certain therefore in this art, that this soul extracted from the bodies, cannot be made to ascend,but by adding to it a volatile matter, which is of its own kind. By which the bodies will be made volatile andspiritual, lifting themselves up, subtilizing and subliming themselves, contrary to their own proper nature,which is corporeal, heavy and ponderous. And by this means they are unbodied, or made no bodies, to wit,incorporeal, and a quintessence of the nature of a spirit, which is called, \"avis hermetis\", and \"mercuriusextractus\", drawn from a red subject or matter. And so the terrene or earthy parts remain below, or rather thegrosser parts of the bodies, which can by no industry or ingenuity of man be brought to a perfect dissolution.(23) And this white vapor, this white gold, to wit, this quintessence, is called also the compound magnesia,which like a man does contain, or like a man is composed of a body, soul and spirit. Now the body is thefixed solar earth, exceeding the most subtile matter, which by the help of our divine water is with difficultylifted up or separated. The soul is the tincture of sol and luna, proceeding from the conjunction, orcommunication of these two, to wit, the bodies of sol and luna, and our water, and the spirit is the mineralpower, or virtue of the bodies, and also out of the bodies like as the tinctures or colors in dying cloth are bythe water put upon, and diffused in and through the cloth. And this mercurial spirit is the chain or band of thesolar soul; and the solar body is that body which contains the spirit and soul, having the power of fixing initself, being joined with luna. The spirit therefore penetrates, the body fixes, and the soul joins together,tinges and whitens. From these three bodies united together is our stone made: to wit, sol, luna and mercury. (24) Therefore with this our golden water, a natural substance is extracted, exceeding all natural substances;and so, except the bodies be broken and destroyed, imbibed, made subtile and fine, thriftily, and diligentlymanaged, till they are abstracted from, or lose their grossness or solid substance, and be changed into asubtile spirit, all our labor will be in vain. And unless the bodies be made no bodies or incorporeal, that isconverted into the philosophers mercury, there is no rule of art yet found out to work by. The reason is,because it is impossible to draw out of the bodies all that most thin and subtile spirit, which has in itself thetincture, except it first be resolved in our water. Dissolve then the bodies in this our golden water, and boilthem until all the tincture is brought forth by the water, in a white color and a white oil; and when you seethis whiteness upon the water, then know that the bodies are melted, liquified or dissolved. Continue then thisboiling, till the dark, black, and white cloud is brought forth, which they have conceived. (25) Put therefore the perfect bodies of metals, to wit, sol and luna, into our water in a vessel, hermeticallysealed, upon a gentle fire, and digest continually, till they are perfectly resolved into a most precious oil.Saith Adfar, digest with a gentle fire, as it were for the hatching of chickens, so long till the bodies aredissolved, and their perfectly conjoined tincture is extracted, mark this well. But it is not extracted all at once,but it is drawn out by little and little, day by day, and hour by hour, till after a long time, the solution thereofis completed, and that which is dissolved always swims atop. And while this dissolution is in hand, let the firebe gentle and continual, till the bodies are dissolved into a viscous and most subtile water, and the wholetincture be educed, in color first black, which is the sign of a true dissolution. (26) Then continue the digestion, till it become a white fixed water, for being digested in balneo, it willafterwards become clear, and in the end become like common argent vive, ascending by the spirit above thefirst water. When there you see bodies dissolved in the first viscous water, then know, that they are turnedinto a vapor, and the soul is separated from the dead body, and by sublimation, turned into the order of spirits.Whence both of them, with a part of our water, are made spirits flying up in the air; and there thecompounded body, made of the male and female, viz. of sol and luna, and of that most subtile nature,cleansed by sublimation, taketh life, and is made spiritual by its own humidity. That is by its own water; likeas a man is sustained by the air, whereby from thenceforth it is multiplied, and increases in its own kind, asdo all other things. In such an ascention therefore, and philosophical sublimation, all are joined one withanother, and the new body subtilized, or made living by the spirit, miraculously liveth or springs like avegetable. The Secret Book of ArtephiusThe Secret Book of Artephius6"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"(27) Wherefore, unless the bodies be attenuated, or made thin, by the fire and water, till they ascend in aspirit, and are made or do become like water and vapor or mercury, you labor wholly in vain. But when theyarise or ascend, they are born or brought forth in the air or spirit, and in the same they are changed, and madelife with life, so as they can never be separated, but are as water mixed with water. And therefore, it is wiselysaid, that the stone is born of the spirit, because it is altogether spiritual. For the vulture himself flyingwithout wings cries upon the top of the mountain, saying, I am the white brought forth from the black, andthe red brought forth from the white, the citrine son of the red; I speak the truth and lie not. (28) It sufficeth thee then to put the bodies in the vessel, and into the water once and for all, and to close thevessel well, until a true separation is made. This the obscure artist calls conjunction, sublimation, assation,extraction, putrefaction, ligation, desponsation, subtilization, generation, etc. (29) Now the whole magistery may be perfected, work, as in the generation of man, and of every vegetable;put the seed once into the womb, and shut it up well. Thus you may see that you need not many things, andthat this our work requires no great charges, for that there is but one stone, there is but one medicine, onevessel, one order of working, and one successive disposition to the white and to the red. And although we sayin many places, take this, and take that, yet we understand, that it behoves us to take but one thing, and put itonce into the vessel, until the work be perfected. But these things are so set down by obscure philosophers todeceive the unwary, as we have before spoken; for is not this \"ars cabalistica\" or a secret and a hidden art? Isit not an art full of secrets? And believest thou O fool that we plainly teach this secret of secrets, taking ourwords according to their literal signification? Truly, I tell thee, that as for myself, I am no ways self seeking,or envious as others are; but he that takes the words of the other philosophers according to their commonsignification, he even already, having lost Ariadne's clue of thread, wanders in the midst of the labyrinth,multiplies errors, and casts away his money for naught. (30) And I, Artephius, after I became an adept, and had attained to the true and complete wisdom, bystudying the books of the most faithful Hermes, the speaker of truth, was sometimes obscure also as otherswere. But when I had for the space of a thousand years, or thereabouts, which has now passed over my head,since the time I was born to this day, through the alone goodness of God Almighty, by the use of thiswonderful quintessence. When I say for so very long a time, I found no man had found out or obtained thishermetic secret, because of the obscurity of the philosophers words. Being moved with a generous mind, andthe integrity of a good man, I have determined in these latter days of my life, to declare all things truly andsincerely, that you may not want anything for the perfecting of this stone of the philosophers. Excepting onecertain thing, which is not lawful for me to discover to any, because it is either revealed or made known byGod himself, or taught by some master, which notwithstanding he that can bend himself to the search thereof,by the help of a little experience, may easily learn in this book. (31) In this book I have therefore written the naked truth, though clothed or disguised with few colors; yet sothat every good and wise man may happily have those desirable apples of the Hesperides from this ourphilosophers tree. Wherefore praises be given to the most high God, who has poured into our soul of hisgoodness; and through a good old age, even an almost infinite number of years, has truly filled our heartswith his love, in which, methinks, I embrace, cherish, and truly love all mankind together. But to return to outbusiness. Truly our work is perfectly performed; for that which the heat of sun is a hundred years in doing,for the generation of one metal in the bowels of the earth; our secret fire, that is, our fiery and sulphureouswater, which is called Balneum Mariae, doth as I have often seen in a very short time. (32) Now this operation or work is a thing of no great labor to him who knows and understands it; nor is thematter so dear, consideration [sic, considering?] how small a quantity does suffice, that it may cause any manto withdraw his hand from it. It is indeed, a work so short and easy, that it may well be called woman's work,and the play of children. Go to it then,, my son, put up thy supplications to God almighty; be diligent insearching the books of the learned in this science; for one book openeth another; think and meditate of these The Secret Book of ArtephiusThe Secret Book of Artephius7"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"things profoundly; and avoid all things which vanish in or will not endure the fire, because from theseadjustible, perishing or consuming things, you can never attain to the perfect matter, which is only found inthe digesting of your water, extracted from sol and luna. For by this water, color, and ponderosity or weight,are infinitely given to the matter; and this water is a white vapor, which like a soul flows through the perfectbodies, taking wholly from them their blackness, and impurities, uniting the two bodies in one, and increasingtheir water. Nor is there any other thing than Azoth, to wit, this our water, which can take from the perfectbodies of sol and luna, their natural color, making the red body white, according to the disposition thereof. (33) Now let us speak of the fire. Our fire is mineral, equal, continuous; it fumes not, unless it be too muchstirred up, participates of sulphur, and is taken from other things than from the matter; it overturns all things,dissolves, congeals, and calcines, and is to be found out by art, or after an artificial manner. It is acompendious thing, got without cost or charge, or at least without any great purchase; it is humid, vaporous,digestive, altering, penetrating, subtile, spiritous, not violent, incombustible, circumspective, continent, andone only thing. It is also a fountain of living water, which circumvolveth and contains the place, in which theking and queen bathe themselves; through the whole work this moist fire is sufficient; in the beginning,middle and end, because in it, the whole of the art does consist. This is the natural fire, which is yet againstnature, not natural and which burns not; lastly, this fire is hot, cold, dry, moist; meditate on these things andproceed directly without anything of a foreign nature. If you understand not these fires, give ear to what Ihave yet to say, never as yet written in any book, but drawn from the more abstruse and occult riddles of theancients. (34) We have properly three fires, without which our art cannot be perfected; and whosoever works withoutthem takes a great deal of labor in vain. The first fire is that of the lamp, which is continuous, humid,vaporous, spiritous, and found out by art. This lamp ought to be proportioned to the enclosure; wherein youmust use great judgement, which none can attain to, but he that can bend to the search thereof. For if this fireof the lamp be not measured, or duly proportioned or fitted to the furnace, it will be, that either for the wantof heat you will not see the expected signs, in their limited times, whereby you will lose your hopes andexpectation by a too long delay; or else, by reason of too much heat, you will burn the \"flores auri\", thegolden flowers, and so foolishly bewail your lost expense. (35) The second fire is ignis cinerum, an ash heat, in which the vessel hermetically sealed is recluded, orburied; or rather it is that most sweet and gentle heat, which proceeding from the temperate vapors of thelamp, does equally surround your vessel. This fire is not violent or forcing, except it be too much excited orstirred up; it is a fire digestive; alterative, and taken from another body than the matter; being but one only,moist also, and not natural. (36) The third fire, is the natural fire of water, which is also called the fire againstnature, because it is water; and yet nevertheless, it makes a mere spirit of gold, which common fire is not ableto do. This fire is mineral, equal, and participates of sulphur; it overturns or destroys, congeals, dissolves, andcalcines; it is penetrating, subtile, incombustible and not burning, and is the fountain of living water, whereinthe king and queen bathe themselves, whose help we stand in need of through the whole work, through thebeginning, middle, and end. But the other two above mentioned, we have not always occasion for, but only atsometimes. In reading therefore the books of the philosophers, conjoin these three fires in your judgement,and without doubt, you will understand whatever they have written of them. (37) Now as to the colors, that which does not make black cannot make white, because blackness is thebeginning of whiteness, and a sign of putrefaction and alteration, and that the body is now penetrated andmortified. From the putrefaction therefore in this water, there first appears blackness, like unto broth whereinsome bloody thing is boiled. Secondly, the black earth by continual digestion is whitened, because the soul ofthe two bodies swims above upon the water, like white cream; and in this only whiteness, all the spirits are sounited, that they can never fly one from another. And therefore the laton must be whitened, and its leavesunfolded, i.e., its body broken or opened, lest we labor in vain; for this whiteness is the perfect stone for thewhite work, and a body ennobled to that end; even a tincture of a most exuberant glory, and shining The Secret Book of ArtephiusThe Secret Book of Artephius8"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"brightness, which never departs from the body it is once joined with. Therefore you must note here, that thespirits are not fixed but in the white color, which is more noble than the other colors, and is more vehementlyto be desired, for that as it were the complement or perfection of the whole work. (38) For our earth putrefies and becomes black, then it is putrefied in lifting up or separation; afterwardsbeing dried, its blackness goes away from it, and then it is whitened, and the feminine dominion of thedarkness and humidity perisheth; then also the white vapor penetrates through the new body, and the spiritsare bound up or fixed in the dryness. And that which is corrupting, deformed and black through the moisture,vanishes away; so the new body rises again clear, pure, white and immortal, obtaining the victory over all itsenemies. And as heat working upon that which is moist, causeth or generates blackness, which is the prime orfirst color, so always by decoction more and more heat working upon that which is dry begets whiteness,which is the second color; and then working upon that which is purely and perfectly dry, it produces citrinityand redness, thus much for colors. WE must know therefore, that thing which has its head red and white, butits feet white and afterwards red; and its eyes beforehand black, that this thing, I say, is the only matter of ourmagistery. (39) Dissolve then sol and luna in our dissolving water, which is familiar and friendly, and next in nature tothem; and is also sweet and pleasant to them, and as it were a womb, a mother, an original, the beginning andthe end of their life. That is the reason why they are meliorated or amended in this water, because like nature,rejoices in like nature, and like nature retains like nature, being joined the one to the other, in a true marriage,by which they are made one nature, one new body, raised again from the dead, and immortal. Thus it behovesyou to join consanguinity, or sameness of kind, by which these natures, will meet and follow one another,purify themselves and generate, and make one another rejoice; for that like nature now is disposed by likenature, even that which is nearest, and most friendly to it. (40) Our water then is the most beautiful, lovely, and clear fountain, prepared only for the king, and queenwhom it knows very well, and they it. For it attracts them to itself, and they abide therein for two or threedays, to wit, two or three months, to wash themselves therewith, whereby they are made young again andbeautiful. And because sol and luna have their original from this water their mother; it is necessary thereforethat they enter into it again, to wit, into their mothers womb, that they may be regenerated and born again,and made more healthy, more noble and more strong. If therefore these do not die and be converted to water,they remain alone or as they were and without fruit; but if they die, and are resolved in our water, they bringforth fruit of a hundred fold; and from that very place in which they seem to perish, from thence shall theyappear to be that which they were not before. (41) Let therefore the spirit of our living water be, with all care and industry, fixed with sol and luna; for theybeing converted into the nature of water become dead, and appear like to the dead; from thence afterwardsbeing revived, they increase and multiply, even as do all sorts of vegetable substances; it suffices then todispose the matter sufficiently without, because that within, it sufficiently disposes itself for the perfection ofits work. For it has in itself a certain and inherent motion, according to the true way and method, and a muchbetter order than it is possible for any man to invent or think of. For this cause it is that you need only preparethe matter, nature herself will perfect it; and if she be not hindered by some contrary thing, she will notoverpass her own certain motion, neither in conceiving or generating, nor in bringing forth. (42) Wherefore, after the preparation of the matter, beware only lest by too much heat or fire, you inflame thebath, or make it too hot; secondly, take heed lest the spirit should exhale, lest it hurt the operator, to wit, lestit destroy the work, and induce many informities, as trouble, sadness, vexation, and discontent. From thesethings which have been spoken, this axiom is manifest, to wit, that he can never know the necessary course ofnature, in the making or generating of metals, who is ignorant of the way of destroying them. You musttherefore join them together that are of one consanguinity or kindred; for like natures do find out and joinwith their like natures, and by putrifying themselves, and mix together and mortify themselves. It is needful The Secret Book of ArtephiusThe Secret Book of Artephius9"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"therefore to know this corruption and generation, and the natures themselves do embrace one another, and arebrought to a fixity in a slow and gentle fire; how like natures rejoiceth with like natures; and how they retainone another and are converted into a white consistency. (43) This white substance, if you will make it red, you must continually decoct it in a dry fire till it berubified, or become red as blood, which is nothing but water, fire, and true tincture. And so by a continual dryfire, the whiteness is changed, removed, perfected, made citrine, and still digested till it become to a true redand fixed color. And consequently by how much more it is heightened in color, and made a true tincture ofperfect redness. Wherefore with a dry fire, and a dry calcination, without any moisture, you must decoct thiscompositum, till it be invested with a most perfect red color, and then it will be the true and perfect elixir. (44) Now if afterwards you would multiply your tincture, you must again resolve that red, in new and freshdissolving water, and then by decoctions first whiten, and then rubify it again, by the degrees of fire,reiterating the first method of operating in this work. Dissolve, coagulate, and reiterate the closing up, theopening and multiplying in quantity and quality at your own pleasure. For by a new corruption andgeneration, there is introduced a new motion. Thus we can never find an end if we do always work byreiterating the same thing over and over again, viz. by solution and coagulation, by the help of our dissolvingwater, by which we dissolve and congeal, as we have formerly said, in the beginning of the work. Thus alsois the virtue thereof increased, and multiplied both in quantity and quality; so that if after the first course ofthe operation you obtain a hundred fold; by the second fold you will have a thousand fold; and by the third;ten thousand fold increase. And by pursuing your work, your projection will come to infinity, tinging trulyand perfectly, and fixing the greatest quantity how much soever. Thus by a thing of small and easy price, youhave both color, goodness, and weight. (45) Our fire then and azoth are sufficient for you: decoct, reiterate, dissolve, congeal, and continue thiscourse, according as you please, multiplying it as you think good, until your medicine is made fusible as wax,and has attained the quantity and goodness or fixity and color you desire. This then is the compleating of thewhole work of our second stone (observe it well) that you take the perfect body, and put it into our water in aglass vesica or body well closed, lest the air get in or the enclosed humidity get out. Keep it in digestion in agentle heat, as it were of a balneum, and assiduously continue the operation or work upon the fire, till thedecoction and digestion is perfect. And keep it in this digestion of a gentle heat, until it be purified andre−solved into blackness, and be drawn up and sublimed by the water, and is thereby cleaned from allblackness and impurity, that it may be white and subtile. Until it comes to the ultimate or highest purity ofsublimation, and utmost volatility, and be made white both within and without: for the vulture flying in theair without wings, cries out that it might get up upon the mountain, that is upon the waters, upon which the\"spiritus albus\" or spirit of whiteness is born. Continue still a fitting fire, and that spirit, which is the subtilebeing of the body, and of the mercury will ascend upon the top of the water, which quintessence is morewhite than the driven snow. Continue yet still, and towards the end, increase the fire, till the whole spiritualsubstance ascend to the top. And know well, that whatsoever is clear, white−pure and spiritual, ascends in theair to the top of the water in the substance of a white vapor, which the philosophers call their virgin milk. (46) It ought to be, therefore, as one of the Sybills said, that the son of the virgin be exalted from the earth,and that the white quintessence after its rising out of the dead earth, be raised up towards heaven; the grossand thick remaining in the bottom, of the vessel and the water. Afterwards, the vessel being cooled, you willfind in the bottom the black feces, scorched and burnt, which separate from the spirit and quintessence ofwhiteness, and cast them away. Then will the argent vive fall down from our air and spirit, upon the newearth, which is called argent vive sublimed by the air or spirit, whereof is made a viscous water, pure andwhite. This water is the true tincture separated from all its black feces, and our brass or latten is prepared withour water, purified and brought to a white color. Which white color is not obtained but by decoction andcoagulation of the water; decoct, therefore, continually, wash away the blackness from the latten, not withyour hands, but with the stone, or the fire, or our second mercurial water which is the true tincture. This The Secret Book of ArtephiusThe Secret Book of Artephius10"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"separation of the pure from the impure is not done with hands, but nature herself does it, and brings it toperfection by a circular operation. (47) It appears then, that this composition is not a work of hands, but a change of the natures; because naturedissolves and joins itself, sublimes and lifts itself up, and grows white, being separated from the feces. And insuch a sublimation the more subtile, pure, and essential parts are conjoined; for that with the fiery nature orproperty lifts up the subtile parts, it separates always the more pure, leaving the grosser at the bottom.Wherefore your fire ought to be gentle and a continual vapor, with which you sublime, that the matter may befilled with spirit from the air, and live. For naturally all things take life from the inbreathing of the air; and soalso our magistery receives in the vapor or spirit, by the sublimation of the water. (48) Our brass or lattenthen, is to be made to ascend by the degrees of fire, but of its own accord, freely, and without violence;except the body therefore be by the fire and water broken, or dissolved, and attenuated, until it ascends as aspirit, or climbs like argent vive, or rather as the white soul, separated from the body, and by sublimationdiluted or brought into a spirit, nothing is or can be done. But when it ascends on high, it is born in the air orspirit, and is changed into spirit; and becomes life with life, being only spiritual and incorruptible. And bysuch an operation it is that the body is made spirit, of a subtile nature, and the spirit is incorporated with thebody, and made one with it; and by such a sublimation, conjunction, and raising up, the whole, both body andspirit are made white. (49) This philosophical and natural sublimation therefore is necessary which makes peace between, or fixesthe body and spirit, which is impossible to be done otherwise, than in the separation of these parts. Thereforeit behoves you to sublime both, that the pure may ascend, and the impure may descend, or be left at thebottom, in the perplexity of a troubled sea. And for this reason it must be continually decocted, that it may bebrought to a subtile property, and the body may assume, and draw to itself the white mercurial soul, which itnaturally holds, and suffers not to be separated from it, because it is like to it in the nearness of the first pureand simple nature. From these things it is necessary, to make a separation by decoction, till no more remainsof the purity of the soul, which is not ascended and exalted to the higher part, whereby they will both bereduced to an equality of properties, and a simple pure whiteness. (50) The vulture flying through the air, and the toad creeping upon the ground, are the emblems of ourmagistery. When therefore gently and with much care, you separate the earth from the water, that is from thefire, and the thin from the thick, then that which is pure will separate itself from the earth, and ascend to theupper part, as it were into heaven, and the impure will descend beneath, as to the earth. And the more subtilepart in the superior place will take upon it the nature of a spirit, and that in the lower place, the nature of anearthy body. Wherefore, let the white property with the more subtile part of the body, be by this operation,made to ascend leaving the feces behind, which is done in a short time. For the soul is aided by her associateand fellow, and perfected by it. My mother, saith the body, has begotten me, and by me she herself isbegotten; now after I have taken from her, her flying she after an admirable manner becomes kind andnourishing, and cherishing the son whom she has begotten till he come to a ripe or perfect age. (51) Hear now this secret: keep the body in our mercurial water, till it ascends with the white soul, and theearthy part descends to the bottom, which is called the residing earth. Then you shall see the water coagulateitself with the body, and be assured the art is true; because the body coagulates the moisture into dryness, likeas the rennet of a lamb or calf turns milk into cheese. In the same manner the spirit penetrates the body, and isperfectly comixed with it in its smallest atoms, and the body draws to itself his moisture, to wit, its whitesoul, like as the loadstone draws iron, because of the nearness and likeness of its nature; and then onecontains the other. And this is the sublimation and coagulation, which retaineth every volatile thing, makingit fixed for ever. (52) This compositum then is not a mechanical thing, or a work of the hands, but as I said, a changing ofnatures; and a wonderful connection of their cold with hot, and the moist with the dry; the hot is mixed with The Secret Book of ArtephiusThe Secret Book of Artephius11"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"the cold, and the dry with the moist: By this means is made the mixture and conjunction of body and spirit,which is called a conversion of contrary spirits and natures, because by such a dissolution and sublimation,the spirit is converted into a body and body in a spirit. So that the natures being mixed together, and reducedinto one, do change one another: and as the body corporifies the spirit, or changes it into a body, so also doesthe spirit convert the body into a tinging and white spirit. (53) Wherefore as the last time I say, decoct the body in our white water, viz. mercury, till it is dissolved intoblackness, and then by continual decoction, let it be deprived of the same blackness, and the body sodissolved, will at length ascend or rise with a white soul. And then the one will be mixed with the other, andso embrace one another that it shall not be possible any more to separate them, but the spirit, with a realagreement, will be unified with the body, and make one permanent or fixed substance. And this is thesolution of the body, and coagulation of the spirit which have one and the same operation. Who thereforeknows how to conjoin the principles, or direct the work, to impregnate, to mortify, to putrefy, to generate, toquicken the species, to make white, to cleanse the culture from its blackness and darkness, till he is purged bythe fire and tinged, and purified from all his spots, shall be the possessor of a treasure so great that even kingsthemselves shall venerate him. (54) Wherefore, let our body remain in the water till it is dissolved into a subtile powder in the bottom of thevessel and the water, which is called the black ashes; this is the corruption of the body which is called by thephilosophers or wise men, \"Saturnus plumbum philosophorum\", and pulvis discontinuatus, viz. saturn, lattenor brass, the lead of the philosophers the disguised powder. And in this putrefaction and resolution of thebody, three signs appear, viz., a black color, a discontinuity of parts, and a stinking smell, not much unlike tothe smell of a vault where dead bodies are buried. These ashes then are those of which the philosophers havespoken so much which remained in the lower part of the vessel, which we ought not to undervalue or despise;in them is the royal diadem, and the black and unclean argent vive, which ought to be cleansed from itsblackness, by a continual digestion in our water, till it be elevated above in a white color, which is called thegander, and the bird of Hermes. He therefore that maketh the red earth black, and then renders it white, hasobtained the magistery. So also he who kills the living, and revives the dead. Therefore make the black white,and the white black, and you perfect the work. (55) And when you see the true whiteness appear, which shineth like a bright sword, or polished silver, knowthat in that whiteness there is redness hidden. But then beware that you take not that whiteness out of thevessel, but only digest it to the end, that with heat and dryness, it may assume a citron color, and a mostbeautiful redness. Which when you see, render praises and thanksgiving to the most great and good God, whogives wisdom and riches to whomsoever He pleases, and takes them away according to the wickedness of aperson. To Him, I say, the most wise and almighty God, be glory for ages and ages.AMEN. The Secret Book of ArtephiusThe Secret Book of Artephius12"}]
