Dear Brethren: The Need and anxiety has mounted high, and the burden to great, that they nearly almost all crushed us into the dark grave, where all consolation ends, because we must complain day and night, that the Lord forsakes us, and in his righteous anger banishes us from his Sanctuary, which waste, and the heathen were called in for abuse, and we be destroyed here and there with mockery and scorn, under pure pressure lie under servants of the heathen and unbelievers, and must endure from such all troubles, so contrived.

Guard yourself, however, that you do not engage with such, for they must bear the load of the Lord. Make yourself however liable for servants and maids; separate them among you, in order that their seed cease and die out. Yes they will be your wood and water carriers according to the words of the Lord. Therefore have patience and suffer all oppressions. Avoid however also and shun all vice. Hold to the one God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, and think how often that the Lord has freed you from your enemies, that, where you hold to him that finally your heartbreak came to him, that he freed you from the disgrace of the slanderer, because they say in Psalm 95 v. 2.

The marks stand to this hour, that even a blind man among you will be able to find it, but only when the great Prophet Elias will be present. For if you have likewise all marks you will get it not till this time comes. Some, it is true have already gone out of their wits, and have sought and found the place, but at opening of the same has fire sprung out, that they have partly perished.

But the great Jehovah will not eternally retain anger, but will gather us shortly to receive our inheritance again. In order that you know when the time comes to be informed where our Priests and the principal secrets of the time have concealed away, as Titus Vespasianus the Tyrant, who devastated and burned the Holy City and the Sanctuary, so mark.

This is yet till this notice concealed, and will at the time when Elias with the Messiah comes, be found. Therefore dear brethren sign and groan with desire after such; for at that time your enemies everywhere will be extirpated. There have been some brethren who received news of this secret from their fathers. These have ventured, and have there gone in order to help their brethren. This was a good intention only; because such were not from the race of Judah and also the marks they did not understand, for they began without instruction of the same to work, they found it not, Had they understood the marks, so would they have found the concealed, if the God of Abraham and Isaac had not held his hand over it.

Then at this time will your enemies begin to badly plague you; but be comforted, you will then get the sword in your hands, that you may fight your enemies.

Yet must you remember this necessary manipulation, when you have a right fat Marcz, and with dew or Water Grandi extrahiret so now you boil such down, so expert that in it a Salt can crystallize, and on account of the great fatness and fat viscosity of this Salt. When you see this, so let it safely evaporate to a thick liquor. This liquor is far better than the crystals. With such you can go to work, that you mix therewith so much of its own thoroughly heated and lixiviated Earth, and then distill over, as has been taught, and so you get at once so much of this Volatile Spirit. The fixed salt remains behind, which can be lixiviated and goes in the work as said before. Guard yourself however that these Secrets come not into your enemies hands. Conceal it from them as you only can, till the time of deliverance comes. Then rejoice the forsaken daughters, that the Lord and Holy Adonai has made an end to your ignominy. http://www.rexresearch.com/abrelzar/abrelzar.htm\r (15 of 73)12/04/2008 11.59.07"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"Abraham Eleazar: The Book of Abraham the Jew (Alchemy) Plate INumber 2I, Abraham Eleazar continue to teach you Dear Brethren, as our Fathers in the Wilderness sinned against the Lord through Idolatry, Moses made for them a brazen Serpent and stuck it to a Cross, that such would be seen by all the people, and they again from their merited plaque might recover. http://www.rexresearch.com/abrelzar/abrelzar.htm\r (16 of 73)12/04/2008 11.59.07"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"Abraham Eleazar: The Book of Abraham the Jew (Alchemy)Therefore know, when you can fasten with a Golden Nail, the Serpent Python on his Cross, so will you want nothing in Wisdom.

Therefore direct all your thoughts to the Phyton. Nam est un Phytone quicquid queerunt, Sapientes. For nothing in the world has such a power to destroy Metals. As the Phyton alone, but, dear brethren it is not the common Phyton, but our Spirit Phytonis, although with the common Phyton, our Spirit Phytonis is infinitum multuplicirrt, for out Spirit Phytonis transmutes the common into its nature, as it also changes the nature of Sol and all Metals, for it is the Primum Ens Metallorum, that is, the Spring of the Ancients, the flower with golden leaves and so from pulling and tearing the poisonous dragon is covered and preserved.

Dear brethren, the Ancients have not had one Way in preparing of this Mystery.

This is the King, which is eaten by the Wolf, and again Vomited forth.

When this has happened, then put the Alembic in sand, and give Fire, now when you think that the Alembic is heated, pour through a filter of the mixed Liquor, through the hole in the still, so will the Calx Vive be heated, you must however close the hole firmly and must not pour too much on the Calx Vive at once, otherwise it would run over (pour it on gradually), then will thy Spirit go over, collect it, and rectify it yet once per se. With this you can extract from each Minera its Anima, whenever you wish; the menstruum can be prepared without Fire, but the Calx Vive must be good, and is also better in the Operation, when one will prepare this, so instead of Urine take a strong Spirit of Tartar; so also must everything be well rectified and clean, then it is practicable.

Dear brethren, one says: Titulus Inventionus may be often Potior Pars Inventionis.

Alone the dear Ancients have learned through diligent speculation of Nature, what was their origin before the commencement, and out of What the Life of all creatures took its origin, and how the Generation and commencement of the Metals may have their Origin. This the dear Ancients have very closely observed, examined and found, that all metals took their origin ex mercury or Phythone, thence are they driven, and have taken the Phyton, and have also therewith gone to work. They have however experienced harm with such because it has become too metallic; so have they sought an other materiam, in which the Spirit Mercury is not yet made metallic; and found such likewise among the Minerals, and afterwards called this with divers names, as Albaon in Arabic, in Latin, Plumbum Nigrum, Abackhozodi, a black heavy stuff; they have also called it Magnesium, Bismuth.

Chap. 23, V. 14; has learned it by preserving the secret arcane of his forefathers, and Moses’ miracles. And how could David assist the necessitous, if he knew no way to help himself? Yes David, before he could prepare Sol and Luna, he got bread for himself, for he was not sure. Of Solomon it is said in Kings 3, Chap. 10. that he made as much Sol and Luna as there are stones. It stands that it is true, that he had it brought in ships from Ophir, where however did David get it hither? And why has Roboam’s son been obliged after his death to live in such poverty? Was he not able to send ships to Ophir, in order to fetch Sol? Certainly this King, because he wanted Wisdom, that comes from the Lord, would not have been able to fill his covetousness. But Ophiris Sol is something quite different.

That you might understand me, what I at present draw before you! For I speak even with you, as with children, not in dark words. Get learning and then set out to do the work, that your poor brethren might be relieved from anxiety. Think yet how their minds are troubled under their oppression, that they cannot once raise their heads on high for distress; therefore my heart breaks, to show you a way, to help you and them. Can you not work, then pray to the Lord, that he will give you wisdom: Daniel Ch. 5, V. 21 and 22. It is forsooth easy and insignificant, if you only loosen yourself from all expensive things in the world. Therefore dear Brethren, have I here drawn you a figure, where you may have two ways before your eyes. First you see, how the Old Albaon chops off with his sword the intractable Winged feet of the Phytoni, and that the Phyton has in his hands a staff, the meaning of this is, that when such has happened, he then has a two-fold nature, which the two serpents point out. This Old Procreator is drawn out once from the Primordialis Chaos, that is signified from the Fire appearing Dragon. But however the Old One floats in the Air, denoted the Spiritus Universalem or Phyton, the beginning of all things, as I, dear brethren, have taught you in the beginning. The Old One however has a Scythe or reaping hook, and will cut off the feet of the Phyton, which is an indication that such also can be prepared from another Materia than out of the Albaon, which is a black grey and heavy Materia, and one can get in abundance. And that the Old One floats in the Air has the meaning, that from this Old One, as I taught you before you shall prepare the Columba Dianae, and such blend with the Phytone, and once more cause it to rise, and then you get a two-fold Phyton, or the right Gluten, the fiery Dragon in the wet way. http://www.rexresearch.com/abrelzar/abrelzar.htm\r (36 of 73)12/04/2008 11.59.07"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"Abraham Eleazar: The Book of Abraham the Jew (Alchemy)But there is prepared from the Green Lion a crawling Dragon, and you have it before your eyes, and can compare with the Old One the wet way, and the Dragons the dry way. In the work you go one, beyond, in the dry way in the preparatory work, there is another Modus than in the Wet. Dear brethren, that I may show you, however, that the Ancients possessed more secrets, for they are not all united in their ideas. Those who had not the understanding, that they could fabricate the Lapis Albaohest or the Phyton of the Ancients, yet have they known the Materiam, and have been in a position to go to work on such. They have seen that the Alatron could be extracted from the Excrements of animals, so did they come on the thought that in Man, the most eminent production; in and out of which such excrement was frequently to be got. They have therefore collected from healthy males their Urine, and let such stand in casks to putrefy. Then have they prepared through many distillations a volatile Spirit Phytonis, as well in a dry form as also a Liquor in an horrible fiery form and Property therefrom. This they have well preserved, and kept it in an Alingel, then they have here conveyed and have prepared from the Noble Wine their Heaven and Spiritus Phytonis. These two fiery Dragons they have poured together, and again driven over, till the most of which ascended into a white Gluten; which they have put into an Alingel, and raised, then they have taken of the Kalii and of the Salt Earth equal parts, and out of both have driven with strong Fire, out of a crooked vessel a strong Water, or have from these two stuffs taken only one such mixed with an Earth, and with strong Fire prepared one Water therefrom. This they have driven over several times, that no moisture was there. Then have they put the above volatile salty Liquor 1 part into a pot, as here depicted (Figure 18).

Then they have put a vessel with a spoon to the beak, and have driven a Phytonis spirit thereover. When the half also had flown over, they then have taken off the Vessel, the remainder they have thrown away, the Spirit which flew up, they rectified once, and have gotten a mysterious Liquor, with which they have gone to work. Others have taken the above fiery salty Liquor, of which 1 part, and added of Water Gaza the half, then driven it over, and have also successfully proceeded, and have then also got the Spirit Phytonis, as a key to the Art, then have they taken our Matter, it is Bismuth or Cobalt, and beat it small, put it into a vessel; Of this secret Liquor poured thereon, to the height of 2 diagonal hands over the matter, and place this in a mild heat, continued till the Liquor is coloured grass green, the tinged Liquor is poured off, and fresh liquor is poured on, so have they got a grass green Liquor and again a green Solution; these tinged Liquors they have put together into a vessel, and driven it over to the half, the remainder have they put in a cool place, so have the stones crystallized, as Samaragdine. These they have taken out, the Liquor again drawn off to the half. Placed the vessel in a cool place, then are yet more crystals crystallized. Then have they made this secret Salt dry, and placed in a crooked vessel, and laid this in an Oven, that the Fire should beat around it, and then drive out with strong Fire a volatile Spirit with an Oil, so has the Spirit gone over in a horrible Wind. For that reason they have luted a great ball in front of the crooked necked vessel; the ball have they taken away, and there remained behind for them an Alinnegra; then they have poured the Liquor back upon the matter, and replaced the ball, and driven over the Liquor again; and this they have repeated 9 or 10 times. Then they have taken off the ball with the Liquor, and separated into 2 parts, and purified it well, then they have obtained a white and high yellow Spirit; with the white they have washed the Alingel, and poured the white Spirit thereon, and well mixed them together, placed in a mild heat, and then the Spiritus Phytonis becomes a blood red colour; this they have poured off, and poured on the above mentioned high yellow Liquor; and the other on the Latonem, and so long washed, till all redness has been drawn out of it; and that which remained behind was beautiful white, this they have well preserved. They have poured together all the red Liquor, and the white Spirit in a high vessel was driven off, till a thick blood came over. This they have put aside, and then they have caused yet more to fly, from the flown over Bird, that all watery moisture was separated therefrom. Then have they calcined the remaining Earth. And with the Phlegma drawn out a Salt, which they purified, and then they rubbed therein the Blood of the Ancients (which is http://www.rexresearch.com/abrelzar/abrelzar.htm\r (38 of 73)12/04/2008 11.59.07"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"Abraham Eleazar: The Book of Abraham the Jew (Alchemy)more precious than Ophiris Sol) placed into a crooked necked vessel, and poured the flying Bird thereon, and then distilled and cohobated.

Then are such carried off, as I taught you before, already dear brethren, because all the after work is one and the same. But as you see the preliminary works, as you see, are different. Dear brethren, there have been some of the Ancients who worked thus; they have taken this green Lion, and shut it up in an Alingel, i.e., a long necked vessel, and put in horse-dung, or otherwise in a mild vaporous heat, that it should be resolved.

For in the wet way, you should also know that with the prepared Liquor they attacked the Phytoni; because they had not all the knowledge of this our marvelous Materie, and also they have taken the Phyton, and put it into a high vessel, and poured thereon of the flying serpent, and put a head onto the vessel, placed the vessel in sand, and so has the flying dragon eaten the creeping reptile, and disintegrated it.

This have they let mount yet per se in a well secured vessel, that all remaining watery moisture should be separated, and so get its strength, fiery and clear, as a tear from the eye. With this Liquor have they also been able to do wonders, and have given it divers names. With such Liquor have they also gone to work: They have taken Ophiris Sol, and beat it into thin leaves, and put it into an Alingel and poured so much of the Water thereon, as they thought to be enough. Then have they placed this in a mild heat, so has this fiery Spirit consumed the Sol, and disintegrated it into Blood. There has the King lain in is Blood, and his limbs sunk to the bottom. Then have they poured off this Red Liquor, and from their Spiritual Liquor of Columba Dianae poured yet more thereon till the Blood was decocted. Then have they poured such into a high glass (Figure 20). Figure 20Then they put a head thereon, and Lente distilled over the flying reptile, till it became a dry Liquor. This they have put in an Alingel well secured, some have put this Liquor into a crooked Vessel, thus (Figure 21): http://www.rexresearch.com/abrelzar/abrelzar.htm\r (40 of 73)12/04/2008 11.59.07"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"Abraham Eleazar: The Book of Abraham the Jew (Alchemy) Figure 21And put it into an Oven in sand, and distill this over and Cohobate it, and so have they got the true Oil of Sol and so have they received a great Mysterium.

Then they took it out, and poured of the other portion, 1 portion thereon, and closed the vessel again, and put again into the oven, and let it stand until it was again firm. Then they took it out, and poured the remainder thereon, and this they continued till the remainder was all firm and together, so they found a fiery firm Oil. Then they caused to flow 4 shekels of Ophiris Sol, and poured 1 shekel heavy of this Oil thereon, and thus charged the Oil and the Sol into a Red Tincture, like a Burnt Blood in appearance. Of this they took a single grain of this Tincture to 16 shekels heavy of other metals, and so they got the most beautiful Sol. Dear brethren, others who from God the Lord endowed with more wisdom, took their Phyton which now had wings, and shut it up in the Sol; the Solution they poured off, for their Columba Dianae was nothing strange to the Sol, and then weighted it, and of together 8 shekels heavy, so they placed thereto also the common Phyton, which must be however pure.

Others, who saw yet a nearer way, poured the Columba Dianae on pure Luna, and dissolved it in such. This heavy Water they lifted up.

Afterwards now the dear Ancients did in such a way, help themselves many time sin need, as also their brethren, but how would they have wished t remain in such need, if the highest had not helped? Therefore, dear brethren, have I disclosed unto you anew a great secret, that you might find a consolation for one cannot have everywhere, what one desires in time of need. That it may not fail you in your grief and misery, till the deliverance comes according t the words of the Lord. Deni, Adonai, Bocitto, Ochysche in quick time. Persevere and guard yourselves that you do not unite with the heathen. Be not disconsolate without Elias and Our King, to collect again the heathen to you, to destroy them, as some of our brethren did, with whom need made them bad, that of them often 1000 have fallen in one day as by Barchoceta. This one thought because he also understood this Science, how one should prepare the Mysterium, and to the people to prepare a dreadful poisonous Water, thus, you must take Pirtre Kaly Pyton Puvon Salt Earth, out of this he taught the people to make a poisonous Water, and they made by Cohobating such a horrible fume of poison thereby. This they poured into Springs, and it was thick, dark and muddy in the heaven. They poured the same into a vessel, they put the same in profusion to the Fire, so it began to smoke, and poisoned also the Air, that men and beasts perished, than there came such a frightful illness among the people. That they got dreadful burning blisters, which then began to putrefy and to stink, many became pitch black, and fell suddenly down. If it came into a house, the poison raged so strongly, that no escape was at hand. Guard yourself, I say yet again, guard yourself from the like, that you do not make the burden heavier among you. Would you walk in the commandment of you God, so will he guard you, and send a speedy deliverance. Rely upon Him who made heaven, and earth. Hope and wait in patience. Guard yourself from errors.

This is even truly a prototype of your servitude. The Lord, the Holy One however will soon conduct us home, when the other seven years of affliction are past. We must suffer with Leah the weeks of affliction yet a short time, then will Rachel be brought to us. Consider that Ephraim is the first born of Rachel and not Judah. Therefore are we forsaken, and the Lord calls Jeremiah, V. 30:20.

Dear brethren, to give you yet a consolation till then, and to cheer you, have I again drawn a figure in order to impress on you right deeply the secrets. You see an Old hollow Oak-tree standing in a garden around which is twisted a rose bush with red roses, which has gilt leaves. Underneath from the stem of the tree runs a Lunar white Water. There are some who not far from this have hoed and digged, but found nothing; except those who by the way, who contemplated the weight. Dear brethren the old tree is our black and heavy rocky lumps of our Albaon. You must strike this rock, till it gives Water, as you have already previously with all circumstances been instructed and taught. For the Lunar white Water, which flows underneath from the tree, is our Phyton Columba Dianae, which is heavy. That however the tree bears red rose with gilt leaves, such signified the Blood of the Old One, which http://www.rexresearch.com/abrelzar/abrelzar.htm\r (44 of 73)12/04/2008 11.59.07"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"Abraham Eleazar: The Book of Abraham the Jew (Alchemy)must be drawn out of such visibly, as the Blood of the Lion, or our secret.

For it is easy, certainly not to all men; for many have such a weak understanding, that it is impossible to comprehend it. To some others however it is only Child’s play. What do you suppose indeed? Should Moses and also his brother Aaron not understand the same? Yes! For how could he turn the Golden Calf into ashes? Exodus 32. The Spirit of the Lord was on him, for he even saw before, how the holy Adonai created heaven and earth, and from what, and how this efficient Spirit yet hovers before his eyes. This intelligible Spirit now, which was the life of all things, Moses took and consumed by fire the Calf, and made I into powder. Also Miriam, Moses’ sister, because she was leprous, was cleansed by the help of this secret. And this was to the Ancients in their need the greatest consolation. This secret was, it is true, also known to the heathen through carelessness, but it has vanished again from their hands. Therefore I ask you that you do not slight my warning from their hands. Therefore I ask you that you do not slight my warning and such, and where and how you can conceal it, that it be not lost. It is in Roman, but the most is described in the Arabian tongue, that it be not read and understood by every one.

So have the Ancients also had a Water; 1 Kings, Chapter 18; which they poured on the sacrifices, then such has taken fire. Such Water have also some had in a dry form. Now this is true of Elias, when he will come with the messiah, God’s and David’s son be found again, for it lies yet concealed at Jerusalem, as I said in the beginning. That you may know, however, how this was prepared, and can be prepared, now observe. You must understand Nature, otherwise, it will be to you incomprehensible. One finds a Salt, which then burns, it is the Nitre, this must be cleansed by means of dissolving and coagulating, it must twice be precipitated from a Solution of Spiritus Vini Rectified, in order that all incombustible mucus be taken therefrom; which in all its parts,, the truest, yes a pure Fire. It is prepared from the Earth, and is to be found everywhere. It is not the Universal Salt of the Earth, but it is quite another; yet it has much in common with the same; the most of it is found in the earth, where animals as sheep, etc., have their standing place. From such a Salt have they driven out with great care a fiery red Spirit, this they have poured on Pyrtre, which is pure and clear, and so long cohobated and distilled, by means of a crooked necked vessel, till the Pyrtre has become a Water with it (Figure 30). Figure 30This they have poured again on such a fresh Salt, and so it has become a thick liquor. This they have once driven over, and again poured it back, so that it has become a thick Liquor. When this stands in the cold, it will coagulate. Of this they have taken 1 portion, and put thereto 1 portion of Naptha, in a vessel of burnt stone, for it grows very hot, and so it is prepared, and on everything that it is poured on, is eaten and consumed by fire, for no Water can exterminate it. For that reason take care, that nothing of this preparation comes in contact with yourself, for it consumes flesh and bone. Should however some of this touch you, then take only Earth mixed with Salt, and moisten this, that it becomes like a jelly and apply this, so out http://www.rexresearch.com/abrelzar/abrelzar.htm\r (50 of 73)12/04/2008 11.59.07"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"Abraham Eleazar: The Book of Abraham the Jew (Alchemy)will be putout, otherwise nothing in the World can extinguish this.

What however concerns the said Oil, will be found at the time, when the Lord collects us again in our Land. For our fathers, priests and Levites have for such a time of need prepared. For no sanctuary, so we also require no holy consecrated Oil, for the finery is taken from Israel. Yet that you might know, what this Oil is for, and whereof it is prepared, so mark; The Ancients took a vessel of Acures or a vessel of stone, covered with Acures, and placed this on a Fire of coal which did not scorch or give flames, and put 32 shekels heavy of god Olive Oil therein, when this became hot, then they have on hand tender, bruised and rubbed Myrrh, Cinnamon, Calamus, Cassia, of each 8 shekels heavy, this they stirred amongst each other, and let it stand well muffled up, that the strength may remain together for 1/4 of an hour. And then they took this from the Fire and allowed it to cool, and then squeezed the Balsam through a new virgin cloth and preserved it in a clean vessel. Herewith were the Kings and Priests anointed. Guard yourself however, that none understand how to make this ointment; he must be a Priest or from a priestly caste. Exodus 30. God the Lord has forbidden it, so none dare to fabricate this holy ointment Oil of the bridegroom, but only a priest, who used it at marriages, when two betrothed persons appeared to the Priest, so was the bridegroom anointed with this Oil together with the blessing of Jacob. All our brethren have also received the anointing that their matrimonial state may be blessed, and they become fruitful, for we are all children of the Holy One. This ointment Oil was prepared out of 32 shekels of Olive Oil, 12 shekels heavy Myrrh, of Aloe and Cassia, 8 shekels heavy, Exodus 20. This then the Priests preserved also in a pure and holy place. With this they anointed also the sick and blessed them, so they became often better or died. Were they not anointed before death, then the Priest, after death anointed them as well on forehead as on breast. Dear brethren, out of what the perfume consisted, you shall also know. The ancients have also put it together. They have taken Stacte, Onycha, Galbanum and Frankincense amalgam and such also preserved. Exodus 30.

Secondly, that such Flower is born in Air signifies that it mounts on the mountains, i.e., into the Alembic. That is the Columba Dianae and is at first all there is found and seen.

The fiery dragons are the Phyton or unveiled Dianae (Figure 31) Figure 31That nobody knows here, as well in the wet as the dry way. So can also with the help of the Universal Chaos of the Ancients, like from the Salt Aerum of the Magnetic fatness of the Air this fiery Dragon be understood, with which the Ancients did wonders, and this they have learned from Moses. The Griffins are, as previously mentioned, nothing other than Spirtus Phytonis, which can be prepared as well from the old Albaon, as also from the Chaos Universali; from men and Vines (Figure 32). http://www.rexresearch.com/abrelzar/abrelzar.htm\r (54 of 73)12/04/2008 11.59.07"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"Abraham Eleazar: The Book of Abraham the Jew (Alchemy) Figure 32With which they mixed some Mineral spirits and from such they prepared a volatile Spirit, with which they burnt off the wings of the Phyton, and have metamorphosed into a viscous Water.

The bristles stick to a cross piece of wood, this put into a vessel, which you can well close; and place it in a mild heat (Figure 33) so they will become in a short time as hard, as they have been, and of great brilliancy. Take these out and steep them into the Liquor prepared from the Columba Dianae, and let them be wiped clean, then put them again into a glass, and in a mild heat, the others in a short time will surpass. You can also cause forms to be made with divers figures, as birds, lambkins, pears, apples and the like, besides that, you can prepare pearls of priceless value. http://www.rexresearch.com/abrelzar/abrelzar.htm\r (55 of 73)12/04/2008 11.59.07"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"Abraham Eleazar: The Book of Abraham the Jew (Alchemy) Figure 33For one is not everywhere in the position Sol and Luna to expose to sight, for the enemies sake, because if they became conscious of it, they would torment us badly. For consolation in your misfortune have I disclosed this. One can carry such a pearl himself, and conceal and yet be of great value. The Ancients have yet further looked about in nature. If they had precious stones, which had not got their mature and right colour so have they quickly known, such to bring to sight. If they have had a Diamond, which was large and not pure, they have cleansed it from all dirt, and put it into a vessel, and poured thereupon the Columba Dianae, and let them stand with each other in a mild heat, and then has it received its pureness and beauty. Others have, however, taken the Columba Dianae in dry form, rubbed gently, and put such into a vessel of good burnt Earth (Figure 34) and laid in the Diamond, and put thereto so much of the Columba Dianae that it is only covered. The vessel they have well closed, and then put it into the Fire, and let it stand some time, then have they opened the vessel, and found their Diamond surrounded with a skin. This they have separated from it, then they have found it larger and prettier. Yes they have taken only one right beautiful Crystal, and with such in this manner proceeded, this they have now performed in all secrecy.

I have again drawn a Figure, which comprehends much in itself. Give heed to it well. You see, that a King stands in the Figure with a naked sword; his soldiers are killing innocent children, and they collect the blood in a well standing thereby, which this is already filled with blood, in order to colour it yet some more. Into which descends Sol and Luna, to bathe themselves therein. This Figure has a two-fold meaning This Figure has a two-fold meaning, as well in the wet and dry way.

The first is prepared out of the Universal Chaos, the other from the Animal, Vegetable and Mineral. Particularly must you conform to my teaching, where I showed, how the Ancients therewith went to work. They have taken this fiery flying Spirit, and poured this on the Phyton, and so has it taken away from it the metallic nature, and has become a glutinous white water. With this have they further proceeded, and this Liquor they again poured on fresh Phyton, so has it also become a thick viscous water. Then have they taken the King, and dissolved it therein, then has it become red like to Blood. This Blood have they now also called the Red Lion, this have they fixed, and as I already taught you, augmented their work with this sloppy Phyton, and also found a blessed ending. Others have prepared these two Fires in their volatile form, and taken and dissolved the King with this, and distilled therefrom the flying Bird partly, to a red Liquor. This they have preserved, and put tone side, then have they also dissolved of the Diana, so have they got a blue-green water; of such have they likewise from the Liquor drawn the flying Bird in a mild heat, whereof they could not kinder, that this Spirit, as well from the King, as whose spouse should not have carried and taken something away. On this account have they poured this flying Bird with solar and lunar feathers on the Phyton, so has it again dissolved itself again in such. They have they poured off the clear Solution, and put again on a fresh Phyton, so have they got a fat and heavy Liquor, then have they the King and Queen allied with each other, and poured together. Of such have they put the half into an Alingel, and as heavy as these two weighed, poured thereon of their fatty heavy Liquor. Then in such is the beginning and efficacious and have and also http://www.rexresearch.com/abrelzar/abrelzar.htm\r (59 of 73)12/04/2008 11.59.07"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"Abraham Eleazar: The Book of Abraham the Jew (Alchemy)herewith sealed hermetically their springs, with each other well closed, and on our oven allowed to go through the colours, till such had become firm.

This have they repeated, till the Blood of the King all had been consumed. Then have they taken out their Tincture, and divided it into to two portions, the one they have caused to flow with equal parts of Ophiris Sol, and so it has become a pure Tincture. Then have they again divided this Tincture into two portions, the one portion have they kept themselves for sustenance of their life, the other have they however blended with the half of the unmelted Tincture, and rubbed amongst each other, this again put into an Alingel, moistened with the Gluten Aquillae, that it had not only become rather thickish, closed the Alingel well, and this again let it go through the colours for Fixation and this have they practiced in Infinitum. That should you know however, that this Tincture cannot be brought so high, as that described in the foregoing, which took its origin from the old Albaon, or otherwise prepared from a volatile solar material or Metallic Seed; for the Well in this Figure from which the blood red water gushes, signifies our Blood of the Old Albaon, which pure volatile Tincture is, in which Sol and Luna bathe themselves, or in which they grow young again. This Figure also signifies the inexhaustible augmentation of our great work, and is nothing other than our three beginning parts whereof our single Materia take their origin, with and through which is All in All, as well under as above the earth were born all Minerals and Metals, which Materia called by its right name, also the analysis clearly taught. Will you on this account, in all truth remember this much thereof. Our old one according to appearance is like a lead ore, but in its parts is a pure volatile Sol and Luna; it dissolves almost all its Corpus into a Water by Vitriol and Nitre prepared, which is a wonder that Vitriol can be metamorphosed; one finds also often that our Old One has white poisonous bones, which is a pure poisonous Phyton or Seed, and is here a token, that Nature seeks to make this once again volatile, for in such a form it can become no Metal; for when this comes into the open Fire, it flies all away, and leaves scarcely a little Solar Luna behind. Do not be terrified before this poisonous reptile, for this Old One lies invariable and lives, yet it is a living Materia, which breathes and exhales without ceasing it smells through a whole room, and when our Old One is triturated and brought into the smallest molecule, annexed to such and is put together into a vessel, then this poisonous serpent coalesces again; so indeed, that if it is often driven from one vessel to another, and coalesces so, that one can with no mallet can often bring from one another; and that this is such a metallic http://www.rexresearch.com/abrelzar/abrelzar.htm\r (60 of 73)12/04/2008 11.59.07"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"Abraham Eleazar: The Book of Abraham the Jew (Alchemy)Phyton or pure Seed, is shown by its high dark blue color, which with help of white sand or Quartz, or when it is mixed with powder, from the stones (as David employed it, from the brook with which he killed Goliath) so it gives in a strong fire a heavenly dark blue Acures, that also its Tincture and Strength shows itself in all places.

If this Mineral is older and has stood longer, then it has all the colours of the world, as Lunar white with violet or blue, red with golden little sparks intermixed, often quite pure. The third species is, when this in the pits begins to become white, then the colours are partly lost, and the material becomes silver grey mixed with much white. There is in this a most poisonous and pure volatile Tincture, which is well to bear in mind, and all three are of one species and from one root, only that one possesses more Tincture, than the other, yet are all three precious in the Art, and this material is a right Hermaphrodite, i.e., of masculine and feminine seed. The other Materia is also not to be thrown away, for it is almost in all its parts a pure volatile Sol seed, looks usually like pure Sol, is found also in red and yellow Marcz, in black and yellow grains, also in grey and white sand mixed with black grains, From such may it also be dissolved with a Liquor, and brought into Crystals of strange properties.

Of this Liquor now carried over, they poured 1 portion to 16 portions of Venus in flux, and got the most beautiful Sol. Then they took of this Sol 4 portions, and let it flow, and threw 1 portion of their Tincture thereon, then it became pure Tincture. This they parted into 2 portions, and put the one portion again in, and worked immediately, and were helped in their need. Others, however who were more sage, took this marvelous Salt, and brought such into a vessel, closed it and put it into a mild heat or in horse-dung, in order that it resolve itself into a grass green Liquor, which they likewise gave may marvelous names. This they now took, and brought it into a crooked necked vessel of Acures, and separated this Liquor from each other, and put it again together, as I have already taught you. This now of a simple conception was made with great trouble from this salty Liquor, as mentioned previously, with a strong Fire, which alone they made firm, and had no knowledge of the Phyton, how it has a co-agent, as Sol and Luna must be in doing this, that they also its seed gave thereto. When now that they carried their Tincture to the Venus so it indeed became also a Tincture, when however they carried this to other Metals, before they carried it to the Venus, as that previously happened to a Sol containing Venus. Here they knew not how to help themselves, and if they carried this Tincture to the Phyton, so it would not take it in, for it was yet in its combustible bodies, therefore they must be satisfied with what they had, that their work was not once satisfied.

Others now who had no Sol or Luna in readiness, yet from a mighty understanding when they prepared their double fiery spirit, they preserved such, and made, as I taught you already in the beginning, a solar Spirit in pure Water, and let such again therefrom fume, this they have repeated several times, then they poured a Spirit prepared from the Vino thereon, and extracted all solar Tincture thereout. This Spirit they now distilled again, till there remained a red Dust, on this Dust they now poured their fiery Water, and extracted it several times, then they got an auriferous Phyton, then they made with the fiery Water also from the Phyton a glutinous Liquor, and http://www.rexresearch.com/abrelzar/abrelzar.htm\r (63 of 73)12/04/2008 11.59.07"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"Abraham Eleazar: The Book of Abraham the Jew (Alchemy)poured these two together, and made this according to the Art firm; then they got an Oil Tincture on Venus in Sol. Others however made a Salt from the Mars and Venus as is taught and from this with force of the fire drove an Oil Liquor and poured these 3 in similar weight together. The Earth Virgineam so remaining, they calcined with strong Fire and commenced to carry their Tincture thereon, as is already said, and so they got a Tincture much stronger than the former, and could also easily increase this. Therefore can you see, dear brethren, when you wish to, that the All Wise King of the World has shown enough ways, to help you in your need. That however I keep nothing back, what can serve only to your well being, so have some of the Ancients also gone in the following way, for they not always would have been able to attain their purpose, and have yet understood and known the true Mineral Materia. So have they taken such, and beat small, and with this Menstruo or fiery Water dissolved its body, and prepared from the same a marvelous Salt, and have come much closer to Nature. With such a Green Lion have they gone to work, according to the above teaching, and have also obtained their purpose. Others who knew not how to help themselves, and who wanted wisdom only merely with this fiery Water unfolded Ophiris Sol into a blood red Tincture, and again mildly distilled such a fiery Water therefrom, till a red Dust remained. This Dust they have carried to other Sol standing in a red flux, and tinged such Sol with it, and transmigrated it to a brittle red Massa, with which they have brought some portions of Luna into Sol. I could, dear brethren, reveal yet more of the same secrets, but the life of man is too short, but I have only wished to show you the most secret and important ways, but I have only wished to show you the most secret and important ways, that you might have something for consolation in your oppression, in order to free your poor imprisoned brethren from the bonds of servitude, and come to the help of poor widows and orphans, and to provide for the necessitous and miserable, that you through doing will eradicate all evil. Give alms willingly, fast and pray, for such eradicates sin and releases from death. You will support yourself that you may live. Tobit 12. Hold this book even concealed, that the curse may not come on you, and you be banished from the earth. Act wisely and wait in patience.
