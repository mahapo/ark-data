ADDRESSED TO THE CANDID READER. I T would be unjust to doubt, most gentle reader, that of all the arts invented for the use of life by the reason of man, that of Akhe111y is the most noble and glorious. For all philosophers exclaim, as it were, with one voice, albeit in many languages, that this art is not only tnte, but (after the Divine Law br which our souls are saved) the best and most magnificent gift bestowed upon man by God ; and that it should therefore be investigated with all zeal and with . the greatest pains. But as good wine needs no praise, so neither docs this art require a herald ; for its truth is undoubted, and its utility in human life universally acknowledged, and shewn forth, not only in the Art of :\\[edicine, in Pharmacy, and many other sciences, but more especially in the Art of Trans-muting Metals, is so clearly and perspicuouslr demonstrated, that it in no way requires to be adorned by the splendour of oratory, or tricked out with the de\\'ice of langua;::e. I will not enlar~e upon the blessing which the elaboration of minerals and metals has b::stowed upon our race. I. merely point it out~ but refrain from discussing it at length. Different men de\\·ote themseh·es to the study of this science from different moti,·es. The philosopher is impelled by the love of truth, and the thirst after wisdom. He delights in knowledge for its own sake. He .

He has at his .command the most effectual means of becoming rich, if he would only use them. nut he is fired by the love of philosophy, and docs not care for the mocking grandeur of fortune. So thought the Sages of the Saracens, Egyptians, Arabs, and Persians ; for , when they were oppressed by tyrants, and violently driven into exile, they protected and. supported themselves by means of , 1 their Art, and, through their knowledge· of the transmutation ·of metals, they had at their command, not only sufficient to live upon, but all the comforts and pomp of life, and thus practically demonstrated that they could obtain all that gold and silver could give. Concerning this true transmutation of metals, which is accomplished only by the Elixir or Stone of the Philosophers, we here propose to speak. This art is set forth in a series of treatises by different authors, which appeared several years ago, and, like the present volume, was entitled ''A l\\luseum of Hermes.\" But many writers h:1ving discussed this subject, and treated it from various points of view (so that one writes more clearly than another, and each throws light on the other's meaning), some of my friends, who arc adepts in this Art, urged me to add to the former collection certain treatises supplementary of those already given. For though that foriner collection contained the most select writings on the subject, yet it was not as complete as it mi~ht have been, nor was it calculated to furnish to the 'reader in full measure the eagerly expected fruit of his study. To this wish of my friends I have all the more readily submitted, because its fulfilment must redound to the advantage of the student. I have, therefore, enlarged the collection with several most select treatises, and · caused it to be adorned with many engravings. I was most strongly impelled to undertake the task by this consideration, viz.,· that through the fraudulent machinations of greedy impostors many false, so-called chemical treatises ha\\·e been put forward, in which there is not a sin~le spark of truth, and that very many ha,·e been, and arc still beiitg deceived by them.

For in this book all errors arc shewn up and dispelled. For this reason 1 confidently offer this volume to the sons of knowledge, in order that while they think upon and im·estigatc the secret working of Nature, they may obtain from it nothing but the truth, and gain a clear insi~ht into the very nature of things. In this alone consists the perfection of the en~irc most Holy Art of Philosophy. Only let them go fom·ard along the Royal Road . which Nature prescribes in all her operations. As to the rest, 1 heartily beg the friends of this Art to give a kindly reception to the present volume, and when, through the \\\\'ill of God, by constant labour, they have put ashore in the . desired haven of philosophy, after the manner of philosophers to exclude all that arc unworthy from the knowledge thereof, and, being mindful of charity towards their need)' neighbour in the fear of God (without any vain ostentation), to sing etemal praises to the Good and Thrice Great God for this \\V ondcrful and Divine Gift (without any abuse thereof) in a silent a·nd devoutly joyful heart.

WORTHY reader, and true enquirer into the secrets of nature, marvel not that in the old age of this world, when it seems to ha\\'e one foot already in the grave, I ha\\'e determined to write this tract. although all libraries arc already full or books on this subject-or which, however, the greater part are false, and wear merely the rouge and powder of philosophy. I ha\\'e written it not fi>r my own pleasure, but for your advantage, . that, by pointing to the foundation or truth, 1 might lead you back from the pathless wilderness into the right way-which is certainly for your own interest. As far as I am concerned, I ha\\'C long known all that I seck to know in regard to this matter, and ha\\'e no need of many books, seeing that during the last twenty-two years I ha\\'C read and re-read all the works that fell into my hands-in· eluding numerous manuscripts, as well as many printed \\'olumcs. In this my tract you will find the subject set forth, and the true solution gi\\'en, not only theoretically, but also from a practical and allegorical point of view, with a clearness and lucidity such as I belie\\'e to be almost unparalleled in any prev-ious philosophical treatise. In quoting, I ha\\'e always been care-ful to give the exact reference, so that )'OU may 1.()(\\k out the passage for yourself, and by diligently considering it, sharpen your understanding. 1 could more easily have composed . this treatise, and made myself known to the Brethren of the Golden Digitized by Coogle"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"8 THE HERMETIC MUSEUM.

I have come fonvard, not for the sake or any paltry glory, or or worldly praise, but to do you good. Moreover, my teachers, even the true: philosophers, advised me not thus to risk my life for the sake of obtaining a high place in the world's esteem, to expose myself to greedy robbers or to give occasion for many crimes by the prostitution of this pro· found secret No doubtthe gentle reader has learned by the works of Sendivogius that whenever he shewed himself openly to the powerful, he went in constant fear of his life. Experience teaches that many philosophers who gave no thought to their personal safety, have been killed and deprived oftheirtinctureby greedy and powerful robbers ; and it stands to reason that any one goin~ about with a great treasure in his hand, must fall a prey to brigands. Sendi\\'(>Rius concealed his name by an anagram. Thus also a short time ago another philosopher and Brother of the Golden Cross, whose real name has long been familiar to me, concealed it beneath an anagram, and made himself known to his friends by an enigmatical designation. \\\\\"hy then should I place myself at the mercy of this impure world ? l'ermit me rather, dear friend, to follow the example ofthe sages, and leave the rest to the thrice good and great God, who will m~ke my true self known to you in good time, if it be for the glory of II is name, and for your and my good. · Do not be eager to enquire after my name. For e\\·en if )'OU should get to know it, or become personally acquainted with me, )'OU would have to rest satisfied with the contents of this tract. For I have solemnly promised two philosophers..-Bemard, Count of Trevisan, and Neigens-that I will not betray to any one more than has been re\\·ealed in this book.

To some foolish and shallow persons I have several times expounded this Art in the simplest manner, and e\\·en word for word, but they despised it only, and would not believe me that there is exhibited in our work a twofold resur-rection of the dead. Our Art, its theory as well as its practice, is altogether a gift of God, \\\\'ho gives it when and to whom lie elects : it is not of him that wills, or of him that runs, but simply through the mercy of God. Thou~h I had diligently studied this Art for 17 or 18 years, yat I had, after all, to wait for God's own time, and accept it as a free gift. I\\o one need doubt the truth or certainty of this Art. It is as true and certain, and a'> surely ordained by God in nature, as it is that the sun shines at noon-tide, and the moon shews her soft splendour at night.

As concerns the Matter, it is Olte, and contains within itself all that is needed. Out of it the artist prepares whatever he wants. Its \"Hirth is in the sand,\" aa the philosopher Anastratus says in \"The Crowd \" : \" Nothing is more precious than the red sand of the sea ; ·it is the distilled moisture of the 1\\foon joined to the light of the Sun, and congealed.\" That only this one substance is required is attested by Agadmon in the same book. He says : \" Know that unless you take my body ........-[sulphur] without the spirit [mercury] ye will not obtain what ye desire. Cease to think of many things. Nature is satisfied with one thing, and he who docs not know it is lost.\" In the same way Arnotd, of Villa Nova, writes in his \" Flower of Flowers\" : \"Our stone is made out of one thing, · ~ and with one thing.\" To the same effect he says to the King of Naples: \"All that is in our stone is essential to it, nor docs -it need any foreign ingredient. Its nature io; one, and it is o1re thing.\" And Rosinus says : \" Know that the object of your desire is one thing, out of which all things arc made.\" Lilium : \" You have need only of one thing, which at any stage of our experiment can be changed into another nature.\" So Geber says in his \"Summary\" : \"Our stone is one, one medicine, to which we add nothing, from which we take nothing away, only removing that which is superfluous.\" Again, Scitcs in \" The Crowd \" says: \"The essence of this Art. is in like manner a certain one thing which is stronger and more exalted than all other things, and is called the. most powerful acid, because it changes gold into a clear spirit, without which there is neither whiteness, nor blackness, nor redness. When the spirit is joined to the body it becomes one with it ; and yet again becomes a spirit, and is saturated with the spiritual and unchangeable tincture, and thus again by combination receives a hodily tincture which cannot be annihilated. If you place the body without the acid over the fire, it will be burnt and destroyed.\" From these words of Scitcs the reader might conclude, that not one but two things, namely a body and an acid (as he calls it) arc required, and that a liquid must be combined with a dry thing Jest the dry thing should be consumed by the fire, in order that Digitized by Coogle"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"THE GOLDEN TRACT. IJ by the moist thing it may be preserved from such combustion. To such a conclusion, if nghtly accepted, I gladly subscribe. But from the above mentioned philosophical dicta (howcvcrobscun:ly worded they may be) it is clearer than day that the substance of -our Blessed Stone is o11e 1although different sage~ call it by different names), and that Nature has made it ready to the hand o( the adept, having willed this one thing, and no other thing in all the world, to be the material o( the Stone. This !\\latter lies before the eyes o( all; everybody sees it, touches it, loves it, but knows it not. It is glorious and vile, precious and of small account, and is found C\\'erywhere. Thcophr.lstus J>aracclsus. in his book concerning \" The Tincture o( Physical Things.'' calls it the Red Lion, which is named by many, but known by few. Hermes, in the first chapter of his Treatise, calls it \"Quick Sil\\'er coagulated in its innermost chambers.\" In the \" Rosary of the Philosophers\" it goes by the name of Salt. But, to be brief, our Matter has as many names as there arc things in the world ; that is why the foolish kn<'W it not. Foolish I call those who, without any pre\\·ious knowledge of Nature and her' properties, undertake to learn this Art, and come to it (as Arnold says) like the ass to the crib, not knowin~ for what they open their mouths. Hence it is well said by Geber, in the \"Sum o( Perfection\": \" lie who has no elementary knowledge of ~atun: is far from a proper appreciation of this Art.\" And Rosarius says : \" I ad\\·isc no one to approach this Art unless. he kno\\\\·s the principle and the regimen of Nature: if he be acqpaint1.-d with these, little is wantin~ to him except one thing, nor n~ed he put himself to. a great expense, since the stone is one, the medicine is one, the vessel one, the rule one, the disposition one.\" Yet this one substance is so di\\'idad by the operation of I Nature, and the skill of the Artist, that it is transmuted into our• 1 White Eagle, nor docs the splendour of the sun illuminate rriore abundantly the spagyric matter with its beams ; or, as Uasilius Valentinus hath it, that, \"thence is born a spirit. white as st:ow, and another spirit red as blood, which two spirits arc contained in a third hidden thing.\" Hence King Aros well says: \"Our medicine is composed out of two things hai:ingone essence, namely, through the mercurial union of a solid and a liquid, a spiritual and a corporeal, a cold and a moist, a warm and a dry, and in Digitized by Coogle"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"14 THE HERMETIC MUSEUM. -·-no othet way can it be made!' And Richard the Englishman says: \"The stone is one, the medicine one, which, however, according to the philosophers, is called Rebis (Two-thing), ._.. being composed of two things, namely, a body and spi'rit[rc~ or w_l!ite]. But over this many foolish persons have gone astray, explaining it in divers ways.\" Rebis is two things, and these two things arc one thing, namely, w_l!!_er joined to a body, l:ly which the body is dissolved into a spirit, that is, mineral water, 1 out of which it was first made ; and this ~y and spirit make up one mineral water, which is called Elixir, that is to say, ferment ; for then water and spirit arc one thing; of which is composed a tincture and medicine for purging all bodies. And thus, according to the philosophers, we have the nature of !?Uiphur -/_. and mercury above ground, while underground they become gold and silver. Bernard, Count of Trevisan and the 1\\larch, says : ''Our work is performed by means of one root, and two crude mercurial substances, drawn and extracted from a mineral, pure and clear, being conjoined by the heat of friendship, as this matter requires, and carefully cooked until the two things become one thing,\" &c. Basilius Valentinus (Lib. Nat. et Stl/'(rllal., c. 4) says : \" I will make this known to thee in all truth rfor the love of God), that the root of philosophic sulphur, which is a heavenly spirit, is united in thc·samc material with the root ·of the spiritual and supernatural mercury, and the principle of spiritual salt-out of which is made the Stone, and not out of several things. That universal thing, the greatest treasure of earthly wisdom, is one thing, and the principles of three things arc found in one, which has power to ·change all metals into one. The three things arc the true spirit of mercury, and the soul of sulphur,. united to spiritual salt, and dwelling in one body ; they arc dragon and eagle, king and lion, spirit and body, etc.\" In this way our prepared material is also called male and female, active and passive. So Zimon says; in \" The Crowd \" : \" Know that the secret of the work consists in male and female, i.e., an active and a passive principle. In lead is found the male, in orpimcrit the female. The male rejoices when the female is brought to it; and the female receives from the male a tinging seed, and is coloured thereby.\" And Diomcdcs says: \"Join the Digitized by Coogle ; I i I I I l I l l I"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"THE GOLDEN TRACT. male child of the • red servant ' to the fragrant spouse, and they will produce the object of our Art. Hut you must not introduce any foreign matter, neither dust, nor any other thing. The con-ception will then be perfect, and a true son will be born. Oh, how precious is the nature of the • red servant,' without whom nothing can be effected!\" Others call it quicksilver, or mercury, and sulphur, or fire, <\\S Roger Hacon says, in the third chapter of his \"1\\lirror \": \" Out of sulphur and mercury arc all metals, ~, and nothing adheres to them, neither is joined to them, or trans-mutes them, but what is of them. And thus we must accept 1 mercury and sulphur as the matter of the stone.\" So also Mcnabadus says: \" He who joins quicksih·er to the body of m<~gncsia, and the woman to the man, extracts the secret essence by which boc.lics arc coloured.\" Lullius in his \" Cndicil \" says: \" The property of our mercury is to be coagulated by its sulphur.\" And, in the l'racticc of Iris Testament: \"The sih·cr is a flowing moisture, floating above and preserving the whole from combustion.\" Others usc the names, body, spirit, and soul. Thus Arnold, in his \" Flower of Flowers,\" says: \" The Sages ha\\·e affirmed that our Stone is composed of body, soul, and spirit, and they have spoken truly. For the imperfect part they ha\\·c compared to a body, because it is weak The water they have called spirit, and truly, because it is spirit. The ferment they ha\\·e termed soul, because it gives life to the imperfect body (which before was dead), and makes its form more beautiful.\" Again, he says : \" A spirit is nc\\·cr joined to a body but by the interposition of a soul. For the soul is the medium between body and spirit, joining them together.\" 1\\lorienus says: \" The soul quickly enters its own body-but if )·ou tried to join it to a foreign body, you would labour in \\·ain.\" And Lilium says: \" Body, soul, and spirit make up one thing, which has all iil it-. self, and to wf1ich nothing is added.''

And first, as concerns the search after our Matter, we should remember that In the beginning, when there was nothing but Himself, God, who is infinite in wisdom, created two classes of things, namely, those that arc In heaven, and those that are under heaven. The heavenly things (about which we need not here speak at length) arc the heavens themselves, and the dwellers in heaven. The things that arc under the heavens were created out of four clements, and arc commonly divided into three classes. Those that live and feel hold the first place, and arc called animals. The second class arc the plants, that grow out of the earth, but do not feel. The third class, that of the minerals, has its origin underground. These three classes include all that (beneath the moon) has been created out ofthc clements. They can never become more or less, and God has bound each thing to its own genus and species, so that it cannot change from one genu$ .to another. If any one tried to make a man or a tree out of a stone, or a monkey or lead out of a plant, or an animal or a plant out· of lead, he would be prevented from doing so by the eternal order of the Great King. If such a thing were possible, all classes of natural objects could be changed into one. Hut, because such a change would put an end to the world, the Ruler of the Universe docs not penni~ it. Nay, what is more, He not only restricted cverythin~ to its own kind, but gave each created thing its own seed, by which it might be propagated after its own manner-always rcmaini\"ng in its own class, and not O\\'Crstcpping the bounds of some other species. If any one wished to change a man into a horse, an apple into a lettuce, a diamond or any other jewel into gold, he would make an enormous mistake. For such an attempt would be against the nature of sublunar things. And as it was in the beginning so it shall be in the end, when the Almighty, who in the beginning said \" Let it be,\" shall say •• Let it perish.'' But among those things which have a common substance, seed, and elementary compositior., it is not difficult to accomplish an amelioration and improvement, by the puri-fication of their matter. So we may sec a man of a clear and subtle mind attain to a higher degree of human excellence than others who arc less gifted.

Concern-ing this common substance. Rich:ud the Englishman has the following words : \"Xaturc has elaborated all kinds of fusible things by a natural process out of mercury, and the substance of its sulphur, because it is the property of quicksilver to be con-solidated by steam, as by the heat of white and red sulphur which docs not burn.\" The same view is expressed by Arnold (pt. 1., cp. ii.) : ' \" Quicksih·cr is the elementary form of all things fusible ; .for all things fusible, when melted, arc changed into it, and it mingles with them because it is of the same substance with them. Such bodies differ from quicksih·cr in their composition only so far a! itself is or is not free from the foreign matter of impure sulphur.\" Similarly Rosin us (Ad Stmlltwltlm) savs:\" The substance of all . metals in the heart of the earth is solidified and imperfect quick-:;ih·cr; for by the quickening heat of sulphur different metals (according to the d!fferent \\'arietics of sulphur) arc gcncratcc.l i11 the earth ; their original :;ubstancc is cnc and the same, and is modified only by a ~reatcr or smaller external influence.'' lienee we sec daily how busily Xaturc is occupied in bringing them to mortification and perfection.

In most cases ~old is dug out pure, clear, free from dross, · and unmixed with any other metals. Hut most frequently a large quantity of foreign sulphur mirigles with the quicksih·er, and thus prevents its perfect devcJc,pment ; and, according to the variety of that sulphur, different kinds of metals arc generated, as Aristotle says (4. 1\\Icteor.) : \" If the quicksilver be of a goo1 substance but the .sulphur impure and combustible, it changes the quicksilver into' brass. If the quicksih·cr be stony, impure, and earthy, and the ~ulphur not pure, it becomes iron. Tin seems to have good and pure quick-silver; but the sulphur is bad and not well mixed. Lead has gross, bad, and ill-smclli'ng quicksilver, and is thus not properly coagulated.\" · That retarding, combustible, and fretid sulphur is not the tntc fire that fashions metals ; but quicksih·cr has its own sulphur in itself, which is sufficient for the purpose of fashioning it, as Bernard, Count of Trevisan, says: \" Some believe that in the generation of metals, a sulphuric substance is introduced from without ; but, on the contritry, it is clear that in the work-ing of Nature sulphur is already enclosed in the mercury. Yet it has no power in it except through t~te moving heat, by which the said sulphur is changed, and with it two other qualities of the mercury. In this way, then, Nature generates by means of this sulphur the different kinds of metals in the veins of the earth, according to the diversity of degrees and alterations.'' For in metals, according to Arnold (P,t. J., cp. iii.), \"there is a two-fold superfluity : one that is enclosed in the innermost nature of the quicksilver, and got there at the first mingling of the metal ; the other docs not belong to the essence of it, is external to it, and corruptible. To remove the former is a difficult task; the latter may be removed without any difficulty. The combustible sulphur is taken away by being subjected to the action of fire, or is destroyed by foreign bodies ; but the other, which is in the quicksilver, is preserved by it from combustion.\" But again, that inward sulphur. which fashions the quicksilver belonging to it, and matures it towards perfection, is either pure or impure, combustible or incombustible.

I thou~ht it would be best, 0 friendly searcher of Nature, to discuss the matter more in detail, in order that you might the more readily know and make usc of the substance of our Stone ! For if you attempted to produc~ our Stone out of an animal substance you would fail, because the two things bclon:,: to different natural ordqs.

And Basil. Valentinus says: '' Consider aud know, my friend, that y.ou must not select an animal soul for this your purpose.

Second, since the lesser minerals cannot be-come the olcmentary substance of metals, which is mercury, they can nevc.r reach the middle and the end of the same develop· mcnt, namclr, metals and the tincture~ But because the pro· pcrtics of the lesser minerals are foreign to those of the metals, although they· may ha\\'C some of the \\'irtues of minerals, yet on the whole they arc less excellent and arc liable to be injured by fire. Therefore the nature of metals delights not in them, but repels them, while it receives that which is suited to it. For this reason they arc foohsh who bring in so many foreign specula-tions for the purpose of imposing upon their hearers ; for the things they put forward arc altogether unlike metals ami can never rccch·c nor impart their nature.'' The student must not suffer himself to be misled by the language occasionally employed with regard to salts by th..: philosophers whom we have quoted, as, for instance, when it is said, in the mystic language of our Sages, \" H c who works with-out salt will nc\\·cr raise dead bodies\"; or, again, when he reads in the book of Soliloquies,\" He \\vho works without salt draws a bow without a string.\" For you must know that these sayings refer to a \\'cry different kind of salt from the common mineral. This you may sec from the following passage of the \" Rosary of the t>hiJosophcrs\": \" The salt of metals is the l'hilosophcr's Stone ; for our Stone is water congealed in gold and sih·cr ; it is hostile to fire and may be dissolved into the water of which it is composed after its kind.\" And that the \"congealed water\" of the Sages docs not mean ordinary water may be gathered from the following words of Gcbcr (lib. foro., cp. xix.): \"Seck to resolve the sun and the moon into their dry water, which the vulgar call mercury.\" The Sages have also described their earth under the name of salt-e.,!,'\"., in the \"Sounding of the Trumpet,\" where it is said : •• That which is left at the bottom of the dis-tilling vessel is our salt-that is to s;;)', our earth.\" :\\nd in the \"Allegories of the Wise '' one bursts forth into these words: •• !\\[ark well that those bodies which now forth from our bodies arc salts and alums.\" At times they call the medicine itself Digitized by Coogle"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"THE GOLDEN TRACT. 23 \" Salt,\" as in the following passage of the \" Scale \" : \"The virtue of the second water is to exalt earth into its own mineral salt, as though assimilating it by its own strength.\" And Arnold, in his work concerning the \"l'rescn·ation of Youth,\" (lib. iii.) s::.ys: \" This prepared salt has great virtue in preserving youth. The Sages have compared it to the natural heat of healthy youth. The Stone itself has sometimes been called by the wise the Animal Stone, sometimes the l\\lincral Secret, on account of this similitude; sometimes the Everlasting Remedy, or the Water of Life. The whole preparation may be reduced to the purest drinking water, like other things that ha\\·c the same properties.\" From the aforesaid it cl<'arly appears that we arc forbidden both by the teaching of the Sages and by the nature of the thing to suppose that the Stone can be made out of the lesser minerals. We should next enquire more carefully whcth<'r'thc matter of our Stone may be obtained from the intermediate minerals-like bismuth, antimon)', magnesia, and so on. They arc certainly often mentioned in this connection by the Sages. Thus Senior says, in a certain passage : \" If yellow orpimcnt has not the power of coagulating mercury our !\\lagistcry can nc\\·er attain its goal.'' Thomas de Aquinas recommends us to take \"our antimony, or black earth,\" while l'armcnides, in \"The Crowd,'' says:\" Take quicksilver and coagu~atc it in the body of magnesia, or cor-ruptible sulphur.\" But in all such passages these terms arc used metaphorically ; it is not meant that the Great Stone can e\\'cr be made out of such substances. The orpimcnt and magnesia of the Sages arc not the common minerals, but the substance which in other pas>agcs is called the Agent, the Lion, the King, Sulphur, and by many other name!'. They call it orpimcnt because it gives a deeper and more brilliant colouring to gold ; magnesia because of the excellence and greatness of that which is gained from it ; antimony, with Thomas Aquinas, on account of the brilliant blackness which it assumes after solution. As a matter of fact, when the Stone has assumed its ebony colour they arc in the habit of comparing it to all black things. : . But it may be -;aid that some of these intermediate min.erals arc, as a matter of fact, composed of mcrcu•-r and sulphur, and may become metals, (.J:., magnesia unites with lead and tin, and antimony not only mingles with mr.tals, but also produces a · Digitized by Goog te"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"24 11/E IIERJIETIC JIUSEUJI. lead not very different from natural lead. Moreover, it is asserted that many persons of· high and low degree have actually seen gold made of these minerals. It is further said · that as these minerals arc composed of mercury and sulphur (and can by chemical means be reduced to them), and arc there· fore of a common origin with the metals, the sub!ltancc of the Stone may also be elicited from them. Uut, in the first place, we must draw a distinction between the various minerals of this class, namely those which contain mercury, and those which hardly ever contain it . Those that arc full of mercury arc of :;:rcatcr account, since, by means of our !\\lcdicinc, their mercury may be transformed into gold and siln!r ; and, their nature being partly metallic, they may well be called half metals. Uut the rest, which have no mercury, arc of no usc for our purpose. Hut forasmuch as, on account of the :;:ross and com-bustible sulphur which is in them, c\\·en the first arc very far indeed from the metallic goal; so they cannot be taken for the substance of our Stone, which should be pure and perfect mercury combined with pure, subtle, and incombustible sulphur. That they arc most impure and deeply infected with the ~rossncss of.thcir sulphur, may be ea,;ily seen by the test of a chemical experiment. One of them (zinctuml might, by reason of its weight and brilliance, be taken at first sight for pure mercury by the careless ; but when brou~ht to the test of fire it is consumed with a smoke, like tlMt of sulphur. Bismuth, on the other hand, is not even fusible by fire-such is its earthy grossness and impurity. Antimony, again, can be purged by a chemical process, and reduced to a very white and beautiful regulus. · As we gaze upon it in this purified state, it seems difficult to belic\\·e that it may not be transformed into something gloriou:>. lienee it is natural that some self-con· ccited people should ha\\·c supposed that the Stone may be prepared froro it. But however much antimony is purged of its blackness, it still retains its grossness, hardness, and sulphuric properties; it can never become malleable (like the metals), and therefore, in spite of its numerous uflinities, cannot be regarded as a metal. llorco\\·er, it has gross and impure mercury ; and .it.; sulphur is combu~tiblc.

Therefore, the substance of our Great Stone cannot be elicited from it, since (Richard, cp. 1.) nothing can be obtained from a body which does not exist therein. What shall we sar of vitriol, which misleads many br its wonderful qualities, especially as some part of it changes into copper, and itself has the power of transforming iwn into copper? As a matter of fact, it is the clemcntar)' !'ubstance I)( copper, and when this mineral \\'apour (or aeriform mcrcuryl finds in the mineral veins of the earth a place where its bitter, acid, salt, and venereal sulphur lies hid, it immediately amalgamates with it into a metal.

In iron, too, there is gross sulphur; hence it is corrodccl by \\'itriol which seeks its mercury (the mercury of iron being \\'Cry like th;,t of \\'itriol), and (the mercury being joined to the sulphur) the iron becomes pure copper.

Since, then, this corrooive sulphur is hid in vitriol, and since it contains so small ·a quantity of impure mercury, we may be sure that it cannot be the object of our search. In this we agree with Alphidius, who says : \" Take heed, my son, and eschew dead bodies, and stones ; in these things there is no true way of procedure, for their life prcscn·es not, but destroys. · Such arc salts, orpimcnts, arsenic, magnesia, bismuth,· tutty, and the like.'' And Arnold (Fios Flor.) says: \"The reason of these mistakes is that the four spirits, viz., orpimcnt, salt of ammonia, mercury, and sulphur, arc not the seed of perfect or imperfect metals (except, of course, mcrcury·and sulphur by thcmsch·cs).\" But (rom these last words of Arnold it mi~ht be inferred that common mercury and quicksilver arc the substance of the stone, seeing that these arc referred to the four spirits, and that sulphur is supposed to consolidate the mercury. But I answer, with Richard the Englishman, in his eleventh chapter, that it docs not really do so. For every .kind of common sulphur il' repugnant to metals, as the Sage says : \" Indeed you must know that sulphur comes forth out of the fatness of the earth. and is thickened in the mincra by gentle heat ; when it becomes hard it is called sulphur.\" Now there arc two kinds of sulphur, the living and the combustible. Quick sulphur is the active principle of metals, and, when purged from all foreign matter, is the Matter of our Stone. But the common combustible variety is not the Matter of metals or of our Stone ; rather, it is injurous to them. Common, combustible sulphur-so we arc told by Aviccnna and Richard the Englishman-has nothing to do with our art. Ho\\\\'C\\'Cr carefully prepared, it still disintegrates and destroys metals, because it has no affinity with them. When enclosed in metals, it retards their fusion. This is dearly seen in the case of iron, which contains hard, gross, and impure sulphur. When this sulphur is burned it is nothing but a dead, earthy, powdery substance. How then can it impart life to other things? For it has two principles of decay-its inflammability and its earthy impurity.

The Sages tciJ us that the Matter of our Stone is a mcrcur!_al V/ substance, and many of its qualities closely resemble those of \\'ulgar mercury. For it is the elementary substance of all fusible minerals, as Arnold sa)'S (Ros., pt. 1., cp. ii.) : \"Since all fusible substances, when melted, arc changed into it, and it mingles with them because of its common nature : they can differ from it only in so far as it contains impure foreign sulphur.\" And, again (cp. i\\·.): \"Living mercury is clearly moo;t perfect, and pro\\·cd in all its operations, since it sa\\·cs from combustion and promotes fusion. It is the red tincture, the sum of perfection, and quick as lightning ; nor is it ::evcred from that with which it has mingled so long as it exists. The same is full of affinity, clca\\·ing faithfully. and is the medium by which tinctures arc united, for it mingles most intimately with them, penetrating naturally into their inmost part, for it is of the ,-arne nature. We imitate ~ature exactly, who in hc.r minera hath no other matter whereon she works except a pure mercurial form. It is the only thing that O\\'Crcomes fire, and is not o\\·crcomc by it, but delights in its amicable warmth.\" Ag<lin, Bernard says : \"In this men:ury is enclosed essential sulphur, which the fire cannot touch ; and it accomplishes our objzct without any other substance than that of pure mercury.\" Seeing, then, that mercury has such excellent properties, it must surely be the substance of our Stone? True ; but as there arc t\\\\'(J kinds of sulphur, so there arc two kinds of mercury, the common mercury and the mcrcur}' of the Sages. Common mercury is gross and -· crude ; nor docs it stimd the test of fire like our mercury, but is dissipated in the form of smoke, even by gentle heat. Hence the Sages h;wc laid down this rule: \"Our mercury is not the \\ mercury of the \\·ulgar herd.\" So Lullius says lCiav. cp. 1.) : •• Common quicksilver, howe\\·er carefully prepared, can never become the quick~ih·er of the Sages, for common quick-silver can onlr stand the test of fire by the aid of some other dry and more highly digested quicksilver.\" Hut most students of this art ha\\'c spoken largely about the sublimation of common mercury, and ha\\·c pcrsist~d in seeking the treasure of earthly.

And, truly, the working even of common mercury is so wonderful that it has misled some who supposed themselves to be adepts in this art The following is a cao;c in point. I knew a man who succeeded in gh·ing to his amalgam an orange colour, but he could not get it any nearer to the colour of gold. At last this clever chemist determined to increase the heat of the furnace, thinking that this would have the desired effect of more intimately combining the various ingredients. nut alas ! the alembic burst, the gold was hurled into the fire, and almost changed from its nr.turc by the still \\'olatilc mercury. Hence it appears. that the mercury (which is its body) so strongly affected the gold in its minutest particles as to reduce it to a tincture, although sc\\·eral colours were obtained by the action of the heat on the melted mass If that good man had taken to heart Arnold's words in the \" Flower of Flowers,\" he would never have made that experiment. For the said Arnold makes reference to those who adopt this method in the following terms : \"They knew that mercury is the elementary principle of the metals. and that they arc produced through its digestion by the heat of sulphur; they therefore· sublimed mercury by itself, then fixed and cot}solidated it, again melted it and did again coagulate it : but when they came to examine the alembic, they found no gold, etc.\" Therefore we cannot believe that common quicksih'er is the substance of the Stone. At the ~amc time I do not deny that it is indispensable both to the philosophical cll)'mist and to the physician. We ha,·c carefully sought the substance of our stone in the animal and \\'egetable world, among stones, lesser, intermediate, and greater minerals, but in \\'ain. \\Vc must now sec whether we can find it in the metals, and if so, whether in all or onh· in some.

For no perfection can be obtained from imperfect metals, either by themseh·es or mixed, nor can that which is itself impcrfL-ct bring other things to perfection. For the purest sub!'tancc of mercury is required for our purpose, a.'l is testified in the \"Sounding of the Trumpet,\" and by Avicenna, Lullius, and almost all the Sages, who unanimously affirm that \" the purest substance of mercury is selected by us for our work.\" Now this highly refined substance of mercury is not found in the base metals, since they arc rendered so gross by their impure and unessential sulphur, that, like leprous bodies, . they can nc\\·cr be thoroughly purged and cleansed, in which process is the css.cncc of our artifice. Nor do they well stand the test of fire, which is one of the properties required in our 1\\lattcr. Let us hear what Gcber has to tell us (Summa, cp.lxiii.) concern-ing the impurity of imperfect metals, and the properties of perfect mercury : \"Thus,\" he says, •1 we hapJ)en upon two most wonderful secrets. The one is that there exists a twofold cause for the destruction of c\\·cry [impcrfc.:t] metal by fire : namely, ( 1 ), the combustible sulphur enclosed in their interior substance is kindled by fierce heat, and (unimpeded by any excellence in their mercury) annihilates, and converts into smoke their entire substance; (2), the outward flame is fed by them, pcn<:tratcs int.o their interior, and dissolves them into smoke, even though they be \\'cry .;olid; (J), their interior is laitl bare by calcination. Now when all these conditions of destruction arc found together, bodies must needs be destroyed; if they arc not found together, they arc destroyed somewhat more slowly. The second secret is the excellence which quicksih'cr imparts to bodies. For quick-silver (no other condition of decay being present) docs not permit itself to be separated into its clements, but pro\\·cs its perfection by prcscn·ing its substance intact in the fire. Hlesscd be God who created it. and gave it such a substance and such properties as arc not found in all Nature besides. This is that which m·crcomcs fire, and delights in its amicable heat.\" I Jere Gcber clearly shews that the substance of our Stone cannot exist in imperfect metals ; because thirigs that ·arc impure in them-selves do not abide the fire which might purify them, while our mercury (on account of its purity) is not in the slightest degree Digitized by Coogle"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"TilE GOLDEN TRACT. 31 injured by the fire. Thus we perceive that no one imperfect metal can contain the substance of our Stone. But neither is it to be found in a mixture of impure metals-for by mixing they become less pure than they were before. l\\loreo\\·er we said above that the substance we required was ont. This fact is clearly set forth by Halys (lib. secret., cp. vi.), when he says: \" The Stone is One ; nothing else must be added ·to it : out of Ollt substance the Sages obtain our remedy. Nothing else must mingle with the Stone itself, or with its substance.'' And Morienus says : \"This l\\la~istcry grows from one original root, which branches out into sc\\·eral p;u ts, and from which springs tlllt thing.\" But if base metals cannot be the substance of the Stone, wh)· do the Sages bid us employ them? I will tell )'OU. \\\\'hen they speak of impure bodies, they do not mean copper, iron, lead, tin, &c., but its own bot/J•, or its earth-as Arnold (Fios Flor.) says: \"Mercury is unitr.d to earth, i.e., to an imperfect substance [or body].\" For though this •· earth\" is so perfect and pure that in these respects it would seem to attain the utmost possibility of ~aturc, yet in regard to the Stone it is still imperfect and · impure. In this point art leaves Xature behind, since it accom-plishes what ~ature could not perform. That this earth before its plenary purgation and regeneration is imperfect, may be seen from the fact that it c.\\lll!Ot yet accomplish more in the matter of tinging than Nature has gi\\·en to it, while after its regeneration it is most powerful. Its grossness is clearly perceived in an actual experiment: for first it is black and looks like lead or antimony ; then it is of a whitish colour, and is called Jupiter (or tin, or magnesia), and this also before it has attained true whiteness, but when it has passed the white !itage, it is called :\\Iars and Venus ; after that it becomes perfect and red. That Basil. Valcntinus agrees with me, and did not really hold the opinion which he exprcssctl in some <'f his writings, is clear from his 'tract concerning the Great Stone, where (speaking of the :\\latter of the Stone) he says that in the Sun all three perfections arc found to~ethcr, whence it dcri\\·cs . its power of resisting the fire, and that the :\\loon, on accnunt of its fixed mercury, docs not easily yield to the fire, but endures the trial. \" That noble paramour Venus,\" he continues, \"is Digitized by Coogle"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"3:!' .

Therefore let us turn our backs upon the base. metals, and turn our minds to the precious metals, taking to heart those words of Plato (qu. ii.): ·• Why do you melt and dissoh•c other bodies with great labour, when in these [the precious metals] you have what you seck?

So Bernard says :pt. ii.) : \" Let them be silent who affirm that there is any tincture but our own, or any other sulphur than that which lies hid in magnesia ; also those who would extract the quicksih·cr from any but the red sla\\·c, and who speak of some other water but our own which is incorruptible and combines with nothing except that which belongs to its own nature, and moistens [tinges] nothing except th'lt which is one with its own nature.

To assist the student in solving this enigma: I must tell him that the gold of the Sages is not common gold, as also Senior tells us. In \"The Crowd\" it is said : \"As mercury is the clement of all metals, so gold is their ultimate goal; hence in all metals, pure and im-pure, ther.:: are gold, silver, and mercury. But there is one true gold which is the essence of all.\" Thus you sec that there is a gold of the Sa~es, which, though derived from common gold, is yet very ditferent from it.

Then they lh·e, and possess in a high dc~rce the power of pro-pagating and multiplying their race. Conceming the life of our metals that great philosopher, Sendh•O<Jius (who i~ still living), has the following words : \" Let me ad\\·isc you not to receh·e the gold and sih·er of the \\'UIRar herd, for they arc dead.

That is to say : ·Sow gold, i.r., the soul and quickening \\'irtue, into the white earth, which by preparation has been made white and pure and freed from all it\" grossness.

But why do the philosophers call their go!d now \"water,\" and now \"earth''? Do they not contradict themselves, or each other? No ; our Sages, in expounding the truth, \\'eil it under obscure and allegorical expressions, but nevertheless agree with each other so man·ellousl)' that they all seem to speak, as it were, with one mouth .. They do n.-:.t confound one thing with another, nor· do they wish to lead the earnest enquir::r astray. They express .themselves in .mystic phrases to hide the truth from the unworthy and impious, lest they should seem to be casting pearls before s·~:ine, and giving the holy thing to be. trodden underfoot by these who think only of indulging their lustful desires. But the. noble student of our art ha:; been told more than once, not only from what quarter our Stone may be obtained, but also that its substance must be Cl/1', which by thf: artist's skill may be resolved into two, viz., earth and fire, or _-mercury and sulphur. The Sages, then, do well to call their gold earth or water ; for th,.y ha\\'e a perfect right to term it whate\\-cr they like. So they ha\\'e frequently called their Stone their gold, their super-perfect gold, their regenerate gold, and by many other names besides. If any one docs not perceive their meaning at the first glance, he must blame his own ignorance, not their jealousy.

A solution --takes place when we tran~form a dry thing into a liquid;-a bird t_~ing into a soft, a hKlden thing into one that is manifest; u.; when a_solid is changed into water; not, however, the vulgar water (as Parmenides and Agadmon in\" The Crowd\" teach us: \"When some persons hear of the liquef.'lction; they think a change takes place into the water of the clouds. But if they had read and understood our books, they \\vould know that our water is permanent), but into the ~\\·at-=r of the Sages, i e., the elementary substance, as Arnold (Ros. 1., cp. ix.). says: \"The object of the Sages is to dissolve the Stone into its mercury, or clementarr_ matter\" And A\\·icenna says: \"Thou who wouldest attain our) object must first endeavour to d~solve· and sublime the two luminaries, which is the first stage of the experiment, that they may become quicksilver.'' Therefore Arnold (Ros. II., cp. ii.) describes the solution as a resolvin~ of bodies, and a prepar<~tion of the first Matter or Xature. And Richard the Englishman ( cp. xviii.) writes thus : \" First the Stone must be resolved into its elementary substance [seeing that it is an union of body and spirit), that the two may become one mercurial water.\" But e\\·en as this first solution is the most vital part of our process, so is it alc;o the most difficult, as Eobold Vogelius testifies when he says : \" How hard this achie\\·ement is can be affirmed br those who have performed it.\" Bernard of Trevisan, in his book addressed to Thomas of Uononia, says: \" He who knows the ~ secret of the sC'Iution is acquainted with the arcanum of the Art, which is, to mingle kinds, and effectually to extract clements from elements which lie hid in them.\" The solution must not be made with aqua fortis ; for aqua fortis corrodes and destroys the body wt.ich should be only liquefied and improved. The solution docs not take place into anr water that wets the hands, ., '-\"\" but into a dry water, which is called both sulphur and mercury, j as Zneumo sars (Turba): \"Unless by resol\\·in~ it into its ......_ clements you extract from the body its marrow, and make it an impalpable spirit, you labour in \\'ain.'' And Richard the ling Iish-man, following Avicenna, affirms lcp. xi.): \"The Sages ha\\·e striven to disco\\·er how tho!ie sulphurs may be extracted from those more perfect bodies, and how their qualities may be so refined by Art, that that which was not manifest bef..>re (although Digitized by Coogle"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"38 THE HERMETIC MUSEUM. it always lay hid in them) may appear by the mediation uf the said Art with Nature.\" And this they confess cannot be done unless th..£..body be resolved into its First Matter, which is quicksiJv_!:r, out of which it was made in the beginning, without admixture of any outward things ; since foreign matter cannot improve the nature of our Stone. \" For no water,\" says Bernard, \"dissolves our bodies, but that which is of their kind, and may be inspissated by them.\" (Ep. to Thorn. of Bonon.) And in the same I<:pistlc ho.: writes : \" The solution should be permanent, so that from both clc•nents, viz., the male and female seed, a new I SlK..'cies may result.

And every spirit is modified and coloured by bodies, to which spirit is thus added a tinging colour which stani.ls the test of fire.\" Hence the student of our art must diligently enquire what that water is. \" For the knowledl{e of the menstruum,\" says Raymond (Comp. An., p. i.) \"is a thing without which nothing can be done in the magistery of this Art. l'\\othing preserves the metals while it dissolves them, but our menstruum,\" which, as he further states in his 'Codicil,' is \"the water by which the metals are solved, while all their essential properties arc conserved.\" Though this is the Great ~-\\r::anum which our Sages ha\\'C always kept . secret, and have forbidden us to re\\·eal, yet, as far as we may, we will put you on the right track by two quotations. The first is found in the abrii.lgcd Rosary, and runs as follows: \"The first preparation and founi.lation of this Art, is the solution [i.e., reduction] of the body· into water, i.e., intn quick~ilvcr, and this they call the solution, when the)' say : Let the gold be dissolved, which is hid in the body of magnesia, that it may be reduced to its First :\\latter, that thence it may become sulphur and quick-silver, and not be again liquefied into water. The object of our solution is to make it liquid, and resolve it into the substance of quicksilver that the saltness of its sulphur may be diminished, which divine sulphur is prepared by extraction from two sulphurs, when the spirit meets the body.\" The second quota-Digitized by Coogle l I I"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"THE GOLDEN TRACT. 39 .. tion is from the \" Proremium of the Twelve GatC!l,\" by Ripley : \" I will straightway teach thee that thou maycst know that there a.!!O t!tree mercuries, which arc the kc)'s of knowledge [whicli Raymond calls his menstrua], without which nothing is properly done.

The quality of splendour comes irom the Sun and ~loon. And, in brief, these arc our solvents.

There I met a crowd of decrepit men with grey beards, one of whom, an elderly personage, had a long darkish beard, whom also I knew by name, but whose face I had never seen. These men were discusssing various subjects, ·e.g., the goodness and wisdom of God, all natural objects, and especially the great mystery which lies hid in ~aturc, which -they said-·God. conceals from the whole world, and makes known only to a few who truly lo\\'e llim. I listenc:d to them for a long time (for I was pleased with their discourse) till I thought that some were talking rather wildly, not in rc..-gard to the su~stance and. the method, but as concerns parables, similitudes, etc., which were the figments of Aristotle, l'liny, and others. When I heard these things, I could no longer contain myself, and, like Saul among the prophets, I began to give my opinion, and to refute those futile assertions by arguments drawn from experience and reason. Some of them agreed· with me, and bc..-gan to test my knowledge with ·many questions. But I was so well grounded that I stood the test to 'the admiration of all. They all mar-\\'ellccl at the soundness of my knowledge, and affirmed with one \\'oice that I should be receh·ed into their fellowship. These words filled me with great joy. But they said I could not be their Brother until I knew their Lion, and his internal and external properties. They told me I must summon up my whole strength to subdue him. I confidently replied that I would lea\\'e no stone unturned to attain this object. For their kindness affected .me so that I would not ha\\'e left them for all the wealth of this world. Therefore they conducted me to the Lion, and were at great pains to declare to me his nature. But no one would tell me how I must treat him at first. Some of them did indeed mutter a few words on this point, but so con-fusedly and obscurely, that scarce one in a thousand would ha\\'e understood their meaning. Howe\\'er, they said that when I had bound him without being harmed by his sharp claws and terrible teeth, I should know all the rest. This Lion was old, fierce, great, and terrible to behold with his flowing yellow mane.

Morl.'f)\\'er, I had some knowkodge of natural magic. I therefore relinquished my blandishments, and scir.1.-d him so gently, skilfully, and subtly, that almost before he knew what I was about I had drawn all the blood from his body, and from his very heart and bowels. This blood was r~.od indet.-d, but choleric. Then I procet.'(k-d to dissect him, and made a most marvellous discovery :-his bones were as white as snow, and their quantity more considerable than that of the blood. \\\\'hen the old men who stood round the den, and had watch1.'<l our stru~~lc, saw this, they bc<~an to converse with great eagerness, as I could sec from their gestures-fi•r, being in the ~lefl, I could not hear their words.

But as there is no JOY without a drop of bitterness, so I was still disturbed by the thought that those who had been committed to my care were still lying lifeless.

Therefore I continued diligently to perform my office of warming them, being assun .. '<l that they would not return to their bodies while they could enjoy that moist atmosphere. This conjecture was justified by the e\\·ent.

Then I retired to rest,. that I might consider the matter further (on the morrow), and fell into a d~p slumber; when, behold, Solomon appeared to me in all his power, wealth, and glory, and with him came his whole hdrem: sixty were queens, eight hundred concubines, and of ,·irgins there was a countless number. One of them was his most beautiful dove, anrl was dearest to his heart. They formed a procession according to the Catholic rite, in the centre of which was one greatly praised :md beiO\\·ed, whose name was like oint· ment poured out, and whose fragrance was sweeter than that of spices ; the fiery spirit of this person was the Key for the opf.'lling of the Temple, for cnterin~ the Holy of Holies, and taking hold on the horns of the Altar.

Then I observed that a woman stood behind me, who had bared her breast, from a deep wound in which blood and water gushed forth. Her thighs were like two half-moons, made by the 1\\lastcr; her nclvcl was like a rouod goblet ; her belly like a heap of wheat, set about with roses ; her breasts like two young roes that arc twins ; her neck like a tower pf ivory ; her eyes like the fish-pools in Hcshbon, by the Gate of Bathrabbim ; her nose like the Tower of Lebanon, which lookcth towards Damascus ; her head like Carmel, and the hair of her head like royal purple. Her garments, which were rancid, ill-savoured, and full of venom, lay at her feet, whither she had cast them ; and at length she broke forth into these words : \" I ha\\·c put off my coat ; how sh:~ll I put it on ? I have washed m)' feet ; how shall I defile them ? The watchmen that went about the city found me, they smote me, they wounded me ; they took away my veil from me.\" Thereupon I fell to the ground with great and ignorant terror. But Solomon bade me rise, and said: \" ... car nut; for you sec Nature bared, and the most secret of all secrets that is found beneath the sky and earth : She is beautiful as Tirzah, comely as Jerusalem, terrible as an army with banners-and nevertheless the pure and chaste virgin of whom A<!am was formed and created. The entrance of her tabernacle is scaled. She lives in gardens, sleeps in the double ca\\·c of Abraham, in the field of Hebron, and her palace is in the depths of the Red Sea, and in transparent caverns. The air bare her, the lire nourished her: therefore she is the Queen of the earth, and has honey and milk in her breasts ; her lips are as a dropping honey-comb ; honey and milk are under her tongue ; and the smell of her garments is to the wise like the smell of Lebanon-but to the ignorant an abomination.'' And Solomon said further : •• Aw,.kc, and sec my whole harem, and say what it i· like.\" And straightway his whole harem was stripped naked. Yet could I not find or jud~c, and my eyes were scaled lest I should know the secret.

Therefore, I will reveal to thee thi11 matter faithfully, but secretly.

All these treasures belonged to my dear daughter, and she left them all to thee before she was tran~lormed and perished.

Then I instituted a careful search · among the garments, and was soon rewc.rded with success ; but ·the cloth in which the box was wrapped was so hard and so firmly .glued to it that I could not tear it off; moreover, I could not cleanse it with lye, or cut it with iron, steel, or any other metal. So I did not know what in all the world I should do, and began to think that it was a poisoned cloth, and to call to mind the saying of the Prophet : \"Though thou wash thee with nitre and take thee much soap, yet thine iniquity is marked before me, saith the Lord God.\" So another year passed away, and still all my patient toil and thought had met with no success. At last, to drive away melan-choly, I took a walk in a certain garden ; and, after some time, I sat down upon a stone and fell into a deep sleep. I slept, but my heart_ waked.

Then I awoke again, shook off sleep, and beheld the ~lowin~ coals lying at my fc..>ct I took them up with a grateful heart, and bc<Jan to work day and night, remembering the sarin~ of the Sages : \" Fire and Azoth arc sufficient for thee\"; and the passage in Esdras (Hk. h·.): \"And he gave me a goblet filled with fire, and when I had drunk it wisdom grew in me ; and God granted me understanding, and my spirit was preserved, and my mouth opened, but nothing else was added.\" After forty nights I had finished 204 books, of which seventy were worthy to be read br the most wise, and were written upon box tablets. I thus continued in silence and hope, as that ancient woman had bidden me do, until at last, after a long time, my understanding, in fulfilment of Solomon's prophecy, became sih·cr, and my memory gold. When, in obedience to the directions of the ancient lady, I had skilfully placed the treasure of her daughter in a chamber by itself, and dosed it up, I ~azed upon those brilliant lunar diamonds, and solar rubies, and understood the meaning of Solomon when he says: \" 1\\ly Beloved is white and rudd)·, the chicfest among ten thousand.

Shortly afterwards, on the day of the new moon, an eclipse of the sun was seen, which was terrible to behold, for it began with a misty greenness, soincwhat shot O\\'cr with other colours, but it was followed by entire blackness ; all hea,·cn and earth were shrqudcd in thick darkness, and men were full of fear, but I rejoiced.

They laboriot.~sly endeavoured and fervently longed to disco,·er whether Nature contained anything that would preserve our earthly body from decay and death, and maintain it in perpetual health and vigour. For by the light of Nature, and Di\\·ine re\\·e!ation, they intuith·ely perceived that the Almighty, in His lo\\·e to men, must have.con-cealed in the world some wonderful arcanum by which every imperfect, diseased, and deft.'Ctive thing in the whole world might be renewed, and restored to its former \\\"igour. · By the most diligent and careful search they ~radually found out that there was nothing in thi$ world that could.procure for our earthly and corruptible body imtnunit)· from tf,·,rlk, since death was laid upon the l'rotoplasts, Adam and Eve, and thdr posterity, as a perpetual penalty.

When the aforesaid Gentiles had r\"-ccived this knowledge, they justly .regard\"'(! it as a most precious gift of God, and a most holy Art, and forasmuch as they pcrceh·ed that, by God's providence,· it had ~-en re\\·ealcd only to a few, and concealed from the majority of mankind, ther always made it a point of 'conscience and honour to keep it secret. · · But th.at the secret might not be lost, but rathcr·continucd and preserved to postcritr, they expounded it most f.'lithfully, both in tlwrr \\rri\\ings and in oral teaching to their fi1ithful disciples, fot· t\\le benefit of posteritr ; ne\\'erthclcss, they so clothed and con\"-cak-<1 the truth in allq~orical language that e\\·cn now bnlr \\'er}' few arc able to understand their instruction and turn ·ir to practical account.

Its most precious object they have called the PHILOSOPHER'S STONE, or the most ancient, secret. natural, incomprehensible, he:wenly, blessed, beatified, and triune universal Stone of the Sages. Their reason for naming it a stone, or likening it to a stone, was this : First because its original Matter is really a kind of stone, which, being hard and solid like a stone, may be pounded, reduced to powder, and resolved into its three clements (which :'\\ature hersclfhas joined together), and then again may be re·combined into a solid stone of the fusibility of wax by the skilled hand of the artist a~justing the law of Nature. The importance of starting with an exact knowledge of the first or otherwise the second :\\latter of the Philosophical Stone has been largely dwelt upon by all writers on this subject. This Matter is found in one thinH, out ·or which alone our Stone is prepared (although it is called by a thousand names), without any foreign admixture ; and its quality, appearance, and properties ha\\·e been set forth in the following manner. It is composed of three things, yet it is only o11t. Likewise, having been created and made of one, two, three, four, and five, it is everywhere found in one and two. They also call it the uni\\·er~al 1\\lagnesia, or the seed of the world, from which all natural objects take their origin. Its properties arc of a singular kind ; for, in addition to its man·ellous nature and form, it is neither hot and dry like fire, nor cold and wet like water, nor cold and dry like earth, but a perfect preparation of all the clements. Its body is incorruptible, and is not destroyed by any of the four clements, but its properties far exceed those of the four elements, and the four qualities, like hea\\·en and the Quintessence.

For itself is the universal and sparkling flame of the light uf :'\\aturc, which has the heavenly Spirit in itself, with which it was animated at first by God, Who pervades all things, and is called by 1\\ viccnna, the Soul of the world.

In short, it is a Spiritual Essence which is · neither celestial nor infernal, but an aerial, pure, and precious body, in the middle between the highest and lowest, the choicest and noblest thing under heaven.

For this work is no light thing, as many suppose, perhaps, because the Sar,es have called it child's play. Those to whom God has revealed His secrets may indeed find the experi· ment simple and easy. But do thou carefully beware of expos-ing thyself to great danger by unseasonable carelessness. Rather begin thy work with reverent fear and awe and with earnest prayer, and then thou wilt be in little danger.\" . Now when )'OU have exercised yourself with exceeding diligence in the oratory, the matter being ready to your hand, go into the laboratory, take the substance indicated, and set to work in the following manner. Above all things you must let it be your first .object to solve this substance (or first Entity, which the Sages have also called the highest natural. !{ood 1. Then it must be purged of its watery and earthy nature (for at first it appears an earthy. heavy, thick, slimy, and misty body), and all that is thick, nebulous, opaque, and dark in it-must be remo\\·ed, that thus, by a final sublima-tion, the heart and inner soul contained in it may be separated and reduced to a precious essence. All this can be accomplished with our Pontic and Catholic water, which in its refluent course irrigates and. fertilizes the whole earth; and is sweet, beautiful, clear, limpid, and brighter than gold, sih·er, carbuncles, or diamonds. This blessed water is enclosed and contained in our Matter. Then the extracted lleart, Soul, and Spirit must once more be distilled and c,ondensed into one by their own proper salt (which in the interior of the substance is first of a blood-red colour, but then becomes of\" a bright, clear, and transparent white, and is called by the Sages the Salt of Wisdom). You have thus first, by what is called the anterior process, separated the pure from the impure, and first rendered the visible invisible, --then, again, the invisible visible or palpable (but yet no longer so gross and shapeless as it was at first), and it is now a bright body with a pleasant, penetrating smell, and withal so subtle and . _ ethereal that if it were not fixed it would evaporate and vanish \\ ... away.

If, therefore, you wish to enjoy its glorious virtue, and manifold power, you must subject it to some further chemical processes For this purpose you must diligently observe the working of Nature (extending over a considerable period of time), and strictly follow her {.,ruidance. When you have this knowledge, you should take two parts of the afores.-.id prepared aqueous matter, and again three different parts. The first two parts you should keep ; but to the three parts add another matter, viz., the most precious and divinely endowed Body of Gold, which is most intimately akin to the First Matter. Of this add one· twelfth for the first fermentation ; for both, the spiritual and heavenly prepared substance, and this earthly Body of Gold, · -' must be joined together, and coagulated into o1u body. But it should be noted that common gold is useless for this purpose, being unsuitable and dead. For though it has been declared by God the Omnipotent to be the most precious and beautiful of metals, yet so long as it lay hid in the mine its perfect growth and dc\\·elopmcnt was hindered. Daily use, morco\\·cr, blunts its indwelling powers, namely,· sulphur, or its. soul, and it is continually lx.-cmning mingled and defiled with other things that arc forci~n to its nature. )fence it becomes daily more and more unfit to be the subject of art You must, therefore, seck to obtain gold which has a pure, .lh·ing spirit, and of which the sulphur is not yet weakened and sophistic;atcd, but is pure and clear (by passing through antimony, or by the hea\\·cn and sphere of Saturn, and being purgt.-d .of al.l its defile-ment) : otherwise the first substance, being spiritual and ethereal, will not combine with it. For this :\\lagistcry deals only with pure bodies, and suffers no unclean thing ncar, on, or around it l\\ow when these unequal parts of the water ·and gold (differing not only in quality, but also in quantity, fi,r the first is, after its preparation, ct.hcreal, thin, subtle, and soft, while the other is \\'cry hea\\')', firm and hard) ha\\'c been combined in a solutory alembic, and reduced to a dry liquid or amalgam, they should be left six or SC\\'cn days exposed to gentle heat of at least a tepid character. Then take one part of the three parts of water, and pour it into a round, oval glass phial, similar to an F Digitized by Coogle"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"82 THE HERMETIC MUSEUM. egg in shape ; put the tempered liquid in the midst thereof, and leave it once more for six or seven days ; the Body of the Sun will then be gradually dissolved by the water. Thereupon both will ~ ~o. combine, and one will mingle with the other as gently and insensibly as ice with warm water. This union the Sages have shadowed out in various ways, and likened it, for instance, to the wedlock of a bride and bridegroom (as in the Song of Solomon). \\rhen this is done, add the third part (which you ha\\·e kept) to the rest, but not all at once, or in one day, but in sc\\·en different instalments : otherwise the Body would become too liquid, and entirely corrupted by too much moisture. For as seed, when cast into the ground, is destroyed and rendered useless by an excess of moisture and rain, so our \\vork cannot prosper unless the water is judiciously administered. All this being done, let the phial be carefully closed and scaled, to prevent the compound from evaporating or losing its odour; and place it in the furnace, there exposing it to a gentle, continuous, airy, \\·aporous, and well-tempered heat, resembling the degree of warmth with which the hen hatches her eggs. [~OTE.-The Sages ha\\·e said much about vaporous fire, which they ha,·e called the fire of wisdom, which is not elemen-tary or material, but (according to them) essential and preter-j. natural. They also call it the Di\\·ine fire, i.e., the water of mercury, roused into action by common fire.) Digesfand heat if well, yet take care that none of it is sublimed, or, in the parabolic language of the Snges, that the wife docs not rule the husband, and that the husband docs not abuse his authority over the wife, &c.,-if you do thi·s, the. whole will proceed normally, without any interference on your part (except that, of course, you must keep up the fire), At first the earthly Body of the Sun is totally soh·ed, and decomposed, and robbed of all strength (the Body, which was first of a muddy impurity, changing to a coal-black colour, called by the Sages the Raven's Head, within the space of forty days), and is thus despoiled of its Soul. The Soul is borne upward, and the Body, being se\\·ercd from the Soul, lies for.some time, as if dead, at the bottom of the still, like ashes.

First there appear granular bodies like fishes' eyes, then .a circle around the substance, which is first reddish, then turns-\\1-hitc,\"then ~rccn and yellow like a peacock's tail, then a dazzling white, and finally a deep red-until at last, under the rarefying influence of the fire, the Soul and Spirit arc combined with their Body, that lies at the bottom, into a fixed and indissoluble Esscnc;e, which union and conjunction cannot be witnessed without unspeakable admiration and awe. Then you will behold the rc\\·h·ificd, quickened, perfected, and _£lorific_d Body; which is of a most beautiful purple colour (like cochineal), and· its ~incture has \\'irtue to change, tinge, and cure e\\·ery imperfect body, as we shall hereafter show more in detail. When thus, by the grace and help of God, you ha\\·e happily attained the goal of )'OUr labours, and found the l'hn:nix of the Sages, you should once more return thanks to Him with your whole heart, mid use His uri-speakable gift solely filr I lis glory, and for the admnta~e of your suffering brethren. Thus I ha\\'e most faithfully explaim!d to you the whole process by which this most noble Art; and highest achievement, to wit, the Egg of the Sages, or Philosopher's Stone, may be begun and successfully completed. If, however, during the operation, any accidental mishap should occur, it must be s<.'Cn to in time, or else the chemical process will nc\\'er be brought to perfection. If you ( 1) · obscn:e that before the compound is solved and turns black, anything is sublimed, or e\\·aporatcd, or something resembling a red oil floats on the surface of the substance (which is a bad sign); or (2) if before or after it has turned white, it turns red too suddenly; or (3) if, towards the end, it docs not properly coagulate; or (4) if the substance is so strongly affected by the heat that, being · taken out, it docs not instantly mdl on rtd /{()/ iro11 like mu·, but F2 Digitized byGoogle"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"84 THE HERMETIC MUSEUAf. tinges and colours the iron, and afterwards will not remain fixed in the fire-you may regard all these indications as symptons of a false composition and temperature, or of some kind or other of carelessness. If these defects are not immediately seen to, they will speedily become incorrigible. A cunning adept should be ac-quainted with the various devices by which they may be remedied ; and I will recount them here for the sake of the beginner. If one or more of the above defects are observed, the whole compound must again be taken o(lt of the phial, and once more · sol\\'ed in the aforesaid water of mercury (also called virgin's milk, or the milk, blood, and sweat Of the First ·Matter, or the ne\\'er-failing fountain, nr the water of life, which ne\\'erthcless contains the most malignant poison); with this water it must once more be moistened and saturated, and then subjected to the action of the fire, until there is no longer any sublimation or formation of gaseous \\'apours ; or till the final coagulation has duly taken place, as described above. Of its subsequent fermentation and multiplication, and of its uses, more will be said in the third part. Of the time required for the whole process, it is impossible to say anything very definite ; and, indeed, the Sages have put forward the most conflicting opinions on this point-no doubt because some have been occupied with it longer than others. But if any man will carefully observe the· working of Nature, and be guided by her teaching, and in all things hold a middle course, he will gain hi.,; object sooner than one that trusts too blindly to his own wisdom. Hut I tell thee not to go beyond the middle point of the letter X either in the former or latter stage of the operation, but to take one half (V) for the time of the solution and the other half for the composition. Then, again, for the final union, the number XX should be thy guide (unless anything unforeseen should occur). He satisfied with that space of time. On the other hand, do not try to hurry on the consummation, for one hour's mistake may throw thee back a whole month. If thou strivest unduly to shorten the time thou wilt produce an abortion.

They regarded the works of God with \\·cry different eyes, and in a very different manner than most men in our own times, who, alas, look on them like cows or calves, and pursue the study of our noble Art for the sake of wealth, and temporal admntage and pleasure.

Dut, as I am no physician, I will forbear to give an opinion on this point That the Stone has this virtue, every one that possesses it can discover for him-self. I prefer to set down a few observations· concerning those qualities and uses of the Stone which arc known to me by daily experience. In the first place, the practice of this Art enables us to understand, not merely the marvels of Nature, but the nature of God Himself, in all its unspeakable glory. It shadows forth, in a wonderful manner, how man is the image of the most lloly Trinity, the essence of the Holy Trinity, and the Oneness of Substances in that Trinity, as well as the difference of Persons ; the Incarnation of the Second Person of the Holy Trinity, His :'\\ativity, Passion, Death, and Resurrection; His Exaltation and the Eternal Happiness won by Him · for us men ; also our purification from ori~inal sin, in the absence of which purification all good actions of men would be vain and void-and, in brief, all the article~ of the Christian faith, and the reason why man must pass through much tribulation and an~uish, and filll a prey to death, before he can rise again to a new life. All this we sec in our Art as it were in a mirror, as we shall take occasion to set forth in our Fourth Part. Secondly, its earthly and natural usc consists in changing all imperfect metals, by means of its tincture, into pure and solid gold, a~ I will try to show as briefly as I can. The Stone or Elixir cannot be used for this purpose in the form in which we left it. at the completion of the previous stage of our process ; but it should be still further fermented and augmented in the following manner, as otherwise it could not be conveniently applied to imperfect metals and bodies. Take one part of the Essence, and add to it three parts of purest gold, which has been purged and melted by means of antimony, and reduced to very.thin plates. Let them be placed together in the crucible. Thereupon the whole compound will be transformed into a pure and efficacious Tincture, which, when applied to base. metals, in the ratio of 1 :: 1000, will change them into pure gold.

For the transformation consists in all . that is impure and unsuitable being purged off,. and rejected like dross. In the same manner flawed stones can be transmuted into_., precious diamonds, and common crystal can be so tinged as to become equal to the most prt.>cious stones. Moreover, many other things may be done with the Tincture which must not be rc\\·eak'<i to the wich'<l world. These virtues of the Stone, and others of a like kind, arc look(..'<l upon as the least import<mt by the Sages, and by all Christians on whom God has bestowed this most precious gift. Such men think them \\'ile ind(..-cd when compared with the knowledge of God and of His works which is afforded by the Stone. For let me tell you that he on whom the ~lost High has confcrr1..'<l the knowledge of this l\\lystcry est1..'Cms mere money and earthly riches as lightly as the dirt of the str1..'Cts. II is heart and all his desires arc bent upon SI..'Cing and enjoying the heavenly reality of which all these things arc but a fih'Urc; as Solomon, the wisest of wise Kings, tcstilk-s in chapter vii. of the Book of Wisdom, where he says: \" I preferred wisdom before sccptrcs and thrones, and csti..'Cmcd riches nothing in comparison of her. :\\either compared I unto her any precious stone, because all gold in respect of her is as a little sand, and sil\\'cr shall be counted as clay before her.\" Those, therefore. that desire this Art as a means of procuring temporal honour, pleasure, and wealth, arc the most foolish of men ; and they can never obtain that which they seck at so great an expense of money, time, and trouble, and which fills their hearts. their minds, and all their thoughts. For this reason the Sages ha\\'c expressed a profound contempt for worldly wealth (not as though it were in itself a bad thing, seeing that it is highly com-mended in lloly Scripture as an excellent gift of God, but because of its vile abuse). They despised it because it seemed to hinder men from following the good and the true, and to· intro-duce a mischievous cc;mfusion into their conceptions of right and wrong. These abuses of money the illustrious Marcellus Patio-genius Stellatus has graphically dcscribc..'<l in the poem cnti•Jt.'<l o;g;t;z~d ~Y Goog k"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"90 THE HERMETIC MUSEUM. the \" Zodiac of Life,'' under the sign of Sagittarius, where he draws a vivid picture of the evils of avarice. To this poem I would therefore refer the gentle reader. From this poem we may gather how lightly this dis-tinguished man, though evidently a possessor of the Stone, as appears out of his \"Zodiac of Nature,\" held gold and silver, and all things temporal, in respect of virtue. . Nor is his case by any means exceptional. All Sages have regarded wisdom, and the knowledge of heavenly things, as far better than the transient things of earth, and have so ordered their lives and actions that at the last they might obtain im-mortality and eternal glory. This feeling is well expressed by Solomon, in his Book of Proverbs (cp. xvi.), where he says: \" How much better is it to get wisdom than gold ! and to get understanding rather to be chosen than silver !\"-and again in the xxii. chapter : \" A good name is rather to be chosen than great riches, and knowledge rather than silver and gold.\" The same aspiration prompted the following words of the son of Sirach : \" See that thou keep a good name, for it is better than a thousand treasures of gold.\" 'By reason of these and other virtues which result from the philosophy of the Stone, the Sages have never wearied of extollin~ its marvellous excellence ; and they have taken great pains to make it known to the worth>·· in order that its wisdom might be accepted and practically exhibited by them. . llut to the foolish everything is obscure and difficult to be understood. This is the gist of the first six chapters of Solomon's llook of l'ro\\'crbs, where he says that men should strain every nerve to attain to our wisdom. In the Hook of Ecclesiastes, too, he uses the following words: \" My son, be satisfied with a lowly station : for it is better than all that this world desires. The greater thou art, the more humble thyself, and God will give thee grace.

And since it is God's wont to reveal His mind in parables and jig11rts, we can but regard it as or a piece with all the other dealings or God, that the Chief Good, His Son, our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, who by Hi:~ olx:dience saved all mankind (rom eternal death and restored to us the. Kingdom of I leaven, should have expressed His nature in a concrete bodily form. .This is the greatest mystery of Almighty God, and the highest and worthiest object of knowledge. [Ephes. iii. Col. i. Isaiah xlv. : \"Let the heavmJ drop down from above, mullet the skies poitr dow11 righteotts11ess. Let · the tnrth opm mtd brmg forth the Saviour.\"] And although this great Good had been prefigured to us in the Old Testament by types such as the sacrifice of Isaac, the ladder of Jacob, the betrayal and wonderful exaltation of Joseph the brazen serpent, Samson, David, and Jonah : yet, bes1dcs all these, Almighty God deigned to give us a fuller revelation and a corporal, visible, and apprehensible Idea of His heavenly trea-sures and gifts in the Person of His Son. This earthly and bodily manifestation He plainly foretold in the l)rophet Isaiah (cp. xxviii.): \"Behold, I lay in Zion for a foundation a corner stone, a tried stone, a sure foundation : he that believeth shall not make haste.\" To the same effect the Royal Seer David speaks, through the Holy Spirit, in Psalm cxviii.: \"The Stone which the builders reJected is become the head stone of the corner. This is the Lord's doing, and it is marvellous in our eyes.\" This type, the aforesaid Corner Stone, Christ applies to Himself (:\\latth .• cp. xxi.) when He says: \" Have ye never read in the Scriptures ? The Stone that the builders rejected is become the chief stone of the corner. This is the Lord's doing, and it is marvellous in our eyes.

We shall thus understand that the earthly philosophical Stone is the true image of the real, spiritual, and hea\\·enly Stone Jesus Christ. Thus, then, those who would truly know and prepare the first .

If we would find that high and heavenly Stone, we must remember that, as our earthly Philosophical Stone is to be sought in one thing and two things, which arc met with every-where, so \\\\'C must look for Him nowhere but in the eternal Word of God, and the Holy Scripture (consisting of the Old and New Tcstamcnts)-as God the Father testified at His Trans-figuration on Mount Tabor (Mark ix., Luke ix.), when He said: \"This is My Beloved Son: hear yc Him.\" In the same way Christ, the essential and eternal Word of God, speaks of Him-self: \"No one comes to the Father, but by Me \"-according to the Scripture, the infallible testimony of the Divine Word (Isaiah xxxiv.). In Isaiah viii. we find the words: \"to the Law and the Testimony.\" And Christ, the aforesaid Corner Stone,. bears witness to the necessity of Scripture, when He says : \"Search the Scriptures, for in them ye belic\\·c that yc ha\\·c eternal life, and it is they that testify cif Me.\" Thcrefi>re, David says in Psalm cxix., long before the coming of Christ : \" My delight, 0 Lord, is in Thy commandments, for they arc my counsellors ; Thy word is a lamp unto my feet : I rejoice in the way of Thy testimonies more than in great .riches. Also, I consider Thy ways, and walk in Thy testimonies.\" [Cp. Gen. xiii. Psal. xlv. Isaiah ix., 49· Jerem. xxxii. John x., J4. Rom. ix. I. Cor. v.) Moreover, when and where the Fir~t Matter of this heavenly Stone was founded (\" from the beginning of the world \"), is expressly set forth in se\\·cral passages of Holy Scripture, especially in the fifth chapter of Micah : \"Whose goings forth ha\\·e been from of old, from e\\'erlasting.\" When the Jews asked the Corner Stone II imsclf who lie was, lie answered : \" I that speak to you was from the beginning,\" arid again : \" Before Abraham was, I am.\" From these passages it follows that He had His being, without a beginning, from all eternity, and that He will abide throughout all eternity. .

In the same manner, the heavenly light slumbers in the human soul, and must be struck out by outward contact, namely, by the true faith, through reading and hearing, and through the Holy Spirit whom Christ restored to us, and promised to give us (John xiv.: \"No man comes to the Father but . by me \"), and to put into our dark, but still glowing hcartll, a!l into a kind of tinder, where lie may be fanned and kindk'<l Into a bril{ht flame, working the will of God in our souls.

With the inward he is to jud:.te spiritual things, and the outward is also to perform its o.wn proper office. The same distinction we find in the spirit and the letter of Scrip-ture.

But in order that we might be· restored to our former glorious state, God in His great mercy de\\·iscd the following remedy : As the perfect earthly Stone, or Tincture, after its completion extends its quickening efficacy, and the perfecting virtue of its t;ncturc to other imperfect metals, so Christ, that blessed heavenly .Stone, extends the quickening influence of His purple Tincture to us, purifying us, and conforming us to the likeness of His perfect and heavenly Body.

The blind and insensate world has, ind<'ed, through the craft and deceit of the Devil, tried many other ways and methods of obtaining everlasting salvation, and has toiled hard to reach the goal ; but Christ nevertheless is and remains the only true Saviour and Mediator, who alone can make us appear just in the sight of G()(l, and purify us from our spiritual leprosy-just as, upon earth, there· is only one royal, saving, chemical Stone by which all imperfect metals must be brou~ht to perfection and all bodily diseases healed (especially that fearful, and otherwise in-curable lcprosr).

For the knowledge which God has committed to me, I ha\\·e obtained, not at any learned academy, but in the uni\\'ersal school of Nature, and by perusing the open book of God. For this reason I have expressed my thoughts simply, and not tricked them out in scsquipL'<ialian words, as is the manner of pro-fessional theologians; nor do I pretend to have exhausted the subject ; all that I hare done is to throw out some hints for the guidance of those who wish to investigate it more carefully.

Besides all this, I desired to pro-fess publicly my belief in the true Christian Iilith ; since at the present time many devout and godly Christians arc fitlscly represented and decried by lying slanderers as heretics. Let not the blasphemies and reckless judgment of the wicked world trouble the true Christian, against whom they arc directed ; for the Devil and his scn·ants ha,·c at all times done to the followers of Christ what they did to Christ Himscl( Therefore I will say no more on this subject, but I will leave it to be decided by the J udgc of all the world.

The tragic end of many of these men, and the headlong destruction brought upon them by their Tincture, prove but too clcarlr the truth. of what I say. 1\\lorcovcr, all that call thcmsch-es alchemists· arc not therefore necessarily true possessors of th:: Stone.

All this is aecomplished by my hands alone. I am the architect, and no one else knows the secret of life. For, however wise he may think himself, he does not know how much to take of each element, or \\Vhere to obtain it, or how to mingle hostile elements so as to allay their discord, or how to bring the heavenly influences to bear on these essences. He cannot even make iron, or lead, or the very basest of metal ; how then should he be able to make gold except by stealing my treasure? The object which he desires can be accomplished by my art alone-an art which it is impossible· for man to know. And even though we allow gold to be the most precious of metals, yet gold by itself cannot cure diseases, or heal the imperfections of other metals, or change them into gold. In the same way glass (which might otherwise be the Philosopher's Stone) can never become so soft as to be rendered malleable. Gold alone is the most precious and the most perft..-ct of all the metals. But if you cannot even make lead, or the minutest grain of any metals, or produce the fruit of any herb, how hope-less must your search after the art of making gold appear ! Again if you say that you wish to produce some chemical result, e\\·en if it do not turn out to be gold, I answer that you therebr only gh·e a fresh proof of your folly. Can you not understand that the secret of my innermost working must always remain a scaled book to you? What !IJature docs can ne\\·er be success-fully imitated by any created being. Nay, if I made gold out of sc\\·en metals, and you do not understand my method, how can you e\\·er hope to prepare the substance which itself changes all metals into the purest gold, and is the most precious treasure that God has gh·cn me? You are foolish and ignorant, if you do not know that this precious thing which )'OU seck is, to the crcatt..>d mind, the greatest mystcrr of Nature, and that it is com-pounded by heavenly influences-and thus has power to heal and delh·er men from all diseases, and to remove the imperfec-tion of the base metals. If, therefore, it is in itself so perfect that it has not its like. upon. earth, it must surely be the work-manship of the highest Intelligence, since no one else can even make gold, and certainly not produce a thing which has itself the power of making gold.

In conclusion, let me tell you that your artificial fire will never impart my heavenly ~varmth, nor will your water, oil, and earth supply you with any substitute for my substance. It is the gift of God, shed upon the clements from heaven, and upon one more than upon another; but how, is known only to me, and to the Great Artist who entrusted me with this knowledge. One thing more let me tell you, my son. If you would imitate me, you must prepare all out of one simple, self-contained 1\\lattcr, in o11e well-closed \\'esscl, and in t•lle alembic. The substance contains all that is nct.-ded for its perfect development, and must be prepared with a warmth that is always kept at the same gentle temperature. Let me ask you to consider the birth and development of man, my noblest work. You cannot make a human body out of any substance whatsoever. Of my method in forming so subtle a body neither Aristotle nor Plato had the· remotest knowledge. I harden the bones and the h.'Cth, I make the flesh soft, the muscles cold, the brain moist, the heart, into which God has poured the life, warm, and fill all the veins with red blood. And in the same way, I make of one quicksih·er, and of one acti\\·e male sulphur, one maternal vessel, the womb of which is the alembic. It is true that man aids me with his art, by ', ' sheddinl{ .external heat into the matrix ; more than this, however, he cannot do. He, then, that knows the true Matter, and prepares it properly in a well-closed vessel, and puts the whole in an alembic, and keeps up the fire at the proper de<Jrcc of \\varmth, may safely leave the rest to me.

These arc the first three classes ; in the fourth it pleased God to place only the noblest and most perfect of Hi:; works, namely, man, to whom He also gave a rational and im-mortal soul.\"· This soul is obscured by the defilement which found its way into the body through the senses, and, but for the grace and mercy of God, would have become ilwolved in its condemnation. Hence the· chief perfection of man is not derh·cd from thee, nor dost thou impart to us our humanity. ~everthcless, the material part of man is the work of thy hands alone. And, surely, our bodies arc cunningly and wonderfully made, and, in every part of them, bear witness to the masterly skill of the workman. I low man·cllous arc the uses uf our various members!

Wert thou wantin~ in wisdom, or knowledge, or· couldst thou nut do otherwise? Pardon me if I speak tuo presumptuously about thy wisdom, I only desire to be rightly and truly informed.

I shall ne\\·er be able to attain any satisfitctory result in this Art, unless thou wilt enlighten my blindness.

Thou sayest that I must follow th'-'C ; and I 'am willing to do so. Hut tell me what I must do, and what books I must study for that purpose. Of the books which I ha\\·e read, one says, \" Do this,\" and the other, \" No, do that \"; and they are full of unintelli~ible expressions and of dark parables. At last I see that I cannot learn anything from them. Therefore I take refuge with thee, and instantly beseech thee to ad\\\"ise and to tell me how to set about this difficult task. On my kncss I implore thee to show me the war br which I can penetrate into the lower parts of the earth, and by what subtle process I am to obtain the perfect mercury of the metals. And yet I doubt whether any man, even after obtaining this mercurr, can really make gold That is thy work, and not the work of man ; as thy words and my own experience most clearly shew. We sec that the cold and moist mercury needs the assistance of its sulphur, which is its seed after its kind, or its homogeneous sperm, out of which the metal or Stone must be produc'--d. But thou sayest only: Take the proper substance, the proper \\·esscl, the proper mineral, the proper place, and the proper fire; then form, colour, and life will grow and spring forth from thence. Thou art the :\\rchik'Ct ; thou knowest the glorious properties of the Matter. The active principle can do nothing unless there be a passh·c principle prepar'-·d to n.>ccivc it,; influence.. Thou knowest how to mix the warm and the cold, the dry and the moist ; by reconciling hostile elements, thou canst produce new substances and forms. For I did indt.\"Cd understand all that thou didst tell me, but am unable to expres.-. it so well as thou. This thou hast firmly impressed on my mind, that the Elixir is composed by the reconciling and mutual transmutation of the four elements. But what man is sufficient for such a task? For who knows how earth can ha\\·e its essence in common with air, or how it can be changed into moisture which is contrary to its nature? For humidity will not leave a cold and humid clement, not c\\·en under the influence of fire. This, too, is the work of Nature, that it bccom'-'S black, and white, and red. These three \\\"isiblc colours correspond to the three clements, earth, water, and fire, and arc pen·aded by the air. Then, again, thou sayest that the Stone is prepared of ,,e thing, of o11e substance, in o11e vessel, the four (elements) Digitized by Coogle"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"IJ6 THE 1/ERli/ET/C 11/USEUJI/. compoliing one essence in which is 0111 agent which begins and completes the work ;· man, thou saycst, need do nothing but add a little heat, and leave the rc.:st to thy wisdom.

Only one substance is rc.:quired, \\vhich contains within itself air, water, ;ind fire-in short, everything that is needed fi1r the completion of this work. ~o (urthur handling of any kind is necessary, and a ~-tentle fire is sufficient to ruuse the internal warmth, just as an infant in the womb is cherished by natural heat.

If I did this, continued that impostor, I should be able to prepare the Elixir.

This, he said, was the right way of making the Stone. But I know that all this is sheer non-sense, and that such men arc only deceiving themselves and others. I am also aware that only God can produce anything out of the clements. He alone knows how to mingle and combine them in their due proportions. For He alone is the Creator and Author of all good things, and there is nothing in the world that He has not made. Therefore, let the charlatans cease their vain-glorious talk, and remember that they can never hope to gather where they cannot sow; let them make an end of their f.'llse cal-cinations, sublimations, distillations, by which they extract the spirit in a \\'a porous form, and of their juggling coagulations and congclations, by which they pretend, even among the initiated, to be able rightly to separate the clements of gold and quicksilver. It is certainly true that all things under hca\\·cn arc composed of the four clements, and mixed of them according to the due pro-portion of their genus and species ; but it is not simply the union of the four clement~ but their being combined in a certain way, which constitutes the substance of the l'hilosophical Stone. I also understand that in the red quicksilver and perfect body, which is called the Sun, the four clements arc combincll in a peculiar war, and so inseparably conjoined, that no mere human art can dh·idc them. For all ancient and true Sages say that fire and air arc enclosed in earth and water, and contend so violently with each other that none but God and Xaturc can loosen their grappling embrace. This I can truly affirm and also prove. For we can neither sec the fire nor grasp the air ; and if any one says that .the sc\\·cral clements can be seen he is an imposter, seeing that they arc inseparably and inextricably conjoined. For, although the Sophists pretend, and confidently affirm, that they can divide gold and quicksilver into the four clements, yet filr all that they speak not the truth. If two clements, fire and air, were thus taken away, all the rest must vanish into nothing. They may say that those two arc retained, but they arc, never-theless, ·densely \\l.:norant as to what becomes of them ; for air and fire cannot be St.'Cn or perceived.

It is worse than useless, therefore, to meddle with the composi-tion, or to separate the clements, which Nature has so skilfully combined in the quicksih·er, and in the perfect body of the gold.

But if this fixed grain is taken away, ami se\\·ercd from ita mercury (or the mineral in which it is found), it can no longer gain in size.

If it is left on the tree, it is nourished and increased by the sap and the juice of the parent stem, and thus gradually attains to its proper size, and to maturity. Hut; until ripeness has been attained, the fruit continues to attract to itself the sap and juice of the tree, that is to say, so long as the connection with the parent tree is not severed. Almost the same thin~ happens with gold. Such a grain attracts to itself the mercury of the lead, and incessantly\" fixes\" it into its own mercury, whereby it grows and gradually increases in size. The mercury of perfect or impcrft.-ct metals is the parent tree, and the grain (of gold) can be nourished with nothing but this mercury.

Instead of growing, it will gradually shrh·cl up, and become smaller. The same thing may be obsen·ed in the case of the met;tls. For if any one were to take common metallic gold and silver, and tried to resoln! those metals into mercury, he would be doing a very foolish thing. It is a result which cannot be brought about by any chemical proccrs. however subtle and ingenious, just as fruit which has once been plucked in an unripe state can nc\\·er again be vitally joint.'<l to the parent tree.

For you sec that Nature uses only one substance in her work of developing and perfecting the metals, and that this substance in-cludes everything that is required. Now, this substance appears to call for no special treatment, except that of dige~tion by gentle heat, which must be continued until it has reached ih hight.-st possible degree of development. For this simple heating pro-cess the cunning sophists have substituted solutions, congula-tions, calcinations, putrefactions, sublinntions, anc.J other fantas-tical operations-which arc only different names for the same thing ; and thereby they have multiplied a thousand-fqld the difficulties of this undertaking, and gh•cn rise to the popular· notion that it is a most arduous, ha?.ardous, and ruinously ex pen· sive enterprise.

For out of sheer malice they have rendered the road of truth impassable, and perplexed a simple natural process with such an elaborate tissue of citcumstantial nomen-clature, as to make the ;unelioration of the metals appear a hope· lesslr difficult task.

Again, they use the expres-sion, \" our sulphur,\" whereby they mean nothing but the fire itself, which lies hid beneath the water, or humidity, and is heated by the water to its highest degree. Then, again, they call it Hylc, or the First Substance, because all things arc first generated out of water and fire. Other names, such as Arsenic, Orpimcnt, Bismuth, are not used by the Sages at all, but only by certain ignorant charlatans, of whom we ne<.-d not take any further notice. Let tts follow the guidance of Nature: she will · not lead us astra}'. If you let this be your motto, you will surely be able to call to mind the first substance, out of which all metallic sub-stances arc generated. But before we consider this question, it will much behove you to understand why the Sun, Moon, Venus, 1\\fars, Jupiter, and Saturn, arc metals, and what is their origin. Besides finding an answer to this question, you must also bear in mind that all created things arc divided into three kingdoms, ,·iz., the animal, the vegetable, and the mineral. To the first belong all living things that have flesh and blood ; to the second all herbs, plants, and trees ; to the third all metals, stones, and everything that cannot be burned. But, though divided into three classes, yet all things, 0 my brother, may be traced back to one common Principle, from which they derive their generation, or birth. By different varieties of heat this first substance is transmuted in various ways, and assumes different specific forms. Since, then, Nature is so simple, I advise you once more to have done with all those foolish sublimations, coagulations, and putrcf.'lctions, and the ridiculous old wives' fables which arc even now believed by many, and simply to follow Nature, and her. unsophisticated methods : then she will take rou by the hand, and guide you to the true substance.

This simple truth, the vulgar herd of alchemists · seem quite unable to understand, and thus go on toiling day by day with substances which have nothing to do with the matter. They might as well sow hom, or wood, cr stones, and expect a 1 golden harvest of com. The Sllll and tJifJtllt cannot be made out of all substances, but only out of the natural Essence out of which all things are formed, being aftem·ards differentiated into divers substances by· different varieti~.-s of heat. Thus the special quality of every individual thing is to be referred to the d~:grl.'C of its coction. If, therefore. we wish to cxcrQsc the true Art of Alchemy, we must imitate the method by· which ~ature docs her work in the bowels of the earth. · ·:: The ancients ha\\'e named many colours in . conncxion with this process, such as black, white, citrine, red, green, and so forth. All this is simp!)• intended to lead you astray from · the ri~ht road, and to keep you in ignorance. :rhosc ancient writers were constantly at the ~realest pains to obscure their style with such a perplexin~ variety of allc..\"gorical ,expressions as to render it impossible for the ordinary reader to uncer-stand their meaning. . . 1 Therefore, I would again and again exhort you not to believe them when they tell you that you must ha\\·e or take a black substance, or that the sub3tance turns blat.:k. white, and red in the course of the chemical process. The black colo~r was suggested to them by the fact that the substance or essence at first mingles with a brilliant material fire, by which a liquid is separated from the essence in the form of a certain black fume This black fume the ancients called the Hinck Raven, and the essence they denominated the Ra,·cn's Head.· This separation you should carefully obsen·e. From it the ancients lc:.mcd that the separation of natural subtances is nothing but a natural defect of the heating process. This, again, suggested to them the consideration that those essences that had been imperfectly heated by N aturc, might be a:dcd in a natural manner by ordinarr fire, and that thus the essences which arc still combus-tible, and their liquids (which the ancients invidiously called mcrcurr), being black when they arc separated from the essence, might be perfected by art, and the essences guarded against com-·. bust ion by their liquid, and the liquid rendered incapable of being o;g;t;z~d by Coogle"},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"156 THE HERAIETIC MUSEUM. separated from the essence. This the ancients called \" our sulphur.\" For after this preparation the essence is no longer vegetable or animal, but by the perfection of its heating it h:u become a mineral essence, and is therefore called sulphur ; the essence is nothing but an eleme11/ary fire, and its liquid, which is J..'llardcd against combustion, is true elemmlary air, and, because air is naturally warm and moist, it is called mercury by those jealous ancients. Air contains in itself the nature of fire, and elementary lire, again, contains within itself the nature of air : thus, by the union of their common clements, a true amalgama-tion of the two can take place. Such arc the material fire and water which we stc. These material clements arc nothing but an aid to the essences of the clements by which they can be naturally reduced to the highest dc~rce (of perfection?). This gradation is the only true Alchemy, and there is none beside. The pseudo-alchemy of our modern charlatans is mere waste of money and time. It would be a great mistake for you to suppose that you . ~an derive any real knowledge from the writings of the Sa~cs. They show you only the outsrJc-, and conceal the internal Essence.

This liquid, with its fire, is differentiated into the various kinds of natural bodies, by the various degrees of heat, or • coclirm,' which take place in them. One thing is more pcrfe.:tly heated in its elementary fire th,rough its liquid, than another. The VNJCiable nature is that in which the coction is least perfect.

The coction of the a11imnl is almost as imperfect as that of the vegetable sub.'>tancc: for its essence is ca'>ily burned. The coction of the mi11trn/ substances is the most perfect of all, because in them the metallic liquid is more closely united (by coction) to its elementary fire. Hence metals arc better able to resist common fire than the vegetable and animal substances. When a metal is placed in the fire, it docs not burn with a bright flame like wood ; for the liquid of wood is not so completely joined (by coction) to its essence, as the liquid of metals is to its essence. The union of the liquid with the essence is not metallic, but vc~etablc, for which reason the latter is consumed with a black smoke, when, by a higher degree of coction, the vegetable has been transmuted into a metallic essence, it no longer gives out a black smoke in common fire, but a 'white smoke, as you may sec when imperfect metals arc melted in tftc fire. That is why the Ancients said that rou must first make the substance black before you make it wftit£>, i.t'., it must first gh·c out a black smoke before it gives out a white. A~ain they say: You must first make it white before you make it red. To make red is to make perfect, because gold and sih•er have been rendered perfect by coction, their essence being fully united to their liquid, and changed into pure fire.

If you thoroughly stu~y the simple fundamental nature of the metals, you will know what their enigmatic expressions mean, and will not, like some moderns, conclude from their writings that you must take a certain substance and dissolve it until it turns black, then again purify and calcine it till the blackness disappears and it begins to turn white ; and after that, once more increase the fire and calcine and toil until the substance turns red. Such an interpretation of the language of the Ancients can only suggest itself to persons entirely ignorant of the nature of metallic substances; indeed, the Ancients wrote as they did solely in order to hide their real meaning from all but the close students of Nature.

The metallic essence can not be ~cparatcd from the imperfect metals without being injured ; for if it be separated with fire the liquid tnust evaporate, and the essence (with its earth) be consumed. Nor will you be able to separate the essence of the imperfect metals by means of aqua fortis, arsenic, aqua \\'ita:, or alkali, without · injurin:,: the essence and its liquid by the forci~n moisture : for the metallic nature can bear no forci:,:n substance, and if any foreign moisture combines with the metallic ~iquid, it loses its proper quality and is entirely corrupted. The metallic essence of the perfect metals you cannot obtain in a separate furm ; for their lillUid and elementary fire arc welded together by so perfect a procl..'SS of coction, and so closely united with their earth, that neither fire nor wat<'r can ll\\'ail to separate them, seeing that the tire has no power O\\'er them, and no foreign moisture can combine with, or corrupt, the liquid of perfect metals. :\\II your labour will be in \\'ain : the coction has done its work so well that rou will ne\\·er be able to undo it. Hence, the Ancients said that there was no sulphur· in anything but in the metals, and hence also they called the metallic liquid quicksih·er. But names do not alter facts: the fact is that the elementary fire must be so united to its element-ary liquid by natural coction that the)' .become indi\\·isiblc.

The Enigma of the wise (the Stone) is the Salt and Root of the whole Art, and, as it were, its Key, without which no one is able either to lock or unlock its secret entrance. No man can understand this Art who does not know the Salt and its prepara-tion, which takes place in a convenient spot that is both moist and warm ; there the dissolution of its liquid must be accomp-. lishcd, while its substance remains unimpaired. These arc the words of Gcbcr. E.t-plallalilllt. Know that the Salt of which Gcbcr speaks has none of the specific properties of salt, and yet is called a Salt, and zs a Salt. It is black and fetid, and when chemically prepared, assumes the I appearance of blood, and is at length rendered white, pure, and dear. It is a good and precious Salt which, b)' its own operation, is first impure and then pure. It dissolves and coap-ulatcs )( itself, or, as the Sage says, it locks and !Jnlocks itself.

Moon whiteness, and brings bodies to their spiritual condition at the same time that it removes their blackness and bad sulphur. With it bodies arc calcined : it is the secret of the red and white tincture, the foundation and root of all things, and the best of all created things after the rational soul of man.

For a~t Almighty God has created all things out of the dry and the humid clements, our Art, by divine grace, may be said to pursue a precisely similar course. If therefore any man know the prin-ciple and method of creative nature, he should have a good understanding of our Art. If anyone be unacquainted with ~ature s methods, he will find our Art difficult, although in reality it is as easy as to crush malt, and brew beer. In the beginning when, according to the testimony of Scripture, God made heaven and cartjl, there was only o11e :\\latter, neither wet nor dry, neither earth, nor air, nor fire, nor lig-ht, nor darkness, but one single substance, resembling vapour or mist, invisible and impi\\Tj)itblc. It was called Hylc, or the first Matter. If a thing is once more to be made out of nothing, that \" nothing •· must be united, and become ,,,. thing; out of this tJ/1<' thing must arise a palpable substance, out of the palpable substance fill<' body, to which a liviug soul must be given-whence throu!:h the grace of God, it obtains its specific form. \\\\'hen God made the substance, v-it was d_ry, but held tog-ether by moisture. If anything was to grow from that moisture, it had to be separated from that which was dry, so as to get the fire by it~clf, and the earth by itself. Then thc.l earth had to be sprinkled with water, if any-thing moist was to grow out of it, for without moisture nothing can grow. In the same way, nothing grows in water, except it have earth wherein to strike root. II then the water is to bedew 1 the earth, there must be something to bring the water into con-, tact with the earth ; for example, the wind prevents all ordinarr i water from fl<>wing to the sea, and remaining there. Thus one \\ clement without the aid of another can bear no fruit ; if there 1\\ was nothing to set the wind in motion it wPuld never blow-therefore the fire has received the office of impelling and obliging : it to do its work. · This you may sec when you boil water over I the fire ; for then there arises a steam which is really air, ~mft•r -being nothing but coagulated air, and air being generated from I. water by the heat of the Sun.

So long as Adam obeyed the· Dh·in~ precept· he had immortality, and possessed all. that he needed .for perfect happiness.

It was on account of this original sin that Adam, in spite of his great wisdom and the many arts that God had taught him, could not accomplish his full thousand years. But if he had not known the virtues of herbs, and the Medicine, he would certainly not have li\\·ed as long a.'l he did. When, however, at length his Medicine would no longer avail to sustain life, he sent his son Seth to Paradise to fetch the ,tree ~ of life. . This he obtained after a spiritual manner. Hut Seth did • seek also and was given some olives of the Tree of the Oil of Mercy, which he planted on the grave of his father. From them sprang up the blessed Tree of the Holy Cross, which through the atoning death of our Redeemer became to us wretched, liinful men, a most potent tree of life, in gracious fulfilment of the request of our first parent Adam. On the other hand, the suffering, disease, and imperfection brought not only upon men, but also upon plants and animals, by the fall of Adam, found a remedy in that precious gift of Almighty God, which is called the Elixir, and Tincture, and has power to purge away the imperfections not only of human, but even of metallic bodies ; which excels all other medicines, as the t>rightness of the sun shames the moon and the stars. Uy means of this most noble Medicine many men, from the death of Adam to the fourth monarchy, procured for themselves perfect health and great length of days. Hence those who had a good knowledge of the Medicine, attained to three hundred years, others to four hundred, some to fi\\·e hundred, like Adam ; others again to nine hundred, like 1\\lethusalem and :\\oah; and some of their children to a longer period still, like Hacham, llrehur, Kalix, llermes, Geber, Albanus, Ortul;mus, Morienus, Alexander of Macedonia, Anaxagoras, l'ythagoras, and many others who possessed the Medicine of the Blessed Stone in silence, and neither used it for e\\\"il purposes, nor made it known to the wicked ; just as God II imsclf has in all times hidden this know-ledge from the proud, the impure, and the froward.

As a matter of fact, all their mistakes arise from their .misinterpreting the meaning of words which should have put them on the right scent.

Through this warmth there is produced in the earth a vapour or spirit, which rises upward and carries with it the most subtle clements. It might well be called a fifth clement : for it is a quintessence, and con-tains thc;_.rnoJ<t volatile parts of all the clements. This mpour strives to float upward through the summit of the mountains, but, being co\\·ercd '\\'ith great rocks, they prevent it from doing so: for when it strikes against them, it is compelled to descend again. It is drawn up by the Sun, it is forced down again by the rocks, and as it falls the vapour is transmuted into a liquid, i.t., sulphur and mercury. Of each of these a part is left behind-but that which is volatile rises and descends again, more and more· of it remainin~ lx.:himl, and becomin1: fixed after each de.;ccm. This \" fixed \" substance is the metals, which cleave so firmly to the earth and the stones that the}' must be smelted out in a red-hot furnace. The grosser the stones and the earth of the moun-tains arc, the less pure will the metal be ; the more subtle the soil and the stones arc, the more subtle will be the vapour, and the sulphur and mercury formed by its condensation-and the purer these latter arc, the purer, of course, will the metals them-selves be. \\Vhen the earth and the stones of the mountain are gross, the sulphur and mercury must partake ofthis grossness, and cannot attain to their proper dc\\·elopmcnt Hence ari!SC the different metals, each after its own kind. For as each tree of the field has its own peculiar shape, appearance, and fruit, so each mountain bears its own particular ore ; those stones and that earth being the soil in which the metals grow. The quality of this soil is to a great extent dependent upon planetary influences. The nearer the mountains lie to the planets, the more do metals grow in them : for the qualities of metals arc determined by planetary influences. !\\fountains that arc turned towards the \\ sun have subtle stones and earth, and produce nothing but gold.

Thus you sec that gold glitters like the Sun, and silver like the 1\\loon. !\\:ow, children alwars resemble their parents ; and all metallic bodies contain within themsch-cs the properties of the Sun: to change the baser metals into gold and silver, there is positively nothing wanting but gentle solar warmth. In this respect there exists a close analogy between animal and vegetable growth. When the Sun retires in the winter, the Rowers droop and llic, the trees shed their lea\\'es, and all \\'cgctablc de\\·clopmcnt · is temporarily sus-pcmled.

Now, by the special grace of God. it is possible to bring this natural fire to bear on imperfect metals by means of our Art, and to supply the conditions of metallic growth without any of the hindrances which in a natural state prevent perfection. Thus by applying our natural lire, we can do more towards \"fixing\" im-perfect bodies and metals in a moment, than the Sun in a thousand year.;.

It is the most precious fire that God has created in the earth, and has a thousand virtues-nay, it is so precious that men h.we a\\\"t.orrcd. that the Divine Power itself works t;ffcctually in it. It has the purif)•ing virtue of l'urgatory, and e\\·crything is rendt.'l'ed better by it It is not wonderful, therefore, that a fire should be able to fix and clarify Mercury, and to cleanse it from all grossness and impurity. The SagL-s call it the living fire. because God has endowed it with His own Divinc,and \\-ital-ising power. In the writings of the Sages, this fire goes by different name~. Some call it \"burnt\" wine, others assign to it three names from the analogyof the Three l'crsons of the lloly Trinity, God the Father, God the Son, and God the lloly Ghost ; Body, Soul, and Fire, or Spirit · The Sa~e~ further say: The fire is fire, and also water, containing within itself both cold and heat, moisture, and dryness, ·nor can anything cxtin~uish it but itself.·: lienee others say that it is an inextinguishable fire, which is continually burning, purifying, and tingin~ all metals, consum·ing all their impurities, and combining Mercury with the Sun in so close an union that they become one and inseparable. Therefore our great Teachers sa)' that a~ God the FathL\"f', the Son, and the lloly Ghost, arc three Persons, and yet but one God ; so this fire unites these thrL\"C thin~s. namely, the Bod)·, Spirit, and Soul, or Sun, Mercury, and Soul. The fire nourishes the Soul which binds to<Jether the Hod}• and the Spirit, and thus all three become .one, and remain unitL-d for cn:r. A~ain, as an ordinary fire, on being supplied with fuel, may spread and fill the whole wttrlcl, so this Tincture may be multiplied, and so this fire may enter into all metals ; and one part of it has power to chan~c two, three, or fi\\\"C hundred part~ of other metals into gold. · Again, the Sa~cs ::all this fire the fire of the lloly Spirit, because as the Di\\'inity <'f Christ took upon itself true flesh and blood without forfcitin~ anything of its Uh·inc :'\\ature, so the Sun, the 1\\loon, and :\\lercury, arc tran~mutcd into the true Tincture, which remains unaffected by all outward influences, Digitized by Coogle"},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"200 THE HERMETIC MUSEUAI and endures, and will endure, for ever. Once more, as God feeds many wicked sinners with his blood, so this Tincture tinges all gross and impure metals, without being injured by contact with them. So also, therefore, may it be compared with the sacro-saintly Sacrament of the Most Holy Eucharist, from which no sinner is excluded, how impure soe\\·er he may have been. You have thus been made acquainted with the all but miraculous virtue of this fire: remember that no student of this Art can possibly do without it. For another Sage says: \"In this invisible fire yo<~ ha\\·e the whole mystery of this Art, as the three Persons ol the Holy Trinity arc truly concluded in one substance.\" In this fire the true 1\\rt is· summed up in three palpable things, which yet are invisible and incomprehensible, like the lloly Spirit.

When he has committed the seed to the ground, he needs moisture, or rain, to decompose the grain, and to raise it to new life. He also requires fire, that is, the warmth of the Sun, to bring it to maturity.\" The needs of our Art are of an analogous nature. First, you must prepare your seed; i.e., cleanse your Matter from all impurity, by a method which you will find set forth at length in the Dicta of the Sages which I subjoin to this Trcatbc. Then you must have good soil in which to sow your Mercury and Sun ; this earth must first be weeded of all foreign elements if it is to yield a good crop. lienee the Sage enjoins us to •: sow the seed in a fruitful field, which has been prepared with living fire, and it will produce much fruit \" Digitized by Coogle"},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"THE GLORY OF THE JVORLD. 201 IYIIIfl is tlu Uri11e of Clli/Jmt? I will now truly inform you concerning the Urine of Children, and of the Sages. The spirit which is extracted from the metals is the urine of children : for it is the seed and the first principle of metals. Without this seed there is no con-summation of our Art, and no Tincture, either red or white. For the sulphur and mercury of gold arc the red, the sulphur and mercury of sih·er arc the white Tincture: the Mercury uf the Sun and Moon fixes all llcrcury in imperfect metals, and imparh excellence and dumbility e\\·cn to common .Mercury. Dioscoridcs has written an cleg;mt treatise concerning this Urine of Children, which he calls the first Matter of metals. What is the J/crcurJ• of the Sages? Mercury is nothing but water and salt, which have been subjected for a long space of time to natural heat so as to be united into one. This is Mercury, or dry water, which is not moist, and do::s not moisten anything ; of course, I do not speak of crude common mercury, but of the llercury of the Sages. The Sages call it the fifth clement. It is the vital principle which brings all plants to maturity and perfo.:ction. The other quint-csso.:nce, which is in the c;1rth, and partly material, contains within itself its own seed which grows out of rts soil. The he;wenly quintessence comes to the aid of the carthl)·, remo\\·es the grossness of its earth, and bring.; the aforesaid seed to maturity. For :\\lercurr, and the Celestial Quintessence, drain off all harmful moisture from the quintesso.:nce of the earth. This :\\lcrcury is also -called sulphur of the air, sulphur being a hardening of mercur.l:.; or we may describe them as husband and wife, from whom issue many children in the earth. You must not think that I desire to hide from you my true meaning: nay, I will further endeavour to illustrate it in the following way. Common sulphur, as you know, coagulates common mercury ; for sulphur is poisonous, and mercury deadly. How then can rou obtain from either of them anything suitable for pcrfc..-cting the other, sl'cing that both requiro.: to be assisted b)· some ex-ternal agent?

Again, you may clearly perceive that the quintessence of the earth has its operation in the winter when the earth is closed up with frost ; while the Quintessence of the Stars operates in the summer time, when it removes all that is injurious in the inferior quintessence, and thus quickens everything into vigorous growth. The two quintes!l«:nces may also be driven off into water, and there conserved. An earthly manifestation you may behold in the colours of the rainbow, when the rays of the Sun shine through the rain. But, indeed, there is not a stone, an animal, or a plant, that does not contain both quintessences. In short, they embody the secret of our whole Magistery, and out of them our Stone: is prepared. Hermes, in his Emerald Table, expresses himself as follows: \"Our Blessed Stone, which is of good substance, and has a soul. ascends from earth to hea\\·en, and a~ain descends from heaven to earth. Its effectual working is in the air ; it is joined to l\\lercur)'; hence the Sun is its Father, the !\\loon its Mother; the wind has borne it in her womb, the earth is its nursing mother, and at len~th that which is above is also that which is below. The whole represents a natural mixture: for it is a -Stone and not a Stone, fixed and volatile, body and soul, hus-band and wife, King and Queen.\" Let what I have said suffice, instead of many other words and parables. Compos~litm. · Albertus expresses himself thus concerning the conjunction of the Stone: \"The clements arc so subtle that no ordinary method of mingling will avail. They must first be dissolved into water, then mixed, and placed in a warm spot, where they are united after a time by natural warmth. For the Elixir and the two solutions must be conjoined in the proportion of three parts of the Elixir and one part of the crushed body. This must a~ain be coagulated and dissoh·ed, and so also again until the whole has become one, without any transmutation. All this is accomplished by the virtue of our mercurial water ; for with it the body is dissolved. It is that which purifies, conjoins, dissoh·es, and makes red and white.\" Aristotle says of it as follows : This water is the earth in which Hermes bids us sow the seed ; the Sun or Moon, as Senior hath it, for extraction of Digitized by Coogle"},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"THE GLORY OF THE WORLD. 203 the Divine water of sulphur and mercury, which is fire, warming and fructifying by the igneous virtue thereof.

I will now proceed to quote the very words of the various Sages in regard to this point, in order that you may the more easily understand our meaning. Know then that Al-mighty God first delivered this Art to our Father, Adam, in Paradise. For as soon as He had created him, and l'et him in the Garden of Eden, He imparted it to him in the following words : \"Adam, here arc two things: that which is above is ' volatile, that which is below is fixed. These two things contain the whole myster}'· Obsen·c it well, and make not the virtue that slumbers therein known to thy children ; for these two things shall sen·c thee, together with all other created things under hea\\·en, and I will lay at thy feet all the excellence and power of this world, seeing that thou thyself ar-t a small world.\" ii. AllEL, the son of Adam, wrote thus in his Principles: After God had created our Father, Adam, and set him in l'aradise, He subjected to his rule all animals, plants, minerals, and metals. For man is the mountain of mountains, the Stone of all stones, the tree of trees, the root of roots, the earth of earths. All these things he includes within himself, and GCid has ~i\\·en to him to be the preserver of all things. . iii. SETII, the son of Adam, describes it thus: Know, · . my c11ildren, that in proportion as the acid is subjected to coc-tion, by means of our Art, and is reduced into ashes, the more of the substance is extracted, and becomes a white body. If you cook this well, and free it from all blackness, it is changed into a stone, which is called a white stone until it is crushed.

The whole process is performed by means of this sharp acid and the power of God. iv. lslNDRUS: Our great and precious Matter is @ir, for air ameliorates th~ Matter, •Nhether the air be grEss or tenuous, warm or moist. For the grossness of the air arises from the setting, the approach, and the rising of the Sun. Thus tht: air may be hot or cold, or dry and rarefied, and the degrees of this distinguish summer and winter. v. ANAXAGOKAS says: God and His goodness arc the first principle of all things. Therefore, the mildness of God reigns even beneath the earth, being the substance of all things, and thus also the substance beneath the earth. For the mild-ness of Gqd mirrors itself in creating, and His integrity in the solidity that is beneath the earth. Now we cannot sec His -goodness, except in bodily form. vi. St:::'\\IOK, or l'A:SilOLI'JIUS, says: I make known to posteritr that the thinness, or softness, of air is in water, and is not severed from the other clements. If the earth had not its vital juice, no moisture would remain in it. \\'ii. ARISTlWS delivers himself thus briefly : Know that the earth is round, and not flat. For if it were perfectly flat, the Sun would shine everywhere at the same moment. viii. PYTIIAGORAS: That which is touched and not seen, also that which is knm~·n but not looked upon, these arc only heaven and earth ; 'again, that which is not known is in the world and is perceived by sight, hearing, smell, taste, or touch. Sight shews the difference betwe~n black and white ; hearing, between good and e\\·il ; ta~te, between sweet and bitter ; touch, between subtle and gross ; smell, between fragrant and fetid. ix. AtHsn:us, in his Second Table, says: Heat the body which I have made known to you into thin plates ; pour thereon our salt water, i.e., water of life, and heat it with a gentle fire until its blackness disappears, and it becomes first white, and then red. · x. PAtOIEl\\JllES : The Sages have written about many waters, stones, and metals, for the purpose of deceiving you.

Again, his inward parts, such as the heart, lungs, and liver, arc comparable to the metals. The hairs have their head in the. earth (i.~ .• the ftesh) and their roots in the air, as the Sages say, that the root of their minerals is in the air, and their head in the earth. That which ascends by distillation is volatile, and is. in the air ; that which remains at the bottom, and is fixed, is the head, \\\\•hich is in the earth. Therefore, the one must always exist in conjunction with the other if it is to be effectual. Hence man· may be compared to an inverted tree : for he has his roots, or his hair, in the air, while other trees have their hairs. or their roots, in the earth. And of our Stone, too, the Sages have justly said that it has its head in the earth, and its root in the air. This similitude has a two-fold interpretation. First, with regard to the place in which our :\\latter is fount! ; secondly, with regard to the dissolu-tion and second conjunction of the Stone. For when our Stone rises upward in the alembic, it has its root in the air ; but if it would regain its .virtue and strength, it must once more return to its earth, and then it has its head and perfect potency in the earth. Hence our Stone, too, is not inaptly denominated a small world ; it is called the mountain of mountains, from which our ore is derh·ed, since it is e\\·ol\\'ed from the first substance in a way analogous to that in which the great world was created.

Nor can common sulphur be the fin;t substance of the metals, for no metal contains so much impurity as common sulphur ; and if it be mixed with any metal, that metal becomes c\\·cn more impure than it was before, and is even partially, or wholly, corroded. CHAPTER VI. Again, the Sages affirm that quicksil\\·er, or mercury, is the spirit of the specific nature of metals, collected out of the four clements by the influence of the Planets, and the operation of ~aturc in the earth-and that from it is dc\\'clopcd either ~old, silver, or some other of sc\\·cn metals, according to the peculiar cffc..'Cts of the predominant planetary influence. I lcnce ignorant alchemists h;n·c supposed that all this is true of the common quicksih·er, because it amalgamates with all metals, and is soft and mlatile. But why should its \\·olatile properties pro\\'e it to be no metal ? According to this definition, we might deny the metallic character of tin, lead, and other metals, because they do not remain fixed in a fierce fire-though one can stand a greater degree of heat than another. If, again, any substance is to be called the first substance of metals because of the fi1cilitr with which it amalgamates with them, copper would ha\\'e a better claim to be so regarded, since it enters into a closer union with gold and sil\\'er than mercury, and shares both their fusible and malleable nature.

The rars of the Sun arc tempered with the air by passing through it so a.'> to operate by the medium of the air, as the air operates through the medium of the fire. Earth without water can produce nothing, nor can water quicken anythin~ into growth without earth ; and as rarth and water arc mutually indispensable in the production of fruit, so fire cannot operate without air, or air without fire. For fire has no life without air ; and without fire air possesses neither heat nor dryness. · \\\\'hen its fruit is about to be matured, the vine stands in greater need of the Sun's warmth than in the spring; and if the Sun shine brightly in the autumn, the grapes will be better than if they had not felt his autumnal warmth.

Neither human nor animal bodies can be multiplied or pro· pagatcd without decomposition ; the grain and all vegetable seed, when cast into the ground, must decay before it can spring up again ; moreover, i>utrcfaction impa•ts life to many worms and other animalcula!. The process of au;.:mentation and quick-ening is mf)stly performed in [the) earth, while it is caused by spiritual seed through the other clements. The farmer's wife knows that she cannot hope to obtain chickens except throu;.:h the decomposition of the egg. If bread is placed in honey, and suffered to decay, ants arc generated : worm,; arc bred in the putrefying bodies of men, horses, and other animals ; maggots arc also developed by the decay of nuts, apples, and pears. The same thing may be observed in regard to \\'egetable life. Nettles ami other weeds spring up where no such seed has e\\'er been sown. This occurs only by putrefaction The reason is that the soil in such places is so disposed, and, as it were, impregnated, that it produces these fruits, which is a result of the properties of sitlercal intluence ; consequently the seed is spirituallr produced in the em·th, allll putrelks in the earth, anti by the operation oft he clements generate>~ corporeal matter accol'lling to the ,;pede>~ of l\"ature. Thull the stars ami the clements may generate new spiritual, and, ultimately, new \\'cgctablc seed, by means of putre-faction. Uut man cannot create new seed ; for it is not in his power to. order the operation of the clements and the essential influences of the stars. By natural conditions, however, new plants arc generated simply through putrefaction. This fact is not noticed by the farmer, simply because it is a thing that he has always been used to, and for which he is unable to find an explanation. But you who should know 1hore than the \\'Ulgar herd, must search into the causes of thin;::, and endea\\·our to understand how the process of generation and resuscitation is accomplished by means of decomposition, and how all life is producetl out of decay. Each clement is in its turn decomposed and regenerated by that which is contained in it. For you should know that C\\'ery clement contams the three others. In air, for instance, there is fire, water, and earth. This assertion may appear incredible, but it is nevertheless true. In like manner, fire Digitized by Coogle"},{"pageNumber":356,"pageContent":"THE GOLDEN TRIPOD. 341 includes air, water, and earth, since othenvisc it could generate nothing. Water contains fire, air, and earth;' for if it did not. there could be no growth. At the same time, each clement is distinct, though each contains the others. All this is fou.nd by distillation in the separation of the clements. · ,. '-:. In order to rationally prove this to you, who arc inv.cs~igl,'t~. ing the separation of !\"\\aturc, and purpose to understand the . division of the clements, lest you should think my words inven-• tions, and not true, I tell you that if you distil earth, you will find that, first of all, there is an escape of air, which, in its tum, always contains fire, as they arc both of a spiritual essence, and exercise an irresistible mutual attraction. In the next place, there issues water from the earth, and the earth, in which is the precious salt, remains by itself at the bottom of the \\'esscl. When water is distilled, air and fire issue from it, and the water and material <•arth remain at the bottom. :\\~ain, when the im·io;iblc part of elementary fire is extracted, you get water ami earth by themseh'es. :\\or can any of the tlm:e other clement,; exist without air.

For e\\·erythin~ that is hot and tlry contain:s lire. From these considerations we conchu.le that nu clement can exist without the others, ancl that in the :,:eneration of all thin:,:s there is a minglin:,: of the four clements. lie who states the contrary in no wise understands the secrets of :\\ature, nor has he ill\\'esti~ated the properties of the clements. For if an}'thing is to be ~o:enerated by putrcfacti<m, the process must be as follows : The c.trth is lirst decomposed by the moisture which it contains ; for without moisture, or water, there can be no true Jccay; thereupon the decomposed substance is kindled and quickened by the natural heat of lire: for without natural heat no generation can take place. Again, if that which h.1s receh·cd the spark of life, is to be stirred up to motion and growth, it must be acted upon by air. For without air, the quickened subo;tance would be choked and stifled in the genii. llen('e it manifestly appears th;tt no one clement can work eiTectually without the aid of the others, and that all must contribute Digitized by Coogle"},{"pageNumber":357,"pageContent":"J.p THE HERMETIC AIUSEUM. towards the generation of anything. Thus their quickening co. operation takes the form of putrefaction, without which there can be neither generation, life, nor growth. That there can be no perfect generation or resuscitation without the co-operation of the four clements, you ma)' sec from ·the fact that when Adam had been formed by the Creator out of earth, there was no life in him, until God breathed into him a living spirit. Then the. earth was quickened into motion. In the earth was the salt, that is, the Hotly ; the air that was breatlwd into it was mercury, or the Spirit, anti this air imparted to him a genuine and temperate heat, which was ·sulphur, or fire. Then Adam moved, and by his power of motion, shewed that there had been infused into him a life-giving spirit. For as there is no fire without air, so neither is there any air without fire. \\Vater was incorporated with the earth Thus living man is an harmonious mixture of the ftmr clements ; and ,\\tlam was ~enc.-atcd out of earth, water, air, and lire, out of soul, spirit, allll bod)', oi1t of men:my, sulphur, and salt.

To return again to putrefaction, 0 seeker of the Magistery and dc,·otee of philosoph)•, know that, in like manner, no metallic seed can de\\·clop, or multiplr, unless the said seed, by it~clf alone, and without the introduction of any foreign substance, be. reduced to a perfect putrefaction. The putrefaction of metallic seed must, like that of animal and \\;egetable seed, take rlace through the co-operation of the four clement:>. 1 have :1lready explained that the clements thcm-sch·cs arc not the seed. Hut it ought by . this time to be clear to you that the metallic seed which was produced by the combined operation of heavenly, sidereal, and elementary essences, and reduced into bodily form, must, in due course, be corrupted and putrefied by means of the clements. Observe that this seed contains a living volatile spirit. For when .it is distilled, there .issues from it fit·st a spirit, and then that which is less \\'olatile. But when by continuell gentle heat, it is reduced to an acid, the spirit is not so volatile as it was before. For in the distillation of the acid the water issues first, Digitized by Coogle"},{"pageNumber":358,"pageContent":"TilE GOLDEN TRIPOD. 343 and then the spirit. And though the substance remains the same, its properties have become very different. It is no longer wine, but has been transmuted by the putrefaction of gentle heat into an acid. That which is extracted with wine or its spirit, has widely different properties and powers from that which is extracted with an acid. For if the Cl}'stal of antimony be extracted with wine or the spirit of wine, it causes vomiti:ng and diarrhu:a, because it is a poison, and its poisonous quality is not destroyed by the wine. Hut if it be extract<:d with a good dis-tilled acid, it furnishes a beautiful extract of a rich colour.

The sub. stance is of he:l\\'enly birth, its lik is preserved by the stars, and nourished by the four clements ; then it must perish, and be putrefied ; again, by the influunce of the stars, which works through the clements, it is restore<! to life, and becomes once more a hea\\·-::n!y thin~ that has its habitation in the highest rel-tiun of the firmament.

Out of four, by which we must unc.lerstanc.l the four clements. Out of three, anc.l these arc the three principles of all things. Out <•ftwo, for the mercurial substance is twofolc.l.

Mercury with its own oil. Then we have a twc,fold mercurial substance ; but you must know that gold must first be dissolved · in a certain water, as explained in my second Key, after the purification described in the first Key, and must be reduced into a subtle calx, as is mentioned in the fourth Key. ~ext, this calx must be sublimated by the spirit of salt, again precipitated, and by re\\·erbcration reduced into a subtle powder. Then its own sulphur can more .easily enter into ib .mbstancc, anti ha\\'C great friendship with the same, for they have a wondrous Jove towards each other. .Thus you have two substances in one, and it is called Mercury of the Sages, but is yet a single substance, which is the first icrmcnt. Jllt>W (PIIt><,•s c•mccrning Sulphur. Seck your 1\\fcrcurr in a similar metal. Then when you know how to extract the metal from its body by purification, the destruction of the first :\\Iars, and rc\\·erbcration, without the usc of any corrosh·c (the method of doing which I ha\\·e indicated in my tlurd Kcy)-you must dissolve that l\\lercury in its own blood, out ofwhich it was made before it became lixed (as indicated in .the sixth Key) ; and you ha\\·c then nourished and dissoh-cd the true lion with the blood of the green lion. For the fixed blood of the Red Lion has been made out of the volatile blood of the Green Lion : hence, they arc of one nature, and the unfixed , blood a!,!ain renders that which is \\'Oiatilc fixed, and the fixed biC'Od in its turn fixes that which is \\'olatilc, as it was before its solution. Then foster it in gentle heat, until the whole of the mercury is dissoh·cd, ami you obtain the St't't>lld jinnmt (by nourishing the fixed sulphur with that which is not fixed), as all Sages unite with me in testifying.

For thC!>C two substances arc sin~:ularly efficacious in producing fixation. In the !i.\"lmc way, the ve<,.tetable salt of wint-fixes and ,·olatilizell accon.ling to the manner of its preparation. Its usc is one of thr. arcana of Nature, and a miracle of the philos-opher's art. When n man drinks wine, there may be gained from his urine a clear salt, which is \\'olatile, and renders other fixed substances volatile, causing them to rise with it in the alembic. But the same docs not fix. If a man drank nothin;: but wine, \\'et for all that the salt obtained from his urine woulti ha\\'C a different property from that ~ained out of the Ices of wine. For it has under;:one a chemical d1an~e in the human boc.ly, ha,·ing become transmuted from a vc~ctablc into an animal salt-just as horse~ that ft:ed on oats, straw, etc., chan~c those ve~etable substances into flesh ami fat, while the hce prepares honey out of the precious juices of flowers and herbs. . 'I he ~reat chan~e which takes place in thes<> anti other substances is due to /'llfr,:fircti\"u, which separates and transmut(..'!i the constituent clements. The common spirit of salt, which is extracted according to the direction ~i\\'en in my last declaration, if there be added to it a small 11uantity of the \"spirit of the dr~on,\" dissnl\\'<:s, \\'olatilizes, anti raiSI.'s to~cther with itself in the alembic, ~old and silver ; just as the \" ea~lc,\" together with the spirit ol the dragon (which is found in stony places), before the spirit is separat(..-d from its hotly, is much more powerful in producing fixation than volatility. This I also say, that if the spirit of common salt be joined to the spirit of wine, and distilled together with it, it becomes sweet, and loses its acitlity. This prepared spirit docs not dis-solve golti botiily, but if it be poured on prepared calx of ~old, it extracts the essence of its (:olour and redness.

For the !ipirit of \\'inegar is colt!, and the spirit of lime is intcnsclr hot, and thus the two spirits arc found to be of opposite natures. I do not here speak according to the customary manner of the Sag-es. But I must not say too openly how the inner gates arc to be unlocked. In bidding .farewell, let me impart to rou a faithful word.
