The Hall family moved to theUnited States in 1904 and lived for a time in Sioux Falls, South Dakota. Manly Hall settled in Los Angeles in 1919.As a young man he became interested in occult matters. He subsequently joined a number of societies, among them theTheosophical Society, the Freemasons, the Societas Rosecruciana in Civitatibus Foederatis, and the American Federation ofAstrologers.In 1922 Manly Hall wrote his first book on philosophy/religion, Initiates of the Flame. According to Hall, he began collectingworks on mysticism and the esoteric sciences: \"late in the fall of 1922, the plan for a comprehensive work on thesymbolism of western mystical societies began to take shape in my mind. It soon became apparent that research facilitiesfor such a project were not available in Southern California... The only answer was to contact antiquarian book dealers andelict their cooperation in the search for the items desired.\" The collection of books and manuscripts which Hall purchased,primarily in the 1920s and 1930s, became the basis for his own research and the cornerstone of the Philosophical ResearchSociety's holdings.Ordained to the ministry in 1923, Hall became minister to an occult/metaphysical congregation. As the leader of the Churchof the People, Hall started a magazine titled the All Seeing Eye. In 1928 Hall published his extensive work An EncyclopedicOutline of Masonic, Hermetic, Qabbalistic, and Rosicrucian Symbolical Philosophy.In 1934 Hall founded the Philosophical Research Society, a research institute modeled on the ancient school ofPhythagoras. 1935 marked the ground breaking for the first building of the complex. Major additions to the PhilosophicalResearch Society came in 1950 and 1959. Hall delivered weekly lectures and continued writing on mystical topics. By 1940,Hall is said to have delivered over 7,000 lectures.1944 was the year of the first printing of Hall's book, Secret Destiny of America, apparently an expansion of a lecture hegave in 1942. The Philosophical Library edition of Secret Destiny of America was published in 1958. And in 1986 Hallcompleted his book the Rosicrucians and Magister Christoph Schlegel: Hermetic Roots of America.Manly Hall died in California. During his life he wrote over 50 books and hundreds of shorter works.Scope and Content of CollectionThe collection contains 243 manuscripts, some only a few pages, bound in 68 volumes which detail the arts of Alchemy,Hermeticism, Rosicrucianism, and Masonry. Highlights of this collection include: a twenty-one foot long Ripley Scroll, aheavily illustrated manuscript that records an alchemical poem by Ripley (George Ripley d. 1490); a 17th-century Frenchmanuscript copy of Michael Maier's \"Atalanta Fugiens\" with emblematic and mystical drawings and illuminations after JacobBöhme; an 18th-century Pennsylvania Dutch manuscript of Rosicrucian cosmological charts and symbolic images; twotriangular masonic manuscripts; two independent collections, the first named for Dr. Sigismund Bacstrom, who gatheredtogether an assortment of manuscripts from the 16th to the early 19th century, many of which he translated into English,the second collection, attributed to Count Cagliostro, contains thirty manuscripts bound in one volume.ArrangementArranged in one series according to Hall's inventory list and using the manuscript numbering from Hogart's bibliography ofthe Manly P.
