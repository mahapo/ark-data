So from each exhalation we can prepare a tinging stone, butnot without the reciprocal activity of both.E\"vnori anna shows that running mercury can be concocted from the saltsof plants, and the burning sulphur of an especially oily kind can betaken out of the midst of those substances. And so it follows that thedissolving menstrua of plants are not alien and heterogeneous, but arein close relation to mineral objects and unite with them. Together withthem they should be thought of as reducible to one nature and one ess-ence of a most healthful quality. The Platonic rings and the goldenchain of Homer illustrate just how one thing proceeds from another,and yet all things are interdependent.Nature r er the universal spirit of the world, first among createdthings, channels life and force to the elements by means of influence.Then seed for a1l plants arises from the mixture of elements, and fromthe seed grow the minerals that are closest to the center of the earth.Plants spring up from fine vapours and mineral exhalations; they thenprovide nourishment for animals.

It is there to the extent that it remains universal ,simple, and more or less spiritual in nature. Partly, however, it rn-heres in elements in particular, specific, and corporeal ways. There-fore it is found in growing things particularly in a very fixed andpowerful state.

That is why Lullius considered any stone that is purely andabsolutely mineral to be poisonous. He wrote: \"It would be better fora person to eat basilisk eggs than gold made with fire in an unnaturalway.\" By this fire, he meant all corrosive mineral spirits.It would be an entirely different matter if the fires of nature, whichcomprise all the vegetable spirits of burning waters and the essentialpowers of things' were shown to be unnatural fires only when they con-verge. They are then in a much better and safer condition. For it isimpossible to cross from one extreme to the other without going througha useful and convenient intermediate state. The intermediate state be-tween minerals and our own human nature is composed of plants and ani-mals ' which are much closer and more acceptable to our nature. Forrl^; ^ .:rnrs reason, rf the minerals just mentioned are united and gathered upwith them according to the Iaws of art, many pleasant and agreeabl-e res-ults can be achieved. Under other circumstances, nature does not allowor tolerate such changes so easily. But if this is done using the uni-versal media of the elements - which are simply the closest state ofminerals in regression - each of the elements, fire and water, will beable to bring about great changes. In aII this the authentic methodand suitable procedure must be used, and the operation properly thoughtout.The second point is this. It is quite easy to extract the embodiedspirit of the universe, since it was embodied in aII creatures by theword of God out of the very plants and animals that we have shown tobe nearer and more aqreeable to human nature.

We must look for even the small-est amount of their fixed substance, which then loses a1I its partic-ular character and is reduced to the ultimate purity and simplicityin fact, to fixed and fiery salt.The fixed mineral nature is of no use to us unless it grows and be-comes aIive.

But it can also be made usi-ng other minerals in whichgold lies hidden in potency, though it is incomplete. The followingpoem will clarify this:The Iife of men is brief and breakable as a seal on a letter,yet men come to us, to be protected by our healing skill.But you may wonder how this life can be supported:Which herbs we can look to for help?Turn your eyes and your mind away from combustible substances.Take, choose, and cherish whatever is more fixed.For it is certain that plants, themselves too feebly supported,8."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"cannot extend our short lives.You are more likely to find a helperwhen you dig for minerals in the lap of the earth,In the place where strength from heaven convergesAII at once into balsam and metals flow forth.But if you are captivated by the loveliness of herbs, ifthe gifts that Microcosmus offers delight you,At least take only what in them is fixed,and reave behind whatever is fleeting and cannot survive fire.For at the root they are not able to sustain lifeand quickly perish, just as they quickty yielded whatever theycould.But whatever lasts for a long timeprolongs life, once it has passed through the stages of fire.AII such things are in submission to Vulcan, their master,who purifies them, makes them clearer,Divides and remakes them; and if someoneis rushing headlong into the shadows of cold deathHe restores him to new life.Then they may aII take on, by imitation, the nature of aether,the fifth essence,and be joined to the pure elements in fixed progression.Why - if aII things are already given over to the one liquidthat infuses fruitful life into them aII?In this a new light is risen; virtue is reborn and flashes forth.And in this you may take counsel for your brief life.9."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"We can precisely compare this fixed spirit in each of us: In me, inyou, and in anyone else, whoever he may be. It appears to be noblerand higher than in anything else we have mentioned, not only becausethe subject has been nobly argued, but also because aII the virtues orpowers scattered among animals, plants, and minerals come together ineach human being. And so this bodily spirit of the whole universe,taken either from the very center or from parts of the Microcosm, isrightly considered to be universal.The extraction of this spirit has something to do with the homogen-eous substance of the human beinq. At least j-t does insofar as it isunderstood to be the fabric of its essential parts, the components ofthe human body. It also has to do with what is left over from foodafter the nourishment has been taken out, which is excreted by forceof expulsion as something alien. It is given the name Microcosmic, notwithout due reflection. Here is the reason for this investigation;whatever man takes in as food, whether it is an animal or vegetable, hethen carries inside him as a hidden mineral substance. Since it ismore or l-ess fixed in character, it is clear that it can be consideredvolatile. The more fixed a mineral substance of any kind is, the more':-r':^^^!':r^r ^ it is in the digestive tract. And the more volatile it is,rlrurYsJ LrurE Jthe more digestible. Again, if it is more fixed, it is more healthful;and if it is more volatile, it becomes harmful. The proof of this mat-ter lies in mineral poisons, which pass into the digestion as volatilesubstances and speed up the process of dying.This is the state of affairs. The Archaeus of our digestive tractdivides volatile astral substances from food, but leaves fixed subst-ances completely alone, or at least has as little to do with them as10"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"possible. For these fixed astral substances are teeming with excessmatter that is combustible or that evaporates easily. For this reason,the fixed substances reject what they cannot use, the excrement, andexpels it along with their own husks and the excess matter mentionedabove. So it follows that in such astral substances there is a kinqof fixed and hidden quality of all natural things, and that is the sub-ject of this discussion. Certainly it is something very good, for wechoose only the best and finest things to eat and drink.Another argument in this investigation is as follows. Created things,and growing things, leave behind their specific form in the food in thehuman digestive process. For this reason, the bodily substance thatremains is likelv to revert to its former simcle state. The more it isIaid aside in this manner - the more it is stripped of its familiarnatural form - the simpler it becomes, even tending toward its firstn.i aj n rrn i trar54l nature.

Nevertheless, the transformation andcorruption it undergoes in the human body is so great and so swift thatnothing else in the entire unj-verse could bring it about. But if thereis still something left, clinging tenaciously, it can easily be takenout by calcination. Then it can be restored by other means so that anew body arises in aII its dignity and glory. In regards to this matter,consider common salt. In its own class, it has a place on the list of-':^^--1- -11 of which claim the Luna Philosophtca, philosophic silver,ltttIIgIA!J t qIIas their mother.

The microcosmcontributes nothing material to this process from its own substance,except that its Archaeus separates the pure matter in food from theimpure. Then, in exchange for its former labors, it throws over andabandons these tasks that are necessary for its own nourishment.Because this is too impure for him, and because the separation pro-cess is too hard, he leaves it for someone else who can handle it bet-ter. So in this regard a human being is nothing but a vessel for fireand a furnace for putrefaction, in which the best and noblest substancesof animals and all growing things is dissol-ved and decomposed with re-markable speed. As a result, the artisan is spared considerable trou-bre and expense. As for the substances of the microcosm, the matter robe excretedr lou will not be able to bring either of them into a gen-uine' perfect state of fixity unless you add gold or some other miner-al fire, and you will produce nothing more than a vegetable stone.An example taken from human substances - blood and like can be foundin the Anglimedulq Philosophtoe, of Riplaeus, near the end of the treat-ise on the animal stone.

Thefollowing verses tell about this same element:This earth that you see is not the element,For earth lies hidden in the center of the earthTake this immaculate virgin earth,The one matter of the physical stone.rh.i ct-nnhar Hornius Mesnicus, among others, wrote most elegantly onthis subject.

Behold this rain water,absolutely pure, belonging to the realms of air and aether. It caneasily be combined with its own extremely fine earth, and then it turnsinto the most delicate and perfect of all fires.\" In addition, Arnoldof Villanova left an entire work in the form of a brief testament.

They used the elemental, surface earth as well as itsown hidden salt. In addition, they set up a procedure for using ele-mental objects along with particular ones. Hornius describes it asfollows: \"There is found in salts a great deal of concealed solar form,but the greatest amount is found in earth. Understand the matter thisway: SaIt al-one scarcely contains within itself the life-giving forceof things; that is the property of earth with its own proper salt. \"They took earth, calcined and elemental, along with the ashes of ele-mental things in which salt and earth were still combined. In a sim-ple mineral fire they pounded it, making it lighter and more porousuntil it all turned red. After they extracted fixed FIRE and astralEARTH in the form of red salt, which they called sulphureous salt ofSAIIEd SULPHUR.Here it must be noted that what becomes red in this reverberation orpounding takes on the deepest impression from the fire. For this reason16"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"the two preceding and two following methods offer not only kindted firebut also whatever has been introduced, impressed, joined, and incorpor-ated by means of skilful reverberation.

In this operation, Luna Philosophica of the first, centralkind provides the best help.At last, some philosophers understood that sulphur was found in salteven in virgin earth. So they kept salts, especially the metallic andmineral kinds, stripped of all their sulphur and mercury, in the pro-cess of digestion in fire until they shed their intrinsic properties.Then, during solution and extraction, the salt became as red as the€ira rFha ^h'i-losophers have given the following encomium to this salt:\"The salts of metals comprise the philosophers' stone.\" Now that cen-tral earth has been sufficiently described, we must say something aboutsurface earth, according to our plan.
