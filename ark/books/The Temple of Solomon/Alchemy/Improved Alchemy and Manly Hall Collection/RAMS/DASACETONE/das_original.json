Van Helmont has alreadyproved the error of the Paracelsian system, but held the medica-t ions therein in high regard .My studies of magnetism in r877 led ne to paracelsus,whose thorough medical knowledge of same filled me with admiration.This caused me to further f ami1-iarize myself with his work. Thedarkness of his language made it necessary to look fo'r enlighten-ment by comparing alchemical tracts and treatises. Then I realizeclthat the virtually untouched \" FeLcl den Ankane \" had to be themain goal of culture, and the brilliant healings of Poterius in-creased my interest even more. The intrigue of the mysterious wasa considerable motivator in my investigations. Test after test wasconducted and I was suPported tremendously by those two very scien-tific minded pharmacists, Drs.

Thisin turn was then distilled in a small retort and heated to thepoint of glowing, whereby a yerlow riquid transformed, forrowedby thick white vapors. when the distillate was poured on thewhite sublimate in the neck of the retort, it dissolved the sub-rimate immediately, and some drops of reddish oir separated onthe surface.

It was natural science in its old form. Asa basic rule it was established that all bodies are composed ofthe 3 chemical elements: salt, sulphur, and mercury. The nameswhich are meant only as symbols, and which mean something quitedifferent, would equate with the following in today's terminology:mercury = hydrogensulphur = carbonsalt= oxygenMissing is nitrogen whose existence as a simple element, however,is still doubtful.The theory said that the differences of the metals is basedon the qualitative proportions of these 3 elements, and that throughchanges in these proportions, it is therefore possible to alter themetals up to a perfection of gold and silver. Since the proporti'onsof the mixture were determined only hypothetically, the experimentwas only empirically technicar; but since al1 metars and manyminerals had been used in the experiments, it presented an oppor-tunity for many chemical discoveries which served the sciences ingeneral. The old experts and highfy respected persons, IikeAlbertus Magnus and Roger Bacon, anarogously to the efforts oftoday's science, tended to dismantre the bodies and to createnew connections. The old chemistry, using the transmutation ofthe metals, arrived at no confirmed positive results, whereasmodern chemistry not only calculated the atoms, but also theirabberations.-4-"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"The chemistry, whj-ch was taught freely in Arabic sciencesand which was protected by the caliphs, encountered mistrust andsuspicion with its transition to the Christian worId. It wasderived from the non-believers whose actions were connected withthe world of magic and the devil; it was persecuted by the Church.Working with it was, therefore, socially dangerous, and physicallythe vapors of the minerals and the vast efforts were not advan-tageous for the health. Large incentives were needed to findfollowers and disciples, but they were not scarce. Just as theChurch promises its believers eternal happiness, alchemy promisedretention of health by means of the Lapis and with that a longerIife and large richness or heaven on eartht in addition there wasthe secret with its mysterious appeal. Permeated by the grandeurof their ideal, the alchemists drowned themselves in religiousmysticism; everything started with God and everything was done underhis protection, and only through God's grace and enlightenmentcould the stone of uisdom be obtained.The radical dissolution of the gold, which was caused withoutcorrosives and from which the metal could not be reduced, was thetrue Aur,um potabile, the quintessence.Rupescissa says, \"the quint-essence of the gold is Aurum Dei and part of Lhe Lapis, and it iscompletely transformed into nubriment. The genuine gold is nottransformed into nutniment, but it is excreted in the form in whichit is taken in. Aurum alchymicum, which is composed of corrosives,destroys nature; therefore Ehre Aurum Lapi-dis is called Au.rntm Dei.Paracelsus explains that the quintessence in the gold is veryIittle, but that it has the powere in the eolor, and when it isextracted the remaininq metal has lost its power. It differs fromAurum potahile in as much as it may not be reduced to metallic aold-(-"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"a second time, while the Auvam potabile may be transformed into ametallj-c body; therefore its quintessence is finer.Raimund gives the following eloquent, but complicated state-ment:1. Spit'itus Vini philosophici is distilled three times overSaL Tartari, and this distillation is kept in digestion for 50 days,at the end of which a yellow residue appears on the bottom.2- The gold and'silver are now separately calcined, that isamalgamated and the quicksilver evaporated.3. On the remaJ.nj-ng cal-cinated metal each separately we pourthree fingers'width of the sharp spirit No. L, and then first holdin a water bath, and then in the ash-bath at boiling temperatures.The dj-ssolution of the gold is yeltow and it is carefully decanted;also the dissolution of the silver is green or blue and it is care-fully decanted.4. The residue of the metals is repeatedly treated in the samemanner untj-1 everything is dissolved.5- These solutions are each kept 40 days in digestion; thenthe solvent is distilled-out in a water bath, leaving the metalsbehind just like oils. The distillate is poured back over the oil,left to digest in the water bath for 24 hours and then distilled.6- The distillate is at first gently distilled in a sand bath,whereby the water goes over, then at higher temperatures the spiritgoes over, and even at higher temperatures a part of the oil trans-forms.7. The water that went over at first in the water bath isadded to the distilrate, digested, distilted in the sand-bath,and this is repeated as often as needed to have all the qold andsilver go over.-6-"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"8. The solutions are rectified in the sand-bath 7 times.9- Now both are mixed and circurated for 60 days.with this the great solvent is prepared, which dissolvesall metals radically.Now other gold, which has been amalgamated and calcinedthrough the evaporation of the quicksilver, is digested with thesolvent No. r, and after its distilration it is submersed byMenstruum majus to dissolve the gold. when this is done it is drained.On the residue a fresh Menstruum majus is poured for complete dis-sorution, and that is then combined with the previous one. Thesolution has the color of a most beautiful ruby or carbuncle. rtis circulated for 20 days in a water bath and zo days in an ash-bath. Then you will find the gold transformed at the bottom intobeautifur rosin, and the water on top may be carefurly drained.The rosin is soluble in any liquid. This is the true Auynun potabtle.The procedure is descrj-bed so clearly that with the exceptionof the secret solvent agent it is totally understandable. Note-worthy is that not onry gotd, but also sirver is needed.Rupescissa's procedure is simpler. Gord amalgam is finelyatomized by evaporating the quicksirver, and then after addingAcetum philosophonun it is praced in the sun. This causes an oilfilm on the surface which is taken off as it is forming, and whichis placed into a grass with water. The water is evaporated andthe quintessence of the gold, which contains the highest sweetness,remains.A simirar case shourd be the Essentia dttLcis ofHalle.

The substancewas considered to be too. expensive and it was said that the goldpart hardly amounted to I/8Eh of the price. The gold is, however,the least, but the other expenses and the efforts for the prepara-tion, which keep several people busy year after year, are such thatthe price in comparison with prices of other medications should beset h j-gher.In Crell's records of 1747 the doctor of the orphanage, Dr.Richter, a grandson of the inventor, states that the process willbe revealed in time. I cannot find any news in regard to thisand an explanation is to be expected from Halle.This information is very little, and therefore a more eloquentreport by Wollner (Diss. inang. de Epilepsia ejusque medicanento specificoEssentia dulci.s adpelLato. Lugduni Batauorum 1706, 4.p.22) should be men-tioned. According to him it is prepared from purest gold, whichis so refined that even the simple Spir.Ltus uini rectificatissirm,Ls w:-II-8-"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"dissolve a large amount of it, and then turn ruby-red. Thecharacteristics attributed by chemists to the radically dissolvedAuto potabile are found also in the Essentia dulcis, that is, itcannot for the most part be reduced to a metallic body, but itevaporates like smoke even with medium fire. When a large enoughamount of water is poured onto this essence, it turns turbid atfirst and then a very fine powder sinks to the bottom, which whendried in mild warmth, shows a yellow color and a bitter taste.It is however of such finesse that when added to spirit of wine,it dissolves completely like wax and it represents again theEssentia dulcis in color and taste. This indicates that the colorof the Essentia dulcis originates from this powder or the finestCrocus Auti. When this powder is heated a medium temperature ina glass over coals, there will every once in a while be very finecoins of reduced gold, but the largest part of the residue seemsso dissolved, refined and freed from all metallic chains, that itmay not be reduced to metal because as the powder feels the firethe larger part flies away in smoke, leaving a fine powder whichmay not be reduced either with \"Spiessqlanz\" (antimony glance fstib-nite) or with lead, but which forms a highly red purple coloredsalt when melted with SaL Tartari. This salt will even perpetratethe Tiegel and color it purple on its outside.In 1723 Kleinfelder in Konigsberg issued a statement againstthis essence, saying that it was nothing else but a tincture ofburned sugar, and he said that the sugar tincture that he inventedwas as effective as the Essentia,iuleis, even if it really containedgold. Later it was believed that the black, coaly residue of thepreparati-on, when lengthened with ether to become a reddish-brown-9-"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"tincture, and when mixed with Franzbranntwein, was iuhre Essentiadulcis.It seems that the procedure was done according to Lutlius:an indication for that is the preparation from the brack resi-due in the distilling of the ether. The wrong interpretationmay have resulted from the fact that Lullius calls the substancefor the spit'itus vini philosophiei in many places Nigrun nigrius, and,after the distillation of the acetic salts a black substancelike merted pitch remains. Maybe a spy in the laboratory over-heard something about this btack residue in the retort, andthought to have discovered the \"wine spirit-coal', in it.The earlier hermetics used their acetone in many ways,partially for chemical procedures in connection with acids andsarts, partially for the preparation of medications. From thevegetable substances the quintessence is extracted within 3 hourswhen it (acetone) is used. An interesting observation of Rupes-cissa is that the Larantia through this become more effective andare therefore administered in smaller dosages.Among the rater chemiatrics euercitanus used it for thepreparation of the Antipyreton and a gold tincture, and Agricolatoo manufactured several medications with it without reali zinqthat he already possessed Ehre Menstruum LuLLii, which he desiredso much to obtain.We should mention here:THE HEALII'!G FROI4 PODAGRAwhich the Countof L774, p. 30.Onuphz,io de Maz,seiano teLLs of in his hermetic writingsWhen he suffered a severe case of podagra he-1 0-"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"placed the spirit on the swollen and extremely painful foot, and\"Oh Wonder!\" he says, the pain disappeared and I started to dancefor loY, to the astonishment of my friend.

There-fore he went to see him in England to discuss the solvents and themedications of Paracelsus, as well as to discuss other secrets.Boyle accepted him well, praised his studies, and therefore increasedhis ambition for higher achievements.It is noteworthy that this Spiritus Vini philosophzcd, whose com-position has been clearly given by Weidenfeld, is not mentioned bythe later chemists. Only Pott ( Ererc. chgm. Berolini 1738. 4. ) p. 2Ldescribes it with the following words: There is an oily rnenstruttnwhich has not been named yet, and which has not been revealed byany chemi-st. It is a pure, light-colored, VolatiIe liquid like thewine spirit; it is oily and burns with a bright flame; it tastessour like strong vinegar.

Withthe big triumvirate Stahl, Boerhaave and Hoffmann, pharmaceuticalchemistry reached its peak; the arsenal was weII equipped. Thepharmacists lent a helping hand to the doctors, and since the doctorscould rely on them, slowly more work was left to them, and only insingle instances would doctors work with research and preparationof chemical medications. The upswing in botanics by Linne, in thepathological anatomy by Morgagni, in physiology by Haller, and inchemistry by Lavoisier, led the doctors into other fields whichpromised rich harvests on Iittle worked grounds. The pharmacyfollowed the immense progesss in chemistry quickly, and achievedan importance which was favored and supported by the governmentand the doctors. The rights of pharmacists were generously out-lined and the secured lifetime position increased the performanceand the scientific eagerness of this class. The technical chemistrydeveloped further, however, and led to the installation of chemicalfactories, thus changing the whole situation. The advantageousposition of the pharmacists and the easy procurement of the pre-parations from the factories, where the time- and money-consuminglab work cou1d largely be saved, caused cheating with the pharmacies.-16-"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"The prices tripled and quadrupled.A pharmacy that was worth20,000 Th1r. guaranteed to its owner a good income; the newbuyer paid 40,000 Th1r., and now the interest on the additional20,000 Thlr. had to be worked out too. That caused consistentcomplaints in regard to insufficient taxes, interference withrights, and shortage of protection.As much as the government tried to help by increasing thetaxes of medication and work, the complaints continued becausewith increasing income the prices of the pharmacies rose and withthat the i-nterest for the anti-natural additional capital.The Prussian government tried to limit the growing power ofthe pharmacist-order in IB10 by issuing concessions to a personfor the newly built pharmacies. In the newly acquired Frenchprovinces, all privileges had already been lifted and there wereonly concessions. I^lith time, the dif ference between a concessionand a privilege disappeared, and the government by \"highest order\"of J-842 reacquired the free disposition of the government overthe concessions. After that it was determined: 1) the conces-sionaire is obliged to take over the supplies, etc. , according totheir tax value, i.e., according to their real worth; 2) a com-petition was to be held and the government reserved the right togive the concession to the most qualified pharmacist.This was ideal. The concessions herewith became civil servicejobs and it was in the government's hands to unite the most talentedand ambitious pharmacists in a brilliant scientific chain-work,just as it was doing with the other state employees.The means for the execution, however, was never used; itconsisted in setting the price of the concessions according to-I7 -"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"the appraised value and to adjust the tax accordingly, so thatthe amount would be sufficient, but not exorbitant. The pharma-cists already holding concessions argued vividly against thissupposed limitation of their rights of property, and alreadyafter four years the government gave in, put the ideal aside, andwent back to the old, narrow ways.Since then things have continued to deteriorate. The pharma-cies have sunken to mere industrial installations. As industrialenterprises they also carry the risks of such an installation, andthe government has no obligation toward the country to support andto help that stock market game. The need of the time has re-established the power of the government. The feudal rights inAustria, the real rights of businesses in Bavaria were abolishedwithout damages,'and in Prussia too, the tax freedom of the. \"Knightestates\" was eliminated through an appropriate rel-ease payment.In one example I was able to observe the way in which theconcessions were handled. A speculating pharmacy helper appliedto establish a pharmacy in a village, but was denied permission.He told me openly that it was not his intention to keep the phar-macy, but that after a few years during which he would create abooming business, he would have sold it, expecting a profit of61000 ThIr., with which he would have been able to start somethingnew.In this situation of the pharmacies where the lab has lostits old, honored significance, the doctors are earnestly remindedto concern themselves again with the preparation of chemical medi-catj-ons.

Thecomplaints concerning the unreliability of the medications andthe deficiencies of the therapy wilI disappear because they aredue to the fact that most of the young doctors lack the practicalknowledge of the medications. They don't know their weapons, andtherefore don't know how to use them.Surgery has a large assortment of instruments available. Nosurgeon has been before an anvil; but the steelworker manufacturedall instruments, but none of them has invented any. But the surgeonin his mind invented the instrument according to his needs and thesteelworker only executes the surgeon's idea. Just like the sur-geon who cannot be without the instrument maker, the doctors can-not be without the pharmacist; but both are only helpers, notleaders. The wrong approach, where the pharmacist pushed himselfinto a leader's position, has brought great damage to practicalmedicine. Many of our best medications originated in the old days,and their application today is based upon the recommendation and'previous observation. The intended supposed improvements of theformulas are frequently nothing but falsifications. Another mis-take was the change in names of the medications and the adaptationof the respectively reigning chemical theory. Hufeland requestedin the name of the practical doctors that the old names be kept,but the governing pharmacy found that to be below its scientifichonor, and only with special consideration did they compromise toadd it in parenthesis.

Due to this homogenity, the solvents of the adeptsdiffer from the ordinary solvents in as far as they stay with thedissolved materials and together with them are transformed into athird (therefore a chemical solution).The Spiritus Vini philosophici appears in two forms, either as anoit floating on the top, or as ordinary wine spirit that mixes withthe phlegm, but that may be separated by simple distillation, andthat when ignited after rectification, will burn: they are, however,not two, but only one, different only in fineness ancl purity.

Ammonium sulfide heavy black deposit.2. Po tassium ferrocyanide greenish discoloration; addingof potassium ferriccyanide brought no changes.3. Potassium ferriccyanide immediately a blue color whenheated the brue flaked and the liquid turned grass-green.4. The Berlin-blue obtained with the potassium-cyanide turnedto grass-green when potassium ferrocyanide was added.5. The black deposit obtained through the ammonium-sul-fideis dissolved in hydrochloric acid; nitric acid is added to oxidatethe ferrum, and the result is a yellowish liquid.
