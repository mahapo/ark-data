The causeof this difficult ingress is solely the preparation of the $ i\"f+I where a mistake must have been made.A11 other imperfect metals can also be improved in the samemanner. As t\"n.rd= Qflana Q , they must above all be separatedifrom their combustible sulphur. This done, it is possible toachieve wonderful metallic transformations of great profit, &sit is more than certain that all transformations made with thephilosophical $ will wetl agree with the metals of their nature.+Becasue they consisted of metallic water prior to their coagulation,before they were cooked into perfect or imperfect metals afterthe puritication of their Elements, they can also be refined withthe same ! produced out of g r ds everything must again passthrough the same ways by which it had obtained its prime nature,before it can be regenerated and processed to the state of per-fection.-1 96-"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"CHAPTER VIHOI{ OUICKSILVER CAI{ BE REFIIIED II{TO G()LD OR SILVERAlthough guicksilver is an unripe metar consisting of pre-cisely the Elements of whichQand D \"t\" made, it can never-theless easily be transformed into O \"r e , yet hermaphrodi-ticaIIy, if its Elements are previously purified, boiled, (or:cooked), and fixed (or: stabilized) . This can be done afteradding a ferment to it in order to determine its Erementsr oralso, by marrying its Body with the Soul, of a fixed metal. Thenone will have a fixed metal, stable in all tests without any lossof silver. This can be done in various ways, of which the na-tural, easiest and best are the following two, which we intendto communicate to those who will take the trouble to work afterour principles.First Methodrf the soul of a perfect Body is to be imptanted into theBody of the Htt, take the white of several eggs and whisk itwerl to make it clear as water. sprinkle it on pieces of cinna-bar the size of an olive kerner and rorr them over filed O otO , according to the metal into which the 9 t\" to be trans-formed.

Do this till the pot is compteteryfilled, To each pound of cinnabar pieces at ]east z pounds offine metal must be taken.As soon as the stratification has been done, the pot mustbe sealed, and when the Lutum is quite dty, the pot must be buriedin sand contained in another iron pot and standing on a distilla-tion oven. A gentle A is given from above for 24 hours. Thenit is allowed to coor of its own. The pot is opened after thesand has cooled, when the cinnabar pieces wil-l have been meltedit melts just as easily as other lead it will result in a fixedmetal that can stand all assays.Because the fine metal will lose its Soul in this work, itwill be somewhat lighter. Therefore, if it is to be brought backinto a metallic Body, it must be dissolved in Siur V, and af-+ter a putrefaction of 24 hours the menstruum must be distilledfrom it. The rest is to be put into molten O . Thus this filedmetal, after it has been ensoul-ed Uv H whcih has restored its'+weight, and made corporeal through the gold bath, wi1l bring inconsiderable gain. But if the disensouled (or: unanimated, dead,lifel-ess) metal should be melted, it wil1 be found that more thanhalf of it is burnt, and the profit will be very littIe. If rhecinnabar pieces have been well stratified in a potr ES said above,but one does not wish to put them in a sand A \"\"\"ording to ourmethod, one can do the following.Put the pot on iron bars, five thumbs a$ray from the A .

When theA has gone out and thePot is cold, the cinnabar pieces will be found quite transformedin the same manner as indicated above. This work must be con-tinued tilt a fixed metal is obtained.There are lovers of this hermetic science who boasted be-fore us that they were able to restore the Soul to this dis-souled metal by amalgamating it with .o**o., $ , stratifying thisYwith white lead, and thus cementing it in a well sealed cruciblefor several hours.

However, in so doing, the fl i\"r minez,a would be totally+1ost. Because, as it is again reduced into a metarlic body, itspores are brought together much moie closely, which causes alIthe spiritual it contains to return to its sphere, and thus theElements are determined through the corporealization. From thattime on, its qualities could no longer be distinguished from thoseof the other metals. In addition, it would lose the power it hadpreviously had to act upon the Body of I , and it would not re-+tain the least power with which to intermix with it, boil it downand bring it into action, let alone congeal it into a good metal.For it is impossible that one bbdy can act upon another withoutthe aid of an agent for bringing these two bodies into action.These then are the noblest and most naturaL ways and secretsthat can be used in this PantieuLar-phiLosophg, which we have citedin this part in the shortest and clearest mannerr so that he whohas but a little knowledge of the common chymical practice and isready to folIow our method litera11y, practicing it only in theoven of which we have put a copperplate engraving at the end of-201-"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"this book, will guite easily reach his desired goal and gatherthe fruits of his rabor with great surprise.
