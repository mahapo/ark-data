It is not improper to say the same of the truephilosopher-chymists, since they did speak wisely and left honestnames and splendid writings. They were also rich and had greatpossessions, and their praise will not go under. People speak oftheir wisdom, and the community proclaims their praise.Because their names are to live eternally and the communityis to proclaim their praise, I have felt catled upon to printthe following two treatises for these reasons:First: so that God's great wisdom wnd wonders might bespread further and His name be praised thereby, accordingf to thestatement of the wise man: \"My lips shall praise Thee when Thouteachest me Thy wisdonr.

The philosopher must follow Nature in his work.Nature progresses in shaping and carrying out her work bybringing a thing to its final perfection from the beginning ofits birth through various meansr ds if by degrees. That is whyshe proceeds slowly, and she reaches her goal step by stap andnot by leaps and bounds. Nature decides and determines her workwhich she undertakes between two extremes set apart by many meansand differences. In its works and in order to search into andproduce the Blessed Stone, the philosophical practice, which isNature's monkey, must not deviate from Nature'S example, becausewhat is done outside of Nature's way is a mistake, or not far fromit.The Stoners extremities are the natural quicksilver and theperfect Elixir, but the intermediate means, with the help of whichthe work advances, dEâ‚¬ threefold: either pertaining to the matter,to the effect, or to the specific signs.

From the second,the third means are produced, namely both kinds of Sulphur, whosemultiplication ends the work. The fourth and last means are theweighted ferments and ointmnets obtained by mixing the above-men-tioned, which are produced one after another in the work of theE1ixir.

It boils the fermentby degrees; it makes the uncooked crude ripe and the bitter sweet.At last it gives birth to the flowing, penetrating and tingingErixir, compretes and perfect it, and raises it to the very high-est sublimity.The means, or signs, are colors which appear and follow oneafter the other in a specific order. They are indicative ofthe stage which the process has reached. There are especiallythree colors which shourd be noted as criteria. some add afourth. The first is the brack, which is calIed the Raven,sHead on account of the great brackness which prevails. whenthe work is becoming black, it is an indication that the fireis attacking Nature and beginning the dissolutj-on.

It is not without danger, which can onlybe averted by a downpour from heaven.The Stone is raised by successj-ve digestions as by degrees,and finally it attains its perfection. Four digestions, whichare in accord with the four above-indicated effects or regirnens,complete the whole work. These effects are accomplished by thefire, which also causes their differences.The first digestion produces the dissolution of the body,by which the first conjunction of man and woman and the minglingof both seeds take place. Putrefaction, the resolution of theElements into a homogeneous water, the eelipse of the sun andthe moon in the dragonts head, finaIly, the whole world's re-gression into the oId void and dark abyss.

The light begins to shiner ds does the separationof the waters from the water. Sun and Moon are renewed.

But the fixed and the vo-latile are perfectly mixed and united in the spirit. This can-not take place unless the fixed body has before been dissolvedand made volatile. The reduction fixed the volatile bodlz intoa lasting body, just as before the fixed was changed into a vo-latiIe and the volatile nature can at last become fixed. Butas long as the two natures are united in the spirit, the thusintermixed spirit has an intermediate nature between the bodyand the spirit: fixed and volatile.The production of the Stone is an example of the creationof the world. Because it is necessary that it, too, has itschaos and prime matter in which the intermixed Elements floatuntil they are separated gy the fiery spirit. When they arethus separated, the light one is driven above and the heavy be-Iow. When the light rises, darkness recedes. The waters gather-1 20-"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"into one and the dry appears. Finally, two great lights comeforth one after another, and in the philosophical Earth areproduced the virtues of minerals, plants, and animals.The Lord God created Adam out of a lump of earth in whichthe powers of all the Elements were implanted, especially inthe Earth and the Water, which are more apt to form a body anddo so more tangibly. Into this dough God breathed a vital airand made it come to life withrthe sun and the Holy Ghost. Hegave Eve to the man as his wife, blessed them and gave them thecommand and the power to multiply. This creation of Adam is notunlike the birth of the Philosophers' Stone. Because an earthlyand heavy body, dissolved in water, first turns into a lump orclump to which the name Adamic Earth rightly belongs. In it arecontained the virtues and powers of all Elements. Finally, theheavenly soul is infused into it by the spirit of the Quintessenceand the solar influence, and by the blessing of the dew of heavenit is given the virtue and power to multiply through the union ofmale and female.The greatest secret of this work lies in the manner of oper-ating, which totally depends on the nature of the Elements, be-cause the matter of the Stone passes from one nature to another.The Elements folIow one another in the process, but each is pushedby the cycle of moist and dry tilI they are all turned down andrest there.In the work of the Stone the other Elements are circulatedin the form of waterr ds the Earth is dissolved into water which-I2I-"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"contains the other Elements.

The Earth, however,is the grave of all of them and their urtimate end or goaI.The order of Nature requires that every birth begin out ofthe moist and in the moist. rn the phirosophical work Naturehas to be put in orderr so that the matter of the stone, whichis earthly and dense or sorid and dry, be first of all_ dissolvedinto the next Element t ot water, and may frow in it. Then sa-turn is born out of the Sun.water, driven through seven cycres, is forrowed by the Airwhich is driven hither and thither in the wind by as many cyclesas are required to congeal it below. Jupiter is born after Sa-turn, by whose arrivar the philosophical child is formed andnourished in the womb, and is at last born with a white and clearface like the brightness of the moon.The fire of Nature, which achieves as much as the fire ofthe Elements, will be drawn from its hidden place when it drivesthe externar fire. Then the crocus tinges the IiIy. The cheeksof the child - which has become stronger become red. The crownis prepared for the future King. This is the accomplishment ofthe first work, the perfect reversal of all the E1ements.

Thus all the Elements rest atlast in the Earth and are tranquil in it.The fire contained in the Stone is the Archeus of Nature,the Son of the Sun, and the Regent who moves and digests thematter and executes in it everything as soon as he obtains hisfreedom, for he lies hidden powerlessly under a hard crust.Therefore, give him his freedomr so that he may serve you will-ingly, but take care not to drive him unduly because he wouldsuffer such tyranny and fly away without leaving you any hopefor his return. Therefore challenge him with great gentlenessand preserve him well and with caution.The first mover is the external- fire, the moderator of theinner fire and the whole work. Therefore the philosopher mustbe well acquainted with its regulation. He must well take careof the degrees and points, for in them rests the progress andsuccess of the work, or its ruin and corruption. Thus the Artassists Nature, but the philosopher is the servant of both.With these two tools, Nature and the Art, the Stone rapidlysoars from the Earth into heaven and faIls back again upon theEarth, because the trarth is its nurse. And when it is broughtinto the belly of the Air, it takes on the power of the superiorand the inferior.The circulation of the El-ements is done by two kinds ofwheels, a big and extended one and a small or contracted one.The extended wheel congeals all Elements in or upon the Earthand its cycle is not finished before the work of the Sulphur is-r 23-"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"accomplished. The revolution of the smaIl wheel ends with theextraction and preparation of each Blement. In this, however,there are three cycles which, through a constant and intricatemotion, keep on d.riving the matter away and frequently - atleast seven times spin each Element around, so that they fol-low each other in the proper order and harmonize in such a waythat if one is lacking, the work of the others is altogether invain. These are the chief tools of Nature by which the Elementsare prepared. The natural philosopher should therefore considerthe process in the physical treatise, which is described in de-tail for this purpose.Each single cycle has its own motion, but the motion of allcycles deals with the subject of the moist and the dry. There-â‚¬ara thorr:ro [6pnqf together wiht chainsr So that they may pro-e..eJduce one single effect and one single natural accord. Two ofthem are opposites on account of their goals as also of thecauses and effects, because one moves upward to dry by heat,the other moves downward to moisten by co1d. But the third islike sleep and causes both to rest through digestion.Of the three cycles, the first is the emptying, which isthe action of removing the excessive moisture and also of separ-ating the pure and subtle from the gross earthly slime. But thereis great danger in the motion of this cycle, because it deaLs uithsptritual things and is far aboue Natuz'e.In the motion of this cycle two things must be avoided:First, that it moves too much or too violently; secondly, that-L24-"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"it moves too 1ong. rf it moves too viorently, it causes con-fusion in the matter, so that the impure gross and undigestedpart flied away together with the pure and subtle, and the un-dissolved body flies away with the dissolved one, blended withthe spirit. In the fast motion the heavenly nature is blendedwith the earthly, and the spirit of the euintessence becomesbrunt and powerless by the admixture of the Earth. A srow mo-tion causes the Earth to become atr too emptied and thus power-Iess, barren, and. emptied of its spirit, so that it cannot easilybe made to recover. Both errors either burn the tincture or driveit away altogether.The second cycle is the replacement, the aim of which is torestore the powers of the weakened body and to give it a drink.The first cycle caused sweat and rabor, this one gives healingand refreshment. The purpose of this action is to crush and sof-ten the Earth as the potters do, so that it can be brended alrthe more easily.The motion of this cycre must be lighter and gentler thanthat of the previous, especially at the beginning of the reso-lution, to prevent the young ravens from drowning in their nestin too much water, and their world from being deluged. rt isthis cycle that measures the water and investigates the mass:because it distributes the water according to geometrical laws.It is considered that in the entire work and practice there isno greater secret than the precisely and correctly measured mo-tion of this cycle, because it gives form to the young philoso--r25-"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"phical child and breathes soul and body into it.The laws of motion in this cycle demand that it run slow-ry and leisurely and that its water be poured out sparingly,so as not to diverge from the right mass by rushing and attack-ing the inner fire with too much water. This inner fire is theright fonenan of the uoz.k, not blunt or weak or even altogetherextinct. Food and drink are to be tendered one after another,so that the digestion is done all the better and the dry is wellblended with the moist, for the indissoluble conjunction of bothi e t-ho an>] -rf the work. Therefore take care to add as muchmoisture as is removed by the dryr so that the strengthening ofthe lost powers may restore as much as the emptying had takenthrough weakness.Digestion, the last cycle, takes place with a still and al-most intangible motion. That is why the philosophers say thatit is done in a secret furnace which cooks the accepted food andtransforms it into the members of the body. rt is thereforecalled a putrefaction, because just as food is corrupted in thestomach before it turns into blood and is distributed to all mem-bers, this operation corrupts and putrefies somewhat by a diges-tive and stomachic heat, to make it adhere alt the more or becongealed all the better, and to be transformed from a mercurialinto a sulphurous nature. In addition, it is also caIled inhuma-tion or interment, as through it the spirit is interred and buriedlike a dead man. But because it disappears very sIowly, it re-quires more time. The first two cycles work especially in the-r26-"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"dissolution, this one on the coagulation, although arl threeeffect both.The raws of this cycle require that it be driven or movedwith a febrile, slow semi-heat, to prevent the volatile fromflying away and the spirit from being disturbed when it is to-taIly united with the body. That is why great care must betaken that the Earth be not disturbed by winds and rain. Finally,just as this third cycle alwasy follows the second in the correctorderr So the second follows the first. Thus the three cycles,by ceaseless and yet successive operation, perform a perfect cir-culation which, after being frequently repeated, transform every-thing in the Earth and make peace among enemies.Nature needs fire and so does the Art, following her ex-ample as a tool and hammer to forge her works. In the opera-tion and work of both, fire is the master and manager. There-fore the science of the fire is very necessary to a philosopher,without which he will revolve the wheel of Nature in vain, justlike a second r\"ionl) .The word \"fire\" is understood in various ways by the philo-sophers. Sometimes it is used metonymically for heat, such as\"as much heat, ds much fire.\" Nature knows three kinds of firein the generation of metals and plants: a heavenlyr Errr earthly,and an inner. The first flows into the earth from the sun asits origin. It moves the mercurial and sulphurous vapors out ofwhich metals are generated, and intermixes with them. It movesand stirs the fire of plants which lies like dead in their seedA figure of Greek mythology who was condemned to ceaselessbut futile labor.r)-r27 -"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"andforto which it flashes rays of fire as spores to vegetationtheir plant 1ife.The second fire lies hidden in the earth. By its stirringand action the vapors of the earth rise and are pushed throughsmaIl hores and tubes, and driven from the center upward to thesurface of the earth. This is done both for the generationof metals where the earth is mountaj-nous and for the generationof plants. It makes their seed ready and suitable for genera-tion by putrefaction and softening.The third fire is born of the first, the solar fire, toge-ther with the thirsty metallic vapor. It is covered by the Men-struum, becomes thick together with the moist matter and is keptimprisoned in the latter's power, or rather, it is attached tothe mixture Iike a form. But implanted in the seed of plants,it adheres to the seed tiII it comes or is led out, stirred bythe sharpness of its father's rays. Then it moves, stirs, andthus forms the matter from within, becoming the fashioner andbuilder of the mixture. But in animal generation this heavenlyfire acts together with the animal, though it cannot be felt.For it is the prime active power of Nature. But the woman'swarmth is like the earthly warmth inasmuch as it putrefies, dis-solves, and prepares the seed. The fire implanted in the seed,however, the Sun's Son, disposes the matter, and when it is dis-posed, he also fashions it.In the matter in which they work, the philosophers can ob-serve three fires, a natural and a nonnatural one, also an anti--1 28-"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"natural one. They call the natural fire the heavenly spirit.It is implanted and preserved in the deepest ground of the mat-ter and quite firmly bound up with it. The power of the metalsrenders it mute and duII until it is moved, stirred and releasedby the philosophical Art and external heat and has obtained thepower to move a dissolved bod.y. Then it fashions its wet matterby expanding, penetratirg, unfolding, and coagulating it. Inevery mixing the fire of Nature is the beginning of heat and mo-tion.They call nonnatural fire that which comes from the outsideand is introduced into matter by strange tricks, so as to increaseits natural powers. But they call antinatural fj-re that whichputrefies the whole eompositum and destroys the moderation ofNature. It is imperfect because it is unsuj-table for birth. Itcannot overcome corruption. Such a fire or heat is that of aMenstruum, and it is improperly called an antifire, for it issomewhat naturalr ds it corrupts and spoils only the intact spe-cific form, that is matter, to make it ready and suitable forbirth.It is more believable, however, that the corrupting antina-tural fire is not different from the inner one, but is its firstdegree. Because the order of Nature requires that corruptionprecedes birth. That is why the inner, with-Nature-agreeingfire accomplishes both. ft stimulates two things in Nature,first, to achieve a slow corruption by a gentle heat, and to pre-pare the body. Secondly, to arouse a much stronger fire of great--L29-"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"er heat for birth, to give life to the elementary body whichhas been disposed by the first fire, and to fashion it. totally.That is why a double motion of a double degree of heat is used,and this should not be considered two different fires. Thename antinatural fire, however, is given much more rightly tothe corruptive fires.By successive degrees of digestion the nonnatural- fire ischanged into a natural or implanted one and is increased. Thewhole secret consists in the increase of the natural fire which,because it is simple, cannot act beyond its powers or bestow aperfect tincture to an imperfect body. It is self-sufficientbut has nothing to give. When it is increased by the nonnaturalfire, however, it acts more vigorously and extends far beyondthe boundaries of Nature. It tinges foreign and imperfect bo-dies and makes them perfect due to the greatness of the tincturesand the hidden treasure of the increased fire.The philosophers also call their water a fire because it isvery hot and contains a fiery spirit. It is also called a firebecause it burns imperfect metals more than conrmon fire. For itdissolves them perfectly, while they resist our fire and cannotbe dissolved by it. This is the reason why it is also called aburning water. But the fire of the tincture is hidden in thebe1ly of the water and manifests by a dual effect: the dissolu-tion of the body, and the increase.Nature uses two kinds of fire in her workr dn outer and aninner. The first is the seed of all things, implanted in the-1 30-"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"intermixed ones and hidden in their center. It moves and makesits body come arive, being the starter of life and motion. Butthe second, namery the outer fire, awakens the first from itssleep, just as if it were poured from heaven or earth, and itimpers it to act. Because the live little sparks implanted inthe seed reguire an outside mover whereby they are moved and be-gin to act.Likewise in the philosophical work. The matter of the Stonehas its inner fire which is partry innate, partly added to it bythe phirosophical process. These two combine and get togetherinside because they are of the same kind. The inner needs theouter which the philosopher dispenses according to the laws ofthe Art and Nature. The outer incites the inner to move. Thesefires are like two wheels where that which is concealed is slowlyor quickly pushed and moved by the tangibre wheel. Thus the Arthelps Nature.The inner fire holds a middle position between mover andmatter. That is how it happens that while it is being moved bythe former, it in turn moves the latter. If it is strongly dri-ven, it will in turn drive strongly. The whole shaping of thework consists in the mass of the external fire.Whoever does not know the degrees and points of the externalfire should leave the philosophical work alone. For he will neverbe able to bring light out of darkness if the work does not passthrough the heat by points and degrees, just like the four Elementsof which the external ones are transformed by the central ones.-13r-"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"Since the whole work rests on the separation and perfectpreparation of the four Elements, â‚¬ts many degrees of the fireare required, because each Element is extracted with its owngrade of fire.We speak of four degrees of the fire: that of the bath,of ash, of coal, and fire itself which is also called the op-tetie. Each degree has its points, usually only two, sometimesthree. The fire must be driven carefully, as through points.It is thereby decreased or increased so that the matter, justlike Nature, ildy proceed to its formation and perfection, asit were, of its own. For Nature does not abhor anything as muchas what is done with violence. Therefore the philosopher mustcarefully consider the slow departure and approach of the sun,whose light of the whole world imoarts its warmth to the groundaccording to the seasons and their destination, and gives themtheir temperature.The first point of the heat of the bath is called the fever-warmth or the warmth of manure. The second point is the bath it-se1f. The first point of the second degree is the heat of ashes.The second point is the heat of sand. The fires of coal and offlames actually have no proper points but are distinguished inthe understanding according to the strength or gentleness ofthe fire.In the works of some philosophers we read only of three de-grees of the fire, the bath of ashes and of fire which comprisesthe coal and flame baths simultaneously. The heat of manure is-132-"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"sometimes distinguished from the degree of the bath. Thusthe philosophers confuse the light of the fire with atr sortsof words, for its knowredge counts among the noblest secrets.Because in the hthite Work only three Elements are extrac-ted, only three fire-degrees are required. The fourth, thatis the optetieus, is reserved for the fourth Element whichbrings the pure work to its end. The first degree causes theeclipse of the sun and Moon. Through the second, the light ofthe sun and the Moon is renewed. Throuqh the third, the l{oonobtaines its fulI 1ight. Through the fourth, however, the sunis elevated to its highest honor. But in each part the fire isadministered by geometrical ruler so that active and passivecorrespond with the disposition, and their powers appear inequal measure.The philosophers have assiduously hidden their fire, andhave barely touched on it. They point to it more by writingabout its properties than by indicating its names. Thus theysay that there is an airy fire, a vaporous, a moist, and a dry,a bright, and an astrar one, which can easily be j-ncreased ordecreased by degrees at the discretion of the artist. whoeverwishes to know more about the fire will get satisfaction in thebooks of LuLLius who has truthfully revealed the secrets andpractice to sincere hearts.The fight of the Eagle with the Lion has been described invarious ways. Because the lion is the strongest of all animals,it is necessary that many eagles get together to subdue him - at-1 33-"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"least three or more, up to ten. The less there are, the harderthe struggle and the slower the conquest. The more eagles thereare, however, the shorter the fight and the prompter the tearingup of the lion. In LuLLius, seven eagles are said to be best,but nine in Senior.The vessel in which the philosophers cook their work is oftwo kinds: one of Nature, the other of the Art. The vessel ofNature - which also has the name \"vessel of Nature\" - is theEarth of the Stone r ot the woman, or also the mother in whomthe man's seed is conceived, corructed and readied for birth.The vessel of Nature, however, is threefold, because the secretis cooked in a threefold vessel.The first vessel of the Art is made of transparent stoneor of stone glass. Some philosonhers have concealed its formin a puzzling description: Now of two parts, that is, a retortand an alembic, now of three parts drawn above and held togetherby an added cover, be it said.The variety of these vessels they say is necessary for thephilosophical work, and to conceal them they have called them byall kinds of names according to the different operations. Thoseused for the dissolution thelz call Solutonia; those used for pu-trefaction, Putnefaetoz.ia; for distillation, Distillatoriai forsublimation, SubLinatoria; for calcination, Caleinatoria, etc.But without saying an untruth, one vessel is enough to doand complete both works of the Sulphur, and another is requiredfor the work of the Elixir. The different digestions do not re--1 34-"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"quire different vessels. yes, one should rather take greatcare that the vessel not be changed or oDened before the com-pletion of the first work.The form of the grass vessel or the retorts must have anoval bottom, the neck must be bent over or crooked, one hand'sbreadth or more, sufficiently wide with a narrow mouth, likean unbroken smooth surface, everywhere thick and sturdy enoughto enable it to stand long-Iasting and sometimes simultaneousfires. The alembics are called blind because thev are closedhermetically to prevent anlzthing extraneous from entering themand the spirits from going up in smoke.The other vessel of the Art is a wooden one, made of a blockof oak divided into two half, hollorved balls in which the philo-sophical Egg is warmed and nourished till the young bird appears.See Fonte Treuisan.Alchemists call the third vessel their stove. It preservesthe other vessels, the matter, and the whole work. This thephilosophers have also endeavored to hide.The stove which preserves the secrets is called athanor be-cause of the everlasting fire in its keeping. rt provides thework with a constant though varying fire which has to be consi-derably increased or decreased according to the amount of thematter or the size of the stove.The stove should be made of baked stones t ot fat soil, orstove-earth, well- dissolved and intermixed with hair to make itstick together more firmly and stiffly and to prevent it from-l 35-"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"bursting in long-lasting heat. The walls must be three orfour fingers thick, so as to enable them both to preserve theheat and to resist it.The form of the stove should be round, its inner heighttwo foot. rn the middle there shourd be an iron or copper prate,round, thick like the back of a knife. rt should take up almostall of the inner width of the stove, but a little narrower, sothat it does not touch the walIs. rt shourd be placed on threeor four props attached to the waIIs, with many holes to faciri-tate the rising of the heat through them and the sides of thestove.Under the iron plate there has to be a ho1e, and anotherone above it. Coal is put on the fire through the lower, andthrough the above one can test or feel how the fire is, strongor mild. Opposite these holes there should be a small windowfitted with a glass through which the colors can be seen. Inthe center of the plate put the secrets' tripod with a threefoldcask. Fina11y, the stove must always be covered with its attachedcover, and the holes must well be closed to prevent the heat fromescaping.Now you have everything required for the work, whose goal isthe birth of the double Sulphur. The composition and processingof both is done as follows: Take a red dragon, the stout-hearted,aggressive one, whose birthday does not lack in strength. Afterthis, seven or nine noble Eagles, Virgins whose sight does notweaken before the sunbeams chose those. Throw the birds with-t 36-"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"the wild animal into a clear prison which must be well closed.Put a Bath under them to rouse them to battle with lukewarmvapor. Soon they will start a long and hard fiqht tiII finally,about the 40th d.y, the Eagles begin to rob the beast and tearit up. when it dies, it infects and poisons the whole prisonwith a black poison which hurts the Eagles, and they die. Outof the putrefaction of the dead bodies a raven will be born,slowly grow after a Bath and, with a craned neck, will soonstretch its wings and begin to fly. Because of the wind andclouds it seeks out cracks and flies about for a long time. You,however, must prevent it from finding a crack. At last, when ithas become white due to slow and long-lasting rain and heavenlydew, it is transformed into a snowwhite swan. When the raven isborn, it is a sign for you that the dragon has died. To makethe raven white, extract the Elements and distill them in theorder prescribed titl they are congealed in their Earth and haveturned into a snowwhite and quite subtl-e powder. When this isdone, you will have obtained the first desire to the White.If you wish to continue to the Red, add the Element firewhich is lacking in the White work. Therefore drive the matterin such a way that the vessel be not moved and the fire be lei-surely strengthened through fine points till what is secret be-comes revealed, which will be indicated to you by the yellowcolor breaking forth.

But you must not stop challenging the fire with fireuntir you become aware that the matter will end in quite redash. This Stone vril1 elevate your mind to greater things throughthe blessing of the Holy Trinity.Those who, due to ignorance of the Art and of Nature, be-lieve that they have finished the work with the perfect Sulphur,are greatly mistaken and will attempt projection in vain. Becausethe proof of the Stone is completed with a double work, the firstbeing the production of the Sulphur and the second, the manufac-ture of the Elixir.This philosophical Sulphur is guite a subtle Earth, verywarm and dry, is whose beI1y the fire of Nature is greatly in-creased and lies hidden. That is why it is also called the fireof the Stone, because it contains the power to open and penetratethe bodies of metals and to alter their disposition, and to pro-duce its Like. It is therefore also called a father and a maleseed.So as not to pass over anything in silence, the Students ofthe philosophy should know that a second Sulphur can be made fromthe first and augmented indefinitely. When the wise philosopherhas obtained the mineral of this heavenllz ore, he must preserveit very carefully. The matter out of which the Sulphur is bornis also the matter out of which it will be augmented with theaddition of a small part of the first - but everything in theright weight. The student should learn the rest from LuLLy.

It gets its tincture and fixation from the fer-ment, its penetrating power from Sulphur, from quicksilver themeans of uniting the tincture, that is, of the ferment and ofSu1phur. But the power of augmentation, which is infused intoit, comes to it from the spirit of the Fifth Essence.Two perfect metal-s result in a perfect tincture becausethey are tinged with the pure Sulphur of Nature. This is whyno ferment of metals should be sought outside these two bodies.Therefore, tinge your white and red Elixir with SoI and Luna.Their Mercury first absorbs their tincture, and when he hasabsorbed it, he gives it to others.In preparing the Elixir, take care not to alter or intermixthe Elements. Both Elixirs require their own ferment and theirown Elements, for Nature is so constituted that the two lightshave their different Sulphurs and different tinctures.The second work is cooked in the same or a similar vessel,the same stove and the same degrees of fire as the first, but itis done in a shorter time.There are three kinds of moisture in the Stone, namely, thewatery, the airy, and the radical. Therefore, all the worker's-r 39-"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"efforts and labor must be used against this moisture. A1so,in the work of the stone no other Element than the moistureis circulated, because the Earth must first of arl be turnedinto moisture and made liouid. However, the radical moistureof all things - which is considered a fire is very tough andsticklz because it is attached to the center of Nature from whichit cannot easily be separated. Therefore, extract these moisturesvery gently' one after another, by dissolving and again congealingthem through their wheels. For by freguent and successive repe-tition of the dissolution and congelation the wheel is expandedand the whole work completed.Tha norfrrrE ys!lection of the Elixir consists in the firm conjunctionof the dry with the moist, so that they can never again be se-parated, but the dry flows into the moist with considerable heatand stays there ti1l the fire is completely suppressed.Take of the red Earth or of the red ferment three Ibs, waterand air a double l-b. Powder them finelv and make of them an amal-gamate like butter or a metallic doughr so that the Earth is soft-ened and cannot be felt when moistened. Therefore, add to it oneand a half Ibs. This has to be sufficiently digested in a tight-Iy closed or sealed vessel, with the first degree of the fire.After this, the Elements have to be extracted in order, then,with a slow motion, brought down in their Earth and congealed sothat no volatile can move. Final1y, the matter will end in ashining, red and transparent rock.

Be not afraid that it might fly away becausethe Earth, softened by the imbibing, retains and absorbs it in-side. Now the Elixir is prepared. Keep it with you and takegood care of it. Rejoice in God the Lord and keep silent.In the same way and order the White Elixir is also madeand produced, buy by using only the white El-ements. When it issuffi-ciently cooked, its body will turn into a white, shining,crystal-like leaf which wiIl become liquid when polished witha white oil. Of one of these two Elixirs throw one Ib. over10 lbs. of quicksilver well washed with wine. You will be sur-prised at its performance.Because in the El-ixir the powers of the fire of Nature areabundantly increased by the infused spirit of the Quintessence,and because the body's bad mishdps, which covered their purityand the true light of nature with darkness, are wiped out byfrequent sublimations and digestions, therefore the fiery Nature,severed from its fetters and strengthened by the aid of the hea-venly powers, is mightily effective thus locked in our fj-ve Ele-ments. It is no surprise, therefore, that no only do they havethe power to perfect the imperfect but also to increase theirown powers.The way to augment the Elixir is threefold. The first:take one Ib. of red Elixir, mix it with the pounds of its redwater, dissolve it into water in a medicinal vessel and coagulatethe well dissolved and blended matter tilI it turns into a ruby--I4I-"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"red leaf. Thereafter, wax it with its red oil - which is des-cribed above - till it flows. Thus you will get a medicinethat is ten times stronger than the first. This work is accom-plished easily and in a short time.The second method: take some of your Elixirr ds much asyou 1ike. It must be well mixed with its water, always in accor-dance with the weights. SeaI it tightly in a reduction vesseland dissolve it in a Bath with moisture. When it is dissolved,distill it by separating the Elements from their own fire and bycongealing them down, ds has been shown in the first and secondworks, tiII they turn into a Stone. Fina1ly, cover it with waxand throw it to project. This way takes longer but is much rich-â‚¬r r as the power of the Elixir is a hundred tj-mes stronger, be-cause the subtler it becomes with frequent operations, the morepower of the inferior and the superior it retains, acting allthe more vigorously.Fina1ly, take one oz. of the said Elixir which has been aug-mented in power, and throw it over one hundred of the washed Mer-cury. In a short time Mercury, heated with coal, will be trans-formed into a pure Elixir. If you wish to throw one oz. of itover one hundred similar }4ercury, the very purest gold will ap-pear before your eyes. The augmentation of the White Elixir isdone in exactly the same way.
