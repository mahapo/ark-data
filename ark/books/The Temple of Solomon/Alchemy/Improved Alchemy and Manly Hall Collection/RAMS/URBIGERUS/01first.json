The goalof the society is to seek out and obtain eopies of Alchemical manuscripts,tracts, printed works and other such materials ard literature. From these,certain items are selected for rrestorationt . This consists in re-tlping thematerial to render it readable, therefore useable. The reading is made moreenjoyable by the use of charrs, symbols, dictionaries, diagrams, insertionof printed illustrations and other annotations to shed additionat light on the text.R.A.M. S. is a non-profit organization with members from all walks oflife. There is no rorganizationt per se, just individuals desirous of perform-ing a labor of love. It is their hope that these efforts will perhaps result inrenewed interest in the science of Alchemy or even contribute to new dis-coveries or fields of experirnentation. While this material is for all on thepath of Alchemy, it is particularly for the sincere practicing Alchemist.The transcription of this material is as verbatirn as human skills permit. Theonly exceptions are to make the matter more readable, or understandable,with some rmodernizationr . This is done ONLY where it is judged that noambiguity will arise from a slight departure frcrn the original and there is nodanger of deleting key words or phrases where a possible use of Gematria,Temura, Notariqon or other form of written code exists. Thus, mis-spelled orgrarnmatically incorect material is to be found as well as archaic or strangewords. This is in an effort to maintain the original text as far as possible.The completed material is then reproduced, someti::nes bound and offered tointerested parties. The costs for these copies are useC to defray reproductioncosts and to obtain additional material for restoration.The work of R.A.M.S. includes such material as \"Last trVilI and Testament\"of Basil Valentine, important selections from the invaluable Bacstrom Manu-scripts such as ttcorden chain of Homertt, ttlamspringts Process for theLapis Sophorum\", \"The Chemistts Key\", \"The Mineral G1uten of Nitre andSulfur\", \"Coelum Philosophorum\" and others. Additionally, material by otherwritert s is or will be offered. Suchas Geber, Kalid, Ripley, Bacon, Hazelrigg, etIt is highly approrpiate to acknowledge the many persons who have either mat-erially or philosophically contributed to the present effort and future ones.

But if our dragon is forced to unite with our snakeand Iet itself be determined by the latter, such work is calledour 'dual way'. Our third wdy, and thereby the continuation of thefirst and the second, is clearly shown by Apollo with the Sun onhis head, together with Diana with the Moon, embracing each other.The rive:r' into which they descend shows the condition into whichthey must be put before they are born again and can be completelybrought into their spiritual- nature and union. The l{emaproditesignified Apollo and Diana who have begin to unite and now risefrom the river and go on land in a single body, so that Diana (bywhj-ch we understand our l{erculean labors) , having become mistressof everything, can sow on it her noble seed for the prodcution ofgood fruit, and continue the conjunction begun to (tfre state of)perfect union.Therefore, both in this figure and in the Aphorisms, theprincipal articles of faith and religion of which the Old and theNew Testament inforrn us, are put before the reader.
