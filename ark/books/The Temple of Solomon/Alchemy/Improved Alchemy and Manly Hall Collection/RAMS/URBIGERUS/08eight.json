One part, which rises, is called the unfixed; the otherpart which stays below is called the fixed part. Both parts areotherwise called earth and ferment.That is why some philosophers have said in regard to thesetwo parts that the same water is found on two mountains.And you should know that the two parts are different in theirminerals, that is, they are not rightly and well- mixed.

Forthe vol-atile part, which Geber calls angentum uiuum because ofthe likeness, cannot be hardened to such an extent that it willturn into a stone, dS it lacks a fatty substance which is a causeof hardness. Likewise the fixed part, which Geber calls sulphur,cannot be turned into a stone by any Art because it does not con-tain any moisture. The parts are therefore so loosely connectedthat a glue could be made of them without destroying or losingthe other (voIatile part).From what I have saidmoist and the dry, pertainis evident that both, that is thethe metallic nature.

This is known to afl- the wisemen in this Art, namely, that the matter at hand is not perfectedexcept solely by digestion. Now, then, nothing can be digestedwithout that which is digestible. The digestible, however,chiefly contains two parts, a moist and a dty, as Av,istotLe con-firms in his description in the ALI;r meteov..

How beautiful a philosopher has said that these twoparts, that is, the moist and the dry, are call-ed the honoredstones which originally come from one father. By name they aretwo things and yet only one in form, whereby the secret can beaccomplished naturally.

For somehave dared to produce it anew, which is impossible to do becauseit is a work of Nature, and, without the assistance of the Art,it is hardly generated by Nature alone in a thousand years.Therefore, the Art takes the same and works in it in such a wayas to accomplish and complete in one dry, that is, in a shorttime, what Nature alone can l'rarA'l rr rln in a thousand years.In the same way you may now know from the above the reasonwhy I made white go1d, ds I wrote you in my letter.
