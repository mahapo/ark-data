After that, Heformed mankind or the microcosm as man and woman from the inner-most of Earth and the other Elements, gave him the earthly para-dise as his dwelling and commanded him nothing else but to con-sider the Divine Secrets.

He orderedhim to sustain himself by multiplying the seeds which He hadplanted in it, as also to draw a quintessence out of the Elements,by means of which he would become capable of maintaining his ownElements in good equilibrium.In regard to the multiplication of the first two kingdomsand the method of extracting a quj-ntessence therefrom, there aremany who are already acquainted with it, because it is extremelynecessary for the conservation of the microcosm.-r57-"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Consequentlyr w€ will here only consider the mineral muI-tiplication which is only known to few, that is, to men of greatand deep reflection, who always apply themselves to the practS.ce,by which they differ from the uulgus medieorurn who consider thismultiplication and quintessence a pure chimera.

Therefore we have resolved to communicate ithere clearly and distinctly, without reserving the least, andwe wish that everything be accepted and explained in the liter-al sense.Accordingly, take part of our undetermined matter which isfound in the mineral realm. Through fire and water separate itfrom its terra damnata (damned earth) which stands in the way ofits birth and multiplication. This matter is put into an earth-enware retort, in small- pieces, with 3 parts of fine gold calx(oxide). When the recipient is firmly sealed and dried, it isheated by a gentle fire for one hour, during which time the phi-Iosophical earth is animated by the invisible SouI of the goId,will go over and will thus be freed of its coldness by naturalmeans.As soon as the retort has cooled, the recipient is removedand well closed. Now the above-mentioned matter is taken out ofthe retort and put into a new crucible which contains anothercrucible. For 6 consecutive hours so much of a coal fire isgiven that the matter turns glowing-red (or: red-hot). In thisway vre obtain l',ir'e granum aurL (grain of gold) or the philosophi-cal seed prepared perfectly for being sown into its earth in whichit will multipty.

After this philosophical earth has been made spi-ritual and det,ermined by the spiritualized gold-seed, it has thepower of transforming everything you wish to ferment with it intoa true multiplication seed. This is done in the following way:Take 10 parts of this earth turned into water and 1 part offine gold calx (oxide). Put it into a phial or mattress, and af-ter it is well closed, set it in horse-dung where this water willbe colored in a short while.

We haveseen a test of it made by a stranger who, after reading our aphor-isms and thereby acquiring a perfect foundation for the perfectingof the universal medicine, came to thank us for the light which wehad given him in the above-mentioned tenets.

This means that if a noble part is attacked by a spe-cial illness, its recovery can be found in the quintessence of themetal with which it corresponds and sympathizes, that is, if thisquintessence has been made potable, for example.Aside from the fact that it is a universal medicine, goldsympathizes chiefly and in particular with the heart. It streng'thens and gladdens it, and drives away all bad happenings and ob-structions that are against its natural motion.Silver sympathizes with the brain, strengthens it and drivesaway all poisonous vapors which might completely destroy it, andif it should have incurred some weakness, silver restores it to-170-"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"its previous condition.Copper sympathizes with the kidneys and the spermatic ves-sels.
