In hot climates Digestion in the Sun is also practiced.The o1d masters often digested in horse dung.

The volatile sulphureous spirit is an alcoholic essence dis-tilled from a plant.

First the Copavian(ire, Copaiva Balsam obtained from Copaiva Balsama), next to thishe recommends the \"Ita1ian\" resin, taken from the characteristicItalian pines abundantly found in the country. The pine is oftenmentioned in Italian poetry and even in music (Ottorino Respighi:'I Pini di Roma') . This resin has to be purified from its feculentparts by water. The best method of purification would be a properdistillation. Le Febure in his work \"Chymischer Handleiter\" des-cribes this process as fo11ows6:\"The resin is to be pulverized and mixed with three parts ofpulverized bricks and one part of conrmon salt which has previouslybeen completely dried by heating. The whole is then given into aretort and distilled by constantly increasing the temperature.Some of the oily distillate can be used as it is . The distillatecan also be rectified by adding once more three parts of conrmonsalt and by distilling again. \"The easiest for us is to buy readily clarified resins, suchas Copaiva Balsam (balsams are mixtures of resins and etheric oils,partly with aromatic acids) or Canada Ba1sam, the exudation of theNorth American Balsam Fir (Abies Balsamica), which is, strictlyspeaking, a turpentine. It contains about 24 percent of essentialoil, 60 percent of resin soluble in alcohol and 16 percent of resinsolubl-e in ether.

NaturalCanada Balsam is easily available, although certainly not the cheap-est resin. (Note: Prof. Junius also suggests Cedarwood Oil - HilN)If you carefully look at the copper plate you may observe thatthere is a hole in the tree, from which resins flow. In fact, theriver into which Apol1o and Diana have to step, is resinous.
