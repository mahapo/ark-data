Year 1580 Jéhove Dear brothers after our beloved ancestors, after careful consideration, have consulted with themselves on how can hide the secret that only the worthy is given, they agreed on the search a number of those who were worthy and adapted here to the mystery, who fear the presence of the Most High with all their heart, which would be silent and mouth sealed. Thus, those who would be appointed by the magic and the mystery would be born to the Kabbalah. But for a work comes to the Almighty, who knows the hearts, examine thoroughly, since all good gifts must be instilled in the human heart, this is how it happened, for a special destiny, our dear ancestors with the help of the Most High found some around the year 576 after the beginning of the world, they were descendants of Noah's race, that is to say, Japhet of these Tubal came from Shem knowledge was preserved until 100 years after the Flood, as evidenced Arphachsad. As one reached a age, while the other was instructed in the mystery. Since Arphachsad it arrived at his son Salah and wisdom remained with this strain to Abraham and Lot. Abraham to Isaac, and to Jacob, Isaac, Jacob, Joseph and Benjamin, she got them from the Egyptians, or even heard of Moses and Aaron. Under Moses and Aaron, Bazabel was filled with knowledge. This was the first imperator, but at the same time, the great Jehovah endowed not only the son Asisamat the spirit of wisdom, but many others were filled with wisdom. In the Mysterium, they wore light many miracles as Moses taught them to recognize in the center of it (the light) the fire of Nature, and taught them, as he took the calf idolater and destroyed to pieces, he poured on the fire burning prepared its metallic form making a red powder and giving it to the son of Israel who had been hit by the Lord for their sins. Similarly, he also drew a cross with a bronze serpent, and an image appears as magic. It is this image that would look at the son of Israel to abandon the pain, with the figure, they would help in their illness and yet how indescribable miracles are produced by the power of the Most High. But Mary, the sister of Moses, became reckless learned through wisdom and profaned the Lord and the Lord punished with leprosy. Then Moses took and shut him up for 7 days, a magic number. After this period, it was again pure. Moses, Aaron, Bezabel, they came to Joshua. For because of their sins, and when they had turned away from God, their wisdom was removed and given to others. Since the Almighty wants his secrets are hidden and used in the fear of Him. Joshua brings the number of priests found 12 men and 12 who were more satisfied and filled with wisdom of the Almighty, a sacred number. He ordered them as priests, full of strength and wisdom."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Thesaurus Thesaurorum 4 | P a g e They had to wear the sacred ark, but the other twelve had to stay after the Jordan was divided, the priests crossed and came to the Jordan and each half had to lift 12 stones according to the number and carry with them the Jordan, as a sign that the Lord was with them, and after the division of water from it all done, 12 stones can be prepared, for the son of knowledge, like a miracle. In this way, they follow this one (knowledge), they love it and even desire. That is why the Lord God commanded to teach and show it to the descendants. With this force CERCLA Joshua Jericho 7 times. In magic, this means a force multiplied by 7, and Jericho had to fall into ruin, as against that in mind, it could not exist. The powerful Jéhove was very moved by the fact that he had to kill Jericho. In that time, we find in our secret tradition, many, even many priests mages and sages. Because after Joshua were filled and prepared Judas and Simon. It (knowledge) long remained among the son of Israel and then she came even among the heathen, as among the first we find much. Thus they are born with magic and through them (recent) the spirit of the Most High and expresses its secret door. Joshua since she came also Gégéone. Here you can still see the collaboration of the Great Spirit of Jehovah, because it is here that the Lord showed Gedeone that would have licked his own language with water (philosophers). He chose them because they were born to magic. It is thanks to them that Gedeone defeated his enemies a figure based on the number three in the Kabbalah. Of Gedeone she came to Jephte to Sanson. At the time of Helis, the high priest, dear ancestors divided and many sages died. So Samuel became great before the Lord and was filled with the Spirit of the Lord, and many, even a large amount. Among them Saul, a man born in the Misterio became king in magic, but he is arrogant and he abandoned the Lord. After he was chosen in the Misterio, a hero well endowed, David, son of Jesse. This was reinforced in the power of the Spirit and received power throughout creation as nobody else had been before him, and he was using as the prophet Nathan. But since did not stay within the limits of the Spirit, he did not receive the orders of the priesthood of magic, as are son, Solomon, who came from the loins of its received. Born here many mages because Solomon was strong, as also in the Mystery Mysterio in his hymn he described with words limpid and clear as the first teacher and philosopher, the coarse resolution of the end, the discovery of hidden The mutation of the wet and dry metamorphosis of the fluid fixed material called by its name and thus it shows the same shape. \"I am black, pleasant enough, you daughters of Israel, you do not look at me, so I am black, as if I was sunburned.

Through this king Solomon, it (knowledge) came even among the Arabs, as he had in his hand, with his wisdom, the hearts of many people. Solomon, it came to the other priests and prophets and spread, so she came to the Romans. Solomon was the first who, with the help of Misterio, metallic images made by the influence of the stars, and brought them up, and he sinned before the Lord his God, and our childhood was selected through force God until now, as you can see in our holy tradition, so our brotherhood had to be renewed frequently, even because of it because the brothers were and still are scattered in all parts of the world . And therefore Noah was the first. From him came Shem, Ham, and it Tubal. Week, being the first-born son wrote about the emerald tablets secrecy, obtained from his father, Noah. Cham as another son of Noah, was Hermes, through which came the emerald tablet. And the Egyptians as true descendants of Ham possessed this wisdom. Cham Chus begot or young Camphes that the Egyptians called Saturn.

And Moses was learned from the Egyptians, that is how you can find even now among Egyptians. The Israelites, it came from the Arabs and Chaldeans. Since Ananios and Daniel, Meshach and Azana were the leaders of Chaldea. Daniel was master of them all. These heroes were held us together and were united by the Spirit of God until this time. Since then, prophets and dear ancestors, she managed to Allemmands us through our father Teuth. And it was kept secret from us until now so often miraculous. In this way, we have established with us this laudable habit and old order, as we have been mandated by them to maintain and pass on the secret as ecstasy or some covert operations were left in inheritance old. Since now, some brothers, as the case of human life, reach eternity, and we can not exceed the number of 77, so the Brotherhood can not exist without 77, then according to ancient custom, we selected specific places, both in the East than in the West, that is to say the 4 corners of the world, for our meetings. When you find a soul that is worthy of being accepted, having been recognized as a screening and sufficient, then such a soul must be in our meeting, and is committed as we are to accept all of the following and to promise to eternal silence, after which it will receive the sacred priesthood and become adept at magic through (concreazione). Because no real (concreazione), nobody can be a magician, because the internal and external anointing must proceed from it and so it happens: when a meeting was announced after the previous occupation of the brothers, and brothers is accepted among them a brother abroad as capable, then, if there is older, it may well give the sign to another, but it can not execute (concreazione) on him, not even submit the oath, but it may well be the silence before submitting the following, if he thinks possess. Thus, he can not reveal his conscience without offense ecstasies or covert, that way they belong to Misterio, as well as other things of knowledge and Tholio *. Since, however, in some writings here and there is some hidden things about covert operations, it must proceed carefully so that the seal is forced prematurely by one and then the other does not turn back the brotherhood and uses the gifts of God to commit injustices. When a brother in a meeting, is of a contrary opinion, we should ask him if he knows what God and even as the Spirit. It proves that moment his heart and conscience. This happens before the Urim, but it should be covered, and you will hear quickly what it says and what knowledge he has of the Most High. It was then that he will read the following: Regola ORDIAIS"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Thesaurus Thesaurorum 8 | P a g e Since the beginning, and since the Brotherhood is out (is produced) according to divine providence, the number of brothers has never been higher than 77. So many can not and should not be increased. That among us, should any problem arise due to religion or jealousy, yet each brother must leave to the recognition of his faith and the freedom of conscience, he must reserve (relying ) only to God so that there is no hatred between us. And if we believe and know that God is in three persons - Father, Son and Holy Spirit - and we fear, we love, we dedicate ourselves to Him to guide us, support us and leads us s it possesses us and dwells in us, we have the right religion. But others, who are still attached to religion and religion, can not devote himself entirely to God, because they are shared (split) and depend on the commandments, they are an abomination in the eyes of the Great Spirit, because they don ' not love God with all their heart, with all their soul and all their might. As forces such victims saintissimes, they pour on the commandments and they do not like their neighbors because they are simulators, since the Holy One in Israel wants alone heart completely and make his temple and property. So that is why since the beginning of the world have been in our association of men coming from the most diverse peoples, and (so) they should seek the Lord and they love wisdom. That is why each brother must be free, whatever his religion and not be tied to anyone and is accountable to his faith. If someone were to be pedantic, was due to carnal knowledge and ask about religion, then the brother that is addressed this issue should judge that it is not of the brotherhood, and that if a brother, he should really believe that he became religious and he no longer loves God with all his heart and it depends only as a spirit in him. But it is not a brother, there is no wonder he knows nothing of the true constitution. That after the expiry of the mandate of the King (imperator, regent of the brotherhood) another is elected. On the one as to the other, it must be subject, obedient and remain faithful to the end. As we welcomed the new acquisition, which comes (comes) of the original election. Imperator that can and should be on the list the name of each brother, as well as where they live, so that we can help another if necessary. It should be noted also, that in the election of an imperator that can and must choose one of seven older, like this from the beginning, since it is the brotherhood that was maintained at farm unwavering. That is why we do not have more than 4 houses in Europe where we hold our meetings or Ancona, Nuremberg, Hamburg and Amsterdam it lacks in esotera. By cons, if each brother imperator may, if living in such a place, to come to his brothers to hold a meeting, not a primary, but a particular. We also communicate that occur when 2 or 4 brothers, they can not elect another brother, except of course in the presence of an adult who carries with him the letters or in the presence of imperator. And if he should find one that passes for a brother, but has not received a sign of older or imperator, the brother must be careful and not be recognized, nor accept. Each apprentice must obey his lord and brother for 7 years and for the duration of his life he must remain faithful like a brother to death. Several brothers can live together during the week, so they do not speculate on their secrets, but they can do so from time to time to work on some ecstasy so they can live together. That is why we choose to prohibit a parent as a brother, even he is a brother (blood) since flesh must first recognize and approve."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Thesaurus Thesaurorum 9 | P a g e In any case, a brother must choose preferably a stranger, because art should not be inherited. Although several brothers get together, we should not let them do that without any profession or older imperator's knowledge, but they have a practice with the same exact and it is suitable for all covert operations and has a strong desire to be accepted. If, however, the brothers are together, they should do the job to anyone without the knowledge of the imperator, as we have already said. If the brothers want to do such a legacy, they must keep them after their recognition, 7 years as an apprentice, instructing them from time to time on the size of the congregation and put at your fingertips the imperator name apprentice, name, birth, country, occupation and origin, so that it can accommodate the timely concréation in our assembly and assign the sign. If the brothers are together, the usual salvation must be \"Frater Ave.\" The other answer is: \"Rosae and Aurae\" to which the first replies, \"Crucis\". And when, according to their position they recognize each other, so they must contact each other. \"Benedictus Dominus Deus Noster, which dedicates signum nobis.\" Afterwards, they show each other the seal even if they know their names, or can not exchange the seal. It should be borne in mind that, if there is fraud, which can always happen, if something about the lack of care of a brother, the seal is lost, and fell into the hands inadequate, or the brother was discovered through something else, it should behave (as) ignorant and leave the city or place in question as soon as possible. It is expressly required that the brother receives cash and Misterio after he made seven years learning, and it is accepted and received in one of our homes by the imperator and that He has vowed to silence, so he can live 60 years and can thus be applied to his work diligently. And if it finds something remarkable, it must inform the imperator, because in doing so, he is related to each brother, as it happened from the beginning, since nature is inscrutable. Brother must also promise not to insult God through the Misterium, not to damage his neighbor not to disrupt or corrupt state by this means, do not use the Misterium with bloodshed, or protect it from tyranny but the brother always says ignorant and say that it is only a fraud on the part of men. Brother should not write a book about our secret, not even against it, lest he offend the mighty God. If the brothers want to talk about Misterio, they must do so only in a well closed so that everyone could open their hearts and they can practice with each other. A brother can and must give the other stone free, since the gift of God must not be sold for money. It is forbidden to make projections to any man who has not been accepted by us, since it is the honor of the art. But beware that this can happen safely, then you must immediately abandon the place. The brothers should avoid talking foreign, especially with women. However, if this is not possible, and a brother can not live free, which would be better for him, he can take a wife and bind it with the fear of the Lord. He should also avoid all the scandals against Misterio and leave no brother, if he is young, alone with his wife to practice with him so he does in the following, as it has repeatedly been , disorder and adultery.

It should also not use the stone with a strong excitation, so that the light of nature turns more, there would be a sudden death as it has already happened to some who have used it for hunting. It is also against Misterio asking for graces and who already have everything. It is also necessary to keep precious stones or beads and wear them with you. 11 is forbidden to betray someone in our house and also confess to someone about the matter of our blessed stone and reveal the manipulation, coagulation or solution Misterio. Because sometimes, in a place he is one of our brothers t as they are almost always hidden on the day of the first feast of Pentecost, to the sunrise, they must leave the door to such a place, s' he is lord of the Cross Aurea, it should set a red cross on the stick, he is lord of the cross of the rose cross green and must remain there until sunrise and stay alert, if perhaps another brother arrives to meet with the usual hi and to inform the imperator. Because in time of war, when everything is uncertain and no brother can enter and exit, this is very necessary. We believe that the necessary changes imperator place every 10 years and to share during a meeting in which the brothers should give it another name so that the Brotherhood remains hidden. It is also an express command that each brother after he was accepted among us, it changed its name. It must also, if he goes back to a place where it has been for a long time before, change its image with the stone so that it does not recognize it. Each brother should stay away from his country for more than 10 years, regardless of where he travels, and whatever the name it bears is {) must always inform the imperator. Similarly, no brother should start work in a place without there having previously lived for a year and he knows his surroundings, and he must also escape all \"professores ignorant\" (in Latin in the text ). A brother should not reveal his wealth to anyone and must protect especially to all religious since they are known as high priests the devil in the heart. With the words of the Most High they hide their trick. This is why a brother should shun them, because there is rarely good to expect from them, they willingly claim the esteem of the person before all men. Thus in 1641, in Austria, we lost two of our brothers because of their warm and open attitude. If a brother wants to work, he must be helped by people more willing and able than older youth, to the extent possible, they should not get to see the operation and do not understand.

And if he should go back to that place, then it can write to the owner of the house that he leaves behind business are distributed to the poor. It is necessary and if the best brother carries with him the stone powder or crystals squarely, since oily form, it is not easy to take. No brother should not carry with it something of our philosopher's fire which could easily happen a great misfortune. Similarly, a brother should, when he would thoughtlessly entangled in a mishap and be discovered by a sovereign to kill himself rather than to reveal the Misterio, since God alone is given to reveal the Misterio, but not us , men, and if the brother remains faithful to the Supreme God, he can have more certainty to be honored before the throne of the Lamb. Here he is asked if he wants to keep inviolable brother points if he has read and understood all. If he testifies yes, you must give the sign of peace, that is to say, a bit of palm, then the new brother must kneel and one of those must embrace three times and say, \"Dear brother, we will ordain silence \". When this happens, the imperator in his priestly clothing goes to him accompanied by two elderly who take their midst the brother again. At this time the brother must raise the right hand to the body Urim, raise your thumb and first two fingers, place the left hand on heart and say that: \"I, MM promise eternal and living God no not disclose to any person without the permission of the following present and all Misteria secret that I have been taught and learned by me will you, but keep it sealed me for life with the natural seal, not to reveal the smallest thing any brother, even after the name, or imperator not show anyone the stone.

Then collected in glass containers your urine between thirty and forty jars. Put it in the sun in tightly closed containers in glass or stone, let them rest for three months or more. But in any case you must not let in the rain. Then you take your urine, put a little in a large retort, laying in a sand bath a large closed container harvest. Firstly, among the thousand colors distills the Spiritus Mercurialis Microcosmi. When all the colors its parts, remove the container, poured another glass spiritus pure and hand the container again and distilled over half of phlegm spiritual. It also guards you alone. Liquor and remained, until you let smoke density similar to honey. So do it with all the remaining urine, so you leave your first smoke Spiritus Mercurialis volatilis, then your phlegm volatile, then the rest of the smelly phlegm up juice (juice) and brown regular (consistent). Then you pour all the juice thus obtained in a large retort earth, put it in an oven where you can give per gradus fire and distills everything and at the end gives a sustained fire, so that the vinegar also rises the surface, and do not worry that your material in a founded earthen retort because it is too worldly. Separated in the same way liquor sought, take the \"caput mortum\" of the retort and restrict this little, put it in a flask and poured over all your phlegm volatile, and put the flask to putrefy for four weeks in a moderate heat. Then distilled spiritus your volatilis from a flask equipped with a condenser ample. Since this spiritus settles largely around four or five corrections as a white salt and moves readily (easily) the capacitor, it should be ample.

Then take your caput mortum rotten and filter it to make it become clean and pure it becomes clear manifesto. Put this clear solution in a retort and distilled until it is! obtained all the phlegm carefully in the sand. After that, you take the salt, put it in a flask and pour over the azoth and the spiritus and part of phlegm spiritual, that is to say as much phlegm as spiritus. NB there are others here who distill from the first extract and salt phlegm he left behind in the retort as the latter, then they add much spiritus. Then they add yet azoth and the digest with each other in a retort closed and they grind for four days and four nights and they arise in a cold place and crystals take shape.

And continue this until nothing crystallizes. Then they put together all the crystals in a glass and they dry slowly, the same way they extract the phlegm. By cons, some crystals in the extract distilled phlegm phlegm as it takes so that they are barely dissoudrent and they put glass in a moderate heat. And the solution comes quickly, then they let the solution cool, pour it into a clean glass and raised in a cold place. In this way it forms crystals much more beautiful than the previous. They leave them and they repeat the same thing in the same way until the crystals are pure and clear. Because at the time to dissolve and crystallize, they attach themselves completely and are imbued with the spiritual phlegm. These crystals they take half and enclose in a jar and set after grinding in pure gold, with the remaining crystals, they increase the work. 2. But others against, contain crystals and posed in a steam bath and there they dissoudrent by themselves, then they distill liquor through cohobation. They pour the liquor on the Mercurius vivus and they also exude cohoband until the liquid carries with it much of it has mercurius vivus weighed itself. With this liquor Alkahest, they come in gold and better way to end. 3. You also need to take the crystals mentioned above and put them in a retort and put the retort in a sand bath and extract a Spiritus (water spirits (spirit alediol?) And then shake again the eau-de-vie in the event that the retort is still complete and cohobe. Distills it again from there. Repeat this often until the crystals are mounted with the liquor. then pour it on mercurius vivus learned and proceeds as above. But this is a long and difficult: the following is the best. 4. Take your crystals and weighs them after they become dry in a flask: an ounce of pulverized Mercurius vivus purified until it all together is becoming a mass, then put it in a flask very high and poses flask in a sand bath, put him over a capacitor and give him to sublimate A fire and keep it for as long as necessary until everything is mounted. After that remove the capacitor and gathered all the sublimate. Which remained in the flask (caput), crushes it with the sublimated and paid for it again as it had been distilled.

Repeat this several times, until all sublime with the exception of some slag. All of this sublime twice (self) always collects and what goes into drops, since you will use them. Here you have two paths in front of you then: the dry and the wet. 5. If you want to take the dry do so like this: take your salt miraculous hermaphroditique sublimated, 12 loth (6 ounces) and grind in one loth of gold (half ounce) finely beaten, put it in a jar, put this sealed vial in our furnace, so they will mix through various colors."},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"Thesaurus Thesaurorum 25 | P a g e When all the colors are gone, your spells lapis, axes and grind it finely-2 are also loth (1 ounce) of your miraculous salt.

The wet is not so dangerous, so do: take your sublimated, shredding the end, put it in a glass bowl, put it in the cellar which is moist and make sure that nothing falls in, and in a short time, it will decompose in liqueur.

If necessary, in the BM-déflegmes this way the famous Alkahest is ready for the special quality. With this, you can gently break the gold and make into dye through the colors. And this is the way very secret and hidden and it is exactly what you need go as it was explained before liquor. Praised and glorified be the Great God who has made us worthy of this great secret. You can arrive at work as the following: gold, as it was taught above, when you set the spiritus and azoth phlegm and spiritual, as well as the salt must be completely dry, then weighs in finely-axes and one book. Now, I want to reveal something wonderful. Take magnesia or bismuth, if you do not have bismuth, although it is better to take pirargirite a book also, the finely-ax, blot it with salt and let them melt together in a good stove [a good crucible]. Then remove the pan [the pot] and remove the substance (salt pan) after it has cooled, it grinds finely, put it in a flask and put it on medium heat for 4 days 4 nights and putrefaction. Then take the flask, let cool and filter the clear solution into another flask, still pays a portion of the substance distilled phlegm and repeat all the work until all the salt is extracted. Verse solutions together fine, clear and bright (hot or filtered) in a flask, put it in the sand, put a lid (cap) and fixed a collector and distilled everything from salt until dry. Then poured yet phlegm on salt and extract it again and it will settle a few feces. Pays back all clear extractions in a flask or in a retort, and distil-in all the phlegm up to a thick juice. Then poured over water spirits and azoth above ground, digested (assimilated) well connected 4 days and 4 nights and then lay it in a cold and leaves until the crystals form. By doing so you have to look in the direction parallel to the same thing, as it has been said before, only that these crystals will crystallize in many colors. They are much better than the previous and after they are replaced with gold and with one another passed through the colors, you get a perfect lapidem medicinalem. Completion in substance, this spread (widened) enormously. But regarding Opus maximum, throughout the same work, only that there are two parts: some take only the urine and feces and rot are with each other , others take even more hair.

But do not move the glass otherwise it will vanish but leave her alone, so she returned to the light. Moreover, in the Spirit World magnesia (spiritus Mundi) is already determined, that is to say, it is metallic in vero seu principium metallorum over safely and is lunar in all its parts as when it comes to light, the gray stone is not expensive and it is outdoors and when it has first a fixed grain (Granum Fixum Ms Darmstadt), it becomes rather silver (sic!) this also shows the blue happens with it is that it is truly Color of Money (Lunae), and even this material if it is first calcined and hardened a little (SSS) with the moon gives a good test.

Then poured together all extractions in a flask, distilling some phlegm and put the rest in pantry, and will form crystals and you get a green grass Vitriol, which the ancients called the green lion or dragon. This is the true sages Vitriol, salt green growing Vitriolum Philosophorum. Dry it a little salt, grind it finely, mix a red earth in fat (Bolus armenicus Ms Darmstadt) to do this small balls, dry them and filled it with a retort, since it distills vulgari speaking a spiritus, you have to pay back again and for at least three times, Caput Mortum extract, then it divides the phlegm. But it is better if after you extract the spiritus, you take the Caput Mortum, you extract it from there all the salt you pour over the spiritus mounted and since cohobation you distil several times spiritus. However, the above (named above) is not disposable. Then separates all this phlegm, until at the bottom settles a beautiful green oil. This oil makes phlegm with spiritus, or better: the first distilled spiritus phlegm, pour it on the liquor and extract it obtained it a few times until the oil becomes thick as your oil fluid rosin, and you have the chaos of the ancients. After this put the rosin in a carafe, seal it tightly and puts it in a moderate heat rotting. In this way the matter will be resolved in a spiritus lens and a red-brown earth. This is the spiritus Mercurius philosophorum or Columba Dianae. Rectifies it a few times, so that all of this comes phlegm with phlegm extract from the brown earth and sulfur after calcining the residue, dissolved as salt fixus.

Then take 2 lots of these crystals and 3 lots of sulfur, grind them well in a glass mortar, put them in a good solid jar, seal it and put it in our secret furnace (oven graduation) they are very volatile and penetrating, leave them in a moderate heat, so they dissolve in water because the salt thins easily.

Its preparation is indeed a way boring, however wonderful and inexpensive. Much time is requested by putrefaction; moreover, the work is neither difficult nor dangerous.

When put into the fire, his mercury can not be separated because this material is very difficult to fuse, so everything smokes him. This material is a good magnet (Magnete) for Universal Spiritus because she is very hungry (greedy) and if such spiritus was extracted in a quantum self and this is corrected, you can produce actum in his own body the way it was worked by the dear ancestors who obtained a Salt him. But since in Magnesia and Bismuth, there is a way closer (nd: simple) and such material is recognized as being more clear and not as (so) hidden, so we chose him as the Bismuth Spiritus Mundi is content in larger amounts, among other things, it also contains a good mercury and a beautiful salt that can be extracted through his own mind and represented in the form of salt (crystallized) as philosophers, as has already been said called salt their vitriol.

The time he has before his eyes the Most High and he dropped the love for man and the creature, it goes with the eternal spirit to nature center.

That is why, apart from God, it is no longer needed to fear with all your heart, all your soul and with all your strength. This was the first commandment God as the Lord gave to the first man and he raises this command every man and he does not tolerate subordination as one who fears the Lord will be preserved. By the way, you can just become a mage and a scientist and learn to understand how comic (designed) the nature together with its characteristics.

Since seeing God face to face in all its force is impossible, as you see in Moses.

If you're so forth, just so you can see into the heart of nature and the center of all things will be made manifest, that you can speak with all creatures of nature and all must obey. As similar to the children of this world creatures stir the kingdom of darkness through their false imagination and they are invalidated by the spirit of darkness, and in their own way and they make great miracles and they have such power that they moving parts and can even cause damage to all creatures. Similarly, they go through the closed doors, through the air, with or without a body, they also produce promoting the power of darkness, young devils and other terrible things. But a man who is the Almighty with all his strength should be no miracles? It is certainly impossible, since God favors his own and gives them what their heart desires. All nature should serve as a man and be ready to do the same. Similarly, all the angels and all the helpful spirits are ready to serve you, as we have shown and taught extensively in our writings, is that so cabalistic magic. 'm Only our teaching and be quiet and you foreshadow an eternal Silentium. QUID SIT MAGIA Magic is the art and the faculty by which to attain knowledge of the elements of body and fruit qualities and powers and covert operations. However, the same cabal built using the analogy, one way to God and teaches how to live with Him and do His only through prophecies. Because the cabal is full of divine mysteries, while Arcane magic is full of natural teaching to pronounce these prophecies of future events and presentiments from nature. Its action is in all creatures, so that the heavenly bodies and earthly recognize what is hidden in their interior that hides the powers and virtues which \"are intended from the beginning and what qualities they have. This and things like that can recognize how the heavenly land is linked to the order that includes a good time either with the eyes or with the soul through its operations. Such a junction or celestial influences such mark by which act the divine powers in the lower body once was called the wise men and sages \"union Gamaheum\" (sic!). That is to say that the stars above meet excellently the stars below as the sun and the planets with plants, minerals and animals. However, the devil tries to date by extraordinary efforts and all his strength to obscure his way to the light (intended) nature. Magic originates from the ternary divine trinity from God. Since God distinguishes all creatures with this Ternary and prints them in the hieroglyphic sign with his finger so that nothing can be attributed to the nature of things which is devoid of this gift of divine ternary and that clearly demonstrates. The creature teaches us to understand and see the Creator. This"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"Thesaurus Thesaurorum 71 | P a g e union of the divine ternary spreads throughout the substance of things is indissoluble and that is why we also Arcanum of any nature for the 4 elements. So the ternary product with quaternary perfect septenary with many of Arcane and which are revealed to us. And given that the quaténaire lies in the ternary light appears on the horizon and in turn makes us recognize the full link with God. Far as accessing the powers and operations of all creatures and their obvious use through archaic signs, symbols and images, so that it remains almost any point that can not be discovered through exploration. And where a ternary and quaternary rise to a décanaire (= 10) for their unit, regression is done. Arcane is hidden in all this occult knowledge of the things of God with His words and then with the multitude of His creatures he made a post for the men of good will to have the true knowledge of Him. This way means Kabbalah. She is hearing, that is to say that science has never been given to books, however, the dying father whispered to his son with the science, Moses brought forth water from the rock , divided into two sea with it Gideon fought his enemies. The faith of the Hebrews was therefore natural, it has never been acquired by one through miracles are supernatural things, but they had faith with the cabalistic Arcane purely natural. If the Jews, who were in the shade and the riddle had this cabal, we too can have that are in the law of grace, who have the grain, while the Hebrews had only twig and the ball. Also read \"De Occulta Philosophia\" Basilius Valentinus in and you will find little that is nothing other than golden words. This is why art is a cabalistic science is very occult and through it, as they say, has been passed with the divine law of Moses which was revealed with the doctrine of God the Messiah. He who, having made a contract with the angels his followers to bring us to the cognition of all things natural and divine light illuminates with the darkness. The way is Hebrew is said to have been received in Latin, and Moses received on Mount with the law that was passed later to the people as very secret and true explanation of the law (that is, say the Qabalah) and it was forbidden to write, but in the order of his successors, one received another revelation almost like a secret order, so that the divine mysteries might not be recognized and dishonor and violated by the profane mass. The Persians were the most diligent of it and they called the Magi who came from the east to worship Christ. It is likely that the old Rabius recognized, through one of the Qabalah science trinity of God and Christ as the son of God. That is why this science is safe and heavenly and has its origin in the sacred writings. But disgraced Hebrew faith in the doctrine and therefore faith in this science. This is the Kabbalah.

In this finishing stones almost nothing is lost or magic must come from the rest of the first or second rotation, so it should not be exalted in particular. In addition, be careful that the stones are completely covered by the dye fluid. Similarly we do give gemstones white, green and blue with the white dye in liquid rendered water bath. One that carries with it such a stone is protected from many negative impulses.

They ensure the preparation of these stones against the darkness, to bring in the right way the course of those operating well so that they reach the holy and blessed land out of the dark solitude. This is why I dare to explain to those who know my modesty has long been supporting the occupation with the work being infused with the grace of God which is the only door in Him these things in a miraculous way and nobody other. Hear now the words of Aristotle, who says: \"Then take the stone animal, vegetable and mineral.\" There were many who believed that these words indicated three stones or three different things. Me, however, I say that there is a only thing that is mineral, vegetable and animal, and I say more, this stone is almost similar to things mineral is repeated any time and from any origin, it is convertible into any color as it contains all the elements and said everybody minor and contains all active and passive virtues rests on all mineral stones of the mountain.

It should however be transformed into clear water because water alone possesses the philosopher's treasure and through it, it becomes solid. For this reason, everything has a love and desire to those things which are most related. This thing, however, not to linger too, is nothing other than mercury, but not vulgar, rather embryonic, that is to say, a Mercury whose nature began its first function: they call l'Eau Vive Philosopher. Its vapor is essential that mercury and sulfur prepared live pure, put together by nature otherwise the water can not bear his name metallic. While mercury vulgar, a dead body has no mind, however, sulfur and coarse ground, although it can be sharpened (emaciated) using natural salt and pure sulfur. The subject of this mercury is a substance embryonic metallic mercury kinship created in metallic veins through sulfur fuel required is needed primarily for the creation of a metal, but dictum fuel prevented sulfur (sic!) it comes from the tree compared (similar) from the root to the top one and only mercury, the source of all metals. This mercury is extracted with water and with it we complete the work of any finesse (control). With regard to all her friends, she is the only all metal material, which is why mercury is a seed born of the sun and the moon linked with sulfur sun so that it can no longer be separated even by Art. For this reason, his father is the sun, its mother, cons, moon.

The ancient sages of the world have left many written poetry which is hidden in the great universal work, such as fables and stories of Mars and Venus, Aries and Taurus, the creation of people Kling, fiery dragon, the lions of Jason and Medea and feet prepared, and countless other stories.

However, this dirt is accidental and therefore separable. Sublimation of the mercury ends of Two ways: by the stirring unnecessary and introducing what is missing.

Reverse the separated and cohobe long as it is a fixed oil and can not be separated not anything good. 13. Let digest for another month and fixed it by distillation as it does not separate layer through the secret salt. You do not repent of this long work and do not get discouraged, because in this work is the third part of all the hidden secrets of (in) all minerals and metals without which we fail to do anything productive , healthy and perfect. Theophrastus has left to the reader hungry for art because it sufficient to consider what is actually Circulatum minus, which is the mixed water. However, that reads Circulatum Minus in the first part, he discovers this secret and easily find that Cautsmann was really in possession of the true Arcanum, as it is written here, it does not contain incorrect word and a gentleman came into possession Cautsmann a heritage that only Arcanum but in our book is one of the smallest. In this work all depends on the right handling, and do not doubt its fulfillment happy. So these are our main operations and travails noble you must know to strength and our teachers have collected with great care and commitment indescribable although we know, other universal but as those that are not well described here and in which all individuals are too, and that has a particularly useful, it is not far from universal.

The main art consists in the preparation of oil Vtriol per se or by dissolving the art taught in the Arcanum of vitriol (Arcanun Vitrioli), making him rush Speanter park zinc or crushed so that the whole earth settles to the bottom. We need to dissolve vitrioli in sufficient water, filter it in special paper (paper = Flusspapier merger or gray paper per cartam NT), put it in a pan and add iron or zinc granules Speanter. Boiled together for about an hour or half-hour alone, it deposits on the bottom while the green is not nothing else that copper and iron and zinc and sticks to Speanter after filtered through paper and it will clear shape, then it should coagulate and distillation will separate easily and 1'huile Etching as well as in time of one hour can be distilled 1 pound whole Vitriol oil with the aid of 10 pounds of coal. This oil is very mineral, it is better for all common operations materialists, especially if it is corrected. It should melt the zinc or Speanler and then put hot into cold water through a brush (sic) how you want. After pouring vitriol water, rinse zinc or Speanter with hot water only and wipe, it is always ready for later use. We must rectify this oil of vitriol in a retort, the receiver must be large and closed"}]
