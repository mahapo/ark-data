In December 1 603 there was a conjunction of Saturn and Jupiter, the hour-hands of the cosmic clock which usher in new epochs and crumble old orders. New stars suddenly appeared the next year in the constellation s of the Serpent and the Swan, and fears and hopes were rife throughout Europe. In England, the long reign of the Tudors came to an end, and from the barbarous North rode James Stuart, a weird king who loved learning and lechery, and hated witches and weapons. Britain's Renaissance, if one can so call it, had reached its zenith, and the time of 'Renaissance men' was all but past. Robert Fludd was such a man. He lived at the very end of the era in which it was possible for one mind to encompass the whole of learn-ing. His was one of the last attempts to do so, and he betrays something approaching despair in his endlessly elaborated plans for a magnum opus that was never finished. His goal was nothing less than to summarize the knowledge of both the universe and man - of macrocosm and micro-cosm - and the relations between them. How different his vision must have been from the common one of our own time ; in place of an infinite material cosmos expanding in all directions beyond hope of description, he could envisage one that passed through a few well-defined regions and then terminated in the utter simplex of God. This unified vision was sundered in his own life-time by Descartes, who laid the foundation for a philosophical separation of matter from intelligence which still holds the race in thrall, thanks to the amazing results that experimental science has wrought in the physical world. Only now, in the last quarter of our ccntury, the knowledge won through the Scientific Revolution is ready to be incorporated into a new system that again takes account of metaphysical realities. The spiral of human development is leading many people back to a world-view not so very different from Fludd's, yet (as is the way with spirals) a little more advanced. The magic of these pictures is that they remind us of the possibility, indeed the imminence, of a cosmic view free alike from the myopia of materialism and the absurdities of naive spiritualism. Fludd was born and bred an Elizabethan. His father was Sir Thomas Fludd, the younger son of a Shropshire family who had made his own way through a career of military administration, rising from the humble post of victualler for the Berwick-on-Tweed garrison to that of Treasurer for Her Majesty's forces in the Netherlands. For his services he received a knighthood, and retired to his home in Kent Milgate House, Bearsted, which though largely rebuilt in the eighteenth century still retains part of the sixteenth-ccntury building. Here Sir Thomas lived until his death in 1607, acting as Justice of the Peace, respected and esteemed by all. So much we learn from the commemorative plaque placed by Robert in Bearsted Parish Church, which also records the marriages of Sir Tho-mas's other children to knights and gentlefolk. One cannot help wonder-ing what this tough and successful man of the world thought of the career and interests of Robert himself, of whom Paul Arnold says in his Histoire that 'his impetuous character and his thirst for knowledge far removed him from the peaceable life of a gentleman farmer'. Our knowledge of Robert is a blank from his birth in 1 574 until 1 592, when he entered St John's College, Oxford: a citadel of High Church allegiance in a university that was generally Calvimstic in leanings. There 5"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"he would have known William Laud, later Archbishop of Canterbury, and Sir William Paddy, later physician to James I and a lifelong friend of both Laud and Fludd. Both were concerned for the restoration of music to its proper place in the Anglican liturgy, and Paddy later pre-sented his college with an organ as well as with copies of some of Fludd'sworks. Otherswhomaywell have influenced Fludd as an under-graduate were Dr John Rainoldes, President of Corpus and an expert in Hebrew and rabbinical studies, and Thomas Allen, mathematician of Trinity and a collector of medieval manuscripts. By the time he graduated Bachelor of Arts in 1596, Fludd was sufficiently versed in music to com-pose his treatise on the subject, and had become expert in mundane and horary astrology. He tells one of his few anecdotes in this con-nection : While I was working on my music treatise, I scarcely left my room for a week on end. One Tuesday a young man from Magdalen came to see me, and dined in my room. The following Sunday I was invited to dine with a friend from the town, and while dressing for the occasion I could not find my valuable sword-belt and scabbard, worth ten French gold pieces. I asked everyone in college if they knew any-thing about it, but with no success I therefore drew up a horary chart for the moment at which I had noticed the loss, and deduced from the position of Mercury and other features that the thief was a talkative youth situated in the East, while the stolen goods must now be in the South. On thinking this over I remembered my guest of Tuesday, whose college lay directly to the east of St John's. I sent my servant to approach him politely, but he swore that he had touched nothing of mine. Next I sent my servant to speak to the boy who had accom-panied my visitor on that day, and with harsh words and threats he made him confess that he had stolen the goods and taken them 10 a place I knew near Christ Church where people listened to music and consorted with women. This confirmed my conjecture that the place was to the south of St John's, and since Mercury had been in the house of Venus, that accorded with the association with music and women. After this the boy was taken into the presence of his companion and flung to the ground. He swore that he had indeed committed the crime, and begged my servant to say no more: he promised to retrieve the belt and scabbard on the following day This was done, and I received my stolen property wrapped in two beautiful parchments. It emerged that the music-house near Christ Church was the lair of a receiver of stolen goods who had robbed many degenerate scholars, wasting them with gluttony and womanizing. My friend implored me to desist from the study of astrology, saying that I could not have solved this crime without demonic aid. I thanked him for his advice. (UCH I, b, pp. 701-3) Priding himself on having always remained an 'unstained virgin', Fludd had little sympathy for the frailties of the flesh, and sexual desire figured in his philosophy as the very cause of man's Fall. He remained at Oxford until after his Master of Arts degree in 1598, then left England for the Continent where he travelled for nearly six years in France, Spain, Italy and Germany, supported by his father and working as a \\utor m anstocvaùc famiUcs. He names some of h\\s pupils as Charles de Lorraine, fourth Duc de Guise, and his brother Francois; the Marquis de Orizon, Vicomte de Cadenet, and one Reinaud of Avignon. It was"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"in Avignon that he was delayed during the winter ol 1601 2 while hop ing to cross the Alps into Italy, and tangled with the Jesuits on the subject of geomancy. a system of divination from the patterns of thrown pebbles. They disapproved of the science and tried to discredit him with the Papal Vice-Legate But that gentleman turned out to be an even better geomancer than Fludd himself, and the wandering scholar made a new and influential friend. He said that he was sorry to have to leave Avignon for Marseilles, where he was to tutor the Guises Our informa-tion on his further travels is very slim. He was certainly in Leghorn and Rome, where he met one 'Grutherus', a Swiss in the employ of Cardinal Sextus Giorgio who taught him engineering and the use of the weapon salve and other 'magnetic' medicines. This would have been before his sojourn in Avignon, where he compiled his knowledge of engineering into a treatise for Reinaud. He must have returned to Italy, for in 1602 he met William Harvey in Padua. It seems fair to assume that Fludd's vocation as a physician formed itself during these years of roaming, and that his leanings towards the occult, already evident in his hobby of astrology, led him into Paracelsian medical circles on the Continent. Paracelsus's 'chemical' medicine com-pared with the prevailing Galenic medicine much as homoeopathy does nowadays with allopathy, and its practitioners were looked upon askance by the established physicians Traditional medicine, still based largely on the balancing of the four humours (choleric, sanguine, phleg-matic and melancholic), had made little progress since the time of Galen himself (second century AD), and had not taken advantage of the disco-veries which had been made as by products of alchemy Paracelsus, like present day practitioners of fringe medicine, was against surgery and in favour of treating like with like • a principle accepted in vaccination and the very basis of homoeopathy. His was a holistic healing system that treated the patient first and the disease second, thus he considered not just the physical body but the subtler ones as well, and said that a doctor ignorant of astrology is nothing better than a quack Here, too, his ideas are returning m the treatment of the subtle bodies through radionics and the respect paid to astrology by such as C G. Jung, who always read his patients' horoscopes. On his return to England, Fludd entered Christ Church, Oxford, and by May 1 605 was able to pass his Bachelor and Doctorate of Medicine. But his allegiance to Paracelsian principles soon led him into difficulties with the medical establishment. He failed his first examination by the College of Physicians and was not allowed to practise. In February 1606 he was examined a second time, and according to the College's records, 'Although he did not give full satisfaction in the examinations, he was thought not unlearned and therefore allowed to practise medicine ' By May, he was exhibiting all the zeal of a recent convert, 'prating about himself and his chemical medicines and heaping contempt on the Galenic doctors'; his name was removed from the roll and he was told to behave himself better. So in 1607 he had to appty again, was thrice examined, and re-admitted as a candidate in December In March 1608. he again 'conducted himself so insolently as to offend everyone', and was once more reiected. Not until September 1609 was he finally admitted a Fellow in good standing One feels a little sorry for his father, who died in the midst of these embarrassing proceedings The years after Fludd's return to England were also spent assembling his assorted treatises and teaching notes into what was to become his major work, the History of the Macrocosm and the Microcosm {Utriusque Cosmi. . Historia) More of an encyclopedia than a history 7"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"in the modern sense, this massive work was intended to cover in its first volume the macrocosm-what we would call the external world-in two divisions: God's works, and man's. God's works are the creation and sustenance of the universe and all its inhabitants; man's are the arts and sciences, which for Fludd included things as disparate as music and fortification, astrology and perspective-drawing. The second volume was devoted to man himself, the microcosm, and included both man's God-given faculties (such as prophecy, knowledge of higher worlds, and the physical body itself ) and his own inventions which lead to self-knowledge (palmistry, geomancy, horoscopy, etc.). The only major fields of Renaissance learning which Fludd never touchcd upon were con-troversial theology and classical philology. As a broad-minded man who was proud that his writings were acceptable to Calvinists, Anglicans and Catholics alike, he had no time for the issues that divided them. As for Greek and Latin literature, he seems to have been interested only in the philosophical works, and of those he knew the Greek ones (the Corpus Hermeticum, Plato and the Neoplatonists) only in Ficino's Latin translations. Otherwise, the whole world was his concern, and he could discuss the practicalities of engineering as authoritatively as the mys-teries which were closer to his heart. A tremendous enthusiasm and a voracious appetite for detailed knowledge mark all Fludd's encyclopedic works, and he evidently wrote fast He assures us that he had completed the macrocosmic volume four or five years before he first heard of the Rosicrucians, that is, by 1612 at the very latest. We con date some of the treatises more precisely with the help of the introduction to the second part of this volume He says that he prepared the one on arithmetic for Charles, Duc de Guise, and those on geometry, perspective and military science for his brother François. Those on music and the art of memory were written for the Marquis de Orizon. The book on cosmography was dedicated to Fludd's father, to help him in his observations abroad, and the one on geomancy to the Papal Vice-Legate mentioned above. Finally, the astrological and engineering treatises were prepared for Reinaud of Avignon This dates them all, in substance if not in their final form, before 1604, making a most impressive achievement for a man of thirty. Fludd set up his medical practice in London, living first in Fenchurch Street and later in Coleman Street. He was successful enough to employ his own apothecary-doubtless a necessity for a Paracelsian physician whose herbal and chemical remedies were not compounded by every pharmacist. His early biographers, misunderstanding his medical ideas, attributed his success merely to his bedside manner: Thomas Fuller wrote that 'seeing conceit is very contributive to the well working of physic, [the patients'] fancy or faith natural was much advanced by his elevated expressions', and Anthony à Wood that 'he spoke to his patients amusing them with I know not what, till by his elevated expressions he operated them into a faith-natural, which consequently contributed to the well working of the physic' Obviously he was something of a psychic healer. Among his patients he could count John Selden, the eminent lawyer and antiquary, and among his close friends William Har-vey, who discovered the circulation of the blood. Once his initial sparring with the College of Physicians was over, his standing improved to the point of his serving frequently as their Censor (examiner). Much of his medical approach can be deduced from his own treatises, notably the several parts of Medicina Catholica. He used several tech-niques of diagnosis, including the time honoured methods of feeling the patients' pulses and examining their urine, to both of which he gave"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"a thorough if idiosyncratic philosophical grounding. He diagnosed, too, through his patients' horoscopes and calculated their critical days from planetary transits. But unfortunately he wrote little of treatment: a few recipes and rules of life, and a great many prayers, are all the sufferer will find in his books. One exception is the weapon-salve, an ointment with which one anoints not the wound but the article that caused it. This generated a lively controversy after Fludd published the recipe in Anatom/ae Amphitheatrum, thereby annoying an obscure parish priest, William Foster, who attacked it with his Sponge to Wipe Away the Weapon-Saive. And this was not the only magnetic' remedy in Fludd's medicine-bag. The mysterious Scottish doctor William Maxwell was apparently close enough to Fludd to learn some of his darker secrets: When I was visiting Dr Robert Fludd last year with my friend Stafford, and we came to discuss these things, Dr Fludd spoke, as was his wont, very sagaciously but also secretively about this art [of magnetic healing]. Among other things he was able to tell me of the wonders of a magnet which I had heard of but never myself tried it had such power of attraction that when he applied it to his heart it drew him with such force that he could not have held out for long. The Fluddian magnet is nothing other than dessicated human flesh, which certainly possesses the greatest attractive power ; it should be taken, if possible, from a body still warm, and from a man who has died a violent death. (Quoted in Peuckert, Gaba/ia, p. 271) It is hard to visualize the gentle doctor lurking at Tyburn, scalpel in hand, waiting to acquire the material for a new magnet. Among the other prominent figures of the early seventeenth century with whom Fludd has been associated, strong circumstantial evidence supports the conjectures that he knew Inigo Jones (see Yates, Theatre of the World) and Thomas Campion (see Barton). This brought him, through his interest in machinery and music, into the circle of masque-makers who flourished in the early Stuart court Many of the machines and fountains in his engineering treatise are designed for frivolous or entertaining purposes, like the 'wooden ox that lowed and moved, and a dragon that moved, hissed and spat flames at the ox' which he claims in Tractatus Apo/ogeticus to have constructed himself. When in addition he tells us that his mechanical musical instruments were well received by the royal musicians, it seems more than likely that his multifarious talents were called upon by the producers of the masques in designing their stage effects. Was it through this channel or through Sir William Paddy, the Royal Physician, that he gained the ear of the King himself, to whom he dedicated his first major work? It seems that this, the first part of the History of the Macrocosm, created something of a stir on its appearance in 1617. James had accepted the fulsome dedication, which addressed him with the Her-metic epithet Ter maximus ('thrice greatest'), but some of those sur-rounding the paranoid king may have whispered rumours of witchcraft when they saw the work with its mysterious illustrations. Fludd was summoned by James to reply to his calumniators, and said in his reply to Foster that he 'received from that time forward many gracious favours of him, and found him my just and kingly patron all the days of his life'. (James died in 1625.) Two manuscripts addressed to the King between 1617 and 1 620, entitled Dec/aratio Brevis and A Philosophical/ Key, also show Fludd in a defensive position, supporting his views with letters from sympathetic foreign scholars. 9"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Fludd first entered print, however, not with his long-hatched History but with three small books occasioned by the Rosicrucian manifestoes. These anonymous publications, which kindled such emotions of sym-pathy and antipathy, were the Fama Fraternitatis of 1 614, the Confessio Fraternitatis R C of 1615, and the Chymische Hochzeit Christiani Rosenkreuz of 1616. The Fama and Confessio purported to come from the Brothers of the Rosy Cross, a secret society which announced an imminent reformation of the whole world and invited prospective members to make themselves known. The Chemical Wedding is a fairy-tale describing the experiences of Christian Rosenkreuz, the legendary founder of the Brotherhood, couched in alchemical symbolism. Coming at a time when Catholics and Protestants were constantly at each other's throats, the idea of a religious reformation and reconcilia-tion was welcomed by many, but rejected by the Catholics, of whose Church the manifestoes were harshly critical. In 1615a nd 1616 Andreas Libavius issued works denigrating the Rosicrucians' doctrines as expressed in the Fama and Confessio, especially those of macro-micro-cosmic harmony, magic, Cabbala, and their use of the Hermetic texts. This was a criticism by implication of the very foundations of the massive work which Fludd already had in hand, and naturally he felt urged to defend the Rosicrucians. This he did in his Apologia Compendiaria of 1 616, also taking the opportunity to ask the Brotherhood to receive him as one of their number. Next year, in 1 61 7, he issued the Tractatus Apo-/ogeticus, an enlarged version of his Apologia, which sets out in miniature the philosophy and intentions of his major works, and the Trac-tatus Theo/ogo-Phi/osophicus, a theological discussion of life, death and resurrection, also dedicated to the Brotherhood. The enigmas surrounding the Rosicrucian manifestoes have attracted the efforts of many scholars, and still they are not altogether solved The Fama and Confessio probably came from a circle of scholars in Tub-ingen which surrounded Johann Valentin Andreae, the Protestant utop-ist who later admitted to having written the Chemical Wedding in about 1604, while in his teens. Philosophical sources for the manifestoes are traceable in the earlier mysticism of Joachim de Flore, Thomas à Kempis, Tauler, Ruysbroek, Paracelsus, and John Dee. Andreae's circle sup-posedly sent out their works as a pleasant fiction, with the serious pur-pose of pointing a way out of the agonizing religious controversies of the day. The violent reaction to their jeu d'esprit scared them, so that Andreae disowned the affair, calling it a silly jest, and turned his efforts to the foundation of 'Christian Unions'. So apparently the secret society of Rosicrucians had never really existed, whatever bodies were founded subsequently that bore the name. Thus far the scholars have disentangled the skein of Rosicrucian per-sonalities, books and events in the first three decades of the seventeenth century, and according to them we cannot properly call Fludd, or anyone else, a Rosicrucian. The fact remains, however, that there is a certain type of philosophy which combines the practical examination of nature withaspiritualviewofthe universe as an intelligent hierarchy of beings ; which draws its wisdom from all possible sources, and which sees the proper end of man as the direct knowledge of God This kind of belief underlies the manifestoes; it is presupposed in Fludd's works and in those of the alchemists; it reappears in the more esoteric aspects of Freemasonry and becomes the basis for Theosophy It is a philosophic child of Neoplatonism, and a close relative of the Eastern religions. It forms, in short, a branch of the 'Perennial Philosophy': the primordial wisdom of mankind whose traces are found everywhere but in the 10 The Rose and the Cross 'The Rose gives ihe bees honey.' This explicitly Rosicrucian symbol was first used at the head of Joachim Frizius's Summum Bonum, then adopted for Fludd's Clavis. A rose with seven circles of seven petals each alludes, in all probability, to secret doctrines of septenary emanation such as were later to be publicized m the theosophical works of H. P. Blavatsky The Rose surmounts the thorny cross, the whole resembling the sign of Venus in which the solar circle triumphs over the cross of matter. We may interpret Ihe motto as saying that 'spiritual knowledge gives solace to souls', of whom bees are a venerable symbol. The spiders' webs {also with sevenfold divisions) strung on a grape arbour in the background, and the wingless insect on the rose fa spider?) may represent negative, lunar forces, as opposed to the positive, solar one of the bees, both of which are reconciled by the philosophic rose.

As it surfaced in the Europe of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries it has been called 'Rosicrucianism', and there are worse labels for it. Hence we may certainly say that Fludd's philosophy is Rosicrucian in spirit, even if he never belonged to the Brotherhood if there was a Brotherhood. Of course it is always possible that the manifestoes achieved precisely what they purported to do. No one has gone down in history as saying that they were contacted by the Rosicrucians and enrolled tn the Brotherhood ; but if the aims and activities of the Brothers were deliber-ately kept secret, it may be that they were only interested in those people who could be trusted to reveal absolutely nothing. If that were the case, we should never know what was really going on. We could only surmise that behind the known Rosicrucian philosophers like Maier and Fludd there may have been an even more esoteric group, with purposes and methods of its own ; and we must certainly admit that the whole world has been re-formed, for better or worse, since their time. Fludd's biography from 1617 onwards is scarcely more than his biblio-graphy. The next few years saw the appearance of his History, at the rate of one fat tome a year, from the presses of Johann Theodore de Bry in the Palatinate region of Germany. Frances Yates in The Rosicru-cian Enlightenment, has pieced together the fascinating story of De Bry's work in Oppenheim and Frankfurt and its connection with the short reign of Frederick, Elector Palatine, and his wife Elizabeth, daughter of James I. The huge works of Fludd and the alchemical emblem books of Michael Maier, beautifully illustrated with engravings by De Bry and his Swiss son-in-law Matthieu Merian, take on a new meaning when placed in their political setting. The hopes of all those whose outlook could be described as 'Rosicrucian' were pinned on Frederick: hopes that he could initiate the reform of which the Fama and Confessio spoke, and heal the religious rifts that were, alas, soon to split Central Europe apart with the Thirty Years' War. To the publisher whose press formed one of the main propaganda weapons of the reforming movement, Fludd's History of the Macrocosm and Microcosm, by now probably nearing completion, must have seemed like a bible of the Rosicrucian philosophy, and no time was wasted in getting it into print. To Fludd, the De Bry firm's efficiency and experience must have come as a godsend, for he says in his answer to Foster that 'our home-borne Printers demanded of me five hundred pounds to print the first volume, and to find the cuts in copper; but, beyond the seas, it was printed at no cost of mine, and that as I would wish. And I had 16 copies sent me over, with 40 pounds in gold, as an unexpected gratuitie for it.' (p. 21 ) This sounds like royal patronage indeed. Volume I and the first part of Volume II were duly completed and published in rapid succession in 1 617-2Û. But the scale of the work then began to exceed all reasonable proportions as Fludd proceeded to divide and subdivide it in a way too complicated to describe in words, but easily understood from a table (p. 93). By the time Phi/osophia Sacra appeared in 1 626, being Portion IV of Section I of Tractate II of Volume II, the master plan was beyond repair, and Fludd abandoned it, only to launch a new one three years later. His second major scheme, somewhat less ambitious, was the Medi-cina Catholica, a universal medicat textbook in two volumes {see table, p. 93). Its parts came out from 1629 to 1631, completing the first of two promised volumes. Then that, too, was left unfinished, and Fludd wrote no more extensive works until the Phi/osophia Moysaica, a fairly succinct summation of his philosophy, appearing posthumously in 1 638. 11"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"His other books are best understood as incidental to his two great compendia, prompted for the most part by an almost pathological sensi-tivity to criticism. I have already mentioned the defensive positions of his early Rosicrucian works, and of the manuscript treatises Dec/aratio Brevis and A Philosophical! Key. His other controversial writings, with their prompters, are as follows: 161 9 Johannes Kepler criticizes Fludd's ideas of world harmony in his Harmonices mundi 1621 Fludd answers Kepler in Veritatis Proscenium. 1621 /2 Kepler answers with his Prodromus dissertationum cosmo-graphicum. 1623 Fludd answers Kepler again in Monochordum Mundi, issued as part of Anatomiae Amphitheatrum Marin Mersenne attacks Fludd and the Hermetic philosophy in Quaes-tiones celeberrimae in Genesim. Patrick Scot disparages alchemy in The Tillage of Light 1624? Fludd answers Scot in a manuscript entitled Truth's Golden Harrow. 1628 Lanovius (François de La Noue) condemns Fludd in Judicium de Roberto Fluddo, published 1630. 1629 Fludd answers Mersenne in Soph/ae Cum Moria Certamen Joachim Frizius answers Mersenne in Summum Bonurn 1 630 Pierre Gassendi supports Mersenne's views in Epistohca exer-c/tatio. 1631 William Foster attacks the weapon-salve in Hoplocrisma-spongus Fludd answers Foster in Doctor Fludd's Answer unto M. Foster. 1633 Fludd answers Mersenne, Gassendi and Lanovius in Clavis Philosophiae. Most of these are slight works, especially when compared with major productions like De Naturae Simia (798 pp.) or Integrum Morborum Mysterium (532 pp.). They were printed in folio format, apparently in order to match Fludd's other works, with which they are sometimes bound Fludd died at his home in Coleman Street on 8 September 1637, aged sixty-three, and was buried in Bearsted Church. The handsome monu-ment designed by him and erected by his nephew Thomas may still be seen there, although it was moved from the chancel to the vestry by a disapproving vicar towards the end of the nineteenth century The name of Robert Fludd soon passed as a mere catchword for arcane and incomprehensible philosophy, and indeed his books are not easy to read. His greatest inspirations lie not so much in his words as in the illustra-tions which he designed to accompany them. Several factors had con-spired to prepare the ground for this approach, in which graphic material played such a prominent part. First there was the immense popularity of emblem books, in which pictorial symbols were combined with mot-toes and poems to make an ethical or philosophical point, or just for the sake of a conceit. Innumerable emblem books followed on the proto type, Alciati's Emblemata (1531), and continued until well on in the seventeenth century. The idea that a picture could show what words could not tell also lay behind the beautifully illustrated alchemical texts which appeared in great numbers in the fifty years around 1600 When woodcuts gave way to copper engravings as the favourite means of printing such pictures, the quality of illustration improved markedly: a"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"change for which Theodore de Bry, father of Fludd's publisher Johann Theodore, was largely responsible through his massive illustrated books describing America and other recent discoveries. Johann Theodore de Bry himself engraved the first part of Fludd's History of the Macrocosm, but the subsequent parts were probably done by Matthieu Merian, who signed the sympathetic portrait of Fludd in Phi/osophia Sacra (our fron-tispiece) and the title-page of De Naturae Simia (plate 95), the most copiously illustrated of all his treatises. Fludd's gift for summarizing lengthy explanations in diagrammatic form makes it possible to understand much of his philosophy from his engravings alone, but I have annotated them in order to make them com-prehensible to those who are unfamiliar with Latin or with Rosicrucian doctrines. The task of tracing all the sources and descendants of his philosophy would demand a much larger work than this, but it is appro-priate here to give a brief summary of what he believed and why his work is valuable to people of the twentieth century At the head of Fludd's cosmos is one Absolute God, whom he usually represents by the Hebrew Tetragrammaton YHVH, a word that is never pronounced, just as the Absolute can never be described. This supreme, impersonal principle is beyond the distinctions of good and evil. But although it is a perfect unity, it has a dual power: it can either remain m itself, contained in a state of potentiality, or it can act. The Cabbalists call both these powers by the first letter of the Hebrew alphabet, dis-tinguishing them as the 'Light Aleph' and the 'Dark Aleph'. Fludd says that God's dark side seems like an abyss of chaos, the parent of all the evils and discord in the world. It is the source of Satan and the demons who trouble the world and fight perpetually against the angels of light. But since God's unity includes it, we must accept it as an aspect of him and hence ultimately good. God's active state, on the other hand, is obviously good, for it gives the whole universe being and sustains it with all its creatures. Fludd expresses the problem thus in his Mosaicall Philosophy : Touching the explication of this most profound Sphyng/an Riddle or abstruse question, namely Why God in his secret sense or mentall intent did raise up and ordain out of the informed matter or Ideally delineated in himself, these two contrarieties, to cause thereby that all things in the world, should be put into a mutuall dissonance, or fight and conflict with one another, so that there is found nothing which participateth of goodness, which hath not his contrary; that is to say, which doth not communicate with badness (m so much that God himself is not without an adversary) verily it is too occult a Caball to be explained by mortal! capacity, being that it may well be esteemed the profoundest secret of all the divine mysteries ... neither verily doth it become us of our selves to enquire why God made this or that, or thus or after this fashion. But it behoveth the zealous to refer all this unto the time when the secrets shall be dis-covered, which will come to pass, when the seventh Seal shall be opened: for then that high mystery, which is the finall cause, why and for what end God's Providence will by these two opposits reveal it self, and clean extinguish all enmity out of the world, shall be dis-covered. ... So that as two contrarieties or discords, proceeded from one Unity or unison, namely Light and Darkness from one Divine Essence; So also these two dissonant branches or confusion of Uni-ties, will at the last be reduced or return again into one harmonious Unity, in which there will be found no dissonancy. ... (p. 144) 13 5"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"Fludd was very interested in the process of creation, on all levels, and anxious to find the common ground of the creation myths in the two books he most respected: the Bible and the Corpus Hermet/cum. He explains the creation of the universe as the result of a ray of God's active light, sent out into the void and diminishing gradually as it went farther from him. Around it the darkness coalesced in the form of matter. The stronger the ray, the less matter could exist in its presence. But in the outer reaches of God's illumination, the darkness gradually pre-vailed over light, exceeding and finally extinguishing it. The various com-pounds of spirit and matter became worlds and regions of worlds, of which there are three main divisions: first, the empyrean world, or Heaven, where light exceeds darkness, the latter taking the form of exceedingly rarefied matter; second, the ethereal world, equally com-pounded of light and darkness into a substance we call ether; third, the elemental world, where darkness predominates over light, producing the traditional four states of matter: fiery, gaseous, liquid and solid. Far from being lifeless, material spaces, all these worlds are thronged with beings: the empyrean with angels, the ethereal with stars, planets and demons, the elemental with men, animals, plants and minerals. All these creatures partake of God's light in measure accordmg to their place on the hierarchy. But there is one level in particular which, though not at the top of the hierarchy, is nevertheless particularly favoured by God. This is the Sun, which is placed at the crucial midpoint of the chain of being, where spirit and matter are in perfect equity and balance. God has made the Sun his tabernacle, and from this secondary residence his active power radiates anew to all the lower realms. At the beginning of his History of the Macrocosm Fludd describes the world and its divisions : Martianus [Capella] has a threefold interpretation of the word 'world'. (1) As an archetype whose substance is incorporeal, invisible, in-tellectual and sempiternal; after whose model and divine image the beauty and form of the real world are constructed (as Boethius says) : and this world remains permanently in the divine mind. (2) As a non-celestial body, i.e. the greater world that is bounded and contained by the concavity of the Primum Mobile: and this world is, by the will of God, eternal. (3) As man, who is called the lesser world, and is said to be perpetual in form but corruptible in body. We differ little from Marti anus's opinion in treating the world as duplex : the Macro-cosm and the Microcosm. The first is to be distinguished from man, the Microcosm, in that it designates the entire space of prime matter as a world, a Cosmos, or a Macrocosm: for the spiritual light, or the spirit of God, encircles both waters in its embrace. This portion of the abyss is composed of a circle of manifold lights and darknesses, divided into three regions according to their degrees of purity and impurity. The highest is the region of the world where the igneous spirit is prepared, and the primary substance of light contained, extending inwards from the sphere of the Trinity as far as the sphere of the stars. The substance of this region of the world is so subtle and pure, on account of its form, that it is altogether imperceptible to our senses. Hence the Philosophers call it intellectual, and in its highest stage spiritual. The middle region is adorned by stars, both fixed and moving, and occupies the concavity between the spheres of the Primum Mobile and that of the moon. Thence proceeds the manifest region, the world-mass, in two principal parts: the higher one incorporeal, spiritual, most pure and subtle, and the other cor-"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"poreal. This corporeal region is again divided into two parts: the middle one is subtle, tenuous and incorruptible, and the lower is the sublunary or elemental region, impure, gross and reeking of corrup-tion. These the ancient Philosophers call the regions of the Macro cosm, and the Scriptures call the Heavens. But they call the highest one the Empyrean or fiery heaven, for it is filled with spiritual fire or the substance of light. And it was into that third heaven, which he called Paradise, that Saint Paul was taken in the spirit. The scriptures generally call the middle region the ethereal or 'lucid' heaven, or simply 'heaven'. (UCH I, a, pp. 45—6) God's powers, says Fludd, are borne into these three worlds by his ministers. The angels are the servants of his light aspect, and the devils of his darkness: two parallel hierarchies which strive perpetually one against the other. They are not exactly equal, however, for the devils were beaten down from the empyrean heaven by the Archangel Michael and his hosts before the lower worlds were ever created, and Michael then took up his abode in the Sun. Fludd's theogony and angelology are complicated and intertwined in such a way that some very remarkable conclusions emerge. His most important concepts are those of Nature, the Anima Mundi (World Soul), the Cabbalists' Metatron, the Archangel Michael, the Messiah, and God the Son. Nature is the feminine, maternal principle, of whom Fludd writes in the early Tractatus Theologo-Philosophicus : This Nature is the noblest daughter of the Creator, obedient to the maker of the Earthly Paradise and of herself, and to the holy Spirit of wisdom; so imbued is she with his Word and with supercelestial Nectar, that she is surrounded with the perpetual splendour of eternal Life and protected with the sword of blazing light against the in-vasions of the impious. She reveals her essence and virtue to none but the sons of God, to whom it is given to know the 'Word that shineth in the darkness and by whom all things were made' This noble and most pure Virgin is decked with such divine light, that some have wondered whether this splendid Nature, this Psyche, minister of life to all creatures, is herself God, or whether God himself is she, since the airy virtue of the admirable Father and Son, or the holy Spirit of intelligence, has placed its tabernacle in her. Happy is he who shall taste of her limpid waters, for he will be exalted with the splendour of the Word and the rays of the Spirit's teaching.... This immaculate Nymph desires assiduously the presence, society and assistance of her Deiform spouse, that she may lead her work to still greater perfec-tion. . . Thus this most fair sister, immaculate dove and friend, speaks to her beloved from the depths of her desire: 'stay me with flowers, comfort me with apples, for I am sick with love' (Song of Solomon, 2, 5). Therefore the Philosopher in his sacred sermon also says 'Out of the light a Word was made and descended on Nature, warming her' (Pimander, 1, 5) Similarly the Spirit of the Lord, which is the igneous love having the virtue of the Father and the Word, was borne over the waters and gave them its fiery vigour. So this burning love, a flashing Spirit of wisdom, is that true and supercelestial desire, pro-jecting its igneous seeds into the matrix of the universal waters .. . that is, into the womb of Physis, whose chosen daughter is the immaculate Psyche and bride of the bridegroom, (pp 36 7) A feminine aspect of divinity is an ingredient of most religions, and in Catholic Christianity this is supplied by the Vit gin Mary Protestants, 15"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"to their loss, have rejected the deification of the Virgin Mother, but they do not thereby annul the psychological and spiritual need for her. An exclusively male god does not warm the emotions of many people, and the way of divine love, which in Hinduism is called 'bhakti', is more often directed to an all-loving female figure. Fludd's eloquent praise of Nature shows that she is such a figure to him. He describes her in meta-physical terms as God's first creation and also his spouse. This idea, so alien to conventional theology, is simply a way of saying that the Abso-lute One must make a Second before a universe can be produced. These profound principles have been studied and described more systematic-ally in the East than in the modern West, and Fludd's account takes on new clarity when associated with the Hindu duality of Purusha and Prakriti. Nature in her highest aspect is Prakriti, the cosmic substance which is formless and void until the cosmic thought of Purusha enters and inseminates it. From that union, and not from either principle alone, a world can be born : for at the supreme level of the self-existent, absolute Brahma, the One without a Second, there is no Purusha, no Prakriti, and no world. Fludd seems in the above quotation to be speaking of a lower level of the primordial duality, where the manifested Logos or Word finds in Virgin Nature its field of activity. She comprises the potential creative forces that will go to make a universe, once they are 'known' by the Logos. In order for a human being to know her, he must unify his splintered perceptions and experience the pure presentation of know-ledge as a whole, thus transcending the world of Maya which is born from her. In later works Fludd speaks less of Nature and more of the World Soul. This is the same thing : the creative forces of light, will, intellect, and so on, which sustain any cosmic entity. He describes thus the origin of the World Soul: the Logos gives off an emanation of light, which is the 'Eternal Spirit of Wisdom'. This creative principle [Purusha] infuses the humid chaos [Prakriti], turning it from a potential state to an active one, so that it becomes the substratum for the world. From the world's point of view, this divine light is its very soul ; in the words of the Mosar call Philosophy, 'the soul of the world, or Mens divina in mundo [the divine Mind in the world], simply taken, is the divine mentall emanation absolutely in it self, being distinguished from the created spirit' (p. 149). In the same chapter Fludd draws a parallel from the individual soul. That Anima is nothing else, but that which doth animate or vivifie a body or spirit : why then should not the catholick divine Spirit which filleth all, and operateth all, and in all, be tearmed the fountain of the world's life; by which it liveth, moveth, and hath its being, and consequently the essentiall life, and Centrall or mental soul of the world, moving the created humid spirit thereof... (p. 1 50) Fludd recognized that the Jewish Cabbala described exactly the same principle as Metatron, which he translates as the gift of God'. This prin-ciple, ... whom they make the catholick intellectual Agent, is nothing else but that universall Spirit of Wisdome which God sent out of his own mouth, as the greatest gift and token of his benignity unto each world, and the members thereof: to reduce them from deformity, and non-existence, into act and formall being. . . . And this therefore was tearmed rightly in the etes of wise men Mitattron or Donum Dei calho-"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"l/cum, which reduceth the universall Nothing into a universafi * Something (pp 151 2) That Fludd considered this principle to be none other than the second person of the Christian Trinity emerges from statements in his answer to Kepler, printed with Anatomise Amphitheatrum. Here he actually says that the Light Aleph is the Son, or Wisdom, or Light, or the Word; 'And the Platonists accept this \"Wisdom'' of the Hebrews, and \"Messiah\" of the Christians, and \"Mittatron\" of the Cabbalists, and \"Word\" of the Prophets and Apostles as the true Soul of the World, whom they say filled harmonically all the intervals of the world in threes, squared and cubed . . (pp. 302 3). The reference here is to the description of the world's creation in Plato's Timacus where, following Pythagorean number theory, Plato shows how the universe is organized mathematically and harmonically. Modern physicists would have to agree in principle, having discovered that matter is nothing but quasi-mathematical entities in a state of vibra-tion. But Fludd's Catholic critics objected to his syncretistic mind, which could see the essential truth in any doctrine, whether Greek, Chaldaean, Hebrew or Christian. Marin Mersenne, his most virulent opponent, said that nothing could be more impious than Fludd's doctrine, which he summarized thus : Compounded from God and this ethereal Spirit is the Anima Mundi. The purest part of this Soul is the Angelic nature and the Empyrean heaven, which is understood to be mixed into all things. The Demons are part of the same essence, but joined to evil material. All souls, whether of men or of brutes, are none other than particles of this same Soul. This Soul is also the Angel Michael or M/sattron What is more, the same Soul is the true Messiah, Saviour, Christ, corner stone and universal rock, on which the Church and all salvation are founded (Merse;nne's Lettres, II, p. 441) What outraged Mersenne was the idea that Christ should be reduced to parity with the World Soul, or, worse, a mere angel But although m the seventeenth century it was dangerous to say as much, Fludd seems to have known intuitively what esoteric doctrines have taught in every culture : that there are great beings who watch over the planetary bodies, and who on occasion descend as Messiahs, Buddhas, Avatars and Christs. These beings, exalted as they are, are obviously not the same as the Absolute Principle of the whole universe. Fludd himself explains that these principles are not all on the same level of being. They are, rather, different manifestations of a single pnn ciple in different worlds. In Phitosophia Moysaica he also writes The more secret Theologians and those most expert in true Cabbala say that just as Mind has domination in the human Soul, thus does Mettatron in the celestial world, where fie rules from the Sun. and the Soul of the Messiah in the Angelic world, and Adonai in the Archetypal [world]. And to the degree to which the active intellect of Mind is the light of the soul, even so the light of that same Mettatron or World's Soul is Sadai, and the light of the Messiah's soul is Elchai. which signifies the living God, and the light of Adonai is Ensoph, signifying the infinity of Divinity The world's soul is therefore Metta tron, whose light is the Soul of the Messiah or of the Tetragramma-ton s virtue, in which is the light of the living God, in which is the light of Ensoph, beyond which there is no progression (p. 304) 17"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"This may be expressed diagrammatically : En Soph the Infinite is the light of Adonai the Lord who rules m the Archetypal world Elchai the living God Soul of the Messiah YHVH's Virtue \" Angelic world Sadai all-powerful \" Metatron Anima Mundi \" Celestial world Mind | Human Soul and rules there Space does not permit a fuller discussion of this subject. Readers who wish to pursue it in its cabbalistic aspect would do well to consult the definitions of these Hebrew names in Leo Schaya's The Universal Mean-ing of the Kabbalah (1971), where the spellings differ slightly: Fl hai for E/chai, Shaddai for Sadat. Another of Fludd's deepest concerns was with the idea of harmony between microcosm and macrocosm. According to this, man is a miniature universe and the universe is a great being; therefore if one understands the lesser cosmos, one will comprehend the greater. This is the true meaning of the Creator's words in Genesis, 'Let us make man in our own image', and of the Hermetic axiom, 'That which is above is like unto that which is below.' Modern science has disproved this venerable notion of correspondence to its own satisfaction, through the simple expedient of ignoring every level of being bul one : the material. But Fludd would have been the first to protest that the material bodies of men and planets alike are their least important vehicles. What really correspond with the macrocosmic entities are man's subtle bodies, and it will be the task of astrology in years to come to identify, on a philo-sophical as well as a mundane level, the exact correspondences and their meanings. Harmony implies relationships, and nowhere are quantitative relation-ships so keenly felt as when they are manifested in music. Here quantity becomes quality, and arithmetic is experienced as feeling ; the ratio 2 3 flowers into the unmistakable sound of a perfect fifth, and so on Our modern experience with digital computers shows that more and more of our knowledge can be expressed as relationships between simple numbers. As an inheritor of the Pythagorean-Platonic tradition, Fludd also appreciated this, but expressed it in the life-enhancing language of musical harmony. The chords and intervals which he heard between the levels of the universe may not be scientifically demonstrable or even accurate, but they testify to h is faith inanorderly world, in which nothing is related by chance and all is imbued with a harmony which we will one day understand and hear for ourselves His contemporary, Shake-speare, wrote that Such harmony is in immortal souls', knowing that the discords of Earth are resolved when our centre of consciousness rises to a higher level. I have dwelt on these few areas of Fludd's thought to the exclusion of others because they illustrate his utter independence from sectarian Christian theology, his readiness to recognize wisdom wherever he saw it, and his firm grasp of the theory of multiple states of being. All three features set him apart from the dominant philosophical and theological concerns of his own day and of the centuries that followed. Yet these are precisely the things that have always separated esoteric thinkers from the simplistic and exclusive doctrines of exoteric religion.

Raleigh. Spenser, and others associated with underground spiritual movements Whether Fludd was connected with any of these is a question for specialists m this controversial field second features are natural for those who recognize that God and his wisdom are not the preserve of any one sect or creed; but this requires a view of humanity and God that transcends one's immediate milieu: even more of a rarity in the seventeenth century than it is today. The third feature is allied to the others, for it involves a realization of the relativity of all standpoints: what is valid on one level may have to be sacrificed on a higher one. This is illustrated most impressively by Fludd's synthesis of both good and evil in the Absolute. The levels of being form the principal subject of so many of his plates that they must have been Fludd's major concern. The fact that he illus-trates them with reference to a geocentric universe is irrelevant : the Pto-lemaic system is not true physically, but symbolically it is still entirely valid From our position as embodied human beings on a physical earth, the universe does seem to turn around us, and we each feel and behave as if we were the centre of it. Any expansion of consciousness is an ascent through the 'spheres' or spiritual states which the planets symbol-ize, and an escape from the earth' of our physical being and shackling ego. The writings of all traditions lend their support to this idea of the soul's ascent, which Fludd saw as the ultimate goal of man, as well as to the existence of unseen higher worlds compounded either of finer states of matter (etheric, astral, etc.) or simply of different states of mind. Fludd used the former metaphor, and this has brought upon him the incongruous label of 'materialist' from those to whom matter and mind are an irreconcilable duality. Robert Fludd is a link in the chain of Christian esotericism which in-cludes figures as disparate as Origen, Hildegard, Eckhart, Ficino, Boehme, Emerson and Steiner ; and he seems to have received his arcane knowledge not only from other writers but from the same source as all true theosophists before and since. Such people are often at variance with the established Churches, to whose authority they offer the chal-lenge of a personal revelation Cutting through the crystallizations of dogma, they approach the spiritual world directly, returning with a new vision of its inexhaustible riches. It was Fludd's virtue that he could present his vital teachings unmarred by his own psychology, and thus his work has always been prized as an inspired vehicle for universal truth. 19"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"I The Macrocosm The creation of the universe and the metaphysical principles that govern it Passages in the commentaries to the plates which are in quotation marks are either Fludd's own words or else paraphrases of them Page references are to the same book from which the plate is taken, unless otherwise indicated For key to the abbreviated titles (UCH. etc ), see Bibliography 1 The Solar Logos The Sun is the brightest object visible to mortal sight, and a universal symbol of the Supreme Deity While Fludd did not accept the Copernican doctrine of the Sun as centre of the material universe, like Ficino he did accord it absolute primacy in the planetary order, as the midpoint of the chain of being stretching from Heaven to Earth The Sun in the sky, like the heart in the human body, is God's most immediate manifestation on its particular level (see plate 39) UCH I, a, p 19 2 The Ptolemaic Universe / From the infinite light of God (Deus). a spiral descends to the uttermost depths of matter The Absolute creates by limiting its own infinity, in an act described by the caption The simplex unity; the beginning, the starting point, source of essences, the first act; the Being of beings.

Take a man who weighs 200 lbs when alive his corpse may weigh 240 lbs The difference of 60 pounds' weight of vital spirit would be enough to lift his [vital?] body to the sphere of the Sun!'

UCH I. b. p 13 97 Apollo and the Muses This emblem heads Fludd's treatise on music It is a common enough scene, best known from Raphael's version in the Vatican The god Apollo sits under a laurel tree on Parnassus with his head enveloped in a solar nimbus In his hand is a seven-stringed lyre, indicating that as Sun God he is leader of the choir of planets He is a personification of the regulating, harmonizing forces in the universe, and as such is aptly associated with music, in which these forces are made audible Around him are the nine Muses, some holding musical instruments lyre, cornetto. bass viol, lute, cornetto (on the ground) and straight trumpet The Muses traditionally preside over the Arts, dispensing inspiration to mortals They are femmes inspiratrices : images of the Anima; or the levels of the soul from which true artistic creation arises UCH I. b. p 159 77"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"98 98 The Round Tower In the commentary on this enlarged detail of the Temple, the subject of the next plate. Fludd defines sound as made by the striking of air with the consequent vibrations which propagate in spirals and circles (p 168) These are fancifully drawn above the two doors which represent the ears, sole entrances of sound Might it be too fanciful to see the spiral also as a reference to the cochlea of the inner ear? Unfortunately Fludd's Anatomiae Amphithealrum, which has very detailed dissection drawings of the human eye. barely mentions the apparatus of hearing, so we do not know the extent of his knowledge The doors are flanked by panels containing (left) harp, organ, cornetto, (right) viol, cittern and lute On the left is Apollo with a lute, on the right Marsyas with pan-pipes In the engraving of the complete temple, the place of the latter is taken by a curious profile mask The legend of the musical contest between Apollo and the satyr Marsyas. which ended with the flaying of the loser, was philosophically interpreted to represent the painful liberation from one's earthly body (the satyr's skin) in order to hear Apollo's lyre, i.e experience the celestial worlds (see Edgar Wind, Pagan Mysteries in the Renaissance, pp 171 6) But whilst this muddy vesture of decay Doth grossly close it in. we cannot hear it (The Merchant of Venice V. i) Perhaps the harmony in immortal souls' is indicated by the decorated circles that surmount the edifice, one of them full of young-ey'd chérubins'. UCH I, b, p 168 99 The Temple of Music This extraordinary structure, obviously influenced by Renaissance theatrical architecture, was probably conceived as a mnemonic device for the rules of music Proceeding along the bottom we find first a lute, an instrument which Fludd honours with the following encomium No other invention, ancient or modern, is more seemly for consorts nor more desirable for symphonies, nor more admirable to the ears of listeners Time destroys not the sweetness of its sounds, neither do fickle inventions seduce men's affections from it. however rare, unusual, or more easily learnt these may be ' (p 226) Next is the famous scene of Pythagoras entering the forge in which he noticed the consonant pitches produced by four hammers Examining the hammers, he found their weights in the proportion 12. 9. 8 and 6, giving the intervals of fourth, fifth and octave The massive foundation obscuring the remainder of the arcade is in the form of a staff with a bass clef The lowest note is G. the bottom of the gamut, and as the notes proceed up the scale so their values get smaller, from maximus to semifusa (the latter equal to our quaver or eighth-note). This is the basis which the rest of the temple amplifies In the second storey we find first a column-monochord with the notes of the gamut marked off for two octaves, two higher octaves being indicated only by Gs Skipping the chart, we come to another gamut between the first two Tuscan columns, running up from F to a\" the normal limits of most music in Fludd's day The next three spaces explain the three species of hexachords. the six note scales' of medieval music whose lowest note. ut'. could fall on an F. C or G These were called respectively the soft, natural and hard hexachords In the engraving the soft hexachord is surmounted by a round tower and round organ pipes, the hard hexachord by square ones. These reflect the different versions of the note B as it falls in the respective hexachords: in the soft one it sounds B flat, written with a round b that became the familiar flat sign, in the hard one it sounds B natural, written with a square b which survives in our natural sign These two accidentals may be seen in the top of the ground-floor arcadtng The natural hexachord runs for six notes up from C, hence avoids B altogether It being the highest of the three. Fludd likens it to the highest element, fire, and gives it the highest tower, pointed like a flame We consider next the clock above Apollo Aptly surmounted by Father Time, the upper dial shows 12 hours, the lower one the different note-values The two outer circles contain the notes and their relationships 1 maxima (Fludd calls it larga) equals 2 longs. 4 breves, 8 semibreves. 16 minims, 32 semiminims. 64 fusae. 128 semifusae (The last note should have two flags on its tail.) To each of these are added their appropriate rests For some reason each is also accompanied by a note of the next value down, but this system fails when the fusa is reached The area above Pythagoras is divided diagonally On the left is the Platonic lambda, described in the Timaeus There are two errors, rectified in the text (p 204): 16 should be 12, and 24 should be 27 The ramifications of this net' are vast, but here it serves simply to show the proportions of note-values to each other In medieval and Renaissance notation a breve could contain either 4, 6, or 9 minims, depending on the time signature The possibilities for longer notes were correspondingly greater The 'chess-board' is an aid to composition, constructed rather like the charts which show the mileage between cities it shows the distances between the notes of the scale But it only gives consonances Suppose one has written 78"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"a low A and wants to write a middle C against it.

Born in Elizabethan England, he became a convinced occultist while travelling on the Continent, and thereafter followed a career as a Paracelsian physician. His voluminous writings were devoted to defending the philosophy of the alchemists and Rosicrucians, and applying their doctrines to a vast description of man and the universe. Expounding the ideas of cosmic harmony, the multiple levels of existence and the correlations between them, Fludd summarizes esoteric teachings common to all ages and peoples. Far ahead of his time in some respects, he recognized the univer-sality of truth, welcoming it whether it came from Catholic or Protestant sources, from the Hebrew Bible, from Pythagoras, Plato or Hermes Tris-megistus. Fludd had a genius for expressing his philosophy and cosmology in graphic form, and his works were copiously illustrated by some of the best engravers of his day. All Fludd's important plates are collected here for the first time, annotated and explained, together with an Introduction to his life and thought. The author is a musicologist who has made a study of Oriental philosophies and comparative religion. Since 1971 he has been on the Music Faculty of Colgate University, New York State. I le is currently working on a companion volume on Athanasius Kircher, and researching the occult and philosophical aspects of music.
