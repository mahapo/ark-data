Or rather was not the proposal too singular to beforgotten? for all wives and children wereto be in common, to the intent that no one shouldever know his own child, but they were to imaginethat they were all one family; those who were within asuitable limit of age were to be brothers and sisters,those who were of an elder generation parents andgrandparents, and those of a younger, children andgrandchildren.TIMAEUS: Yes, and the proposal is easy to remember, asyou say.SOCRATES: And do you also remember how, with a viewof securing as far as we could the best breed, we saidthat the chief magistrates, male and female, should con-trive secretly, by the use of certain lots, so to arrangethe nuptial meeting, that the bad of either sex and thegood of either sex might pair with their like; and therewas to be no quarrelling on this account, for they wouldimagine that the union was a mere accident, and wasto be attributed to the lot?TIMAEUS: I remember.SOCRATES: And you remember how we said that thechildren of the good parents were to be educated, andthe children of the bad secretly dispersed among theinferior citizens; and while they were all growing upthe rulers were to be on the look-out, and to bring upfrom below in their turn those who were worthy, andPlato’s “Timaeus”5"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"those among themselves who were unworthy were totake the places of those who came up?TIMAEUS: True.SOCRATES: Then have I now given you all the heads ofour yesterday’s discussion? Or is there anything more,my dear Timaeus, which has been omitted?TIMAEUS: Nothing, Socrates; it was just as you havesaid.SOCRATES: I should like, before proceeding further, totell you how I feel about the State which we havedescribed. I might compare myself to a person who, onbeholding beautiful animals either created by thepainter’s art, or, better still, alive but at rest, is seizedwith a desire of seeing them in motion or engaged insome struggle or conflict to which their forms appearsuited; this is my feeling about the State which wehave been describing. There are conflicts which all cit-ies undergo, and I should like to hear some one tell ofour own city carrying on a struggle against herneighbours, and how she went out to war in a becom-ing manner, and when at war showed by the greatnessof her actions and the magnanimity of her words indealing with other cities a result worthy of her trainingand education. Now I, Critias and Hermocrates, am con-scious that I myself should never be able to celebratethe city and her citizens in a befitting manner, and Iam not surprised at my own incapacity; to me the won-der is rather that the poets present as well as past areno better—not that I mean to depreciate them; butevery one can see that they are a tribe of imitators, andwill imitate best and most easily the life in which theyhave been brought up; while that which is beyond therange of a man’s education he finds hard to carry outin action, and still harder adequately to represent inlanguage. I am aware that the Sophists have plenty ofbrave words and fair conceits, but I am afraid thatbeing only wanderers from one city to another, andhaving never had habitations of their own, they mayPlato’s “Timaeus”6"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"fail in their conception of philosophers and statesmen,and may not know what they do and say in time ofwar, when they are fighting or holding parley withtheir enemies. And thus people of your class are theonly ones remaining who are fitted by nature and edu-cation to take part at once both in politics and philoso-phy. Here is Timaeus, of Locris in Italy, a city which hasadmirable laws, and who is himself in wealth and rankthe equal of any of his fellow-citizens; he has held themost important and honourable offices in his own state,and, as I believe, has scaled the heights of all philoso-phy; and here is Critias, whom every Athenian knowsto be no novice in the matters of which we are speak-ing; and as to Hermocrates, I am assured by many wit-nesses that his genius and education qualify him totake part in any speculation of the kind. And thereforeyesterday when I saw that you wanted me to describethe formation of the State, I readily assented, beingvery well aware, that, if you only would, none werebetter qualified to carry the discussion further, andthat when you had engaged our city in a suitable war,you of all men living could best exhibit her playing afitting part. When I had completed my task, I in returnimposed this other task upon you. You conferred to-gether and agreed to entertain me to-day, as I hadentertained you, with a feast of discourse. Here am I infestive array, and no man can be more ready for thepromised banquet.HERMOCRATES: And we too, Socrates, as Timaeus says,will not be wanting in enthusiasm; and there is noexcuse for not complying with your request. As soonas we arrived yesterday at the guest-chamber of Critias,with whom we are staying, or rather on our way thither,we talked the matter over, and he told us an ancienttradition, which I wish, Critias, that you would repeatto Socrates, so that he may help us to judge whether itwill satisfy his requirements or not.CRITIAS: I will, if Timaeus, who is our other partner,approves.Plato’s “Timaeus”7"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"TIMAEUS: I quite approve.CRITIAS: Then listen, Socrates, to a tale which, thoughstrange, is certainly true, having been attested by So-lon, who was the wisest of the seven sages. He was arelative and a dear friend of my great-grandfather,Dropides, as he himself says in many passages of hispoems; and he told the story to Critias, my grandfa-ther, who remembered and repeated it to us. Therewere of old, he said, great and marvellous actions ofthe Athenian city, which have passed into oblivionthrough lapse of time and the destruction of mankind,and one in particular, greater than all the rest. This wewill now rehearse. It will be a fitting monument of ourgratitude to you, and a hymn of praise true and worthyof the goddess, on this her day of festival.SOCRATES: Very good. And what is this ancient famousaction of the Athenians, which Critias declared, on theauthority of Solon, to be not a mere legend, but anactual fact?CRITIAS: I will tell an old-world story which I heardfrom an aged man; for Critias, at the time of telling it,was, as he said, nearly ninety years of age, and I wasabout ten. Now the day was that day of the Apaturiawhich is called the Registration of Youth, at which,according to custom, our parents gave prizes for reci-tations, and the poems of several poets were recited byus boys, and many of us sang the poems of Solon,which at that time had not gone out of fashion. One ofour tribe, either because he thought so or to pleaseCritias, said that in his judgment Solon was not onlythe wisest of men, but also the noblest of poets. Theold man, as I very well remember, brightened up athearing this and said, smiling: Yes, Amynander, if Solonhad only, like other poets, made poetry the business ofhis life, and had completed the tale which he broughtwith him from Egypt, and had not been compelled, byreason of the factions and troubles which he foundstirring in his own country when he came home, toattend to other matters, in my opinion he would havebeen as famous as Homer or Hesiod, or any poet.Plato’s “Timaeus”8"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"And what was the tale about, Critias? said Amynander.About the greatest action which the Athenians everdid, and which ought to have been the most famous,but, through the lapse of time and the destruction ofthe actors, it has not come down to us.Tell us, said the other, the whole story, and howand from whom Solon heard this veritable tradi-tion.He replied:—In the Egyptian Delta, at the head ofwhich the river Nile divides, there is a certain districtwhich is called the district of Sais, and the great city ofthe district is also called Sais, and is the city from whichKing Amasis came. The citizens have a deity for theirfoundress; she is called in the Egyptian tongue Neith,and is asserted by them to be the same whom the Hellenescall Athene; they are great lovers of the Athenians,and say that they are in some way related to them. Tothis city came Solon, and was received there with greathonour; he asked the priests who were most skilful insuch matters, about antiquity, and made the discoverythat neither he nor any other Hellene knew anythingworth mentioning about the times of old. On one occa-sion, wishing to draw them on to speak of antiquity, hebegan to tell about the most ancient things in our partof the world—about Phoroneus, who is called ‘the firstman,’ and about Niobe; and after the Deluge, of thesurvival of Deucalion and Pyrrha; and he traced thegenealogy of their descendants, and reckoning up thedates, tried to compute how many years ago the eventsof which he was speaking happened. Thereupon one ofthe priests, who was of a very great age, said: O Solon,Solon, you Hellenes are never anything but children,and there is not an old man among you. Solon in re-turn asked him what he meant. I mean to say, he re-plied, that in mind you are all young; there is no oldopinion handed down among you by ancient tradition,nor any science which is hoary with age. And I will tellyou why. There have been, and will be again, manydestructions of mankind arising out of many causes;the greatest have been brought about by the agenciesof fire and water, and other lesser ones by innumerableother causes. There is a story, which even you havePlato’s “Timaeus”9"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"preserved, that once upon a time Paethon, the son ofHelios, having yoked the steeds in his father’s chariot,because he was not able to drive them in the path ofhis father, burnt up all that was upon the earth, andwas himself destroyed by a thunderbolt. Now this hasthe form of a myth, but really signifies a declination ofthe bodies moving in the heavens around the earth,and a great conflagration of things upon the earth,which recurs after long intervals; at such times thosewho live upon the mountains and in dry and lofty placesare more liable to destruction than those who dwell byrivers or on the seashore. And from this calamity theNile, who is our never-failing saviour, delivers and pre-serves us. When, on the other hand, the gods purgethe earth with a deluge of water, the survivors in yourcountry are herdsmen and shepherds who dwell on themountains, but those who, like you, live in cities arecarried by the rivers into the sea. Whereas in this land,neither then nor at any other time, does the watercome down from above on the fields, having always atendency to come up from below; for which reason thetraditions preserved here are the most ancient. Thefact is, that wherever the extremity of winter frost orof summer sun does not prevent, mankind exist, some-times in greater, sometimes in lesser numbers. Andwhatever happened either in your country or in ours,or in any other region of which we are informed—ifthere were any actions noble or great or in any otherway remarkable, they have all been written down by usof old, and are preserved in our temples. Whereas justwhen you and other nations are beginning to be pro-vided with letters and the other requisites of civilizedlife, after the usual interval, the stream from heaven,like a pestilence, comes pouring down, and leaves onlythose of you who are destitute of letters and educa-tion; and so you have to begin all over again like chil-dren, and know nothing of what happened in ancienttimes, either among us or among yourselves. As forthose genealogies of yours which you just now re-counted to us, Solon, they are no better than the talesof children. In the first place you remember a singledeluge only, but there were many previous ones; in thePlato’s “Timaeus”10"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"next place, you do not know that there formerly dweltin your land the fairest and noblest race of men whichever lived, and that you and your whole city are de-scended from a small seed or remnant of them whichsurvived. And this was unknown to you, because, formany generations, the survivors of that destructiondied, leaving no written word. For there was a time,Solon, before the great deluge of all, when the citywhich now is Athens was first in war and in every waythe best governed of all cities, is said to have performedthe noblest deeds and to have had the fairest constitu-tion of any of which tradition tells, under the face ofheaven. Solon marvelled at his words, and earnestlyrequested the priests to inform him exactly and in or-der about these former citizens. You are welcome tohear about them, Solon, said the priest, both for yourown sake and for that of your city, and above all, forthe sake of the goddess who is the common patron andparent and educator of both our cities. She foundedyour city a thousand years before ours (Observe thatPlato gives the same date (9000 years ago) for the foun-dation of Athens and for the repulse of the invasionfrom Atlantis (Crit.).), receiving from the Earth andHephaestus the seed of your race, and afterwards shefounded ours, of which the constitution is recorded inour sacred registers to be 8000 years old. As touchingyour citizens of 9000 years ago, I will briefly informyou of their laws and of their most famous action; theexact particulars of the whole we will hereafter gothrough at our leisure in the sacred registers them-selves. If you compare these very laws with ours youwill find that many of ours are the counterpart of yoursas they were in the olden time. In the first place, thereis the caste of priests, which is separated from all theothers; next, there are the artificers, who ply theirseveral crafts by themselves and do not intermix; andalso there is the class of shepherds and of hunters, aswell as that of husbandmen; and you will observe, too,that the warriors in Egypt are distinct from all theother classes, and are commanded by the law to devotethemselves solely to military pursuits; moreover, theweapons which they carry are shields and spears, aPlato’s “Timaeus”11"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"style of equipment which the goddess taught of Asiat-ics first to us, as in your part of the world first to you.Then as to wisdom, do you observe how our law fromthe very first made a study of the whole order of things,extending even to prophecy and medicine which giveshealth, out of these divine elements deriving what wasneedful for human life, and adding every sort of knowl-edge which was akin to them. All this order and ar-rangement the goddess first imparted to you when es-tablishing your city; and she chose the spot of earth inwhich you were born, because she saw that the happytemperament of the seasons in that land would pro-duce the wisest of men. Wherefore the goddess, whowas a lover both of war and of wisdom, selected andfirst of all settled that spot which was the most likelyto produce men likest herself. And there you dwelt,having such laws as these and still better ones, andexcelled all mankind in all virtue, as became the chil-dren and disciples of the gods.Many great and wonderful deeds are recorded of yourstate in our histories. But one of them exceeds all therest in greatness and valour. For these histories tell of amighty power which unprovoked made an expeditionagainst the whole of Europe and Asia, and to whichyour city put an end. This power came forth out of theAtlantic Ocean, for in those days the Atlantic was navi-gable; and there was an island situated in front of thestraits which are by you called the Pillars of Heracles;the island was larger than Libya and Asia put together,and was the way to other islands, and from these youmight pass to the whole of the opposite continent whichsurrounded the true ocean; for this sea which is withinthe Straits of Heracles is only a harbour, having a nar-row entrance, but that other is a real sea, and thesurrounding land may be most truly called a boundlesscontinent. Now in this island of Atlantis there was agreat and wonderful empire which had rule over thewhole island and several others, and over parts of thecontinent, and, furthermore, the men of Atlantis hadsubjected the parts of Libya within the columns ofHeracles as far as Egypt, and of Europe as far asTyrrhenia. This vast power, gathered into one, endeav-Plato’s “Timaeus”12"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"oured to subdue at a blow our country and yours andthe whole of the region within the straits; and then,Solon, your country shone forth, in the excellence ofher virtue and strength, among all mankind. She waspre-eminent in courage and military skill, and was theleader of the Hellenes. And when the rest fell off fromher, being compelled to stand alone, after having un-dergone the very extremity of danger, she defeated andtriumphed over the invaders, and preserved from sla-very those who were not yet subjugated, and gener-ously liberated all the rest of us who dwell within thepillars. But afterwards there occurred violent earth-quakes and floods; and in a single day and night ofmisfortune all your warlike men in a body sank into theearth, and the island of Atlantis in like manner disap-peared in the depths of the sea. For which reason thesea in those parts is impassable and impenetrable, be-cause there is a shoal of mud in the way; and this wascaused by the subsidence of the island.I have told you briefly, Socrates, what the aged Critiasheard from Solon and related to us. And when youwere speaking yesterday about your city and citizens,the tale which I have just been repeating to you cameinto my mind, and I remarked with astonishment how,by some mysterious coincidence, you agreed in almostevery particular with the narrative of Solon; but I didnot like to speak at the moment. For a long time hadelapsed, and I had forgotten too much; I thought thatI must first of all run over the narrative in my ownmind, and then I would speak. And so I readily as-sented to your request yesterday, considering that inall such cases the chief difficulty is to find a tale suit-able to our purpose, and that with such a tale we shouldbe fairly well provided.And therefore, as Hermocrates has told you, on myway home yesterday I at once communicated the taleto my companions as I remembered it; and after I leftthem, during the night by thinking I recovered nearlythe whole of it. Truly, as is often said, the lessons ofour childhood make a wonderful impression on ourmemories; for I am not sure that I could remember allthe discourse of yesterday, but I should be much sur-Plato’s “Timaeus”13"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"prised if I forgot any of these things which I have heardvery long ago. I listened at the time with childlike in-terest to the old man’s narrative; he was very ready toteach me, and I asked him again and again to repeat hiswords, so that like an indelible picture they were brandedinto my mind. As soon as the day broke, I rehearsedthem as he spoke them to my companions, that they,as well as myself, might have something to say. Andnow, Socrates, to make an end of my preface, I amready to tell you the whole tale. I will give you not onlythe general heads, but the particulars, as they were toldto me. The city and citizens, which you yesterday de-scribed to us in fiction, we will now transfer to theworld of reality. It shall be the ancient city of Athens,and we will suppose that the citizens whom you imag-ined, were our veritable ancestors, of whom the priestspoke; they will perfectly harmonize, and there will beno inconsistency in saying that the citizens of your re-public are these ancient Athenians. Let us divide thesubject among us, and all endeavour according to ourability gracefully to execute the task which you haveimposed upon us. Consider then, Socrates, if this narra-tive is suited to the purpose, or whether we should seekfor some other instead.SOCRATES: And what other, Critias, can we find that willbe better than this, which is natural and suitable to thefestival of the goddess, and has the very great advantageof being a fact and not a fiction? How or where shall wefind another if we abandon this? We cannot, and there-fore you must tell the tale, and good luck to you; and Iin return for my yesterday’s discourse will now rest andbe a listener.CRITIAS: Let me proceed to explain to you, Socrates, theorder in which we have arranged our entertainment.Our intention is, that Timaeus, who is the most of anastronomer amongst us, and has made the nature of theuniverse his special study, should speak first, beginningwith the generation of the world and going down to thecreation of man; next, I am to receive the men whom hehas created, and of whom some will have profited by thePlato’s “Timaeus”14"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"excellent education which you have given them; andthen, in accordance with the tale of Solon, and equallywith his law, we will bring them into court and makethem citizens, as if they were those very Athenians whomthe sacred Egyptian record has recovered from oblivion,and thenceforward we will speak of them as Atheniansand fellow-citizens.SOCRATES: I see that I shall receive in my turn a per-fect and splendid feast of reason. And now, Timaeus,you, I suppose, should speak next, after duly callingupon the Gods.TIMAEUS: All men, Socrates, who have any degree ofright feeling, at the beginning of every enterprise,whether small or great, always call upon God. And we,too, who are going to discourse of the nature of theuniverse, how created or how existing without cre-ation, if we be not altogether out of our wits, mustinvoke the aid of Gods and Goddesses and pray that ourwords may be acceptable to them and consistent withthemselves. Let this, then, be our invocation of theGods, to which I add an exhortation of myself to speakin such manner as will be most intelligible to you, andwill most accord with my own intent.First then, in my judgment, we must make a distinc-tion and ask, What is that which always is and has nobecoming; and what is that which is always becomingand never is? That which is apprehended by intelli-gence and reason is always in the same state; but thatwhich is conceived by opinion with the help of sensa-tion and without reason, is always in a process of be-coming and perishing and never really is. Now every-thing that becomes or is created must of necessity becreated by some cause, for without a cause nothing canbe created. The work of the creator, whenever he looksto the unchangeable and fashions the form and natureof his work after an unchangeable pattern, must neces-sarily be made fair and perfect; but when he looks tothe created only, and uses a created pattern, it is notfair or perfect. Was the heaven then or the world,whether called by this or by any other more appropri-Plato’s “Timaeus”15"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"ate name—assuming the name, I am asking a questionwhich has to be asked at the beginning of an enquiryabout anything—was the world, I say, always in exist-ence and without beginning? or created, and had it abeginning? Created, I reply, being visible and tangibleand having a body, and therefore sensible; and all sen-sible things are apprehended by opinion and sense andare in a process of creation and created. Now that whichis created must, as we affirm, of necessity be created bya cause. But the father and maker of all this universe ispast finding out; and even if we found him, to tell ofhim to all men would be impossible. And there is still aquestion to be asked about him: Which of the patternshad the artificer in view when he made the world—thepattern of the unchangeable, or of that which is cre-ated? If the world be indeed fair and the artificer good,it is manifest that he must have looked to that which iseternal; but if what cannot be said without blasphemyis true, then to the created pattern. Every one will seethat he must have looked to the eternal; for the worldis the fairest of creations and he is the best of causes.And having been created in this way, the world hasbeen framed in the likeness of that which is appre-hended by reason and mind and is unchangeable, andmust therefore of necessity, if this is admitted, be acopy of something. Now it is all-important that thebeginning of everything should be according to nature.And in speaking of the copy and the original we mayassume that words are akin to the matter which theydescribe; when they relate to the lasting and perma-nent and intelligible, they ought to be lasting and un-alterable, and, as far as their nature allows, irrefutableand immovable—nothing less. But when they expressonly the copy or likeness and not the eternal thingsthemselves, they need only be likely and analogous tothe real words. As being is to becoming, so is truth tobelief. If then, Socrates, amid the many opinions aboutthe gods and the generation of the universe, we arenot able to give notions which are altogether and inevery respect exact and consistent with one another,do not be surprised. Enough, if we adduce probabilitiesas likely as any others; for we must remember that IPlato’s “Timaeus”16"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"who am the speaker, and you who are the judges, areonly mortal men, and we ought to accept the tale whichis probable and enquire no further.SOCRATES: Excellent, Timaeus; and we will do preciselyas you bid us. The prelude is charming, and is alreadyaccepted by us—may we beg of you to proceed to thestrain?TIMAEUS: Let me tell you then why the creator madethis world of generation. He was good, and the goodcan never have any jealousy of anything. And beingfree from jealousy, he desired that all things should beas like himself as they could be. This is in the truestsense the origin of creation and of the world, as weshall do well in believing on the testimony of wise men:God desired that all things should be good and nothingbad, so far as this was attainable. Wherefore also find-ing the whole visible sphere not at rest, but moving inan irregular and disorderly fashion, out of disorder hebrought order, considering that this was in every waybetter than the other. Now the deeds of the best couldnever be or have been other than the fairest; and thecreator, reflecting on the things which are by naturevisible, found that no unintelligent creature taken as awhole was fairer than the intelligent taken as a whole;and that intelligence could not be present in anythingwhich was devoid of soul. For which reason, when hewas framing the universe, he put intelligence in soul,and soul in body, that he might be the creator of awork which was by nature fairest and best. Wherefore,using the language of probability, we may say that theworld became a living creature truly endowed with souland intelligence by the providence of God.This being supposed, let us proceed to the next stage:In the likeness of what animal did the Creator make theworld? It would be an unworthy thing to liken it to anynature which exists as a part only; for nothing can bebeautiful which is like any imperfect thing; but let ussuppose the world to be the very image of that whole ofwhich all other animals both individually and in theirtribes are portions. For the original of the universe con-Plato’s “Timaeus”17"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"tains in itself all intelligible beings, just as this worldcomprehends us and all other visible creatures. For theDeity, intending to make this world like the fairest andmost perfect of intelligible beings, framed one visibleanimal comprehending within itself all other animals ofa kindred nature. Are we right in saying that there isone world, or that they are many and infinite? Theremust be one only, if the created copy is to accord withthe original. For that which includes all other intelli-gible creatures cannot have a second or companion; inthat case there would be need of another living beingwhich would include both, and of which they would beparts, and the likeness would be more truly said toresemble not them, but that other which included them.In order then that the world might be solitary, like theperfect animal, the creator made not two worlds or aninfinite number of them; but there is and ever will beone only-begotten and created heaven.Now that which is created is of necessity corporeal,and also visible and tangible. And nothing is visiblewhere there is no fire, or tangible which has no solid-ity, and nothing is solid without earth. Wherefore alsoGod in the beginning of creation made the body of theuniverse to consist of fire and earth. But two thingscannot be rightly put together without a third; theremust be some bond of union between them. And thefairest bond is that which makes the most completefusion of itself and the things which it combines; andproportion is best adapted to effect such a union. Forwhenever in any three numbers, whether cube or square,there is a mean, which is to the last term what the firstterm is to it; and again, when the mean is to the firstterm as the last term is to the mean—then the meanbecoming first and last, and the first and last bothbecoming means, they will all of them of necessity cometo be the same, and having become the same with oneanother will be all one. If the universal frame had beencreated a surface only and having no depth, a singlemean would have sufficed to bind together itself andthe other terms; but now, as the world must be solid,and solid bodies are always compacted not by one meanbut by two, God placed water and air in the mean be-Plato’s “Timaeus”18"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"tween fire and earth, and made them to have the sameproportion so far as was possible (as fire is to air so isair to water, and as air is to water so is water to earth);and thus he bound and put together a visible and tan-gible heaven. And for these reasons, and out of suchelements which are in number four, the body of theworld was created, and it was harmonized by propor-tion, and therefore has the spirit of friendship; andhaving been reconciled to itself, it was indissoluble bythe hand of any other than the framer.Now the creation took up the whole of each of thefour elements; for the Creator compounded the worldout of all the fire and all the water and all the air andall the earth, leaving no part of any of them nor anypower of them outside. His intention was, in the firstplace, that the animal should be as far as possible aperfect whole and of perfect parts: secondly, that itshould be one, leaving no remnants out of which an-other such world might be created: and also that itshould be free from old age and unaffected by disease.Considering that if heat and cold and other powerfulforces which unite bodies surround and attack themfrom without when they are unprepared, they decom-pose them, and by bringing diseases and old age uponthem, make them waste away—for this cause and onthese grounds he made the world one whole, havingevery part entire, and being therefore perfect and notliable to old age and disease. And he gave to the worldthe figure which was suitable and also natural. Now tothe animal which was to comprehend all animals, thatfigure was suitable which comprehends within itselfall other figures. Wherefore he made the world in theform of a globe, round as from a lathe, having itsextremes in every direction equidistant from the cen-tre, the most perfect and the most like itself of allfigures; for he considered that the like is infinitelyfairer than the unlike. This he finished off, makingthe surface smooth all round for many reasons; in thefirst place, because the living being had no need ofeyes when there was nothing remaining outside himto be seen; nor of ears when there was nothing to beheard; and there was no surrounding atmosphere toPlato’s “Timaeus”19"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"be breathed; nor would there have been any use oforgans by the help of which he might receive his foodor get rid of what he had already digested, since therewas nothing which went from him or came into him:for there was nothing beside him. Of design he wascreated thus, his own waste providing his own food,and all that he did or suffered taking place in and byhimself. For the Creator conceived that a being whichwas self-sufficient would be far more excellent thanone which lacked anything; and, as he had no need totake anything or defend himself against any one, theCreator did not think it necessary to bestow upon himhands: nor had he any need of feet, nor of the wholeapparatus of walking; but the movement suited to hisspherical form was assigned to him, being of all theseven that which is most appropriate to mind andintelligence; and he was made to move in the samemanner and on the same spot, within his own limitsrevolving in a circle. All the other six motions weretaken away from him, and he was made not to partakeof their deviations. And as this circular movementrequired no feet, the universe was created withoutlegs and without feet.Such was the whole plan of the eternal God aboutthe god that was to be, to whom for this reason hegave a body, smooth and even, having a surface inevery direction equidistant from the centre, a body en-tire and perfect, and formed out of perfect bodies. Andin the centre he put the soul, which he diffused through-out the body, making it also to be the exterior environ-ment of it; and he made the universe a circle moving ina circle, one and solitary, yet by reason of its excellenceable to converse with itself, and needing no other friend-ship or acquaintance. Having these purposes in view hecreated the world a blessed god.Now God did not make the soul after the body, al-though we are speaking of them in this order; for hav-ing brought them together he would never haveallowed that the elder should be ruled by the younger;but this is a random manner of speaking which wehave, because somehow we ourselves too are very muchunder the dominion of chance. Whereas he made thePlato’s “Timaeus”20"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"soul in origin and excellence prior to and older thanthe body, to be the ruler and mistress, of whom thebody was to be the subject. And he made her out of thefollowing elements and on this wise: Out of the indivis-ible and unchangeable, and also out of that which isdivisible and has to do with material bodies, he com-pounded a third and intermediate kind of essence, par-taking of the nature of the same and of the other, andthis compound he placed accordingly in a mean be-tween the indivisible, and the divisible and material. Hetook the three elements of the same, the other, and theessence, and mingled them into one form, compressingby force the reluctant and unsociable nature of theother into the same. When he had mingled them withthe essence and out of three made one, he again di-vided this whole into as many portions as was fitting,each portion being a compound of the same, the other,and the essence. And he proceeded to divide after thismanner:—First of all, he took away one part of thewhole (1), and then he separated a second part whichwas double the first (2), and then he took away a thirdpart which was half as much again as the second andthree times as much as the first (3), and then he took afourth part which was twice as much as the second (4),and a fifth part which was three times the third (9),and a sixth part which was eight times the first (8),and a seventh part which was twenty-seven times thefirst (27). After this he filled up the double intervals(i.e. between 1, 2, 4, 8) and the triple (i.e. between 1,3, 9, 27) cutting off yet other portions from the mix-ture and placing them in the intervals, so that in eachinterval there were two kinds of means, the one ex-ceeding and exceeded by equal parts of its extremes (asfor example 1, 4/3, 2, in which the mean 4/3 is one-third of 1 more than 1, and one-third of 2 less than 2),the other being that kind of mean which exceeds and isexceeded by an equal number (e.g. - over 1, 4/3, 3/2, -over 2, 8/3, 3, - over 4, 16/3, 6, - over 8: and - over1, 3/2, 2, - over 3, 9/2, 6, - over 9, 27/2, 18, - over27.).Where there were intervals of 3/2 and of 4/3 and of9/8, made by the connecting terms in the former in-Plato’s “Timaeus”21"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"tervals, he filled up all the intervals of 4/3 with theinterval of 9/8, leaving a fraction over; and the inter-val which this fraction expressed was in the ratio of256 to 243 (e.g. 243:256::81/64:4/3::243/128:2::81/32:8/3::243/64:4::81/16:16/3::242/32:8.).And thus the whole mixture out of which he cutthese portions was all exhausted by him. This entirecompound he divided lengthways into two parts, whichhe joined to one another at the centre like the letter X,and bent them into a circular form, connecting themwith themselves and each other at the point oppositeto their original meeting-point; and, comprehendingthem in a uniform revolution upon the same axis, hemade the one the outer and the other the inner circle.Now the motion of the outer circle he called the mo-tion of the same, and the motion of the inner circle themotion of the other or diverse. The motion of the samehe carried round by the side (i.e. of the rectangularfigure supposed to be inscribed in the circle of theSame.) to the right, and the motion of the diversediagonally (i.e. across the rectangular figure from cor-ner to corner.) to the left. And he gave dominion tothe motion of the same and like, for that he left singleand undivided; but the inner motion he divided in sixplaces and made seven unequal circles having their in-tervals in ratios of two and and three, three of each,and bade the orbits proceed in a direction opposite toone another; and three (Sun, Mercury, Venus) he madeto move with equal swiftness, and the remaining four(Moon, Saturn, Mars, Jupiter) to move with unequalswiftness to the three and to one another, but in dueproportion.Now when the Creator had framed the soul accordingto his will, he formed within her the corporeal uni-verse, and brought the two together, and united themcentre to centre. The soul, interfused everywhere fromthe centre to the circumference of heaven, of whichalso she is the external envelopment, herself turning inherself, began a divine beginning of never-ceasing andrational life enduring throughout all time. The body ofheaven is visible, but the soul is invisible, and partakesof reason and harmony, and being made by the best ofPlato’s “Timaeus”22"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"intellectual and everlasting natures, is the best of thingscreated. And because she is composed of the same andof the other and of the essence, these three, and isdivided and united in due proportion, and in her revo-lutions returns upon herself, the soul, whentouching anything which has essence, whether dispersedin parts or undivided, is stirred through all her powers,to declare the sameness or difference of that thing andsome other; and to what individuals are related, and bywhat affected, and in what way and how and when,both in the world of generation and in the world ofimmutable being. And when reason, which works withequal truth, whether she be in the circle of the diverseor of the same—in voiceless silence holding her onwardcourse in the sphere of the self-moved—when reason, Isay, is hovering around the sensible world and whenthe circle of the diverse also moving truly imparts theintimations of sense to the whole soul, then arise opin-ions and beliefs sure and certain. But when reason isconcerned with the rational, and the circle of the samemoving smoothly declares it, then intelligence andknowledge are necessarily perfected. And if any oneaffirms that in which these two are found to be otherthan the soul, he will say the very opposite of thetruth.When the father and creator saw the creature whichhe had made moving and living, the created image ofthe eternal gods, he rejoiced, and in his joy determinedto make the copy still more like the original; and as thiswas eternal, he sought to make the universe eternal, sofar as might be. Now the nature of the ideal being waseverlasting, but to bestow this attribute in its fulnessupon a creature was impossible. Wherefore he resolvedto have a moving image of eternity, and when he set inorder the heaven, he made this image eternal but mov-ing according to number, while eternity itself rests inunity; and this image we call time. For there were nodays and nights and months and years before the heavenwas created, but when he constructed the heaven hecreated them also. They are all parts of time, and thepast and future are created species of time, which weunconsciously but wrongly transfer to the eternal es-Plato’s “Timaeus”23"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"sence; for we say that he ‘was,’ he ‘is,’ he ‘will be,’ butthe truth is that ‘is’ alone is properly attributed to him,and that ‘was’ and ‘will be’ are only to be spoken ofbecoming in time, for they are motions, but that whichis immovably the same cannot become older or youngerby time, nor ever did or has become, or hereafter willbe, older or younger, nor is subject at all to any ofthose states which affect moving and sensible thingsand of which generation is the cause. These are theforms of time, which imitates eternity and revolves ac-cording to a law of number. Moreover, when we saythat what has become is become and what becomes isbecoming, and that what will become is about to be-come and that the non-existent is non-existent—allthese are inaccurate modes of expression (compareParmen.). But perhaps this whole subject will be moresuitably discussed on some other occasion.Time, then, and the heaven came into being at thesame instant in order that, having been created to-gether, if ever there was to be a dissolution of them,they might be dissolved together. It was framed afterthe pattern of the eternal nature, that it might re-semble this as far as was possible; for the pattern existsfrom eternity, and the created heaven has been, and is,and will be, in all time. Such was the mind and thoughtof God in the creation of time. The sun and moon andfive other stars, which are called the planets, were cre-ated by him in order to distinguish and preserve thenumbers of time; and when he had made their severalbodies, he placed them in the orbits in which the circleof the other was revolving,—in seven orbits seven stars.First, there was the moon in the orbit nearest the earth,and next the sun, in the second orbit above the earth;then came the morning star and the star sacred toHermes, moving in orbits which have an equal swift-ness with the sun, but in an opposite direction; andthis is the reason why the sun and Hermes and Luciferovertake and are overtaken by each other. To enumer-ate the places which he assigned to the other stars, andto give all the reasons why he assigned them, althougha secondary matter, would give more trouble than theprimary. These things at some future time, when wePlato’s “Timaeus”24"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"are at leisure, may have the consideration which theydeserve, but not at present.Now, when all the stars which were necessary to thecreation of time had attained a motion suitable to them,and had become living creatures having bodies fastenedby vital chains, and learnt their appointed task, mov-ing in the motion of the diverse, which is diagonal, andpasses through and is governed by the motion of thesame, they revolved, some in a larger and some in alesser orbit—those which had the lesser orbit revolvingfaster, and those which had the larger more slowly.Now by reason of the motion of the same, those whichrevolved fastest appeared to be overtaken by those whichmoved slower although they really overtook them; forthe motion of the same made them all turn in a spiral,and, because some went one way and some another,that which receded most slowly from the sphere of thesame, which was the swiftest, appeared to follow itmost nearly. That there might be some visible measureof their relative swiftness and slowness as they pro-ceeded in their eight courses, God lighted a fire, whichwe now call the sun, in the second from the earth ofthese orbits, that it might give light to the whole ofheaven, and that the animals, as many as nature in-tended, might participate in number, learning arith-metic from the revolution of the same and the like.Thus then, and for this reason the night and the daywere created, being the period of the one most intelli-gent revolution. And the month is accomplished whenthe moon has completed her orbit and overtaken thesun, and the year when the sun has completed his ownorbit. Mankind, with hardly an exception, have notremarked the periods of the other stars, and they haveno name for them, and do not measure them againstone another by the help of number, and hence theycan scarcely be said to know that their wanderings,being infinite in number and admirable for their vari-ety, make up time. And yet there is no difficulty inseeing that the perfect number of time fulfils the per-fect year when all the eight revolutions, having theirrelative degrees of swiftness, are accomplished togetherand attain their completion at the same time, measuredPlato’s “Timaeus”25"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"by the rotation of the same and equally moving. Afterthis manner, and for these reasons, came into beingsuch of the stars as in their heavenly progress receivedreversals of motion, to the end that the created heavenmight imitate the eternal nature, and be as like as pos-sible to the perfect and intelligible animal.Thus far and until the birth of time the created uni-verse was made in the likeness of the original, but inas-much as all animals were not yet comprehended therein,it was still unlike. What remained, the creator thenproceeded to fashion after the nature of the pattern.Now as in the ideal animal the mind perceives ideas orspecies of a certain nature and number, he thoughtthat this created animal ought to have species of a likenature and number. There are four such; one of themis the heavenly race of the gods; another, the race ofbirds whose way is in the air; the third, the wateryspecies; and the fourth, the pedestrian and land crea-tures. Of the heavenly and divine, he created the greaterpart out of fire, that they might be the brightest of allthings and fairest to behold, and he fashioned themafter the likeness of the universe in the figure of acircle, and made them follow the intelligent motion ofthe supreme, distributing them over the whole circum-ference of heaven, which was to be a true cosmos orglorious world spangled with them all over. And hegave to each of them two movements: the first, a move-ment on the same spot after the same manner, wherebythey ever continue to think consistently the samethoughts about the same things; the second, a forwardmovement, in which they are controlled by the revolu-tion of the same and the like; but by the other fivemotions they were unaffected, in order that each ofthem might attain the highest perfection. And for thisreason the fixed stars were created, to be divine andeternal animals, ever-abiding and revolving after thesame manner and on the same spot; and the other starswhich reverse their motion and are subject to devia-tions of this kind, were created in the manner alreadydescribed. The earth, which is our nurse, clinging (or‘circling’) around the pole which is extended throughthe universe, he framed to be the guardian and artificerPlato’s “Timaeus”26"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"of night and day, first and eldest of gods that are in theinterior of heaven. Vain would be the attempt to tell allthe figures of them circling as in dance, and their jux-tapositions, and the return of them in their revolu-tions upon themselves, and their approximations, andto say which of these deities in their conjunctions meet,and which of them are in opposition, and in what orderthey get behind and before one another, and whenthey are severally eclipsed to our sight and again reap-pear, sending terrors and intimations of the future tothose who cannot calculate their movements—to at-tempt to tell of all this without a visible representationof the heavenly system would be labour in vain. Enoughon this head; and now let what we have said about thenature of the created and visible gods have an end.To know or tell the origin of the other divinities isbeyond us, and we must accept the traditions of themen of old time who affirm themselves to be the off-spring of the gods—that is what they say—and theymust surely have known their own ancestors. How canwe doubt the word of the children of the gods? Al-though they give no probable or certain proofs, still, asthey declare that they are speaking of what took placein their own family, we must conform to custom andbelieve them. In this manner, then, according to them,the genealogy of these gods is to be received and setforth.Oceanus and Tethys were the children of Earth andHeaven, and from these sprang Phorcys and Cronos andRhea, and all that generation; and from Cronos andRhea sprang Zeus and Here, and all those who are saidto be their brethren, and others who were the childrenof these.Now, when all of them, both those who visibly ap-pear in their revolutions as well as those other godswho are of a more retiring nature, had come into be-ing, the creator of the universe addressed them in thesewords: ‘Gods, children of gods, who are my works, andof whom I am the artificer and father, my creations areindissoluble, if so I will. All that is bound may be un-done, but only an evil being would wish to undo thatwhich is harmonious and happy. Wherefore, since yePlato’s “Timaeus”27"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"are but creatures, ye are not altogether immortal andindissoluble, but ye shall certainly not be dissolved, norbe liable to the fate of death, having in my will a greaterand mightier bond than those with which ye were boundat the time of your birth. And now listen to my in-structions:—Three tribes of mortal beings remain to becreated—without them the universe will be incomplete,for it will not contain every kind of animal which itought to contain, if it is to be perfect. On the otherhand, if they were created by me and received life atmy hands, they would be on an equality with the gods.In order then that they may be mortal, and that thisuniverse may be truly universal, do ye, according toyour natures, betake yourselves to the formation ofanimals, imitating the power which was shown by mein creating you. The part of them worthy of the nameimmortal, which is called divine and is the guiding prin-ciple of those who are willing to follow justice andyou—of that divine part I will myself sow the seed, andhaving made a beginning, I will hand the work over toyou. And do ye then interweave the mortal with theimmortal, and make and beget living creatures, andgive them food, and make them to grow, and receivethem again in death.’Thus he spake, and once more into the cup in whichhe had previously mingled the soul of the universe hepoured the remains of the elements, and mingled themin much the same manner; they were not, however,pure as before, but diluted to the second and thirddegree. And having made it he divided the whole mix-ture into souls equal in number to the stars, and as-signed each soul to a star; and having there placedthem as in a chariot, he showed them the nature of theuniverse, and declared to them the laws of destiny,according to which their first birth would be one andthe same for all,—no one should suffer a disadvantageat his hands; they were to be sown in the instrumentsof time severally adapted to them, and to come forththe most religious of animals; and as human nature wasof two kinds, the superior race would hereafter be calledman. Now, when they should be implanted in bodies bynecessity, and be always gaining or losing some part ofPlato’s “Timaeus”28"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"their bodily substance, then in the first place it wouldbe necessary that they should all have in them one andthe same faculty of sensation, arising out of irresistibleimpressions; in the second place, they must have love,in which pleasure and pain mingle; also fear and anger,and the feelings which are akin or opposite to them; ifthey conquered these they would live righteously, andif they were conquered by them, unrighteously. Hewho lived well during his appointed time was to returnand dwell in his native star, and there he would have ablessed and congenial existence. But if he failed in at-taining this, at the second birth he would pass into awoman, and if, when in that state of being, he did notdesist from evil, he would continually be changed intosome brute who resembled him in the evil nature whichhe had acquired, and would not cease from his toils andtransformations until he followed the revolution of thesame and the like within him, and overcame by thehelp of reason the turbulent and irrational mob of lateraccretions, made up of fire and air and water and earth,and returned to the form of his first and better state.Having given all these laws to his creatures, that hemight be guiltless of future evil in any of them, thecreator sowed some of them in the earth, and some inthe moon, and some in the other instruments of time;and when he had sown them he committed to theyounger gods the fashioning of their mortal bodies,and desired them to furnish what was still lacking tothe human soul, and having made all the suitable addi-tions, to rule over them, and to pilot the mortal animalin the best and wisest manner which they could, andavert from him all but self-inflicted evils.When the creator had made all these ordinances heremained in his own accustomed nature, and his chil-dren heard and were obedient to their father’s word,and receiving from him the immortal principle of a mortalcreature, in imitation of their own creator they bor-rowed portions of fire, and earth, and water, and airfrom the world, which were hereafter to be restored—these they took and welded them together, not withthe indissoluble chains by which they were themselvesbound, but with little pegs too small to be visible, mak-Plato’s “Timaeus”29"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"ing up out of all the four elements each separate body,and fastening the courses of the immortal soul in abody which was in a state of perpetual influx and efflux.Now these courses, detained as in a vast river, neitherovercame nor were overcome; but were hurrying andhurried to and fro, so that the whole animal was movedand progressed, irregularly however and irrationally andanyhow, in all the six directions of motion, wanderingbackwards and forwards, and right and left, and up anddown, and in all the six directions. For great as was theadvancing and retiring flood which provided nourish-ment, the affections produced by external contactcaused still greater tumult—when the body of any onemet and came into collision with some external fire, orwith the solid earth or the gliding waters, or was caughtin the tempest borne on the air, and the motions pro-duced by any of these impulses were carried throughthe body to the soul. All such motions have conse-quently received the general name of ‘sensations,’ whichthey still retain. And they did in fact at that time cre-ate a very great and mighty movement; uniting withthe ever-flowing stream in stirring up and violentlyshaking the courses of the soul, they completely stoppedthe revolution of the same by their opposing current,and hindered it from predominating and advancing; andthey so disturbed the nature of the other or diverse,that the three double intervals (i.e. between 1, 2, 4,8), and the three triple intervals (i.e. between 1, 3, 9,27), together with the mean terms and connecting linkswhich are expressed by the ratios of 3:2, and 4:3, andof 9:8—these, although they cannot be wholly undoneexcept by him who united them, were twisted by themin all sorts of ways, and the circles were broken anddisordered in every possible manner, so that when theymoved they were tumbling to pieces, and moved irra-tionally, at one time in a reverse direction, and thenagain obliquely, and then upside down, as you mightimagine a person who is upside down and has his headleaning upon the ground and his feet up against some-thing in the air; and when he is in such a position,both he and the spectator fancy that the right of ei-ther is his left, and the left right. If, when powerfullyPlato’s “Timaeus”30"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"experiencing these and similar effects, the revolutionsof the soul come in contact with some external thing,either of the class of the same or of the other, theyspeak of the same or of the other in a manner the veryopposite of the truth; and they become false and fool-ish, and there is no course or revolution in them whichhas a guiding or directing power; and if again any sen-sations enter in violently from without and drag afterthem the whole vessel of the soul, then the courses ofthe soul, though they seem to conquer, are really con-quered.And by reason of all these affections, the soul, whenencased in a mortal body, now, as in the beginning, isat first without intelligence; but when the flood ofgrowth and nutriment abates, and the courses of thesoul, calming down, go their own way and becomesteadier as time goes on, then the several circles returnto their natural form, and their revolutions are cor-rected, and they call the same and the other by theirright names, and make the possessor of them to be-come a rational being. And if these combine in himwith any true nurture or education, he attains thefulness and health of the perfect man, and escapes theworst disease of all; but if he neglects education hewalks lame to the end of his life, and returns imperfectand good for nothing to the world below. This, how-ever, is a later stage; at present we must treat moreexactly the subject before us, which involves a prelimi-nary enquiry into the generation of the body and itsmembers, and as to how the soul was created—for whatreason and by what providence of the gods; and hold-ing fast to probability, we must pursue our way.First, then, the gods, imitating the spherical shape ofthe universe, enclosed the two divine courses in a spheri-cal body, that, namely, which we now term the head,being the most divine part of us and the lord of all thatis in us: to this the gods, when they put together thebody, gave all the other members to be servants, con-sidering that it partook of every sort of motion. Inorder then that it might not tumble about among thehigh and deep places of the earth, but might be able toget over the one and out of the other, they providedPlato’s “Timaeus”31"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"the body to be its vehicle and means of locomotion;which consequently had length and was furnished withfour limbs extended and flexible; these God contrivedto be instruments of locomotion with which it mighttake hold and find support, and so be able to passthrough all places, carrying on high the dwelling-placeof the most sacred and divine part of us. Such was theorigin of legs and hands, which for this reason wereattached to every man; and the gods, deeming the frontpart of man to be more honourable and more fit tocommand than the hinder part, made us to move mostlyin a forward direction. Wherefore man must needs havehis front part unlike and distinguished from the rest ofhis body.And so in the vessel of the head, they first of all puta face in which they inserted organs to minister in allthings to the providence of the soul, and they ap-pointed this part, which has authority, to be by naturethe part which is in front. And of the organs they firstcontrived the eyes to give light, and the principle ac-cording to which they were inserted was as follows: Somuch of fire as would not burn, but gave a gentlelight, they formed into a substance akin to the light ofevery-day life; and the pure fire which is within us andrelated thereto they made to flow through the eyes ina stream smooth and dense, compressing the whole eye,and especially the centre part, so that it kept out ev-erything of a coarser nature, and allowed to pass onlythis pure element. When the light of day surrounds thestream of vision, then like falls upon like, and theycoalesce, and one body is formed by natural affinity inthe line of vision, wherever the light that falls fromwithin meets with an external object. And the wholestream of vision, being similarly affected in virtue ofsimilarity, diffuses the motions of what it touches orwhat touches it over the whole body, until they reachthe soul, causing that perception which we call sight.But when night comes on and the external and kindredfire departs, then the stream of vision is cut off; forgoing forth to an unlike element it is changed andextinguished, being no longer of one nature with thesurrounding atmosphere which is now deprived of fire:Plato’s “Timaeus”32"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"and so the eye no longer sees, and we feel disposed tosleep. For when the eyelids, which the gods inventedfor the preservation of sight, are closed, they keep inthe internal fire; and the power of the fire diffuses andequalizes the inward motions; when they are equalized,there is rest, and when the rest is profound, sleep comesover us scarce disturbed by dreams; but where thegreater motions still remain, of whatever nature and inwhatever locality, they engender corresponding visionsin dreams, which are remembered by uswhen we are awake and in the external world. And nowthere is no longer any difficulty in understanding thecreation of images in mirrors and all smooth and brightsurfaces. For from the communion of the internal andexternal fires, and again from the union of them andtheir numerous transformations when they meet in themirror, all these appearances of necessity arise, whenthe fire from the face coalesces with the fire from theeye on the bright and smooth surface. And right ap-pears left and left right, because the visual rays comeinto contact with the rays emitted by the object in amanner contrary to the usual mode of meeting; butthe right appears right, and the left left, when theposition of one of the two concurring lights is reversed;and this happens when the mirror is concave and itssmooth surface repels the right stream of vision to theleft side, and the left to the right (He is speaking of twokinds of mirrors, first the plane, secondly the concave;and the latter is supposed to be placed, first horizon-tally, and then vertically.). Or if the mirror be turnedvertically, then the concavity makes the countenanceappear to be all upside down, and the lower rays aredriven upwards and the upper downwards.All these are to be reckoned among the second andco-operative causes which God, carrying into execu-tion the idea of the best as far as possible, uses as hisministers. They are thought by most men not to be thesecond, but the prime causes of all things, becausethey freeze and heat, and contract and dilate, and thelike. But they are not so, for they are incapable ofreason or intellect; the only being which can properlyhave mind is the invisible soul, whereas fire and water,Plato’s “Timaeus”33"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"and earth and air, are all of them visible bodies. Thelover of intellect and knowledge ought to explore causesof intelligent nature first of all, and, secondly, of thosethings which, being moved by others, are compelled tomove others. And this is what we too must do. Bothkinds of causes should be acknowledged by us, but adistinction should be made between those which areendowed with mind and are the workers of things fairand good, and those which are deprived of intelligenceand always produce chance effects without order ordesign. Of the second or co-operative causes of sight,which help to give to the eyes the power which theynow possess, enough has been said. I will thereforenow proceed to speak of the higher use and purpose forwhich God has given them to us. The sight in my opin-ion is the source of the greatest benefit to us, for hadwe never seen the stars, and the sun, and the heaven,none of the words which we have spoken about theuniverse would ever have been uttered. But now thesight of day and night, and the months and the revolu-tions of the years, have created number, and have givenus a conception of time, and the power of enquiringabout the nature of the universe; and from this sourcewe have derived philosophy, than which no greater goodever was or will be given by the gods to mortal man.This is the greatest boon of sight: and of the lesserbenefits why should I speak? even the ordinary man ifhe were deprived of them would bewail his loss, but invain. Thus much let me say however: God invented andgave us sight to the end that we might behold thecourses of intelligence in the heaven, and apply themto the courses of our own intelligence which are akinto them, the unperturbed to the perturbed; and thatwe, learning them and partaking of the natural truthof reason, might imitate the absolutely unerring coursesof God and regulate our own vagaries. The same may beaffirmed of speech and hearing: they have been givenby the gods to the same end and for a like reason. Forthis is the principal end of speech, whereto it mostcontributes. Moreover, so much of music as is adaptedto the sound of the voice and to the sense of hearing isgranted to us for the sake of harmony; and harmony,Plato’s “Timaeus”34"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"which has motions akin to the revolutions of our souls,is not regarded by the intelligent votary of the Musesas given by them with a view to irrational pleasure,which is deemed to be the purpose of it in our day, butas meant to correct any discord which may have arisenin the courses of the soul, and to be our ally in bring-ing her into harmony and agreement with herself; andrhythm too was given by them for the same reason, onaccount of the irregular and graceless ways which pre-vail among mankind generally, and to help us againstthem.Thus far in what we have been saying, with smallexception, the works of intelligence have been set forth;and now we must place by the side of them in ourdiscourse the things which come into being throughnecessity—for the creation is mixed, being made up ofnecessity and mind. Mind, the ruling power, persuadednecessity to bring the greater part of created things toperfection, and thus and after this manner in the be-ginning, when the influence of reason got the better ofnecessity, the universe was created. But if a person willtruly tell of the way in which the work was accom-plished, he must include the other influence of thevariable cause as well. Wherefore, we must return againand find another suitable beginning, as about the formermatters, so also about these. To which end we mustconsider the nature of fire, and water, and air, andearth, such as they were prior to the creation of theheaven, and what was happening to them in this previ-ous state; for no one has as yet explained the mannerof their generation, but we speak of fire and the rest ofthem, whatever they mean, as though men knew theirnatures, and we maintain them to be the first prin-ciples and letters or elements of the whole, when theycannot reasonably be compared by a man of any senseeven to syllables or first compounds. And let me saythus much: I will not now speak of the first principle orprinciples of all things, or by whatever name they areto be called, for this reason—because it is difficult toset forth my opinion according to the method of dis-cussion which we are at present employing. Do notimagine, any more than I can bring myself to imagine,Plato’s “Timaeus”35"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"that I should be right in undertaking so great and diffi-cult a task. Remembering what I said at first aboutprobability, I will do my best to give as probable anexplanation as any other—or rather, more probable;and I will first go back to the beginning and try tospeak of each thing and of all. Once more, then, at thecommencement of my discourse, I call upon God, andbeg him to be our saviour out of a strange and un-wonted enquiry, and to bring us to the haven of prob-ability. So now let us begin again.This new beginning of our discussion of the universerequires a fuller division than the former; for then wemade two classes, now a third must be revealed. Thetwo sufficed for the former discussion: one, which weassumed, was a pattern intelligible and always the same;and the second was only the imitation of the pattern,generated and visible. There is also a third kind whichwe did not distinguish at the time, conceiving that thetwo would be enough. But now the argument seems torequire that we should set forth in words another kind,which is difficult of explanation and dimly seen. Whatnature are we to attribute to this new kind of being?We reply, that it is the receptacle, and in a manner thenurse, of all generation. I have spoken the truth; but Imust express myself in clearer language, and this willbe an arduous task for many reasons, and in particularbecause I must first raise questions concerning fire andthe other elements, and determine what each of themis; for to say, with any probability or certitude, whichof them should be called water rather than fire, andwhich should be called any of them rather than all orsome one of them, is a difficult matter. How, then,shall we settle this point, and what questions aboutthe elements may be fairly raised?In the first place, we see that what we just nowcalled water, by condensation, I suppose, becomes stoneand earth; and this same element, when melted anddispersed, passes into vapour and air. Air, again, wheninflamed, becomes fire; and again fire, when condensedand extinguished, passes once more into the form ofair; and once more, air, when collected and condensed,produces cloud and mist; and from these, when stillPlato’s “Timaeus”36"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"more compressed, comes flowing water, and from watercomes earth and stones once more; and thus genera-tion appears to be transmitted from one to the other ina circle. Thus, then, as the several elements neverpresent themselves in the same form, how can any onehave the assurance to assert positively that any of them,whatever it may be, is one thing rather than another?No one can. But much the safest plan is to speak ofthem as follows:—Anything which we see to be con-tinually changing, as, for example, fire, we must notcall ‘this’ or ‘that,’ but rather say that it is ‘of such anature’; nor let us speak of water as ‘this’; but alwaysas ‘such’; nor must we imply that there is any stabilityin any of those things which we indicate by the use ofthe words ‘this’ and ‘that,’ supposing ourselves to sig-nify something thereby; for they are too volatile to bedetained in any such expressions as ‘this,’ or ‘that,’ or‘relative to this,’ or any other mode of speaking whichrepresents them as permanent. We ought not to apply‘this’ to any of them, but rather the word ‘such’; whichexpresses the similar principle circulating in each andall of them; for example, that should be called ‘fire’which is of such a nature always, and so of everythingthat has generation. That in which the elements sever-ally grow up, and appear, and decay, is alone to becalled by the name ‘this’ or ‘that’; but that which is of acertain nature, hot or white, or anything which admitsof opposite qualities, and all things that are compoundedof them, ought not to be so denominated. Let me makeanother attempt to explain my meaning more clearly.Suppose a person to make all kinds of figures of goldand to be always transmuting one form into all therest;—somebody points to one of them and asks whatit is. By far the safest and truest answer is, That isgold; and not to call the triangle or any other figureswhich are formed in the gold ‘these,’ as though theyhad existence, since they are in process of change whilehe is making the assertion; but if the questioner bewilling to take the safe and indefinite expression, ‘such,’we should be satisfied. And the same argument appliesto the universal nature which receives all bodies—thatmust be always called the same; for, while receiving allPlato’s “Timaeus”37"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"things, she never departs at all from her own nature,and never in any way, or at any time, assumes a formlike that of any of the things which enter into her; sheis the natural recipient of all impressions, and is stirredand informed by them, and appears different from timeto time by reason of them. But the forms which enterinto and go out of her are the likenesses of real exist-ences modelled after their patterns in a wonderful andinexplicable manner, which we will hereafter investi-gate. For the present we have only to conceive of threenatures: first, that which is in process of generation;secondly, that in which the generation takes place; andthirdly, that of which the thing generated is a resem-blance. And we may liken the receiving principle to amother, and the source or spring to a father, and theintermediate nature to a child; and may remark fur-ther, that if the model is to take every variety of form,then the matter in which the model is fashioned willnot be duly prepared, unless it is formless, and freefrom the impress of any of those shapes which it ishereafter to receive from without. For if the matterwere like any of the supervening forms, then wheneverany opposite or entirely different nature was stampedupon its surface, it would take the impression badly,because it would intrude its own shape. Wherefore, thatwhich is to receive all forms should have no form; as inmaking perfumes they first contrive that the liquid sub-stance which is to receive the scent shall be as inodorousas possible; or as those who wish to impress figures onsoft substances do not allow any previous impression toremain, but begin by making the surface as even andsmooth as possible. In the same way that which is toreceive perpetually and through its whole extent theresemblances of all eternal beings ought to be devoid ofany particular form. Wherefore, the mother and recep-tacle of all created and visible and in any way sensiblethings, is not to be termed earth, or air, or fire, orwater, or any of their compounds or any of the ele-ments from which these are derived, but is an invisibleand formless being which receives all things and insome mysterious way partakes of the intelligible, and ismost incomprehensible. In saying this we shall not bePlato’s “Timaeus”38"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"far wrong; as far, however, as we can attain to a knowl-edge of her from the previous considerations, we maytruly say that fire is that part of her nature which fromtime to time is inflamed, and water that which is moist-ened, and that the mother substance becomes earthand air, in so far as she receives the impressions ofthem.Let us consider this question more precisely. Is thereany self-existent fire? and do all those things which wecall self-existent exist? or are only those things whichwe see, or in some way perceive through the bodilyorgans, truly existent, and nothing whatever besidesthem? And is all that which we call an intelligible es-sence nothing at all, and only a name? Here is a ques-tion which we must not leave unexamined or undeter-mined, nor must we affirm too confidently that therecan be no decision; neither must we interpolate in ourpresent long discourse a digression equally long, but ifit is possible to set forth a great principle in a fewwords, that is just what we want.Thus I state my view:—If mind and true opinion aretwo distinct classes, then I say that there certainly arethese self-existent ideas unperceived by sense, and ap-prehended only by the mind; if, however, as some say,true opinion differs in no respect from mind, then ev-erything that we perceive through the body is to beregarded as most real and certain. But we must affirmthem to be distinct, for they have a distinct origin andare of a different nature; the one is implanted in us byinstruction, the other by persuasion; the one is alwaysaccompanied by true reason, the other is without rea-son; the one cannot be overcome by persuasion, butthe other can: and lastly, every man may be said toshare in true opinion, but mind is the attribute of thegods and of very few men. Wherefore also we mustacknowledge that there is one kind of being which isalways the same, uncreated and indestructible, neverreceiving anything into itself from without, nor itselfgoing out to any other, but invisible and imperceptibleby any sense, and of which the contemplation is grantedto intelligence only. And there is another nature of thesame name with it, and like to it, perceived by sense,Plato’s “Timaeus”39"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"created, always in motion, becoming in place and againvanishing out of place, which is apprehended by opin-ion and sense. And there is a third nature, which isspace, and is eternal, and admits not of destruction andprovides a home for all created things, and is appre-hended without the help of sense, by a kind of spuriousreason, and is hardly real; which we beholding as in adream, say of all existence that it must of necessity bein some place and occupy a space, but that what isneither in heaven nor in earth has no existence. Ofthese and other things of the same kind, relating tothe true and waking reality of nature, we have onlythis dreamlike sense, and we are unable to cast off sleepand determine the truth about them. For an image,since the reality, after which it is modelled, does notbelong to it, and it exists ever as the fleeting shadow ofsome other, must be inferred to be in another (i.e. inspace), grasping existence in some way or other, or itcould not be at all. But true and exact reason, vindi-cating the nature of true being, maintains that whiletwo things (i.e. the image and space) are different theycannot exist one of them in the other and so be oneand also two at the same time.Thus have I concisely given the result of my thoughts;and my verdict is that being and space and generation,these three, existed in their three ways before theheaven; and that the nurse of generation, moistenedby water and inflamed by fire, and receiving the formsof earth and air, and experiencing all the affectionswhich accompany these, presented a strange variety ofappearances; and being full of powers which were nei-ther similar nor equally balanced, was never in any partin a state of equipoise, but swaying unevenly hitherand thither, was shaken by them, and by its motionagain shook them; and the elements when moved wereseparated and carried continually, some one way, someanother; as, when grain is shaken and winnowed byfans and other instruments used in the threshing ofcorn, the close and heavy particles are borne away andsettle in one direction, and the loose and light particlesin another. In this manner, the four kinds or elementswere then shaken by the receiving vessel, which, mov-Plato’s “Timaeus”40"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"ing like a winnowing machine, scattered far away fromone another the elements most unlike, and forced themost similar elements into close contact. Wherefore alsothe various elements had different places before theywere arranged so as to form the universe. At first, theywere all without reason and measure. But when theworld began to get into order, fire and water and earthand air had only certain faint traces of themselves, andwere altogether such as everything might be expectedto be in the absence of God; this, I say, was their na-ture at that time, and God fashioned them by form andnumber. Let it be consistently maintained by us in allthat we say that God made them as far as possible thefairest and best, out of things which were not fair andgood. And now I will endeavour to show you the dispo-sition and generation of them by an unaccustomed ar-gument, which I am compelled to use; but I believethat you will be able to follow me, for your educationhas made you familiar with the methods of science.In the first place, then, as is evident to all, fire andearth and water and air are bodies. And every sort ofbody possesses solidity, and every solid must necessar-ily be contained in planes; and every plane rectilinearfigure is composed of triangles; and all triangles areoriginally of two kinds, both of which are made up ofone right and two acute angles; one of them has ateither end of the base the half of a divided right angle,having equal sides, while in the other the right angle isdivided into unequal parts, having unequal sides. These,then, proceeding by a combination of probability withdemonstration, we assume to be the original elementsof fire and the other bodies; but the principles whichare prior to these God only knows, and he of men whois the friend of God. And next we have to determinewhat are the four most beautiful bodies which are un-like one another, and of which some are capable ofresolution into one another; for having discovered thusmuch, we shall know the true origin of earth and fireand of the proportionate and intermediate elements.And then we shall not be willing to allow that there areany distinct kinds of visible bodies fairer than these.Wherefore we must endeavour to construct the fourPlato’s “Timaeus”41"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"forms of bodies which excel in beauty, and then weshall be able to say that we have sufficiently appre-hended their nature. Now of the two triangles, theisosceles has one form only; the scalene or unequal-sided has an infinite number. Of the infinite forms wemust select the most beautiful, if we are to proceed indue order, and any one who can point out a more beau-tiful form than ours for the construction of these bod-ies, shall carry off the palm, not as an enemy, but as afriend. Now, the one which we maintain to be the mostbeautiful of all the many triangles (and we need notspeak of the others) is that of which the double forms athird triangle which is equilateral; the reason of thiswould be long to tell; he who disproves what we aresaying, and shows that we are mistaken, may claim afriendly victory. Then let us choose two triangles, outof which fire and the other elements have been con-structed, one isosceles, the other having the square ofthe longer side equal to three times the square of thelesser side.Now is the time to explain what was before obscurelysaid: there was an error in imagining that all the fourelements might be generated by and into one another;this, I say, was an erroneous supposition, for there aregenerated from the triangles which we have selectedfour kinds—three from the one which has the sidesunequal; the fourth alone is framed out of the isoscelestriangle. Hence they cannot all be resolved into oneanother, a great number of small bodies being com-bined into a few large ones, or the converse. But threeof them can be thus resolved and compounded, forthey all spring from one, and when the greater bodiesare broken up, many small bodies will spring up out ofthem and take their own proper figures; or, again, whenmany small bodies are dissolved into their triangles, ifthey become one, they will form one large mass of an-other kind. So much for their passage into one an-other. I have now to speak of their several kinds, andshow out of what combinations of numbers each ofthem was formed. The first will be the simplest andsmallest construction, and its element is that trianglewhich has its hypotenuse twice the lesser side. WhenPlato’s “Timaeus”42"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"two such triangles are joined at the diagonal, and thisis repeated three times, and the triangles rest theirdiagonals and shorter sides on the same point as a cen-tre, a single equilateral triangle is formed out of sixtriangles; and four equilateral triangles, if put together,make out of every three plane angles one solid angle,being that which is nearest to the most obtuse of planeangles; and out of the combination of these four anglesarises the first solid form which distributes into equaland similar parts the whole circle in which it is in-scribed. The second species of solid is formed out of thesame triangles, which unite as eight equilateral trianglesand form one solid angle out of four plane angles, andout of six such angles the second body is completed.And the third body is made up of 120 triangular ele-ments, forming twelve solid angles, each of them in-cluded in five plane equilateral triangles, having alto-gether twenty bases, each of which is an equilateraltriangle. The one element (that is, the triangle whichhas its hypotenuse twice the lesser side) having gener-ated these figures, generated no more; but the isosce-les triangle produced the fourth elementary figure,which is compounded of four such triangles, joiningtheir right angles in a centre, and forming one equilat-eral quadrangle. Six of these united form eight solidangles, each of which is made by the combination ofthree plane right angles; the figure of the body thuscomposed is a cube, having six plane quadrangular equi-lateral bases. There was yet a fifth combination whichGod used in the delineation of the universe.Now, he who, duly reflecting on all this, enquireswhether the worlds are to be regarded as indefinite ordefinite in number, will be of opinion that the notion oftheir indefiniteness is characteristic of a sadly indefiniteand ignorant mind. He, however, who raises the ques-tion whether they are to be truly regarded as one orfive, takes up a more reasonable position. Arguing fromprobabilities, I am of opinion that they are one; another,regarding the question from another point of view, willbe of another mind. But, leaving this enquiry, let usproceed to distribute the elementary forms, which havenow been created in idea, among the four elements.Plato’s “Timaeus”43"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"To earth, then, let us assign the cubical form; forearth is the most immoveable of the four and the mostplastic of all bodies, and that which has the most stablebases must of necessity be of such a nature. Now, ofthe triangles which we assumed at first, that which hastwo equal sides is by nature more firmly based thanthat which has unequal sides; and of the compoundfigures which are formed out of either, the plane equi-lateral quadrangle has necessarily a more stable basisthan the equilateral triangle, both in the whole and inthe parts. Wherefore, in assigning this figure to earth,we adhere to probability; and to water we assign thatone of the remaining forms which is the least move-able; and the most moveable of them to fire; and to airthat which is intermediate. Also we assign the smallestbody to fire, and the greatest to water, and the inter-mediate in size to air; and, again, the acutest body tofire, and the next in acuteness to, air, and the third towater. Of all these elements, that which has the fewestbases must necessarily be the most moveable, for itmust be the acutest and most penetrating in everyway, and also the lightest as being composed of thesmallest number of similar particles: and the secondbody has similar properties in a second degree, and thethird body in the third degree. Let it be agreed, then,both according to strict reason and according to prob-ability, that the pyramid is the solid which is the origi-nal element and seed of fire; and let us assign the ele-ment which was next in the order of generation to air,and the third to water. We must imagine all these to beso small that no single particle of any of the four kindsis seen by us on account of their smallness: but whenmany of them are collected together their aggregatesare seen. And the ratios of their numbers, motions,and other properties, everywhere God, as far as neces-sity allowed or gave consent, has exactly perfected,and harmonized in due proportion.From all that we have just been saying about theelements or kinds, the most probable conclusion is asfollows:—earth, when meeting with fire and dissolvedby its sharpness, whether the dissolution take place inthe fire itself or perhaps in some mass of air or water, isPlato’s “Timaeus”44"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"borne hither and thither, until its parts, meeting to-gether and mutually harmonising, again become earth;for they can never take any other form. But water,when divided by fire or by air, on re-forming, maybecome one part fire and two parts air; and a singlevolume of air divided becomes two of fire. Again, whena small body of fire is contained in a larger body of airor water or earth, and both are moving, and the firestruggling is overcome and broken up, then two vol-umes of fire form one volume of air; and when air isovercome and cut up into small pieces, two and a halfparts of air are condensed into one part of water. Let usconsider the matter in another way. When one of theother elements is fastened upon by fire, and is cut bythe sharpness of its angles and sides, it coalesces withthe fire, and then ceases to be cut by them any longer.For no element which is one and the same with itselfcan be changed by or change another of the same kindand in the same state. But so long as in the process oftransition the weaker is fighting against the stronger,the dissolution continues. Again, when a few small par-ticles, enclosed in many larger ones, are in process ofdecomposition and extinction, they only cease fromtheir tendency to extinction when they consent to passinto the conquering nature, and fire becomes air andair water. But if bodies of another kind go and attackthem (i.e. the small particles), the latter continue to bedissolved until, being completely forced back and dis-persed, they make their escape to their own kindred, orelse, being overcome and assimilated to the conqueringpower, they remain where they are and dwell with theirvictors, and from being many become one. And owingto these affections, all things are changing their place,for by the motion of the receiving vessel the bulk ofeach class is distributed into its proper place; but thosethings which become unlike themselves and like otherthings, are hurried by the shaking into the place of thethings to which they grow like.Now all unmixed and primary bodies are produced bysuch causes as these. As to the subordinate specieswhich are included in the greater kinds, they are to beattributed to the varieties in the structure of the twoPlato’s “Timaeus”45"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"original triangles. For either structure did not origi-nally produce the triangle of one size only, but somelarger and some smaller, and there are as many sizes asthere are species of the four elements. Hence whenthey are mingled with themselves and with one an-other there is an endless variety of them, which thosewho would arrive at the probable truth of nature oughtduly to consider.Unless a person comes to an understanding aboutthe nature and conditions of rest and motion, he willmeet with many difficulties in the discussion whichfollows. Something has been said of this matter already,and something more remains to be said, which is, thatmotion never exists in what is uniform. For to conceivethat anything can be moved without a mover is hard orindeed impossible, and equally impossible to conceivethat there can be a mover unless there be somethingwhich can be moved—motion cannot exist where ei-ther of these are wanting, and for these to be uniformis impossible; wherefore we must assign rest to unifor-mity and motion to the want of uniformity. Now in-equality is the cause of the nature which is wanting inuniformity; and of this we have already described theorigin. But there still remains the further point—whythings when divided after their kinds do not cease topass through one another and to change their place—which we will now proceed to explain. In the revolu-tion of the universe are comprehended all the four ele-ments, and this being circular and having a tendencyto come together, compresses everything and will notallow any place to be left void. Wherefore, also, fireabove all things penetrates everywhere, and air next,as being next in rarity of the elements; and the twoother elements in like manner penetrate according totheir degrees of rarity. For those things which are com-posed of the largest particles have the largest void leftin their compositions, and those which are composedof the smallest particles have the least. And the con-traction caused by the compression thrusts the smallerparticles into the interstices of the larger. And thus,when the small parts are placed side by side with thelarger, and the lesser divide the greater and the greaterPlato’s “Timaeus”46"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"unite the lesser, all the elements are borne up and downand hither and thither towards their own places; forthe change in the size of each changes its position inspace. And these causes generate an inequality which isalways maintained, and is continually creating a per-petual motion of the elements in all time.In the next place we have to consider that there aredivers kinds of fire. There are, for example, first, flame;and secondly, those emanations of flame which do notburn but only give light to the eyes; thirdly, the re-mains of fire, which are seen in red-hot embers afterthe flame has been extinguished. There are similar dif-ferences in the air; of which the brightest part is calledthe aether, and the most turbid sort mist and darkness;and there are various other nameless kinds which arisefrom the inequality of the triangles. Water, again, ad-mits in the first place of a division into two kinds; theone liquid and the other fusile. The liquid kind is com-posed of the small and unequal particles of water; andmoves itself and is moved by other bodies owing to thewant of uniformity and the shape of its particles; whereasthe fusile kind, being formed of large and uniform par-ticles, is more stable than the other, and is heavy andcompact by reason of its uniformity. But when fire getsin and dissolves the particles and destroys the unifor-mity, it has greater mobility, and becoming fluid is thrustforth by the neighbouring air and spreads upon theearth; and this dissolution of the solid masses is calledmelting, and their spreading out upon the earth flow-ing. Again, when the fire goes out of the fusile sub-stance, it does not pass into a vacuum, but into theneighbouring air; and the air which is displaced forcestogether the liquid and still moveable mass into theplace which was occupied by the fire, and unites it withitself. Thus compressed the mass resumes its equability,and is again at unity with itself, because the fire whichwas the author of the inequality has retreated; and thisdeparture of the fire is called cooling, and the comingtogether which follows upon it is termed congealment.Of all the kinds termed fusile, that which is the densestand is formed out of the finest and most uniform partsis that most precious possession called gold, which isPlato’s “Timaeus”47"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"hardened by filtration through rock; this is unique inkind, and has both a glittering and a yellow colour. Ashoot of gold, which is so dense as to be very hard, andtakes a black colour, is termed adamant. There is alsoanother kind which has parts nearly like gold, and ofwhich there are several species; it is denser than gold,and it contains a small and fine portion of earth, and istherefore harder, yet also lighter because of the greatinterstices which it has within itself; and this substance,which is one of the bright and denser kinds of water,when solidified is called copper. There is an alloy ofearth mingled with it, which, when the two parts growold and are disunited, shows itself separately and iscalled rust. The remaining phenomena of the same kindthere will be no difficulty in reasoning out by the methodof probabilities. A man may sometimes set aside medita-tions about eternal things, and for recreation turn toconsider the truths of generation which are probableonly; he will thus gain a pleasure not to be repented of,and secure for himself while he lives a wise and moder-ate pastime. Let us grant ourselves this indulgence, andgo through the probabilities relating to the same sub-jects which follow next in order.Water which is mingled with fire, so much as is fineand liquid (being so called by reason of its motion andthe way in which it rolls along the ground), and soft,because its bases give way and are less stable than thoseof earth, when separated from fire and air and isolated,becomes more uniform, and by their retirement is com-pressed into itself; and if the condensation be very great,the water above the earth becomes hail, but on theearth, ice; and that which is congealed in a less degreeand is only half solid, when above the earth is calledsnow, and when upon the earth, and condensed fromdew, hoar-frost. Then, again, there are the numerouskinds of water which have been mingled with one an-other, and are distilled through plants which grow inthe earth; and this whole class is called by the name ofjuices or saps. The unequal admixture of these fluidscreates a variety of species; most of them are nameless,but four which are of a fiery nature are clearly distin-guished and have names. First, there is wine, whichPlato’s “Timaeus”48"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"warms the soul as well as the body: secondly, there isthe oily nature, which is smooth and divides the visualray, and for this reason is bright and shining and of aglistening appearance, including pitch, the juice of thecastor berry, oil itself, and other things of a like kind:thirdly, there is the class of substances which expandthe contracted parts of the mouth, until they returnto their natural state, and by reason of this propertycreate sweetness;—these are included under the gen-eral name of honey: and, lastly, there is a frothy na-ture, which differs from all juices, having a burningquality which dissolves the flesh; it is called opos (avegetable acid).As to the kinds of earth, that which is filtered throughwater passes into stone in the following manner:—Thewater which mixes with the earth and is broken up inthe process changes into air, and taking this formmounts into its own place. But as there is no surround-ing vacuum it thrusts away the neighbouring air, andthis being rendered heavy, and, when it is displaced,having been poured around the mass of earth, forciblycompresses it and drives it into the vacant space whencethe new air had come up; and the earth when com-pressed by the air into an indissoluble union with wa-ter becomes rock. The fairer sort is that which is madeup of equal and similar parts and is transparent; thatwhich has the opposite qualities is inferior. But whenall the watery part is suddenly drawn out by fire, amore brittle substance is formed, to which we give thename of pottery. Sometimes also moisture may remain,and the earth which has been fused by fire becomes,when cool, a certain stone of a black colour. A likeseparation of the water which had been copiouslymingled with them may occur in two substances com-posed of finer particles of earth and of a briny nature;out of either of them a half solid-body is then formed,soluble in water—the one, soda, which is used for purg-ing away oil and earth, the other, salt, which harmo-nizes so well in combinations pleasing to the palate,and is, as the law testifies, a substance dear to thegods. The compounds of earth and water are not solubleby water, but by fire only, and for this reason:—Nei-Plato’s “Timaeus”49"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"ther fire nor air melt masses of earth; for their par-ticles, being smaller than the interstices in its struc-ture, have plenty of room to move without forcingtheir way, and so they leave the earth unmelted andundissolved; but particles of water, which are larger,force a passage, and dissolve and melt the earth. Where-fore earth when not consolidated by force is dissolvedby water only; when consolidated, by nothing but fire;for this is the only body which can find an entrance.The cohesion of water again, when very strong, is dis-solved by fire only—when weaker, then either by air orfire—the former entering the interstices, and the lat-ter penetrating even the triangles. But nothing candissolve air, when strongly condensed, which does notreach the elements or triangles; or if not strongly con-densed, then only fire can dissolve it. As to bodiescomposed of earth and water, while the water occupiesthe vacant interstices of the earth in them which arecompressed by force, the particles of water which ap-proach them from without, finding no entrance, flowaround the entire mass and leave it undissolved; butthe particles of fire, entering into the interstices of thewater, do to the water what water does to earth andfire to air (The text seems to be corrupt.), and are thesole causes of the compound body of earth and waterliquefying and becoming fluid. Now these bodies are oftwo kinds; some of them, such as glass and the fusiblesort of stones, have less water than they have earth;on the other hand, substances of the nature of waxand incense have more of water entering into theircomposition.I have thus shown the various classes of bodies asthey are diversified by their forms and combinationsand changes into one another, and now I must endeav-our to set forth their affections and the causes of them.In the first place, the bodies which I have been describ-ing are necessarily objects of sense. But we have notyet considered the origin of flesh, or what belongs toflesh, or of that part of the soul which is mortal. Andthese things cannot be adequately explained withoutalso explaining the affections which are concerned withsensation, nor the latter without the former: and yetPlato’s “Timaeus”50"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"to explain them together is hardly possible; for whichreason we must assume first one or the other and af-terwards examine the nature of our hypothesis. In or-der, then, that the affections may follow regularly afterthe elements, let us presuppose the existence of bodyand soul.First, let us enquire what we mean by saying thatfire is hot; and about this we may reason from thedividing or cutting power which it exercises on ourbodies. We all of us feel that fire is sharp; and we mayfurther consider the fineness of the sides, and the sharp-ness of the angles, and the smallness of the particles,and the swiftness of the motion—all this makes theaction of fire violent and sharp, so that it cuts what-ever it meets. And we must not forget that the originalfigure of fire (i.e. the pyramid), more than any otherform, has a dividing power which cuts our bodies intosmall pieces (Kepmatizei), and thus naturally producesthat affection which we call heat; and hence the originof the name (thepmos, Kepma). Now, the opposite ofthis is sufficiently manifest; nevertheless we will notfail to describe it. For the larger particles of moisturewhich surround the body, entering in and driving outthe lesser, but not being able to take their places, com-press the moist principle in us; and this from beingunequal and disturbed, is forced by them into a state ofrest, which is due to equability and compression. Butthings which are contracted contrary to nature are bynature at war, and force themselves apart; and to thiswar and convulsion the name of shivering and trem-bling is given; and the whole affection and the cause ofthe affection are both termed cold. That is called hardto which our flesh yields, and soft which yields to ourflesh; and things are also termed hard and soft rela-tively to one another. That which yields has a smallbase; but that which rests on quadrangular bases isfirmly posed and belongs to the class which offers thegreatest resistance; so too does that which is the mostcompact and therefore most repellent. The nature ofthe light and the heavy will be best understood whenexamined in connexion with our notions of above andbelow; for it is quite a mistake to suppose that thePlato’s “Timaeus”51"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"universe is parted into two regions, separate from andopposite to each other, the one a lower to which allthings tend which have any bulk, and an upper towhich things only ascend against their will. For as theuniverse is in the form of a sphere, all the extremities,being equidistant from the centre, are equally extremi-ties, and the centre, which is equidistant from them, isequally to be regarded as the opposite of them all. Suchbeing the nature of the world, when a person says thatany of these points is above or below, may he not bejustly charged with using an improper expression? Forthe centre of the world cannot be rightly called eitherabove or below, but is the centre and nothing else; andthe circumference is not the centre, and has in no onepart of itself a different relation to the centre fromwhat it has in any of the opposite parts. Indeed, whenit is in every direction similar, how can one rightly giveto it names which imply opposition? For if there wereany solid body in equipoise at the centre of the uni-verse, there would be nothing to draw it to this ex-treme rather than to that, for they are all perfectlysimilar; and if a person were to go round the world in acircle, he would often, when standing at the antipodesof his former position, speak of the same point as aboveand below; for, as I was saying just now, to speak of thewhole which is in the form of a globe as having onepart above and another below is not like a sensibleman. The reason why these names are used, and thecircumstances under which they are ordinarily appliedby us to the division of the heavens, may be elucidatedby the following supposition:—if a person were to standin that part of the universe which is the appointedplace of fire, and where there is the great mass of fireto which fiery bodies gather—if, I say, he were to as-cend thither, and, having the power to do this, were toabstract particles of fire and put them in scales andweigh them, and then, raising the balance, were todraw the fire by force towards the uncongenial elementof the air, it would be very evident that he could com-pel the smaller mass more readily than the larger; forwhen two things are simultaneously raised by one andthe same power, the smaller body must necessarily yieldPlato’s “Timaeus”52"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"to the superior power with less reluctance than thelarger; and the larger body is called heavy and said totend downwards, and the smaller body is called lightand said to tend upwards. And we may detect ourselveswho are upon the earth doing precisely the same thing.For we often separate earthy natures, and sometimesearth itself, and draw them into the uncongenial ele-ment of air by force and contrary to nature, both cling-ing to their kindred elements. But that which is smalleryields to the impulse given by us towards the dissimilarelement more easily than the larger; and so we call theformer light, and the place towards which it is impelledwe call above, and the contrary state and place we callheavy and below respectively. Now the relations of thesemust necessarily vary, because the principal masses ofthe different elements hold opposite positions; for thatwhich is light, heavy, below or above in one place willbe found to be and become contrary and transverseand every way diverse in relation to that which is light,heavy, below or above in an opposite place. And aboutall of them this has to be considered:—that the ten-dency of each towards its kindred element makes thebody which is moved heavy, and the place towards whichthe motion tends below, but things which have an op-posite tendency we call by an opposite name. Such arethe causes which we assign to these phenomena. As tothe smooth and the rough, any one who sees them canexplain the reason of them to another. For roughness ishardness mingled with irregularity, and smoothness isproduced by the joint effect of uniformity and density.The most important of the affections which concernthe whole body remains to be considered—that is, thecause of pleasure and pain in the perceptions of which Ihave been speaking, and in all other things which areperceived by sense through the parts of the body, andhave both pains and pleasures attendant on them. Letus imagine the causes of every affection, whether ofsense or not, to be of the following nature, remember-ing that we have already distinguished between thenature which is easy and which is hard to move; forthis is the direction in which we must hunt the preywhich we mean to take. A body which is of a nature toPlato’s “Timaeus”53"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"be easily moved, on receiving an impression howeverslight, spreads abroad the motion in a circle, the partscommunicating with each other, until at last, reachingthe principle of mind, they announce the quality of theagent. But a body of the opposite kind, being immobile,and not extending to the surrounding region, merelyreceives the impression, and does not stir any of theneighbouring parts; and since the parts do not distrib-ute the original impression to other parts, it has noeffect of motion on the whole animal, and thereforeproduces no effect on the patient. This is true of thebones and hair and other more earthy parts of the hu-man body; whereas what was said above relates mainlyto sight and hearing, because they have in them thegreatest amount of fire and air. Now we must conceiveof pleasure and pain in this way. An impression pro-duced in us contrary to nature and violent, if sudden,is painful; and, again, the sudden return to nature ispleasant; but a gentle and gradual return is impercep-tible and vice versa. On the other hand the impressionof sense which is most easily produced is most readilyfelt, but is not accompanied by pleasure or pain; such,for example, are the affections of the sight, which, aswe said above, is a body naturally uniting with ourbody in the day-time; for cuttings and burnings andother affections which happen to the sight do not givepain, nor is there pleasure when the sight returns toits natural state; but the sensations are clearest andstrongest according to the manner in which the eye isaffected by the object, and itself strikes and touches it;there is no violence either in the contraction or dila-tion of the eye. But bodies formed of larger particlesyield to the agent only with a struggle; and then theyimpart their motions to the whole and cause pleasureand pain—pain when alienated from their natural con-ditions, and pleasure when restored to them. Thingswhich experience gradual withdrawings and emptyingsof their nature, and great and sudden replenishments,fail to perceive the emptying, but are sensible of thereplenishment; and so they occasion no pain, but thegreatest pleasure, to the mortal part of the soul, as ismanifest in the case of perfumes. But things which arePlato’s “Timaeus”54"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"changed all of a sudden, and only gradually and withdifficulty return to their own nature, have effects inevery way opposite to the former, as is evident in thecase of burnings and cuttings of the body.Thus have we discussed the general affections of thewhole body, and the names of the agents which pro-duce them. And now I will endeavour to speak of theaffections of particular parts, and the causes and agentsof them, as far as I am able. In the first place let us setforth what was omitted when we were speaking of juices,concerning the affections peculiar to the tongue. Thesetoo, like most of the other affections, appear to becaused by certain contractions and dilations, but theyhave besides more of roughness and smoothness thanis found in other affections; for whenever earthy par-ticles enter into the small veins which are the testinginstruments of the tongue, reaching to the heart, andfall upon the moist, delicate portions of flesh—when,as they are dissolved, they contract and dry up thelittle veins, they are astringent if they are rougher, butif not so rough, then only harsh. Those of them whichare of an abstergent nature, and purge the whole sur-face of the tongue, if they do it in excess, and so en-croach as to consume some part of the flesh itself, likepotash and soda, are all termed bitter. But the particleswhich are deficient in the alkaline quality, and whichcleanse only moderately, are called salt, and having nobitterness or roughness, are regarded as rather agree-able than otherwise. Bodies which share in and are madesmooth by the heat of the mouth, and which are in-flamed, and again in turn inflame that which heatsthem, and which are so light that they are carried up-wards to the sensations of the head, and cut all thatcomes in their way, by reason of these qualities in them,are all termed pungent. But when these same particles,refined by putrefaction, enter into the narrow veins,and are duly proportioned to the particles of earth andair which are there, they set them whirling about oneanother, and while they are in a whirl cause them todash against and enter into one another, and so formhollows surrounding the particles that enter—whichwatery vessels of air (for a film of moisture, sometimesPlato’s “Timaeus”55"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"earthy, sometimes pure, is spread around the air) arehollow spheres of water; and those of them which arepure, are transparent, and are called bubbles, while thosecomposed of the earthy liquid, which is in a state ofgeneral agitation and effervescence, are said to boil orferment—of all these affections the cause is termedacid. And there is the opposite affection arising froman opposite cause, when the mass of entering particles,immersed in the moisture of the mouth, is congenial tothe tongue, and smooths and oils over the roughness,and relaxes the parts which are unnaturally contracted,and contracts the parts which are relaxed, and disposesthem all according to their nature;—that sort of rem-edy of violent affections is pleasant and agreeable toevery man, and has the name sweet. But enough ofthis.The faculty of smell does not admit of differences ofkind; for all smells are of a half-formed nature, and noelement is so proportioned as to have any smell. Theveins about the nose are too narrow to admit earth andwater, and too wide to detain fire and air; and for thisreason no one ever perceives the smell of any of them;but smells always proceed from bodies that are damp,or putrefying, or liquefying, or evaporating, and areperceptible only in the intermediate state, when wateris changing into air and air into water; and all of themare either vapour or mist. That which is passing out ofair into water is mist, and that which is passing fromwater into air is vapour; and hence all smells are thin-ner than water and thicker than air. The proof of thisis, that when there is any obstruction to the respira-tion, and a man draws in his breath by force, then nosmell filters through, but the air without the smellalone penetrates. Wherefore the varieties of smell haveno name, and they have not many, or definite and simplekinds; but they are distinguished only as painful andpleasant, the one sort irritating and disturbing thewhole cavity which is situated between the head andthe navel, the other having a soothing influence, andrestoring this same region to an agreeable and naturalcondition.In considering the third kind of sense, hearing, wePlato’s “Timaeus”56"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"must speak of the causes in which it originates. We mayin general assume sound to be a blow which passesthrough the ears, and is transmitted by means of theair, the brain, and the blood, to the soul, and thathearing is the vibration of this blow, which begins inthe head and ends in the region of the liver. The soundwhich moves swiftly is acute, and the sound whichmoves slowly is grave, and that which is regular is eq-uable and smooth, and the reverse is harsh. A greatbody of sound is loud, and a small body of sound thereverse. Respecting the harmonies of sound I must here-after speak.There is a fourth class of sensible things, having manyintricate varieties, which must now be distinguished.They are called by the general name of colours, and area flame which emanates from every sort of body, andhas particles corresponding to the sense of sight. I havespoken already, in what has preceded, of the causeswhich generate sight, and in this place it will be natu-ral and suitable to give a rational theory of colours.Of the particles coming from other bodies which fallupon the sight, some are smaller and some are larger,and some are equal to the parts of the sight itself.Those which are equal are imperceptible, and we callthem transparent. The larger produce contraction, thesmaller dilation, in the sight, exercising a power akinto that of hot and cold bodies on the flesh, or of astrin-gent bodies on the tongue, or of those heating bodieswhich we termed pungent. White and black are similareffects of contraction and dilation in another sphere,and for this reason have a different appearance. Where-fore, we ought to term white that which dilates thevisual ray, and the opposite of this is black. There isalso a swifter motion of a different sort of fire whichstrikes and dilates the ray of sight until it reaches theeyes, forcing a way through their passages and meltingthem, and eliciting from them a union of fire and waterwhich we call tears, being itself an opposite fire whichcomes to them from an opposite direction—the innerfire flashes forth like lightning, and the outer finds away in and is extinguished in the moisture, and allsorts of colours are generated by the mixture. This af-Plato’s “Timaeus”57"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"fection is termed dazzling, and the object which pro-duces it is called bright and flashing. There is anothersort of fire which is intermediate, and which reachesand mingles with the moisture of the eye without flash-ing; and in this, the fire mingling with the ray of themoisture, produces a colour like blood, to which wegive the name of red. A bright hue mingled with redand white gives the colour called auburn. The law ofproportion, however, according to which the severalcolours are formed, even if a man knew he would befoolish in telling, for he could not give any necessaryreason, nor indeed any tolerable or probable explana-tion of them. Again, red, when mingled with black andwhite, becomes purple, but it becomes umber when thecolours are burnt as well as mingled and the black ismore thoroughly mixed with them. Flame-colour is pro-duced by a union of auburn and dun, and dun by anadmixture of black and white; pale yellow, by an ad-mixture of white and auburn. White and bright meet-ing, and falling upon a full black, become dark blue,and when dark blue mingles with white, a light bluecolour is formed, as flame-colour with black makes leekgreen. There will be no difficulty in seeing how and bywhat mixtures the colours derived from these are madeaccording to the rules of probability. He, however, whoshould attempt to verify all this by experiment, wouldforget the difference of the human and divine nature.For God only has the knowledge and also the powerwhich are able to combine many things into one andagain resolve the one into many. But no man either isor ever will be able to accomplish either the one or theother operation.These are the elements, thus of necessity then sub-sisting, which the creator of the fairest and best ofcreated things associated with himself, when he madethe self-sufficing and most perfect God, using the nec-essary causes as his ministers in the accomplishment ofhis work, but himself contriving the good in all hiscreations. Wherefore we may distinguish two sorts ofcauses, the one divine and the other necessary, andmay seek for the divine in all things, as far as ournature admits, with a view to the blessed life; but thePlato’s “Timaeus”58"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"necessary kind only for the sake of the divine, consid-ering that without them and when isolated from them,these higher things for which we look cannot be appre-hended or received or in any way shared by us.Seeing, then, that we have now prepared for our usethe various classes of causes which are the material outof which the remainder of our discourse must be wo-ven, just as wood is the material of the carpenter, letus revert in a few words to the point at which webegan, and then endeavour to add on a suitable endingto the beginning of our tale.As I said at first, when all things were in disorderGod created in each thing in relation to itself, and in allthings in relation to each other, all the measures andharmonies which they could possibly receive. For inthose days nothing had any proportion except by acci-dent; nor did any of the things which now have namesdeserve to be named at all—as, for example, fire, water,and the rest of the elements. All these the creator firstset in order, and out of them he constructed the uni-verse, which was a single animal comprehending in it-self all other animals, mortal and immortal. Now of thedivine, he himself was the creator, but the creation ofthe mortal he committed to his offspring. And they,imitating him, received from him the immortal prin-ciple of the soul; and around this they proceeded tofashion a mortal body, and made it to be the vehicle ofthe soul, and constructed within the body a soul ofanother nature which was mortal, subject to terribleand irresistible affections,—first of all, pleasure, thegreatest incitement to evil; then, pain, which detersfrom good; also rashness and fear, two foolish counsel-lors, anger hard to be appeased, and hope easily ledastray;—these they mingled with irrational sense andwith all-daring love according to necessary laws, and soframed man. Wherefore, fearing to pollute the divineany more than was absolutely unavoidable, they gaveto the mortal nature a separate habitation in anotherpart of the body, placing the neck between them to bethe isthmus and boundary, which they constructed be-tween the head and breast, to keep them apart. And inthe breast, and in what is termed the thorax, theyPlato’s “Timaeus”59"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"encased the mortal soul; and as the one part of this wassuperior and the other inferior they divided the cavityof the thorax into two parts, as the women’s and men’sapartments are divided in houses, and placed the mid-riff to be a wall of partition between them. That part ofthe inferior soul which is endowed with courage andpassion and loves contention they settled nearer thehead, midway between the midriff and the neck, inorder that it might be under the rule of reason andmight join with it in controlling and restraining thedesires when they are no longer willing of their ownaccord to obey the word of command issuing from thecitadel.The heart, the knot of the veins and the fountain ofthe blood which races through all the limbs, was set inthe place of guard, that when the might of passion wasroused by reason making proclamation of any wrongassailing them from without or being perpetrated bythe desires within, quickly the whole power of feelingin the body, perceiving these commands and threats,might obey and follow through every turn and alley,and thus allow the principle of the best to have thecommand in all of them. But the gods, foreknowingthat the palpitation of the heart in the expectation ofdanger and the swelling and excitement of passion wascaused by fire, formed and implanted as a supporter tothe heart the lung, which was, in the first place, softand bloodless, and also had within hollows like the poresof a sponge, in order that by receiving the breath andthe drink, it might give coolness and the power ofrespiration and alleviate the heat. Wherefore they cutthe air-channels leading to the lung, and placed thelung about the heart as a soft spring, that, when pas-sion was rife within, the heart, beating against a yield-ing body, might be cooled and suffer less, and mightthus become more ready to join with passion in theservice of reason.The part of the soul which desires meats and drinksand the other things of which it has need by reason ofthe bodily nature, they placed between the midriff andthe boundary of the navel, contriving in all this regiona sort of manger for the food of the body; and therePlato’s “Timaeus”60"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"they bound it down like a wild animal which was chainedup with man, and must be nourished if man was toexist. They appointed this lower creation his place herein order that he might be always feeding at the man-ger, and have his dwelling as far as might be from thecouncil-chamber, making as little noise and disturbanceas possible, and permitting the best part to advise qui-etly for the good of the whole. And knowing that thislower principle in man would not comprehend reason,and even if attaining to some degree of perception wouldnever naturally care for rational notions, but that itwould be led away by phantoms and visions night andday,—to be a remedy for this, God combined with itthe liver, and placed it in the house of the lower na-ture, contriving that it should be solid and smooth,and bright and sweet, and should also have a bitterquality, in order that the power of thought, whichproceeds from the mind, might be reflected as in amirror which receives likenesses of objects and givesback images of them to the sight; and so might striketerror into the desires, when, making use of the bitterpart of the liver, to which it is akin, it comes threaten-ing and invading, and diffusing this bitter elementswiftly through the whole liver produces colours likebile, and contracting every part makes it wrinkled andrough; and twisting out of its right place and contort-ing the lobe and closing and shutting up the vesselsand gates, causes pain and loathing. And the conversehappens when some gentle inspiration of the under-standing pictures images of an opposite character, andallays the bile and bitterness by refusing to stir or touchthe nature opposed to itself, but by making use of thenatural sweetness of the liver, corrects all things andmakes them to be right and smooth and free, and ren-ders the portion of the soul which resides about theliver happy and joyful, enabling it to pass the night inpeace, and to practise divination in sleep, inasmuch asit has no share in mind and reason. For the authors ofour being, remembering the command of their fatherwhen he bade them create the human race as good asthey could, that they might correct our inferior partsand make them to attain a measure of truth, placed inPlato’s “Timaeus”61"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"the liver the seat of divination. And herein is a proofthat God has given the art of divination not to thewisdom, but to the foolishness of man. No man, whenin his wits, attains prophetic truth and inspiration; butwhen he receives the inspired word, either his intelli-gence is enthralled in sleep, or he is demented by somedistemper or possession. And he who would understandwhat he remembers to have been said, whether in adream or when he was awake, by the prophetic andinspired nature, or would determine by reason the mean-ing of the apparitions which he has seen, and whatindications they afford to this man or that, of past,present or future good and evil, must first recover hiswits. But, while he continues demented, he cannotjudge of the visions which he sees or the words whichhe utters; the ancient saying is very true, that ‘only aman who has his wits can act or judge about himselfand his own affairs.’ And for this reason it is customaryto appoint interpreters to be judges of the true inspira-tion. Some persons call them prophets; they are quiteunaware that they are only the expositors of dark say-ings and visions, and are not to be called prophets atall, but only interpreters of prophecy.Such is the nature of the liver, which is placed as wehave described in order that it may give prophetic inti-mations. During the life of each individual these inti-mations are plainer, but after his death the liver be-comes blind, and delivers oracles too obscure to be in-telligible. The neighbouring organ (the spleen) is situ-ated on the left-hand side, and is constructed with aview of keeping the liver bright and pure,—like a nap-kin, always ready prepared and at hand to clean themirror. And hence, when any impurities arise in theregion of the liver by reason of disorders of the body,the loose nature of the spleen, which is composed of ahollow and bloodless tissue, receives them all and clearsthem away, and when filled with the unclean matter,swells and festers, but, again, when the body is purged,settles down into the same place as before, and ishumbled.Concerning the soul, as to which part is mortal andwhich divine, and how and why they are separated, andPlato’s “Timaeus”62"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"where located, if God acknowledges that we have spo-ken the truth, then, and then only, can we be confi-dent; still, we may venture to assert that what hasbeen said by us is probable, and will be rendered moreprobable by investigation. Let us assume thus much.The creation of the rest of the body follows next inorder, and this we may investigate in a similar manner.And it appears to be very meet that the body should beframed on the following principles:—The authors of our race were aware that we shouldbe intemperate in eating and drinking, and take a gooddeal more than was necessary or proper, by reason ofgluttony. In order then that disease might not quicklydestroy us, and lest our mortal race should perish with-out fulfilling its end—intending to provide against this,the gods made what is called the lower belly, to be areceptacle for the superfluous meat and drink, and formedthe convolution of the bowels, so that the food mightbe prevented from passing quickly through and com-pelling the body to require more food, thus producinginsatiable gluttony, and making the whole race an en-emy to philosophy and music, and rebellious againstthe divinest element within us.The bones and flesh, and other similar parts of us,were made as follows. The first principle of all of themwas the generation of the marrow. For the bonds of lifewhich unite the soul with the body are made fast there,and they are the root and foundation of the humanrace. The marrow itself is created out of other materi-als: God took such of the primary triangles as werestraight and smooth, and were adapted by their perfec-tion to produce fire and water, and air and earth—these, I say, he separated from their kinds, and min-gling them in due proportions with one another, madethe marrow out of them to be a universal seed of thewhole race of mankind; and in this seed he then plantedand enclosed the souls, and in the original distributiongave to the marrow as many and various forms as thedifferent kinds of souls were hereafter to receive. Thatwhich, like a field, was to receive the divine seed, hemade round every way, and called that portion of themarrow, brain, intending that, when an animal wasPlato’s “Timaeus”63"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"perfected, the vessel containing this substance shouldbe the head; but that which was intended to containthe remaining and mortal part of the soul he distrib-uted into figures at once round and elongated, and hecalled them all by the name ‘marrow’; and to these, asto anchors, fastening the bonds of the whole soul, heproceeded to fashion around them the entire frame-work of our body, constructing for the marrow, first ofall a complete covering of bone.Bone was composed by him in the following manner.Having sifted pure and smooth earth he kneaded it andwetted it with marrow, and after that he put it into fireand then into water, and once more into fire and againinto water—in this way by frequent transfers from oneto the other he made it insoluble by either. Out of thishe fashioned, as in a lathe, a globe made of bone, whichhe placed around the brain, and in this he left a narrowopening; and around the marrow of the neck and backhe formed vertebrae which he placed under one an-other like pivots, beginning at the head and extendingthrough the whole of the trunk. Thus wishing to pre-serve the entire seed, he enclosed it in a stone-likecasing, inserting joints, and using in the formation ofthem the power of the other or diverse as an interme-diate nature, that they might have motion and flexure.Then again, considering that the bone would be toobrittle and inflexible, and when heated and again cooledwould soon mortify and destroy the seed within—hav-ing this in view, he contrived the sinews and the flesh,that so binding all the members together by the sin-ews, which admitted of being stretched and relaxedabout the vertebrae, he might thus make the body ca-pable of flexion and extension, while the flesh wouldserve as a protection against the summer heat andagainst the winter cold, and also against falls, softlyand easily yielding to external bodies, like articles madeof felt; and containing in itself a warm moisture whichin summer exudes and makes the surface damp, wouldimpart a natural coolness to the whole body; and againin winter by the help of this internal warmth wouldform a very tolerable defence against the frost whichsurrounds it and attacks it from without. He who mod-Plato’s “Timaeus”64"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"elled us, considering these things, mixed earth withfire and water and blended them; and making a fermentof acid and salt, he mingled it with them and formedsoft and succulent flesh. As for the sinews, he madethem of a mixture of bone and unfermented flesh,attempered so as to be in a mean, and gave them ayellow colour; wherefore the sinews have a firmer andmore glutinous nature than flesh, but a softer andmoister nature than the bones. With these God coveredthe bones and marrow, binding them together by sin-ews, and then enshrouded them all in an upper cover-ing of flesh. The more living and sensitive of the boneshe enclosed in the thinnest film of flesh, and thosewhich had the least life within them in the thickestand most solid flesh. So again on the joints of thebones, where reason indicated that no more was re-quired, he placed only a thin covering of flesh, that itmight not interfere with the flexion of our bodies andmake them unwieldy because difficult to move; andalso that it might not, by being crowded and pressedand matted together, destroy sensation by reason of itshardness, and impair the memory and dull the edge ofintelligence. Wherefore also the thighs and the shanksand the hips, and the bones of the arms and the fore-arms, and other parts which have no joints, and theinner bones, which on account of the rarity of the soulin the marrow are destitute of reason—all these areabundantly provided with flesh; but such as have mindin them are in general less fleshy, except where thecreator has made some part solely of flesh in order togive sensation,—as, for example, the tongue. But com-monly this is not the case. For the nature which comesinto being and grows up in us by a law of necessity,does not admit of the combination of solid bone andmuch flesh with acute perceptions. More than any otherpart the framework of the head would have had them,if they could have co-existed, and the human race,having a strong and fleshy and sinewy head, wouldhave had a life twice or many times as long as it nowhas, and also more healthy and free from pain. But ourcreators, considering whether they should make alonger-lived race which was worse, or a shorter-livedPlato’s “Timaeus”65"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"race which was better, came to the conclusion thatevery one ought to prefer a shorter span of life, whichwas better, to a longer one, which was worse; and there-fore they covered the head with thin bone, but notwith flesh and sinews, since it had no joints; and thusthe head was added, having more wisdom and sensa-tion than the rest of the body, but also being in everyman far weaker. For these reasons and after this man-ner God placed the sinews at the extremity of the head,in a circle round the neck, and glued them together bythe principle of likeness and fastened the extremities ofthe jawbones to them below the face, and the othersinews he dispersed throughout the body, fasteninglimb to limb. The framers of us framed the mouth, asnow arranged, having teeth and tongue and lips, witha view to the necessary and the good contriving theway in for necessary purposes, the way out for the bestpurposes; for that is necessary which enters in andgives food to the body; but the river of speech, whichflows out of a man and ministers to the intelligence, isthe fairest and noblest of all streams. Still the headcould neither be left a bare frame of bones, on accountof the extremes of heat and cold in the different sea-sons, nor yet be allowed to be wholly covered, and sobecome dull and senseless by reason of an overgrowthof flesh. The fleshy nature was not therefore whollydried up, but a large sort of peel was parted off andremained over, which is now called the skin. This metand grew by the help of the cerebral moisture, andbecame the circular envelopment of the head. And themoisture, rising up under the sutures, watered andclosed in the skin upon the crown, forming a sort ofknot. The diversity of the sutures was caused by thepower of the courses of the soul and of the food, andthe more these struggled against one another the morenumerous they became, and fewer if the struggle wereless violent. This skin the divine power pierced all roundwith fire, and out of the punctures which were thusmade the moisture issued forth, and the liquid andheat which was pure came away, and a mixed part whichwas composed of the same material as the skin, and hada fineness equal to the punctures, was borne up by itsPlato’s “Timaeus”66"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"own impulse and extended far outside the head, butbeing too slow to escape, was thrust back by the exter-nal air, and rolled up underneath the skin, where ittook root. Thus the hair sprang up in the skin, beingakin to it because it is like threads of leather, but ren-dered harder and closer through the pressure of thecold, by which each hair, while in process of separationfrom the skin, is compressed and cooled. Wherefore thecreator formed the head hairy, making use of the causeswhich I have mentioned, and reflecting also that in-stead of flesh the brain needed the hair to be a lightcovering or guard, which would give shade in summerand shelter in winter, and at the same time would notimpede our quickness of perception. From the combi-nation of sinew, skin, and bone, in the structure of thefinger, there arises a triple compound, which, whendried up, takes the form of one hard skin partaking ofall three natures, and was fabricated by these secondcauses, but designed by mind which is the principalcause with an eye to the future. For our creators wellknew that women and other animals would some daybe framed out of men, and they further knew thatmany animals would require the use of nails for manypurposes; wherefore they fashioned in men at theirfirst creation the rudiments of nails. For this purposeand for these reasons they caused skin, hair, and nailsto grow at the extremities of the limbs.And now that all the parts and members of the mor-tal animal had come together, since its life of necessityconsisted of fire and breath, and it therefore wastedaway by dissolution and depletion, the gods contrivedthe following remedy: They mingled a nature akin tothat of man with other forms and perceptions, andthus created another kind of animal. These are the treesand plants and seeds which have been improved bycultivation and are now domesticated among us; an-ciently there were only the wild kinds, which are olderthan the cultivated. For everything that partakes of lifemay be truly called a living being, and the animal ofwhich we are now speaking partakes of the third kindof soul, which is said to be seated between the midriffand the navel, having no part in opinion or reason orPlato’s “Timaeus”67"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"mind, but only in feelings of pleasure and pain and thedesires which accompany them. For this nature is al-ways in a passive state, revolving in and about itself,repelling the motion from without and using its own,and accordingly is not endowed by nature with thepower of observing or reflecting on its own concerns.Wherefore it lives and does not differ from a livingbeing, but is fixed and rooted in the same spot, havingno power of self-motion.Now after the superior powers had created all thesenatures to be food for us who are of the inferior na-ture, they cut various channels through the body asthrough a garden, that it might be watered as from arunning stream. In the first place, they cut two hiddenchannels or veins down the back where the skin andthe flesh join, which answered severally to the rightand left side of the body. These they let down along thebackbone, so as to have the marrow of generation be-tween them, where it was most likely to flourish, andin order that the stream coming down from above mightflow freely to the other parts, and equalize the irriga-tion. In the next place, they divided the veins aboutthe head, and interlacing them, they sent them in op-posite directions; those coming from the right side theysent to the left of the body, and those from the leftthey diverted towards the right, so that they and theskin might together form a bond which should fastenthe head to the body, since the crown of the head wasnot encircled by sinews; and also in order that thesensations from both sides might be distributed overthe whole body. And next, they ordered the water-courses of the body in a manner which I will describe,and which will be more easily understood if we beginby admitting that all things which have lesser partsretain the greater, but the greater cannot retain thelesser. Now of all natures fire has the smallest parts,and therefore penetrates through earth and water andair and their compounds, nor can anything hold it.And a similar principle applies to the human belly; forwhen meats and drinks enter it, it holds them, but itcannot hold air and fire, because the particles of whichthey consist are smaller than its own structure.Plato’s “Timaeus”68"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"These elements, therefore, God employed for the sakeof distributing moisture from the belly into the veins,weaving together a network of fire and air like a weel,having at the entrance two lesser weels; further heconstructed one of these with two openings, and fromthe lesser weels he extended cords reaching all roundto the extremities of the network. All the interior ofthe net he made of fire, but the lesser weels and theircavity, of air. The network he took and spread over thenewly-formed animal in the following manner:—He letthe lesser weels pass into the mouth; there were two ofthem, and one he let down by the air-pipes into thelungs, the other by the side of the air-pipes into thebelly. The former he divided into two branches, both ofwhich he made to meet at the channels of the nose, sothat when the way through the mouth did not act, thestreams of the mouth as well were replenished throughthe nose. With the other cavity (i.e. of the greaterweel) he enveloped the hollow parts of the body, and atone time he made all this to flow into the lesser weels,quite gently, for they are composed of air, and at an-other time he caused the lesser weels to flow back again;and the net he made to find a way in and out throughthe pores of the body, and the rays of fire which arebound fast within followed the passage of the air eitherway, never at any time ceasing so long as the mortalbeing holds together. This process, as we affirm, thename-giver named inspiration and expiration. And allthis movement, active as well as passive, takes place inorder that the body, being watered and cooled, mayreceive nourishment and life; for when the respirationis going in and out, and the fire, which is fast boundwithin, follows it, and ever and anon moving to andfro, enters through the belly and reaches the meat anddrink, it dissolves them, and dividing them into smallportions and guiding them through the passages whereit goes, pumps them as from a fountain into the chan-nels of the veins, and makes the stream of the veinsflow through the body as through a conduit.Let us once more consider the phenomena of respira-tion, and enquire into the causes which have made itwhat it is. They are as follows:—Seeing that there is noPlato’s “Timaeus”69"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"such thing as a vacuum into which any of those thingswhich are moved can enter, and the breath is carriedfrom us into the external air, the next point is, as willbe clear to every one, that it does not go into a vacantspace, but pushes its neighbour out of its place, andthat which is thrust out in turn drives out its neighbour;and in this way everything of necessity at last comesround to that place from whence the breath came forth,and enters in there, and following the breath, fills upthe vacant space; and this goes on like the rotation of awheel, because there can be no such thing as a vacuum.Wherefore also the breast and the lungs, when theyemit the breath, are replenished by the air which sur-rounds the body and which enters in through the poresof the flesh and is driven round in a circle; and again,the air which is sent away and passes out through thebody forces the breath inwards through the passage ofthe mouth and the nostrils. Now the origin of thismovement may be supposed to be as follows. In theinterior of every animal the hottest part is that whichis around the blood and veins; it is in a manner aninternal fountain of fire, which we compare to the net-work of a creel, being woven all of fire and extendedthrough the centre of the body, while the outer partsare composed of air. Now we must admit that heat natu-rally proceeds outward to its own place and to its kin-dred element; and as there are two exits for the heat,the one out through the body, and the other throughthe mouth and nostrils, when it moves towards theone, it drives round the air at the other, and that whichis driven round falls into the fire and becomes warm,and that which goes forth is cooled. But when the heatchanges its place, and the particles at the other exitgrow warmer, the hotter air inclining in that directionand carried towards its native element, fire, pushes roundthe air at the other; and this being affected in the sameway and communicating the same impulse, a circularmotion swaying to and fro is produced by the doubleprocess, which we call inspiration and expiration.The phenomena of medical cupping-glasses and ofthe swallowing of drink and of the projection of bodies,whether discharged in the air or bowled along thePlato’s “Timaeus”70"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"ground, are to be investigated on a similar principle;and swift and slow sounds, which appear to be highand low, and are sometimes discordant on account oftheir inequality, and then again harmonical on accountof the equality of the motion which they excite in us.For when the motions of the antecedent swifter soundsbegin to pause and the two are equalized, the slowersounds overtake the swifter and then propel them. Whenthey overtake them they do not intrude a new anddiscordant motion, but introduce the beginnings of aslower, which answers to the swifter as it dies away,thus producing a single mixed expression out of highand low, whence arises a pleasure which even the un-wise feel, and which to the wise becomes a higher sortof delight, being an imitation of divine harmony inmortal motions. Moreover, as to the flowing of water,the fall of the thunderbolt, and the marvels that areobserved about the attraction of amber and the Heracleanstones,—in none of these cases is there any attraction;but he who investigates rightly, will find that suchwonderful phenomena are attributable to the combina-tion of certain conditions—the non-existence of avacuum, the fact that objects push one another round,and that they change places, passing severally into theirproper positions as they are divided or combined.Such as we have seen, is the nature and such are thecauses of respiration, —the subject in which this dis-cussion originated. For the fire cuts the food and fol-lowing the breath surges up within, fire and breathrising together and filling the veins by drawing up outof the belly and pouring into them the cut portions ofthe food; and so the streams of food are kept flowingthrough the whole body in all animals. And fresh cut-tings from kindred substances, whether the fruits ofthe earth or herb of the field, which God planted to beour daily food, acquire all sorts of colours by theirinter-mixture; but red is the most pervading of them,being created by the cutting action of fire and by theimpression which it makes on a moist substance; andhence the liquid which circulates in the body has acolour such as we have described. The liquid itself wecall blood, which nourishes the flesh and the wholePlato’s “Timaeus”71"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"body, whence all parts are watered and empty placesfilled.Now the process of repletion and evacuation is ef-fected after the manner of the universal motion bywhich all kindred substances are drawn towards oneanother. For the external elements which surround usare always causing us to consume away, and distribut-ing and sending off like to like; the particles of blood,too, which are divided and contained within the frameof the animal as in a sort of heaven, are compelled toimitate the motion of the universe. Each, therefore, ofthe divided parts within us, being carried to its kindrednature, replenishes the void. When more is taken awaythan flows in, then we decay, and when less, we growand increase.The frame of the entire creature when young has thetriangles of each kind new, and may be compared tothe keel of a vessel which is just off the stocks; theyare locked firmly together and yet the whole mass issoft and delicate, being freshly formed of marrow andnurtured on milk. Now when the triangles out of whichmeats and drinks are composed come in from without,and are comprehended in the body, being older andweaker than the triangles already there, the frame ofthe body gets the better of them and its newer tri-angles cut them up, and so the animal grows great,being nourished by a multitude of similar particles. Butwhen the roots of the triangles are loosened by havingundergone many conflicts with many things in thecourse of time, they are no longer able to cut or assimi-late the food which enters, but are themselves easilydivided by the bodies which come in from without. Inthis way every animal is overcome and decays, and thisaffection is called old age. And at last, when the bondsby which the triangles of the marrow are united nolonger hold, and are parted by the strain of existence,they in turn loosen the bonds of the soul, and she,obtaining a natural release, flies away with joy. For thatwhich takes place according to nature is pleasant, butthat which is contrary to nature is painful. And thusdeath, if caused by disease or produced by wounds, ispainful and violent; but that sort of death which comesPlato’s “Timaeus”72"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"with old age and fulfils the debt of nature is the easiestof deaths, and is accompanied with pleasure rather thanwith pain.Now every one can see whence diseases arise. Thereare four natures out of which the body is compacted,earth and fire and water and air, and the unnaturalexcess or defect of these, or the change of any of themfrom its own natural place into another, or—since thereare more kinds than one of fire and of the other ele-ments—the assumption by any of these of a wrongkind, or any similar irregularity, produces disorders anddiseases; for when any of them is produced or changedin a manner contrary to nature, the parts which werepreviously cool grow warm, and those which were drybecome moist, and the light become heavy, and theheavy light; all sorts of changes occur. For, as we af-firm, a thing can only remain the same with itself,whole and sound, when the same is added to it, orsubtracted from it, in the same respect and in the samemanner and in due proportion; and whatever comes orgoes away in violation of these laws causes all mannerof changes and infinite diseases and corruptions. Nowthere is a second class of structures which are alsonatural, and this affords a second opportunity of ob-serving diseases to him who would understand them.For whereas marrow and bone and flesh and sinews arecomposed of the four elements, and the blood, thoughafter another manner, is likewise formed out of them,most diseases originate in the way which I have de-scribed; but the worst of all owe their severity to thefact that the generation of these substances proceedsin a wrong order; they are then destroyed. For thenatural order is that the flesh and sinews should bemade of blood, the sinews out of the fibres to whichthey are akin, and the flesh out of the clots which areformed when the fibres are separated. And the gluti-nous and rich matter which comes away from the sin-ews and the flesh, not only glues the flesh to the bones,but nourishes and imparts growth to the bone whichsurrounds the marrow; and by reason of the solidity ofthe bones, that which filters through consists of thepurest and smoothest and oiliest sort of triangles, drop-Plato’s “Timaeus”73"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"ping like dew from the bones and watering the marrow.Now when each process takes place in this order, healthcommonly results; when in the opposite order, disease.For when the flesh becomes decomposed and sends backthe wasting substance into the veins, then an over-supply of blood of diverse kinds, mingling with air inthe veins, having variegated colours and bitter proper-ties, as well as acid and saline qualities, contains allsorts of bile and serum and phlegm. For all things gothe wrong way, and having become corrupted, firstthey taint the blood itself, and then ceasing to givenourishment to the body they are carried along theveins in all directions, no longer preserving the orderof their natural courses, but at war with themselves,because they receive no good from one another, andare hostile to the abiding constitution of the body,which they corrupt and dissolve. The oldest part of theflesh which is corrupted, being hard to decompose, fromlong burning grows black, and from being everywherecorroded becomes bitter, and is injurious to every partof the body which is still uncorrupted. Sometimes, whenthe bitter element is refined away, the black part as-sumes an acidity which takes the place of the bitter-ness; at other times the bitterness being tinged withblood has a redder colour; and this, when mixed withblack, takes the hue of grass; and again, an auburncolour mingles with the bitter matter when new fleshis decomposed by the fire which surrounds the internalflame;—to all which symptoms some physician perhaps,or rather some philosopher, who had the power of see-ing in many dissimilar things one nature deserving of aname, has assigned the common name of bile. But theother kinds of bile are variously distinguished by theircolours. As for serum, that sort which is the waterypart of blood is innocent, but that which is a secretionof black and acid bile is malignant when mingled by thepower of heat with any salt substance, and is thencalled acid phlegm. Again, the substance which is formedby the liquefaction of new and tender flesh when air ispresent, if inflated and encased in liquid so as to formbubbles, which separately are invisible owing to theirsmall size, but when collected are of a bulk which isPlato’s “Timaeus”74"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"visible, and have a white colour arising out of the gen-eration of foam—all this decomposition of tender fleshwhen intermingled with air is termed by us whitephlegm. And the whey or sediment of newly-formedphlegm is sweat and tears, and includes the variousdaily discharges by which the body is purified. Now allthese become causes of disease when the blood is notreplenished in a natural manner by food and drink butgains bulk from opposite sources in violation of thelaws of nature. When the several parts of the flesh areseparated by disease, if the foundation remains, thepower of the disorder is only half as great, and there isstill a prospect of an easy recovery; but when thatwhich binds the flesh to the bones is diseased, and nolonger being separated from the muscles and sinews,ceases to give nourishment to the bone and to uniteflesh and bone, and from being oily and smooth andglutinous becomes rough and salt and dry, owing tobad regimen, then all the substance thus corruptedcrumbles away under the flesh and the sinews, andseparates from the bone, and the fleshy parts fall awayfrom their foundation and leave the sinews bare andfull of brine, and the flesh again gets into the circula-tion of the blood and makes the previously-mentioneddisorders still greater. And if these bodily affections besevere, still worse are the prior disorders; as when thebone itself, by reason of the density of the flesh, doesnot obtain sufficient air, but becomes mouldy and hotand gangrened and receives no nutriment, and the natu-ral process is inverted, and the bone crumbling passesinto the food, and the food into the flesh, and the fleshagain falling into the blood makes all maladies that mayoccur more virulent than those already mentioned. Butthe worst case of all is when the marrow is diseased,either from excess or defect; and this is the cause ofthe very greatest and most fatal disorders, in which thewhole course of the body is reversed.There is a third class of diseases which may be con-ceived of as arising in three ways; for they are pro-duced sometimes by wind, and sometimes by phlegm,and sometimes by bile. When the lung, which is thedispenser of the air to the body, is obstructed by rheumsPlato’s “Timaeus”75"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"and its passages are not free, some of them not acting,while through others too much air enters, then theparts which are unrefreshed by air corrode, while inother parts the excess of air forcing its way throughthe veins distorts them and decomposing the body isenclosed in the midst of it and occupies the midriff;thus numberless painful diseases are produced, accom-panied by copious sweats. And oftentimes when theflesh is dissolved in the body, wind, generated withinand unable to escape, is the source of quite as muchpain as the air coming in from without; but the great-est pain is felt when the wind gets about the sinewsand the veins of the shoulders, and swells them up,and so twists back the great tendons and the sinewswhich are connected with them. These disorders arecalled tetanus and opisthotonus, by reason of the ten-sion which accompanies them. The cure of them is dif-ficult; relief is in most cases given by fever superven-ing. The white phlegm, though dangerous when de-tained within by reason of the air-bubbles, yet if it cancommunicate with the outside air, is less severe, andonly discolours the body, generating leprous eruptionsand similar diseases. When it is mingled with black bileand dispersed about the courses of the head, which arethe divinest part of us, the attack if coming on insleep, is not so severe; but when assailing those whoare awake it is hard to be got rid of, and being anaffection of a sacred part, is most justly called sacred.An acid and salt phlegm, again, is the source of allthose diseases which take the form of catarrh, but theyhave many names because the places into which theyflow are manifold.Inflammations of the body come from burnings andinflamings, and all of them originate in bile. When bilefinds a means of discharge, it boils up and sends forthall sorts of tumours; but when imprisoned within, itgenerates many inflammatory diseases, above all whenmingled with pure blood; since it then displaces thefibres which are scattered about in the blood and aredesigned to maintain the balance of rare and dense, inorder that the blood may not be so liquefied by heat asto exude from the pores of the body, nor again becomePlato’s “Timaeus”76"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"too dense and thus find a difficulty in circulatingthrough the veins. The fibres are so constituted as tomaintain this balance; and if any one brings them alltogether when the blood is dead and in process of cool-ing, then the blood which remains becomes fluid, but ifthey are left alone, they soon congeal by reason of thesurrounding cold. The fibres having this power overthe blood, bile, which is only stale blood, and whichfrom being flesh is dissolved again into blood, at thefirst influx coming in little by little, hot and liquid, iscongealed by the power of the fibres; and so congealingand made to cool, it produces internal cold and shud-dering. When it enters with more of a flood and over-comes the fibres by its heat, and boiling up throwsthem into disorder, if it have power enough to main-tain its supremacy, it penetrates the marrow and burnsup what may be termed the cables of the soul, and setsher free; but when there is not so much of it, and thebody though wasted still holds out, the bile is itselfmastered, and is either utterly banished, or is thrustthrough the veins into the lower or upper belly, and isdriven out of the body like an exile from a state inwhich there has been civil war; whence arise diarrhoeasand dysenteries, and all such disorders. When the con-stitution is disordered by excess of fire, continuous heatand fever are the result; when excess of air is the cause,then the fever is quotidian; when of water, which is amore sluggish element than either fire or air, then thefever is a tertian; when of earth, which is the mostsluggish of the four, and is only purged away in a four-fold period, the result is a quartan fever, which canwith difficulty be shaken off.Such is the manner in which diseases of the bodyarise; the disorders of the soul, which depend upon thebody, originate as follows. We must acknowledge dis-ease of the mind to be a want of intelligence; and ofthis there are two kinds; to wit, madness and igno-rance. In whatever state a man experiences either ofthem, that state may be called disease; and excessivepains and pleasures are justly to be regarded as thegreatest diseases to which the soul is liable. For a manwho is in great joy or in great pain, in his unseasonablePlato’s “Timaeus”77"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"eagerness to attain the one and to avoid the other, isnot able to see or to hear anything rightly; but he ismad, and is at the time utterly incapable of any partici-pation in reason. He who has the seed about the spinalmarrow too plentiful and overflowing, like a tree over-laden with fruit, has many throes, and also obtainsmany pleasures in his desires and their offspring, and isfor the most part of his life deranged, because his plea-sures and pains are so very great; his soul is renderedfoolish and disordered by his body; yet he is regardednot as one diseased, but as one who is voluntarily bad,which is a mistake. The truth is that the intemperanceof love is a disease of the soul due chiefly to the mois-ture and fluidity which is produced in one of the ele-ments by the loose consistency of the bones. And ingeneral, all that which is termed the incontinence ofpleasure and is deemed a reproach under the idea thatthe wicked voluntarily do wrong is not justly a matterfor reproach. For no man is voluntarily bad; but thebad become bad by reason of an ill disposition of thebody and bad education, things which are hateful toevery man and happen to him against his will. And inthe case of pain too in like manner the soul suffersmuch evil from the body. For where the acid and brinyphlegm and other bitter and bilious humours wanderabout in the body, and find no exit or escape, but arepent up within and mingle their own vapours with themotions of the soul, and are blended with them, theyproduce all sorts of diseases, more or fewer, and inevery degree of intensity; and being carried to the threeplaces of the soul, whichever they may severally assail,they create infinite varieties of ill-temper and melan-choly, of rashness and cowardice, and also of forgetful-ness and stupidity. Further, when to this evil constitu-tion of body evil forms of government are added andevil discourses are uttered in private as well as in pub-lic, and no sort of instruction is given in youth to curethese evils, then all of us who are bad become bad fromtwo causes which are entirely beyond our control. Insuch cases the planters are to blame rather than theplants, the educators rather than the educated. Buthowever that may be, we should endeavour as far as wePlato’s “Timaeus”78"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"can by education, and studies, and learning, to avoidvice and attain virtue; this, however, is part of anothersubject.There is a corresponding enquiry concerning the modeof treatment by which the mind and the body are to bepreserved, about which it is meet and rightthat I should say a word in turn; for it is more ourduty to speak of the good than of the evil. Everythingthat is good is fair, and the fair is not without propor-tion, and the animal which is to be fair must have dueproportion. Now we perceive lesser symmetries or pro-portions and reason about them, but of the highestand greatest we take no heed; for there is no propor-tion or disproportion more productive of health anddisease, and virtue and vice, than that between souland body. This however we do not perceive, nor do wereflect that when a weak or small frame is the vehicleof a great and mighty soul, or conversely, when alittle soul is encased in a large body, then the wholeanimal is not fair, for it lacks the most important of allsymmetries; but the due proportion of mind and bodyis the fairest and loveliest of all sights to him who hasthe seeing eye. Just as a body which has a leg toolong, or which is unsymmetrical in some other re-spect, is an unpleasant sight, and also, when doing itsshare of work, is much distressed and makes convul-sive efforts, and often stumbles through awkward-ness, and is the cause of infinite evil to its own self—in like manner we should conceive of the double na-ture which we call the living being; and when in thiscompound there is an impassioned soul more powerfulthan the body, that soul, I say, convulses and fillswith disorders the whole inner nature of man; andwhen eager in the pursuit of some sort of learning orstudy, causes wasting; or again, when teaching ordisputing in private or in public, and strifes and con-troversies arise, inflames and dissolves the compositeframe of man and introduces rheums; and the natureof this phenomenon is not understood by most pro-fessors of medicine, who ascribe it to the opposite ofthe real cause. And once more, when a body large andtoo strong for the soul is united to a small and weakPlato’s “Timaeus”79"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"intelligence, then inasmuch as there are two desiresnatural to man,—one of food for the sake of the body,and one of wisdom for the sake of the diviner part ofus—then, I say, the motions of the stronger, gettingthe better and increasing their own power, but mak-ing the soul dull, and stupid, and forgetful, engenderignorance, which is the greatest of diseases. There isone protection against both kinds of disproportion:—that we should not move the body without the soulor the soul without the body, and thus they will beon their guard against each other, and be healthy andwell balanced. And therefore the mathematician orany one else whose thoughts are much absorbed insome intellectual pursuit, must allow his body also tohave due exercise, and practise gymnastic; and he whois careful to fashion the body, should in turn impartto the soul its proper motions, and should cultivatemusic and all philosophy, if he would deserve to becalled truly fair and truly good. And the separate partsshould be treated in the same manner, in imitation ofthe pattern of the universe; for as the body is heatedand also cooled within by the elements which enterinto it, and is again dried up and moistened by exter-nal things, and experiences these and the like affec-tions from both kinds of motions, the result is thatthe body if given up to motion when in a state ofquiescence is overmastered and perishes; but if anyone, in imitation of that which we call the foster-mother and nurse of the universe, will not allow thebody ever to be inactive, but is always producing mo-tions and agitations through its whole extent, whichform the natural defence against other motions bothinternal and external, and by moderate exercise re-duces to order according to their affinities the par-ticles and affections which are wandering about thebody, as we have already said when speaking of theuniverse, he will not allow enemy placed by the side ofenemy to stir up wars and disorders in the body, buthe will place friend by the side of friend, so as tocreate health. Now of all motions that is the best whichis produced in a thing by itself, for it is most akin tothe motion of thought and of the universe; but thatPlato’s “Timaeus”80"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"motion which is caused by others is not so good, andworst of all is that which moves the body, when atrest, in parts only and by some external agency. Where-fore of all modes of purifying and re-uniting the bodythe best is gymnastic; the next best is a surging mo-tion, as in sailing or any other mode of conveyancewhich is not fatiguing; the third sort of motion maybe of use in a case of extreme necessity, but in anyother will be adopted by no man of sense: I mean thepurgative treatment of physicians; for diseases unlessthey are very dangerous should not be irritated bymedicines, since every form of disease is in a mannerakin to the living being, whose complex frame has anappointed term of life. For not the whole race only,but each individual—barring inevitable accidents—comes into the world having a fixed span, and thetriangles in us are originally framed with power to lastfor a certain time, beyond which no man can prolonghis life. And this holds also of the constitution ofdiseases; if any one regardless of the appointed timetries to subdue them by medicine, he only aggravatesand multiplies them. Wherefore we ought always tomanage them by regimen, as far as a man can sparethe time, and not provoke a disagreeable enemy bymedicines.Enough of the composite animal, and of the bodywhich is a part of him, and of the manner in which aman may train and be trained by himself so as tolive most according to reason: and we must above andbefore all provide that the element which is to trainhim shall be the fairest and best adapted to that pur-pose. A minute discussion of this subject would be aserious task; but if, as before, I am to give only anoutline, the subject may not unfitly be summed up asfollows.I have often remarked that there are three kinds ofsoul located within us, having each of them motions,and I must now repeat in the fewest words possible,that one part, if remaining inactive and ceasing fromits natural motion, must necessarily become very weak,but that which is trained and exercised, very strong.Wherefore we should take care that the movements ofPlato’s “Timaeus”81"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"the different parts of the soul should be in due propor-tion.And we should consider that God gave the sovereignpart of the human soul to be the divinity of each one,being that part which, as we say, dwells at the top ofthe body, and inasmuch as we are a plant not of anearthly but of a heavenly growth, raises us from earthto our kindred who are in heaven. And in this we saytruly; for the divine power suspended the head androot of us from that place where the generation of thesoul first began, and thus made the whole body up-right. When a man is always occupied with the cravingsof desire and ambition, and is eagerly striving to satisfythem, all his thoughts must be mortal, and, as far as itis possible altogether to become such, he must be mor-tal every whit, because he has cherished his mortalpart. But he who has been earnest in the love of knowl-edge and of true wisdom, and has exercised his intellectmore than any other part of him, must have thoughtsimmortal and divine, if he attain truth, and in so far ashuman nature is capable of sharing in immortality, hemust altogether be immortal; and since he is ever cher-ishing the divine power, and has the divinity withinhim in perfect order, he will be perfectly happy. Nowthere is only one way of taking care of things, and thisis to give to each the food and motion which are natu-ral to it. And the motions which are naturally akin tothe divine principle within us are the thoughts andrevolutions of the universe. These each man shouldfollow, and correct the courses of the head which werecorrupted at our birth, and by learning the harmoniesand revolutions of the universe, should assimilate thethinking being to the thought, renewing his originalnature, and having assimilated them should attain tothat perfect life which the gods have set before man-kind, both for the present and the future.Thus our original design of discoursing about theuniverse down to the creation of man is nearly com-pleted. A brief mention may be made of the generationof other animals, so far as the subject admits of brev-ity; in this manner our argument will best attain a dueproportion. On the subject of animals, then, the fol-Plato’s “Timaeus”82"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"lowing remarks may be offered. Of the men who cameinto the world, those who were cowards or led unrigh-teous lives may with reason be supposed to have changedinto the nature of women in the second generation.And this was the reason why at that time the godscreated in us the desire of sexual intercourse, contriv-ing in man one animated substance, and in woman an-other, which they formed respectively in the followingmanner. The outlet for drink by which liquids passthrough the lung under the kidneys and into the blad-der, which receives and then by the pressure of the airemits them, was so fashioned by them as to penetratealso into the body of the marrow, which passes fromthe head along the neck and through the back, andwhich in the preceding discourse we have named theseed. And the seed having life, and becoming endowedwith respiration, produces in that part in which it re-spires a lively desire of emission, and thus creates in usthe love of procreation. Wherefore also in men the or-gan of generation becoming rebellious and masterful,like an animal disobedient to reason, and maddenedwith the sting of lust, seeks to gain absolute sway; andthe same is the case with the so-called womb or matrixof women; the animal within them is desirous of pro-creating children, and when remaining unfruitful longbeyond its proper time, gets discontented and angry,and wandering in every direction through the body,closes up the passages of the breath, and, by obstruct-ing respiration, drives them to extremity, causing allvarieties of disease, until at length the desire and loveof the man and the woman, bringing them togetherand as it were plucking the fruit from the tree, sow inthe womb, as in a field, animals unseen by reason oftheir smallness and without form; these again are sepa-rated and matured within; they are then finally broughtout into the light, and thus the generation of animalsis completed.Thus were created women and the female sex in gen-eral. But the race of birds was created out of innocentlight-minded men, who, although their minds were di-rected toward heaven, imagined, in their simplicity, thatthe clearest demonstration of the things above was toPlato’s “Timaeus”83"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"be obtained by sight; these were remodelled and trans-formed into birds, and they grew feathers instead ofhair. The race of wild pedestrian animals, again, camefrom those who had no philosophy in any of theirthoughts, and never considered at all about the natureof the heavens, because they had ceased to use thecourses of the head, but followed the guidance of thoseparts of the soul which are in the breast. In conse-quence of these habits of theirs they had their front-legs and their heads resting upon the earth to whichthey were drawn by natural affinity; and the crowns oftheir heads were elongated and of all sorts of shapes,into which the courses of the soul were crushed byreason of disuse. And this was the reason why theywere created quadrupeds and polypods: God gave themore senseless of them the more support that theymight be more attracted to the earth. And the mostfoolish of them, who trail their bodies entirely uponthe ground and have no longer any need of feet, hemade without feet to crawl upon the earth. The fourthclass were the inhabitants of the water: these weremade out of the most entirely senseless and ignorant ofall, whom the transformers did not think any longerworthy of pure respiration, because they possessed asoul which was made impure by all sorts of transgres-sion; and instead of the subtle and pure medium of air,they gave them the deep and muddy sea to be theirelement of respiration; and hence arose the race offishes and oysters, and other aquatic animals, whichhave received the most remote habitations as a punish-ment of their outlandish ignorance. These are the lawsby which animals pass into one another, now, as ever,changing as they lose or gain wisdom and folly.We may now say that our discourse about the natureof the universe has an end. The world has receivedanimals, mortal and immortal, and is fulfilled with them,and has become a visible animal containing the vis-ible—the sensible God who is the image of the intellec-tual, the greatest, best, fairest, most perfect—the oneonly-begotten heaven.Plato’s “Timaeus”84"}]
