Kripal and Wouter J. HanegraaffIn recent years, the academic study of Western esotericism has been developing rapidly from a somewhat obscure specialty pursued by a few dedicated researchers into a burgeoning professional fi eld of scholarly activity and international organization. Once a domain restricted to the relatively secluded circles of specialists and hence hidden from the sight of most academic and non-academic readers, it is now becoming an increasingly popular topic of public and critical discussion in the context of journals, monographs, conferences, and scholarly organiza-tions.1 The book you now hold in your hands is the fruit, one of many, of this growing branch of knowledge.That there are connections between Western esotericism and the domains of eros and sexuality (which extend far beyond what we nor-mally mean by “sex”) has, of course, been recognized before, not least by practitioners, and the various contributions to this volume provide abundant illustration of that fundamental and indubitable fact. But 1 For an overview of the fi eld and its recent development, see Hanegraaff, “The Study of Western Esotericism: New Approaches to Christian and Secular Culture,” in Antes, Geertz & Warne, eds., New Approaches to the Study of Religion. There are two international academic organizations: the European Society for the Study of Western Esotericism (http://www.esswe.org), with an associated journal Aries: Journal for the Study of Western Esotericism (see http://www.brill.nl/m_catalogue_sub6_id9470.htm) and an associated monograph series, the “Aries Book Series” (see http://www.brill.nl/default.aspx?partid=18&pid=24740); and the USA-based Association for the Study of Esotericism (http://www.aseweb.org), which publishes an electronic journal Esoterica (http://www.esoteric.msu.edu). Conferences on Western esotericism are organized each year, alternately by the ASE in the USA and the ESSWE in Europe; permanent ses-sions on Western esotericism have been organized at the quincentennial conferences of the International Association for the History of Religion since 1995, and at the annual conferences of the American Academy of Religion since 2005. The present volume is based upon papers presented at a conference that is part of an annual series organized at Esalen Institute, San Francisco. Further conferences in the domain of Western esotericism, with names of participants and titles of papers, are listed in each issue of Aries. Chairs and teaching programs on Western esotericism currently exist at the Ecole Pratiques des Hautes Etudes (Sorbonne) in Paris, at the University of Amsterdam, and the University of Exeter."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"x jeffrey j. kripal and wouter j. hanegraaffscholarly analyses of how and why the two domains of esotericism and eroticism are so intimately interwoven are diffi cult to fi nd. Moreover, the closely related problem (or is it a promise?) of how the history of sexuality in the West might be related to the history of Western eso-tericism implies a range of further questions that still remains virtually untouched. In the absence of any such developed analysis, only a few tentative suggestions will be made here. In a historical fi eld this new, this rich, and this provocative, all we can reasonably do is point to the heavy fruit hanging low on the branches, and then hope a suffi cient number of readers will choose to begin plucking it. Our own general sense is that such fruit contains its own important truths, but these are, at best, diffi cult to grasp for a whole host of intellectual, linguistic, political, historical, and social reasons.In different ways and for different reasons, or so we would suggest, the domains of Western esotericism, on the one hand, and that of eros and sexuality, on the other, have both tended to become the object of censorship, suppression, concealment, and a certain polite public silence. Both the esoteric and the erotic have, in effect, been repressed, made to hide, “made occult,” as it were. Rather like the Greek god of fertility, Pan, whose iconography was transformed into the cloven-footed and horned “Devil” within the repressions of the Christian imagination, that which is repressed always returns, but as something else, as something “dark” and “dirty,” even “demonic,” that is, as something we should not talk about. And so we don’t. It was one thing to speak of Pan. It is quite another to speak of the Devil.If we ask ourselves how and why this has happened, it may be useful to distinguish between fi ve categories of “things we do not talk about”: those that are concerned, respectively, with secrecy, taboo, concealment, intimacy, and ineffability. As each of these terms carries a different, if also related, semiotic range and its own set of connotations, it seems wise to discuss each in turn before we proceed to the essays. In the process, we hope to give some sense of the essays themselves—their content, their excitement, their own spoken secrets.Secrets and RumorsTo begin, we might note that the term esotericism has often been under-stood as referring to “secrets reserved for an elite,” and hence to the concept of initiation into hidden wisdom in contexts such as mystery"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"  introduction  xicults or secret societies.2 The basic idea here is that certain kinds of knowledge should not be divulged to the multitude, because they would inevitably be misunderstood, misused, or profaned. Certain truths are considered too profound, too complex, too unconventional, perhaps even too shocking to be understood by the common man or woman. Therefore they should be revealed only to those who have gone through a process of careful selection, training, and preparation and have thereby shown themselves capable of a correct understanding. Other truths may be considered too dangerous to be made public. For example, such truths might involve knowledge about techniques and procedures for gaining superior occult powers that should not fall into the wrong hands. Or they may be concerned with secrets about “what is really going on” in history or society: here the assumption is that if the general public would discover the truth, revolts and other threats to social stability and the status quo could be the result.3 And fi nally, the supreme divine truth may simply be considered too sacred to be made available to the profane public: the pearls of spiritual wisdom should not be thrown before the swine, but should remain rather the preserve of a dedicated and pure elite.It is only to be expected, of course, that the need for secrecy will be emphasized even more strongly if such esoteric truths are somehow associated with sexual matters and mysteries. In such cases, after all, the risk of misunderstanding and profanation is particularly strong.4 In some real sense, sex is the secret par excellence. Perhaps this is why the two 2 The term “esotericism” as a substantive was fi rst used by the French scholar Jacques Matter in 1828, but the adjective “esoteric” goes back to the second century (Lucian of Samosata). The fi rst author who used it to refer to secret teachings seems to have been Clement of Alexandria (see Hanegraaff, “Esotericism,” 336; Riffard, L’ésotérisme, 70–73). On esotericism in the sense of “secret teachings” and its relation to Western esotericism, see Faivre, “The Notions of Concealment and Secrecy in Modern Esoteric Currents since the Renaissance”; Hanegraaff, “Esotericism”; de Jong, “Secrecy I: Antiquity”; Fanger, “Secrecy II: Middle Ages”; and Faivre, “Secrecy III: Modernity.”3 When the secret is considered somehow dangerous, discourses on secrecy tend to take the shape of conspiracy theories. For an excellent discussion of this topic, see Barkun, A Culture of Conspiracy.4 But even in cases belonging to the second subcategory just mentioned—secrets concerning “what is really going on”—one very often fi nds that they include a sexual dimension. A convenient example is the notorious case of Dan Brown’s The Da Vinci Code: the basic idea is that the Roman Catholic Church has suppressed the truth about Jesus and Mary Magdalene, but, of course, that truth becomes much more titillating by the very concept that Jesus had sex and by the motif of an underground tradition of sexual rites that have continued to the present day."},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"xii jeffrey j. kripal and wouter j. hanegraaffdomains have historically been linked in the social imagination, even when they have not been necessarily linked in historical fact. Indeed, the fact that numerous groups and organizations have had a practice of secrecy has often caused suspicions about sexual goings-on: things that are so carefully kept hidden from the light of day must surely be somehow scandalous and obscene, that is, the secret must be about sex. Examples of both cases—sexual teachings and practices that are kept secret, and secret teachings and practices believed to be sexual—are discussed by various authors in this volume: from the Borborites and the Valentinians discussed by Roelof van den Broek and April DeConick to the Utopian communities treated by Arthur Versluis, and from the sexual techniques and rituals described by John Patrick Deveney and Marco Pasi to the sex-magical orders central to the chapters by Hugh Urban and Hans Thomas Hakl. As such essays reveal, many times the suspicions of sex, though exaggerated for polemical purposes, were in fact more or less accurate.Taboo and TransgressionWhereas the category of esotericism, then, has often been understood as referring to secrecy, the terminology of Western esotericism that is basic to the present volume has a very different meaning. Since the 1990s (but building on older traditions, particularly in the French academic context), it has come to be understood by scholars as an umbrella con-cept that covers a complex domain of interrelated historical currents and ideas that have existed in Western culture from late antiquity to the present and which may or may not (that is to say, which do not necessarily) include a dimension of secrecy.5The current debate about precise defi nitions and demarcations of the professional fi eld of Western esotericism is complex and technical and need not detain us here. What can be said, however, and with some certainty, is that, until very recently, most of the currents that fall under the rubric of Western esotericism ended up in the category of “things we do not talk about.” Note that in this case we are not dealing with secrecy per se, but with the power of taboos in academic discourse itself. Scholars were aware that by including the various manifestations 5 For an overview of the fi eld as a whole, see Hanegraaff, ed., Dictionary of Gnosis and Western Esotericism."},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"  introduction  xiiiof Western esotericism within the domain of “legitimate” academic research they ran a serious risk of fi nding themselves excluded: topics associated with “the occult” have tended to be perceived by most aca-demics as a “no go area” unworthy of serious study, and hence scholars who published studies of them easily evoked suspicions of being inspired by other than scholarly agendas. In all fairness, it must be said that often enough, rather like the traditional suspicions of secrecy meaning sex, such occult suspicions were in fact more or less correct.6 But, inevitably, the sum effect of the taboo on studying esotericism was that neutral, critical, and historical research was strongly discouraged along with the crypto-esoteric scholarship. This has resulted in a very serious lack of expertise among academics about what are in fact large and important dimensions of the Western heritage. It is this defect of knowledge that the modern study of Western esotericism seeks to correct. It is time to talk about the things we do not talk about. Needless to say, open and critical discussion of eroticism and sexual-ity and their relevance to broader issues in the history of religion and culture was likewise taboo in academic research, at least up to the twentieth century. This censoring situation changed dramatically after the defi nitive emergence of psychoanalysis before World War II, the sexual revolution of the shared European and American counterculture of the 1960s (catalyzed by such radical psychoanalytic fi gures as Wilhelm Reich, who actually coined the term “sexual revolution”), and, about the same time, the birth of the women’s movement and its subsequent waves of feminist criticism and critical gender analysis. Finally, the gay rights movement of the late 60’s and 70s was followed by academic research and writing on the intimate ways that sexual orientation fi gures into religious discourses and practices. Because of these central psychological, intellectual, and social revolutions, scholarly attention to the importance of eros and sexuality in religion and culture is by now quite normal and uncontroversial, at least within Western academic culture and open liberal societies. The situation is quite different in many other parts of the world, where such open discussions are still taboo and more or less impossible. 6 For more on the crypto-esoteric agendas in the context of “religionist” contexts, especially in a countercultural context since the 1960s, and their negative effect on the academic acceptance of the fi eld, see Hanegraaff, “Beyond the Yates Paradigm: The Study of Western Esotericism between Counterculture and New Complexity.”"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"xiv jeffrey j. kripal and wouter j. hanegraaffThat sexual and erotic dimensions are present in Western esotericism is hardly surprising, as such dimensions are omnipresent throughout the history of religion. Every human being, after all, has had a gendered body with sexual characteristics, regardless of time and clime. In some basic sense, then, sexuality transcends time, at least that brief micro-fraction of it we can access through historical-critical methods. But there is reason to assume that, in addition to these obvious biological universals (themselves always informed by relative cultural practices, that is, by history), we are also dealing with an elective affi nity of some kind between the two domains of esotericism and eroticism. That is, we have reason to suspect that “something else” is going on here. Some clues in that direction can be found, for instance, in Elliot Wolfson’s essay on discourse and intercourse as refl ective of divine being in kabbalistic contemplation, and of what he dialectically names “the erotic nature of secrecy and the secret nature of eros.” In the rhetorical revealing and concealing structures of secrecy itself, Wolfson notes, “one can discern something resonant with the nature of eros.” Other hints can be had in Lawrence Principe’s discussion of how the use of sexual symbolism in alchemy results quite logically from the nature of pre-modern science and its confl icting needs to explain and to conceal; and in Allison Coudert’s analysis of the gendered demono-logical discourse in early modern Europe through which fi rm gender polarities were protected and preserved through, for example, female curiosity being symbolically linked with sexual promiscuity. The link-ing of forbidden knowledge, women, and sex extend well beyond the primordial garden, it turns out. And there is still more. Indeed, what is so striking about so many of the fi gures treated in these essays is their conviction that in the depths of human sexuality lies hidden the secret of religion, occultism, magical power, spirituality, transcendence, life, God, Being itself. This astonishing connection, such fi gures would insist, is not metaphorical, or rhetori-cal, or symbolic, as some would prefer to have it. It is fundamental, cosmic, ontological, religious. We are not dealing here, then, with a politics or sociology or anthropology of sex. We are dealing with a metaphysics of sex, itself intimately entwined with the destiny of the soul. The historian of Western esotericism, of course, must remain agnostic about such fi nal matters, but the historical data are quite clear about what our sources thought and wrote. Hans Thomas Hakl’s comments on the sex-magical instructions of Giuliano Kremmerz seem particularly appropriate here:"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"  introduction  xvWhat is the aim of all these instructions? Certainly not a refi nement of sexual pleasures, a subjugation of women, kinky sex games, or sexual lib-eration. By means of a prolonged regimen of fasting, breathing exercises, prolonged chastity, meditation, and years of general magical preparation, a superior magical force is to be developed: a force so strong that it should be capable of conquering everything, even physical death.Concealing and RevealingA third category of “things we do not talk about” concerns things we might actually like to talk about but which are hidden and therefore need to be discovered or unveiled fi rst. It is not that they are neces-sarily kept secret or considered taboo: they are just diffi cult to fi nd, understand, or interpret. They are, in a word, concealed. The history of Western esotericism is full of references to hidden wisdom, hidden messages, hidden powers, and hidden realities. Helena P. Blavatsky’s famous Isis Unveiled (1877) is only one among many texts that claim to lift the veil hanging over the true nature of reality. According to the sixteenth-century physician and alchemist Paracelsus, nature could be read as a book: it was full of hidden messages from God that could only be perceived and understood if one learned how to recognize and read the “signatures of things.” Hence the term occult means “hidden” (Latin occultus) and was originally a technical term in natural philosophy pertaining to those qualities or forces in nature that were not directly observable by the senses but could not be theoretically accounted for in terms of the reigning natural philosophy either, in other words, the kinds of invisible forces and infl uences that were particularly important to the so-called “occult sciences” of astrology, alchemy, and natural magic.7 In a similar spirit, Islamic esotericism, as explained by Pierre Lory in this volume, treats the normally invisible or “inward” side of reality, as opposed to the outward or apparent reality accessible to the normal senses, as something fundamentally real but also as something somehow dangerous, sometimes demonic, and, potentially at least, something erotic.The very language of “veiling and unveiling” (“lifting the veils,” catching a glimpse of what is “under the veil,” revealing as un-veiling) has obvious masculine, voyeuristic, and hence erotic connotations. This 7 See Hanegraaff, “Occult/Occultism.”"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"xvi jeffrey j. kripal and wouter j. hanegraaffprovides us with another explanation for how eroticism comes to play a role in esoteric contexts. Again, the subtle erotic interplay of veiling and unveiling, concealing and revealing, is evident in Elliot Wolfson’s reading of kabbalistic texts. Another clear case is Wouter J. Hanegraaff ’s discussion of Giordano Bruno and the myth of the hunter Actaeon who, spurred on by eros—the desire for eternal beauty—fi nally glimpses the nude goddess Diana (Nature unveiled) while she is taking her bath. The result? He is both killed and transfi gured within this very act of mystical/erotic transgression.Reversely, however, it must also be noted that a trend towards the “disoccultation of the occult” has become prominent in Western esoteric contexts, at least since the nineteenth century, particularly in the type of Spiritualist discourse discussed by Cathy Gutierrez in this volume, but also in its later esoteric developments, up to and including contemporary spiritual trends such as those discussed by Jeffrey Kripal with reference to Esalen and what we might call a democratization of Western esotericism. The erotic secret is out. We know now. And we can talk about what we know.Intimacy and PoignancyThe “things we do not talk about” may be secret, taboo, or concealed; but they can also be considered too intimate to be easily shared. With-holding them from public discussion and scrutiny may be considered a simple matter of discretion rather than a cause for putting up barriers of formal initiation. In the context of the history of Western esotericism, this brings us to the domain of personal religious experience and its sub-jective psychological description. We possess numerous texts that make discrete allusions to (rather than spell out) certain events that occurred in the author’s personal spiritual life, or that refer to subtle feelings and emotional nuances which resist straightforward verbalization or logical analysis. We also know of cases of specifi c communities devoted to a spiritual way of life whose members shared a common experience of divine presence that they preferred to keep among themselves, and which indeed might not have been accessible to anyone except through active daily participation.The erotic dimension comes into play almost inevitably whenever such personal or communal experiences concern intimate contact with personifi ed spiritual entities. There is something deeply personal, and"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"  introduction  xviideeply poignant, here. A particularly clear example is Antoine Faivre’s discussion of how Christian theosophers during the seventeenth cen-tury experienced their relations with the virgin Sophia as one of erotic play and actual sexual/spiritual intercourse (even leading to pregnancy on the part of the male theosopher!). Here too we might mention how members of a theosophical community—perhaps not unlike the Valentinians described by April DeConick—tried to “rush into the bedroom” of the bride in order to join in the communal love-feast. A comparable dimension of erotic intimacy is likewise prominent in Moshe Idel’s subtle discussions of the phenomenology of erotic delight in theosophical Kabbalah and Hasidic literature; the murmured secrets of Elliot Wolfson’s chapter; the Latin commentaries on the Song of Songs, with all their kisses, analyzed by Claire Fanger; Marsilio Ficino’s homo-erotic desires diagnosed in Wouter J. Hanegraaff ’s contribution; and Arthur Versluis’s elaborate discussion of the erotic mysticisms of nineteenth-century American visionaries. As we approach the present, such intimacies, we might notice, become more and more descriptive, self-confessed, autobiographical, that is, they become less private and more textualized. Hence whereas it is exceedingly diffi cult (though not impossible) to fi nd explicit autobiographical descriptions of esoteric experience in a medieval Latin or Hebrew text, it is not at all uncom-mon in a seventeenth- or eighteenth-century German or Dutch milieu, and it is exceptionally easy to fi nd such things in a nineteenth- or twentieth-century English document. Intimacy is intimacy, but the secret is becoming less of a secret as the centuries tick by. We might also wonder here about European and American cultural differences and their respective effects on esoteric discourse, that is, on what can and cannot be said. Ineffability and ProlixityFinally, there are “things we do not talk about” not because we do not want to, but simply because we are not able to. References to the ineffable are more prominent in Western esotericism than one might perhaps think. They are typically associated with a superior knowledge or “gnosis” that cannot be transmitted by words or even symbols, but must be directly experienced. The question of how such gnosis relates to mystical experience (which, at least according to William James, contains a “noetic” dimension) cannot fail to impose itself on the"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"xviii jeffrey j. kripal and wouter j. hanegraaffreader of many chapters in this volume. In the present context, it is important to note that the theme of a “higher,” “superior,” or “abso-lute” knowledge, the contents of which resist verbalization or rational understanding, has often been considered central to Western esotericism as a fi eld of study.8 Indeed, Kocku von Stuckrad has recently argued that it is precisely this strong noetic quality that fi nally sets apart the fi eld of Western esotericism from the related semiotic fi eld of “mysti-cism.” Such a noetic wisdom or gnosis, however, is seldom of a linear or rational quality. It is typically more immediate, direct, intuitive—it thus displays a certain “all at once” quality that is claimed to be com-plete or perfect in itself but will take years, maybe an entire life, to explicate and unfold into a textual corpus (often of literally thousands of pages). It is a paradox often noted: the ineffable tends to produce an almost unbelievable prolixity. That which cannot be said gets said, and said, and said.Here too we are reminded of the erotic, which is always overdeter-mined as something saturated with meaning, as something that can never be fully articulated. One perhaps does not need to be reminded of the etymological connections and mythological associations between knowing and sexual intercourse (although they certainly help),9 or of such obvious facts as that sexual pleasure can never be adequately described but only fi nally experienced (rather like the sacred in some theories), to make the point that Western esoteric sources often describe the attainment of an ineffable mystical gnosis in erotic and sexual terms, that is, as a “consummation,” “embrace,” “unitive bliss,” “rapture,” “kiss,” “cleaving,” “marriage,” and so on.All languages of sexual union, however, imply a polarity, that is, two fi gures that embrace, that unite, that become one. This is the most basic sexual polarity that structures, universally, the innumerable erotic languages, mythologies, and symbolisms of the history of religion. Enter the modern categories of gender and sexual orientation. The history of erotic mystical literature, after all, is fi lled with biological males uniting with male deities. Indeed, as one of the two editors ( Jeffrey Kripal) 8 See, for example, Neugebauer-Wölk, “ ‘Höhere Vernunft’ und ‘höheres Wissen’ als Leitbegriffe in der esoterischen Gesellschaftsbewegung”; von Stuckrad, “Western Esotericism: Towards an Integrative Model of Interpretation”; and Kilcher, ed., Die Enzyklopädik der Esoterik: Allwissenheitsmythen und universalwissenschaftliche Modelle in der Esoterik der Neuzeit.9 See, for example, Doniger, Carnal Knowledge."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"  introduction  xixhas argued elsewhere, in the history of Western religion (and indeed, of much of Asian religion as well), male mystical systems that employ sexual symbolism inevitably tend toward an orthodox sublimated homo-erotic structure.10 Precisely to the extent that a heteroerotic structure is set up for males—that is, to the extent that the divine is imagined as a female with whom the male aspirant enjoys hidden intercourse—the system tends to become heterodox, if not actually heretical.Such a comparative thesis is certainly borne out in the present collec-tion of essays, so many of which treat male heteroerotic traditions that were suppressed, persecuted, or simply forgotten by their surrounding orthodox religious cultures. Thus whereas those traditions that featured an active or explicit heterosexual symbolism—like the bridal chamber of the early Valentinian Christians studied by April DeConick, or the modern sexual magical traditions studied by Patrick John Deveney, Thomas Hans Hakl, and Hugh Urban—became heterodox or heretical, those traditions that were successfully incorporated by their surrounding religious cultures, like Latin bridal mysticism, Kabbalah, and Sufi sm, tended strongly toward a male same-sex structure, with male mystics loving and enjoying “hidden intercourse” with a male God. This is not to say, of course, that we do not fi nd homosexual practices within heteroerotic systems (Theodore Reuss’s phallus cult or some of Aleister Crowley’s more transgressive rituals come to mind here), or that we do not fi nd heteroerotic features in the orthodox mystical systems (Mary as the bride of Christ, or the Sufi jinniya or female spiritual consorts), only that it is virtually impossible to win orthodox approval for any explicit heterosexual mystical or magical system.Intriguingly, Wouter Hanegraaff ’s essay on the two Renaissance fi gures of Marsilio Ficino and Giordano Bruno demonstrates both sides of this same thesis. Hence Ficino, whose “Platonic” desires Hanegraaff analyzes as distinctly homoerotic, turned to a translation project involving Plato’s Symposium and a sublimated celibate life. He was thus embraced by his own Roman Catholic tradition. Bruno, on the other hand, whose desires appear to be anything but homoerotic, was burned at a stake. It is important to admit, of course, that Bruno was not burned for his heteroerotic desires per se, but these, we might speculate, hardly helped him to fi t into the reigning homoerotic religious system of his time and played, in turn, into his elaborate language of 10 See Kripal, Roads of Excess, Palaces of Wisdom; and The Serpent’s Gift."},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"xx jeffrey j. kripal and wouter j. hanegraaff“fi re” and “passion,” a fi ery passion that could not be fi tted into the male homoerotic structures of Italian Catholicism. For such a promi-nent male to think heterosexually about divine things in the West is to think heretically. Such thoughts raise fascinating questions about the linking of eros, (hetero)sexuality, heresy, and secrecy in the history of Western eso-tericism.

One of them is known as Hermetism, and the other is usually called Gnosticism.The hermetic current claimed to transmit the teachings of the ancient Egyptian sage Hermes Trismegistus.1 The magical, astrological, and alchemical hermetic writings attributed to Hermes, and usually referred to as the “technical hermetica,” fall beyond the scope of the present chapter, which concentrates on what is known as “philosophical Her-metism.” Its most characteristic feature is the idea of an indissoluble interrelationship between God, the cosmos, and man, which implies the unity of the universe. The fi nal aim of the hermetic teaching was to lead its adepts to the worship of the supreme God as the source of being, and eventually to union with him through initiation. Although it is common usage to speak of “Hermetism” in the singular, we should realize that its doctrines showed a great variety and never developed into one coherent system.2 The hermetic writings are strongly infl uenced by various Greek philosophical ideas, some of them quite incompat-ible, but also by Jewish and Egyptian mythological and theological speculations.The gnostic current was characterized by a strong emphasis on the esoteric and salvifi c character of the spiritual knowledge it claimed to possess. In the second and third centuries A.D., this general current led to a number of elaborate mythological gnostic systems, which are known from original documents and from the refutations by opponents (both Christian theologians and Greek philosophers). In his brilliant book of 1 On Hermes Trismegistus and ancient Hermetism in general, see Fowden, The Egyptian Hermes, and van den Broek, “Hermes Trismegistus I: Antiquity,” “Hermetism,” and “Hermetic Literature I: Antiquity.”2 On this variety, see van den Broek, “Hermetism.”"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"2 roelof van den broek1996, Rethinking “Gnosticism,” Michael Williams has convincingly shown that the popular view of Gnosticism as a monolithic religious move-ment is untenable. He concluded that it would be better to dismantle the whole category of “Gnosticism” altogether, and that terms such as “gnosis” or “Gnosticism,” “gnostic,” and “gnostic religion” are so vague that they have lost any specifi c meaning and should be avoided as well.3 Elsewhere I have argued that while Williams’ analysis is con-vincing, his solution is too radical. The terms “gnosis” and “gnostic” are perfectly applicable to all ideas and currents, from Antiquity to the present day, that emphasize the idea of a revealed secret gnosis (spiritual knowledge) as a gift that illuminates and liberates man’s inner self. The term “Gnosticism,” however, should better be restricted to the mythological gnostic systems of the fi rst centuries.4Under the infl uence of Platonism, the philosophical and religious thought of late antiquity was pervaded by an ascetic tendency, which often led to a negative view of the body and sexuality and, for that reason, to the propagation of sexual asceticism. These views exerted a strong infl uence on early Christianity (especially in Egypt and Syria) and on Gnosticism, but to a much lesser extent on Hermetism, as will be seen. Although the hermetists generally considered the body a dan-ger for the soul, there is only one hermetic text, the Poimandres (Corpus Hermeticum I ), that sees sexual desire as the cause of death and of all evil. Most of the gnostic writings, on the other hand, both Christian and non-Christian, interpret sexuality as the bad demiurge’s principal instrument for enslaving the human being. The fi fty-two gnostic writ-ings found at Nag Hammadi in 19455 contain not a single passage that could give support to the common anti-gnostic allegation that sexual libertinism and promiscuity were practiced among the gnostics. It is therefore all the more interesting that certain hermetic and gnostic texts, as well as ancient reports on specifi c gnostic views, testify to a positive view of sexuality and even see it as indispensable for salvation. Most notable in this regard are the hermetic Asclepius (chapter 21) and, on the gnostic side, the alleged views of the Valentinians and Borborites. Since the Valentinian speculations on marriage and sexuality are dis-3 Williams, Rethinking “Gnosticism.”4 Van den Broek, “Gnosticism I: Gnostic Religion”; see also Pearson, Ancient Gnosti-cism, 8–12.5 On the discovery of the Nag Hammadi Library and its later vicissitudes, see Robinson, “Nag Hammadi: The First Fifty Years.”"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":" hermetic and gnostic thought 3cussed by April DeConick elsewhere in this volume, this chapter will concentrate on the hermetic views of sexuality, as expressed in the Poimandres and the Asclepius, and on the sexual practices of the gnostic sect of the Borborites.6Hermetic Ideas about Sex and SexualityAccording to hermetic anthropology, the human being has two natures: he participates in the divine world by means of his immortal soul (or his mind), but he is part of the material world by means of his mortal body.7 The material world, and the body in particular, poses a constant threat to the soul, because it tends to absorb it and make it forget its heavenly origin. This could lead to a gloomy view of the human condition, as for instance in CH VI, entitled The Good is in God alone and nowhere else:There is no room for it [the good] in the material body, which is squeezed on all sides by vice, sufferings, pains, desires, angry feelings, delusions and mindless opinions. And the worst of all, Asclepius, is that here below they believe that each of the things I have just mentioned is the greatest good while actually it is insuperable evil.8Accordingly, the hermetic writings admonish their readers to despise and hate the material body. A few examples:Who behaves well towards his body, behaves badly towards himself.9If you do not fi rst hate your body, my child, you cannot love yourself, but when you love yourself, you will have mind, and if you have mind, you will also partake of knowledge.10People who love the body will never be able to see the vision of the beautiful and the good.11 6 The editions used in this chapter are the ones mentioned in the bibliography. The quotations are directly based on the original texts; in translating them I gratefully made use of the translations that are listed in the bibliography. 7 See for instance CH I, 15: “Because of this, unlike any other living thing on earth, mankind is twofold—in the body mortal but immortal in the essential man”; Defi nitions VI, 1 (preserved in Greek and Armenian): “Man has at once the two natures, the mortal and the immortal one.” 8 CH VI, 3. 9 Defi nitions IX, 5, both in Greek and Armenian.10 CH IV, 6.11 Stobaeus, Fragm.

And yet, the Asclepius contains a very positive evaluation of the sexual union of man and woman. In order to explain this seeming paradox, we have to look at the notion of androgyny as the perfect form of sexuality.An important aspect of the hermetic ideas about God was the concept of his androgyny. An explicit statement is found in the Poimandres: The Mind (nous) who is God, being androgynous and existing as life and light, by speaking gave birth to another mind (nous), a craftsman . . .12Likewise we read in the Asclepius: God, the only and the All, completely full of the fertility of both sexes and ever pregnant with his own will, always begets whatever he wishes to procreate.13Although the mention of the divine will gives a philosophical twist to this remark, the original idea was that the androgynous God is pregnant ( praegnans) of everything and produces everything out of himself. He is not only his own father (autopatōr) and his own mother (automētōr),14 but also the father and the mother of the universe, as in CH V: If you force me to say something still more daring, it is his essence to be pregnant (kuein) with all things and to make them.15 The verb that is used here, kuein, can only be used with reference to a woman; it means to “become or be pregnant.” God is male and female at the same time: he begets everything and is pregnant of everything. In the fi nal hymn of the Asclepius, in its original version as preserved in the Coptic Prayer of Thanksgiving16 and in the fragmentary Greek Papyrus Mimaut, the bisexual language of procreation comes to the surface in plain terms:We know you, O intellectual Light, O Life of life,We know you, O Womb of every creature, 12 CH I, 9.13 Asclepius 20.14 Thus a hermetic source in Lactantius, Divinae Institutiones, I, 8, 5 (Nock & Festugière IV, 112–113, nr. 13).15 CH V, 9.16 Nag Hammadi Codex VI, 7 (henceforth NHC)."},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":" hermetic and gnostic thought 5We know you, O Womb pregnant by the member [ physis = phallus] of the Father. We know you, O eternal permanence of the pregnant Father.17The Greek words used here are patros kuēphorountos. The verb kuēphorein means to “bear in the womb, be pregnant,” and, accordingly, can only be used with reference to a woman. The Coptic translation has the word čpo, which means to “beget, bring forth,” which can be used with reference to both male and female beings. Dirkse and Brashler correctly translate the Coptic as: “O eternal permanence of the begetting Father.” The Coptic translator apparently found the original Greek expression, “the pregnant Father,” so alarming that he thought it wise to use a word that better fi tted the procreative activity of a father.The view of the highest God as bisexual implies that androgyny is the most perfect form of sexuality.18 This led to two different evaluations of human sexuality: on the one hand, the sexual desire that resulted from the separation of originally androgynous mankind into males and females could be interpreted negatively as the cause of death; but, on the other hand, the sexual union of man and woman could also be praised as the mystical representation of the divine androgynous fertility. The fi rst interpretation is found in the Poimandres, the second in the Asclepius.The PoimandresAccording to the myth of the Poimandres, after the second Mind, the Craftsman, the supreme Mind created a third divine being called Man (Anthrōpos), to whom he gave authority over the whole cosmos. The heavenly Man looked through the cosmic framework, saw his image refl ected in the waters of Nature below, and wanted to inhabit it. Nature, from her side, smiled with love at the sight of the beautiful form of Man, and they became lovers.19 Then the text continues:When Nature had intercourse with Man, she bore a wonder most wondrous. . . . and without delay Nature gave birth to seven men whose natures corresponded to those of the seven (planetary) governors and 17 NHC VI, 64, 25–29.18 The idea of divine androgyny derives from Egyptian mythological theology, as has been convincingly argued by Daumas, “Le fonds égyptienne de l’Hermétisme,” and Zandee, “Der Hermetismus und das alte Ägypten,” 120–125.19 CH I, 12–15."},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"6 roelof van den broekwho were androgynous and walked upright. . . . From life and light man became soul and mind; from life soul, from light mind, and all things of the perceptible world remained in that state until the end of a cycle and the beginning of the species. . . . When the cycle was completed, the bond of all things was loosed by the will of God. All living beings, which had been androgynous, were parted asunder together with the human being and part of them became male, part likewise female.20The author apparently made use of a Jewish source, which has also left its traces in the Pseudo-Clementine Recognitions, I, 29. This text says that the fi rst seven generations of the human race lived the sin-less life of the angels and knew no sexual desire, but that the eighth generation, seduced by the beauty of the women, began to practice illicit intercourse, which led to the birth of giants and, fi nally, to the Flood (cf. Genesis 6). According to this source, the Fall did not occur in Paradise but at the end of the fi rst period of the world, which ended with the Flood. There is little doubt that the Recognitions’ seven angelic generations until the Flood and the seven androgynous human beings of the fi rst world period in the Poimandres represent the same mythological tradition. In the biblical account of the Fall, there is only a faint hint that the Fall has anything to do with sexuality, viz. when we read that after eating the forbidden fruit Adam’s and Eve’s eyes “were opened and they discovered that they were naked.”21 But in the Jewish myth behind the Recognitions and the Poimandres the connection is quite clear.As a matter of fact, the Poimandres does not say that the splitting up of the original androgynous beings into males and females was the result of sinful sexual desire or a divine punishment. After the quotation given above, the text continues:But God immediately spoke a holy word: “Increase in number and mul-tiply in multitude, all you creatures and craftworks. And let him who has mind recognize that he is immortal and that desire is the cause of death, and let him so know all that exists.”22With an obvious reference to Genesis 1:28, “Be fruitful and increase, fi ll the earth,” the Poimandres admits that sexuality and procreation are necessary for the continuation of the human race. But at the same time it points out that they are dangerous, because they can make one forget one’s immortality; sexual desire, moreover, is seen as the ultimate cause 20 CH I, 16–18.21 Genesis 3:7.22 CH I, 18."},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":" hermetic and gnostic thought 7of death. The person who is in the possession of mind (nous) should not forget his divine descent and realize that sexual desire is the ultimate cause of death: children are born to die. If he does so, he will know the All. Scholars agree that this is a clear echo of the hermetic saying in Defi nitions IX:Who thinks of himself in Nous knows himself and who knows himself knows everything.23That the corporeal component of man can be a danger to its spiritual counterpart, and that it is therefore wrong to love the body, is explicitly stated in the Poimandres:The one who recognizes himself has attained the overwhelming good, but the one who loved the body that came from the error of desire remains wandering in the dark and sensibly suffers the effects of death.24The author does not explicitly state that sexual desire (which he calls an error!) and death are the result of the splitting of humankind into males and females, but he apparently knew and probably favoured this idea. Perhaps we are justifi ed to quote here the Valentinian Gospel of Philip, at least if we follow the usual interpretation:When Eve was still in Adam death did not exist. When she was separated from him death came into being. When he enters [Paradise] again and attains his former self, death will be no more.25The same idea is expressed in the Gospel of Thomas:On the day that you were one [sc. in Paradise] you became two.26This implies that when the two become one again, that is to say, when the original androgyny is restored, Paradise is regained, as we read further on:23 Defi nitions IX, 4.24 CH I, 19.25 NHC II, 68, 22–26. I follow here the edition and translation by Isenberg, 178–179. H.-M. Schenke, Das Philippus-Evangelium, 47, presented a new interpretation and translation: “Als Eva mit Adam zusammen war, gab es keinen Tod. Als sie sich von ihm trennte, trat der Tot ins Dasein. Wenn er wieder hineingeht und er ihn bei sich aufnehmt, wird kein Tod mehr sein.” Because of the lacunal state of the manuscript, especially in the last sentence, and the possibility of textual corruption, the exact word-ing and meaning of this statement on the origin of death remains uncertain. Schenke’s argumentation in his commentary (391–393) does not convince me.26 Gospel of Thomas, log. 11."},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"8 roelof van den broekWhen you make the male and the female one and the same, so that the male not be male nor the female female, . . . then you will enter the Kingdom.27It seems that with respect to sexuality and procreation the author of the Poimandres took the same ambivalent stance as the Christian author Clement of Alexandria (ca. A.D. 200): procreation is good, but sexual desire is bad. Clement wrote in his Stromateis:Who has married to beget children should practise continence, so that he does not desire his own wife, whom he should love, begetting children with a chaste and virtuous will.28The AsclepiusIn the Poimandres, the androgyny of God and of the fi rst human beings entailed a negative view of sexual desire, which was seen as the cause of death. In the Asclepius, on the other hand, it led to a positive view of human intercourse, which was seen as an image of the divine androgyny. This does not mean, however, that the Asclepius was blind to the potential danger that the body poses for the soul. Two examples may suffi ce to show this:He [the human being] despises the human part of his nature, having put his trust in the divinity of his other part.29[Asclepius:] “According to your teaching thus far, Trismegistus, souls run a great risk in this earthly life regarding their hope of eternal life to come.”[ Trismegistus:] “Of course, but some fi nd this incredible, others fi cti-tious, others laughable perhaps. For in this bodily life the pleasure one takes from possessions is a delight, but this delight grips the soul by the throat, as they say: it clings to the mortal part of the human being and the malice that begrudges immortality does not allow him to get knowl-edge of his divine part.”30Nevertheless, the Asclepius has a positive view of sexuality and inter-course. Hermes’ remark in chapter 20 (quoted above) that God “is com-pletely full of the fertility of both sexes,” provokes a surprised question by Asclepius, in chapter 21: “Do you say that God is of both sexes, 27 Gospel of Thomas, log. 22.28 Clement, Stromateis III, 58, 2.29 Asclepius 6.30 Asclepius 12."},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":" hermetic and gnostic thought 9Trismegistus?” Hermes’ answer does not have to do with androgyny but with the fertility mentioned in his earlier remark:Not only God, Asclepius, but all kinds of life, whether endowed with soul or soulless. For it is impossible that any of the beings would be infertile. . . . For each sex is full of fecundity, and the linking of the two or, more accurately, their union is incomprehensible. If you call it Cupid or Venus or both, you will be correct.31He then proceeds to extol the incomprehensible mystery of sexual union. The mystery of procreation is accompanied by “the greatest affection, pleasure, gaiety, desire and love divine.” From this point onward, we fortunately have not only the Latin text, but also a Coptic translation included in the Nag Hammadi Library.32 This translation mostly gives us a better idea of the Greek original. But in this case it is diffi cult to establish the original wording:33,34CopticLatinAnd if you wish to see the reality of this mystery, then you should see the wonderful image of the intercourse that takes place between man and woman.33One should explain how great is the force and compulsion of this mystery, were it not that each individual, if he examines himself, already knows it from his inmost feelings.34The Coptic text says that sexual intercourse between humans is “a wonderful image” (it uses the Greek word eikōn) of the universal fecun-dity and productivity, which itself is a refl ection of the nature of the androgynous supreme being.After a graphic description of sexual intercourse, which is completely unique in classical literature, Hermes continues with an explanation of why this act of love is done in secret. In this case there are only minor differences between the Coptic and the Latin texts, in the latter of which we read:31 Asclepius 21.32 NHC VI, 65, 15–78, 43. The importance of the Coptic translation for our understanding of the whole passage on intercourse was fi rst pointed out by Mahé, “Le sens des symbols sexuels,” 126–133; see also his commentary in Hermès en Haute-Égypte, II, 209–214.33 NHC VI, 65, 15–19.34 Asclepius 21."},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"10 roelof van den broekTherefore, the act of this mystery, so sweet and vital, is done in secret. If it were done openly, the divinity that manifests itself in both natures from the mingling of the sexes would be forced to feel ashamed by the laughter of the ignorant; the more so, if it were open to the sight of irreverent people.35In the Coptic version, this is followed by a remark that once again emphasizes the mysterious nature of the sexual union:But they rather are holy mysteries of words and acts, because not only they are not heard but also not seen. Therefore, people of this kind [the ignorant and irreverent] are blasphemers, atheists and impious men.36It is of interest to note that the Asclepius here makes use of the language of the Greek mysteries: these consisted of sacred formulas (legomena) and sacred acts (drōmena) that had to be kept secret.37 Likewise, the sexual union of two lovers is a divine mystery, with sacred and secret words of love and a sacred and secret act. It is a divine mystery because it is not only “a wonderful image” of the productivity and the androgynous unity of God, but it also leads man and woman to the experience of their original androgyny. At the same time, the sexual union may have been seen as a symbol of the union of man’s inner self with God. But its meaning can only be grasped by those who have knowledge; for ignorant and irreverent people it is a mere act of the fl esh.There must be a direct connection between these hermetic views and those of the Valentinian Gnostics about the “marriage in purity” and the mystery of the bridal chamber, which are discussed by April DeConick elsewhere in this volume. Moreover, because of some distinct parallels with the hermetic views just discussed, it may be of interest to quote a scornful remark by Clement of Alexandria about the ideas of unspecifi ed Christian heretics concerning the mystical dimension of sexual intercourse:There are also people who call the vulgar Aphrodite38 a mystical union . . . For these thrice-unhappy39 people expound like hierophants the union of sexual intercourse as a mystery, and they are of the opinion that it leads them upwards into the Kingdom of God.4035 Asclepius 21.36 NHC VI, 65, 34–66, 2.37 This was pointed out by Dirkse and Parrott, Nag Hammadi Codices V, 2–5 and VI, 402.38 The term “vulgar Aphrodite” (= sexual intercourse) derives from Plato’s Symposium, 180c–185c; comp. “Venus” in Asclepius, 21.39 This term (Greek: trisathlioi ) might be a allusion to the epithet trismegistos of Hermes.40 Clement, Stromateis, III, 27, 1."},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":" hermetic and gnostic thought 11Finally, it should be observed that these hermetic (and gnostic) views on the androgyny of God and on sexual intercourse as its image and earthly realization presuppose the fundamental equality of both sexes, of man and woman—something quite exceptional in the Graeco-Roman world.The Gnostic Borborites and their Sexual Celebration of the EucharistThe Borborites, or Borborians, were a gnostic sect that fl ourished in the fourth century and reportedly survived at least up to the sixth century. Epiphanius of Salamis (ca. A.D. 380) has left us an extensive report on them in his Panarion, 26.41 They have attracted much scholarly atten-tion because their exceptional sexual practices seemed a clear example of the unbridled licentiousness of which the gnostics were accused by their opponents.42 According to Epiphanius, they were infl uenced by the teachings of another sect, that of the Nicolaitans,43 who are discussed in Panarion, 25, and whose founder Nicolaus is said to have taught: “Unless one copulates every day, one cannot have eternal life.”44 The Borborites called themselves “Gnostics” and “Enlightened,”45 but were also known as Phibionites, Stratiotics, Levitics, Secundians, Sokratites, Zachaeuses, Coddians and Barbelites.46 Since we have only Epiphanius’ testimony, we do not know to what extent these gnostic groups were really identical. The name Borborites means “fi lthy people,” which suggests that it was not a self-designation but a term of abuse invented by their adversaries. The so-called Anacephaleiosis, a very short epitome of the Panarion, of which Epiphanius’ authorship is disputed, suggests what may have prompted the name to Epiphanius himself or to others: “Yet others call them Borborites. These people take pride in Barbelo, 41 Greek text in Holl (ed.), Epiphanius, I, 275–300; English translations with notes in Williams, Panarion of Epiphanius, 82–99, and Layton, Gnostic Scriptures, 199–214. This section is an elaboration of the discussion in Van den Broek, “Borborites.”42 Benko, “The Libertine Gnostic Sect of the Phibionites”; Van den Broek, “Der Bericht des koptischen Kyrillos von Jerusalem; idem, “Borborites”; Fendt, “Borborianer”; Gero, “With Walter Bauer on the Tigris”; Jacobsen Buckley, “Libertines or Not”; Tar-dieu, “Epiphane contre les gnostiques”; Williams, Rethinking “Gnosticism,” 179–184.43 Epiphanius, Panarion, 26, 1, 3.44 Panarion, 25, 1, 6.

Epiphanius’ report makes it clear that the Borborites adhered to the specifi c form of Gnosticism that some scholars like to call “Sethian” and that is clearly related to that of the “Gnostics” in Irenaeus’ Adversus haereses,48 and in the Apocryphon of John and related texts.49The Borborites made use of many books, which, except for a few quotations by Epiphanius himself, are completely unknown to us: Noria, about Noah’s wife (cf.

NHC VII, 2: The Second Treatise of the Great Seth; NHC VII, 5: The Three Steles of Seth), Apocalypses of Adam (cf. NHC V, 5: The Apocalypse of Adam), the Birth of Mary, and the Gospel of Philip (a quotation, Panarion, 26, 13, 2–3, is not found in the Gospel of Philip of NHC II, 3).According to Epiphanius, the Borborites practised a curious Eucha-ristic ritual, in which instead of bread and wine male semen and female menstrual blood were offered up and eaten by the participants. Epiphanius reports about the ritual of the male emission:To extend their blasphemy to heaven after making love in a state of fornication, the woman and the man receive the male emission in their own hands. And they stand with their eyes raised heavenward but the fi lth in their hands, and of course they pray—the ones called Stratiotics and Gnostics—and offer that stuff in their hands to the actual Father of all, and say, “We offer unto you this gift, the body of Christ.” And then they eat it and partake of their own dirt, and they say: “This is the body of Christ; and this is the Passover, because of which our bodies suffer ( paskhei ) and are forced to confess the passion ( pathos) of Christ.”50The last remark shows that the Borborites considered the sexual passion a form of suffering, which they compared to the passion of Christ. Fol-lowing a common Christian interpretation, they connected the Hebrew word Pascha (Passover) with the Greek verb paskhein, “to suffer” and the substantive pathos, “passion.”5147 Epiphanius, Anacephaleiosis, 26.48 Irenaeus, Adv.

They likewise take the unclean menstrual blood they gather from her, and eat it in common. And “This”, they say, “is the blood of Christ.” And thus when they read in apocryphal writings: “I saw a tree bearing fruit twelve times a year, and he said to me, ‘This is the tree of life,’ ” they interpret this allegorically of the woman’s monthly emissions.52The rationale behind this ritual seems to be that the divine element in human beings is located in their procreative power and that, therefore, salvation is realized by the emission of the bodily fl uids, which are then offered to God. Epiphanius comments: “The idea is that they can obtain ready access to God through such a practice.”53 In the section on the Nicolaitans, Epiphanius mentions a Gnostic myth about Barbelo, which according to him was popular among the Borborites. According to this myth, she keeps appearing to the archons in a beautiful form and “through their lust-caused ejaculation robs them of their seed—to recover . . . her power.”54 Epiphanius refers to the Borborites when he says that some of the followers of Nicolaus said: “We gather the power of Prunicus [i.e. Barbelo] from our bodies through their emissions.”55 In the book called Noria, Noah’s wife Noria revealed both the powers on high and Barbelo: “and she intimated that what has been taken from the Mother on high by the archon who made the world . . . must be gathered from the power in bodies, through the male and female emissions.”56 Elsewhere, the divine element that has to be rescued from the fl esh (which belongs to the bad ruler of this world and can-not be raised) is said to be the soul: “But the power in the menses and semen, they say, is soul ‘which we gather and eat.’ ”57 According to the Greater Questions of Mary, it was Jesus himself who had introduced the Borborite ritual: in the presence of Mary (probably Mary Magdalen) he produced a woman from his side, began to have intercourse with her, and partook of his emission to show that “Thus we must do, that we may live.”5852 Panarion, 26, 4, 8–5, 1.53 Panarion, 26, 5, 7.54 Panarion, 25, 2, 4.55 Panarion, 25, 3, 2.56 Panarion, 26, 1, 9.57 Panarion, 26, 9, 3–4.58 Panarion, 26, 8, 2–3."},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"14 roelof van den broekIt seems that the Borborites explained various texts which spoke about “gathering” the divine element in humanity as referring to their own practice. Epiphanius transmits an interesting passage from the Gospel of Eve that describes a revelation by a tall heavenly fi gure, who is accompanied by another person of small stature and says to the visionary, probably Eve:I am you and you are me, and wherever you are, there I am. And I am sown in all things, and you gather me from wherever you wish. But when you gather me, you gather yourself.59This need not imply that the Gospel of Eve taught the strange eucharistic ritual of the Borborites. Most probably they simply interpreted the pas-sage in this sense, just as they did with a whole set of biblical texts.60 To give a sample of their biblical exegesis, it may suffi ce to quote what Epiphanius has to say about their interpretation of Psalm 1: And when David says: “He shall be like a tree planted by the outlets of water that will bring forth its fruit in due season,” he speaks about the man’s dirty behaviour. “By the outgoings of water” and “that will bring forth its fruit,” means the emission at climax. And “Its leaf shall not fall off ” means “We do not allow it to fall to the ground, but eat it ourselves.”61In his description of the Borborites, Epiphanius puts all the emphasis on their unbridled licentiousness and promiscuity. Interestingly, he ascribes to them a secret sign of recognition: And if a stranger who is of their persuasion arrives, they have a sign that men give women and women give men: when the hand is held out, in greeting of course, a tickling stroke is made in the palm of the hand, so as to indicate secretly that the visitor is of their religion.62According to Epiphanius, they rejected fasting63 and asceticism,64 but forbade procreation65 and called the female members of the sect “Virgins.”66 To leave their “virginity” intact, they practised coitus 59 Panarion, 26, 3, 1.60 Panarion, 26, 6, 1–2; 8, 4–7; 11, 1–2.61 Panarion, 26, 8, 7.62 Panarion, 26, 4, 2.63 Panarion, 26, 5, 8.64 Panarion, 26, 13, 1.65 Panarion, 26, 5, 12.66 Panarion, 26, 11, 9."},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":" hermetic and gnostic thought 15interruptus,67 and when a woman accidentally became pregnant they aborted the foetus, prepared it with honey, spices and aromatics, ate it, and prayed to God: “We have not been deceived by the archon of lust, but we have gathered the brother’s transgression.”68 A special group, which they called “Levites,” and who may have been the same as the “Levitics,” practised homosexuality.69Epiphanius claims to have come across this sect when he lived in Egypt, about A.D. 330. He was instructed in their teachings, he says, by active members of the group, who in fact were beautiful young women who tried to seduce and convert him.70 They were disappointed about his refusal and said to each other: “We have been unable to save the young man, but we have left him in the hands of the archon to per-ish!”71 After reading their books and understanding their true intent, Epiphanius reported them to “the bishops in that place,”72 and did his best “to fi nd out the names of those who were hidden in the church. And so they were expelled from the city, about eighty persons.”73 He obviously did not participate in the sexual orgies of which he gives such a detailed description. Note that the instruction by the beautiful female adherents of the sect was apparently not very specifi c, since he understood their true intent only after reading their books.For a correct assessment of the evidence presented above, the all-important question is: how trustworthy is our source? Epiphanius was famous for his learning and his zeal for ecclesiastical orthodoxy. He intended his Panarion, or Medicine Chest, as an antidote for those who had been bitten by the serpent of heresy. The Panarion is indispensable because of the many and sometimes excellent sources Epiphanius quotes or makes use of, but at the same time its value is very much restricted by the fact that he is obviously incapable of handling his sources. His 67 Panarion, 26, 11, 9–11.68 Panarion, 26, 5, 4–6.69 Panarion, 26, 13, 1.70 Panarion, 26, 17, 4; 18, 2.71 Panarion, 26, 17, 6.72 This might be an indication that the incident did not occur in Alexandria but elsewhere in Egypt. In Alexandria, there was only one bishop at that time (Athanasius, 328–373, with interruptions). The “bishops” (episkopoi, literally “overseers,” “supervi-sors”) are probably the local college of presbyters and teachers, which in the second century played an important part in the church of Alexandria itself and afterwards continued to exist in the Egyptian Chora for a long time; see for this my study “Juden und Christen in Alexandrien im 2. und 3.

It is no wonder that scholars have reached sometimes completely divergent opinions about the gnostic and other sects that are dealt with in the Panarion. In short, reading Epiphanius’ work is mostly frustrating and often unrewarding, and yet it cannot be ignored.As for the reliability of his report about the Borborites, scholarly opin-ion is divided and ranges from almost complete trust in its reliability74 to almost complete rejection.75 Of course, Epiphanius’ anti-heretical zeal may have induced him to give free play to his imagination, but there are reasons to assume that his report is not completely unreliable. Two Gnostic texts, both earlier than Epiphanius’ Panarion, explicitly condemn similar practices.76 In the Pistis Sophia, Thomas says to Jesus: We have heard that there are some upon the earth who take male semen and female menstrual blood and make a dish of lentils and eat it, saying: “We believe in Esau and Jacob.” Is this then a seemly thing or not?At that moment, Jesus was angry with the world and he said to Thomas: “Truly I say that this sin surpasses every sin and every iniquity. Men of this kind will be taken immediately to the outer darkness, and will not be returned again into the sphere.”77And in the Second Book of Jeu, Jesus forbids his disciples to reveal the mysteries to, inter alios, those who serve the 72 evil archons:neither give them to those who serve the eighth power of the great Archon, i.e. those who eat the menstrual blood of their impurity and the semen of men, saying: “We have come to true knowledge and pray to the true God.” Their God, however, is bad.7874 Thus Benko, “Libertine Gnostic Sect”, and Gero, “With Walter Bauer on the Tigris.”75 Thus Williams, Rethinking “Gnosticism,” 179–184; cf. 181–182: “what we are left with are people who are members of the Christian community (they were ‘hidden within the church’); who may also have had additional, secret worship services that were more or less cloaked from the eyes of the uninitiated; who turn out to possess secret books with suspicious theological language; and who want to be known as ‘virgins’ ” According to Williams, all the rest was made up by Epiphanius himself.76 According to Tardieu, Introduction à la littérature gnostique, 80 and 90, the Pistis Sophia and the Books of Jeû were composed around A.D. 330. In my view, there are good reasons to suppose that they were written in the second half of the third century; see van den Broek, “Gnosticism II: Gnostic literature,” 418.77 Pistis Sophia, 147.78 Second Book of Jeu, 43."},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":" hermetic and gnostic thought 17It has been objected that these texts are “once again polemical accusa-tions, not advocacy by practitioners,”79 but that does not exclude the possibility that there may have been some truth in these allegations. Religiously-inspired sexual rituals, which to outsiders look like sheer obscenities, are not uncommon in the history of religions.80 Admit-tedly, there are no independent testimonies from adherents of the cult itself, but the esoteric and secret character of its rituals makes it very unlikely that such testimonies ever existed. Moreover, it may be doubted whether any practitioner of such rituals would be willing to reveal their exact nature to non-initiated outsiders. In fact, the scholars who completely reject Epiphanius’ report seem to be unable to imagine that such rituals can be practiced in reality. In my view, there is no reason to push Epiphanius’ testimony completely aside and to deny that the “gathering” of the divine seed by means of sexual rituals was possibly an important element in the Borborite cult. Its starting-point may have been the fact, as attested by many Gnostic texts, that the divine element in human beings that has to be gathered during the process of salvation was often metaphorically called semen.81 It seems quite plausible that some gnostics may have taken the term literally and hence developed practices as described by Epiphanius. Of course, this does not mean that we need to take Epiphanius’ report at face value; on the contrary, we may assume that in this case as well we are dealing with the same mixture of truth, hearsay, misunderstanding and sheer slan-der that so often characterizes his anti-heretical polemics. What seems certain is that the Borborites, who called themselves “Gnostics,” were an offshoot of the “Gnostics” who adhered to the system described in Irenaeus, Adversus Haereses, I, 29 and the Apocryphon of John. They most probably distinguished themselves from other gnostic sects by a literal interpretation of the metaphor “semen” as an indication of the divine element in humankind, which led them to the idea that salvation is realized when the bodily fl uids of man and woman are “saved” and offered to God.About the later vicissitudes of the Borborites our sources are not much more helpful than the report by Epiphanius. According to a number of Syriac, Armenian, Coptic and Arabic texts, the Borborites survived 79 Williams, Rethinking “Gnosticism,” 184.80 See e.g. White, Kiss of the Yogini; Urban, Tantra. For more recent western examples, see the chapters by Marco Pasi and Hans Thomas Hakl in this volume.81 For a discussion of the pneumatic seeds according to the Valentinians, see April DeConick’s chapter in this volume."},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"18 roelof van den broektenaciously in the Christian Near East.82 They are said to have lived in Southern Asia Minor, Armenia and Syria. In imperial legislation they are mentioned from the fi fth century onward: they are forbidden to build churches and to hold religious services. Unfortunately, these sources provide little information on the ideas and practices of these later Borborites, and when they do become more specifi c the infl uence of Epiphanius’ report is unmistakable. According to the sixth-century author Baradbešabba, the Borborites believed that angels had created the world, and he writes that their central rite consisted of the ritual defi lement of ten virgins by the priests of the sect. If one of these got pregnant, she was worshipped “in the place of Mary” and her fetus was sacramentally consumed:83 the child was apparently identi-fi ed with the body of Christ and the woman with the Virgin Mary. In fact there are other testimonies that some groups that are called Borborites by their opponents held the Virgin Mary in high esteem and even attributed divine status to her. According to some sources, she had a heavenly body, but according to others she was a heavenly power or even a goddess, so that she and her Son were two divinities next to God—a view already refuted in the Koran, Sura 5, 116. These views, which can be traced back to the fourth and the fi fth centuries, eventually infl uenced the Bogomile and Cathar doctrine of Mary as a heavenly power. The strong emphasis that Epiphanius put on the sexual rituals of the Borborites has obviously obscured other aspects of their belief system, one of which may have been the exaltation of the Virgin Mary to a divine status.84ConclusionAn analysis of the hermetic views on sexuality and sex demonstrates, once again, the great variety of opinions and practices that went under the umbrella of ancient Hermetism. There was a general consensus about the passions of the body being a great danger to the soul; and in this respect the hermetists agreed with the Gnostics and many Greek philosophers, especially those of the platonic type. But with respect 82 See Gero, “With Walter Bauer on the Tigris”, 292–303 for much information on this point.83 Nau (ed.), La première partie de l’Histoire de Baradbešabba {Arbaia, 190–191.84 See van den Broek, “Der Bericht des koptische Kyrillos von Jerusalem.”"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":" hermetic and gnostic thought 19to the sexual passion specifi cally, the hermetic ideas show considerable variation. The Poimandres states explicitly that androgyny is the ideal sexual state, as exemplifi ed by the supreme God and the fi rst human beings. The splitting up of humanity into males and females led to sexual desire and intercourse, which was necessary for the propagation of the human race but also became the cause of death. The author speaks of the “error of desire” due to which the body came into exis-tence. Only the one who has recognized his own immortality, that is to say, who knows his divine descent, will be able to return to his origin; otherwise, he remains “wandering in the dark and sensibly suffers the effects of death.” The Asclepius, however, wholeheartedly admits that the act of love is accompanied by “the greatest affection, pleasure, gaiety, desire and love divine,” and that it is “sweet and vital.” But the union of the sexes is a divine mystery, which must be enacted in secret, so that it will not be exposed to ridicule by ignorant (inperiti ) and irreverent (inreligiosi ) people. The man and woman who have sexual intercourse perform “holy mysteries of words and acts,” which are neither heard nor seen. People who ridicule this hermetic mystery of the sexual union are “blasphemers, atheists and impious men.” These expressions show that the author of the Asclepius assigned a religious and even esoteric meaning to the act of love-making. He speaks of the “divinity of both natures” (divinitas utriusque naturae) that is manifested from the mingling of the sexes. It is a “wonderful image” of God’s androgynous fertility and productivity. This means that in their sexual union a man and a woman come as close to their original androgynous unity as is possible under earthly conditions. Within the gnostic current, there was likewise a variety of opinions about sexuality and sexual intercourse, as is the case for so many other points of doctrine and practice within this movement. According to the sources, many Gnostics condemned the sexual drive as one of the bad demiurge’s most effective means of making the soul a slave to the body. But there were Gnostics who had a more positive view of sexual intercourse, as exemplifi ed by the Borborites discussed above and the Valentinians studied by April DeConick elsewhere in this volume. Starting from the same concept of a pneumatic seed present in human beings, the Borborites developed views and practices that are completely different from those of the Valentinians. The latter condoned and even propagated sex and procreation within a “pure marriage” in order to ensure the implantation of the pneumatic seed in the souls of children that would be superior both spiritually and morally and so could be"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"20 roelof van den broeksaved more easily than others. The Borborites rejected the begetting of children, but they believed that the male and female sexual emissions contained what the Valentinians called the “pneumatic seed,” and that this seed had to be offered to God. That, they believed, was the esoteric meaning of the Eucharist, as taught by Jesus himself.BibliographyBenko, S., “The Libertine Gnostic Sect of the Phibionites according to Epiphanius,” Vigiliae Christanae 21, 1967. 103–119.Broek, R. van den, Studies in Gnosticism and Alexandrian Christianity (Nag Hammadi and Manichaean Studies, XXXI).

DeConickValentinian thought and practices have been the subject of countless academic studies even prior to the discovery of the Nag Hammadi collection in 1945. In this literature, the Valentinians were character-ized as elitist Gnostics who believed in the certainty of their salvation due to the existence of a particle of spirit within them, a “seed” which guaranteed the acquisition of gnosis. Due in part to their characteriza-tion as spiritual snobs and intellectual egotists, they have been portrayed either as libertines who believed that they could claim a certain sexual freedom denied to other Christians, or as conservatives who embraced celibacy for fear that they might be tainted by sexual pollution.These understandings of Valentinianism were developed largely on the basis of the accounts penned by the heresiologists. However, they have persisted even after the discovery of the Nag Hammadi materials, although the latter provide us with a rich mine of information that calls these opinions into question. Actually Valentinian gnostic Christians had a highly-developed consciousness of the sacred when it came to sexual practices: one which revered the marital bed but reserved it for the advanced Christian, the gnostic Christian, and maintained that all others, Christians and non-Christians, should forsake it. This belief developed out of a certain anthropology and understanding of con-ception which saw the sexual act as the sacred life-giving moment at which time the Spirit of God joined with the souls of the parents and produced a child. Through contemplative sexual practices, the Valen-tinians hoped to conceive children whose souls would contain an elect or morally-inclined “seed” of the Spirit. Sacred marriage was essential for giving birth to such children, who in turn would bring about the redemption of the fallen Sophia and the psyche.Initial ConsiderationsIn order to understand Valentinian theology and sociology, we fi rst have to get rid of a number of outdated defi nitions and assumptions which lead to distortions of the historical evidence.

In fact, it has become increasingly clear that “Gnosticism” is a modern typological construct based upon heresiological stereotypes and is misleading as a descriptor of historical reality.1 Scholars have come to realize that traditional concepts of Gnosticism and its corol-laries (as summed up in 1966 at the fi rst colloquium on Gnosticism, in Messina)2 were built on circular assumptions, leading to the erroneous idea of a kind of umbrella religion covering a variety of “deviant” groups in antiquity. The term “Gnosticism” came to stand for a form of religiosity characterized by a negative view of the cosmos and human existence, refl ecting a feeling of nihilism contrasted with the yearn-ing for a spiritual reality. On those premises, a variety of Hermetic, apocalyptic, mystical, and encratic traditions lost their distinctiveness and were subsumed under one and the same gnostic umbrella. In fact, the Valentinians defi ned themselves as Christians, as active members of the Christian Church.3 This was their self-consciousness and self-identification. How can one ignore the fact that Valen-tinus himself was only narrowly defeated in his bid to become Bishop of Rome in the mid-second century, and that he was considered a leading theologian and brilliant exegete at the time?4 In fact, Tertul-1 Williams, Rethinking “Gnosticism”; Markschies, Gnosis; King, What is Gnosticism?2 Bianchi, Origini dello Gnosticismo, XXVI–XXIX.3 Cf.

Phil. 52.25; 62.31.4 Markschies’ attempt in his Valentinus Gnosticus? to distance Valentinus from Gnosti-cism would seem to be pointing in the right direction, if it weren’t for the fact that he does so by arguing that Valentinus’ fragments do not contain teaching about a Demi-urge and other mythological elements commonly associated with Gnosticism. Thus, his studious book only serves to reinforce the problem of interpretation. Particularly problematic is Markschies’ exclusion of patristic comments on Valentinus’ opinions, which seems to be done only because it serves Markschies’ purpose, but at the price of founding his reconstruction of Valentinus’ ideas on only a few fragments that do not allow for a complete picture. In my opinion, since Gnosticism is a modern typological construct, it is inaccurate to characterize Valentinus as either a gnostic heretic or an orthodox theologian. If one takes into account partristic comments as well as Valen-tinus’ own fragments, it is more accurate to characterize him as an esoteric Christian who began welding a Jewish-Platonic mythology about the origins of the world that included a Demiurge, the concept of divine emanation, and angelic involvement in the creation of the human being. He believed that he and those who followed his teachings were privy to a gnosis of the heart, the experience of God indwelling their souls. This teaching was not considered heretical during his lifetime but fi t in quite well with the teachings of other Alexandrians like Clement and Origen. This teaching continued to be developed by Valentinus’ students and eventually came to be considered hereti-cal by the Church, although not during his lifetime. I would consider it impossible to think that Valentinus did not teach a Demiurgic myth, given the fact that his four"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"  conceiving  spirits  25lian even uses the words “genius” and “eloquent” to describe him.5Valentinus and his students did not create their own churches, like the Marcionites, but instead attended ordinary services along with other Christians. In addition to this, however, they also met as a type of “secret society” in a lodge or theological school.6 It appears that, along with many Alexandrian Christians, they were of the opinion that Christianity consisted of different degrees, ranging from the neophyte to the initiated. Those who studied the teachings of Valentinus considered themselves to be among the initiated, privy to the esoteric teachings of the Church. They appear to have been very successful not only as teachers, but also as ministers of the churches. One refl ection of this is the homily known as the Interpretation of Knowledge (NHC XI, 1), delivered by a follower of Valentinus to his church. In his address, this minister preaches to initiated and ordinary Christian alike, since both are part of his fl ock. Furthermore, Irenaeus tells us that a certain Marcus was a very popular minister in town, and that this made Irenaeus very upset since Marcus was gaining members at his expense, in particular one of his own deacon’s wives!7The Valentinians distinguished themselves from the ordinary Chris-tian by their claim to a certain gnosis, which could only be gained through esoteric study and practices. Thus, it is more accurate to call the Valentinians “gnostic Christians” than “Christian Gnostics”. For some strange reason, most scholars have misunderstood the Valentin-ian call for gnosis as a call for pursuing intellectual and philosophi-cal knowledge when, in fact, this could not be any further from the crux of the matter. What is the gnosis that they seek? In the Gospel of Truth, Jesus, who is called “knowledge and perfection,” proclaims “the things that are in the heart” (het),8 which he has received from the Father, as “the fruit [of ] his heart (het) and an impression of his will.”9 Jesus speaks “what is in the heart (het) of the Father,”10 students (Theodotus, Heracleon, Ptolemy, and Marcus), who were all from different geographical locations, taught striking similar versions of a Demiurgic myth. These cannot represent independent developments. 5 Tertullian, Adv. Val. 4. 6 Tertullian, Adv.

In his book, The Intercourse of Friends, he writes, “The law written in the heart (kardia) is the people of the Beloved—loved and loving him.”12 The gnosis they seek is “knowl-edge-how.” It is experiential, and concerns mystical union with the divine, based on the love between their souls and God. This is not to say that the pursuit of epistemological knowledge or “knowledge-that” was not vital to salvation. The Valentinians consid-ered it important enough to write volumes of exegetical treatises and theological books exploring the nature of God and the human being, materials which they studied and discussed among themselves. In so doing, they incorporated and developed along Christian lines a Jew-ish-Platonic mythology about the origins of the world that included a Demiurge and the concept of divine emanation. But, like the Her-metists, the Valentinians thought that the pursuit of “knowledge-that” could only advance a person up to a certain point spiritually.13 The pinnacle of the spiritual journey was not “thinking about God,” but the direct experience or “gnosis” of the Ultimate Reality, a Reality beyond the concept or idea of that Reality.14The Valentinians, however, differed from the Hermetists and Jewish mystics in their insistence that this direct experience of God was impos-sible to achieve during one’s lifetime as a human being. The best that one could hope for was a mediated experience of the Father through his Son, Jesus. In this, they were faithful exegetes of the Gospel of John. It was only on the eschatological plateau that direct vision and union with the Father was possible. And it was this fi nal, ultimate experience that the Valentinians prepared for during their lifetimes.The Psyche and the Dissemination of Pneumatic SeedsThere is no consensus among scholars about what is meant exactly by the dispersion of the pneumatic seeds, although when the subject is broached, it is usually connected to the Valentinian trifurcation of 11 Gospel of Truth 32.32–35. For the previous quotations see Attridge, Nag Hammadi Codex I, 87, 92, 100, 102.12 Clement of Alexandria, Strom. 6.6, in Stählin, Clemens, 458.13 See e.g. CH IX, 10; X, 5–6.14 Prayer of Thanksgiving 64.8–65.2."},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"  conceiving  spirits  27human beings into pneumatics, psychics, and hylics (standing for spirit, soul, and matter).15 Although academic discussions on this subject are confusing, they leave the impression that only the pneumatics are born with spiritual seeds and are completely redeemed in the End. This, however, seems to be based upon a misreading of Irenaeus’ interpreta-tion of the three natures of people. He writes:They conceive then of three kinds of humans, pneumatic, and psychic, and material represented by Cain, Abel, and Seth. These three natures are no longer found in one person, but constitute various kinds. The material goes, as a matter of course, into corruption. The psychic, if it chooses the better part, will rest in the intermediate place. But if [it chooses] the worse, it too shall pass into destruction. But they assert that the pneumatic elements which have been sown by Achamoth, being dis-ciplined and nourished here from that time until now in righteous souls (because when given forth by her they were yet but weak), at last attaining perfection, shall be given as brides to the angels of the Savior, while their souls of necessity, rest for ever with the Demiurge in the intermediate place. And again subdividing the souls themselves, they say that some are by nature good, and others by nature evil. The good are those who become capable of receiving the seed; the evil by nature are those who are never able to receive that seed. (Adv. haer. 1.7.5)16Irenaeus tells us that the natures are represented by Cain, Abel, and Seth, respectively. He continues by saying that the material people fall into corruption. The psychic people, if they are morally good, will fi nd rest in a place just outside the Pleroma, while those who are morally evil will be destroyed. Then he talks about the spiritual seeds sown in righteous souls, attaining to perfection as the brides of Jesus’ angels.He would therefore seem to equate this last category with the spiritual people. However, if one reads on, this picture becomes clouded since he states that their souls will rest outside the Pleroma and are subdivided into those who are by nature good and those who are evil. The good can receive a spiritual seed, while the evil cannot. These cannot be the pneumatics, as Irenaeus leads us to believe (see also 1.7.1).15 For discussions of this topic, see Pagels, “Confl icting Version of Valentinian Eschatology,” 35–53; McCue, “Confl icting Version of Valentinianism?” 404–416; Buckley, Female Fault and Fulfi lment in Gnosticism, 61–83. The publication of Thomassen, The Spiritual Seed: The Church of the ‘Valentinians,’ came too late for me to incorporate in my discussion. But like other scholars, Thomassen identifi es only the Valentinians as bearers of the spiritual seed.16 Rousseau and Doutreleau, Irénée de Lyon, 110–112; Eng. trans. mine."},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"28 april d. deconickTo explain this, we might assume that Irenaeus is confl ating two separate traditions in this passage. He knows a tradition about the trifurcation of humanity, and he also knows a tradition about the dual-ity of the psychics: those who live righteously, and those who do not, those who are saved through their works, and those who are not.17 If the passage is read in this light, it suggests that “righteous souls” sown with spiritual seeds refers to the psychics, and that the choice that a psychic makes determines whether such a person will become a bride of the angel or be doomed to destruction as a hylic. If this is the case, then the Valentinians were saying that every soul is born with a spiritual seed or the potential to receive one. Could this be the solution?We might fi nd the answer by investigating the function of the spir-itual seed. According to the Valentinians, it is the spirit that animates or gives life to the human being.18 They speak of the inner core of the soul as the “spirit,” which exists as an embedded “seed.” These spiritual seeds are said to be the “marrow” of the soul.19 They are the factor in the human being that binds the soul to the body and makes possible a composite being. Thus the seeds are likened to “leaven,” since it is by them that two different substances are welded into one single being.20 Now if this is indeed the function of the spiritual seed, then the Val-entinians must have believed that everyone contained this element, or else some humans would not be able to function as a human being.To make matters more complicated, the spiritual seed was also described as the “divine” dimension of the soul in contrast to the “material” or hylic dimension. The hylic dimension of the soul was considered a “tare” that corrupted the soul and eventually needed to be pulled out. It was also envisioned as a “seed of the devil,” since it was made of the same substance (homoousios) as the devil.21 The idea appears to have been that this demonic seed or spirit naturally corrupted every soul as it descended into the body, something hinted at in Valentinus’ letter preserved by Clement. In this letter, he discusses the descent of the soul and the appendages or spirits that have attached themselves to it. He worries that in the core of the soul, the “heart,” (kardia) certain evil spirits have come to dwell. This state he considers the natural state 17 For those two traditions, see Adv. haer. 1.7.5 and 1.6.4 respectively.18 Exegesis of the Soul 133.31–134.5.19 Exc.

In rabbinic tradition, this is known as the doctrine of the two yeserim, or two inclinations.26 The place of the yeser is in the heart, and it derives from the time of the fi rst human being.27 In the Qumran community, these “inclinations” were called “spirits,”28 and it is likewise in the Epistle of Barnabas and the Testament of Judah.29 The Shepherd of Hermas and the Pseudo-Clementine Homilies30 call these spirits “angels.” All this, of course, echoes the ancient assumption that certain spirits or demons invade the soul and make it suffer with passions.31Baptism was considered necessary in order to remove the demons, and unction to install the Holy Spirit—the most powerful divine spirit, which would help to guard the soul from future demonic invasion.32 In fact, Valentinus himself states that “so long as the soul remains impure, it serves as an abode for many demons.”33 Further on in the same fragment, he writes that only the indwelling of the Son and the 22 Clement, Strom. 2.20 in Stählin, Clemens Alexandrinu, 175.23 Exeg.

Certainly this is a reference to unction. This is also the picture of the soul presented in The Exegesis on the Soul: “when she fell down into a body and came to this life, then she fell into the hands of many robbers, and wanton creatures passed her from one to another . . . they defi led her.”34 When the Father sees her in this defi led condition, he has mercy on her35 and saves her through baptism and anointing, the “light of salvation.”36Things become even more complicated because, as it appears to me, the Valentinians did not believe that all spiritual seeds were equal. Some were superior to others. When describing the various aspects of the human being, the Tripartite Tractate states that although the “spiritual substance is a single thing and a single representation,” it takes variable “forms” that are determined by its “weakness.”37 The psychic or soul substance is said to have a “double” aspect, inclined toward the good but fi ghting with the material body, which is weakest of all substances, thwarting the soul and driving it toward evil with its “many types of inclination.”38In the Extracts of Theodotus, this variation among the spiritual seeds is explained metaphorically in terms of gender.39 Clement tells us that the Valentinians considered the begetting of the spiritual seed to be Sophia’s “fi nest emanation:” an interpretation of Genesis 1:27, “He created them in the image of God, male and female he created them.”40 This birthing of the “fi nest emanation” occurred at the moment when Sophia gazed with delight upon the tribe of dazzling angels who attended Jesus in his descent from the Pleroma.41 The males are destined to become the spirits of the “elect,” including the prophets,42 while the females are fated to become the spirits of the “called,” members of the Christian Church.4334 Exegesis of the soul 127.25–32.35 Ibid., 128.26–129.5.36 Ibid., 131.27–132.2; 135.26–30, in Layton, Nag Hammadi Codex II,2–7, volume 2, 144, 146, 154, 162.37 Tripartite Tractate 106.6–10.38 Tripartite Tractate 106.10–18 in Attridge, Nag Hammadi Codex I, 284.39 Cf.

That is to say, they are not conscious or mature. The Savior has come to awaken and initiate their maturation process. Hence the type of spiritual seed a person possessed could be identi-fi ed by his or her reaction to conversion to Christianity.44 Souls with Elect or male seeds are said to be the souls of those Christians who immediately rush to embrace Jesus when they hear his voice. These are the “pneumatics.” Those who hesitate but eventually are converted to the Christian faith have Called or female seeds and are known as “psychics.” Baptism and unction are necessary for both groups since the demonic spirits that naturally corrupt the soul must be expelled, leaving a pure or clean heart for the Holy Spirit to indwell. In fact, the Valentinians thought that the Holy Spirit actually “mixed” with the spiritual seed, the heart of the soul, similar to what happens when a child is conceived from the mixture of two seeds in the womb.45 In each soul, the Holy Spirit is on guard against future demonic invasion, and is “kindling” the seed, that is to say, giving it “life.”46The difference between the two gendered spiritual seeds is that the male seed is superior, containing within it already the “blueprint,” so to speak, of the Image of God. Hence it can naturally grow and transform the soul, from the heart outwards, into that glorious Image. This is what is meant when the Valentinians teach that the pneumatics are “saved” by their nature. The female seed, however, contains a less perfect “blueprint” of God’s Image, a “female” refl ection of it. So more work is needed to bring it into the perfected transformed state, that is to say, to make the female into a male. In order for the soul to be thus transformed, it has to devote itself to righteous living in imitation of Jesus’ piety. This is what the Valentinians mean when they say that the psychics are saved through piety and good works. I might add here that both seeds were believed to benefi t from the eucharist, which brought the soul into conformity with God’s Image, because the person was ingesting the divine man, in their words, the “Perfect Man” Jesus.Sadly, however, if a seed was female, this meant that there was also the potential for continued tragedy.

In the case of the hylics, the third group of humans, these souls lost the battle against their demons. The Holy Spirit never infused them, and their spiritual seeds withered and died among the “tares.” Thus the Valentinians believed that these people would be destroyed at the Eschaton.Contrary to what has long been thought, the Valentinians were not elitists concerned only about their own salvation. On the contrary, their concern was for the entire Christian Church, and this is what they were trying to explain by means of their mythology. They were brilliant exegetes, particularly of the Gospel of John and the letters of Paul.47 They wished to explain Paul’s concept of universal salvation, while also taking into account his mention of those “predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son.”48 They believed wholeheartedly in the grace of God and his love, from which all believers, gnostic Christians and ordinary Christians alike, would never be separated.The Valentinians were not focused on their own election as those who uniquely embodied spiritual seeds. Rather they worried over the integra-tion of spirit and soul during the time that the soul or psyche suffered in an embodied state of exile, fi lth, and corruption. The systematic theol-ogy of the Valentinians seems to me to have been developed around this core belief. Its starting point is the human condition, the material body and soul. Even though the Valentinians were of the opinion that the soul had fallen into a corrupt state, they did not believe that it was completely lost or estranged from God. In fact, the main point of their mythology appears to have been the teaching that some type of “seed” of the spirit dwells in every soul, and that the spirit is therefore integral to the human soul even in its corrupt state, because it enlivens the soul and integrates it with the body.They were teaching that the Real Self in not the physical body nor the rational soul, but a deeper aspect of the person, an aspect of the heart, an inner core of the soul. This Self was God in Exile. It needed to be awakened and cultivated. It needed to be transformed from its germinal state into a glorious being so that it could be united with its angelic twin. Finally it could become whole through marriage in the great eschatological Bridal Chamber, the Pleroma itself, on the Last Day. It is in these beautiful terms that its homecoming was imagined.47 Pagels, The Johannine Gospel in Gnostic Exegesis; Pagels, The Gnostic Paul; Pagels, “The Mystery of the Resurrection,” 276–288; Pagels, “The Valentinian Claim to Esoteric Exegesis,” 241–258.48 Romans 8:29."},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"  conceiving  spirits  33Spiritual Intercourse49As we have seen, the Valentinians taught that the soul’s condition is pre-existent, and that from the time of its creation it already contains two seeds, one spiritual and one demonic. Thus Clement remarks that they believed that the human soul consists of three substances: a pneumatic seed (which in some writings was understood to be either “male” or “female”) and a demonic seed that infused the psychic substance.50 Over this human soul was laid the human body, the “garments of leather” mentioned in the Genesis story.Explaining the creation of Adam, the fi rst human, along these lines was of particular importance to the Valentinians. They taught that Sophia had planted the male spiritual seed in Adam and the female in Eve. But this spiritual seed laid dormant, sleeping: a reference to Adam’s fall into a deep sleep before Eve (along with the female seed) was cut from his side.51 In fact, Valentinus himself explained in a letter that the angels were afraid of the fi rst human being because of “the being in him who had invisibly communicated a germ of the supernal essence.” This being was “the pre-existent man.” So the angels “speed-ily marred the work,” apparently by enfl eshing it, a process which involved its further descent and degradation through the appropriation of demonic spirits.52This is the juncture in the story where the Valentinians saw tragedy, and this tragedy concerns the immediate subject of the present volume: sex. We are informed by the Church Fathers on several occasions that according to the Valentinians, three natures were produced by Adam: the irrational one represented by his offspring Cain (hylics), the ratio-nal one represented by his son Abel (psychics), and the spiritual one represented by Seth (pneumatics).53 This trifurcation was tragic, we are told, due to the unfortunate fact that Adam acted sexually out of his material nature as well as out of his spiritual and psychic aspects.54 Adam’s sexual behavior determined the type of spiritual seed the soul received: an elect seed (Seth) or a less mature seed (Cain and Abel).

What exactly did Adam do to cause that situation? The answer to this question depends upon our understanding of Valentinian attitudes toward marriage, sex, and procreation. In my previous publications on that subject, I was under the false impression that the Valentinians taught only the infusion of spiritual seeds in their own souls, rather than in those of all human beings.55 In what follows I will present a revised interpretation that refl ects the actual Valentinian teaching about gradations of spiritual seed that infused all humanity and led to three types of people.Previous scholarship is divided on the subject of Valentinian marriage practices, with some scholars advocating that the Valentinians were engaged in “spiritual” or “celibate” marriages, while others argue that their marriages allowed for sexual activity.56 Elaine Pagels is even of the opinion that the Valentinians did not have a consistent practice at all: “Some of them ate meat offered to idols; some attended pagan festivals and were sexually active (which Irenaeus took to mean promis-cuous); others claimed to live as ascetics, either in celibate marriages or in solitude.”57These differing opinions appear to result from the fact that the Valentinian texts were written for “insiders:” people who already understood the mythology and terminology.

In order to rediscover the Valentinian meaning, it is necessary to recon-textualize the phrases within the larger Valentinian myth, while taking into account the more general mentality of the period. The phrases must make sense within the broader second-century worldview as well as within the larger theological framework of Valentinian musings about the human plight. In doing so, historical interpretation must be combined with literary analysis.What do the Church Fathers and the Valentinians say about mar-riage and sexual activity? First, they state very clearly that it is a “great mystery” or sacrament refl ecting the conjunctions within the Pleroma.58 For instance, Irenaeus explains that the Valentinians interpreted Ephe-sians 5:32 (“This mystery is a profound one, and I am saying that it refers to Christ and the Church”) to refer to “the conjunctions within the Pleroma” and apparently associated Christ with the Anthropos aeon and Church with his aeonic spouse Ecclesia. Thus when Paul described the nature of “the conjugal union in this life,”59 the Valentin-ians, according to Irenaeus, believed that he understood these conjugal unions to be a “great mystery” refl ecting the conjunctions within the Pleroma.60 This idea is repeated by Irenaeus later, when he mentions the Valentinian “bridal chamber.” He writes that some Valentinians claim to participate in “spiritual” marriages after “the likeness of the conjunctions above.”61Clement uses this idea to contrast the Valentinians with several encratic groups that he vehemently opposes because they have a “hatred for the fl esh,” which leads them to reject “the marriage union.”62 He applauds the Valentinians because they “take delight in marriage” for the reason that marriage is the syzygy brought down from the “divine emanations above.”63 Does this marriage include sexual activity?

And not celibate marriage either, since Clement portrays this encratic option negatively throughout his tract. This leaves us with a third option, which Clement tries to promote and contrast with the encratic position and which appears to depend on Stoic teachings:67 marital sex for the purpose of procreation, controlled by the will rather than by lust. He tells us that Christians shoulddo nothing from lust (epithumia). Our will is to be directed only towards that which is necessary. For we are children not of lust but of will (thelematos). A man who marries for the sake of begetting children must practice self-control so that it is not lust he feels for his wife, whom he ought to love, and that he may beget children with a chaste and controlled will.6864 Strom. 3.29.65 Stählin, Clemens Alexandrinus, 209.66 Strom. 3.29, in Stählin, Clemens Alexandrinus, 209.67 For Clement’s dependence on Stoic teachings for his view on marriage, see Pohlenz, “Klemens van Alexandreia und sein hellenisches Christentum,” 144; Span-neut, Le stoïcisme, 259–260; Noonan, Contraception, 46–49, 76–77; Broudéhoux, Mariage et famille chez Clément d’Alexandrie, 115–137.

Given their mythology of aeonic relationships which they believed to be procreative, it would certainly be accurate to state that they saw human marriage in procreative terms as well. Moreover, they describe aeonic procreation in terms of contemplative and intellectual acts, that is to say, the object of their thoughts during the procreative moment determines the nature of the beings that they generate. For instance, Sophia’s focus on her desire and passion to “know” the Father resulted in an amorphous nasty miscarriage. Sophia’s focus on the beauty of Jesus’ attendant angels resulted in the production of spirit beings that were refl ections of the angels. And so forth.The connection between contemplation and procreation is very ancient: it stems back as far as the time of ancient Israel and even infl uenced husbandry practices. According to Genesis 30:37–39, Jacob placed peeled branches near his herd’s water trough so that, when they bred in front of them, the fl ock would bear striped, spotted, and speckled offspring. Reproductive theories from at least as early as the fi fth century B.C.E. in Greece refl ect this concept. Empedocles, a Greek scientist and philosopher of the fi fth century B.C.E., is credited with the opinion that the embryo is shaped by the imagination of the mother at the moment of conception.70 This is proven to him by the fact that women who have fallen in love with statues often give birth to children that resemble them.71 Hence it was commonly accepted among the ancients that the characteristics of a child would be largely determined by the thoughts of the parents, particularly the mother, at the time of intercourse. For instance, in Soranus’ Gynecology he remarks,What is one to say concerning the fact that various states of the soul also produce certain changes in the mold of the fetus? For instance, some women, seeing monkeys during intercourse have borne children resembling monkeys. The tyrant of the Cyprians who was misshapen 69 This section is based on my previous publication, “The Great Mystery of Mar-riage,” 331–333.70 This belief seems very ancient and widespread. Cf.

Thus, in order that the offspring may not be rendered misshapen, women must be sober during coitus because in drunkenness the soul becomes the victim of strange fantasies; this furthermore, because the offspring bears some resemblance to the mother as well, not only in body but in soul. Therefore it is good that the offspring be made to resemble the soul when it is stable and not deranged by drunkenness.72He goes on to remark that a woman must remain very calm and sensible throughout her pregnancy. If she does not, she risks not only miscarriage but may even produce a child that is malformed in body and mind because of her anxieties.73In addition to statues, paintings were also suspect, as we see in Helio-dorus’ Ethiopian Story. The birth of a white daughter to black parents is explained in these words:During intercourse with my husband the picture of Andromeda (painted on the bedroom wall) presented her image to my eyes, showing her entirely nude, just as Perseus was taking her down from the rock, and it had thus by ill fortune given to the seed a form similar in appearance to that of the heroine.74In fact, the physician Galen did not allow images to be painted in bed-rooms because “a monster . . . can be caused by a special action of the imaginative power of a woman having sex. It is possible that when such a fi gure springs to mind, the fetus will be disposed in accordance to it.”75Certainly these ideas are based on a combination of two ancient beliefs, one having to do with ancient theories of the vision, the other with ancient theories of conception. A predominant understanding of vision stated that the image beheld was captured by the eye, traveled along the optic nerve, and literally stamped itself on the soul, trans-forming it: “The pleasure which comes from vision enters by the eyes and makes its home in the breast; bearing with it ever the image . . . it impresses it upon the mirror of the soul and leaves there its image.”76 This idea is as old as Plato, who suggested that the vision of the object 72 Soranus, Gynecology 1.39.73 Soranus, Gynecology 1.47.74 Heliodorus, Ethiopian Story 4.8.75 Pseudo-Albert’s citation of Galen in Lemay, Women’s Secrets, 116.76 Achilles Tatius, Clitophon and Leucippe 5.13."},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"  conceiving  spirits  39touched the eye and was transmitted to the soul.77 In fact, he uses the image of the soul as a block of wax upon which a vision received is imprinted like the stamp of a signet ring.78As for theories of conception, these were developed largely to explain family resemblances and to give function to some of the anatomical structures the ancients knew about. One popular theory held that the father implants his seed into the female, much like a farmer sows seed in the ground. The mother’s uterus provides the environment for the seed to grow and be nourished by her menses.79 There were a few authorities who thought that the mother actually provided seed from her own “testicles” and that it contributed to the formation of the child. These authors generally talked about the womb being a battleground for the two seeds, with the outcome of the battle determining whether the child more resembled the father or the mother.80 This meant that the balance of four elements, qualities, and humors in the body of the parents would ultimately contribute to the formation of the fetus. In fact, the child’s sex could be infl uenced by the parents’ diet and even by the temperature and frequency of the baths the parents might take. At any rate, it was believed from both these perspectives that the condi-tion of the mother’s physical and mental state throughout pregnancy would impact the fetus’ development.The Mystery of Valentinian Marriage 81Given this reproductive theory, it should not be surprising that the Val-entinian Christians prescribe a “correct” way for the aeons to procreate: they must work together as a couple, a syzygy, usually envisioned as a masculine and feminine pair (or, as in the case of the Marcosian ver-sion, as an androgynous being). Because the “fruit” of their intercourse refl ects the attitude of their minds, when the aeons focus on the Father during their coupling, they will produce perfect offspring.77 Martin, The Corinthian Body, 22–23.78 Plato, Theaetetus 191a–196c.79 Aristotle, GA 4.1, 763b30.80 Cf. Hippocratic Corpus, Nature of the Child 4.1 [VII: 474]; On Generation 4; Galen, Usu part. 14.6.81 This section is based on my previous publications, “The Great Mystery of Marriage,” 333–338, and “The True Mysteries,” 250–252."},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"40 april d. deconickThis means that there is an “incorrect” way for the aeons to procreate as well. In this scenario, an aeon who acts without its spouse, brings forth offspring through a solitary act of procreation. The offspring will always be less than perfect because it has only one parent. And horrendous problems may occur when the single parent is also procreating out of lust: the offspring will then refl ect that passion, having neither form nor beauty.Since the Valentinians believed that the universe and all it contained was an “image” or refl ection of the Pleromic world above, it is not surprising that they understood their human physical marriages to be “images” of the aeonic intellectual marriages. Therefore, the Valentin-ians appear to have envisioned two types of human marriage, parallel to those of aeonic marriage. Human marriage was procreative, but one form of it produced more perfect offspring than the other. The higher form of marriage included some sort of consciousness-raising during sexual relations to insure that the children would resemble God. Physical intercourse was not driven by lust, but was a matter of the will or intention. The lower form of marriage was less desirable, or rather, it was undesirable. It was a form of human marriage in which sexual relations were carnal, based on the lustful feelings of the couple. It did not involve consciousness-raising and thus the offspring that it produced was thought to be defective in some way. Better for the couple to remain celibate than produce such error!It is not surprising that in the background of Irenaeus’ polemic against the Valentinians we fi nd fragments of this very ideology of marriage and sexual activity. He claims that the Valentinians believe themselves “to be perfect,” “the elect seed,” because they possess “grace” which has “descended from above by means of unspeakable and indescribable intercourse.” Thus the Valentinians maintain that “in every way it is always necessary for them to practice the mystery of intercourse.” But for the non-elect, sexual intercourse is dangerous because it is not performed as a sacral union but as an expression of sexual lust. Irenaeus quotes them as saying:Whosoever being in this world does not so love a woman as to become one with her, is not of the truth, nor shall attain to the truth. But whosoever being of the world has intercourse with a wife, shall not attain to the truth, because his intercourse with his wife resulted from lust (epithumia).8282 Iren., Adv. haer. 1.6.4, in Rousseau and Doutreleau, Irénée de Lyon, 99."},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"  conceiving  spirits  41Those in the world but not of the world are the Valentinians who will attain to the Pleroma. They are expected to be involved in sacral sexual practices as married couples. The psychics or ordinary Christians, however, are of the world. To be redeemed, they must practice “conti-nence and good works.”83 If they are sexually active, even during their marriages, they are involved in impurity and sin because their minds might be focused on fulfi lling their lustful desires. Similarly, Tertullian reports that the pneumatics,for the purpose of honoring the celestial marriages, [are required] to contemplate and celebrate the mystery always by cleaving to a companion, that is to a woman; otherwise (they account any man) degenerate and a bastard to the truth, who spends his life in the world without loving a woman or uniting himself to her.84The psychics are advised to bear the “yoke of discipline,” growing in the works of “holiness and justice.”85 Epiphanius states, tongue in cheek, that the pneumatics can do anything whatsoever without concern or fear, because they will be saved from anything, while the psychics save themselves “by labor and just deeds.”86We should not be surprised that the Gospel of Philip identifi es the “mystery” of marriage with procreation: “Great is the mystery of mar-riage! For [without] it the world would [not exist].”87 Like Irenaeus and Tertullian, The Gospel of Philip knows of two kinds of human marriage, one that he calls the “marriage of purity”88 and another that he calls the “marriage of impurity.”89 The ideal human marriage is based on “pure” thoughts rather than mere “carnal” (sarkikon) activity, “belonging not to desire (epithumia), but to the will.”90 Even in the carnally-based marriage, the marriage of impurity, the private moment of procreation is a “mystery.” If this is so, how much more mysterious then is concep-tion between partners who enjoy marriages of purity where procreation is a matter of will rather than desire: “If there is a hidden quality to the marriage of impurity, how much more is the marriage of purity a true mystery.”9183 Adv. haer. 1.6.4, in Rousseau and Doutreleau, Irénée de Lyon, 98–100.84 Tert.

For if this is unfortunate enough to happen, the child conceived will resemble the lover rather than the spouse: “The children a woman bears resemble the man who loves her.”92 Nor must the couple’s thoughts be focused on the world, for if this happens, the child will resemble the world.93 Instead, The Gospel of Philip advises the couple to direct their love to God, so that the child will resemble the Lord: “Now you who live together with the son of God, love not the world, but love the Lord, in order that those you will bring forth may not resemble the world, but may resemble the Lord.”94“To resemble the Lord” was a redemptive concern based on a Christological premise. The Valentinians were very advanced in their discussions of the binitarian problem, compared to many other second-century Christian theologians. They had carefully pondered the nature of the relation between the human and divine aspects of Christ and had differing opinions or emphasized different aspects of the equation. From the literature we have, it seems that the discussions among them focused on a Jesus of Nazareth who was made up of a combination of things: he had a corporeal body but one that had apparently been transformed by his enkrateia to such a degree that it was not necessary for him to defecate.95 He had a psyche or soul given to him by the Demiurge. He had an elect spiritual seed implanted in his soul by Sophia. And either at his birth or his baptism—the Valentinians dis-agreed about this point—the Holy Spirit, the aeon from the Pleroma, had entered him.96 When the Valentinians write that they want to birth children who “resemble the Lord,” what they seem to mean is that, if possible, they want to bear children whose souls, like that of Jesus, contain superior spiritual seeds.This important passage in Philip continues: when the husband and wife had focused their minds on God rather than on the passion of the moment, it was believed that they would draw a spirit or thought 92 78:14.93 78:20–25.94 78:20–25, in Layton, Nag Hammadi Codex, 198.95 Clem.

If you become light, it is the light which will share with you. If you become one of those who belong above, it is those who belong above who will rest upon you.97Thus The Gospel of Philip states, regarding this mysterious moment of conception, that “[ i ]t belongs not to the darkness or the night but to the day and the light.”98 During intercourse, the mingling of the parent’s spirits or angels together with the spirit or angel from above somehow resulted in the actual conception of the child’s spirit-seeded soul. This is alluded to in The Exegesis on the Soul too. When the soul adorns itself in beauty, she “enjoys” (mate) her beloved bridegroom, the son sent by the Father. As she is loved by him (me) at the moment of intercourse when he ejaculates his seed into her, she receives from him “the life-giving spirit,” so that by him she bears “good children.” This is called “the great, perfect marvel of birth.”99The language of this last-mentioned passage suggests to me that the Valentinians may not have been opposed to eros. The Coptic term me can render the Greek eros. So the Valentinian lovers appear to have made a distinction between eros and epithumia, between sexual pleasure and lust, between lovemaking and hedonism. They were certainly opposed to carnality, but perhaps not to sexual pleasure between mar-ried partners. In the Valentinian texts we do not encounter anything reminiscent of Augustine’s reproach of eros, the idea that sex should ideally be no more than a handshake. For the Valentinians, sex seems to have been understood as a delightful and sacred experience at the same time, when the souls of the parents mingled with the heavenly powers, resulting in the conception of a spiritually superior child, one that would be morally-inclined and redeemable, if not elect.97 78:29–79:5, in Layton, Nag Hammadi Codex, 198–200.98 82:9–10.99 133.31–134.5."},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"44 april d. deconickThe Embodiment of Souls and Redemption100These ideas about conception may seem far-fetched to us today, but they actually refl ect knowledge of ancient theological, philosophical and medical discussions. There were at least three prevailing theories about the origin of a person’s psyche or soul.101 The most common theory among Greek theologians was creationism: each individual soul was created independently by God at the moment of its infusion into the body.102 Another theory was traducianism: each soul was believed to be generated from the souls of the parents, somehow transmitted through the semen which functioned as the “channel” (traducem).103 The third theory was pre-existence: all souls had been created by God and existed prior to their assignment to individual bodies.104The Valentinians held to this last view: the psychic and the pneumatic stuff were pre-existent and, in fact, pre-cosmic. After the Demiurge had fashioned the physical and psychic bodies, Sophia (or the Logos) implanted pneumatic seeds into them, apparently with the help of an angel or holy spirit. It appears that, again, we are dealing with ancient theories about the origin of the soul. Clement of Alexandria speaks of angels who assist at procreation:An old man said that that which is in the belly is living. For the soul enters the womb, which has been prepared for conception by purifi cation [menstruation] and is introduced [into the womb] by one of those angels provided to oversee birth, who know in advance the time of conception to push the woman toward intercourse, and when the seed has been deposited, as it were, the pneuma which is in the seed is adapted and this takes part in the formation [of the embryo] . . . And if the angels bring good news to barren women, so also do they infuse souls at conception. In the gospel, ‘the babe leapt’ [means that it is] ensouled . . . And because of this barren women are barren, since the soul is not infused, accompanying the depositing of seed for the retention of conception and birth.105100 This section contains material from “The Great Mystery of Marriage,” 338–341.101 Kelly, Early Christian Doctrines, 344–346.102 Cf.

After the semen has been ejaculated into the womb, the angels then deposit the soul at the moment of conception. In fact, barrenness is due to the absence of angelic intervention, not to some problem with either parent!Why were the Valentinians so concerned about conceiving souls implanted with a superior spirit like the Lord’s, one that might be “elect” or, at least, inclined to live morally? Because this would increase the number of souls that had the opportunity to convert to Christian-ity and be redeemed. The Excerpts of Theodotus tells us that procreation must continue in order to ensure that the pneumatic seed will be incar-nated in souls that might become Christian converts. The Valentinians supported this doctrine with their exegesis of Jesus’ saying to Salome that death will reign as long as women bear children. They said that Jesus did not “reproach” birth because birthing “is necessary for the salvation of the believers:” it must continue until all of the “seed” has incarnated. The “birth” Jesus referred to was the generation of the formless substance as the result of Sophia’s suffering in the Pleroma. Before Jesus’ descent from the Pleroma, humans were called “children of the female only.” These children were born out of “base intercourse” and were “incomplete,” “infants,” “senseless,” “weak,” “without form,” and “brought forth like abortions.” But because Jesus came to earth “to separate us from suffering” and grant humans “form” just as he had done with Sophia, the Valentinians stated “we have become children of a husband and a bridal chamber.”106 A little later in Excerpts of Theodotus, Clement speaks of the advent of Jesus in similar terms, highlighting the transformation of the female seeds. As long as the “seed is immature, it is the child of the female.” But after Jesus came, “it was formed, it was changed to a man and becomes a son of the bridegroom.”107 The “woman” is said to be changed into a man, and the Church here on earth into “angels.”108At the Eschaton, when the Pleroma would open up as the fantastic Bridal Chamber, a great communal wedding was imagined, including a banquet, at which all the saved souls would be transformed into 106 Exc.

The Elect or male spirits, and the Called or saved female spirits, would be equalized so that all the pneumatic seeds, as “brides” and matured “intelligent spirits,” would enter the Bridal Chamber on the arms of their grooms, Jesus’ attendant angels109 or the Logos himself.110 Their souls would be worn as glorious “wedding garments.”111 These garments would then be stripped off and left at the door of the Pleromic bedroom, so that the brides and grooms could enter the nuptial chamber naked and join in the full ecstasy of aeonic embrace and marriage, an idea which Tertullian attributes to Valentinus himself.112 Their entrance is described by Tertullian as “the angels of the males” together with the female seeds who will be received by Jesus and become a unity in the Pleroma.113Thus the Eschaton and entrance into the Pleromic Bridal Cham-ber would correct what Adam had perpetuated in the beginning: the dispersion of the spirit in immature form within the corrupted soul. Since Adam had procreated from his material aspect, he had been act-ing from carnality, from lust. Therefore the child he bore, Cain, had a soul inclined toward evil, one whose spiritual seed was easily overcome by the presence of powerful demons and passions. The conception of Abel, on the other hand, was believed to have taken place in such a way that he acquired a soul with a pneumatic seed, but one that was able to respond positively, to live righteously and be redeemed. Seth’s soul, fi nally, was endowed with an elect spiritual seed because his con-ception was marked by Adam’s spiritual aspect, that is the raising of Adam’s soul to the heights of heaven as he lovingly embraced Eve. It was this form of lovemaking that the Valentinians considered sacred and believed would lead to their own redemption, which was nothing less than the redemption of God himself.BibliographyAttridge, H., Nag Hammadi Codex I (The Jung Codex), NHS 22.

The Koran as well as other fundamental religious texts emphasize the difference between what is “apparent” and “outward” (zâhir) and what is “hidden” and “inward” (bâtin). Zâhir is everything that is obvious in our perceptions and thoughts (an empirical phenomenon, the mean-ing of a text), about the presence of which no doubt can be raised. Bâtin is what is not expressed outwardly (feelings for instance), what is hidden in natural phenomena, or concealed in speech. The “hid-den” is, however, no less real than the “apparent.” On the contrary, if anything, the opposite is true.1 The very etymology of these two terms is signifi cant in this respect. Zâhir refers to zahr, the back, while bâtin refers to batn, the belly. The image is clear: what is apparent in human life is actually the backside of reality, the less interesting part of it. The ‘belly’ of reality, the organism that gives life to it, is hidden from perception and common sense. This opposition between apparent and hidden can be applied to the entire universe. It refl ects the structure of God’s manifestation in his creation: “He is the First and the Last, the Outward (al-Zâhir) and the Inward (al-Bâtin).”2The existence of a hidden dimension of reality is also refl ected in Islamic culture generally, in which human knowledge is basically divided between exoteric and esoteric sciences. Only the exoteric ones—grammar, religious sciences, or medicine and astronomy—are offi cially taught: the orthodox doctors do not approve of the quest for esoteric sciences such as alchemy, astrology or magic. They often harshly con-demn them as leading to heresy and the transgression of God’s orders; 1 The opposition zâhir / bâtin was masterly explained in the main works of Henry Corbin, especially Spiritual Body and Celestial Earth, En Islam Iranien and A History of Islamic Philosophy.

In other words, traditional Islamic societies are living in a world of two dimensions:4 while mainly living in the sensible world, they know about a series of boundaries—and openings—between that world and the dimension of the invisible one.The World of DemonsOne of the most central tenets of esoteric knowledge in Islam is the link between human society and the world of the “demons.” “Demons” existed in Arabia before the rise of Islam. They were universally present in the common culture and daily life and highly relevant to the domains of illness and health, divination, and many psychic and intellectual phenomena, such as poetry or music. The belief in their existence continued in Islamic culture, but their function was modifi ed and incorporated in the fabric of common Islamic beliefs and ethics. The function of demons in the Koran and the Sunni tradition is a rather paradoxical one. On the one hand, they are often mentioned. Sura LXXII of the Koran is even dedicated to them: Say (o Muhammad): “It has been revealed to me that a company of the demons ( jinn) gave ear, and they said ‘We have indeed heard a Koran that is wonderful, guiding to rectitude. We believe in it, and we will not associate with our Lord anyone.’ ”5These “demons” are most commonly referred to as jinn (sg jinnî, fem. jinniyya). The term stems from the Arabic root JNN and does not seem to be derived from the Latin genius, as has been suggested by some scholars. The root JNN suggests the idea of being covered, dark, unseen. 3 See Corbin, Spiritual Body and Celestial Earth, about the notion of “world of Hûrqâlyâ,” the “place” of the transformation of spirits into bodies and bodies into spirits, the realm of history beyond history. About alchemy specifi cally, see Part II, IX, 4.4 Quite similar to the one described in Jeff Kripal’s interesting chapter “Sex with the Angels,” in Kripal, Esalen.5 Koran LXXII 1–2. The text goes on: “. . . The fools among us spoke against God outrage, and we had thought that men and jinn would never speak a lie against God. But there were certain men of mankind who would take refuge with certain men of the jinn, and they increased them in vileness, and they thought, even as you also thought, that God would never raise up anyone, etc.” See also Suyûtî, Laqt al-marjân, 44–62."},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":" sexual intercourse between humans and demons 51For example, janîn means the foetus, janân means the heart, and the expression janna al-layl means “the night was falling.” For most Mos-lems there can be no doubt about the existence of the jinns. They are described as earthly beings, generally living under the ground. They eat, drink, and reproduce, but in a way that is different from human beings: for example, they eat dirt and live in wild, abandoned regions.It is important to realize that jinn are not necessarily evil. The so-called “satans” (shaytân pl. shayâtîn) of the Koran are generally consid-ered rebellious, evil-doing jinn, such as the followers of Iblîs / Satan who refused to obey God’s commandments.6 Sura LXXII mentioned above explains that some jinn are believers and faithful, whereas others are sinners.7 Tradition explains that the beliefs of jinn mirror those of humans: some jinn are Muslims (sunna, shixa, etc.), others are Christians, Jews, or pagans. Like humans, they are concerned with obedience and transgression.8 It is important to note that extensive confusion remains between the devils (shayâtîn) and the jinn in general in religious litera-ture as well as in popular Islam. According to one tradition, Iblîs / Satan is indeed the father of the jinn, just like Adam was the father of mankind.9The Koran suggests that prophets were sent to the jinn as well as to humans: “Company of jinn and mankind, did not Messengers come to you from among you, relating to you My signs and warning you of the encounter of this your day?”10 They closely resemble the human population, the main difference being their “fi ery” shape,11 which enables them to move very quickly, to fl y, to become invisible to humans, and 6 Koran II 34–36, XVII 61–64; Shiblî, Âkâm al-marjân, 149–166; Suyûtî, Laqt al-marjân, 17–18, 83–88; Fahd, “Anges, démons et djinns” 189–190. The theologians mentioned by Shiblî and Suyûtî mention the important question of the difference between the Satanic inner voice tempting humans, and the voice of divine inspiration. 7 “And some of us are the righteous, and some of us are otherwise; we are sects differing. . . .

They are linked to several types of animals, and often appear in the form of snakes, scorpions, rats, mice, ravens, pigeons, donkeys, or dogs.12 Jinn have the ability to understand many things that are beyond human reach: hence the temptation for human beings of making them allies by means of magical practices. All this can be deduced from many Koranic passages and oral teachings of the prophet Muhammad, the hadîth.13 The idea put forward by some ratio-nalistic thinkers that jinn could sometimes be a mere metaphor for hid-den phenomena was rejected by the consensus of Sunni scholars.14While they are widely believed in by Muslims, jinn play no impor-tant role in their religious life. Before the arrival of Islam, Arabs had established some connection between jinn and angels, but the Koranic exegesis refused any confusion between them, and a fortiori any direct link between jinn and God. This last point refers to the fact that pre-Islamic gods and goddesses were considered to be children of the marriage between God and female angels or jinniyya-s.15 Islamic Law tells believers to pay no attention to the jinn. Although king Salomo subjugated them so as to have their assistance in the construction of huge buildings, according to the Koran,16 Muslim doctors insist that for ordinary believers contact with jinn is useless and could become danger-ous. These potential dangers concern the believers’ material life, but also their spiritual evolution: jinn might tempt them into committing some kind of idolatry, the most terrible sin in Islamic belief. Jinn are in no 12 Suyûtî, Laqt al-marjân, 21 quotes an interesting hadîth (word of the Prophet, see following note): “God created jinn of three kinds. Some are like snakes, scorpions, earthly insects; others are like wind in the air; others are responsible for their acts and may be punished.” Thus are enumerated the main manifestations of jinn for humans: they appear in the natural world of animals, in humanly incomprehensible illnesses, and as another sometimes evil counterpart of themselves.13 The hadîth are oral teachings attributed to the prophet Muhammad, written two or three centuries after his death and gathered into large collections. Although considered less authoritative than the Koran itself, they play a role of paramount importance in the domains of Islamic dogma, Law, and ethics.14 Among those intellectuals, one can think of several theologians belonging to the rather rationalistic theological school of the Mu{tazila. The Mu{tazila stated that no opposition was possible between the content of the Koran and reason; they were rather suspicious towards miracles etc. Several philosophers or free-thinkers like the physician Muhammad ibn Zakariyyâ Râzî (known as Rhazes in the Latin Middle Ages) were likewise skeptical about the very existence of jinn.15 Chelhod, Les structures du sacré, 78–81.16 Koran XXI 82, XXVII 39, XXXVIII 37, where no precise distinction seems to be made between jinn and devils; cf.

As a consequence, jinn remain locked in the unspoken, dark level of Muslim consciousness and culture; and it is precisely here that lies their interest for the present volume. The offi cial, scholarly religious discourse does not pay much attention to jinn, but actually they play a role of considerable importance in the daily life of ordinary believers. In some Islamic societies, as we shall see, nearly all the actions of daily life are infl uenced by the idea of the possible presence or intervention of jinn.Sexual Relations with DemonsJinn reproduce themselves sexually, as mentioned before, but they may also have intercourse with human beings. The Koran mentions the vir-gins of Paradise, the hûrîs promised to the believers, as “maidens . . . un-touched before them by any man or jinn.”18 In this respect, our main source in Islamic tradition is The Hills of Coral Concerning the Status of the Jinn: a synthesis on the subject composed, with the traditional material available in Sunnite Islam, by Badr al-dîn al-Shiblî († 1367).19 Shiblî explains in his introduction that he decided to compose his treatise after a discussion he had had about the marriages between humans and jinn; thus the issue seems to have been an important one. According to most scholars quoted by Shiblî, the jinn may remain invisible, but may also appear to human beings in a physical shape. How do they appear? Here the Islamic tradition gave free rein to the imagination. 17 The myth of “fallen angels” is nevertheless not absent from the Koran. Verse II 102 alludes to “Babylon’s two angels Harut and Marut” who taught magical practices to humans. Several Islamic traditions assert that Harut and Marut were tempted by the beauty of human women, and therefore dwelled on earth disclosing heavenly secrets.18 Koran LV 56, 74. The exegetes agree that the verb translated as “touching” means precisely “defl owering.” The question of how bodily intercourse is possible between the subtle, fi ery jinn and human beings was discussed by Islamic scholars, similarly to debates on the same subject during the Latin Middle Ages (see Allison Coudert’s contribution in this volume); most scholars claimed that jinn could make their bodies as dense as those of humans for the purpose of having sex.19 Âkâm al-marjân fî ahkâm al-jânn; the book was used by the great scholar Jalâl al-dîn al-Suyûtî (d. 1505) in his own treatise dedicated to the jinn, Laqt al-marjân fî ahkâm al-jânn (The Gathering of Coral Concerning the Status of the Jinn), which is also valuable because of the precision of his references. The reference to coral probably has to do with the Koranic verse LV 22–23: “From the two seas come forth the pearl and the coral. Which of your Lord’s bounties will you (human) and you ( jinn) deny?”"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"54 pierre loryMany stories describe jinn as similar to human beings, but with verti-cal pupils like cat’s eyes and with legs resembling those of a goat or a camel.20 The females appear either as ugly old women with hanging breasts, or as beautiful, fascinating young ladies. Many people think that jinn may adopt whatever appearance they choose. This explains why the frightening jinniyya called ghûla tries to attack men who are alone in the desert in order to steal their spirits, drive them mad and/or have intercourse with him. The poet Taxabbata sharran21 described his own struggle in the desert with a terrifying ghûla: “She had two eyes like those of a cat, in an ugly face, and a split tongue, two thin legs, the skull of a dog, and her skin seemed to be a worn-out mantel or goatskin.”22 A fellow poet, {Amr ibn Yarbû{, seems to have had more luck: he married a jinniyya who gave to him several children.Traditions of the Prophet or his elder Companions give some further details about sexual intercourse with jinn, and Islamic Law devotes several sections to this controversial point. The following topics are raised:(1) Intercourse between a woman and a jinnî along with her husband. A famous hadîth says: “He who has intercourse with his wife without saying ‘in the name of Allâh’, will have Satan enter his penis and participate in the intercourse.”23 Another well-known hadîth states: “He who has intercourse with his wife while she is menstruating will have Satan precede him, and she will get pregnant with an effeminate.”24 In the Koran itself, God authorizes Satan to tempt mankind by instructing him to “. . . share with them in their wealth and their children.”2520 Chelhod, Les structures du sacré, 72–74. These pre-Islamic representations were taken over by Islamic culture, and are to be found (with many variations) in all Islamic countries.21 This poet lived in the sixth century, shortly before the rise of Islam; therefore, his poem is devoid of religious references. “Taxabbata sharran” is actually a nickname mean-ing “he took an evil under his arm” and alludes to his famous fi ght with the ghûla.22 Poem A-lâ man mublighun fi tyâna fahmin, quoted by Ibn Qutayba, Al-shi{r wa-al-shu{arâ, 175.23 Shiblî, Âkâm al-marjân, 65, 172–173; Suyûtî, Laqt al-marjân, 31. It is a religious recommendation for Moslems to pronounce the formula “In the name of God” before accomplishing important actions in daily life, like eating or having sex.24 Shiblî, Âkâm al-marjân, 75–76, 173; Suyûtî, Laqt al-marjân, 30–31. It is true that the hadîth here mentions Satan and not a jinnî; but, as noticed before, there is much confusion between the two notions. Intercourse is forbidden to Moslems while the wife has her period.25 Koran XVII 64. The meaning of the verse–does it refer to the children of mankind, or of Iblîs himself—is not clear however."},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":" sexual intercourse between humans and demons 55(2) The possibility of children being born from intercourse between human beings and jinn. Several scholars assert that it is not possible, and that such unions remain sterile. But, as law specialists point out, this does not eliminate the possibility of marriages between men and jinn:26 one may legally marry barren or old women without expecting children to be born. On the other hand, Islamic lore tells us much about the children that are in fact born from marriages between human beings and jinn. Bilqîs, the queen of Saba who married king Salomo, was supposedly the daughter of a Yemeni king and a princess of jinn.27 According to the Nawâdir al-usûl, a famous collection of hadîth composed by the scholar and mystic al-Hakîm al-Tirmidhî († 930), the Prophet had said: “Among you are those who are expatriated (mugharrabûn);” and this, he explained, meant “crossed with jinn.”28 The linguist Tha{âlibî (d. 1038) mentions that the child born from a marriage between a man and a jinniyya is called a khanas, or a {amlûq, depending on the species of the demon.(3) The lawfulness of marriage. Tradition mentions the case of Muslim jinn requesting to marry Muslim women according to the sharî{a. Most of the juridical authorities of the fi rst century questioned on this point—such as Qatâda, Hasan al-Basrî, al-Hakam—agree that such a marriage is not desirable (makrûh).29 This means that it is not utterly forbidden (harâm), and we do in fact fi nd several references to such unions; but it does mean that a believer should avoid marrying a jinn if he can. When questioned by Yemeni Muslims about this very subject, Mâlik ibn Anas († 796), the founder of the mâlikî juridical school, answered: “I do not see an impediment for this in religion, but I fi nd it undesir-able that the wife, if she becomes pregnant and is asked “who is your husband?”, answers “he is a jinnî,” because this could bring corruption in Islam.”30 Several later fatwas confi rmed this judgement,31 arguing that God created everything according to an order of harmony, which des-tined man and woman for each other and jinnî for jinniyya. It should be noticed here that the question is not concerned with the nature ( physis, ar. tabî{a) of man, but only with his status ( juridical position, ar. hukm). 26 Shiblî, Âkâm al-marjân, 66.27 Shiblî, Âkâm al-marjân, 69; Suyûtî, Laqt al-marjân, 31–32.28 Quoted by Suyûtî, Laqt al-marjân, 32.29 Shiblî, Âkâm al-marjân, 67–69; Suyûtî, Laqt al-marjân, 33–38. Zuhrî, relying on a hadîth, seems to have considered such a marriage as utterly forbidden.30 Fiqh al-lugha, quoted by Shiblî, Âkâm al-marjân, 69.31 Shiblî, Âkâm al-marjân, 65–66; Suyûtî, Laqt al-marjân, 33."},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"56 pierre loryWhether one is a human being or a demon is not wholly decided by birth: the will of God and the intention of man can actually turn an individual into something like a jinnî, or, as we will see, an angel. In any case, the fact that mankind is in a process of decline causes the divinely ordained harmony to be broken, according to a hadîth about the Latter Days: “The Hour will come when the children of jinn will become many among you.”32Other arguments are adduced from the Koran. The Sacred Texts recommend marriage, but their many references to “wives” (azwâj ) can only refer to human females. Shiblî calls particular attention to verses VII 189: “It is (God) who created you out of one living soul, and made of him his spouse that he might rest in her.” And XXX 21: “and one of His signs is that He created for you, of yourselves, spouses so you might repose in them, and He has set between you love and mercy.” Wives are given to men so that they may rest in them. But, says Shiblî, a man cannot rest in a jinniyya. When it happens that a man or a woman marries a demon, it is because the human partner in the relationship is frightened and threatened by the jinn, and this does not agree with the Koranic principles.33 This fact—the jinnî or jinniyya appearing as a terrifying threat—underlines that the representation of erotic links with jinn is basically linked to fear and not to eros as pleasure.Several traditional stories hint at another dimension of the question: the jinn may represent an unexpected, terrifying danger. Several accounts speak of the danger for a woman—especially when she is weakened by agony or illness—to be raped by a jinni. But the narratives are not always just an expression of fear about violence done by demons. According to traditions quoted by Shiblî and Suyûtî, some women assert that inter-course with a jinnî causes the same sensation of orgasm as intercourse with their husbands. It is not clear for Muslim lawyers whether actual intercourse is evoked or simply a kind of hallucination.34 Another motive is that of men being kidnapped by jinn. Quite reminiscent of contemporary UFO abduction stories, such legends brought up the legal 32 Quoted by Suyûtî, Laqt al-marjân, 38, who in addition interprets this hadîth in terms of the increase of adultery at the end of history. This interpretation is important: it suggests not only the idea of an metaphorical exegesis of the hadîth, but also the idea that men may become similar to jinn as a result of their own behavior.33 Shiblî, Âkâm al-marjân, 66–67.34 Shiblî, Âkâm al-marjân, 73–76; Suyûtî, Laqt al-marjân, 31, 127–129."},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":" sexual intercourse between humans and demons 57question of what to do when a husband had been kidnapped for a long time and his wife asked for a new marriage.35 In any case, these stories clearly indicate that jinnî were believed to be capable of interfering in daily life, albeit in a very special dimension of human consciousness, in an “inter-world” between dream and waking consciousness.36 This in-between dimension—which is referred to for explaining not only relations with jinn but also with the souls of the dead or with angels—is of crucial importance for understanding Muslim approaches towards the domain of the “paranormal.”For many centuries, the concept that intercourse is possible between humans and demons has exerted a tremendous infl uence over the popu-lar imagination. To give only one example of the mediaeval mentality, we may look at the travel account of the Iranian scholar Ibn al-Mujâwir in Yemen in thirteenth-century Arabia:The inhabitants of Turan are descended from a woman called al-Fâliqa who came out of the sea. She settled on land and married a prominent Arab who took her to live on the land of Turan. Children were born to her, both male and female. The Arabs declared: ‘The inhabitants of Turan are from the offspring of the Arab and the woman’, meaning Fâliqa. [Next follows an account of the miracles accomplished by Fâliqa.] I asked {Amr ibn {Alî ibn Muqbil: “What on earth happened to Fâliqa?” He replied that she was still alive. “Where does she live?”, I asked. “In Wâdî Qutayna,” he replied. I asked where the wadi was. He said: “In the region of Turan. And she will not die until the Day of Resurrection.” I asked if anyone ever saw her. He replied: “Yes, everyone approaching the end of his life-span.”37Sexual Intercourse as Possession in Contemporary Islam: The Case of {Aïsha QandîshaNowadays, in Islamic countries (especially in rural areas, but in the cities as well) one can still observe how omnipresent the jinn are in social, 35 Suyûtî, Laqt al-marjân, 93–97.36 Most Muslims consider such stories to be real (that is to say, to be more than dreams), even though they do not pertain to normal everyday reality. They must be understood in terms of an “in-between world” (barzakh), somewhat comparable to the occidental concept of an “astral plane,” but considered quite as real as the material world. One should not expect complete logical consistency: for example, if a man has been kidnapped he has become invisible, so the question is what has happened with his material body. Clear answers to such questions are not given. 37 Smith, “Magic, Jinn and the Supernatural,” 9."},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"58 pierre loryand hence also in sexual life. Furthermore, very similar concepts of jinn can also be encountered in other contexts, such as that of the Copts in Egypt.38 Jinn are more generally believed to be active in causing illnesses, strange events, or simply (bad) luck. Love is one of the most frequent causes of relationships beings established between humans and jinn. In her study of exorcism in the Yemeni province of Hadramawt, Sylvaine Camelin states:Love seems to be the most frequent occasion of contact between men and jinn. A jinnî meets a woman and falls in love with her, or the reverse: a jinniyya meets a man and falls in love with him. In such a case, the jinnî wants to possess the human person. He enters his or her body. This pos-session is manifest notably when the jinnî has sexual intercourse with the person he/she possesses. In that case, the man (or the woman) behaves with gestures and words as if he (or she) were having sexual intercourse, although he (or she) is apparently alone in the room. Besides, this person seems to suddenly lose all interest for his/her environment—and especially for his wife (her husband) and withdraw into himself (herself ).39These concepts of human/demonic couples are reminiscent of several rituals of a shamanistic type, such as the East-African, Nilotic and Yemeni zâr ceremonies, where the (female) offi ciants often act as if they were the wives or mothers of the spirits they invoke.40What we would consider as cases of “spirit possession” is often seen by the people concerned as actual sexual intercourse between jinn and human, the jinnî being an independent embodied entity. For example, in northern Morocco, several important saints, such as Sîdî {Ali ben Hamdûsh or Sîdî Ahmad Dghûghî, are venerated and sought out as healers. They are particularly important to people affi liated with mar-ginal and shamanic brotherhoods like the Aïssawa or the Afro-Islamic 38 Viaud, Magie et coutumes, 26–27.39 “Croyance aux djinns,” 173; see also Shiblî, Âkâm al-marjân, 104–112; and Suyûtî, Laqt al-marjân, 98–117.40 Battain, “Osservazioni sul rito zar”, 119. The thirteenth century author Ibn al-Mujâwir describes the quest for magical power as follows: “When a woman wants to learn perfect sorcery, she takes a human and roasts him until he dissolves and is reduced to grease.

The interesting point for us is that they are “coupled” with a female demon (as their wife, or sometimes daughter). These female demons actually share in the holiness of the saint with whom they are associated and in his spreading of baraka; and they often give the impression of possessing a power that is equal or even superior to that of the saint. The most famous of these jinniyya-s is called {Aïsha Qandîsha, or better Lalla (Lady) {Aïsha. She is described as being very powerful, fi erce, and unsmiling. She may harm people and become very dangerous.42 The importance of this fi gure is that she elicits a double attitude of fascination with and fear of feminine power: Lalla {Aïsha seems to be a hard, severe mother, and yet at the same time she is the most attractive female fi gure one can imagine. One of her main activities is that of seducing men, whether bachelors or married. Actually, she manifests herself as a plurality of female demons who are venerated in various locations, not unlike the Roman Catholic veneration of Our Lady in a variety of cultic locations (Lourdes, Fatima, Guadalupe) with their specifi c attendant rituals. In the case of Lalla {Aïsha, the most well-known are:• {Aïsha Hamdûshiyya, wife of Sîdî {Alî ben Hamdûsh; she is black and lives near a river.• {Aïsha Sûdâniyya, a black jinniyya, wife of Sîdî Ahmad Dghûghî. Her domain is the desert and dry areas.• {Aïsha Bahriyya is white, living near the coast, near Salé. She is said to be the wife of Sidi Mûsâ al-Dukkalî, a thirteenth-century saint, venerated as a spirit of the ocean.• {Aïsha Gnawiyya is also a water-spirit. She is black.• {Aïsha mûlet al-wed is another (white) water-jinniyya, living near the rivers.43Lalla {Aïsha is particularly dangerous because of the manner in which she seduces men. In an isolated place, a man may encounter her in 41 These brotherhoods have always had close relations with each other.

But once they have had intercourse, the man fi nds himself the prisoner of his own promise, of the contract made with her. If he refuses to fulfi l it, he gets ill and may die.44 If he accepts to marry Lalla {Aïsha, he must usually forsake all relations with other women (except his legal wife), wear old and dirty clothes, eat little or feed himself with no matter what, desert his friends, and in fact lead the life of a lunatic. Furthermore, he is required to regularly attend ceremonies celebrating {Aïsha.45 The Moroccan psychologist Ali Aouat-tah relates several stories of this type. A certain Ben Aïssa, who was clinically treated for possession in a Moroccan hospital, had fallen in love with his cousin, but once having married her, he discovered to his dismay that she was no longer a virgin. Several days later he encountered a woman with red eyes and legs like those of a camel, who explained to him that she had taken the shape of her cousin in order to possess him, and that he now belonged to her. When he refused, she started to beat him fi ercely. Henceforth she appeared to him regularly, beat-ing him each time he refused, even after he had entered the army in an attempt to escape from her (since jinn supposedly do not like iron, he tried to protect himself by seeking out an environment with great amounts of this metal).46Another and more complicated case is that of a couple which had lost a young child due to an accident and were living in an atmosphere of guilt, fear and anger. The husband got possessed by {Aïsha Qandî-sha, and his wife by a male jinnî, the husband of {Aïsha Qandîsha. Their sexual relations became scarce, and the double possession in fact resulted in a kind of therapeutic “ménage à quatre” (unthinkable though it may be in a Muslim climate), but somehow they managed to fi nd a new balance by means of their double relationship with the jinn. A relationship of this kind is often offi cially established and organized in the frame of rituals during which jinn are supposed to be present and give their agreement to the situation. The therapeutic importance of such rituals—especially those involving {Aïsha Qandisha—has been strongly emphasized by several anthropologists.4744 Cases of such possessions are given by Crapanzano, Hamadcha, 228–232, who also provides information about other ‘Aïsha’s well-known in northern Morocco.45 Crapanzano, Hamadcha, 252–262.46 Ethnopsychiatrie maghrébine, 52.47 Ibid., 63–65, where Aouattah gives other clinical examples.

They ask her for healing, children, money, or want her to attack a rival. Among the sacrifi ces given to her, milk (possibly as a symbol of semen) is common, but animals are also very important, because Lalla {Aïsha gets her strength from “drinking” their blood. Devotees often cut the skin of their heads to let it bleed for the same purpose.48Services addressed to the male saints take place in shrines during the day and are offi ciated by men. In contrast, the female ceremonies devoted to the many {Aïshas take place in natural surroundings (in a cave, near a well or a tree) during the night, and the leader of the ceremony is a woman. The offerings made to {Aïsha consist of blood—menstrual blood in particular—and excrements. The rituals may be private and restricted to a small circle, or they may be organized by several brotherhoods at the same time, like the Hamadsha, the Jilâla, and the Gnawa. The part of the ritual specifi cally dedicated to Lalla {Aïsha (for part of it is taken up by prayers addressed to God or the Prophet) takes place in the middle of the night, when she may become visible to her devotees. There does not seem to be any evidence in this context for sexual rituals involving intercourse between men and women, as one might perhaps expect: we are not dealing here with some kind of “Islamic Tantra,” nor with practices resembling the “sex magic” described by Hans Thomas Hakl elsewhere in this volume. The alleged rituals of the Nusayrî,49 which have sparked the imagination of some Westerners, seem to be a legend forged by the Sunnis.DiscussionFrom practices and beliefs such as those discussed above, many scholars have concluded that a clear distinction must be drawn between the “mystical” rituals of the Sufi s, addressed to God and seeking union with Him, and “shamanic” practices, such as those that are based on contact with jinn. This interpretation is probably misleading. Although there is, of course, a theological difference between God, angels, saints, and jinn, these categories often get confused in popular opinion. For the Hamadsha observed by Crapanzano, for instance, {Aïsha Qandîsha is a 48 Hell, Le tourbillon des génies, 335–336; Crapanzano, Hamadcha, 291–324.49 See Hugh Urban, “The Yoga of Sex,” elsewhere in this volume."},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"62 pierre loryGod-like creature, not just an ordinary jinniyya.50 The key notion here is the question of power (baraka). Baraka is a spiritual energy which is effective in earthly life; it is subtle, all-pervading, and has something to do with holiness. The Islamic notion of holiness is quite different from a European one in that holiness is not necessarily based upon virtue, but upon reliance on God. God is the Almighty, all powers come from Him, and a man or a woman who prays to Him and relies on Him at every moment and for every action of his/her life receives a part of this divine power. This is true not only of ascetics or religious scholars, but also of a shaman, that is a person recognized by his group as a bearer of baraka. Holiness is based on the circulation of baraka through precise means and channels, one of them being the Koran itself: hence the recitation of verses of the Koran protects against the evil jinn and the devils but can also be helpful for other purposes. Such instrumental use of the Holy Text in talismans, magic squares, and so on may help to gain money, power—or love.51 But there are other sources of baraka too, especially those manifested in Morocco by the {Aïshas.In a very patriarchal and “masculine” society like that of the Maghreb, the role of the {Aïshas can be interpreted in terms of the visualisation of female energy, fl owing by means of Sufi sainthood. {Aïsha Hamdûshiyya is the female counterpart of Sîdî {Alî ben Hamdûsh’s baraka, and the same goes for {Aïsha Sûdâniyya and Sîdî Ahmad Dghûghî—{Aïsha Qandîsha being the general designation for this kind of energy. Some scholars think that the unexplained surname ‘Qandîsha’ may derive from the Semitic root Q D SH, from which stems the meaning of the words “sacred” or “sacredness.” The sexual union of a man with Lalla {Aïsha has something to do with retrieving this specifi c kind of energy; and in an Islamic society, this must be understood not only as a kind of therapy, but as a means of spiritual advancement as well. The reason is simply that there is only one baraka, coming from God and leading to Him. Hence worshipping Lalla {Aïsha does not mean practicing anti-Islamic, pagan rites. On the contrary, contact with the saint (or his “wives”) is a means of improving the moral quality of daily life and of getting closer to the Lord of all beings.50 Crapanzano, Hamadcha, 217–218.51 This use may be compared to the magic use of the Song of Songs studied by Claire Fanger, “Eros and Magic in the Middle Age,” in this volume."},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":" sexual intercourse between humans and demons 63Brief mention can be made here, fi nally, to another aspect of the question of relations between humans and jinn, which has some links with esotericism: the notion of the Doppelgänger, the spiritual double. In a well-known hadîth, Muhammad says:You all have along with you your double (qarîn) from the jinn. They asked him: And you also, o messenger of God? He answered: I also, but God helped me against him, and he submitted [or: became Muslim, aslama] and now he only commands me to do good deeds.52The text does not specify whether the jinnî is male or female, but the idea of the couple is clearly present, and the Arabic word qarîn refl ects the idea of companionship and marriage (qarîna = spouse). The demonic partner is not “external” to the individual, but rather lives inside him, as a part of himself and of his psychic life. In the Islamic tradition, the qarîn represents a kind of demonic, egoistic energy leading humans on the path of satisfying their selfi sh wishes and hence of temptation or even rebellion. The goal of religious life is to control this power, to tame it, and to fi nally get in harmony with it; hence the Law of Islam may go deeper than simple social regulations and religious institutions, to try to build up a new harmony in a man’s personality.In conclusion: the world of jinn seems to be the reverse of our world. Hence, according to the pious—or even mystic—Muhâsibî († 857), the jinn will enter Paradise, but humans will be invisible to them: a situation which is exactly the reverse of the one here on earth. An anecdote found in another source epitomizes the above: it is said that the world of jinn is completely parallel to that of humans—but they have no mirrors, and that is why they are frightened to discover their own image in a mirror when they enter the human world.53BibliographyAouattah, Ali, Ethnopsychiatrie maghrébine—Représentations et thérapies traditionnelles de la maladie mentale au Maroc.

Or, so it might seem, as eroticism osten-sibly exposes the concealed and esotericism conceals the exposed. On closer examination, however, this contrast does not engender divergence as much as difference that suggests its own sameness in being different. Alternatively expressed, exposure of the concealed and concealment of the exposed ought not be seen as binary opposites; hermeneuti-cally, exposure is the most exposed concealment, and concealment the most concealed exposure. To attend this paradox is to ascertain that the exposed is precisely what is concealed in being exposed as what is concealed, an inherent duplicity that renders every act of uncovering a recovery, every act of undressing a redressing. It should be obvious that in this doubly concealed concealment, the exposure of exposing, one can discern something resonant with the nature of eros. In the course of this analysis, the relevance of this remark shall become more evident.A specifi c application of this tenet may be elicited from the teach-ings expounded by medieval kabbalists. It is reasonable to presume that the elusive manner of divulging secrets through allusion satisfi ed a psychological need to reveal and a religious obligation to conceal, that is, to reveal in such a way that the revealing would conceal what was"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"66 elliot r. wolfsonrevealed at the same time that the concealing would reveal what was concealed.1 As Abraham Abulafi a succinctly expressed the matter, “the way of the mouth is to reveal the hidden and to conceal the revealed (legalot ha-nistar u-lekhassot ha-nigleh).”2 A noteworthy formulation of this approach is found in an important text likely to have been composed in the late-thirteenth or early-fourteenth century where a total of 112 esoteric teachings are transmitted as oral traditions received from the elder (zaqen).3 In the context of writing about the mystical signifi cance of the cloud into which God descended and through which the glory was revealed to Moses, the anonymous kabbalist notes, “we mentioned it here as an allusion from the allusions of its secret (be-remez mi-rimzei sodo) in order to hide it (lema‘an hastiro).”4 In other passages from this 1 I have articulated the paradoxical hermeneutic of esotericism in many of my pre-vious publications. For example, see Wolfson, “Occultation of the Feminine”; Abraham Abulafi a, 9–38; “Divine Suffering,” 110–115; Language, Eros, Being, 17–19, 27, 134–135, 222–224, 232–233, 262, 287, 363. The tension between disclosure and concealment in zoharic kabbalah has been explored as well by Liebes, Studies in the Zohar, 26–30. I note, fi nally, that this dialectic was also a critical aspect of Gershom Scholem’s ori-entation, although there are important differences between our approaches and the respective theoretical frameworks that we adopt. Here I simply note that Scholem, in contrast to Liebes, expressed in creative ways an irresolvable tension between the urge to communicate secrets and the apparent impossibility to do so without rendering the esotericism inauthentic. Liebes, by contrast, entertains that kabbalists, at least from the zoharic circle, affi rmed the possibility of a full disclosure of secrets in the messianic era, and thus the tension (or ambivalence) between revealing and concealing is refl ective of living in a messianically charged time before the coming of the messiah (Studies in Zohar, 30). See Biale, “Gershom Scholem’s Ten Unhistorical Aphorisms”; Wolfson, Abraham Abulafi a, 26–29. As I noted in the aforementioned study, Scholem’s view regarding the possibility of an esoteric tradition cannot be separated from his depiction of mystical language as the symbolic communication of the non-communicable. On Scholem’s linguistic mysticism and his approach to symbolism, see Biale, Gershom Scholem, 89–92; Idel, “Zur Funktion von Symbolen bei G.G. Scholem.” Most tellingly, as part of his wrestling with the possibility of an esoteric tradition, Scholem at times questioned the legitimacy of his own participation in disseminating kabbalistic secrets. For recent dis-cussion and citation of some of the relevant sources, see Weidner, “Reading Gershom Scholem,” 213–215. On the critical notion of an esoteric text in Scholem’s worldview, see Biale, Gershom Scholem, 147–162.2 Abulafi a, Maftea ha-Ra{ayon, 69.3 A version of the complete text is extant in MS Oxford, Bodleian Library, 2396, fols. 1b–63b. I am presently preparing an annotated edition based primarily on this manuscript, though I am utilizing as well fragments of the work found in other manu-scripts. The composition has been previously mentioned by a number of scholars. See Scholem, On the Kabbalah and Its Symbolism, 188; Kabbalah, 61 (in that context, Scholem identifi es the zaqen as Moses); Idel, Golem, 111–12; “Introduction,” 36; Wolfson, Through a Speculum, 284 n. 50; “Beyond the Spoken Word,” 182–184 and the relevant notes; Abrams, “The Shekhinah Prays,” 531–532.4 MS Oxford, Bodleian Library 2396, fol. 3b."},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"  murmuring  secrets  67treatise, the written transmission of secrets through allusion is justifi ed by the anxiety of loss, a fear that the traditions would be forgotten.5 The comment that I cited, however, pinpoints the paradox at a more poig-nant spot of juxtaposition: disclosure through allusion serves the twofold purpose of revealing what is concealed, and concealing what is revealed. Thus the secret telling of secrets—in the idiom of Maimonides, com-municating truth in fl ashes6—enables one to divulge mystical truths to worthy recipients while keeping them hidden from the unworthy.In a second extract, the practice of speaking secretly embraces a profounder sense of dissembling. Commenting on the words of Moses to Pharaoh, “we shall not know with what we are to worship the Lord until we arrive there” (Exod 10:26), the anonymous kabbalist writes: “He did not mention a specifi c place, a celebrated country, a recognized city, or a disclosed location that is known to any man, but he simply said ‘there.’ He concealed his knowledge from everyone, and he revealed it, and publicized it to everyone (histir yedi{ato me-ha-kol we-gillah otto u-fi rsamo la-kol ).”7 How can we make sense of the assertion that Moses at the same time concealed and revealed his knowledge from everyone? To be sure, a more politically oriented form of esotericism, to which I have briefl y alluded, turns on adopting a way of communication that reveals the secret to some and hides it from others, but this does not fi t the description of Moses concealing and revealing knowledge indis-criminately to everyone. Clearly, from the standpoint of a binary logic, this is illogical—one either conceals or reveals, one cannot both conceal and reveal at the same time and in the same correlation. And yet, it is exactly this coincidence that we must take up, if we are to comprehend a paradox that has informed kabbalistic thinking on this matter.In this essay, I will not rehash the various assumptions inherent in the duplicitous nature of the secret, a strategy deployed adroitly in the dif-ferent trends of kabbalah, a topic I have discussed at length elsewhere.8 5 Ibid., fols. 7a, 51b–52a, 62b, and see Wolfson, “Beyond the Spoken Word,” 183–184. The rationale for committing esoteric matters to writing in order to prevent forgetful-ness is not unique to this text. See, for instance, Abulafi a, OÉar Eden Ganuz, 179: “Our intention in this book is to make known in it matters that have been received from the prophets that have been forgotten from a long time ago since they were not written in books.” Abulafi a’s remark echoes the opinion expressed by Maimonides, Guide, I.71, 176; III: Introduction, 415.6 Maimonides, Guide, I: Introduction, 7–8; I.34, 78.7 MS Oxford, Bodleian Library 2396, fol. 9a.8 See references cited above, n. 1."},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"68 elliot r. wolfsonInstead, I will mark more carefully the spot where the erotic and esoteric crisscross, so that we may better ascertain the manner in which the secrecy of eros can be discerned from the eros of secrecy, and the eros of secrecy from the secrecy of eros, a reciprocity that prompts a doubling of vision, a re/vision, a secreting of the secret, a concealing of the concealment, the mystery revealed in the veiling of its unveiling.The central place accorded the erotic in kabbalistic teaching is a theme that has been well studied by scholars. I do not think it is an exaggeration to say that at the very center of the kabbalists’ vision—and here, again, I see little value in making distinctions along typological lines, as the central place accorded the erotic is something shared by kabbalists from the different groups, classifi ed by the dominant nomen-clature of contemporary scholarship as theosophic and prophetic, even if we readily admit that the depiction of eros is not monolithic—is an appreciation of eros as imparting, to borrow the evocative terminol-ogy of George Steiner, a grammar of being.9 More specifi c to the mythopoetic sensibility cultivated by many kabbalists is an envisioning of God’s unity in heteroerotic terms, an onto-theological assumption that undergirds the positive valorization of sex as a theurgic means to maintain the balance of forces in the divine and, by extension, in the universe. I am quick to add, however, that the theurgical cannot be separated from the deeply sexual nature of the mystical experience attested in kabbalistic literature. This is not to say that traditional kabbalah celebrates the sexual as such, but, rather, that the modes of rhetoric enlisted to describe the inner workings of the divine, and to account for the ecstatic experiences therewith, are infused with tropes of sexuality.10 Indeed, even gestures of ascetic renunciation, which may be excavated from kabbalistic sources, are expressions of the erotic. As we fi nd in other forms of mystical spirituality, so too in various currents of medieval kabbalah, the intensity of desire is to be measured by the desire not to desire, the most passionate of passions by the passion to be dispassionate.11 From a kabbalistic standpoint, contemplative envi-sioning of God revolves about the belonging-together, or the laying in proximity, of intercourse and discourse, not only two predominant 9 Steiner, After Babel, 39–40. See ibid., 61–64, where kabbalah is discussed explicitly by the author.10 My understanding of the correlation of the sacred and sexual, the mystical and erotic, resonates with the view espoused by Kripal in his writings, especially Kali’s Child and Roads of Excess.11 For more extensive discussion, see Wolfson, Language, Eros, Being, 296–371."},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"  murmuring  secrets  69modalities that structure human experience, as Steiner appreciated, but also two forms that indicate the nature of the divine being, and, indeed, the nature of being more generally.12 The language of eros, one might say, reverberates with the eros of language. As kabbalists have repeatedly taught, the letter is the sign of the fl esh that is the fl esh of the sign. Inscribed therein, one knows the way.Decoding Esotericism: Silence of Not-SpeakingThe path I shall follow begins by attending the link between transmis-sion of the mystery and the verbal gesticulation of the murmur, a course determined by the further assumption that, in the point of their meeting, one may fathom a signifi cant facet of the eroticism that informed kabbalistic doctrine and practice. The link is attested in the rabbinic principle that a matter received in a whisper, even if derived exegetically from a scriptural prooftext, must be conveyed in a whis-per.13 Especially important in this regard is the talmudic interpretation of the expression nevon laash (Isa 3:3), which contextually denotes an expert in charms, as one who has the capacity of understanding one thing from another and, therefore, is worthy of receiving “words of Torah that are given in a whisper (be-laash).”14 The whisper hov-ers between speech and speechlessness, as it is a verbal act, but one that, nonetheless, remains inaudible except to the person to whom it is directly communicated. It is worth noting, in passing, that a man-ner of silent oration—qol dimmat elohim, a locution likely based on the expression qol demamah daqqah in 1 Kings 19:12 to which I shall return below—is associated already in some Qumran fragments with angelic speech.15 Further evidence for the depiction of the liturgical utterance of angels as silent language may be educed from the Aramaic targum 12 See above, n. 8 and the brief discussion in Language, Eros, Being, 118.13 Genesis Rabbah 1:3, 19–20, and parallel sources cited on 19, n. 10; Altmann, “A Note on the Rabbinic Doctrine of Creation”; Scholem, Jewish Gnosticism, 58; Wolfson, “Beyond the Spoken Word,” 173–175; Language, Eros, Being, 521 n. 135.14 Babylonian Talmud, Æagigah 14a.

It is reasonable to surmise, though I cannot prove my conjecture, that at some point the characterization of the angelic mode of liturgical utterance was appropriated and utilized to depict the form of secret talk by which human beings should propagate esoteric wisdom. This surmise is enhanced by the further presumption that angels are privy to cosmological and theological mysteries known to God and on rare occasions revealed to extraordinary human beings, the righteous souls who are transformed and attain an angelic status.Be that as it may, the emphasis on this form of entrusting secrets is all the more striking in light of the fact that the demand to be utterly silent, as opposed to speaking silently, is not unknown in Jewish mysticism, not to mention mystical literature produced in other contexts wherein the apophatic ascent leads the mind to what can be neither known nor spoken.16 If the most serious matters are, as Plato intimated, to remain unspoken (and this includes both verbal and written communication), then it is precisely by not speaking that these matters may be delivered. The unspeakable, in a word, is transmitted without being spoken, for if spoken, it is not the unspeakable that has been transmitted.17 Although Plato seemed to be especially anxious about the written dissemination of secrets, for, as commonsense dictates, what has been committed to writing cannot be unconditionally controlled,18 a concern later expressed by Maimonides as well,19 his philosophical esotericism runs deeper, as he apparently felt that certain topics should not be communicated by either oral or written means.16 For a comparative analysis of this theme, see Williams, Denying Divinity, 84–92, 101–104, 128–134.

Commenting on the rabbinic dictum that it is prohibited to put down in writing words that were communicated orally (Babylonian Talmud, Gi¢¢in 60b), Maimonides wrote that “it was meant to prevent what has ulti-mately come about in this respect: I mean the multiplicity of opinion, the variety of schools, the confusions occurring in the expression of what is put down in writing, the negligence that accompanies what is written down, the divisions of the people, who are separated into sects, and the production of confusion with regard to actions.”"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"  murmuring  secrets  71Here it is benefi cial to recall the words attributed to Aqiva, “silence is a fence for wisdom.”20 Aqiva’s dictum, which may have been inspired textually by Proverbs 17:28, is not connected to esotericism, even though he is portrayed in other contexts as adept in mystical secrets, the most well-known in the rabbinic tale of the four sages who entered Pardes.21 I do not think, however, that it is implausible to suggest that the requirement to be silent with respect to secrets promulgated by other rabbinic sages can be seen as a specifi c application of a more general pietistic sensibility regarding the nexus between wisdom and silence. Thus, for example, we fi nd the following interpretation of “The glory of God is to conceal a matter, and the glory of kings is to search out a matter” (kevod elohim haster davar u-khevod melakhim aqor davar) (Prov 25:2) transmitted in the name of R. Levi: “ ‘The glory of God is to conceal the matter’—before the world was created. ‘And the glory of kings is to search out the matter’—after the world was created.”22 From this exegetical gloss, we may glean evidence that it is appropriate to be silent with regard to the most profound mysteries, secrets that relate to the divine nature prior to creation. The admonition is reiterated in a second tradition preserved in the name of R. Levi, explaining why the world was created with beit, the second letter of the Hebrew alphabet, but the fi rst letter of berexshit, the word with which the Torah begins: “Just as beit is closed on all its sides but open from one side, so you have no permission to seek out what is above, below, before, or after, but only from the day the word was created and forward.”23The reticence to divulge secrets about the account of creation (ma{aseh berexshit) is affi rmed as well with respect to secrets about the account of the chariot (ma{aseh merkavah), two central taxonomies employed by rabbinic scribes to circumscribe the contours of esoteric wisdom. For example, we fi nd the following teaching attributed to R. Aa bar Jacob:20 Mishnah, Avot 3:13; Avot de-Rabbai Natan, version A, ch. 26, 82. On the benefi t of silence for physical well-being, see the tradition transmitted in the name of Simeon ben Gamliel in Mishnah, Avot 1:16; Avot de-Rabbi Natan, version A, ch. 22, 75; Babylonian Talmud, Pesaim 99a.21 The bibliography related to this talmudic tale is rather substantial, and here I will mention only one useful source that incorporates references to various other studies: Bregman, “Introduction.”22 Palestinian Talmud, Æagigah 2:1, 77c.

Until here you have permission to talk, but from there and beyond you have no permission to speak, as it is written in the book of Ben Sira, “Do not seek out what is too enigmatic for you and do not investigate what is concealed from you.” Contemplate that for which you have permission, but you have no business being occupied with hidden matters.24In the same section of the Babylonian Talmud, there is another rabbinic dictum that makes a comparable point about the exposition of matters pertaining to the chariot: “It has been taught with respect to them, ‘Honey and milk are under your tongue’ (Song 4:11), matters that are sweeter than honey and milk should be under the tongue.”25 A similar outlook is expressed in what appears to be a later scribal interpolation that serves as the opening of Heikhalot Zu¢arti,26 a textual unit from the corpus of ancient merkavah mysticism: “Do not investigate the words of your lips, contemplate what is in your heart, and be silent, so that you will merit the beauties of the chariot.”27 Bracketing the provenance of this interpolation, the critical point is that attested therein is the avowal of silent contemplation as the appropriate means to occasion a vision of the divine throne.The need for silence with respect to esoteric matters is reiterated in a passage from the fi rst part of the ancient cosmological work Sefer YeÉirah (a composition that is better described as an aggregate of disparate parts that were assembled over a lengthy period of time and eventually redacted into a text, but still one whose boundaries remained porous),28 where the word belimah in the expression eser sefi rot belimah is rendered midrashically as belom pikha mi-ledabber belom libbekha mi-leharher, “close your mouth from speaking and stop your heart from thinking.”29 We may presume that encoded here is a code of esotericism—perhaps, as 24 Babylonian Talmud, Æagigah 13a.25 Ibid.26 Scholem, Jewish Gnosticism, 77, already surmised that the remarks at the beginning of Heikhalot Zu¢arti “may not constitute an original part of the Urform of the book.”27 Schäfer, Synopse zur Hekhalot-Literatur, §335, 142–143. The thematic link between this passage and the text from Sefer YeÉirah was previously noted by Elior in her annotated edition of Hekhalot Zu¢arti, 60 n. 3.28 For a more detailed discussion with reference to other scholarly treatments, see Wolfson, “Text, Context, and Pretext,” 218–228.29 There are a number of variants connected to this passage including a reversal of the order of the two phrases “mouth” and “heart.” For references see Gruenwald, “A Preliminary Critical Edition,” 142 (section 5); Hayman, Sefer YeÉira, 72–74."},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"  murmuring  secrets  73has been suggested, an oath of secrecy, alluded to as well in the con-tinuation of the passage where reference is made to a covenant (berit) that is decreed in relation to this affair30—which impels the initiate not to discourse about or to meditate on the sefi rot excessively, a stance that was linked by kabbalists at a later period to the verse already crucial to the talmudic tradition mentioned above, kevod elohim haster davar, “The glory of God is to conceal a matter” (Prov 25:2).31 To cite one of numerous examples, the thirteenth-century kabbalist, Azriel of Gerona, commenting on the aforementioned directive in Sefer YeÉirah, remarks that “even with respect to what you have permission to contemplate, ‘Do not allow your mouth to cause your fl esh to sin’ (Eccles 5:5), for it says ‘The glory of God is to conceal the matter.’ ”32 It is possible to interpret this statement politically, that is, silence is necessary to prevent the transmission of secrets to those who are not fi t to receive them, a form of esotericism at work, for instance, in the thought of Maimonides.33 However, it is equally feasible that the issue here is not political, but rather epistemological and ontological, that is, the need to be silent rests on the surmise that the secrets portend the inherently inscrutable dimensions of divine reality, even if permission has been granted to contemplate them. Indeed, the contemplation thereof leads one to the discernment that these are matters beyond comprehension. The citation from Ecclesiastes is also signifi cant, as it brings together indiscretion of the mouth and sin of the fl esh. In the medieval kab-balistic imaginary, especially pronounced in zoharic kabbalah,34 the reserve to hide secrets is juxtaposed to the modesty of covering the genitals, for the inappropriate disclosure of esoteric wisdom is on a par 30 Gruenwald, “Some Critical Notes,” 490. See, more recently, Liebes, Ars Poetica in Sefer Yetsira, 55–56.31 The verse was utilized by other masters of esoteric lore in the Jewish middle ages. See, for instance, the very beginning of Eleazar of Worms, Sodei Razayya ha-Shalem, 1. This part of the text was previously published in the compedium of magical and mystical texts, Sefer Razixel, 7b.32 Azriel of Gerona, Perush le-Sefer YeÉirah, 2:456.

Isaac applied the scriptural idiom of the mouth causing the sin to fl esh to the transgression of explicating matters of the Torah that one did not receive directly from his master, an indiscretion that is linked as well, both thematically and exegetically, to the prohibition against making idols and/or worshipping images.36The nexus between these two elements comes to the fore in the fol-lowing interpretation of the aforecited verse from Proverbs attributed to R. Æiyya in a zoharic homily:“The glory of God is to the conceal a matter,” for a man does not have permission to reveal hidden matters that were not transmitted to be revealed, matters that the Ancient of Days covers, as it says “that they may eat their fi ll and clothe themselves elegantly (Isa 23:18).” “That they may eat their fi ll,” to the place for which there is permission, and not more. And “clothe themselves elegantly” (we-limekhasseh attiq), surely [these words must be applied] to what the Ancient One (attiq) covers (mekhasseh).37The zoharic interpretation of the key term we-limekhasseh attiq is based on the midrashic rendering attested in the talmudic dictum, “What is [the meaning of ] we-limekhasseh attiq? The one who covers matters that the Ancient of Days (attiq yomin) covered. And what are they? Secrets of Torah.”38 In the zoharic context, the Ancient of Days is one of the technical designations of Keter, the fi rst of the ten emanations. From the exegesis transmitted in the name of R. Æiyya, it would seem that these secrets must always be concealed in emulation of the aspect of the Godhead that covers them, the terminus beyond the place about which there is permission to investigate and to converse. This suggestion is supported by the continuation of the zoharic text in which another explanation is offered, an explanation that, I suggest, challenges the perspective implied in the words attributed to R. Æiyya.Another explanation: “That they may eat their fi ll,” these are the comrades who know the ways and paths to go in the way of faith, as is appropriate, 35 It should be noted that also attested in other passages from the zoharic text is the moralistic interpretation of Ecclesiastes 5:5, which explains the mouth causing the fl esh to sin as lewd speech that may lead a man to illicit sexual behavior.

Rather, “and the Ancient One covers,” as it is said, “Do not allow your mouth to cause your fl esh to sin” (Eccles 5:5). In the days of R. Simeon, a man would say to his neighbor, “Open your mouth and let your words shine.”39 After he departed, they would say, “Do not allow your mouth [to cause your fl esh to sin].” In his days, “that the may eat their fi ll,” after he departed, “and the Ancient One covers.” For the comrades were stammering, and the words were not established.40According to this textual layer, a distinction must be made between the status of esoteric knowledge when Simeon ben Yoai is alive and its status after he has expired. In his presence, the code of secrecy could be disbanded, as the master elevates the stature of all those who live in his time, but with his absence the mysteries that were revealed have to be hidden again. This aspect of the zoharic hermeneutic of secrecy has been duly noted in previous scholarship, with particular attention paid to the messianic implications implied thereby,41 but I wish to focus on the view preserved in the name of R. Æiyya. It seems to me that that this view is reiterated in the explication of the phrase from Isaiah 23:18 proffered at the end of the passage: “Another explanation: ‘That they may eat their fi ll,’ in those matters that were revealed; ‘and the Ancient One covers,’ in those matters that are covered.”42 Some matters may be revealed, other matters must be concealed. These are secrets that forever elude our grasp, even in the generation of the supreme master of esoteric lore.The point is reiterated in another zoharic homily where the distinc-tion is made (based, in part, on the language of Deut 29:28) between the revealed matters (niglot) that one has permission to know and to investigate and the concealed matters (nistarot) about which one has no permission to acquire knowledge.43 The admonition against seeking what lies beyond our capacity to seek is linked textually to Ecclesiastes 5:5, that is, the mouth that speaks what cannot be spoken brings about sin to the fl esh. In that context, the apophatic orientation is immediately qualifi ed by the statement that no one has permission to utter or to 39 Babylonian Talmud, Berakhot 22a.40 Zohar 3:105b.

I submit that we can identify in this instance as well two distinct approaches preserved in the zoharic text, one predicated on the assumption that some things are forever beyond human comprehension and another that maintains that R. Simeon is the exception to the rule since he was empowered to disclose mysteries that had been hidden prior to his time and that would not be revealed again until the era of the messiah.As intriguing as is the portrait of Simeon ben Yoai that emerges from these passages, and especially the implicit messianic signifi cance attributed to his role as master of esoteric lore, the other opinion expressed in the Zohar is the one I wish to emphasize, as it sheds light on the erotic nature of secrecy and the secret nature of eros. The mys-teries that the Ancient One conceals can be (un)seen only through a veil, simultaneously seen and not seen, seen precisely because not seen, and not seen precisely because seen. The pursuit of the most recon-dite truths, which can never be apprehended, lures the heart with the greatest enticement, just as in matters of sexual temptation, the object of the gaze becomes more exposed precisely when it is most hidden. Moses de León alludes to this paradox in his commentary on Ezekiel’s chariot vision when he notes that the verse “And Moses approached the thick cloud where God was” (Exod 20:18) indicates that one can-not draw near the sefi rot without a garment, ein lavo lahem beli levush. A double connotation is implied here, though the two meanings can be understood as two sides of the selfsame coin. On the one hand, the statement conveys that one cannot approach the divine emanations without being properly attired, a gesture that has a decidedly erotic connotation in the zoharic symbolism,44 and, on the other hand, the statement also communicates that the emanations cannot be envisioned unless they are garbed in a form by which they appear to be other than what they appear to be, a general tenet that is illustrated by the particular liturgical practice of vocalizing the ineffable name (YHWH) by way of its epithet (Adonai).45 Just as the ineffability of the name is preserved by the epithet by which it is (mis)pronounced, so the form-44 On the erotic connotation of the entry of Moses into the cloud, see the explication of the relevant zoharic text in Wolfson, Through a Speculum, 386–387.45 Moses de León, R.

Analogously, the essence of God’s existence, blessed be he, is concealed and hidden, but through his being conjoined to the inner gradations, he displays his power and his actions, and through his actions his rank is discerned.47De León’s words refl ect the distinction made by Maimonides between the unknowable essence of God’s being and the attributes by which his actions are known,48 but he subverts the distinction by identifying the attributes that disclose the providential power of the divine actions as the “inner gradations” (madregot ha-penimiyyot), that is, the sefi rotic ema-nations, the potencies that reveal the inscrutable essence by concealing it. From an anthropocentric perspective, the task is similarly to emulate this pattern, primarily by exposing the secrets hidden in the Torah by way of the appropriate forms of dissimilitude.49The same point of view is expressed in a different terminological register in the conclusion of the fi rst part of the anonymous Sefer ha-Temunah, the “Book of the Image,” an important and infl uential kab-balistic text whose provenance is still a matter of dispute, though it is likely to have been composed sometime in the fourteenth century:50 46 For a more elaborate discussion of this dimension of kabbalistic hermeneutics, see Wolfson, Language, Eros, Being, 221–224.47 Wolfson, Book of the Pomegranate, 20–21 (Hebrew section).48 The impact of Maimonides on Moses de León is well-established in the intel-lectual portraits of his life proffered by scholars.

As Scholem astutely noted, the kabbalist responsible for this text employed a “highly allusive style that conceals more than it reveals in matters “around 1250,” and, similarly, in On the Kabbalah, 78, he described the book as having “appeared about 1250 in Catalonia.” See Scholem, Messianic Idea, 111, where Sefer ha-Temunah is described as “a mystical treatise written in early thirteenth-century Spain.” But see Scholem, Kabbalah, 52, where this view is modifi ed somewhat by the suggestion that it was composed in the fi rst half of the thirteenth century by a kabbalist living either in Provence or Gerona. See ibid., 120 and 347 (in that context, Scholem asserts more defi nitively that Sefer ha-Temunah “originated in a circle associated with the kab-balists of Gerona.”) See, however, Scholem, Origins of the Kabbalah, 460–461 n. 233, where Scholem accepts the view espoused by Gottlieb and Idel (see the continuation of this note for the more recent opinion expressed by the latter) that Sefer ha-Temunah “was written around 1300.” In that context, moreover, he is more inclined to locate the place of composition in Provence rather than Catalonia (see ibid., 468). For dis-cussion of other texts composed by kabbalists who belonged to the circle surrounding Sefer ha-Temunah, see Scholem, “The Secret of the Tree of Emanation,” 67–70; Gottlieb, Studies in the Kabbala Literature, 570–571.

To highlight the point most critical to this study, we reiterate the admonition near the conclusion: the one who contemplates mysteries 54 Scholem, Origins, 461.

The stipulation to secure the secrets in a seal suggests, moreover, that the interplay of coming-near and pulling-away must be thought from the point of their conjunction and not as oppositional. In this regard, it is noteworthy that the encasement of the mysteries is depicted as the “seal upon a seal.” One might have thought that a single seal would have been suffi cient. What is the import of the rhetorical replication? That the seal must be sealed imparts the sense that the hiddenness must be hidden as the hiddenness exposed as what is hidden. The truth of the secret is disclosed through the guise of the disclosure that is secret. The twofold seal opens the door through which one can enter to behold the mystery of eros from within the eros of mystery.The notion of double secrecy, the secret secreted and thereby uncov-ered as secret, is expanded in the introduction to the third part of the book where the author relates that the “twenty-two supernal and wondrous letters” (kaf-beit otiyyot elyonot we-noraxot) and the “ten closed and hidden emanations” (eser sefi rot segurot we-ne{elamot) were inscribed in the secret of the power of Æokhmah, subtle and greatly con-cealed, without image, form, or boundary on account of the abundance of its subtlety, and they emanated in Binah, and Binah brings them to light in subtle inscriptions and great merit, the thirty-two wondrous paths from which all beings and cycles derive, and the spirit of God is in their midst, and all of them were hidden, sealed, and concealed within Æokhmah.60The description of the thirty-two paths, the ontic source of all beings and of all the historical epochs in which they will be manifest, inscripted without image or form within the depths of the splendor of divine wisdom provides a model to understand the ideal of iteration prof-58 For elaboration, see Wolfson, Language, Eros, Being, 111–115.59 “Secret of the Tree of Emanation,” 73.60 Sefer ha-Temunah, 27a."},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"  murmuring  secrets  81fered in the fi gure of the duplicate seal, the seal that is sealed within the seal, an enfolding that unfolds all that is enfolded in Æokhmah to the attribute of Binah,61 where the entities assume differentiated form, and from there to Tifxeret and A¢arah,62 four of the ten attributes that correspond to the four letters of the name, which comprise all the let-ters of the Hebrew alphabet, the fullness of the divine pleroma. The profundity of the erotic secrecy, which is always at the same time a secret eroticism, proffered in this text is underscored particularly by the notion of alphabetic ciphers that have neither ocular nor acoustic images. In the precise language of the text itself:And in this wondrous Torah that is acquired and that is comprised of the ten emanations . . . everything is written in a supernal language, concealed and very sublime, supernal letters, wondrous and hidden, not understood by an angel or a supernal archon but only by God, may he be blessed, glorious and awesome, blessed be he, who explained them to Moses our master, may peace be upon him, and he informed him of all of their secrets and their matters, and Moses wrote them in his language in the order of the supernal way that is alluded to in the Torah, in the crown-lets, tittles, great and small letters, broken, crooked, folded, straight, vocal and graphic forms, opened and closed sections. All of these supernal, wondrous allusions were concealed, for he did not have the capacity to fi nd a language to write them or any way to stipulate them.6361 In “Secret of the Tree of Emanation,” 74, Æokhmah is identifi ed as the “secret of the world of letters” (sod olam ha-otiyyot). And see ibid., 75, where it is said that in Æokhmah is the “place of the Torah of the letters in [their] forms” (torat ha-otiyyot be-Éiyyurim).62 Sefer ha-Temunah, 28b.63 Ibid., 30a. Consider the following statement in “Secret of the Tree of Emanation,” 72: “Cease from fi nding a true explanation and a reply in his mouth except by way of the wondrous and deep wisdom, the divine wisdom.” According to this text, the secrets are discernible only through divine wisdom, okhmat ha-elohut, a theosophic gnosis that is transmitted exclusively to the Jews, the “holy seed of Israel,” in contrast to the “other nations” for whom the tradition is inaccessible. Hence, the author of this treatise insists that there is no way to explain the hidden matters (devarim ne{elamin) except by this wisdom though he also emphasizes that all forms of knowledge are contained in it: “Everything is unifi ed in the order of the emanation of the ten sefi rot, for there is no wisdom, great or small, that does not emerge from there and that is comprised therein, and it is called the world-to-come, the good and elongated world, the eternal world, the awesome world, exceedingly hidden and elevated.” (73) The radical difference between Israel and the nations of the world, a common theme affi rmed by kabbalists through the generations (see extensive documentation of this point in Wolfson, Venturing Beyond, 17–128), is expressed in another passage in the “Secret of the Tree of Emanation,” 78: “In the secret of the fi rst unleavened bread (maÉÉah rixshonah) alluded to in the river Chebar (nehar kevar) (Ezek 1:1), and thus [it says] ‘all who are uncircumcised will not eat of it’ (Exod 12:48), for no shell shall derive pleasure from it, as it is wholly of the river that already was and there is no foreskin or closing of the heart there.”"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"82 elliot r. wolfsonThe matter is reiterated in slightly different terms in a passage in the aforementioned Sod Illan ha-AÉilut where the ultimate unity in which the ten sefi rot are incorporated is described as follows:Thus you must know that there is no form [temunah] or image [dimyon] there, no measure [middah] or computation [eshbon], no face [panim] or back [aor], no upper [elyon] or lower [taton], but there is discrete unity [yiud meyuad ], holy [qadosh] and sanctifi ed [mequddash], awesome [nora] and majestic [adir], lofty [nisgav] and hidden [ne{elam], concealed [nistar] and elevated [na{aleh] above every other creature in this cycle.64From the perspective of the world of creation (olam ha-berixah), the unity of the realm of emanation (aÉilut) is fractured and hence it is perceived under the guise of binary opposites—left/right, up/down, front/back, mercy/judgment, inside/outside, pure/impure, distant/proximate—but from the perspective of the divine all divisions are integrated into the attribute (middah) thatis consumed in its being to the [ point of ] the unifi cation of being for all of them [ha-mitballa{at be-hawwayatah ad be-yiud hawwayah le-khullam], a wondrous, concealed, and hidden name, lofty and elevated in the Infi nite [shem nora we-nistam we-ne{elam nisgav we-na{aleh be-ein sof ], beginning [and] end for all of them [roxsh [we-]sof 65 le-khullam].66A proper analysis of the consumption of all things in the Infi nite, the topos of apocatastasis well known from kabbalistic compositions as well as mystical literature in other religious cultures, will have to await a separate study, but the crucial point to underscore here is the depic-tion of the concealed name so sublime that it is devoured in the silent mystery of the Cause of Causes (illat ha-illot), the indifferent one that is the commencement and terminus of all that exists in the continuous chain of differentiated being. Needless to say, the image of consump-tion deployed in this citation suggests a loss of identity that has obvious erotic overtones. To be even more precise, it is said of Keter, which is characterized as the “fi rst” of the ten utterances of creation (maxamar ri’shon) or as the “fi rst” of the ten words of revelation (dibbur rixshon), that it has no place (ein lo maqom) and consequently that it is not included in 64 “Secret of the Tree of Emanation,” 72.65 I have accepted Scholem’s suggestion, “Secret of the Tree of Emanation,” 73 n. 17a, to emend the text from roxsh sof to roxsh we-sof.66 Ibid., 73."},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"  murmuring  secrets  83the enumeration (eshbon) of the sefi rot,67 but it is nonetheless depicted as beginning and end; indeed, in this ultimate state of ontological indifference, future and past meet in the compresence of the moment at hand, a point that is conveyed as well by the fact that this attribute, also called the “supernal supplement” (musaf elyon) for the increase (tosefet) of the divine effl ux overfl ows from it to the other emanations, the “supernal appointed times” (mo{adim elyonim), is designated by the appellation “Ehyeh” and identifi ed as the “root of the river Khebar.” The former, the name of God revealed to Moses at the epiphany of the burning bush (Exod 3:14), denotes what shall be, and the latter, the place in Babylonia where Ezekiel had his vision of the heavenly chariot (Ezek 1:1), signifi es by a play on words (kevar, which means “previous,” but it is also the proper name of the river) what has come to pass.68 The import of this wordplay is underscored by another title assigned in this text to Keter, the “light that has been” (or kevar), a turn of phrase based on the rabbinic idea that a portion of the primordial light was stored away for the righteous in the eschaton. It is likely, as Scholem has already suggested, that the biblical and rabbinic idioms are meant to be joined together insofar as the Hebrew nahar can be linked philologically to the Aramaic nehora, which means “light.”69 If we accept this sugges-tion, and I think it reasonable to do so, then nehar kevar, literally, the “river Chebar,” can be transposed into or kevar, the “light that has been 67 Ibid., 75. On the virtual identity of Keter and Ein Sof, see Sefer ha-Temunah, 38b: “All of these wonders issue from the potency of Keter, for there is the true unity and the infi nite limit of his essence, in Keter is his unity and his essence, and he is called ‘Ein Sof ’ inasmuch as he is the innermost interiority (tokh tokho) of Keter, as there is no limit (she-ein sof ) to his comprehension that is there, and from there and within there is the essence of his unity, and from Ein Sof will be comprehended the essence of his light, his splendor, and the limit of his unity . . . for everything from the unity of Ein Sof, and his secret and his mystery that are there, and this is the secret of the thirteen concealed gradations, and this is the Sabbath, the repose of all the Sabbaths, holidays, and appointed times, the one Sabbath that is called ‘peace’ in truth, the single unity, for everything comes in peace, the lights and souls, and in truth and in peace all is one unity.” See ibid., 45b.68 “Secret of the Tree of Emanation,” 74. In that context, the author further describes Keter, Tifxeret, and Malkhut, also referred to as the three beings (hawwayot) and demar-cated respectively by the names Ehyeh, YHWH, and Adonai, as the “essence of all the emanation” (iqqar kol ha-aÉilut). The three names are contrasted in the following way: Ehyeh is “hidden and concealed in its pronunciation and in its scripting,” YHWH “is written but not pronounced except through its epithets,” and Adonai “is pronounced and it is seen.” On the hiddenness of YHWH in the name Ehyeh, which is said to be beyond all knowledge and beyond any discernable name, see Sefer ha-Temunah, 70a.69 Ibid., 74 n. 24."},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"84 elliot r. wolfsonbeforehand.” The confl uence of opposites in Keter yields the ideational structure that underlies the kabbalistic conception of time as a circular linearity—a present determined concurrently by the past of the future that is yet to come as what has already been and by the future of the past that has already been what is yet to come.70 Language here falters as the notion of temporality can be properly enunciated only through the withdrawal of speech that bespeaks the annihilation of thought at the point of its fullest realization.As a fi nal illustration of the role accorded silence in kabbalistic esotericism, I cite a passage from the commentary on the Torah by Baya ben Asher that forges a synthesis between the negative theology embraced by Maimonides and the code of secrecy attested in Jewish esotericism.71 The relevant comment appears as an elucidation of the scriptural decree “Know therefore this day and keep in mind that the Lord alone is God in heaven above and on earth below, there is no other” (Deut 4:39):This is a positive commandment from the Torah regarding the knowledge of God, blessed be he, for we are commanded to know him, to investigate about his unity, and not to rely solely on tradition. This knowledge is from his actions and wondrous deeds, the lower and upper created beings. Thus this knowledge is [of ] the contingent [ha-efsharit], but knowledge from the aspect of his substance [mahuto] and essence [aÉmuto] is inaccessible, and it is impossible to attain it, and concerning it is said “The glory of God is to the conceal the matter” (Prov 25:2). Since the matter of divinity [inyan ha-elohut] is not comprehended by man through his intellect in the beginning of his thought the expression “keep in mind” [wa-hashevota el levavekha] is mentioned in relation to it, like a man who contemplates something and he must go back and contemplate, as we fi nd in the case of Elijah: “[And lo, the Lord passed by. There was a great and mighty wind, splitting mountains and shattering rocks by the power of the Lord;] but the Lord was not in the wind. After the wind—an earthquake; but the Lord was not in the earthquake. After the earthquake—fi re; but the Lord was not in the fi re. After the fi re—a soft murmuring sound” (1 Kings 19:11–12). The matter of what is written: when a man thinks about him, whether he is wind, or an earthquake, or fi re, he goes back and closes the edifi ce of his mind with respect to everything he thinks about him, and after all of the thoughts he will fi nd nothing but concealment [ha{alamah] and ineffability [belimah], and this [the import of the words] “After the 70 This aspect of kabbalistic thought is elaborated in Wolfson, Alef, Mem, Tau, 87–98.71 For a more extensive discussion of this topic, see Wolfson, “Via Negativa in Maimonides.”"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"  murmuring  secrets  85fi re—a soft murmuring sound,” in accordance with the matter that was mentioned in Sefer YeÉirah,72 “Close your mouth from speaking and your heart from thinking” [belom pikha mi-ledabber we-libbekha mi-leharher].73This passage well demonstrates the genuine tension between the kata-phatic orientation of scriptural faith, on one hand, and the apophatic orientation of the medieval theological perspective, on the other. The confl ictual tug is resolved to some degree by appeal to the Maimonidean approach, that is, the injunction to know God is limited to apprehension of the contingent beings of the cosmos, whereas knowledge of the divine essence is not available to the human mind. The thirteenth-century kabbalist from Saragossa thus interprets the sequence of images from Elijah’s epiphany on Mount Carmel in a manner that accords with the negative theology of Maimonides. Apropos of the above discus-sion regarding the exegetical link of the gesture of the whisper to the scriptural elocution qol demamah daqah, it is important to emphasize that in Baya’s mind the “soft murmuring sound” denotes the cessation of thought, the “concealment” and “ineffability” that marks the culmina-tion of the path, the silence that re/sounds after the wind, earthquake, and fi re. The philosophical insight is supported by the mystical directive in Sefer YeÉirah to close one’s mouth from speaking and one’s heart from thinking about the sefi rot.Whispering Secrets: Dispelling Mysteries of Torah In contrast to these statements that implore the adept to be quiet, there was another strategy advocated by some kabbalists, a tactic connected to the rabbinic stipulation to transmit secrets in a whisper, a form of speaking silently. With respect to this type of speech, as opposed to an unmitigated silence, we can grasp another component of the intimate nexus between the esoteric and erotic. Here it is worth recalling the comment of Hai Gaon, a leading fi gure in the rabbinic academy of Pumbedita in the tenth and eleventh centuries, on the talmudic instruc-tion that secret matters be transmitted in a whisper: “They whisper to him in whispers, give him the principles, he understands them, and from 72 See above, n. 29.73 Rabbenu Baya, 3:268."},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"86 elliot r. wolfsonheaven they show him the mysteries of the heart.”74 Medieval masters of esoteric lore elaborated and embellished this notion of communicat-ing secrets in a murmur. As an illustration, I will mention a passage in the fi rst part of the compendium of mystical doctrines Sodei Razayya composed by Eleazar of Worms, the thirteenth-century Rhineland Jewish pietist. According to this text, the secret of the chariot (sod ha-merkavah), which is associated with three distinct literary compositions, Sefer ha-Merkavah, Sefer YeÉirah, and Sefer ha-Qomah, can be revealed only in a murmur (be-laash or bi-leishah).75 Eleazar does not indicate either explicitly or implicitly that the esotericism surrounding the chariot entails an erotic dimension. This possibility cannot be ignored, however, given comments scattered about in the works of Eleazar as well as in other pietistic writings that overtly utilize sexual symbolism to discuss the nature and experience of the chariot.76The connection between esotericism and eroticism is made more openly by Spanish kabbalists who were active in the second half of the thirteenth century. Consider, for example, the following statement in Abraham Abulafi a’s Æayyei ha-Nefesh, one of the three commentaries he wrote on The Guide of Perplexed by Maimonides:77In the beginning of creation were contained three types of transgression, idolatry, illicit sexual relations, and murder.78 These three are also found 74 OÉar ha-Geonim, 4:12 (Hebrew). The text was cited by Scholem, Jewish Gnosticism, 58 n. 10, and see Wolfson, “Beyond the Spoken Word,” 215 n. 82; Idel, “The Concept of Torah,” 39 n. 41; “Secrecy, Binah and Derishah,” 326–327.75 Eleazar of Worms, Sodei Razayya ha-Shalem, 115.76 A number of scholars have dealt with this issue, and here I will offer a modest sampling of the relevant studies: Farber, “The Concept of the Merkabah”; Wolfson, “The Image of Jacob” (revised English version published in Wolfson, Along the Path, 1–62); Abrams, Sexual Symbolism and Merkavah Speculation.77 On the impact of Maimonides on Abulafi a, see Scholem, Major Trends, 126, 138–139, 383 n. 76; Kabbalah of Sefer ha-Temunah, 107, 127–128, 151–152; Idel, “Mai-monides and Kabbalah”; “Maimonides’ Guide of the Perplexed.” See also other references to Idel cited below, n. 83, and Altmann, “Maimonides’s Attitude.”78 These three sins are often classifi ed together in rabbinic literature to signify car-dinal acts of impiety. To mention some examples, the three sins are singled out as the transgressions through which exile and destruction come to the world (Mishnah, Avot 5:9; Tosefta, Menaot 13:4; Babylonian Talmud, Yoma 9b; Avot de-Rabbai Natan, version A, ch. 38, p. 115; Massekhet Kallah, ch. 8; Numbers Rabbah 7:10), the sins for which one must be prepared to die rather than to violate (Babylonian Talmud, Sanhedrin 74a), or as the only sins that cancel out the permission, indeed the obligation, to transgress for the sake of saving a life (Tosefta, Shabbat 10:14; Babylonian Talmud, Yoma 82a, Ketuvot 19a). See also Tosefta, Nedarim 2:6; So¢ah 6:3, Bava MeÉi{a 6:6; Babylonian Talmud, Pesaim 25a–b, Yoma 67b, Sanhedrin 56b, Shavu{ot 7b, Erkhin 15b; Genesis Rabbah 31:6, 41:7; Exodus Rabbah 16:2, 42:1.

And this in order to overturn what was created corresponding to the fi nal divine intention [ha-kawwanah ha-elohit ha-aronah], and this is the fi rst natural intention [ha-kawwanah ha-¢iv{it ha-rixshonah], for the natural intention, which is the account of creation [ma{aseh berexshit], is to preserve the species perpetually and to maintain its particulars, the attribute of a single time [middat zeman ead ] through the intermediary of the uncovering of the genitals [gilluy arayot]. And the divine intention, which is the account of the chariot [ma{aseh merkavah], is to sustain the unique individual [ha-ish ha-meyuad ] perpetually by means of the disclosure of secrets [gilluy nistarot], which are like the uncovering of the genitals in the case of the multitude of the species [ha-hamon ha-miniyyim],79 lewd matters to speak about and concerning which it is not appropriate to listen like words pertaining to illicit sexual relations [ke-divrei arayot], and they are the essence and the rest is secondary.

When one of the necessary and benefi cial commandments of the commandments, which are for the sake of the welfare of the body [tiqqun ha-guf ] or for the welfare of the soul [tiqqun ha-nefesh], is revealed, the revealed [ha-nigleh] is a key to open the gates of the hidden [sha{arei ha-nistar] . . . for rectifi cation of the body is preparation for rectifi cation of the soul, and rectifi cation of the soul is preparation for the fi nal perfection, which is the goal of the fi nal divine intention, and this is comprehension of the name [hassagat ha-shem].80list of the seven Noachide laws, the rabbinic classifi cation that embraces some notion of a universal moral law that is foundational for human society in general and not exclusively for the covenantal community of Israel. See Tosefta, Avodah Zarah 9:4; Babylonian Talmud, Sanhedrin 56a.79 The adjectival form miniyyim is derived from min, which can denote either the species or the sexual. It is reasonable to presume that Abulafi a had both connotations in mind.80 Abulafi a, Æayyei ha-Nefesh, 15. For an earlier translation and explication of a sec-tion of this passage, see Wolfson, Abraham Abulafi a, 190–193, and for an alternative analysis, in part inspired as a response to my own discussion, see Idel, “Kabbalistic Interpretation,” 160–162."},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"88 elliot r. wolfsonThe Abulafi an text can be read as an interpretive gloss on a number of philosophical claims by Maimonides. To begin with there is the correspondence made between the account of creation and physics, on the one hand, and the account of the chariot and metaphysics, on the other. For Abulafi a, the rabbinic classifi cations allude respectively to the natural and divine intentions, the former characterized as the impetus to maintain the existence of the species and of the particulars comprised within them, and the latter as the impulse to sustain the existence of unique individuals. The natural intention is identifi ed, moreover, with gilluy arayot, the disclosure of secrets that are linked exegetically to the delineation of illicit sexual relations in the eighteenth chapter of Leviticus, which together with ma{aseh berexshit and ma{aseh merkavah are the subjects designated by tannaitic authorities as too dangerous to be divulged publicly.81 It seems to me, however, that Abulafi a employed the term in a way that was closer to an alternative connotation of “uncov-ering the genitals” attested in rabbinic literature,82 which is based, in turn, on the scriptural expression legallot erwah, “to uncover nakedness,” (Lev 18:2) the root eryah signifying that which is without garment. This is also the import of the comment that the “secret of circumcision” (sod ha-milah) is the “beginning of the creation of the species and its perpetual existence,” the word “circumcision” obviously denoting in this context the male organ upon which the ritual cut is performed.Abulafi a thus draws an analogy between two forms of denuding, uncovering the genitals and exposing secrets, the former associated with the account of creation, which is revealed to the masses, and the latter with the account of the chariot, which is set aside for unique individuals. The preservation of the species quite literally depends on the former and hence gilluy arayot fulfi ls the fi rst natural intention. But this inter-pretation relates only to the external level, the chaff that is disclosed for the multitude; the internal meaning or the wheat consists of the secrets that are revealed exclusively to select individuals ( yeidim). The point is reiterated when Abulafi a notes that the “mysteries of Torah,” which are the secrets said in a murmur and are known by the intellect with an abundance of thought,83 are hidden from the multitude. He 81 See Wolfson, Abraham Abulafi a, 192–195; Idel, “Kabbalistic Interpretation,” 155–185.82 Tosefta, So¢ah 6:3.83 Abulafi a’s insistence that the mysteries “are known by the intellect with an abun-dance of thought” refl ects his view that kabbalistic truths are linked to the overfl ow that ensues from the Active Intellect, which is personifi ed in the ecstatic vision principally in"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"  murmuring  secrets  89adds that “all the hidden matters attest to the two inclinations,” a tacit reference to the imagination and intellect.84 Abulafi a does not disclose in this context the esoteric import of the secrets that are connected to the illicit sexual relations, but from other treatises that he composed, and especially a passage from his Æayyei ha-Olam ha-Ba,85 we can assert that the mysteries pertaining to arayot refer to the allegorical repre-sentation of form and matter, which are associated respectively with Adam and Eve. This is implied as well in the connection that Abulafi a draws between sitrei arayot and the aggadic theme of the serpent having intercourse with Eve.86In the conclusion of the aforecited passage from Æayyei ha-Nefesh, Abu-lafi a establishes a hierarchy based on another teaching of Maimonides concerning the twofold purpose of the law, the welfare of the body and the welfare of the soul.87 Abulafi a’s reworking of the Maimonidean view yields three perfections, which correspond to body, soul, and intellect.88 The ritual performance of the commandment, which encompasses the two goals specifi ed by Maimonides, constitutes the revealed aspect that is appropriate for the consumption of the populace, but the revealed aspect opens the gates of the hidden aspect, which corresponds to the fi nal perfection, the comprehension of the name that is ascertained exclusively by the elite. There are many important themes in this text that can be clarifi ed only by an intertextual analysis with other writings of Abulafi a, a task that lies beyond the scope of this study. What is most important to underscore for our purposes is Abulafi a’s acceptance of the older tradition that the proper way to transmit secrets is through the still the fi gure of Metatron. As Idel (Absorbing Perfections, 400) noted, Abulafi a, in contrast to a kabbalist like Namanides, rarely mentions an explicit reception of an oral tradition from an actual master. The point I have made independently corroborates this claim. Nevertheless, it must be borne in mind that the technique of letter-combination and the prophetic experience occasioned thereby advocated by Abulafi a is a level of attain-ment that exceeds the discursive thought embraced by philosophers. On this point, see Scholem, Kabbalah, 54; Altmann, “Maimonides’s Attitude,” 207–209; Idel, “Sitre {Arayot in Maimonides’ Thought,” 89; “Abulafi a’s Secrets of the Guide.”84 As noted by Idel, “Kabbalistic Interpretation,” 161 n. 507.85 Abulafi a, Æayyei ha-Olam ha-Ba, 7–10. For an annotated citation and analysis of the text, see Idel, “Kabbalistic Interpretation,” 155–157. See also Abulafi a, Sitrei To r a h, 69–70.86 For translation of the relevant passage, see Wolfson, Abraham Abulafi a, 194.87 Maimonides, Guide, III.27, pp. 510–11; Galston, “The Purpose of the Law.”88 On the delineation of three human perfections corresponding to body, soul, and intellect, see Abulafi a, Shomer MiÉwah, 24, cited by Idel, “Kabbalistic Interpretation,” 161 n. 514."},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"90 elliot r. wolfsonspeech of the murmur.89 However, it must be pointed out that several passages in Abulafi a’s corpus indicate that he interpreted the gesture of the whisper in a novel way (though he may have been infl uenced in part by Maimonides)90 as a reference to a technical meditative tech-nique, an idea he supports by the fact that the consonants of be-laash, “in quiet,” can be rearranged to spell laashov, “to contemplate.”91 For Abulafi a, therefore, the notion that secrets are transmitted in a whisper is not to be interpreted literally, but rather as a fi gurative expression of the contemplative ideal. The distinctiveness of Abulafi a’s approach is brought into sharp relief when we compare it, for example, to the insistence in the anonymous text to which I referred above wherein the kabbalistic secrets attributed to the zaqen must be transmitted in a whisper.92 There is no reason to interpret the relevant comments from this treatise fi guratively; on the contrary, one of the fascinating aspects of this text is that it seems to preserve the behavior of an actual fraternity 89 See Æayyei ha-Olam ha-Ba, 76, where it is emphasized that the name is transmitted in a whisper (be-laash) just as it has been received. On the need to transmit the divine names in this manner, see also Sitrei Torah, 77, and Shomer MiÉwah, 32 (in that context, the matter is connected with humility, which is depicted as the supreme virtue that comprises all other virtues).90 In Guide, I.34, p. 78, Maimonides interprets whispering as the capacity to give a “concise and coherent expression of the most hidden notions.” Maimonides thus understands the whisper in a fi gurative way and in this respect Abulafi a may have been indebted to him even though the substance of the latter’s explanation is differ-ent. Concerning the interpretation of Maimonides, see Klein-Braslavy, King Solomon, 94–96. The author suggests that it is reasonable to conclude that the affi rmation of the whisper (laash) on the part of Maimonides as the way to transmit mysteries of Torah refl ects the passage about Simeon bar YehoÉadaq and Samuel bar Naman in Genesis Rabbah 1:3 (see above, n. 13). While I concur that it is likely that Maimonides had this text in mind, this should not obfuscate the fact that the medieval sage interpreted the rabbinic idea of incantation fi guratively.91 Abulafi a, OÉar Eden Ganuz, 48. In that passage, Abulafi a connects the saying of the Shema, the traditional confession of Israel’s monotheistic faith (Deut 6:4), with the ideal of ascetic piety, that is, only one who has withdrawn from the desires of the material world can properly unify the name of divine unity. Following the rabbinic ritual, moreover, he writes about the need to utter silently the phrase barukh shem kevod malkhuto le{olam wa{ed. Abulafi a glosses the expression be-laash as laashov libbo be-khaw-wanah, “his heart should contemplate with intention.” On the need to praise the name of the glory silently and openly, leshabea shem kevodo be-laash u-ve-gilluy, see Abulafi a, Sefer ha-Ot, 30. See also Abulafi a, Æotam ha-Haf¢arah, 109.

A crucial practice attested in this treatise was the communication of mystical doctrine through the whisper, and therefore comments such as the one that a particular secret connected to sacrifi ces is too deep to be comprehended except by one who hears the matter received orally from the elder93 are to be taken quite plainly—the mystical truth is whispered by the master into the ear of the worthy disciple.94 In contrast to the silence of not-speaking, the speech of the murmur yields an erotic texture that is not embodied in the paradox of a secret that must be hidden if it is the secret that is revealed, but in the sensual transmission of the secret from mouth to ear, a diffusion of truth that partakes of the timbre of eros displayed in the stillness of the muted word.Gestural Unsaying/Envisioning Silence In the concluding section of this study, I will focus in greater detail on the juxtaposition of three elements that have shaped the contours of esotericism in medieval kabbalah, to wit, the whisper, the secret, and the erotic. It is instructive that this mode of dissemination is appropriated by kabbalists and made especially explicit by the Castilian kabbalists of the late-thirteenth and early-fourteenth centuries responsible for the early stages of the literary production and redaction of what may be called the zoharic canon (sifrut ha-zohar),95 as an acceptable manner to converse about divine sexuality, the sacred union of the male and female through the medium of the phallus. The analysis of the particular motif that I have proposed should shed light on the intertwining of eros and the esoteric in the religious philosophy that may be elicited from zoharic texts, a philosophical sensibility that had a signifi cant impact on subsequent generations of kabbalistic productivity.Let me begin by noting that several zoharic passages simply reiterate the rabbinic contention that secretive matters—and in some contexts these are related more specifi cally to prophecy or to the muse of the 93 MS Oxford, Bodleian Library 2396, fol. 6b.94 Ibid., fol. 7a.95 For some studies that deal with the historical and literary history of the Zohar, see Scholem, Major Trends, 156–204; Tishby, The Wisdom of the Zohar, 1–126; Liebes, Studies in the Zohar, 85–138; Huss, “Sefer ha-Zohar as a Canonical, Sacred and Holy Text”; “The Appearance of Sefer ha-Zohar”; Mopsik, “Le corpus Zoharique”; Abrams, “Critical and Post-Critical Textual Scholarship,” 61–64; “The Zohar as a Book”; Meroz, “Zoharic Narratives”; Giller, Reading the Zohar, 3–33."},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"92 elliot r. wolfsonholy spirit—are transmitted in a whisper.96 One text, in particular, is noteworthy as it illustrates the tension that the medieval kabbalist would have likely felt between upholding the traditional emphasis on concealing secrets and the impulse to share them so that they may be preserved for posterity.97R. Simeon wept and said, “One word from those words whispered to me [millin di-leishu li ] from the head of the academy of Paradise that were not said openly [be-itgalyya], this word is a mystery [sitra], and I will say to you, my beloved sons, my sons, the beloved ones of my soul, what shall I do? They said it to me in a whisper [bi-leisha] but I will say it to you openly [be-itgalyya], and in the future when we see one another face-to-face, all the faces will rely on this.”98The master reveals overtly the secret he had received in a whisper, and the ostensibly transgressive act is transformed into a sign of initiation. The author of this passage has captured concisely the hermeneutical dilemma (expressed by Maimonides as well99) on the part of the master confronted with the urge to disclose and the injunction to hide, which is voiced in several other places in zoharic literature in the words “Woe if I reveal, woe if I do not reveal!”100 On the face of it, the whisper would seem to allow one to occupy the space between these two inclinations, as it is a form of disclosure that is at the same time a form of concealment. Yet, in the aforementioned passage, R. Simeon cannot contain himself, and thus he reveals openly what he received clandestinely through a whisper.In other passages scattered in the zoharic topography, the cryptic gesture of whispering the secret is framed in a more complex theosophic manner. As an illustration I will cite a key excerpt that is marked as belonging to the Tosefta stratum.101 96 Zohar 1:217a; 2:130b, 179b. 97 On the tension between disclosure and concealment in zoharic kabbalah as it pertains specifi cally to a messianic theosophy, see Liebes, Studies in the Zohar, 26–30. 98 Zohar 2:190b.

A pleasant voice ascends and descends, it goes forth and roams the world. The voice of the ram’s horn extends in the depths of the gradations and it causes the sphere to spin round. Two pipes are placed from the right and left in two colors that emanate together,102 one white and the other red. Both of them rotate the sphere above, when it turns to the right the white ascends, and when it turns to the left the red descends. The sphere rotates continuously and it does not rest. Two birds ascend when they chirp, one to the south side, and the other to the north side, they fl y through the air. The chirping and the pleasant voice of the sphere join together, concerning which [it is written] “A psalm, a song for the sabbath day” (Ps 92:1). All the bless-ings issue forth in the murmur of this sound from the love of the voice of the ram’s horn. Corresponding to these the blessings descend from above to below and they are concealed as one within the depth of the well, the spring of the well, which does not cease, in a murmur until the rotating sphere is fi lled.103 It lies beyond the scope of this study to decode all of the intricate details implied in this text. What is most important for the main focus of this analysis, however, is the assertion that the blessings ascend from below in a murmur that is incited by the sound of the ram’s horn, and the further claim that the blessings from above similarly come forth in a murmur from the depth of the well (umqa de-veira),104 a symbolic reference to Binah, whence the lower seven sefi rot emanate. To be more precise, the blessings are said to issue from the spring of the well (nevi{u de-veira), a technical expression that I propose refers more specifi cally to the womb of Binah,105 which is characterized in zoharic literature and other kabbalistic sources in decidedly phallic terms.106 The issu-ing forth of all blessings from this attribute of the divine pleroma in a murmur—and I note, parenthetically, that in other zoharic passages instruction is given to the worshipper to direct the intention of the heart to this depth of the well in order to draw down the blessings 102 Literally, “are drawn forth, one with the other” (mishtaxavin da be-da).

In a very precise sense, then, this murmur can be demarcated as the sound of silence that engenders the silence of sound. The letters are depicted, moreover, as the substance of the seminal overfl ow that Binah receives from Æokhmah.119 In a number of zoharic homilies, the effl ux of divine light is portrayed fi guratively as the overfl ow of seed from thought (Æokhmah), the Primordial Torah, whence comes forth the inaudible voice, which is also troped as inscrip-tion (ketav or ketivah); that voice, the sound of the ram’s horn (shofar), reverberates in turn and fractures further into discrete phonemes and and the Acquisition of Language, xi–xxxii, and for more expansive analyses see Madison, The Phenomenology of Merleau-Ponty, 108–144; Burke, “Listening at the Abyss”; Bucher, Zwischen Phänomenologie und Sprachwissenschaft.117 For an analysis of several typological forms of silence exemplifi ed in works of Jewish mysticism, see Æallamish, “On Silence in Kabbalah and Hasidism”.

But when they gather upon her, she is heard in all of the worlds and they all tremble from her.” This characterization of Malkhut corresponds to the standard kabbalistic depiction of the last of the emanations as the attribute that has no light or substance except for what she refl ects and absorbs from the potencies above her.119 Zohar 1:15b."},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"96 elliot r. wolfsongraphemes—the phonological and grammatological should not be conceived as independent aspects, but rather as two forms of one phenomenon—manifest in Tifxeret, the “audible voice” (qol de-ishtema) that is the script of the Written Torah, and Malkhut, the “speech” (dib-bura) declaimed in the ongoing interpretative narration that makes up the collective body of the Oral Torah.120 With respect to both Binah, the “great voice,” and Tifxeret, the “voice that is heard,” we detect a coalescence of the auditory and visual,121 and hence we can describe the emanative process in either acoustic or ocular terms.122 This should alert us to the diffi culty of casting the traditional kabbalistic scheme in terms of the contemporary distinction (largely indebted to Derrida) between the grammatological and logocentric. From the hermeneuti-cal standpoint of medieval kabbalah, the graphic and oral cannot be severed, as every act of writing is simultaneously a spoken declamation, and every spoken declamation an act of writing.In the citation that has been transmitted as part of the Tosefta stra-tum of the zoharic compilation, the gesture of the whisper is linked symbolically to Binah, the “soft murmuring sound” beyond imaginal or 120 See Tishby, Wisdom, 293. A particularly interesting formulation of this notion is found in Moses de León, Perush Yod-Gimmel Middot, MS New York, Jewish Theological Seminary of America 1609, fols. 130b–131a.121 A striking example of the convergence of epistemic modes is found in the description of the knowledge of the “voice that is heard” (qol de-ishtema) through the “vision of the holy spirit” (ezyona de-rua qudsha) in Zohar 2:43b (Piqqudin). In that con-text, the unity of the threefold in the audible voice, which corresponds to Tifxeret, is linked exegetically to the three occurrences of the divine name in Deuteronomy 6:4, the traditional proclamation of the monotheistic faith. Regarding this passage and other trinitarian formulations in zoharic literature, see Jellinek, Beiträge zur Geschichte der Kabbala, 2: 51–56; Tishby, Wisdom, 973–974; Liebes, Studies in the Zohar, 140–145. See also Wolfson, Language, Eros, Being, 257–258. It is of interest to point out the con-nection that is drawn in the aforementioned passage from the Piqqudin section of the Zohar between the divine attribute depicted symbolically as the “voice” and the actual voice of the worshipper who recites the verse liturgically. The proper intention that one must have when one articulates the Shema is to unify the divine from “the Infi nite to the end of everything” (me-ein sof ad sofa de-khola). The verbal gesture is complimented by a meditative practice of an ocular nature, the seeing of interior colors through the “vision of the closed eye” (eizu de-eina setima).

Moses de Leon’s Commentary, 60. In the same context, de León also interprets the word ashmal as a reference to the “beasts” (ayyot), i.e., the central sefi rot of Æesed, Din, and Raamim, that are unifi ed within Binah. See ibid., 66 and 67 (in that context, the unifi cation of the beasts is symbolically encoded in the name YAHDWNHY, which is formed by a combination of the Tetragrammaton and its epithet, YHWH and ADNY. It is worth noting as well that de León (Farber-Ginat’s Commentary, 66) utilizes the scriptural locution demut ha-ayyot, “image of the beasts” (Ezek 1:13), to distinguish between the “supernal beasts” ayyot ha-elyonot, that are “stripped of every matter” (nishlalot mi-kol davar) and hence beyond visual contemplation, and the lower beasts that can be seen in accordance with the capacity of the one who contemplates them. Presumably, the “supernal beasts” denote the supernal sefi rotic potencies whereas the “lower beasts” are the refraction of the upper ones in Malkhut or perhaps the angelic beings in the realm beneath the world of the emanations. See ibid., 67, where the supernal beasts, also identifi ed as the “splendor of the speculum that shines” (zohar aspaqlarya ha-mex irah), are described as being visually comprehended through rotating the closed eye (see above, n. 121). The fl eeting vision that results from this rather simple technique is compared to the refl ection of the sunlight upon a dish of water, images that are meant to convey the inability of human intellect to apprehend the sefi rotic emanations. For a similar explanation of the poetic imagery in Ezekiel’s vision, see Gikatilla, R. Joseph Gikatilla’s Commentary, 64: “Know that there are external beasts and they are called ‘holy,’ and they are bound to the throne. And there are inner beasts, which have no measure or aspect in a mind that is created. From the comprehension of the external beasts a man can contemplate a little from within the speculum that does not shine, to comprehend something of an allusion to the interior (remez bi-penimiyyut).” See ibid., 72: “There are supernal beasts in the secret of the great name, blessed be he, in the inner secret, and no mind can enter and comprehend.

The point is made in more direct language in the gloss attributed to Simeon ben Yoai on the middle term in the key expression qol demamah daqah, which is identifi ed both as the qol ha-shofar, the “voice of the ram’s horn” (Exod 19:19, 20:14), and as the gol gadol, the “mighty voice” (Deut 5:19), biblical terms associated symbolically with Binah, the source of divine revelation:“Murmuring”—what is “murmuring” (demamah)? R. Simeon said: A person must be silent with respect to it and to close his mouth (lemishtoqa minneih u-lemesam pumeih), as it says “I resolved I would watch my step lest I offend by my speech; I would keep my mouth muzzled” (Ps 39:2). “Murmuring”—this is the silence that is not heard on the outside (shituqa de-lo ishtema levar).131The implication of the scriptural locution qol demamah daqah, then, is that the divine attribute to which it refers is the silence that is not heard on the outside and, consequently, one must close one’s mouth and remain silent with respect to it. The attentive ear, however, will heed the double silence in the signpost of the murmur, silently speak-ing in speaking silently about the speech of silence that is the silence of speech, the token action that betokens the erotic underpinning of kabbalistic esotericism.Secreted Eros In Eros SecretedAs the voice of silence that is not heard except as the silence of the voice, Binah is troped with a plethora of images that convey her occlu-sion from sight.

As we saw in the case of Abulafi a, so too in the zoharic anthology, a connection is made between gilluy arayot, the uncovering of the genitals, related to illicit sexual relations, and inappropriate disclosure of secrets.133 By contrast, the suitable revelation of secrets, exemplifi ed in the case of Simeon ben Yoai, is correlated with a state of sexual purity. On occasion in the Zohar, this virtue is associated with the murmur, the very gesture deemed as the most pertinent method to divulge mystical wisdom. Consider, for example, the following passage:Therefore, prayer is silent [Éelota ve-laash], like one who speaks secretly with a king [de-mallil be-raza im malka], and as long as he is with him in secret, he is not removed from him at all. . . . Thus, when one juxtaposes [the blessing dealing with] redemption [ gexullah] and the [standing] prayer [tefi llah], one must hold on to him, and to speak to him silently [vi-leishu], in secret [ve-raza], so that he will not be distant from him, and he will not be abandoned us.134The main concern of this text is to secure the conjunction of the people of Israel below to the divine attribute above to which they are attached. Since it is the tendency of all the attributes to extend upward and to be absorbed in the Infi nite,135 how can the bond be preserved? The response relates to the liturgical saying of the Amidah, the standing prayer, also known as the Shemoneh Esreh, the eighteen benedictions, which, according to rabbinic practice, is to be recited silently. Secrecy maintains the union, and thus by uttering this prayer in a whisper the Jewish people guarantee that they will be united to God.The erotic aspect of the murmur is implied in the rabbinic notion alluded to above concerning the need not to separate the redemption ( gexullah) and prayer (tefi llah), that is, the blessing that ends with a refer-ence to the redeemer of Israel ( goxel yisraxel ) and the beginning of the Amidah.136 When rendered through the prism of kabbalistic symbolism, the juxtaposition of redemption ( gexullah) and prayer (tefi llah) signifi es the 133 Zohar 3:79a; Liebes, Studies in the Zohar, 25.134 Zohar 2:138b.135 On the ascent to the Infi nite in the zoharic conception of intention, see Tishby, Wisdom, 955.136 Babylonian Talmud, Berakhot 4b, 9b."},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"  murmuring  secrets  101unifi cation of the male and female potencies in the divine.137 Insofar as the time of the utterance of the Amidah by the male Jewish worship-per (that is, in accordance with the medieval kabbalistic assumption regarding halakhic ritual) corresponds to the initiatory moment of copulation between the masculine Tifxeret and the feminine Malkhut through the phallic potency of Yesod—the process reaches its climax at the conclusion of the Amidah—it follows that everything is “in silence.” In the words of one zoharic homily: “That Righteous One [Yesod] is aroused to be united in love, affection, joy, and desire, with the place that is necessary [Malkhut] . . . and then everything is in a murmur (khola vi-leishu), above and below, in the kisses of desire.”138 The silent prayer is located symbolically at the beginning of the union of the male and female potencies, and, therefore, the appropriate liturgical response is reticence, which refl ects, in turn, the quality of modesty that is apposite to one witnessing the erotically charged drama in the divine pleroma.139 Confi rmation of this complex of ideas is found in the following passage:It has been taught: R. Judah said, “When priests below rise and spread out their hands, all of the holy crowns above are aroused, and they are arrayed to be blessed, and they shine from the depth of the well [umqa de-veira], which overfl ows to them from that depth that issues forth con-tinuously, and the blessings that fl ow from the wellsprings to all the worlds do not cease, and they are blessed and irrigated from all of them.” We 137 Zohar 1;132b, 205b; Book of the Pomegranate, 79 (Hebrew section); Sheqel ha-Qodesh, 75; Tishby, Wisdom, 966–967. On the mystery of intercourse or the repair (tiqqun) of male and female as the primary intentionality (kawwanah) assigned to prayer, see ibid., 957–959.138 Zohar 2:128b. According to Zohar 1:209b–210a, the custom to utter the Amidah silently (be-laash) is explained by the symbolic link of this prayer and the Shekhinah, which is identifi ed as the inaudible voice that is dependent on the masculine Tifxeret, the “voice that is heard” (see above, n. 120). This explanation clashes with another view expressed in the Zohar and other kabbalistic treatises according to which the posture of standing is valenced as male and that of sitting as female, which leads to the conclusion that the standing prayer corresponds to the masculine, in contrast to the prayers that are uttered in a sitting posture, which correspond to the feminine, just as the head phylacteries correspond to the masculine and the arm phylacteries to the feminine. See Zohar 1:132b, 205b; 3:120b; Wolfson, Book of the Pomegranate, 79 (Hebrew section).139 See Wolfson, Language, Eros, Being, 133–134. For a later reverberation of the erotic connotation of the whisper according to the zoharic symbolism in the poetic compo-sitions of Isaac Luria, see Liebes, “Hymns for the Sabbath Meals,” 548, where the “pure olive oil” is described as being drawn into the Shekhinah “in silence” (bi-leishin), and 550, where the hope is expressed that “we will be shown his mystery/spoken in a whisper” (we-yawei lan sitreh/de-mitmar bi-leishah)."},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"102 elliot r. wolfsonhave learnt that at that time silence [leishuta] and stillness [shettiquta] are in all of the worlds. [This may be compared] to a king who desires to unite with the matrona, and he desires to enter her in silence [bi-leishu], and all the servants are stirred up at that time and they whisper “Behold, the king has come to be joined to the martona.” Who is the matrona? This is the Community of Israel.”140According to the teaching attributed to R. Judah, the priestly blessing sets into motion the downpour of light from the depth of the well, which, as we have seen, is a technical designation of Binah, onto all of the emanations and thence onto all of the worlds. A gloss on this teaching introduces the element of the whisper: When the blessings overfl ow from Binah to all of reality, there is a hush that permeates everything. The erotic implications of this stillness are brought into sharp relief by the parable according to which the king desires to enter the matrona “in silence.” We may conclude, therefore, that the opening of the womb of Binah is rendered symbolically equivalent to the act of coitus, which is likewise marked by silence, a moment that calls for timidity.141I will end with the discussion of one fi nal zoharic passage that brings into clear focus the nexus of eroticism and esotericism related to the murmuring of secrets. The text builds on the rabbinic custom to utter quietly barukh shem kevod malkhuto le-olam wa{ed, “Blessed be the name of the glory of his kingdom forever,” after proclaiming out loud the confession of God’s oneness, shema yisraxel yhwh elohenu yhwh ead, “Hear, O Israel, the Lord your God, the Lord is one” (Deut 6:4). The zoharic author notes that there is a parallel between these two utterances, each one consisting of six words, and both together constitute the “supernal order of faith” (sidura illaxah di-meheimanuta): the former effects the uni-fi cation of the sefi rot, especially the lower six emanations from Æesed to Yesod, and the latter the unifi cation of Malkhut in the forces beneath her. For our purposes, it is necessary to focus on the latter. In the precise words of the zoharic text: In that moment, the matrona is crowned and adorned, and her servants enter into her with an abundant silence [vi-leishu saggi ], and they say, “Blessed be the name of the glory of his kingdom forever.” This is in silence [vi-leishu], for thus must she be taken into her husband.142140 Zohar 3:146a.141 Compare the description in Zohar 3:209a, of the mother issuing gifts “in silence” and bestowing them upon the crown that sits on the head of the king.142 Zohar 2:133b. Compare Zohar 3:253b (Ra{aya Meheimna)."},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"  murmuring  secrets  103Deviating from the talmudic explanation, the zoharic author under-stands the gesture of the murmur in decidedly erotic terms. The blessing of Malkhut is whispered because the time of its utterance is when she is united with her male consort, a conjunction that occurs in silence. In the continuation of the zoharic passage, however, we learn of another reason for the silence: They bring her into him in silence. Why in silence? So that the foreign one will not mix in with this joy, as it says, “And no outsider can share in his joy” (Prov 14:10). . . . In the time to come, the evil eye will be removed from the world and it will have no rule, then [the word ] “one” [ead ] will be proclaimed [in relation to Malkhut] openly. Presently, since the Other Side cleaves to her, she is not one, and we unify her silently [vi-leishu], in the mystery of alternative letters, and we say “forever” [wa{ed ]. But in the future that is coming, that side will separate from her and it will be removed from the world, and then surely she will be called “one” . . . as it says, “On that day the Lord will be one and his name one” (Zech 14:9), openly and explicitly, not silently and secretly.143In the present state of the world, there is a struggle between the right side of holiness and the left side of unholiness. As long as this Other Side exists, the unifi cation of the feminine must be uttered silently so that the foreign element will not intrude and penetrate into the space of the holy. In the messianic future, however, the demonic force will be obliterated, and thus it will no longer be necessary to unify Malkhut in a muted way. On the contrary, both male and female will be uni-fi ed overtly, a situation that is expressed in the eschatological vision of Zechariah, “On that day the Lord will be one and his name one,” ba-yom ha-hu yihyeh yhwh ead u-shemo ead. The unifi cation of the male and female implied in this verse repre-sents the ideal of the heterosexual coupling. As I have argued elsewhere, the gender construction that overwhelmingly informs the kabbalistic worldview (based on a close reading of the biblical accounts of creation) is such that sexual union results in the restoration of the female to the male,144 a restitution that, in turn, occasions a shift from the heteroerotic to the homoerotic, the latter signifying, at least ideally, the carnality of ascetic renunciation, which is fully instantiated in the messianic redemp-tion.145 I would suggest that this metamorphosis of the erotic is implied 143 Zohar 2:133b–134a; Wolfson, Book of the Pomegranate, 73–75 (Hebrew section); Sheqel ha-Qodesh, 83.

Support for this interpretation may be adduced from the fact that the liturgical formula “Blessed be the name of the glory of his kingdom forever” is proclaimed out loud on the eve of Yom Kippur, the day of fasting that anticipates the eschaton. Precisely when sexual intercourse is prohibited, and the people of Israel stand in the posture of angelic beings, there is no more need to use the form of silent speech in relation to the divine feminine.146 What is enacted on Yom Kippur proleptically portends the future when the bind of secrecy is undone completely, and the secret nature of eros will be exposed fully in the erotic nature of the secret.BibliographyAbrams, Daniel, “The Shekhinah Prays Before the Holy One, blessed be He—A New Source for the Theosophic Orientation of Hasidei Ashkenaz and Their Approach in Transmitting Secrets,” Ta r b iÉ 63, 1994. 509–533 (Hebrew).——, The Book Bahir: An Edition Based on the Earliest Manuscripts.

The problem is enhanced when those who do so use a language that is not their vernacu-lar, and even more so when that language is part of sacred scriptures, which are understood as paradigmatic and as informing or teaching some sublime forms of experience that took place in the glorious past. Caught between the artifi ciality of the language and the authority of the sacred texts, the dimension of personal experience is often attenuated and sometimes even obliterated. Clichés, models, paragons, rituals, and ideals canonized in the ancient past are powerful obstacles to represent-ing present experiences. These observations certainly apply to Jewish mystical literatures, written in their vast majority during the Middle Ages, and later, in Hebrew and Aramaic, under the strong impact of biblical and other Jewish canonical values and writings. Jewish thinkers and mystics used ancient terminology not only to express their own experiences during the Middle Ages, but also to develop complex sys-tems of thought which emerged from the appropriation of signifi cant parts of Greek and Hellenistic philosophy, which were grafted on the canonical Jewish writings. As part of this process, among many other things they developed a variety of views regarding delight.1The ancient Hebrew vocabulary is rich in terms that can be translated as delight or pleasure, such as ta{anug, {oneg, no{am, hanaxah, sha{ashu{a (and in its plural form sha{ashu{im), or nahat ruah. Each of these terms has its own semantic fi eld, but to describe them with suffi cient nuance would go beyond the scope of this chapter. With regard to the following discus-sions, most important is the fi rst of these six terms, which expresses a stronger form of pleasure than the others. In the Song of Songs 7:7, the term xAhavah (love) accompanies ta{anug as a qualifi er: xahavah be-ta{anugim, literally a love [full] of delight. However, the expression here describes not a feeling, but the beloved herself; it has therefore quite a personal 1 For concepts of delight in Jewish philosophy see the important survey by Berezin, “ ‘Felicity’, ‘Delight’, and ‘Virtue.’ ”"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"112 moshe ideldimension and, we may assume, also carries some kind of corporeal implication. This is also the case with the other occurrence of a plural form that becomes more accepted in later layers of Hebrew; it is found in Ecclesiastes 2:8, where it takes the form ta{anugot benei xadam, that is to say, the delights of men and women.Even more important for the subsequent development of Jewish mysticism is the biblical assumption that man can delight in God. In various verses (Isaiah 58:14, Psalms 37:4, Job 22:6 and 27:10), the refl exive form of the verb {ng, tit{aneg refers to a contact with God, which means that someone may, in principle, take delight in God. The implication of this type of relationship is that God is not conceived of as substantially transcendental or unapproachable, even less unknown by man, but that, at least according to these biblical verses, a strong erotic relationship is deemed to be possible. Or, to put the following discussions in a wider perspective: on the one hand, the biblical theol-ogy of the covenant has sometimes been cast in marital imagery, thus creating a sense of intimacy which has some erotic aspects; and, on the other hand, the biblical and rabbinic rituals that were regarded as quintessential for this covenant were understood in rabbinic and later forms of Judaism as some kind of activity that creates intimacy, including an erotic one, between God as the male and the people of Israel—or its counterpart on high, Knesset Israel—as the female.2 The theme of delight, found in other parts of the Bible, has been drawn into this development, thus creating the assumption that the rituals in question have some erotic valences, described by the term delight.In the following, we shall survey a few of the instances in which ta{anug is used by Jewish mystics, but it should be noted that we will skip the most widespread application of the noun and the verb, related in rabbinic literature and in Jewish mysticism to the post-mortem delight of the righteous, or their souls, in Paradise known as beatitude. Thus the following discussions do not deal with post-mortem beatifi c visions, but with experiences that take place while the mystic is alive. Still, those personal eschatological descriptions would deserve separate treatment, since they also had an impact on how mystics understood their experi-ences while alive, that is, as an adumbration of the Paradisiacal states, or an actualization of future experiences by elite fi gures in the present.2 See Idel, “Rabbinism versus Kabbalism,” and Kabbalah and Eros, 22–38."},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":" TA{ANUG: erotic delights from kabbalah to hasidism 113Ta{anug: Mysticism, Ritual, Theurgy, and TheosophyLet me start with a survey of the issue that is central to our discussion below: the nexus between delight and ritual. Such a linkage occurs explicitly in the Bible (Isaiah 58:13), where the Sabbath is called {Oneg (delight), and has been reiterated thousands of times in subsequent Jewish literatures.3 In rabbinic literature, the performance of the com-plex rituals connected to the rest that is required during the Sabbath has been understood as inducing a state of delight without further systemic explanations. Indeed, even a Jewish philosopher who was not much inclined to appreciate the need to gladden the body, such as the early thirteenth century R. David Qimhi, wrote in his commentary on Isaiah that it is a positive commandment to cause delight to the body during the day of Sabbath by pleasant and good food, since by distinguishing it from the other days in a positive manner he will remember the creation, and that God created the world ex nihilo and rested on the seventh day, and because of it he will praise God and exalt him by his mouth and heart, and his soul will delight.4Qimhi sees the Sabbath as the opportunity for progressing from bodily pleasure to spiritual delight; the latter, in its turn, is connected to the pure contemplation of God, detached from the demands of the body, which have already been satisfi ed. Evidently, only the soul of the observer of the Sabbath ritual enjoys the experience—God’s reaction is neither specifi ed nor assumed.In the Kabbalistic literature, however, the delight of the Sabbath was interpreted in terms of the affi nities that were believed to exist between this day and a supernal divine power, referred to in many cases as Sab-bath: with the sefi rah either of Binah, or Yessod, or Malkhut.5 The Sabbath as a supernal power constellates the time of the earthly Sabbath, which is the time of delight in general and, according to a widespread view, also the time of conjugal union.63 On the connections between delight and Sabbath in rabbinic literature and in Kabbalah see the important monographs of Ginsburg, The Sabbath in the Classical Kab-balah, 63–64, 152 note 94, 154 note 103; and Sod ha-Shabbat, 54–55, 167, 179–180; and Tishby, The Wisdom of the Zohar, III, 1215–1238.4 See his commentary on Isaiah 58:13, printed in Miqraxot Gedolot, fol. 83d.5 See the studies mentioned above, note 3.6 Ginsburg, The Sabbath in the Classical Kabbalah, 289–296."},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"114 moshe idelA brief though quite signifi cant mention of delight is found already in the Book of Bahir, one of the earliest and most important documents of theosophical-theurgical Kabbalah, which emerged at the beginning of the thirteenth century. The anonymous Kabbalist writes: “Habakuk said ‘I know that my prayer has being received in a delightful man-ner, and I too have been delighted.’ ”7 This attribution of delight to the prophet has no parallels in the Bible. We may assume that the text means to refer to a double delight: the divine one that emerges in response to the prayer of the Kabbalist, and that of the Kabbalist himself. The fi rst one is a variant of the earlier rabbinic statements according to which God wishes to receive the prayers of righteous and is affected by them.8 The second one is part of a rabbinic view, already described above, which assumes that the ritual of Sabbath generates delight.9 We may surmise therefore that prayer is an action that induces delight within the divine realm: a view that I propose to describe as a theurgical operation and which refl ects a position that can be discerned also elsewhere in the Book of Bahir.10 Thus a ritual event is understood as generating delight both in the divine and in the human realms. This simultaneity is important, since it attributes to the most widespread ritual in rabbinic and Kabbalistic Judaism an overarching status: its performance generates delight on the two different levels of reality, divine and human. Given the centrality of Sefer ha-Bahir in the history of early Kabbalah, we may assume that this short statement left its imprint on many discussions involving delight, even when the title of the book was not explicitly quoted.For how delight is related to another theosophical stand, we may quote an early thirteenth-century Kabbalist, R. Ezra ben Shlomo of Gerona, who resorted several times to the noun ta{anug:“Let him kiss me by the kisses [of his mouth]”:11 Those are the words of the glory12 that desires, as one who wants to ascend, to adhere [in order] to be enlightened by the supernal light, which is not imagined, 7 See Abrams, The Book Bahir, 145 note 48, and for the Kabbalists who used this section see Scholem, Das Buch Bahir, 49. 8 See, e.g., Babylonian Talmud, Sukkah, fol. 60b. On Rabbinic theurgy see, e.g., Lorberbaum, Image of God, 156–169 (Hebrew), and Garb, Manifestations of Power in Jewish Mysticism, 28–46, 91–97 (Hebrew). 9 See above, note 3.10 See Idel, Kabbalah: New Perspectives, 161–162.11 Song of Songs 1:2.12 Namely the sefi rah of Tiferet.

And the kiss is an allegory for the delight of the adherence of the soul to the “source of life”,13 and the “addition of holy spirit” and this is the reason why it is written “by kisses” [mi-neshiqqot], since each and every cause14 receives thought and addition from the sweet light15 and from that pure splendor.16 I understand this passage—and some of its parallels, which are even more strongly infl uenced by Neoplatonism—as describing two moments in the mystical life: one is the conjunction with the source, and the other is its sequel, namely the augmentation of the Holy Spirit as the result of that adherence.17 If a nexus is assumed to exist between the two moments, the question may be asked: whose, exactly, is the delight? If it is the human soul alone who enjoys the experience of delight, it is diffi cult to understand why an additional effl uence of the Holy Spirit is generated. However, if we attribute the delight to the hypostasis, designated as “source of life,” that enjoys the adherence of the soul, then we may regard the increased infl ux as resulting from the excitation of that hypostatic level of divinity by the mystic’s soul. Indeed, as we learn later on the same page, the “addition of the holy spirit” refers to an infl ux pouring down upon the “seventy-two names,”18 and the phrase “the addition of blessing” refers to a process that takes place within the sefi rot.19 In any case, it should be emphasized that an explicit link between adherence of thought and addition of blessing or infl ux is found also in other instances in R. Ezra. This allows us to assume that we are dealing here with a stable connection, not just a casual one.2013 Presumably the fi rst or the second sefi rah.

Ezra, the soul is also delighted, as we can learn from the phrase ta{anug ha-neshamah—the delight of the soul—that occurs a bit further on the same page.21 My assumption is that by ascending on high, the soul enters the theosophical system and undergoes processes similar to those of the divine powers. Thus in this case too delight has a double subject, just as in the Book of Bahir. Indeed, elsewhere in this commentary, the term ta{anug refers, quite plausibly, to the reception of the divine infl ux by the supernal feminine power, the Shekhinah.22 In fact, in R. Ezra’s theosophy, there is a strong parallelism between the last sefi rah and the human soul.23 Let me point out that the nexus between devequt (adherence or union) and delight became quite widespread in Hasidism, to such an extent that it is quite diffi cult to distinguish between the two terms.24In a collection of Kabbalistic traditions written down at the end of the fi fteenth century, perhaps in the Ukraine or in the Byzantine Empire, by a certain R. Moshe of Kiev, we fi nd a clear expression (that may well refl ect an earlier tradition) of connections being drawn between delight, on the one hand, and a theosophical-theurgical stand, on the other:The lower entities leave an imprint on the supernal one25 by their actions, and this is the reason why each man should delight during the elected day because of the delight of the King and the Queen. And whoever adds to this delight, it is [even] better.26The members of the “royal” pair mentioned here are the sefi rot Tiferet and Malkhut, that is to say, the male and the female divine manifestations respectively, and their erotic union is considered to be of paramount importance for the state of harmony in the higher and lower worlds. Their delight depends upon the human performance here below, and hence by adding delight below a person induces an addition of delight on high. Therefore we have here a fi rst explicit testimony for the induc-21 Kitvei ha-Ramban, II, 485.22 Ibid., II, p. 486.23 See R.

However, in this instance, the processes taking place within the divine world as the result of the human delight—what I call theurgy—are not described as having an effect outside this world, namely in the lower realms of reality (which would turn them into an instance of magic).Let me now turn to the eighteenth century, where we fi nd a dramatic increase of interest in the nexus between delight and ritual. For example, R. Nathan-Neta{ of Sieniawa, a mid-eighteenth-century author of a commentary on the prayer-book, entitled {Olat Tamid writes thatSometimes, when a person recites the verses of the Psalms, a voice is stirred up for him, [namely] a voice to him, and it is from his [own] soul, for out of his joy a great voice enters him, to urge the love of lovers. This happens sometimes even when the person does not know the intention27 [and nevertheless] his soul knows and enjoys a spiritual delight. In the Qeriyat Shema{ as well, a person brings upon himself, with each and every [pronounced] letter, light to the soul [and to] the 248 limbs. And it is incumbent [upon the person] to pray with intention [as far as concerns] each and every [pronounced] letter, since [ he] hints to the supernal worlds, by each letter [pronounced] in holiness.28The delight mentioned here is related, as we learn from the second part of the passage, to a dwelling of divine light upon the soul and body of the person who prays. This experience does not depend upon whether the text someone is ritualistically performing is understood, but on the capacity of the sounds of the text to draw down the light within this world, thereby causing human delight.However, the unquestionable peak of interest in the mystical aspects of delight occurred in the second half of the eighteenth century, basi-cally in Hasidic literature. The transition from Kabbalah to the fi rst Hasidic writings marks a further step in the process of the eroticization of Jewish mysticism. As we shall see below, the Hasidic literature resorts to the term ta{anug much more often—possibly as much as ten times more often—than is the case in the much more extensive corpus of Kabbalistic literature. This statistic preponderance is, in my opinion, of the utmost importance in order to appreciate the new strong emphasis on delight in Hasidism, which is less concerned with discussions of the coupling of the divine pair, the sefi rot of Tiferet and Malkhut of 27 Kavvanah namely the meaning of the words.28 R. Nathan-Neta{ of Sieniawa, {Olat Tamid, I, fol. 33b, and see also ibid., fols. 47b–48a."},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"118 moshe idelKabbalah, and much more with the feeling of delight, which is related to the direct contact between the worshipper and God.29There can be no doubt that R. Israel ben Eliezer Ba`al Shem Tov [1699–1760] (known also as the Besht), the founder of eighteenth-cen-tury Hasidism, put more emphasis on the importance of delight as a religious value than any other Jewish mystic before him. More thorough research into his seminal views on the topic is a desideratum, and in the future I hope to dedicate a separate study to them. For example, the affi nity between delight and worship is found already in a statement attributed to him, which describes the Tzaddiq as “one who delights in the worship of God.”30 According to another view of the Besht, the alternation between coming closer to God and retreating from him, ratzo va-shov, is intended to continuously recreate the feeling of delight that is “the quintessence of the worship of God.”31 In the name of the Besht, we learn from a passage in one of R. Jacob Joseph of Polonoy’s books thatthere are ten sefi rot in man, who is called microcosm, since the thought is named xAbbax [Father], and after the Tzimtzum it was called xImmax [ Mother] and so on, down to faith, which is called “two loins of truth”; and delight [ta{anug] in worship of God is called Yessod, Tzaddiq, and sign of the Covenant.32This is a comparison between microcosm and theocosm. However, for our purpose it is important to emphasize the affi nity between ta{anug and the membrum virile. Though it is the worship of God that is explic-itly invoked as generating the delight, its occurrence in the immediate conceptual vicinity of the “sign of Covenant”—a widespread term for circumcision—and the sefi rah of Yessod do not leave any place for ambi-guity about the fact that the two concepts, delight and the phallus, are directly related (we will discuss this topic in more detail in section 5).The Great Maggid of Medziretch, one of the main disciples of the Besht, asserts that 29 Idel, Hasidism, 120–121, 136–137, 140 142–143, 153, 234–235, 262, 328, 370; Etkes, Ba{ al Hashem, 140 (Hebrew); Mark, Mysticism and Madness, 144–147, 285–286 (Hebrew); and Margolin, The Human Temple, 121, 187, 218–220, 352–353, 358, 360, 370.30 R.

Abraham Friedmann (also called the Angel), men-tions two forms of worship: that of the righteous persons [the Tzad-diqim] who perform the commandments in order to induce delight into God, and another—described as higher, and performed by the greater Tzaddiq—that intends to bring grace to the entire world.38 According to this master, it is by means of his very annihilation that the Tzaddiq draws the divine revelation down into the world here below.39 Thus the theurgy of delight is understood as inferior to the process—to which I would refer as magic, as indicated above—of the drawing down of the divine infl ux.40 The specifi c sequence between the two stages may be signifi cant: the delight, or erotic excitement, which the worshiper induces in God, creates the infl ux, which can be imagined as an emis-sion that enters the world. Indeed, according to a viewpoint that we fi nd in the Hasidic masters, the world in its entirety is conceived of as a female in comparison to God, imagined as a male.4133 xOr ha-xEmmet, fol. 51b.34 See e.g., Midrash Zutta on Shir ha-Shirim, ch.

Levi Isaac of Berditchev:Sometimes the letters rule over man, and sometimes man rules over the letters. This means that when man pronounces speeches with power and devotion, the speeches then rule over him, because the [divine] light within the letters confers to him vitality and delight so that he may address speeches to the Creator; but this man cannot abolish anything bad by performing other combinations [of letters]. But when someone pronounces speeches with devotion and brings all his power within the letters and cleaves to the light of the Infi nite, Blessed be He, that dwells within the letters, this person is higher than the letters and he combines letters as he likes . . . and he will be capable of drawing down the infl ux, the blessing, and the good things.42By investing all one own’s power and devotion in recitation, a person can take over the initiative and rule the letters; by combining them in new ways, he can thus govern the whole of reality.This second aspect of Hasidism I would call “magical”. In contrast, the righteous of a lesser kind (the “theurgical” one, described in the fi rst part of the passage) does not invest “all” his power. Hence he is only given delight, without being capable of transforming reality: the process remains limited to that of his own self-transformation.That religious deeds intend to create delight in God is particularly conspicuous in a book of R. Asher Tzevi of Ostraha, another student of the Great Maggid, who gave a brief and fi ne description:He who directs all his deeds in order to create delight for his Creator, draws down the xAlef, the symbol of the Ruler of the World, in all his deeds. But if he takes the delight for himself [alone], not in order to create a delight in his Creator, he is separating the xAlef, the Ruler of the world.43Therefore the act of drawing down is part of a broader scheme that begins with the induction of delight into the higher world, apparently envisioned as male (as we saw above), but not for the sake of the opera-tor alone.

Israel of Kuznitz’s teacher, that the Tzaddiq induces the emergence of a feminine facet in the divine. R. Levi Isaac adduces, in the name of his master the Great Maggid, the following passage:As is well-known, the word Zoxt45 refers to the feminine facet [of God] . . . [if ] the quintessence of the worship of God is to cause delight to the Creator, blessed be He, then the Creator is referred to as if he is a Recipi-ent, this being the meaning of the verse: “This [zoxt] came from God”46 namely as if the Holy One, Blessed be He, implies the facet of the female, the facet of Zoxt, which is a wondrous thing in our eyes.47The ritual is understood as creating delight for God, perceived now under the aspect of a recipient, that is to say as a feminine entity that is affected by a masculine one: basically a male worshiper. This inver-sion of the traditional roles is reminiscent of the theurgical activity in the mainstream of Kabbalah, where the divine realm is imagined to be deeply affected by human activity.48 A similar idea is found in another important disciple of the Great Maggid, R. Abraham Joshua Heschel of Apta. In his widespread xOhev Israel he distinguishes between two dimensions of the worshipper:44 See, e.g., Idel, Kabbalah: New Perspectives, 65.45 This is the feminine demonstrative pronoun in Hebrew.46 Psalms 118, 23.47 R. Levi Isaac, Qedushat Levi ha-Shalem, 195 and see also ibid., 194 and 353. This tradition was adduced and discussed by R. Moshe Eliaqum Beri{ah, Da{at Moshe, fol. 75a, and see also his relative, R. Elimelekh ben Hayyim of Kuznitz, a descendant of the Kuznitzer Rebbe, in his xImrei xElimelekh, fols. 6d, 136d.

This is especially true in the case of the worshiper of God, who has to possess the aspects of male and female . . . namely that of emanator and recipient. The male aspect means, for example, that which is always emanating: by dint of his holiness and great cleaving, and the purity of his thought, he emanates a spiritual delight into the supernal lights, worlds and attributes. And he has also a female aspect, namely that which is the recipient and draws down to the lower worlds the infl ux from the supernal worlds, and to all [the members of ] the community of Israel whatever they need and all kinds of good graces . . . The male aspect causes an infl ux on high and this infl ux becomes semen and becomes a male aspect with respect to the female . . . and the female aspect of the Tzaddiq is his faculty of receiving the supernal infl ux and of drawing from above to below all kinds of good things and material issues.49The recipient of delight is therefore defi ned, by the very quality of receptivity, as female, independent of any question of gender or sex. This approach, reminiscent of Jung’s views of male and female as two qualities found in both men and women, is here part of the more abstract and ontological category of emanator and recipient, stemming from Neoplatonic sources. Inducing delight defi nes, or redefi nes the hierarchical relationship and the gender of the factors involved in the experience. In the same vein we read in R. Nahman of Bratzlav, one of the prodigies of Hasidic world:It is known that the recipient of delight from someone else is called a female . . . Therefore when the Holy One, blessed be He, receives delight from the prayer of Israel it is as if He becomes a female in relation to Israel . . . since by the smell that God receives from the prayers of Israel He [then] becomes the secret of the female.50Thus, we may conclude that both in theosophical-theurgical Kabbalah and in Hasidism the ritual—consisting basically, although not exclusively, of prayer—is widely understood as having a real impact on the divinity: it induces delight and generates a state in the divine world that may be understood as feminine. Unlike the hypostatic feminine power in the theosophical Kabbalah, which is affected but not generated by human actions, in Hasidic texts it is assumed that the feminine aspect in divin-49 R.

Likewise, the two aspects of the righteous—male and female—do not pertain to sex or gender, or to changes on that level.I refer to this two-tiered relationship between the human elite—the righteous—and the divine as the mystical-magical model that informed many discussions in Kabbalah and Hasidism.52 Among the main inter-pretations of this model is the erotic one that emphasizes the importance of inducing delight as the fi rst stage of this model. While marginal in the general economy of theosophical-theurgical Kabbalah, this erotic interpretation of the mystical-magical model moved to center stage in Hasidic literature.Delight in Ecstatic KabbalahMost of the discussions above assume that it is possible for ritual to have an impact on the complex divine realm, mainly understood as compounded of ten sefi rot. The induction of delight was therefore part of a more elaborate theory concerning the religious task of the Kab-balist, who had to perform the commandments in such a way as to contribute to improving the relations between the divine powers. While the main trend of Kabbalah therefore attributed great importance to the correspondence between human deeds and divine powers, a somewhat later Kabbalistic school, developing in the last quarter of the thirteenth century, focused upon human activity aimed at a direct contact with the divine. One of the signs of this contact was the feeling of delight that the mystic felt during his mystical experience. Many of the expressions of delight found in this current, known as “ecstatic Kabbalah,” owe much to neo-Aristotelean and Neoplatonic philosophical texts, where delight was described as accompanying the supreme human activities, such as the act of intellection and adherence to supernal spheres. This trend draws its inspiration mainly from the kind of perspective 51 See also R. Abraham Yehoshua Heschel, xOhev Israel, fols. 83cd, 85c; R. Jacob Isaac ha-Levi Horowitz, known as the Hozeh of Lublin, Zot Zikkaron, fol. 3b, etc.; and R.

The impassible God of the philosophers intelligizes constantly, but without being himself subject to the feeling of delight. Unlike Mai-monides’ earlier discussions of the delight that is the patrimony of the righteous in their post-mortem existence as part of their intellectual activity, the passage in his Guide of the Perplexed referred to above deals with a near-to-death experience of delight, which may occur in quite exceptional individuals.Much more Plotinian, on the other hand, is the language used to describe a mystical experience in a treatise known in Hebrew as Peraqim be-Hatzlahah and attributed to Maimonides. Written originally in Arabic, presumably in the mid-thirteenth century and with some relation to Sufi sm or to Jewish Sufi circles in the Near East, it evinces some inter-esting parallels to ecstatic Kabbalah. Here the nexus between ritual, ecstasy, and delight is quite explicit:The one who prays shall turn towards God, stand on his feet and feel delight in his heart and his lips, his hands stretched forward, and his organs of speech speak while the other parts [of his body] are all afraid and trembling, while he does not cease uttering sweet sounds; [then] he makes himself broken-hearted, prepares himself, beseeches, bows down and prostrates himself weeping, as if he is before a great and awesome king. And feels a sensation of sinking and trembling until he fi nds himself in the world of intellective beings54Apart from these two examples—Maimonides’ Guide and the Peraqim be-Hatzlahah—the term delight occurs only rarely in philosophical sources until the mid-thirteenth century.55 However, in the ecstatic Kabbalah 53 Maimonides, The Guide of the Perplexed, II, 627–628.54 Peraqim be-Hatzla«ah, 7.

Already in one of his earliest writ-ings, Abulafi a writesAnd I see that up to Him [i.e., God], the quintessence of all experience arrives, as there comes from Him all the wisdom of logic [and] to every intellective soul [comes] the delight of vision.56A fuller discussion of the concept of delight, in an explicitly erotic context, is found in his xOr ha-Sekhel, written in the early eighties of the thirteenth century in Messina:The name [of God, namely the Tetragrammaton] is composed of two parts since there are two parts of love [divided between] two lovers and the [parts of ] love turn into one [entity] when love becomes actuated. The divine intellectual love and the human intellectual love are conjoined, being one. Exactly in the same manner the name [of God] includes [the words] One, because of the connection of the human existence with the divine existence during the [act of ] intellection—which is identical with the intellect in [its] existence—until he and He become one [entity]. This is the [great] power of man: he can link the lower part with the higher one, and the lower [part] will ascend and cleave to the higher, and the higher [part] will descend and will kiss the entity ascending towards it, like a bridegroom actually kisses his bride out of his great and real desire, characteristic of the delight [ta{anug] of both, from the power of the name [of God].57In the context of the present discussion, the salient point is the claim that the two loves are but two parts of a more comprehensive unit refl ected by the structure of the consonants of the Tetragrammaton, which in terms of gematria comprises the value of the Hebrew words xAhavah (= love) and xEhad (= one), both words having the numerical value of 13. Therefore “two loves” and “two times one” are comprised in the numerical value of the consonants of the Tetragrammaton, which is 26. Abulafi a apparently implies that the union between the two types of love, or the two types of existence, is possible because of the fact that they are derived from a basic unity (similar to how Plato in his Symposium envisioned the two halves of the male and the female as having originally been part of one organic unity). Spiritually, the lower human love can meet and be transformed into a more comprehensive 56 Maftea« ha-Re{ayon, fol. 21a.57 xOr ha-Sekhel, fol. 115a, and Idel, Studies in Ecstatic Kabbalah, 66–67, where I sug-gested that this passage is a possible source for Spinoza’s amor dei intellectualis."},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"126 moshe idelentity, which also comprises the higher divine love. We thus witness an interesting case of unio mystica by means of love and intellection. The mystic feels delight; and the question that arises from this passage is whether God, or the cosmic Active Intellect that may play the role of the bridegroom, is delighted too. The end of the passage suggests that the question should be answered in the affi rmative. This also seems to be the case in another passage: in Abulafi a’s commentary on the Guide of the Perplexed, entitled Hayyei ha-Nefesh, where he writes about the cleaving of all [human] knowledge to the Name in its activities, in the secret of the delight of bridegroom and bride. And it is known that this wondrous way is accepted by all the “prophetic” disciples, who write what they write according to the Holy Spirit, and they are those who know the ways of prophecy.58The main gematria—referred as the secret—that informs this passage is ta{anug = 529 = ha-hatan ve-ha-kallah (the groom and the bride), which suggests that delight is not just a pure spiritual or intellectual feeling but has some erotic overtones for both of the entities implied in the process. The same gematria appears also in another passage stemming from Abulafi a’s circle, found at the end of the anonymous Sefer ha-Tzeruf, where the phrase ha-hokhmah ha-xElohit (the science of the Divine) = 529 is adduced in this context, thus concisely expressing the main features of Abulafi a’s view of the subject:59 the study of metaphysics is a delight, and it points to the common delight of the human and the cosmic intellect. In any case, here and in the following passages delight is understood as basically derived from an intellectual act.A leitmotif in these and other passages is that the feeling of delight not only accompanies mystical experiences, but that this pleasure may in fact be the aim of mystical practice. In his Sefer xOr ha-Sekhel, Abulafi a writes: “the letter is like matter, and the vocalization is like spirit, which moves the matter, and the apprehension of the intention of the one moved and of the mover, is like the intellect; and it is that which acts in spirit and matter, while the delight received by the one who appre-hends, constitutes the telos.”60 According to the Aristotelian hierarchy of the four causes customary in the Middle Ages, the ultimate cause, 58 ayyei ha-Nefesh, fol. 65b, and see now ed. Gross, 113.59 Sefer ha-Tzeruf, fol. 35a. The science of the divine is mentioned also immediately before the passage quoted from ayyei ha-Nefesh.

However, elsewhere in his writings the distinction between apprehension and pleasure is not always so sharp, although there too delight is the fi nal telos. In his commentary on the Pentateuch, he writesThe purpose of marriage of man and woman is none other than their union, and the purpose of union is impregnation, and the purpose of impregnation is [bearing] offspring, and the purpose of [offspring] is study [i.e., of Torah by the child born], and the purpose of that [study] is appre-hension [of the Divine], and its purpose is the continuing maintenance of the one who apprehends with delight gained from his apprehension [ta{anug hasagato], and this is the signifi cance of the circle of creation.62We might describe this approach as “intellectual hedonism,” since the telos of the entire creation is the achievement of spiritual delight. In addition to these theoretical expressions dealing with delights of the intellect, there are descriptions of the mystical experience itself and of the sensation of delight accompanying it. According to the quotations just given, it would seem that only the lower intellect enjoys the feeling of delight, because it alone intelligizes the higher intellect. In another instance, we again fi nd an emphasis on the delight of the lower entity. Although it does not use the term ta{anug, the following text represents an interesting parallel to the passage quoted earlier:And you shall feel in yourself an additional spirit arousing you and pass-ing over your entire body and causing you pleasure, and it shall seem to you as if balm has been placed upon you, from your head to your feet, one or more times, and you shall rejoice and enjoy it very much, with gladness and trembling: gladness to your soul and trembling of your body, like one who rides rapidly on a horse, who is happy and joyful, while the horse trembles beneath him.6361 See, e.g., Maimonides, Guide of the Perplexed III:13, “its object or its fi nal end, which is the most important of the four causes.” Further on, in the immediate vicinity of the passage from Sefer xOr ha-Sekhel, Abulafi a writes, “and the purpose is the most elevated of the reasons.”62 Mafteah ha-Tokhahot, fol. 7b (Gross, ed., 12); cf. his Sefer xOr ha-Sekhel, fol. 128a, “and according to the prophet who derives delight in attaining the form of prophecy [i.e., a mystical experience].”63 xOtzar {Eden Ganuz, fols. 163b–164a."},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"128 moshe idelThe comparison of the soul and the body to a horse and its rider is quite a common one in the Middle Ages.64 Abulafi a is ready to con-sider images related to physical pleasure as an appropriate means of expressing feelings that accompany his mystical experience. The ecstatic Kabbalist does not suggest anywhere that this image might be inappropriate to its subject; and on this point Abulafi a in fact departs radically from Maimonides’ teaching. Following Aristotle,65 Maimonides sees the apprehension of the Divine as the highest goal of human activity; the delight which accompanies it is only a side-effect of this activity.66 Abandoning Maimonides’ approach in this respect, Abulafi a crystallized a view—apparently based upon personal experience, and perhaps also infl uenced by Sufi claims—according to which there is an additional stage, higher than the acquisition of intellectual perfec-tion, consisting of delight derived from the mystical experience. In another discussion found in his Hayyei ha-{Olam ha-Bax, the experience of delight accompanies the acceleration of the ritual actions compris-ing the mystical technique articulated by Abulafi a.67 The emphasis on delight in a corporeal context is found in R. Nathan ben Sa{adyah Harar’s Shaxarei Tzedeq, another ecstatic Kabbalistic book written in Messina, where Abulafi a’s disciple writes about the culmination of his mystical exercises: “behold, I was anointed from head to foot as with the anointing oil, and we were surrounded with great joy, and I do not know how to compare to it any image because of its great spirituality and the sweetness of its delight; all this occurred to your servant at the beginning [of the career as Kabbalist].”68 Here we have the very rare case of a fi rst-person confession as to the savorous nature of the mystical experience. A feeling of delight that is much less corporeal than the one depicted in the two preceding passages is found in Abulafi a’s Commentary on the Pentateuch, written in 1289, in the same city:64 See the medieval material gathered by Malter, “Personifi cations of Soul and Body,” 466–467.65 Aristotle, Metaphysics XII, 7, f. 1072b; Ethics, end of ch. 7, 1174a–1176a; Hilkhot Teshuvah 8:2; Haqdamah le-Pereq Heleq (Sefer ha-Maxor, 121–122) as well as Guide III:51. Maimonides took care to emphasize that the pleasure, which accompanies apprehen-sion “does not belong to the genus of bodily pleasures.”66 Compare the Andalusian philosopher ibn Bajjah’s accusation against Sufi s that they are in search of pleasure. Cf. Hawi, Islamic Naturalism and Mysticism, 72–73.67 Hayyei ha-{Olam ha-Bax, fol. 31a.68 See Idel, Natan ben Sa{adyah Harxar, 479.

And the lover and the bride are like the person who desires and the one that is desired and their common denominator is the desire . . . the soul loves the intellect because it is emanating upon it its light, brilliance and splendor, so that it [the soul] is receiving from it a great delight, because it sees by it [by means of the soul] all the existents and that there is nothing among them [i.e. the existences] that is similar, equal, or comparable to it, since all beauty is beneath its beauty, and all degrees are beneath its degree and all delights are beneath its delight. This is why it [the intellect] is to be loved alone, more than any [other] beloved, by the soul, because of itself. Likewise the intellect sees and gazes upon all the creatures but sees none which is more beautiful than it, and worthwhile of a degree and delight [greater] than the perfect soul of man, which knows its degree and beauty and essence, since it [the soul] is the single created form which is connected to this low matter. Those are the paths of love, affection and desire between the intellect and the soul.69Thus the feelings of desire and love are both attributed to the intellect, just as delight was. What is the precise nature of the intellect here is not entirely clear. Is it the individual intellect informing the individual soul? Or the cosmic intellect adorning the individual soul? On the basis of other parallels in Abulafi a, the latter option seems to me more plausible, although the fi rst one is not to be excluded. Thus Abulafi a is much more open than the philosophers to the possibility that the cosmic intellect, or even God as an intellect, also reacts to the human love and aspirations for union, intellectual though this experience may be. Nevertheless, in his writings one would be hard pressed to discern either theurgical or magical aspects connected to the feeling of delight of the cosmic powers.In a rather neglected book entitled {Etz Hayyim written in the fi rst half of the fourteenth century by R. Isaiah ben Joseph, a Byzantine Kabbalist, we encounter a perspective reminiscent of one of the pas-sages adduced above from Sefer xOr ha-Sekhel:Know that the delight of the indwelling of prophecy, which is the infl ux of the Agent Intellect known in Arabic as kif {aqal fa{al is similar to the delight derived from intercourse, with the following difference between them: namely, that when a man completes the evil act of intercourse he despises it, but the infl uence of the intellect is the opposite.7069 Abulafi a, Sefer ha-Maftehot, 6.70 {Etz ayyim, 60."},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"130 moshe idelLike Abulafi a and some Jewish philosophers, R. Isaiah apparently con-ceived of sexual intercourse as an explicitly negative activity—an atti-tude that has few parallels in other forms of Kabbalah. The theosophi-cal-theurgical Kabbalists and the Hasidic authors saw the two forms of delight as part of a continuum, or at least conceived the lower one as positive in principle, although inferior with respect to its counterpart; but in the passage just quoted and in Abulafi a, it is evident that the authors are concerned with emphasizing the huge difference between corporeal and intellectual delight and evaluate the two as completely different.71The above quotations about intellectual delight, together with others I did not cite here, all stem from a broader literary corpus, in fact a school, known as ecstatic Kabbalah. However, there are also instances to be found in other Kabbalistic schools independent of Abulafi a and his students, although presumably drawing from philosophical sources similar to those which nourished the ecstatic Kabbalah. Thus, for example, we fi nd a reference to delight in the context of intellection in a classic of theosophical-theurgical Kabbalah that emerged from the school of Nahmanides’ followers. The anonymous author of Ma{arekhet ha-xElohut explains the signifi cance of “the death by Kiss” in the fol-lowing words:The soul of the righteous one will ascend—while he is yet alive—higher and higher, to the place where the souls of the righteous [enjoy their] delight, which is “the cleaving of the mind.” The body will remain motionless, as it is said:72 “But you that cleave unto the Lord your God are alive every one of you this day.”73This is quite an interesting case of the post-mortem experiences of the righteous souls being applied to a mystical experience in the present. We may therefore assume that in other forms of Kabbalah as well a few parallels exist to the main paradigm of ecstatic Kabbalah.71 See also Abulafi a’s text translated in Idel, The Mystical Experience, 204. Compare, however, the homogenizing approach of Wolfson, Language, Eros, Being, 263.72 Deut. 4:4. Compare also to the interpretation of this verse by R.

One possibility is that they are indebted to the views of the early fi fteenth-century Catalan Jewish philosopher, R. Hasdai Crescas.75 The Hasidic masters, however, emphasized the necessity of renewing the delight related to ritual on a daily basis: they were interested in the ritual dimension of their religious life and not so much in the theological debates between Crescas and Maimonides. On the other hand, Yehudah Liebes has suggested a possible Sabbatean source for these Hasidic discussions.76 For my part, I would emphasize that in both cases, the philosophical and the Sabbatean, ritual was relatively unimportant; and hence I would rather call attention to the possible continuity between theurgical texts such as those discussed above (section 2) and the delight-oriented understanding of worship in Hasidism.Let me begin with a discussion handed down in the name of the Besht by his grandson, R. Moshe Hayyim Ephrayyim of Sudylkov:Just as old age causes weakness in all the limbs of man because the faculties, the humors and the circulation of blood that vivify man, are in decline, so too in the realm of spirituality, an old and aged one [i.e. an old man] does not draw a great delight or vitality, or something new. This is the meaning of the saying77 “Every day they should be as new in your eyes,” because [of the verse]:78 “They are every morning new, [and] great is your faith” which means that because they are new every morning, namely that you innovate every day the work of creation, by the dint of it, “Your faith is great.” We fi nd, therefore, that the quintes-sence of every prayer and commandment is faith.7974 See Margolin, The Human Temple, 218–219; the collection of early Hasidic tradi-tions compiled by Nigal, Leidat ha-Hasidut, 159–164 (Hebrew); and Idel, Kabbalah and Eros, 229.75 For his views see Berezin “ ‘Felicity’, ‘Delight’, and ‘Virtue,’ ” 108, on the depen-dence of delight on the continuous emergence of apprehension.76 See Liebes, On Sabbateaism and its Kabbalah, 192, 394 note 134 (Hebrew).77 Sifrei (Pesiqta’ Zutarti ), Deut 6:6.

Compare also to the important formulation attributed,"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"132 moshe idelIf the attribution of this passage to the Besht is correct—and I see no reason to question it—this means that already at the beginning of Hasid-ism a signifi cant connection is drawn between the importance of fresh-ness, vitality, and delight, and this in the context of a discussion of religious issues like prayer and faith.Continuing a rabbinic and some Cordoverian treatments of the concept of xAin80—nihil—Hasidic masters elaborated on the importance of a theurgy of delight much more than their Kabbalistic predecessors. With the Hasidic masters, self-effacement was conceived of as being part of a continuous process of personal renewal, which could be attained within a larger framework of daily renewal of the creation and of the Torah, as well as continuous renewal within the Deity. This emphasis on the urgency of spiritual renewal also refl ects the more general character of Hasidism as a revivalist movement. Indeed, while this discussion has no explicit connection to the Torah, or to the concept of Torah as a gift, such a nexus is found in a book of one of the early Hasidic masters, R. Menahem Nahum of Chernobyl [1730–1797],81 a younger student of the Besht. Presumably following the latter, the emphasis on the necessity of a continuously-renewed experience of receiving the Torah as a gift is connected elsewhere by R. Menahem Nahum with a particularly erotic understanding of study and theurgy. After adducing the Midrashic view of the Torah as both a bride and a gift, he writes in a remarkable passage reminiscent of the quote from R. Moshe Hayyim Ephrayyim of Sudylkov in the name of the Besht, thatthe union between the bridegroom and the bride, the Assembly of Israel82 and the Holy One, blessed be He, takes place by means of the Torah . . . And just as the bridegroom and the bride will delight in joy, so the Holy One, blessed be He and the Assembly of Israel are [enjoying] correctly in my opinion, by R. Jacob Joseph of Polonoy to the Besht, in Toledot Ya{aqov Yosef, fol. 83c.

He compared us to a bridegroom and a bride, since the permanent delight is not a delight,84 only the union of the bridegroom and the bride, which is a new union, because they did not previously have intercourse. In such a manner someone has to unify the Holy One, blessed be He, with a new union every day, as if on this day it has been given, as the sages, blessed be their memory said: “Let the words of the Torah be new etc.”85 And the reason [for the renewal of the Torah] is that the Holy One, blessed be He, is renewing the creation of the world [Ma{aseh Bereshit] every day, and the Torah is called “creation of the world” because by means of it [namely of the Torah] all the worlds have been created, as is well known. And God is continuously innovating and there is not one [single] day that is similar to the other one, and every day there is a new adherence and coming closer to the Torah, since the day has been created by it in a manner different from “yesterday that passed”.86 This is the reason why Israel is called a virgin [Betullat Yisrael ] . . . because every day its youth is renewed and the union of that day never existed [beforehand] since the creation of the world, and from this point of view it is called a virgin. Whoever is worshiping in such a manner is always called the walker from one degree [of worship] to another, and from one aspect to another, and every day he unifi es a new union . . . and the Torah is called an aspect of the fi ancée [mexorasah] that is an aspect of the bride, so that always a new union will be achieved as [that taking place] at the time of the wedding. This is the meaning of [the story about] Moses that he was studying and forgetting, namely that he was forgetting the delight, because ‘a permanent delight is not delight’, until the Torah had been given to him as a bride to a bridegroom, which means that he received the power to go every day from one degree to another,87 and every new degree and ascent was for him an aspect of the bride, a new union, and this is the great delight like that of the bridegroom and the bride.88Routine and monosemic understandings of the sacred texts, which induce monotony, or inertia, are conceived here, implicitly, as the main danger for fresh religious experiences. The Torah as a gift is understood as possessing the quality of a bride, which means here a virgin whose 83 Isaiah 62:5.84 R. Menahem Nahum, and his son Mordekhai were both very fond of this for-mula. Also R. Aharon ha-Kohen of Apta has attributed to the Besht a passage in which the dictum appears; see his book Ner Mitzvah, fol. 24b, written at the end of the eighteenth century.85 See above, n. 78.86 Psalm 90:4.87 This demand for a continuous renewal is a topos in Hasidism.88 R.

It is therefore incumbent on the student of the Torah to obliterate his earlier knowledge, which may become an obstacle to fresh understand-ings of the Torah. In fact, the study of the Torah is conceived of as novel every day, because God is renewing creation daily by means of the Torah.89 Conceived of as a male, God, according to the above text, needs the theurgical study of the Torah by Jews in order for him to enjoy a new kind of union with His female counterpart, the bride or the Assembly of Israel. Clearly we have here an echo of a strongly erotized covenant-theology. Freshness, both on the cosmic and on the scholastic level, is strongly related to the resulting delight, metaphori-cally connected to an erotic freshness. Thus God cannot renounce the Torah: He needs it in order to recreate the world, and thus also to recreate His own delight on a daily basis. By doing so, He allows for the student to gain a fresh understanding on each and every day of study, as well as creating a new kind of union between the male and female aspects of the divinity induced by this study. The gift of continuously renewed delight is therefore fi rstly a human experience, and next a divine one. It should be mentioned here that the linkage between study of the Torah, on the one hand, and divine delight in this activity, on the other, is a widespread topic, already found in a Jewish text of late antiquity, apparently glossed in Midrash Mishlei chapter X, but belonging to the Heikhalot literature and resonating in Kabbalah long before the emergence of Polish Hasidism.90Let me further address a certain aspect of the long quotation given above, that is, the explicit nature of the reciprocity. The joy is felt as delight not only by the human student, nor only by the divinity as recipient of the theurgical impact. Both enjoy, but the mutuality of their experiences of joy does not obliterate the distinction between them. What takes place is an exchange, rather than a fusion, between the two poles of the erotic event, united though they may be during it.A view similar to the one here discussed in the example of R. Menahem Nahum of Chernobyl is presented concisely in a text by R. Abraham Yehoshu{a Heschel of Apta, a late eighteenth-century Hasidic 89 To a great extent, this view is infl uenced by the Lurianic theory that every day the prayer should be a new one. See R. Hayyim Vital, Peri {Etz Hayyim, 17–18 and Idel, Hasidism, 334 n. 20.90 For references to this text see Idel, Absorbing Perfections, 171–172, 538 n. 32."},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":" TA{ANUG: erotic delights from kabbalah to hasidism 135master who wrote that “routine and inertia obliterate the amusement and the delight,91 since permanent delight is no delight. And in the Holy Torah it is written92 that ‘In each and every day, lets them be as new in your eyes’ ”93 In a manner reminiscent of R. Menahem Nahum of Chernobyl, we fi nd in this passage a close connection between delight and renewal, with both authors quoting the same rabbinic prooftext. However, it seems that these two passages are not directly related but refl ect the impact of an earlier common source, presumably a passage of the Besht. Elsewhere, the same master distinguishes between an infl ux provided by the divine as part of the cosmological process and another type of infl ux which is a free divine gift to man. Moses, who was acquainted with both, preferred the second. However, God, who wanted to enjoy the worship of Israel, preferred to distribute infl ux only as a response to the performance of the commandments and to the study of the Torah by the Jews, because in this way He would receive delight from them.94 This view seems to constitute a rejection of the theory of grace in its Christian forms, that is to say, of grace as freely given without a connection to human activities.Rabbinic tradition saw the gift of the Torah as an entity descending in its entirety. In contrast with this, the passages adduced in this section are premised on the impossibility of transmitting the inner nature of the Torah in its totality: the Torah is seen not as a primordial entity that may move from one place to another, but rather its “true” nature is conceived of as an ever-changing entity. Hence the general concept of “renewal” is more important than that of “stability.” As seen above, the concept of moving from one degree to another is related in this Hasidic context to an understanding of the true nature of the Torah. Vertical ascensional mobility of the mystic from one rank to another becomes in Hasidism an ideal that is combined with the idea of a daily renewed universe, and to that of the intermittent delight of both God and man. It may well be that this emphasis on mystical ascent, which is very representative of Hasidic thought since its beginning, is connected (in this specifi c context) with the ascent of Moses to receive the Torah as described in rabbinic legends, where he was given gifts 91 The Hebrew phrase is Sha{ash{uim ve-ta{anug, 92 See above, n. 78.93 See R. Abraham Yehoshu{a Heschel of Apta, Torat xEmmet, fol. 3c and his younger contemporary, R. Abraham ayyim of Zlotchov, Peri ayyim, fol. 51c.94 See R. Abraham Yehoshu{a Heschel of Apta, Torat xEmmet, fol. 34cd."},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"136 moshe idelother than the tablets. This ongoing ascent should also be understood in relation to another passage by R. Menahem Nahum, where he speaks about another “great gift”, which is the “world-to-come.” The next world consists in a state of “permanent delight,” which is too much to bear if it is experienced all of a sudden; therefore, God created the opportunity of a gradual accommodation towards this state by means of an intermittent experience of delight during the day of Sabbath in this world.95Coming back now to the general concept of “renewal” highlighted above, let me attempt to explain how it is imagined to take place. First and foremost, it is not the very structure of the consonants of the Torah that is renewed. In this respect, R. Menahem Nahum of Chernobyl differs from the perspective found in many other passages in the tex-tual corpus of Kabbalah and Hasidism, which assume the possibility of a change in the order of the consonants of the biblical words.96 Instead, he capitalizes on a concept of transformation derived from an astromagical theory, found already in the Middle Ages and adopted by, among others, R. Moses Cordovero. According to that theory, the written consonants and the sounds are containers or—according to the original terminology—palaces within which the supernal spirituality, the ruhaniyyut, is dwelling or into which it is attracted.97 This spiritual-ity is referred to by numerous other terms as well, such as light (xor), luminosity (behirut), or—most frequently—vitality (hiyyut). These various words all refer to the divine presence within the letters of the Torah: a concept which I propose to call linguistic immanence and which sometimes has explicit erotic aspects.98 According to many Hasidic texts, this spirituality dwells within the letters of the Torah and is part and parcel of its very structure. However, according to numerous other texts, it may be attracted within the consonants by an intense performance of the verbal rituals of prayer or study of the Torah.99 This second, 95 See R. Menahem Nahum, Mexor {Einayyim, 261.96 See Idel, Absorbing Perfections, 377–389.97 On the earlier sources of this term see the seminal studies of Pines, “Shixite Terms and Conceptions,” and “On the Term Ruhaniyyut,” “Le Sefer ha-Tamar.”98 For the erotic aspects of the linguistic immanence see, especially, R. Jacob Joseph of Polonoy, Toledot Ya{aqov Yosef, fol. 151c; and R. Ze{ev Wolf of Zhitomir, xOr ha-Mex ir, fol. 141b.

As already said, this expres-sion is one of the many instances in Hasidism of a transposition of religious values to a supreme level of reality (compare e.g. the reifi cation of human activities in expressions such as “the world of love,” “the world of thought,” or “the world of speech”). Such reifi ed delight was perhaps meant by the Besht to be identical to God. In the same vein, 100 See Idel, Kabbalah and Eros, 168–178.101 For the sources of this concept coined by Aron Gurwitsch, and my use of it in the context of Hasidism, see Idel, Hasidism, 49, 272 n. 15.102 See R. Benjamin of Zalisch, xAhavat Dodim, 85. See also ibid., 211. For the phrase “delight of delights”— ta{anug ha-ta{anugim—as a description of God see, e.g., R. Jacob Joseph of Polonoy, Toledot Ya{aqov Yosef, fol. 102d.

And on the lowest rank in man there is pain, poverty and suffering, and similarly to it in the attribute of Malkhut, which is the last [lowest] attribute “because her feet descend to death.”105 And the [attributes of ] Netzah and Hod in man are standing pillars,106 that man believes the faith in the Creator according to His truth. And the attribute of Yessod is when he delights in the worship of God, blessed be He, more than in any other of all delights, because “out of my fl esh [I shall see God]”107 since the member of copulation is the best of delights because by means of it, male and female are united. And out of the material [delight] he shall understand the spiritual delight, when he adheres to His Unity, Blessed be He, who is the root of all the delights.”108103 This is the book of the thirteenth-century Kabbalist R. Joseph ben Shalom Ashkenazi, attributed mistakenly to the twelfth-century R. Abraham ben David, whose acronym is Rabad. On this important book and its impact on Hasidism see Idel, Hasidism, 12.104 This is a misreading of Sefer Yetzirah 6:1.105 Proverbs 5:5.106 Namely the two pillars of the temple, called in the Bible Yakhin and Bo{az, which were sometimes understood as corresponding to these two sefi rot.107 Job 19:26. On the medieval interpretations of this verse in Jewish thought see Altmann, “The Delphic Maxim.” Though this verse occurs several times in R. Joseph ben Shalom’s book, I wonder whether one may fi nd there a phallic interpretation, which occurs, however, several times in R. Moshe Cordovero’s Pardes Rimmonim. See, e.g., 16:6, continuing, presumably, the position of Zohar, I, fol. 94a and of Tiqqunei Zohar, fols. 41b, 70a. For the strong relation between delight, the phallus, and the move-ments during prayer see the view found in several sources sometimes in the name of the Besht, e.g. Toledot Ya{aqov Yosef, fol. 102d and Liebes, On Sabbateaism and its Kabbalah, 98–99 and 124–125, where the Job verse occurs in quite a sexual though less phallic context, and see also page 130 there. See also note 113 below; and see the Zoharic phrase {innuga de-kulla, the delight of all, found in Zohar II, fol. 259a (and Idel, Kabbalah and Eros, 228–229), which may have a sexual implication.108 R. Jacob Joseph of Polonoy, Toledot Ya{aqov Yosef, fol. 16c. It is hard to decide where the words of the Besht end and when does R. Jacob Joseph of Polonoy intervene. See, however, another passage found in the same book, fol. 138d, where the interpretation of the Job verse in quite a similar way is attributed to the Besht, as well as on fol. 28d, where Joseph is linked to the delight of Yessod, again in a passage that starts with an attribution to the Besht. For the a fortiori view that learns from the material delight about the spiritual one see also, e.g., ibid., fol. 16d. On pain and the Shekhinah see also the discussion of R.

Jacob Joseph of Polonoy. In both cases, the human microcosm and the theocosm are described as corresponding and isomorphic, although in the quote just given the Hasidic master is much more explicit in analyzing the human/divine correspondences. For our purpose here, it suffi ces to point out that the anatomical parallelism between the corporeal delight related to the human penis, and the delight someone takes in the union with God, is explicit and crucial for the entire passage. It is based upon an interesting interpretation of the biblical word basar, the common meaning of which is “fl esh”, that is to say “body”, and which more specifi cally means “phallus” (as understood in various instances in the Bible, as well as in Kabbalistic literature, and certainly in the present text).109 However, the point is not so much that the specifi cs of the anatomic structure of the phallus are pertinent to the claim made by the Hasidic master (if indeed they are relevant here at all), although such may be the case in some other Kabbalistic sources.110 Rather, what characterizes the Hasidic imagery here is the double function of the phallus as uniting two entities and inducing feelings of delight. This is only one among many examples of the appropriation of theosophical symbolism—here the sefi rah of Yessod as delight—in a manner that shifts the emphasis from the theosophical meaning to a more anthropocen-tric one. Of great importance for our point that the Besht is the main source of views about delight found in the writings of his disciples is a lengthy passage found in another book of R. Jacob Joseph of Polonoy, where even a sinner’s delight is understood as being connected to the supernal delight.111109 See the way in which the term basar is used in Genesis 17:11, Ezekiel 16:26 and 23:20. See also the Beshtian texts adduced by R. Aharon ha-Kohen of Apta, Keter Shem To v I, fol. 3ab. This understanding of basar in the verse of Job is found also in a text of R. Tzevi Hirsch of Galina. See above note 109 and below note 124.110 See, e.g., Wolfson, Circle in the Square. Let me point out that though in some cases a strongly phallic understanding of some Kabbalistic texts as proposed by Wolfson is appropriate, his moving of this topic to the center of Kabbalah as a whole seems to me unwarranted in most of the Kabbalistic schools, including some of the texts he adduces in order to demonstrate his point. I cannot deal here with this interesting scholarly problem, and I hope to do so in a more detailed manner elsewhere. 111 See Kutonet Passim, 240 and the analysis of Piekarz, The Beginning of Hasidism, 238–240 (Hebrew). See also Margolin, The Human Temple, 227–228. Whether this Hasidic approach has something to do with Sabbateanism is a question that cannot be addressed here. See above n. 109."},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"140 moshe idelHowever, more Platonically-oriented formulations occur in texts that are relatively early in Hasidism and that may, again, refl ect the Besht’s view. For example, his grandson writes as follows about the patriarch Joseph remaining faithful to the imperative of knowing God in all his ways:For example, when a certain delight [stemming] from a [certain] thing reached him, he should put his attention to the [primary] source and root of all the delights, wherefrom all the delights emerge, namely from the Cause of All Causes that vivifi es all and gives vitality to all things, and it is from there that delight reaches him. And when he will direct his attention to it and will believe in it in a total manner then all the mate-rial delights are obliterated and this is the reason that it is hinted in [the verse] “And God was with Joseph,”112 namely that he was always seeing the Tetragrammaton before his eyes,113 and he united himself to the inner aspects of all things, and to the root of all roots . . . and he penetrated all things and delights and he found the root and interiority that vitalizes everything, and wherefrom all delights are generated.114The reference to the fi gure of the biblical Joseph is vital for understand-ing some of the resonances of this passage. This patriarch is known in Jewish tradition, and especially in the theosophical-theurgical Kabbalah, as the paragon of sexual chastity whose refusal of engaging in sexual relations with Potiphar’s wife became exemplary.115 According to this passage, he preferred the contemplation of God as divine name over the coarse experience of sexual delight. The contemplation of the divine must therefore be seen as a method of fi ghting against corporeal desire or withstanding a sexual ordeal. A similar position is found in another early Hasidic book authored by R. Menahem Nahum of Chernobyl:The entire quintessence of our worship is to purify the attributes that are within us and elevate them by the fact that by means of them, he worships God, Blessed be He. All this is done when a bad love or bad awe—God forbids—comes, and because of his good contemplation he contemplates, he will tremble and say in his heart: this is but a love fallen from the world of love, the love of the Creator, blessed be He, and it is incumbent on me to elevate it, and how shall I do this bad thing to 112 Genesis 39:21.113 Cf. Psalm 16:8. The practice of contemplating the letters of the Tetragrammaton precedes Hasidism but has been widespread in this type of Jewish mysticism. See, espe-cially, R. Asher Tzevi of Ostraha, Ma{ayan Hokhmah, fol. 73b, where the contemplation of the Tetragrammaton serves as an exercise to temper the corporeal delight.114 Degel Mahaneh xEfrayyim, 51.115 Scholem, On the Mystical Shape of the Godhead, 91; Wolfson, Circle in the Square, 145–146; and Idel, BEN, 445."},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":" TA{ANUG: erotic delights from kabbalah to hasidism 141lower it even more. And I love this bad thing that is a thing created by the Blessed One, and by Torah, by means of which all the creatures have been created, and He is the delight of all the delights, and this is the case of all the other attributes [ways of behavior]. In the moment that one of the attributes arouses [i.e., emerges within him], then he should be in awe and fear, and tremble [not] to use the scepter of king of the world116 in order to provoke Him and act against His will and rebel in front of His eyes. On the contrary, when that attribute arouses [i.e., emerges], and an opening of that attribute opens, then he should elevate the fallen things to their root [by his contemplation], since God, Blessed be He, has no greater delight than this great delight.117According to this passage, the temptation of engaging in a sexual encounter that is considered illicit or inferior is not just an ordeal but also an opportunity for retrieving the supernal source of delight by elevating the lower to its higher source. Such an elevation combines the Neoplatonic concept of the return to the source (reversion) with a more activist approach that considers it an imperative to purify activities of a lower kind, so that they can be restituted to their source in the divine world. A similar approach is found also in the Great Maggid’s treatment of Joseph.118In the three Hasidic approaches to the possibly sinful relationship as described above, we are not dealing with a simple case of avoiding or escaping such a relation, but mainly with a project of refi ning the coarse shell that contains within it the divine spark conducive to the source of all delights. Delight is not rejected per se, but only in what the Hasidic masters conceived of as its fallen or inferior manifestation. The latter is still envisioned as capable of becoming, ideally, an oppor-tunity for obtaining an even higher delight related to God, depicted as the supreme source of all delights. Only oblivion as to the substantial affi nity between the lower and the higher delight may render the feeling of delight here below sinful.What, then, about the attitude towards corporeal delight in Hasidism against the background of the Platonically-oriented discussions adduced above? Does corporeal delight enjoy some signifi cant status in Hasidism, 116 This is a rabbinic phrase, dealing with the prerogatives of the human king, which has been interpreted by the late thirteenth-century Kabbalist R. Joseph of Hamadan and under his infl uence by many others, as referring to the divine phallus.117 R. Menahem Nahum of Chernobyl, Mexor {Einayyim, 26.

Are corporeal delight and attachment to the divine as a delightful experience considered incompatible? Or are there merely tensions between them, or indeed are they part of a continuum? These questions are hard to answer, and not in the least place because there is no reason to assume that all Hasidic masters would have agreed in this matter. Here as in many other cases, variety and controversy is integral to Jewish discourse; and indeed, one of the most important scholarly disputes about the nature of Hasidism—that between Gershom Scholem and his students, on the one hand, and Martin Buber, on the other—is grounded in very different ways of understanding the attitudes to the world found in Hasidic literature.119 In what follows, I will attempt to address one of the more explicit Hasidic approaches towards sexuality with which I am acquainted. As will be seen, I see it as reinforcing Buber’s assumption that Hasidism had a much more positive attitude towards the material world than his opponents assumed.Let me fi rst turn to a passage by R. Zexev Wolf of Zhitomir, another disciple of the Great Maggid of Medziretch. Commenting on the bibli-cal recommendation to leave one’s parents and adhere to one’s wife, the Hasidic author asks:Prima facie this is astonishing. Does the Torah recommend literally that someone will adhere to his wife and fulfi ll the passions of his heart? However, this should be interpreted as an advice given to man by the Torah about how to cleave to the Holy One, Blessed be He, and he should learn from the adherence to his material wife. If he sees that from such a delight he has an adherence and a pleasure that is transient and that dissipates after a short while, a fortiori he will have an adherence and a delight from the Creator, blessed be He, and he will feel the delight of all delights that is eternal, one that gives him life in the world to come. And this principle is that the aspects of the details of the delights that have descended in this material world, all descend from the Torah. The letters of the Torah are clothed in every thing that is created . . . and someone 119 Buber, “Interpreting Hasidism”; Scholem, “Martin Buber’s Interpretation of Hasidism.” This is the expanded version of the article originally printed in Commentary 32 (1961), 305–316. On the controversy see Margolin, The Human Temple, 6–51; Schatz-Uffenheimer, “Man’s Relationship to God and World,” and her introduction to her Hasidism as Mysticism, 10–18 (Hebrew); and the studies of Oppenheim, “The Meaning of Hasidut”; Kepnes, “A Hermeneutic Approach”; the introduction of Dresner to Heschel, The Circle of the Ba{al Shem Tov. Buber’s view of Hasidism, and the criticism by Scholem, has been extensively discussed in Schaeder, The Hebrew Humanism of Martin Buber, 287–338.

Material delight is not considered in this passage as a feeling that is antagonistic to the attainment of the supernal one—in contrast, I repeat, to some other Hasidic discussions.121 On the contrary, a man can extrapolate from the temporary pleasure he enjoys in the sexual relations with his wife, to the even more sublime feeling that he may experience eternally from his adherence to God. The lower delight is not necessarily opposed to the higher experience but constitutes a presence of the spiritual within matter; and hence it is possible to adumbrate the experience of the latter by enjoying the former. It should be pointed out that in the above passages, the affi n-ity between delight and adherence—devequt—may imply that there is an erotic overtone to cleaving to God as well. In a way, the Plotinian theory according to which the individual soul is not separated from the cosmic one, adopted widely by Hasidic masters, assumes a continuum between the spiritual and the material world and hence the possibility of reaching the former starting from the latter.122Moreover, delight is connected in many Hasidic texts with the study of the Torah and even with prayer, since the divinity is present in the entire realm of reality by means of the letters that were part of the creative process. Thus, while in many cases delight may be under-stood as resulting from the erotic contact between the worshipper and the transcendent divinity, in some other cases, as in the passage of 120 R. Zexev Wolf of Zhitomir, xOr ha-Mexir, fol. 2c. See also ibid., fol. 26b, in a parable explicitly attributed to the Besht. Compare also to the view of the early eighteenth-century Hasidic author R. Menahem Mendel of Rimanov, adduced by his student R. Ezekiel Panet, Mena«em Tzion, 44, who distinguishes also between the transient and the eternal nature of the two kinds of delight.121 See, e.g., R. Barukh of Kosov, {Amud ha-{Avodah, fols. 98a, 99a, and 204d, where the assumption is that the spiritual delight obliterates the material one. Another approach, found several times in Hasidic literature, especially in R. Asher Tzevi of Ostraha’s Ma{ayan okhmah, assumes that the supernal delight is found within the lower one as holy sparks within shells, and the former should be freed of their bondage by elevating them, and thus abolishing the shells. This is an interpretation more consonant with Scholem’s view.122 See Idel, Enchanted Chains, 43–44, 51–52."},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"144 moshe idelR. Ze{ev Wolf, this contact is mediated by the act of fathoming linguistic elements found in all the realms of existence. Thus the higher delight does not necessarily require an escapist attitude: it is also possible to penetrate the superfi cial aspect of reality in order to enjoy a delightful experience here below, that actually represents a higher reality.123 In other words, what we have here is an instance of the eroticization of the entire realm of reality, by means of letters that are imagined to have been instrumental in the creation and the sustaining of reality.From this point of view we may speak of an inclusive type of Hasidic attitude as compared to the much more exclusive approaches of Hasidei Ashkenaz and Abraham Abulafi a. The ecstatic Kabbalist dissociates material from spiritual delight, which is not the case in Hasidism. Although Abulafi a was not inclined to asceticism, he nevertheless did not see the very performance of a sexual act as a means to intuit the supernal delight.124 In the case of Hasidei Ashkenaz, the relation between corporeal and spiritual delight is less exclusive, but still the two are not parts of a continuum. In the famous early thirteenth-century Sefer Hasidim, the major book of Hasidei Ashkenaz, we read:And that joy [out of love of God] is strong and overwhelms his heart so much, that even a young man who has not gone to a woman for many days, and has great desire, when his seed shoots like an arrow and he has pleasure, this is as naught compared with the strengthening of the power of the joy of the love of God.125While not critical of corporeal delight, the Ashkenazi author does not create a signifi cant nexus between that feeling and the delight someone feels when he loves God.It should be pointed out that the elevation of corporeal delight is part of a much more general attitude in Hasidism, which also includes 123 See the very interesting passages from the mid eighteenth-century author R. Tzevi Hirsch of Galina, adduced by Piekarz, Between Ideology and Reality, 239–245 (Hebrew), where the need to enjoy material delight in order to reach the spiritual is evident. See also the important discussion of R. Aharon Kohen of Apta, xOr ha-Ganuz la-Tzaddiqim, col. 4, fol. 3ab. See also the later R. Moshe Elyaqim Beri{ah of Kuznitz, Bexer Moshe, 185, where he connected the theory of elevation of the lower entities and of delight with that of an immanent presence of the divine everywhere in the world.124 See Idel, The Mystical Experience, 204–205.125 Sefer asidim, par. 300, 240. In R. Eleazar of Worms’ Sefer ha-Malakim, and under its infl uence in Sefer Raziel ha-Malakh, it is written: “And at the time that a young man engages in intercourse and shoots like an arrow [i.e., ejaculates], that selfsame pleasure is as nought compared with the slightest pleasure of the World to Come.” These three sources have already been adduced together in Guedemann, Ha-Torah weha-Hayyim bi-ymei ha-Benayim, I, 124, n. 2."},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":" TA{ANUG: erotic delights from kabbalah to hasidism 145the elevation of mundane forms of beauty to their source, so that the beauty of a nice woman should be understood as refl ecting in this world the splendor of the divine presence. The contemplative eleva-tion of beauty to its source is described as causing delight to God—an approach that can be described as theurgy.126Concluding RemarksOne may speak of a continuous ascent in the course of the centuries of the importance of ta{anug in the general economy of Jewish mysticism. On the one hand, this development has to do with a general tendency in Jewish mystical literatures of attributing ever greater importance to feelings in general and to erotic imagery in particular; and on the other hand, it has to do with a process of mitigation of the hypostatic thinking that was originally dominant in the main schools of Kabbalah. This mitigation of hypostatic thought is one of the main reasons why delight is so important precisely in ecstatic Kabbalah and in Hasidism, two major schools which were less interested in theosophical structures and much more concerned with experiences.127 On the other hand, the ascent of delight in Hasidism is concomitant to the decline—although not the total disappearance—of asceticism in this movement, an impor-tant development that has been widely recognized by scholars.It is in Polish Hasidism, a conglomerate of several mystical approaches, that the variety of earlier themes related to delight was adopted, adapted, and combined in different ways. The most common denomi-nator in those discussions is that delight occurs in the context either of performing a ritual,128 or of resorting to a technique in ecstatic Kabbalah—that is to say, it typically accompanies certain types of 126 See the important discussion by R. Zexev Wolf of Zhitomir, xOr ha-Mexir, fol. 16cd. More on this issue in the context of a more detailed analysis of R. Zexev Wolf ’s passage, in Idel, “Feminine Beauty.”127 To a certain extent, the main parallel to ta{anug generated by the worshipper as a factor that induces the divine erotic or sexual response is the Kabbalistic expression mayiin nuqbbin—the female waters—which is the trigger for the arousal of the desire in the supernal male. However, this is again a more organic or physiological component, in comparison to the more emotional one, the delight. On the psychological readings of the sefi rotic ontology of theosophical Kabbalah, which is evident already in the thirteenth-century ecstatic Kabbalah and its early Hasidic manifestations see Idel, Kabbalah: New Perspectives, 146–153; Hasidism, 227–238.128 See, e.g., the phrase ta{anug mitzvah, the delight of performing a commandment, in Toledot Ya{aqov Yosef, fols. 90b, credited to the Besht, and compare to fol. 55a."},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"146 moshe idelreligious action. Delight must therefore be seen in the context of reli-gious performance, and as parallel to the idea of adding powers on high (according to the more widespread theurgical interpretation of the ritual) or of drawing supernal blessing or vitality downward (according to the magical one). Furthermore, from a phenomenological point of view, it is quite fascinating to observe in this context descriptions of the divinity as experiencing delight and subsequently, in some cases, as explicitly feminine. Thus an important aspect of the meaningful rela-tionship between the worshipper and God is conceived of as that of transforming one of its aspects into a feminine entity. It is only rarely that an explicit worship of the distinct feminine power, as found in Kabbalah, makes its appearance in Hasidism.129 It should be pointed out that we may also encounter a few Hasidic descriptions of worship by means of the intellect that induces delight into divinity. These might be seen as instances of a synthesis between the intellectual aspect of the ecstatic Kabbalah and the theosophical-theurgical one.130In other words, we are dealing with two major and intertwined developments in Jewish mysticism. One of them has been surveyed above, that is, the eroticization of ritual. The other one began already in rabbinic literature but became much more prominent in the main trends of Kabbalah and entails a ritualization of eros and sex.131 The theosophical-theurgical Kabbalah emphasized the complex structure of divinity consisting of various types of hypostases, and subsequently the sexual affi nities between two or more of them attracted attention; from this emerged the core formula according to which the rites intend to unify a divine power, understood as male, and the Shekhinah, the divine presence, understood as female.132 Hasidism, however, while continuing this approach, shifted the focus of attention from the sexual anatomy of the divine powers and the attempt to infl uence them by means of rituals to emotional interactions between the worshipper and God.Within this more general framework, there are two main ways of understanding human religious action: the Platonic ascent that brings the lower delight to its higher source, and the theurgical ascent 129 See, ibid., fols. 138d and 152b.130 See, e.g., the Great Maggid, Maggid Devarav le-Ya{aqov, 266, where the “world of delight” is described as apprehension, and the description found in R. Aharon ha-Kohen of Apta, xOr ha-Ganuz la-Tzaddiqim, col. 2 fol. 3a. For another affi nity between this book of R. Aharon and ecstatic Kabbalah see Idel, Hasidism, 59–60.131 See Idel, Kabbalah and Eros, 143–144, 234–235, 240–241, 247–250.132 See ibid., 1–3, 233–236."},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":" TA{ANUG: erotic delights from kabbalah to hasidism 147that causes delight within the divine sphere. Different though these approaches are, they have sometimes been combined in Hasidism. In any case, the increasing importance of delight since the Middle Ages, and its peak in Hasidism, can be better understood against what I consider to be the background of this development, that is, the rab-binic and Kabbalistic forms of Judaism as cultures of eros.133 Thus the Hasidic emphasis on delight as resulting from some kind of erotic relationship between man and God, or man and the Shekhinah, is part of a much earlier move, one that took up certain approaches which were originally of secondary importance and moved them to the center. Still, unlike Abulafi a’s intellectual hedonism (mentioned above), theosophical Kabbalah and Hasidism did not indulge in what may be called carnal hedonism, positive though their attitude toward corporeal delight may sometimes have been.134On a more methodological note, the above discussions assume that Hasidism should be understood against the background of many dif-ferent developments in medieval and premodern Judaism, the various Kabbalistic and Kabbalistic-ethical literatures being major but not exclusive sources for Hasidic mysticism. A panoramic approach, which in our case perhaps includes Crescas’s philosophy too, is a much better way of understanding the various and sometimes confl icting develop-ments in Hasidic thought than seeing it only through the perspective of its relationship to Sabbateanism.135 However, broad though the range of sources nourishing Hasidism may have been, the role played by the Besht in shaping the thought of his followers, at least as concerns the case of delight, was paramount.136 Still, his new strong emphasis on delight did not refl ect only the patrimony of Hasidic masters in the limited sense of this term; as Jonathan Garb has recently shown, signifi cant reverberations of the theurgy of delight may be discerned even in Jewish religious thought in the twentieth century.137133 See ibid., 22–38, 238–246.134 It should be pointed out that a rejection of ancient Greek carnal hedonism, by resorting to this very Greek term transliterated in Hebrew, and of Kant’s moral hedonism, is found in an early twentieth-century Hasidic author, R. Menahem Nahum Friedmann of Stefanesti-Itzkani towns in the province of Bukovina), in his commentary on the Rabbinic “Treatise of the Fathers,” entitled Perush ha-Man, 319–320.135 For a panoramic approach to Hasidism see Idel, Hasidism, 9–15.136 For my general opinion as to the dominant role played by the Besht in signifi -cantly shaping Hasidic thought in the fi rst generation of his disciples, see Idel, “The Besht as a Prophet and a Talismanic Magician.”137 See Garb, “The Chosen will Become Herds,” 101, 203–204."},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"148 moshe idelThe new emphasis on delight I surveyed above was also part of what I call the search for plenitude of experience in mysticism.

There are specifi c adumbrations of this tradition in which the virgin Mary is read into the story as the desiring bride. The liturgies for the Marian feast days drew upon the Song (as well as on other passages from the biblical Wisdom literature), and these Marian liturgies in turn neces-sitated and infl uenced subsequent commentaries in which Mary is read as the beloved of Christ, often in place of, or alongside, readings which interpreted the feminine beloved as Ecclesia.1 In the medieval liturgical and commentary traditions, the divine eros is essentially polymorphous; heavenly love does not heed the earthly conventions governing erotic contact between genders and family members, and Christ and Mary may be found represented in various confi gurations of erotic relation to one another.Beyond the intradivine erotic processes fi gured in liturgical and exegetical works, it is well known that the Song has deeply informed 1 A list of the major early commentaries (to 1200) is given at the end of Ann Matter’s study, The Voice of My Beloved.

The most infl uential Marian commentaries on the Song include those of Honorius Augustodunensis and Rupert of Deutz. Honorius wrote two commentaries; one, known as the Sigillum Beate Marie [PL 172:495–518] (circa 1103), and a later more elaborate work, the Expositio in Cantica Canticorum [PL 172:347–496], some time after 1132.

The Song also clearly infl uenced more theoretical and prescriptive works giving instruction on the leading of a holy life (including works for women, like the Ancrene Wisse, or Guide for Anchoresses).2The fact that people dedicated to lives of asceticism and celibacy so often describe—or are instructed to imagine—their relation to the divine through the modality of an experience of erotic passion is a paradox which fi nds itself directly addressed at some point in most modern secondary works on the experiential and exegetical uses of the Song. In Denys Turner’s delicate analysis of the Song commentaries, Eros and Allegory, he reiterates the question: why eros? Why does eros underlie a conception of God’s relation to the humanum and vice versa, consider-ing that it does so in commentaries on the Song written in a monastic culture where celibacy is upheld as an ascetic virtue? He directs us into the commentaries by the avenue of the pseudo-Dionysius: God “is, as it were, beguiled by goodness, by love (agape) and by yearning (eros) and is enticed away from his transcendent dwelling place and comes to abide in all things.”3 Turner constructs his own theological elaboration of Dionysius’ words:the divine eros is a love which creates that other which it loves, for it creates out of goodness, not because of any supererogatory goodness it can thereby secure. It is out of that “necessity” which is love that God creates; but creation is for that same reason an absolutely free act and we should be entirely lost for the words in which to construe this paradox if we had not the language of eros in which to utter it.42 Secondary works on these authors and their relation to the Song are numerous; the mystical tradition has generally been studied more (and its authors have been more frequently edited and translated) than the commentary tradition. English versions of the important mystical texts are available in the “Classics of Western Spirituality” series. Beguines and Victorines are discussed in Bernard McGinn, The Flowering of Mysticism, and more briefl y in his pithy essay “The Language of Love in Christian and Jewish Mysticism.” For Rolle’s use of the Song see especially Denis Renevey, Language, Self and Love. Discussion of the Song particularly as it infl uenced Middle English writings (including both Rolle and the Ancrene Wisse) may be found in Astell’s Song of Songs in the Middle Ages.3 From Divine Names, 712 B, quoted in Turner, Eros and Allegory, 47–48; also 67.4 Turner, Eros and Allegory, 67."},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":" complications of eros 155We need eros, then, in Turner’s theology, to avoid being lost for words. To turn this idea around a little bit, it might be said that the paradox of eros (as a type of human experience) mirrors the experience of the paradoxes involved in conceptualizing divinity, for even before it is used as a manner of conceptualizing God’s action, eros already joins the sublime to the ridiculous experientially. Human love itself may baffl e the intellect and thus allow the desiring subject a glimpse of some-thing apophatic. The commonality of this aspect of the experience of human desire is precisely what makes eros useful as an axis of study, whether or not one sympathizes with the co-option of erotic language as a frame for divine experience. As Bernard McGinn puts it, “erotic language forms a test case for studying the complex relations between common human experience—that is, sexual desire and consummation as mediated through language—and forms of human consciousness (also mediated through language) that claim more.”5In this chapter, I would like to take another look at eros as a “test case” for the articulation of types of human experience as they are mapped onto ideas of divinity. However I will be focusing on the uses of exegesis of the Song in a text less well known, and less often stud-ied, than any of those I have so far mentioned: the Liber fl orum celestis doctrine, a fourteenth-century ritual text composed by John, a monk of the Benedictine abbey of Morigny.6 The book combines visionary autobiography, fi gures, and prayers compiled from a complex set of liturgical sources and dependent as well on the Ars notoria of Solomon,7 another 5 McGinn, “Language of Love,” 226.6 Discoveries of different manuscripts of this text were made independently in the 1990’s by Sylvie Barnay in France and Claire Fanger and Nicholas Watson in Canada.

In the Liber fl orum, words from the Song of Songs and its commentaries fi gure in diverse locations both in the prayers and the autobiographi-cal sections of the book. John’s uses of the Song are reminiscent of both affective and prescriptive traditions of mystical writing, inasmuch as John is endeavoring not only to describe experiences of divine illumination that he himself has had, but also to create such experi-ences for subsequent operators. As will be seen, his understanding of the Song remains in all essential ways under the infl uence of the commentary tradition; however, John’s eros is principally constituted epistemologically. John differs from many of the late medieval mysti-cal writers in that his stated goal is not apophatic illumination, but the liberal arts and other evidently more secular forms of knowledge.Some Maps of the Relation between Love and KnowledgeBernard McGinn articulates a new apprehension of the roles of love and knowledge coming about in mystical writings after the twelfth century, one that depends on Thomas Gallus’ reading of the Pseudo-Dionysius onto the Song of Songs:8At the risk of oversimplifi cation, we can say that two broad streams of the interpretation of Dionysius can be found in the later Middle Ages: the speculative Dionysianism initiated by the Dominican master Albert the Great, and what is often referred to as the “affective Dionysianism” fi rst given systematic formulation in the writings of Thomas Gallus.9In general, McGinn goes on to say that the fi rst stream10 is character-ized by that fact that, while love may be valorized as a higher form of résurgence de la théurgie antique?” Comprehensive information about the background of history and transmission of the Ars notoria, as well as editions of the main textual traditions, are to be found in the dissertation by Julien Véronèse, “L’Ars notoria au Moyen Âge et à l’époque moderne.” 8 In line with Paul Rorem and others; McGinn cites Paul Rorem, Pseudo Dionysius: A Commentary on the Texts, 216–26, for an introduction to the traditions of Pseudo-Dionysian interpretation in the middle ages. The notion of a shift in mystical writing towards a new contemplative prioritization of loving over knowing authored primarily by Thomas Gallus is broadly recognized; Turner e.g. writes of Gallus “his tendency was to ameliorate the intellectualism of his mentor’s conception of contemplative activity in favour of a more ‘affective’ or ‘voluntarist’ interpretation” (Eros and Allegory, 318). 9 McGinn, Flowering, 79.10 In Flowering, McGinn quickly drops the subject of the fi rst stream, “speculative"},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":" complications of eros 157knowing in it, nevertheless love and knowing are continuous pursuits; love implies a form of knowing:Gregory the Great coined the slogan for this when he said “Love itself is a kind of knowing” (amor ipse notitia est). The exact nature of this knowing had been richly explored in the twelfth century, especially by Bernard of Clairvaux, William of St Thierry, and Richard of St Victor. These thinkers generally held that the “understanding of love” (intellectus amoris) was built on the mystics’ prior efforts to know and love God, and that, consequently, lower forms of knowing God were subsumed and transformed in the higher state. . . . [ By contrast] Gallus’s understanding of the relation of knowledge to the higher uniting of love differs from this by emphasizing a separation, or cutting off, of all knowing before the fl ight into the amorous unitio deifi cans. In other words, love no longer subsumes preparatory forms of knowing, however necessary; but discards or rejects them (some of his followers were to question whether any prepara-tory knowing was either needed or helpful). Therefore, although Gallus says that the downward infl ux (infl uitio) from the experience of uniting conveys both love and knowledge to the lower powers of the soul, it is not easy to say in what sense the union itself may be characterized as cognitive . . . Whatever we make of this downward movement of knowing, it is clear that Gallus has broken the link between knowing and loving on the upward path to God.11While McGinn reads this affective Dionysianism as dominant after Gallus, particularly in Franciscan mysticism, it does not, of course, provide the only way to conceive of access to God in this period even for Franciscans. Certain works of Ramon Llull stand out as exemplars of a different kind of mystical trend:Llull parts company with the standard Franciscan emphasis on the superi-ority of affectus as the power giving fi nal access to God. Instead, he stresses an intellectualist and universalized understanding of contemplatio . . . The intellect desires knowledge, and when knowledge is attained it produces devotion in the will; there is no apex affectus that surpasses intellect.12Dionysianism,” after Albert the Great, which does not get much play presumably because it is essentially philosophical rather than mystical. While the opposition between philosophy and mysticism is a troubled one, it may be said that overall the philosophical stream has less concern with the mimesis of rapture. In this way John of Morigny certainly fi ts into the category of mystical writers, despite not quite fi tting into the “second stream” as described by McGinn.11 McGinn, Flowering, 82; emphasis original.12 McGinn, Flowering, 135.

As I noted earlier, the goal of John’s ritual text is the acquisition of the seven liberal arts, philoso-phy, and theology through direct infusion by the Holy Spirit, with the assistance of the nine orders of angels by means of prayers targeted to different kinds of knowledge. It is evident from John’s First Procedure that a part of his aim is to close educational gaps between the literate and illiterate, young and old, monks and laypersons.13 The attempt to target his book at a number of different classes of age, ability, and profession is partly conditioned by John’s view of knowledge as an aspect of the divine that ought to be available to everyone. John opens his Book of Prayers with a visionary autobiography, the Liber visionum or Book of Visions, which forms Part I of the Liber fl orum. At the outset of this book, he describes the work of the ritual in terms largely culled from the Ars notoria:Here begins the book of the blessed Virgin, glorious Mary, which is called the Flowers of Heavenly Teaching, for the knowing of all the arts. That which in other books is often in itself grasped with diffi culty by native wit, tediously and at excessive length over a long period of time in enormous and fussy volumes of books, is taught in this book by means of a very few easy prayers, conveyed through the revelation of angels and the subtlety of their unheard words,14 and sometimes, according to the merits of the 13 Different instructions for users are found in First Procedure for priests and lay opera-tors, 3–5 (Graz University Library, MS 680, fols. 131r1–v1) and for uneducated boys, educated boys, and the aged with failing vision 13 (fol. 135v2).14 Making two immediate allusions to the Ars notoria, this rubric adapts two passages from near the opening of the third chapter of the fi rst part of the work. The fi rst passage describes one of Solomon’s apocryphal sources for the Ars in general: “Ipsius orationis exemplar Librum fl orum doctrine celestis Salomon appellauit” (quoted from edi-tion of Ars notoria A in the dissertation by Julien Véronèse, “L’Ars notoria au Moyen Âge,” §38, 696). The second offers a justifi cation of the work’s title: “Incipit tertium capitulum de eo quod ars notoria dicitur ars artium quia omnes et que in ceteris artibus longis et grauibus locutionibus, necnon prolixis et fastidiosis librorum uoluminibus per"},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":" complications of eros 159operator, through the vision, apparition, consolation and help of the undefi led virgin Mary, mother of God, in a short time, subtly, certainly and marvelously, by Him and through Him in whom all things are.15These opening sentences identify access to knowledge with access to the divine (in which lies the origin of all knowledge). Knowledge in the world is available through more toilsome and imperfect worldly means (study) but can also be attained through preparation of the soul to make it receptive to the divine by ascetic means including prayer and fasting. John makes clear that ultimately knowledge cannot enter the human soul without the grace and will of God, but if God permits it, prayer and purifi cation allows a more intimate, easier, and ultimately more perfect contact with knowledge at its source than is offered by study.If, as McGinn says, for Gallus and those affective mystics coming after him, the links between knowing and loving are broken on the upward path to God, for John, the divine pathways, both upward and downward, remain continuous. Like the Ars notoria, but more system-atically, John’s ritual imitates the hierarchy of a course of study. After various ritual preliminaries, partly intended to test the strength and faith of the operators (who must be individually approved by the Virgin), the supplicant ascends through given sets of prayers for each of the liberal arts, from grammar to astronomy (each art identifi ed with an angelic order in John’s text), before taking philosophy (at the level of the Cherubim) and theology (at the level of the Seraphim, identifi ed, as in Gallus and elsewhere, with ardent love). If the fl ow of love from God downward to all things passes in successive stages from higher to lower forms of knowledge, so, in John’s scheme, it is necessary for the soul to be purifi ed and imbued with knowledge in successive stages maximi spatium temporis, a quouis ingeniosissime comprehendebantur in ea uerbis paucis scripto paruissimo placidoque diebus perminimis, a quouis imperito et duro mirabili ac inaudita uerborum ac uirtutum angelicarum subtilitate sciantur” (Véronèse dissertation, Ars notoria A, §32a, p. 694).15 Incipit liber beate Virginis gloriose Marie qui Liber Florum Celestis Doctrine appellatur ad omnes artes sciendas.

These stages are systematically identifi ed with both the angelic orders and the liberal arts, as shown in Table 1 at the end of this chapter. In this schema, knowledge is continuous with love because knowledge is an emanation of Love.Thus one may approach knowledge in the manner of earth (by applying one’s self to books and authors in order to learn what is in them), or, with suffi cient preparation of the soul, one may approach knowledge in the manner of heaven (by appealing directly to the Author of all things). For John as for Llull, intellectual knowing cannot be left behind, for all real knowledge is also always knowledge of the divine. The love that marks the theological apex of this journey (at the level of theology) is continuous with the other forms of knowing that necessarily precede it. However, John’s text, unlike Llull’s, could hardly be described as “intellectualist”; it is not designed to argue, nor to convert, but ritually to enable the personal perfection of the seeker after wisdom. The Liber fl orum refl ects an understanding of the delivery of knowledge fundamentally as a sacramental grace.Ladders of Exegesis: Anagogical Ascent and Ritual Practice Anagogical routes to the divine are predicated on the idea that a process leading to God must begin with bodily and sensory knowledge, lifting the soul upward from the sensible realm to the higher realm of divine Love. Exegesis of the Song offers several models of anagogical uplift-ing that John implements in different ways both to explicate and enact the ritual ascent from lower to higher knowledge. If the uses to which John puts the Song are different from those of the better known affec-tive mystics, he is just the same not less dependent on the commentary tradition. Consider the following extract, a catena of phrases from the Song of Songs, which is taken from John of Morigny’s second of seven prayers which open his Book of the Flowers of Heavenly Teaching:O fairest among women, most sweet virgin Mary, my beautiful love, sweet, amiable and fair beyond measure, in whose aspect, face, and beauty the lover is glad and rejoices, who has doves’ eyes. At whose beauty all human frailty can marvel with vehement admiration, since the sun and moon marvel. Whose shoots are an orchard of pomegranates with pleasant fruits.

And because of this, my kind and most beautiful love, I am made black, but beautiful, like the tents of Kedar, like the pelts of Solomon. Do not look upon me, because I am dark, for the sun has discolored me. But come back, come back, Shunamite, come back so that I may look upon you; and show me, you whom I love, where you feed and where you lie down at noon, lest I begin to wander after the fl ocks of your companions. And because of this, sweetest virgin Mary, my love, you who are among the daughters like a lily among thorns; and you, O daughters of Jerusalem, tell my beloved that I am sick of love.16The speaker of the prayer interweaves sections of the Song involving both masculine and feminine speakers; he addresses the bride (Mary) and the bridegroom (Christ) equally as his beloved, and sometimes refers to himself as if wearing the bride’s own skin (black but beauti-ful).

While this prayer occurs at an early and preparatory stage in John’s system, allu-sions to and quotations from the Song of Songs are scattered throughout the prayers. In addition to its partial and allusive use throughout the prayers, the complete text of the Song occurs as part of the culmi-nating stage of the ritual, in Prayer 30, where as a conclusion to the entire operation for taking the liberal arts, philosophy, and theology, the operator is instructed simply to “recite the entire Canticle” prior to the fi nal Te Deum laudamus.Exegesis in which the Song itself is read as the culminating part of a system for obtaining knowledge has a long history. From an early period we fi nd the Song construed as a form of divine knowledge suitable only to one near enough to spiritual perfection not to be drawn in or dam-aged by the dangers of the letter—that is, it can only be apprehend by the fully qualifi ed exegete, experienced at reading the spiritual sense. Origen, one of the Song’s most infl uential early Christian exegetes,24 alludes to the Christian reception of earlier Jewish traditions to this effect in the Prologue to his commentary:For in the words of Song of Songs there is that food, of which the Apostle says that strong meat is for the perfect . . . If any man who lives only after the fl esh should approach it, to such a one the reading of this Scripture will be the occasion of no small hazard of danger. . . . For they say that with the Hebrews also care is taken to allow no one even to hold this book in his hands who has not reached a full and ripe age. And there is another practice too that we have received from them—namely, that all the Scriptures should be delivered to boys by teachers and wise men, while at the same time the four that they call deuterÔseis25 . . . should be reserved for study till the last.26The four parts of Scripture to be reserved for last are: the beginning of Genesis; the fi rst chapters of Ezekiel, which tell about the cheru-bim; the last chapter of Ezekiel, which describes the building of the 24 Not only because his work was heavily used by Gregory the Great (see Meyvaert, “A New Edition”) but also because both of their commentaries were drawn upon as sources for Glossa Ordinaria.25 Usual Greek translation of Hebrew Mishnah meaning “to repeat” or “do again,” though Lawson queries that Origen is using the word correctly here.26 Origen, Song of Songs Commentary, 24–25.

In the most basic ways, this ranking of the forms of knowledge available through Scripture places the Song in an esoteric tradition of knowledge: along with the other texts to be reserved for last in the study of Scripture, it must be delivered through “teachers and wise men” to a soul appropriately initiated into biblical knowledge; it is not appropriate to one who lives “only after the fl esh” but is to be reserved for “the perfect.”Origen goes on to explicate another system of didactic hierarchies that can be mapped onto the Song and the Solomonic books imme-diately preceding it:And let us fi rst investigate the reason why, when the churches of God have adopted three books from Solomon’s pen, the Book of Proverbs has been put fi rst, that which is called Ecclesiastes second, while the Song of Songs is found in the third place . . . The branches of learning by means of which men generally attain to knowledge of things are the three which the Greeks called Ethics, Physics and Enoptics; them we may call respectively moral, natural and inspective.27Origen defi nes “enoptics” or “inspective” knowledge as “that by which we go beyond things seen and contemplate somewhat of things divine and heavenly, beholding them with the mind alone, for they are beyond the range of bodily sight.”28 He goes on to say that in fact the Greeks probably got the idea for separating knowledge into these three branches from Solomon, who taught moral science in Proverbs, natural science in Ecclesiastes, and inspective science in the Song of Songs.29 Here, the Song is represented as the crowning work of a three part system, mapped on the biblical books of Wisdom, which surpasses but also includes natural knowledge.This understanding of the Song as a type of knowledge that cannot safely be approached by anyone mired in earthly thought is recast in microcosm by John’s three-part prayer, where the catena of the song appears as a kind of contemplative culmination: it enacts but also rewards the operator who has managed to transcend the immediate claims of the body. The structure described by Origen, in which the song represents the fi nal stage, knowledge of invisible realities in a system which includes natural knowledge, is recast in the thirty prayers, where 27 Origen, Song of Songs Commentary, 39–40, and see Dove, Glossa, 4–5.28 Origen, Song of Songs Commentary, 40.29 Origen, Song of Songs Commentary, 40–41."},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":" complications of eros 165in the fi nal stage of the system the operator is instructed to “recite the entire Canticle,”30 thus appropriately concluding the prayer cycle with a book of knowledge available only to those purifi ed by earlier stages of prayer (and learning). Other ways of reading the Song as a mode of knowledge, or as part of a system for obtaining knowledge, occur in the commentaries. Gregory, elaborating from Origen’s ideas, insists on the Song as a mode of access to knowledge. He adopts Origen’s read-ing of the three books (Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, and the Song) as moral, natural and inspective knowledge respectively, suggesting that they are like a “sort of ladder reaching up to contemplation of God”.31 Though Gregory emphasizes more than Origen the distance between the earthly and heavenly, literal and spiritual senses of the text, the mode of know-ing allowed by the Song remains rooted in the knowledge that sustains it. For Gregory, allegoresis is understood not just as the necessary way of reading the Song, but is also described as an anagogical activity that lifts the soul up to God: “For allegory supplies the soul separated far from God with a kind of mechanism by which it is raised to God . . . By that which we do know—out of such are allegories made—divine meanings are clothed and through our understanding of external speech we are brought to an inner understanding.”32 The enlightened reader reads upward, toward the sense of the entire text—which is put together not only from the Song, but from the other Wisdom books, using the activitiy of allegoresis as a ladder. John of Morigny may have been familiar with Gregory’s commentary, at least, since he quotes from one of the passages shared with Origen (a passage also reproduced in the Glossa Ordinaria, though at shorter length).33There is another system of knowledge that is elaborated as part of the commentary on the “kiss of the mouth,” particularly present in the twelfth-century commentators surrounding St. Bernard of Clairvaux. It is elaborated forcefully in the “Brief Commentary” on the Song by William of St Thierry, who begins by explicating the three stages of the love of God: sensual, rational, and spiritual (or intellectual). Like the 30 Graz University Library, MS 680, fol. 130r2.31 Gregory the Great, “Exposition of the Song of Songs,” from the translation in Turner, Eros and Allegory, 224.32 Gregory in Turner translation, 217.33 At the opening of the Liber fi gurarum, Bodleian Library, MS Liturg. 160: “Moyses enim dicit esse quedam non solum sancta, sed eciam Sancta Sanctorum, et alia non solum sabbata sed eciam Sabbata Sabbatorum . . .” fol. 55r.

He states that the purpose of the incarnation was knowledge: “. . . it was for this reason that God himself was made man for all human beings, so that they, who did not know how to think of God, could, through the man they did know . . . raise up their rational power of understanding.”34 The sacramental moment literally embodied in the incarnation thus mir-rors the mental motion stimulated by the act of allegoresis of the Song according to Gregory.William goes on to identify the sensual, rational, and spiritual know-ledge with three types of kiss: “For, corresponding to the three steps of love, there are likewise three kisses of the lover. The fi rst is of those seek-ing forgiveness or reconciliation; the second of those who have gained some merit; the third of contemplatives. The fi rst is to the feet, the second to the hand, the third to the mouth.”35 The kiss of the mouth is the kiss of contemplation, which the bride requests in the fi rst verse of the Song. “We are touched by the kiss,” William writes, “when we are fi lled with love and knowledge.”36The three kisses are also elaborated in the same sense, and at greater length, by Bernard of Clairvaux in the Sermons on the Canticle (par-ticularly sermons three and four) and by another commentator of the same circle, Thomas of Perseigne.37 It is probable that John of Morigny was familiar with one of these glosses on the kiss of the mouth, though it is not clear which (if any) of these writers was his direct source.38 However, he alludes to the motif of the three kisses in the following passage from the Old Compilation version of the Book of Figures, a 34 William of St Thierry, “Brief Commentary,” from the translation in Turner, Eros and Allegory, 281.35 William, in Turner translation, 282.36 William, in Turner translation, 284.37 From translation of Thomas of Perseigne in Turner, Eros and Allegory, 311ff.38 Both Thomas of Perseigne and William of St Thierry use wording that is more abbreviated and concise, hence generally closer to John’s, than Bernard, but none can be identifi ed conclusively as John’s source. One thing that distinguishes John’s use of this motif from the others is that, in the cases of Thomas, William and Bernard, all kisses are addressed to (or delivered by) Christ, not Mary. It is, of course, possible that John appropriated the motif from another source in which Mary was already the addressee of the kisses, but if so I have not found it. Whatever the source may be, it was independent of the Glossa Ordinaria, where this motif does not occur."},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":" complications of eros 167peroration closing the book with a description of the source of the knowledge that informs his own written work:Whence if anyone asks how I knew these things and where I received the things I have written, and am about to write . . . thus do I respond: from the sacred spiritual kiss of the feet of the blessed glorious virgin Mary, which pertains to reconciliation. And of the holy hands of her, which pertains to reward. And of the mouth of her, with its blessed embalsamed honeyed scent, and of her son, our Lord Jesus Christ, which pertains to contemplation. And moreover, from that which is worth more, namely the holy fountain of the breast of the selfsame Virgin, on which spiritually I reclined and slept; and from the emanation of the milk of spiritual grace and mercy of her holy breast, with which Christ was nourished, and I spiritually suckled and was comforted. In the strength of this spiritual food I made my way all the way to Horeb, the mountain of God. And thence did I drink the things which I have written and shall write, the sacred fl owing words of this book.39For John, as for the twelfth-century commentators, the three kisses represent sequential stages of a penitential purifi cation leading to the grace of wisdom. However, we need to take note of the particularities of the associations leading John from the three kisses to the mountain of God. The link between the third kiss of contemplation and the Virgin’s milk, the spiritual grace by which both John and Christ were nourished, in addition to referring to one of his own visions described just previously, is an association that may originate with the opening verses of the Song itself: “Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth / because your breasts are better than wine.”40 In the Glossa Ordinaria, the line “your breasts are better than wine,” in each of its several occur-rences, is read as signifying the milk that is the grace of Christ’s teaching: 39 Vnde si quis interogauerit quomodo ista sciui et vbi accepi que scripsi, et scrip-turus sum . . . sic ei respondebo: ex sacro osculo spirituali pedum beatorum virginis Marie gloriose, quod est reconsiliacionis.

The Old Compilation (preserved only in this one manuscript, so far as is now known) is John’s original draft of the text, completed before 1313; he redrafted and altered signifi cant portions (eliminating this passage) in the New Compilation version, preserved in vari-ous forms in all other known manuscripts.40 Dove, Glossa, 7."},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"168 claire fanger“I desire a kiss, which was my redemption, because your teachings, the milk and nourishment of your children, are better than other forms of instruction.”41 The idea of sacred nourishment provides the link to Mount Horeb, for John quotes a passage from 3 Kings 19:8, which tells how Elijah was sustained in the desert by food given him by an angel; on the strength of this food Elijah walked forty days and forty nights to Horeb to speak to God. Through this sequence, John expresses his sense of being a child of Mary, brother of Christ, and successor to the prophets. It is perhaps unsurprising that at this point a metaphorical identity should be established between the fl owing spiritual milk of the Virgin and the “sacred fl owing words of this book,” equated directly (through the word “fl uenta”) to the Virgin’s milk, and indirectly to Elijah’s angelic bread. Thus John’s prayers for acquisition of the arts and sciences are given a role not merely derived from, but furthering spiritual knowledge—the fl owing words of his book, the prayers and visions, are also spiritual food, allowing other operators to raise them-selves from earthly things into the zone of heavenly knowledge.Prophecy, Exegesis, and the Appropriation of Scriptural AuthorityThe verbal nature of John’s illumination, taken together with his refer-ence to Horeb, suggest that John identifi es himself with the prophets, a construction he makes explicit elsewhere in his writings particularly in the Old Compilation text. He speaks of himself as having been gifted with the grace of prophecy42 and twice mentions a Book of Prophecies43 41 Dove, Glossa, 7; see also glosses on Song 1:3 “mindful of your breasts” (Dove, 13) and 4:10, “more beautiful than wine” (Dove, 92).42 O quis crederet quando librum hunc incepi non solum ad predicacionis graciam immo eciam ad spiritum sanctum prophecie culmen me posse attinxisse.

We do not know whether John ever attempted such a work, but his view of himself as prophet provides another angle of illumination on John’s conception of his enterprise by suggesting that “the words of this book” are in some ways parallel to Scripture.Another passage suggesting that John’s book is equivalent to scripture occurs at the opening of the Old Compilation Book of Figures: For Moses says that some things are not just holy, but indeed Holy of Holies, and others are not just sabbath, but Sabbath of Sabbaths. Thus we say that some things are not just “knowing” but “Knowing of Knowings.” And just as he is blessed who enters into the holy, and more blessed he who enters into the Holy of Holies; and blessed he who celebrates the sabbath, and more blessed he who celebrates the Sabbath of Sabbaths; in the same way blessed is he who enters into knowing and wisdom, but much more blessed he who enters into the Knowing of Knowings and Wisdom of Wisdoms, because all good things come along with Knowing and Wisdom, and immeasurable honor through their hands.44 . . .

The same idea also appears, though in a slightly different and abbreviated form, in the Glossa Ordinaria on the Song.46 The comment concerns the form of the title (why it is called “Song of Songs”): implicitly, then, John’s work, as sciencia scienciarum, stands at a pinnacle of knowledge in a way equivalent to the Song of Songs.Like the Song, too, the Liber fl orum is constituted of prophecy; but beyond this it is a methodology enabling an experience of prophecy for those fi t to receive it. In the Book of Prayers John uses verses from the Song instrumentally, with the goal of obtaining knowledge of all kinds. But John’s instrumental use of these verses is nevertheless founded on an understanding of the Song derived from existing exegesis. Gregory characterized allegoresis as an activity that is “like a ladder” leading to God; John, too, uses a ladder to ascend towards God in the Book of Prayers, and though its most prominent rungs may be the seven liberal arts, we have seen that its larger pattern is not less exegetically derived.The Book of Prayers ends as well on an exegetical note, since the twenty-ninth prayer (for the taking of Theology) beseeches God for delivery, through the Seraphim, of the four senses of Scripture: histori-cal, allegorical, tropological, and anagogical. Each sense of scripture, in addition to being associated with wisdom of a certain type, cor-responds to one of the four directions and one or more of the seven gifts of the holy spirit, so that, for example, part four of this prayer requests of God:that through your Holy Spirit of Wisdom, blowing from the south, through whom alone we contemplate God, in whose heat we catch fi re, I may be able fully and perfectly to taste, understand, discern and know in the science of theology by the tropological arts the invisible things of God the father through the anagogic sense, and through it begin heavenly con-templation, and have in my power the treasury of celestial wisdom.47MS Liturg. 160, 55r–v. The titles “Opus operum” and “Sciencia scienciarum” in fact derives from a work associated with the Ars Notoria, which John goes on to quote; see Véronèse, “L’Ars notoria au Moyen Âge,” 743ff.46 See Dove, Glossa, 4.47 ut per Spiritum tuum Sanctum Sapiencie perfl antem a meridie per quem solum Deum contemplamur, cuius calore accendimur, possim plenarie et perfecte sapere, intel-ligere, discernere et scire in sciencia theologie, operibus tropoloycis, invisibilia Dei patris per sensum anagoicum et per ipsum celestem contemplacionem inchoare, et thesaurum celestis sapiencie possidere.

For John of Mori-gny, it is not only (as Gregory put it) that love is a form of knowledge, but also, emphatically, that knowledge is a form of love; the arts and sciences may thus become part of a ladder that leads to God because of the ways in which these forms of knowledge are actually like God, part of the effusion of the divine love into the embodied world. While the structure of John’s prayers make it clear that exegetical knowledge is the highest form of love, the secret of John’s system as a whole is that there is no form of knowledge that can be other than a refl ection of divine love when the initiate looks upon it with purifi ed intellect. From the top of the ladder to the bottom, love and knowledge are all one thing.John lays claim to an authoritative status comparable to that of the prophets through the fact that he has imbibed in a vision the holy milk of the Virgin. Like Moses or Elijah, he has spoken with God on Mount Horeb; like Solomon, the presumed author of the Song, he has written a text that stands at the apex of Knowing, an epiphany of Wisdom. Like Solomon’s Song, John’s work is fundamentally an initia-tion into the mystery of a Wisdom that is fi gured by eros, a delivery of hidden knowledge in the guise of something known. For in a way that is occulted (from the non-initiate) by that very representation of the experience of love, the Song of Songs offers itself as a source of esoteric knowledge—a knowledge that is veiled by, but also delivered by, the words of the text ritually used and exegetically understood.For John, it is not really a question of fi nding divine love through intellectual process (as, perhaps, for Llull); nor yet of loving the divine to the exclusion or casting away of intellectual process (as, perhaps, for Gallus); nor yet of the kind of spiritual rumination on divine love that breaks the verses of the Song down into their constituent allegorical morphemes, as is offered by Bernard of Clairvaux. For John, the words of the Song become part of a set of spiritual tools by which the operator is led to a state of Adamic purity in which earthly knowledge also may be redeemed. But the Song does more than lift the operator’s soul to God through its implementation in John’s prayers; it becomes part of John’s appropriation of scriptural authority as well. By framing his text with the creative deployment of allegorical understandings of the Song (and in fact by having visions imbued at their very origin by exegesis of the Song) John can manifest himself as an initiate into its mystery."},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":"172 claire fangerTable I: Correspondences in John of Morigny’s PrayersPrayer #Art or DisciplineCelestial BeingsMiracles21GrammarOrdering of speechAssignation of rulesEloquence in grammarAngelsChrist’s conceptionStar leading magiMiracle at CanaCreation 1st day22DialecticIndustry in respondingEloquence in dialecticArchangelsChrist’s undoing fall on crossRedemption of souls from hellDivision of waters 2nd day23RhetoricDiscernmentOrdering parts of speechEloquence in rhetoricOrdering structure of writingThronesPatriarchs, Prophets,Apostles, Evan-gelistsDividing light/dark 1st dayHarrowing of HellRaising of deadAppearance to Mary MagdalenEmergence of land & water, & germina-tion of seeds 3rd day24ArithmeticEloquence in ArithmeticPowersDivision of bread before disciples at Emmaus after resur-rectionArrangement of sun, moon, & stars 4th day25MusicEloquence in MusicVirtuesArrival via locked doors before dis-ciples at EmmausCreation fi sh & birds 5th day26GeometrySpecifi cs of Geom-etryDominationsSaving Peter when he could not walk on waterCreation of animals & humans 6th day27Astronomy/AstrologySpecifi cs of AstronomyPrincipalitiesMartyrs, Con-fessors, Widows Continentes, Holy Monks & HermitsEclipse at passionGod’s rest 7th day"},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":" complications of eros 17328PhilosophyNatural philosophyMoral philosophyEconomical/Political Eloquence in PhilosophyCherubimChrist’s ascent to heaven (for all subdivisions of philosophy)29Theology/Contemplative PhilosophyHistorical, Tropo-logical, Analogical, Allegorical sensesEloquence in TheologySeraphimHoly spirit of West, North, East, SouthVirgin MartyrsImagery from ApocalypsePentecost (for all senses of scripture)BibliographyThe abbreviation PL is used for Patrologia cursus completus: Series Latina, J.P.

Many greater or lesser authors contributed to the development of the genre during the intervening century,1 resulting in an extensive corpus of treatises devoted to “Renaissance love theory.”2 John Charles Nelson, in one of many scholarly studies that have been devoted to the subject, emphasizes that these writerschose to treat love “Platonically” as an intellectual, nonsexual, or even anti-sexual phenomenon. . . .

Sexual activity in itself is identifi ed with ugliness and bestiality. Yet, discussion of the philosophical problems of “divine” and “Platonic” love often lapses into a consideration of “doubts” (dubbi ) concerning “practical” questions of “human” or “vulgar” love.3Given this fact, any contemporary scholar who wishes to make sense of Renaissance love theory has to make a basic methodological choice. A fi rst option—which has been chosen by the overwhelming majority of specialists—is to restrict oneself to analysis of the emic level (i.e. the “author’s point of view”): one tries to explain as faithfully as pos-sible what the author is trying to say in his text, places that text in a historical framework, points out philosophical or literary backgrounds and infl uences, and so on. In the case of Renaissance love theory, this means that one chooses to take the author at his word when he says that love is essentially “intellectual, non-sexual, even anti-sexual,” and then proceeds to explain and contextualize that opinion. The second option—which I will choose in this article—is to try and develop an additional etic perspective as well, i.e. a scholarly one that may be very different (as regards terminology and theoretical assumptions) from the author’s point of view, but that might help us make more sense of what we are studying.4 This implies that the author is not regarded as the fi nal authority regarding his own text: he may well tell us that love is “intellectual, non-sexual, even anti-sexual,” but we want to know why he thinks so and what it means that he seeks to convince us of such a thing. Scholars who restrict themselves to the fi rst approach function 3 Nelson, Renaissance Theory of Love, 70.4 The emic/etic distinction was originally introduced by Kenneth Pike (Language in Relation to a Unifi ed Theory, 38–39) and Marvin Harris (Cultural Materialism, ch. 2), but has come to be understood in new ways in the contexts of cultural anthropology and the study of religion (see e.g. Platvoet, Comparing Religions, 4–5, 21, 29; Snoek, Initiations, 4–8 and passim). Contrary to some current understandings (or misunderstandings) of the distinction, “emic” as understood in this article has nothing to do with taking the “author’s point of view” as normative or with “going native,” and “etic” has nothing to do with reductionist agendas or naïve beliefs about “objectivity.” My perspective can best be explained by an example. If one watches a group of children playing in a park, and asks one of them (or its parents) what they are doing, the answer is likely to be “we are playing.” This “emic” response is indeed quite correct as a description of the childrens’ activity. However, if one asks a child psychologist what the children are doing, one is likely to get an answer like, e.g., “they are engaged in a learning process in which they acquire important social skills.” This “etic” response may be underpinned by complex social and psychological theories using technical language that would not be understandable (and not necessarily very interesting) to the children or their parents, but which make it possible for academics to gain new insights and ask relevant questions that help us better understand child behavior."},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":" under the mantle of love 177essentially as exegetes or “caretakers” of what they study; those who choose for the second take, rather, a “critical” approach to analysis and hermeneutics5We should recognize right at the outset that in the case of Renais-sance love theory, almost any such contemporary etic perspective is bound to collide headlong with the very opinions emically defended by authors such as Marsilio Ficino or Giordano Bruno. For Renaissance platonists it is axiomatic that the intellect is at the top and the body at the bottom of the ontological hierarchy or great chain of being, and that whatever is lower in the hierarchy can only be understood with reference to what is higher; hence it would be wholly absurd to sug-gest that the body and what pertains to the body could be the basis and starting point for understanding things that pertain to the soul or the intellect—in fact, the latter are guaranteed to be misunderstood from such a perspective. That very “absurdity,” however, is essential not only to Freudian psychoanalysis, but to practically all twentieth-century approaches to sexuality and eroticism that have developed in its wake. We assume as axiomatic that men and women are inherently sexual beings, who are known to be capable of sublimating their basic sexual drives into “idealized” versions such as “Platonic love.” Renais-sance thinkers in the tradition of Ficino, on the contrary, assumed that men—for women the case is more complicated, as will be seen—are inherently spiritual beings, who are known to be capable of allowing themselves to be “drawn down” by the body’s sexual appetites so that they end up functioning on a “bestial” level.So we must be clear about the fact that any interpretation of Renais-sance love theorists from a perspective of “idealization” or “sublimation” goes entirely against the grain of their own most cherished convictions and would have been rejected by them as perverse. To prevent misun-derstandings: I do not intend—nor would I have the competence—to “psychoanalyze” Ficino and Bruno and their theories of love; and in fact, given the scarcity of relevant biographical information, I would be extremely skeptical of any attempt in that direction. All I intend to do in what follows is look at their work from the perspective of sexuality, in the—no doubt perverse—hope that this will help us better understand the role of love in their thinking.5 I am alluding to McCutcheon, Critics not Caretakers. McCutcheon’s perspective tends towards “reductionism” whereas mine is empirical/historical, but in my opinion a “critical” approach is basic to both, as distinct from “religionist” approaches (on these distinctions see Hanegraaff, “Empirical Method”)."},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"178 wouter j. hanegraaffFicino’s De AmoreIn 1468 Marsilio Ficino was thirty-fi ve years old and had just com-pleted his translation of Plato’s complete works from Greek into Latin. Throughout his life he had been subject to melancholy moods, and he again found himself in a state of severe mental depression. It appears that his young friend Giovanni Cavalcanti (1444?–1509), to whose sig-nifi cance we will return, suggested that writing a commentary on Plato’s Symposium might help him deal with this affl iction.6 Somehow, therefore, Ficino’s melancholy must have been linked to the problem of love, and the commentary was at least partly an attempt at self-therapy. Origi-nally written in Latin, and dedicated to Cavalcanti, this Commentarium in Convivium Platonis was later translated by Ficino into Italian and is usually referred to as De Amore.7 On November 7, 1468, Ficino and his friends took part in a banquet in his villa in Careggi to celebrate Plato’s birthday.8 De Amore, fi nished in July 1469, is presented as an account of the same banquet; like Plato’s text, it consists of seven speeches about love in the form of commentaries on the speeches of the Symposium.9 Only a very extensive summary and commentary can do justice to its thematic richness and conceptual complexity; here I will provide only the barest general outlines that are necessary to understand Ficino’s views on the relation between love and sexuality.Ficino’s doctrine of love must be understood within the framework of a neoplatonic metaphysics and cosmology based notably upon 6 See Ficino’s contemporary biographer J. Corsi, De Platonicae Philosophiae . . . sive Marsilii Ficini vita . . . VIII, 245, par. VII–VIII; the passage is quoted in full in Marcel, Marsile Ficin, 16–17.7 Both the Latin original and the Italian translation, which contains some additions mainly concerned with astrology, were originally circulated only in manuscript. The fi rst published Latin edition appeared in 1484 in Ficino’s Platonis Opera, and the Italian version was not published until 1544. See Devereux, “The Textual History of Ficino’s De Amore.” A. della Torre’s infl uential thesis (in Storia dell’Academia Platonica di Firenze) that Ficino wrote two versions, of which only the second one was preserved, was defi nitely deconstructed by Marcel in his “Introduction” of 1956.8 On the historicity of this banquet, see Marcel, “Introduction,” 28–36, and Gentile, “Per la storia.”9 The speeches are as follows: (1) Giovanni Cavalcanti comments on Phaedrus’ speech, (2) Giovanni Cavalcanti (stepping in for Antonio degli Agli, Bishop of Fiesole, who has to leave) comments on Pausanias’ speech, (3) Giovanni Cavalcanti (stepping in for Ficino’s father, who also has to leave) comments on Erixymachus’ speech, (4) Christoforo Landino comments on Aristophanes’ speech, (5) Carlo Marsuppini com-ments on Agathon’s speech, (6) Tommaso Benci comments on Socrates’ speech, and (7) Cristoforo Marsuppini comments on Alcibiades’ speech."},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":" under the mantle of love 179Plotinus, Proclus, and Pseudo-Dionysius Areopagita. God has created three “worlds,” referred to as the Angelic Mind, the World Soul, and the World Body.10 The resulting hierarchy, with a descending order that goes from Mind to Soul to Body, gets slightly complicated by a circular imagery used elsewhere: God or the Good is presented as an indivisible point in the center, and Beauty as the divine splendor that emanates from him in four circles: Mind, Soul, Nature, and Matter.11 The divine ray called Beauty creates the species of all things in each of the four circles: Ideas in the Mind, Reasons in the Soul, Seeds in Nature, and Forms in Matter. Occasionally Ficino also refers to other hierarchies, notably that of twelve spheres,12 but in the De Amore as a whole these play a minor role and can be disregarded here.Human souls are born from God, and then literally fall from the Milky Way through the astrological house of Cancer into materiality. In this process they fi rst receive a special kind of transparent “astral body,” which is described as “coarser than the soul, but purer and fi ner than the body”; only after having been wrapped up in this pro-tective covering are they ready for being enclosed in an earthly—and therefore impure—body.13 This strong polarity of pure versus impure is of central importance for understanding Ficino’s approach to love and sexuality.We have seen that all the four circles that emanate from God/the Good—that is to say, the whole of created reality—are actually mani-festations of “Beauty,” which is defi ned as a divine ray or splendor. This Beauty excites desire in us, and this desire is what we call Love: hence Love is defi ned, as in Plato’s Symposium, as “the desire for Beauty.”14 Although Beauty is thus manifest in the entire universe (and Love is likewise universal),15 it is nevertheless evident that in De Amore Ficino is 10 De Amore I, 3; III, 1; V, 4.11 De Amore II, 3; V, 4; VI, 15, 17.12 De Amore VI, 3–4.13 De Amore VI, 4, 6. The doctrine of the astral body derives from Proclus; see Dodds, “The Astral Body in Neo-Platonism.”14 De Amore I, 4.15 Hence the equation between love, nature and magic, as in De Amore VI, 10: “But why do we think that Love is a magician? Because the whole power of magic consists in love. The work of magic is the attraction of one thing by another because of a certain affi nity of nature. . . . And all nature, because of mutual love, is called a magician.” Here love is equated with the universal force of “sympathy” (and in III, 4, Ficino claims that “antipathy” is only a manifestation of it: “No part of the world hates another part,” it is only and exclusively “love that makes the world go around”)."},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"180 wouter j. hanegraaffthinking primarily of human beauty. He does not go into such broader domains as aesthetics or art theory, or expound upon the beauty of the cosmos, the heavens, nature, and so on; instead, his discussion is focused on the beauty of the human soul or body that evokes erotic desire.The divine beauty that is manifested in human beings is threefold: a beauty of souls, of visible bodies, and of audible sounds. The beauty of souls is perceived through the intellect, that of bodies through the eyes, and that of sounds through the ears (i.e., amorous conversation between lovers). These three organs of perception have in common that they are able to perceive a “harmony of different parts,” which for Ficino—at least in this context16—is part of the defi nition of beauty. He argues that the “lower” senses of smell, taste, and touch perceive only “simple forms” (odors, fl avors, heat, cold, softness, hardness, etc.), which therefore do not have beauty. Accordingly, the appetite that fol-lows these senses is not called Love, but “lust or madness.”17Of particular importance is Ficino’s interpretation of the Platonic notion of the “two Aphrodites,” or Venuses, defended by Pausanias in the second speech of the Symposium.18 The fi rst or “heavenly Venus” is located in the Angelic Mind; she is said to have been born without a mother, which means that she is a stranger to matter. The second or “vulgar Venus” is located in the World Soul, in which resides the power of procreation. Accordingly, the fi rst Venus “is entranced by an innate love for understanding the Beauty of God,” whereas the second Venus “is entranced by her love for procreating that same beauty in bodies”; the fi rst Venus “embraces the splendor of divinity in herself,” whereas the second Venus “transfers sparks of that splendor into the Matter of the world.”19 It is very important to understand that, for Ficino, 16 There is a sharp contradiction between De Amore I, 4, where Ficino adopts the Platonic and generally Greek concept of beauty as resulting from harmony and propor-tion among the parts of a thing, and V, 3, where he follows Plotinus in rejecting that concept. See discussion in Nelson, Renaissance Theory of Love, 80–81.17 De Amore I, 4. Cf. previous footnote: De Amore V, 3 would seem to undermine this argument for the inferiority of smell, taste and touch.18 Note that in De Amore VI, 5, Ficino obscures the theory by introducing a third kind of “Venereal daemon,” that comes in three variants according to whether they belong to the element of fi re, of the “purest air” or of “thicker and cloudy air.” He does not develop this notion further.19 De Amore II, 7; cf. VI, 5, 7. This duality is basic to neoplatonic theory as it developed in Christian culture, as demonstrated e.g. by Arthur O. Lovejoy’s classic Great Chain of Being: the divine was conceptualized on the one hand as “the Absolute of otherworldliness” to which the contemplative mind aspires, and on the other as “a God whose prime attribute was generativeness” (315)."},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":" under the mantle of love 181both Venuses are “virtuous and praiseworthy” because both “follow a divine image.”20 Sexual procreation may be a less laudable pursuit that the contemplation of divine beauty, but it is not in itself rejected as evil; on the contrary, in its most positive manifestation the “love of men” dominated by the “vulgar Venus” is praised as “the desire for procreation with a beautiful object [a woman, supposedly] in order to make eternal life available to mortal things.”21Ficino repeatedly emphasizes that the second Venus is called “vul-gar” (elsewhere, a kakodaemon or evil daemon)22 not because it is really evil, but because “on account of our abuse, it often disturbs us and powerfully diverts the soul from its chief good, which consists in the contemplation of truth, and twists it to baser purposes.”23 Sexuality, in our terms, is therefore censured only if it is immoderate, or against the order of nature (i.e. sodomy, on which more below), or if it leads us to prefer the beauty of the body to the beauty of the soul and thus leads us downwards instead of upwards.24 Along the famous Platonic “scale of perfection” that Socrates in the Symposium claims to have learned from Diotima, we are supposed, rather, to climb up step by step from the love of beautiful bodies to the love of beautiful souls, and from there to the fi nal contemplative vision, as famously described by Plato:Whoever has been initiated so far in the mysteries of Love and has viewed all these aspects of the beautiful in due succession, is at last drawing near the fi nal revelation. And now, Socrates, there bursts upon him that wondrous vision which is the very soul of the beauty he has toiled so long for. It is an everlasting loveliness which neither comes nor goes, which neither fl owers nor fades, for such beauty is the same on every hand, the same then as now, here as there, this way as that way, the same to every worshipper as it is to every other.Nor will his vision of the beautiful take the form of a face, or of hands, or of anything that is of the fl esh. It will be neither words, nor knowledge, nor a something that exists in something else, such as a living creature, or the earth, or the heavens, or anything that is—but subsisting of itself and by itself in an eternal oneness, while every lovely thing partakes of it in such sort that, however much the parts may wax and wane, it will be neither more nor less, but still the same inviolable whole.2520 De Amore II, 7; VI, 8, 11.21 De Amore VI, 11.22 De Amore VI, 8.23 De Amore VI, 8.24 De Amore II, 7.25 Plato, Symposium 210e–211b (transl.

Since Love is the desire for timeless and immortal Beauty, in the long run no earthly beauty will be able to satisfy it:the passion of a lover is not extinguished by the sight or touch of any body. For he does not desire this or that body, but he admires, desires and is amazed by the splendor of the celestial majesty shining through bodies. For this reason lovers do not know what they desire or seek, for they do not know God himself, whose secret fl avor infuses a certain very sweet perfume of Himself into His works . . . Since, therefore, attracted by the manifest perfume, we desire the hidden fl avor, we rightly do not know what we are desiring and suffering.26As long as we are making the ascent, Love makes us suffer, because it can drive us mad with desire but never grants us the release of perfect and lasting satisfaction—except, of course, when we fi nally attain the ultimate revelation of everlasting divine beauty. The tortured frenzies of lovers are discussed in some detail by Ficino27 and will play a central role in Giordano Bruno, as will be seen. Ultimately, they result from “forgetfulness” and self-alienation:God is certainly never so deceived as to love the shadow of His own beauty in the Angel and neglect His own true Beauty. Nor is the Angel so taken by the beauty of the Soul, which is its shadow, that it becomes preoccupied with its shadow and forsakes its own beauty. But our soul does. This is greatly to be lamented, for this is the origin of all our woe. Only our soul, I say, is so captivated by the charms of corporeal beauty that it neglects its own beauty, and forgetting itself, runs after the beauty of the body, which is a mere shadow of its own beauty.Hence the tragic fate of Narcissus . . . Hence the pitiable calamity of men. . . . the soul admires in the body, which is unstable and in fl ux, like water, a beauty which is the shadow of the soul itself. He abandons his own beauty, but he never reaches the refl ection. That is, the soul, in pursuing the body, neglects itself, but fi nds no gratifi cation in its use of the body. For it does not really desire the body itself; rather . . . it desires its own beauty. And since it never notices the fact that, while it is desir-ing one thing, it is pursuing another, it never satisfi es its desire. For this reason, melted into tears, he is destroyed; that is, when the soul is located outside itself, in this way, and has sunken into the body, it is racked by terrible passions and, stained by the fi lths of the body, it dies, as it were, since it now seems to be a body rather than a soul.2826 De Amore II, 6.27 De Amore II, 6, 8; VI, 9, 17; VII, 3, 11, 14.28 De Amore VI, 17."},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":" under the mantle of love 183An expression like “the fi lth of the body” is no exception in De Amore.29 The beauty of human bodies may be admired, and the procreation of new bodies may be duly praised as “virtuous and praiseworthy,” but in fact there seems to be a strong confl ict in Ficino’s mind between his theoretical acceptance of procreation and what seems to be a deep-seated abhorrence of “touching”—a term that can be taken here as practically synonymous with “sexual activity.” The pleasures of touch “remove the intellect from its proper state and perturb the man,” and the “desire for coitus” is in fact the opposite of Love.30 It seems that Ficino’s rejection of “touching” grew even stronger as he got older: in his De Vita (1489) he no longer described the second Venus as “virtu-ous and praiseworthy” but as a machiavellian enemy masquerading as a friend but intent only on stealing our vital energy in the interest of procreation, and as a prostitute who seduces the young by promising (rather than giving) them the “lethal” pleasures of touch.Venus endowed you with only one pleasure, and that harmful, with which she harms you but profi ts those to come, little by little draining you as it were through a secret pipe, fi lling and procreating another thing with your fl uid, and leaving you fi nally as if you were an old skin of a cicada drained upon the ground, while she looks after the fresh cicada. . . .

The greater the delight experienced in touching and tasting, the graver damage frequently befalls. . . . [therefore] shun deceitful Venus in her blandishments of touching and tasting . . . and restrain with the continual reins of prudence the lust . . . for procreation.3129 Cf. De Amore VI, 10 about “those who debase themselves in the excrements of the body.” For discussions of the body (usually as a “mere shadow,” and as the force that “draws down” the soul), see also De Amore I, 4; II, 4, 9; IV, 3–5; V, 3–6; VI, 10, 17; VII, 12, 15.30 De Amore I, 4; cf. II, 9. See also e.g. Ficino in a letter to Cavalcanti: “. . . it is not love when the appetite of the other senses drives us rather towards matter, mass, weight and the deformity that is the opposite of beauty or love, but a stupid, gross and ugly lust.” (The Letters of Marsilio Ficino, I, 63 [ letter 47, no date])31 De Vita II, 15 (transl. Kaske & Clark). This attitude eventually earned him the criticism of Agostino Nifo, a leading Aristotelian philosopher, who argued that the sense of touch is capable of transmitting beauty to the soul, and who even anticipates Freud in arguing that there is no human love without sexual desire and carnal lust (see Kraye, “Ficino in the Firing Line,” 384–385). To leave no ambiguity in this regard, Nifo wrote that even “a father cannot enjoy the beauty of his daughters, nor can heroic and saintly men or philosophers enjoy the beauty of young women and men without sexual desire being aroused” (Nifo, Libri duo, Lyons 1549, 106, as quoted in Kraye)."},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"184 wouter j. hanegraaffThe Nature of “Socratic Love”As the above overview hopefully demonstrates, it is quite possible to describe Ficino’s basic ideal of “Socratic love”32 in abstract and general terms, without ever needing to ask oneself what the actual practice of such love would look like. And in fact almost all scholarly commentaries and analyses of De amore have taken such an approach, with the effect of marginalizing or altogether ignoring one of the most striking facts about the text: its explicit and consistent homoerotic orientation.33 Throughout De amore, love is described as a desire that is excited in the minds of men when they behold the beauty of other men. Women are completely and utterly absent.34 If female beauty is mentioned at all—but it very 32 The term “Platonic love” was fi rst used by Ficino, in his commentary on the Phaedrus, ch. 1 (see text and translation in Allen, Marsilio Ficino and the Phaedran Chari-oteer, 72–73; and see also Allen, The Platonism of Marsilio Ficino, esp. chs. 7 and 8) He speaks of “Platonic and Socratic Love,” and later again speaks of “Socratic Love” only; apparently he does not intend to differentiate between the two terms but uses them as synonyms.33 In his major biography of Ficino, Marcel apparently believed that all he needed to do was exonerate Ficino from any “suspicion”: referring to Ficino’s amorous letters to Cavalcanti (see text), he writes “Actually the tone of this correspondence surprises us somewhat, and if nowadays it causes some people to smile, others have found it suspect. Alas, the return to Antiquity had not caused only its virtues to revive, but fortunately we know that Ficino never failed to denounce and condemn the depravities of his century, and that in this domain he always remained above any suspicion” (Marcel, Marsile Ficin, 343–344). Such a passage may be merely amusing to us, as refl ecting a pre-sexual revolution perspective. More surprising is that the homoeroticism of De Amore is likewise silently passed over in recent editions such as the German translation by Blum (Über die Liebe, 1984), Jayne (Commentary, 1985; on 19 he merely says that the work “had been written for and about men”), and Laurens (Marsile Ficin: Commentaire, 2002; on XLII he merely mentions the “exclusion of woman, inherited from Plato himself ” as one of the text’s “implicit limitations”). In contrast, in the wake of a pioneering article by Giovanni Dall’Orto (“ ‘Socratic Love,’ ” 1989) Ficino has been claimed for the history of homosexuality in most of that discipline’s recent reference works, including the Encyclopedia of Homosexuality (1990; Dall’Orto, “Ficino, Marsilio”), Gay Histories and Cultures (2000; Maggi, ‘Renaissance Neoplatonism’), or Who’s Who in Gay & Lesbian History (2001; Dall’Orto, “Ficino, Marsilio”). Among mainstream Ficino specialists, as far as I am aware only Kraye (“The Transformation of Platonic Love” and “Ficino in the Firing Line”) discusses the homoeroticism at any length. The lacuna is also noted in a recent article by Marc Schachter (“Louis Le Roy’s Sympose de Platon,” 409).34 That Ficino lived in a man’s world where women played no role of any signifi -cance is quite clear. I do not know how much credence, if any, should be leant to the offensive vulgarity with which he had supposedly spoken about women according to Angelo Poliziano’s Detti piacevoli 185: “Messer Marsilio dice che si vuole usare le donne come gl’orinali, che, come l’uomo v’ha pisciato drentro, si nascondono e ripongono” (“Messer Marsilio says that women should be used as urinals, which, when a man has pissed in them, are hidden and put away”)."},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":" under the mantle of love 185rarely seems to occur to Ficino that women might be beautiful—its only function is to get men to procreate “handsome offspring,”35 that is to say, it belongs to the domain of the “vulgar Venus.” The superior spiritual love under the reign of the “heavenly Venus” is, in spite of that goddess’ female identity, the exclusive preserve of men.Obviously this homoerotic orientation fi nds its origin in the fact that Plato’s Symposium itself likewise concentrates entirely on love between men. However, this is not suffi cient to account for Ficino’s surprisingly open and non-apologetic approach. Contrary to him, Leonardo Bruni, the fi rst author to try his hand at translating Plato, had felt obliged to bowdlerize his Latin translations from the Phaedrus (1424) and the Symposium (1435): thus Alcibiades’ notorious attempt to seduce Socrates “is high-handedly converted into a story of how Alcibiades pursued Socrates for his wisdom, and all other references to homosexuality, fl uteplaying and paganism are systematically expunged.”36 Bruni’s con-temporary Ambrogio Traversari translated the homoerotic love poems attributed to Plato in Diogenes Laertius’ Lives of the Philosophers (III, 23), but crossed them through in the manuscript and omitted them from the published version of 1433 (interestingly though, in Ficino’s copy of the latter, the poems had again been added in the margin, apparently copied from Traversari’s manuscript).37 The poet Antonio Panormita quoted Plato in support of his pornographic Hermaphroditus (1425), dedicated to Cosimo de’ Medici, but that book was publicly burned and readers were threatened with excommunication by Pope Eugene IV in the early 1430s.38 And in 1455 the Byzantine Aristotelian George of Trebizond, who hated Plato, notoriously accused him of pervert-ing the minds of princes and leading them to sodomy: “O slothful 35 If I’m not mistaken, the very fi rst mention of female beauty occurs as late in De Amore as VI, 11 (spetiosa femina).36 Hankins, Plato in the Italian Renaissance, 80 (the term “homosexuality” is problematic in this context and should better be replaced by “homoeroticism”). Jayne (“Introduc-tion,” 9) is therefore mistaken in suggesting that Bruni was attracted to the passage for pornographic reasons, and that he translated only this part of the Symposium because he found to his disappointment that “the dialogue as a whole did not live up to its bawdy reputation.”37 Hankins, Plato in the Italian Renaissance, 81 n. 120. Again, the poems are more properly described as “homoerotic,” even though they contain a notorious passage on Plato actually kissing Agathon (“While kissing Agathon, my soul did rise, / And hover’d o’er my lips; wishing perchance, / O’er anxious that it was, to migrate to him”). It sometimes happened that Renaissance authors heterosexualized the poems, e.g. by changing the boy Aster into “puella Stella” (Hankins, 131 n. 48).38 Hankins, Plato in the Italian Renaissance, 81, 131."},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":"186 wouter j. hanegraaffminds . . . of the powerful friends of Plato, locked up most shamefully within the thighs of boys! . . . if only they [would] despise Plato and leave the buttocks alone.”39Ficino knew all this and was therefore perfectly aware that “Socratic love” was often interpreted as involving sexual intercourse between men.40 But rather than being embarrassed, he seems to have consid-ered it completely obvious that philosophers of such an exalted stature as Socrates and Plato could not possibly have confused love and sex. On the contrary, it is their detractors who, in doing so, reveal their “dirty minds.” Critics like George of Trebizond should be ashamed of themselves:the desire for coitus (that is, for copulation) and love are shown to be not only not the same motions, but opposite. . . . No name which is suitable for God is common with sinful things. Therefore anyone who is of sound mind ought to be careful lest he heedlessly apply the term love, a divine name, to foolish perturbations. Let Dicaearchus blush, and anyone else who dares to slander the Platonic majesty, on the ground that he indulged too much in love. For we can never indulge too much, or even enough, in passions which are decorous, virtuous, and divine.41We have no reason to doubt that Ficino was sincere. But by no means does that imply (as most specialists seem to have assumed) that the homoeroticism of De amore, or its relationship to what we nowadays would call “homosexuality,”42 is a non-issue that can be dismissed as irrelevant to the question of what Ficino means by “love.”39 In comparationes Aristotelis et Platonis III, 17, according to the Latin quoted in Dall’Orto, “ ‘Socratic Love,’ ” 40; a chapter earlier, George deplored how Eastern monks have lapsed into venereal love “just from reading Plato.” Cf. Kraye, “The Transformation of Platonic Love,” 77, and Hankins, Plato in the Italian Renaissance, 165–192 and 236–263.40 Cf. also Giovanni Pico della Mirandola’s Commento to Girolamo Benivieni’s Dell’amore celeste e divino, ch. 3, 83–84, who refutes the belief shared by “many people” that Socrates performed “fi lthy actions” with their beloved ones.41 De Amore I, 4. The reference to Dicaearchus of Messene, a pupil of Aristotle, is probably based on a statement in Cicero, Tusc. 4.34.71. But indirectly the passage is directed against George of Trebizond, who quotes Dicaearchus as an authority for his accusations regarding Plato’s immorality ( Jayne, Commentary, 44 n. 28).42 See Rocke, Forbidden Friendships, 10–16 and Dall’Orto, “ ‘Socratic Love,’ ” passim, for the problematics of applying this modern concept to early modern contexts. I agree with Dall’Orto’s conclusion that, contrary to post-Foucaultian orthodoxy in the history of sexuality, “the Italian Cinquecento not only saw the connection between homo-sexuality and homoeroticism, but could see it so clearly that it could not distinguish"},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":" under the mantle of love 187That there is more to the homoeroticism of De Amore than mere faithfulness to the Platonic model becomes clear when we look at Ficino’s relation to his younger friend Giovannni Cavalcanti. It was Cavalcanti who fi rst suggested the idea of the Symposium commentary, Ficino dedicated it to him, and he plays a disproportionately important role in it by having no less than three of the seven speeches attributed to him.43 The short dedication of De Amore to Cavalcanti should here be quoted in full:Marsilio Ficino to Giovanni Cavalcanti, his unique friend. Good luck!Since a long time, my sweetest Giovanni, had I learned from Orpheus that love existed and that he possessed the keys of the universe. Next, Plato had revealed to me the defi nition and the nature of this love. But that this god love possessed such power was concealed from me for thirty-four years. Then a hero,44 a man who was already divine, looked favorably upon me with his heavenly eyes,45 with a wonderful bending of his head towards me, he showed me the extent of love’s power. Afterwards, therefore, I composed this book on love, assuming I had now been instructed to the full in matters of love. And since I wrote it in my own hand, I decided to dedicate it to you before all others, and so to give back to you what belongs to you.46The “hero” whose heavenly gaze taught Ficino the power of love was Cavalcanti himself. In addition to this preface, we have a substantial number of amorous letters from Ficino to Cavalcanti, which convey a remarkable picture of their relationship. Already in Plato there is a homoeroticism (as theorized by Socratic love) from sodomy” (“ ‘Socratic Love,’ ” 62). This does not need to imply that modern concepts of a homosexual or gay identity can be transposed back to the fi fteenth century. On this problematics, cf. Halperin, How to do the History of Homosexuality, esp. the chapter “Forgetting Foucault”).43 Ficino also dedicated his De Raptu Pauli, and his translations of Alcinous, Speu-sippus and Pythagoras to Cavalcanti (Marcel, Marsile Ficin, 34 n. 1). On Cavalcanti’s contribution to the argument of De Amore, see the detailed analysis in Allen, “Cos-mogony and Love.”44 The term “hero” is important in Renaissance love literature. Ficino often referred to Cavalcanti as a divine “hero” (De Amore I, 1, and many letters), he used the same term for the “third order” of daemons associated with the planet Venus, and linked the term etymologically with the Greek “eros” (De Amore VI, 5; and see explanation in Allen, “Cosmogony and Love,” 134 n. 13). Giordano Bruno’s concept of “heroic” frenzies adds even more complexity to the term.45 See De Amore VII, 4 for a detailed discussion of how the eye of the younger man shoots out “rays” by which the older man is “bewitched.”46 See facs. in Marcel, Marsile Ficin: Commentaire, 135; and transcription with translation of all but the fi rst two sentences in Allen, “Cosmogony and Love,” 135 n. 18."},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"188 wouter j. hanegraaffhierarchical relation between the older man, who plays the role of the lover, and the young boy, who plays the role of the beloved: while both partners are “learning” from the experience, the former loves and the latter is being loved.

Virtuous, useful, and pleasant to both. The virtue certainly is equal to both. For it is equally virtuous to learn and to teach. The pleasure is greater in the older man, who is pleased in both sight and intellect. But in the younger man the usefulness is greater.47Ficino clearly idealized his relationship with Cavalcanti along such Pla-tonic lines,48 for in fact the latter appears to have been considerably less enthusiastic.49 As a result, while Ficino was supposedly in the superior position, in fact his letters show him pleading for Cavalcanti’s attention to a humiliating extent.50 He calls Cavalcanti “his own heart,” “his eye,” and “his salvation”; he admits that without him, life loses all joy and complains that “not even heavenly things have any value without you”;51 and he constantly asks him for advice or even permission in all matters.52 Admittedly the “amatory letter” was a literary genre in 47 De Amore II, 9. Cf. in this respect the amazing passage in a letter to Cavalcanti dated 29 January 1476 (The Letters of Marsilio Ficino II, 56): “It is well known with what pleasure all men, even little men, admire their own image in mirrors. But a friend sees deep in a friend not merely his own image, but his very self. For even though I certainly seem beautiful within, in stature I am a little man, thin and short. Yet in the human mirror descended from God, whence I have loved, I have seen myself these twenty-fi ve years as fi rst manifest: the fi rst among men and not a dwarf.” Note that, in context, the “mirror descended from God” is no one else but Cavalcanti.48 See e.g. undated Letter 51 (in The Letters of Marsilio Ficino I, 68–70), where he writes that all of the great ancient theologians (Zoroaster, Hermes Trismegistus, Orpheus, Plato) “have always thought it necessary to have God as their guide, and a man as companion,” and concluded that “I hold the friendship of Giovanni Cavalcanti and Marsilio Ficino worthy of being numbered among those I have just mentioned.”49 Dall’Orto, “ ‘Socratic Love,’ ” 41.50 The Letters of Marsilio Ficino contain abundant evidence: e.g. “Come back, my hero! Hurry! Fly to me, I beg you” (I, 43 [letter 30]), “how is it that you don’t write?” (I, 46 [letter 34]), “. . . what shall I do? Shall I be the fi rst to write? Or shall I wait for a letter from you?” (I, 48 [ letter 36]), “You alone are my care Giovanni. You alone are my solace. Comfort your Marsilio, I beg, with your letters” (II, 11 [letter 4]), and (when Cavalcanti expresses some irritation at being “overwhelmed”), “My hero, what is it that you are saying so politely about our correspondence? . . . Why does the number of my letters disturb you?” (IV, 13 [letter 8]), “why do you now not reply to so many of my letters?” (IV, 20 [letter 14]). 51 The Letters I, 61 (letter 45).52 Marcel, Marsile Ficin, 343."},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":" under the mantle of love 189this period, and not any expression of “love” needs to be taken at face value;53 but even taking such conventions into account, it is impossible to read the entire collection of Ficino’s letters to Cavalcanti (and the occasional responses by the latter) without being convinced that, in our terms, Ficino was head over heels in love with Cavalcanti.Ficino always spoke of his special affection for Cavalcanti in the terms of Socratic love, modeled after the relation of Socrates to his younger pupils such as Phaedrus or Alcibiades; and although he would have readily described the relation as “erotic,” he was concerned to play down the implicit sexual connotations which would make us rec-ognize such a relationship as “homoerotic.” Yet, Ficino was well aware of the connection, as we have already seen, and he occasionally made it explicit. One of the most revealing statements is found in a letter, where he writes to Cavalcanti that “Marsilio is closer to your thoughts than are your tongue and hand. That is why between your mind and mine the ministry of tongue and hand cannot intervene.”54 Of course, apart from the explicit reference to French kissing, tongue and hand stand here for the two rejected senses of taste and touch.To put such statements in context, we must realize that precisely Florence, of all places, had a longstanding international reputation as the city of sodomy—the closest contemporary equivalent (although not a synonym) of our modern concept of homosexuality.55 This was true even to such an extent that in German fl orenzen meant “to sodomize” and sodomites were called Florenzer.56 Furthermore, as pointed out by 53 Compare in this regard Ficino’s correspondence with Lorenzo de’ Medici, which was equally an “experiment in Platonic friendship” (see Wadsworth, “Lorenzo de’ Medici and Marsilio Ficino”).54 The Letters of Marsilio Ficino IV, 21 (letter 14, undated). Cf. also passages such as VI, 10, that refl ect a confl ict with which Ficino must have been personally familiar: “Sometimes a desire for caressing arises, but sometimes a chaste desire for heavenly beauty, and now that and now this conquers and leads him.”55 As pointed out by Rocke, “People of the Middle Ages and early modern period lacked the words to convey the precise equivalents of the current ‘homosexuality’ as a distinct category of erotic experience or ‘homosexual’ as a person or a sexual identity” (Forbidden Friendships, 11). Sodomy was not strictly synonymous with our “homosexuality,” for it referred to acts “contrary to nature” that could be performed between men and women. Nevertheless, in practice, when Florentines used the term, they were thinking of male-male relations, because these were most common and aroused the greatest public concern (Forbidden Friendships, 12).56 Rocke, Forbidden Friendships, 3, with reference to Davidsohn, Storia di Firenze 7, 612. Rocke also calls attention to a dialogue (written in the 1560s) about “masculine love” by the art theorist and critic Gian Paolo Lomazzo, in which no one less than Leonardo da Vinci is asked about his sexual relationship with his young favorite Salai: “Did you"},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"190 wouter j. hanegraaffRocke on the basis of thorough study of the archival sources, sodomy between males almost always “assumed a hierarchical form that would now be called ‘pederasty’ ”: sex between mature men was in fact the exception.57 The remarkable reputation of Florence can be partly explained from local marriage patterns: men usually married late, and fi scal censuses show that about three quarters of the male population between eighteen and thirty-two were bachelors. This group seems frequently to have found sexual solace in homosexual relationships with boys, although even married men occasionally kept up the practice.58 But widespread though it was, sodomy was always illegal. Laws had been in place since the early fourteenth century, and these were strongly enforced in Florence from 1432 to 1502 by a special judiciary magistracy called the Uffi ciali di notte (Offi ce of the Night). Its systematic persecu-tion of sodomy resulted in an abundance of trial records, which show that in this small city of ca. 40,000 inhabitants, during the last four decades of the fi fteenth century, each year an average of 400 people were implicated and 55 to 60 condemned for sodomy; over the whole period during which the Offi ce of the Night was active, at least 17.000 individuals were incriminated and around 3000 convicted.59Surprisingly, in Rocke’s exhaustive study of Florentine homosexual culture, Ficino is not mentioned even once. Ficino clearly (and unsurpris-ingly) shared the offi cial rejection of sodomy and discusses it in De Amore only after having excused himself for touching upon the subject:Shall I say what follows, chaste gentlemen, or shall I rather omit it? I shall certainly say it, since the subject requires it, even if it seems out of place to say. For who can say offensive things inoffensively? The great transformation which occurs in an older man who is inclined towards the likeness of a younger causes him to want to transfer his whole body into the youth, and to draw the whole of the youth into himself . . . Hence they are driven to do many sinful things together. For since the genital semen fl ows down from the whole body, they believe that merely by ejaculating or receiving this, they can give or receive the whole body.60play the game from behind, which the Florentines love so much?”; and to Antonio Beccadelli’s Hermaphroditus (ca. 1425), which mentions the sexual tastes of the Tuscans: “You’re a Tuscan, and Tuscans love cock” (see Rocke, Forbidden Friendships, 255 n. 4).57 Rocke, Forbidden Friendships, 12–13. Masculine identity depended on whether a man took the “active” or the “passive” role, not on whether he had sex with men or women. Hence sexual relations with a boy did not call into question a man’s masculinity, but taking a passive role would be considered “feminine” and dishonorable (13).58 Rocke, Forbidden Friendships, 14–15.59 Rocke, Forbidden Friendships, 4.60 De Amore VII, 6."},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":" under the mantle of love 191Interestingly, he does not continue to condemn sodomy outright in this chapter; but such condemnation is implicit in an earlier passage:But since the reproductive drive of the soul, being without cognition, makes no distinction between the sexes, nevertheless, it is naturally aroused for copulation whenever we judge any body to be beautiful; and it often happens that those who associate with males, in order to satisfy the demands of the genital part, copulate with them. . . . But it should have been noticed that the purpose of erections of the genital part is not the useless act of ejaculation, but the function of fertilizing and procreat-ing; the part should have been redirected from males to females. We think that is was by some error of this kind that that wicked crime arose which Plato in his Laws roundly curses as a form of murder.61 Certainly a person who snatches away a man about to be born must be considered a murderer . . .62These are the only two passages in De Amore that explicitly discuss sodomy. Interestingly, they both suggest that Ficino rejected the practice primar-ily because it implied a “waste of semen,” that is thus robbed of its chance to produce offspring.63I repeat that we have no reason for imagining Ficino as actively engaged in Florence’s fl ourishing homosexual underground culture. But he must have been well aware of its existence; and he knew that “Socratic love” had been associated with sodomy for quite some time, so that we cannot assume he was simply naive in describing love as a purely non-sexual “desire for beauty.” Moreover, some passages of De Amore refl ect an anguish and confl ict that can hardly be read as other than autobiographical. Notably in the long and important tenth chapter of Speech VI, Ficino discusses the temptation of “touching,” the “rays” that shoot from the eyes of a young man, and the magical and even daemonic power of love; and he even foreshadows modern perspectives on sexual sublimation by stating that it is in fact “that continuous ardor of concupiscence” which “impels some to the study of letters, others to music, or painting, others to virtue of conduct, or the religious life, 61 Laws 1.636b–d, 8.836b–838c, 841d.

Hence the possibility of considering the alchemical production of a homunculus in an artifi cial womb (on this subject, see Newman, Promethean Ambitions, ch. 4)."},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"192 wouter j. hanegraaffothers to honors, some to making money, many to the pleasures of the stomach and of Venus, and others to other things.” The chapter culminates in a particularly emotional passage, which must refl ect his ambivalent feelings about Cavalcanti:. . . neither animal nor human love can ever exist without hate. Who would not hate one who took his soul away from him? For as liberty is more pleasant than anything else, so servitude is more unpleasant. And so you hate and love beautiful men at the same time; you hate them as thieves and murderers; you are also forced to love and revere them as mirrors sparkling with the heavenly glow. What can you do, O wretch? Where to turn, you do not know; alas, O lost soul, you do not know. You would not want to be with this murderer of yourself, but you would not want to live without his blessed sight. You cannot be with this man who destroys you, who tortures you. You cannot live without him, who, with wonderful enticements, steals you from yourself, who claims all of you for himself. You want to fl ee him . . . You also want to cling to him . . . You seek yourself outside yourself, O wretch, and you cling to your captor in order that you may sometime ransom your captive self.64Against the background of such passages, some conclusions about De Amore impose themselves. In 1956 Raymond Marcel devoted some pages to Ficino’s “crisis” of 1468, as a “cure” for which Cavalcanti suggested that he write a commentary on Plato’s Symposium.65 Marcel concluded that the crisis was possibly of a religious nature (the confl ict between Christianity and the pagan Greek and Latin philosophers), or a philo-sophical one (the confl ict between Aristotle and Plato), or that it could have been inspired by political events (Pope Paul II’s campaign against humanistic learning, with the suppression of the Roman Academy in February 1468).66 He did not consider, however, what would seem to be by far the most natural explanation: that Ficino wrote De Amore to deal with a personal crisis of love.Temperamental inclinations apart, the melancholy moods and states of depression that had plagued Ficino throughout his adult life can plausibly be explained as having a background in the sexual frustration common among unmarried Florentines of his generation. Many of his male contemporaries who found themselves in a similar situation were probably not, in our modern terms, “homosexuals”; they simply needed 64 De Amore VI, 10.65 Marcel, “Introduction,” 16–22; see also the discussion in Allen, Marsilio Ficino: The Philebus Commentary, 10–11.66 Marcel, Marsile Ficin, 335–353."},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":" under the mantle of love 193an outlet for their sexual energies and found it both in female prosti-tution and in sodomy.67 Ficino, however, was probably homosexually inclined to begin with, so that the former option held no attraction to him; the latter, however, he seems to have severely rejected on moral and religious grounds. Thus no other option was open to him but sup-pression and sublimation of his sexuality. Then two things happened. First, at thirty-four, he fell in love with Giovanni Cavalcanti; and this naturally rekindled in him a strong desire for “touching.” And second, this happened at a time when there was quite some publicity about Pope Paul II’s suppression of the Roman Academy. In mentioning this as a “political” background to Ficino’s crisis, Raymond Marcel did not mention that sodomy was among the main charges against the Academy’s members and their “neo-pagan” activities.68 It is not diffi cult to understand how these two developments would have affected Ficino and could have induced the “crisis”: Paul II’s condemnation amounted to an attack on the kind of humanistic culture represented by people like Ficino himself, it highlighted the possible connection between that culture and homosexual activity, and this at a time when the temptation of giving in to his sexual desire must have haunted Ficino’s fantasies in the very concrete person of Cavalcanti. De Amore did two things for him: it allowed him not only to sum up the essence of the Platonic philosophy to which he had been devoting himself during the previous years of translating Plato’s complete dialogues, but also to “process” his personal experience with love and desire by means of a philosophi-cal synthesis that fi nally succeeded in resolving his inner confl ict. The doctrine of De Amore explained the anguish he felt, and thus in a way legitimated it as something natural, while at the same time leaving no doubt about the direction he should take: that of transcending his bodily desires and allowing love itself to direct him upwards toward the divine. This is the path he took. A few years later, in December 67 Rocke, Forbidden Friendships, 125, 160 found that Florentines apparently saw noth-ing strange in pursuing both.68 See Dall’Orto about the Roman Academy’s leader Pomponio Leto, who was charged with sodomy for being too attached to two boys, whose beauty he had praised in Latin writings. Leto admitted to having praised the boys’ beauty, but in defending himself he referred to Socrates as his model (see passages from Leto’s defensio in Carini, La “difesa” di Pomponio Leto, 36–37, as quoted in Dall’Orto “ ‘Socratic Love,’ ” 45). Since he apparently believed this comparison would work in his favor, he must have considered it beyond dispute (like Ficino, but contrary to e.g. George of Trebizond) that Socrates could not have practiced anything but “chaste” love."},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"194 wouter j. hanegraaff1473, Ficino was ordained into the priesthood, and we are told that after De Amore he did fi nd the peace of mind that had eluded him in his younger years.From Socratic to Platonic Love:The Heterosexualization of ErosOf course, the Renaissance tradition of love theory was not inspired by Plato alone, and the ideal that eventually came to be known as “Platonic love” did not emerge only from the homoerotic perspective of Ficino’s De Amore. The development of love theory from the middle ages through the Renaissance has been described by many authors and will here be summarized only in its bare outlines.69 The spiritual love for God, or caritas, had been seen as something entirely different from mere sensual love, or cupiditas, through most of the middle ages; but these two concepts began to mingle in the chivalric ideal of courtly love that we know from an abundance of literary sources since the twelfth century. Here, the sensual love between men and women was sublimated into a new spiritualized concept, where the male poet is entirely devoted to his idealized lady. Robb summarizes the code of correct behavior that governed such relations: “the lady . . . was regarded as a feudal superior who received from her lover the same honour and service as were given by a true knight to his liege-lord[, and] in return she was expected to be gracious to him and to encourage him in all courtesy and valour.”70 More than that, in what would nowadays be recognized as a sadomasochistic erotic relation with the male in the voluntarily submissive role, the woman was idealized as an unattainable being of more than earthly perfection who could be contemplated and adored but never touched. The lover suffers terribly, because his desire remains forever unsatisfi ed, but he is happy to make this sacrifi ce for his lady’s sake. In fact, it is by means of this very suffering that he is purifi ed and lifted up to the higher spiritual state that she represents.69 See e.g. Pfl aum, Die Idee der Liebe Leone Ebreo, ch. I: “Die Idee der Liebe in ihrem Wandel vom Mittelalter zur Renaissance”; Festugière, La philosophie de l’amour de Marsile Ficin, ch. 1: “L’amour courtois”; de Rougemont, Love in the Western World; Robb, Neopla-tonism of the Italian Renaissance, ch.

The courtly ideal is intensely erotic (in a modern sense) because of its very emphasis on permanently unsatisfi ed desire; its bliss lies in the suffering that results from the unresolved confl ict between body and spirit. Dante’s Beatrice, in contrast, is no longer an object of erotic desire. She becomes a saintly and angelic being who has far transcended all sensuality: as such, she represents an ascetic spiritual ideal that can only be attained by overcoming the world and its temptations.This idea that a beautiful woman can represent the divine ideal is likewise strongly present in Petrarch (1304–1374), but he described the corporeal beauty of Laura much more concretely, with plenty of atten-tion to physical details. And most important, for him Laura was simul-taneously a spiritual ideal and his dream partner for making love:May I be with her when the sun departs,and seen by no one but the stars, for one sole night, and may there be no dawn:and may she not be changed to green woodland,issuing from my arms, as on the daywhen Apollo pursued her down here on earth.71While the medieval courtly poets idealized the suffering of unsatisfi ed desire, Petrarch dreamt of satisfying his desire; and as a result, he was tormented not only by sexual frustration, but by moral qualms about his “sinful” erotic imagination as well.72 In a different way, the same can be said about Petrarch’s contemporary Boccaccio (1313–1375). Known, of course, for his erotic masterpiece Decamerone, in the early 1360s he experienced a crisis of faith after which he not only devoted himself to spiritual pursuits, but also turned into an extreme misogynist.73 Again we encounter the confl ict between sensuality and spirituality as basic to medieval concepts of love.While these traditions are all of great importance to Giordano Bruno’s masterpiece De gli eroici furori, for Ficino their role seems to have been quite minor. It was only in the wake of De Amore that a confl uence 71 Petrarch, Canzoniere, 22 (Con lei foss’io da che si parte il sole, / et non ci vedess’altri che le stelle, / sol una nocte, et mai non fosse l’alba; / et non se transformasse in verde selva / per uscirmi di braccia, come il giorno / ch’Apollo la seguia qua giú per terra).

As soon as it learned to walk by itself, and escaped from Ficino’s “Academy”, it marched faster and faster toward unifi cation with sodomitical behavior.74 But, before merging with the concept of “sodomy”, it gave birth to a heterosexual form of “Pla-tonic love”, that was par excellence the dominant style of courtly love in the Cinquecento.75All specialists agree in assigning to Cardinal Pietro Bembo (1470–1547) a central role in this transformation, which eventually led to a veritable cult of the “religion of beauty in woman.”76 Described by one author as “the great prototype of the courtly Neoplatonic treatise,”77 his Gli Asolani (1505) presents Ficino’s theories in an unambiguously hetero-sexual framework that abounds in Dantean, Petrarchan, and Boccaccian elements. Almost contemporary with Bembo’s text, Leone Ebreo (ca. 1465–15?) wrote his remarkably popular Dialoghi d’Amore (ca. 1502), again heavily based upon Ficino but focused on female beauty. A third central text, the Cortegiano of Baldassare Castiglione (1478–1529), was written about a decade later (publ. in 1528). It exalts the chaste love of mature men for beautiful women, in a manner that makes it a model case of “Platonic love,” including all its stereotypes. As with Ficino, love is based upon sight and hearing: the lover is admonished to enjoy with his eyes the radiance, the grace, the loving ardour, the smiles, the mannerisms and all the other agreeable adornments of the woman he loves [and to] use his hearing to enjoy the sweetness of her voice, the modulation of her words and, if she is a musician, the music she plays.7874 Robb (Neoplatonism of the Italian Renaissance, 181) discusses “heroic friendships” such as those between Ficino and Cavalcanti, and comments “Unfortunately, in the society that surrounded them, the most shameful depravity came sometimes to be qualifi ed as ‘amor socratico.’ ” Dall’Orto (“ ‘Socratic Love,’ ” 59) reminds us that Voltaire in his Dictionnaire philosophique (1764) discussed sex among men under the heading “amour nommé socratique.”75 Dall’Orto, “ ‘Socratic Love,’ ” 59.76 Fletcher, The Religion of Beauty in Woman.77 Robb, Neoplatonism of the Italian Renaissance, 184.78 Castiglione, Il libro del cortegiano (ed.

Love is something of the soul, and must never be confused with sexual desire.Bruno’s Heroic FrenziesWhile Ficino’s De Amore was a highly original and profound work, the same could hardly be said about most of the Italian trattati d’amore that followed in its wake. Specialists agree that most of them are purely conventional and derivative and deplore the “horrible didacticism” that crept into them, particularly due to the moralizing infl uences of the Counter-Reformation.80 It is only with Bruno’s De gli eroici furori that, a century after Ficino, the genre produced another work of genius.81We have seen that the foundational text of Renaissance love literature was written by a man who was addressing other men and in whose life and thought women seem to have been virtually non-existent. Most of his successors, in contrast, were inspired by courtly and Petrarchan traditions and applied his theories to women, whose physical and moral beauty was exalted by them as a refl ection of the divine. From the very fi rst lines of his treatise on love, Bruno distances himself from both perspectives by taking a position that is clearly heterosexual but also shockingly misogynist. Not only Petrarch and his successors, but virtually all representatives of love literature, and last but not least 79 Castiglione, Cortigiano (ed. Cian), 424, as quoted in Robb, Neoplatonism of the Italian Renaissance, 207.80 Robb, Neoplatonism of the Italian Renaissance, 180.81 Bruno’s Eroici furori is readily available in various modern Italian editions.

Never, he says, would the desire enter his mind “to castrate myself or become a eunuch”, and he does not want to be second to anyone “who worthily breaks bread in the service of nature and the blessed God.” In other words, neither is there anything wrong with sexual intercourse, “nor do I believe myself to be frigid, for I do not think that the snows of Mt. Caucusus or Ripheus 82 Bruno, Eroici Furori, Introduction."},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":" under the mantle of love 199would suffi ce to cool my heat.” Bruno simply means to say that “what belongs to Caesar should be rendered unto Caesar, and what belongs to God should be rendered unto God.” In other words, one may appreciate the minor virtues that women possess by nature (and without which, Bruno adds, they would be more useless than a poisonous toadstool); but they should certainly not be made into an object of worship and treated as if they are divine.83Clearly, then, the Eroici Furori is not a conventional love treatise. It neither develops a philosophical metaphysics of love (as in the case of Ficino), nor does it use such a framework for exalting objects of beauty (i.e. the female body). Bruno’s concern is, rather, with what would nowadays be called the psychology of love. His goal is to uncover the real nature of the “frenzies” or “madnesses” ( furores) by which male lovers are tormented and which seem to render them irrational and out of control. The true lover is not foolishly tormented by a passion for a woman, but by a “heroic” passion for the divine. Bruno’s usage of the word “heroic” here is extremely interesting and signifi cant, for it refl ects not only Ficino’s association of “hero” with “eros” (see above), but also refers to a medical/psychological condition traditionally known as amor hereos:84 the love-sickness or love-madness whose symptoms Bruno describes in the fi rst lines of the Eroici Furori, quoted above. We have seen that Bruno pours scorn on those who allow something so insignifi cant as a woman to get them into such a condition. But as we are about to see, the sufferings and torments of the “heroic lover” are appropriate and indeed inevitable if caused by the only true and worthy object of desire. To confuse them with the frenzies of physical love would be as 83 All these quotations occur in Bruno, Eroici Furori, Introduction, which also states that a living woman is considered hardly “worthy of being loved naturally even in that instant when her beauty is in fl ower.” While women in general are treated with the utmost contempt, Bruno quite hypocritically makes an exception for “those ladies who have been worthily praised and who are praiseworthy: and those, especially, who may and do reside in this British land, to whom we owe the love and fi delity of the guest.” The English women, and Queen Elizabeth most of all, “are not females, they are not women but, in the guise of women, they are nymphs, they are goddesses and of celestial substance.” At the end of his introduction Bruno even appends a poem addressed to these “most glorious and virtuous ladies” of England, which repeats that they are not women but nymphs and goddesses. Bruno abhors only “the ordinary genus”; and he is sure that any “chaste and honest” woman will agree with him that venereal love between men and women is a dishonorable thing.84 See the fascinating article on the philological backgrounds and historical develop-ment of the term “heroes,” by Lowes, “The Loveres Maladye of Hereos.”"},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":"200 wouter j. hanegraaffbizarre, Bruno writes, as seeing “dolphins . . . in the trees of the forest, or wild boars beneath the sea cliffs.”85Apart from the introductory Argument, the Eroici Furori consists of two main parts, each of them consisting of fi ve dialogues. This subdivision, however, is artifi cial and misleading, for actually the ten chapters of the work naturally fall into three parts: chapters 1–4 contain the basic argument in the form of commentaries on a series of sonnets, chap-ters 5–7 consist of a long series of commentaries on emblems (which, unfortunately, were never printed with the text) and their accompanying devices, and chapters 8–10 are three “allegorical fi ctions” in the form of a dialogue between the eyes and the heart, a story of nine blind men, and fi nally a conversation between two women who speak about the fi nal fate of those blind men.Bruno’s text is an extraordinary mixture of esoteric, mystical, and philosophical, but also poetic and artistic elements. From a variety of different perspectives, the text consistently emphasizes the hopeless suffering and torment of the heroic soul, whose metaphysical thirst can only be quenched by attaining the one “object,” “beauty,” or “fi re” of the divinity itself,86 which however seems to remain forever out of reach as long as he lives in this world of the senses. Of central importance in Bruno’s symbolic universe is the “cruel and beautiful” goddess Diana, for she is responsible for the “sweet pain” of the lover, who is forever driven on by the passion—in the double sense of the word—of his never-satisfi ed love: “although the soul does not attain the end desired and is consumed by so much zeal, it is enough that it burns in so noble a fi re.”87 Again and again, one is struck by passages 85 Note that Bruno originally planned to call his book Canticle, in reference to the Song of Songs, which likewise “under the guise of lovers and ordinary passions con-tains similarly divine and heroic frenzies” (for the importance of the Song of Songs to Bruno, see Tirinnanzi, “Il Cantico dei Cantici tra il De umbris Idearum e gli Eroici Furori”). Bruno emphasizes the allegorical and metaphorical nature of both the Song of Songs and his own Eroici Furori, but his admission that some readers will suspect the latter to have a more mundane autobiographical background (i.e., that the work was born out of its author’s rejection by a lover, and had only afterwards “borrowed wings for itself and become heroic”) indicates that he is aware that the former could be so interpreted as well. That Bruno’s work did have its origin in an unhappy romance was argued in 1920 by Antonio Sarno (“La genesi degli ‘Eroici Furori’ ”). For an excellent analysis of the Song of Songs as steamy erotic literature, see Walsh, Exquisite Desire.86 Bruno, Eroici Furori I:1 (“un oggetto . . . una beltà sola . . . un sol fuoco”).87 Bruno, Eroici Furori I:3 (lit.: “that it is so nobly aflame” [ch sia sì nobil-ment’accesa])."},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":" under the mantle of love 201about burning that almost read like predictions of Bruno’s “heroic” death by burning, in 1600.88In the present context it is important to emphasize first of all that— his misogynism notwithstanding—Bruno’s mystical eroticism is unquestionably heterosexual. While God himself remains a dark an inaccessible mystery, all his manifestations are female: most notable here are not only the goddess Diana, but also the sorceress Circe and the English “nymphs” headed by Queen Elizabeth, who dominate the fi nal part of the Eroici Furori. More specifi cally, from a modern perspective we would have to speak of a sadomasochistic eroticism, as shown by frequent statements such as this one: “Why do you fi x your gaze upon an object whose contemplation consumes you? Why are you so smit-ten by that fl ame? Because this torment contents me more than any other pleasure.”89 Bruno’s attitude towards sex is extremely ambiguous. One the one hand, sexual frustration as such seems—in line with the courtly ideal—to be a central dimension of “heroic suffering,” even to such an extent that one might describe it as a necessary mystical “technique.” On the other hand, the ascent from the pursuit of earthly beauty to divine truth is—in line with the Platonic concept—possible only by means of contemplating the earthly beauty of the (female) body; and Bruno repeatedly hints that this spiritual ideal is compatible with sexual activity:Alas, he will say, if a shadowy, cloudy, elusive beauty painted upon the surface of corporeal matter pleases me so much and so incites my affection . . . so captivates me and so sweetly binds me and draws me to it, that I fi nd my senses offer nothing so agreeable to me, what would be 88 It seems reasonable to speculate (although it can obviously never be proven) that Bruno’s convictions about heroic love may have played a signifi cant role in his deci-sion not to revoke his heresies, and thus suffer the consequences of death at the stake. For someone who believed as passionately as Bruno did in this doctrine of mystical “love-death,” which can only be attained by pursuing a path of heroic suffering to the very end, giving in to the fear of death would mean a fatal betrayal of the very core beliefs to which he had devoted his life: for isn’t it only in death itself that the mystical goal can be attained? And for someone who believed as deeply as Bruno did in the truth of symbols as corresponding to divine realities, being consumed by fi re would be the only logical end for a person, who had lived his life “burning with passion” for the divine mystery. Chilling though such speculation may be, I believe that if one takes Bruno seriously, one has to concede that in the fi nal years before his execution he cannot possibly have overlooked the remarkable “match” between his theory of mystical death and the reality of the death that awaited him.89 Bruno, Eroici Furori II:1 (second emblem)."},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":"202 wouter j. hanegraaffthe effect upon me of that which is the substantial, original, and primal beauty? . . . Therefore, the contemplation of this vestige of light must lead me by the purgation of my soul to an imitation, a conformity, and participation in that most worthy and most lofty light into which I am transformed and with which I am united. For I am sure that nature, having put this [corporeal] beauty before my eyes . . . wishes that from here below I become elevated . . . Nor do I believe that my true divinity, inasmuch as it is shown to me in its vestige and image, would be offended if I happened to honor it in its vestige and image and to offer sacrifi ces to it, provided that the impulse of my heart remained ordered and my affection remained intent upon what is higher.90It is hard not to read such “sacrifi ces” offered to a woman as the vestige and image of the divine and the “honor” done to her as coded refer-ences to sexual practice. Bruno leaves his reader in no doubt that he is greatly “pleased,” “incited to affection,” “captivated,” “sweetly bound,” and “drawn” by female beauty, and that in this world there is nothing more “agreeable to the senses”; and he convinces himself that giving in to the lure of that beauty is no sin, as long as it does not throw the “impulse of his heart” into disorder and his true affection remains focused not on the woman in question but upon her transcendent archetype. In short, he may make love to the woman as long as he does not fall in love with her.Central to Bruno’s text is the myth of Actaeon, the hunter who in the depths of the woods chances upon the naked goddess Diana while she is taking her bath. While he gazes upon her beauty, his own dogs turn against him and devour him: the hunter becomes prey and the prey becomes hunter. Bruno impressively explains the myth as an alle-gory for the “love-death” of the heroic lover: he is killed by his own passions but in his very death he is transformed into the object of his desire. Diana is the shadow of the inaccessible and wholly mysterious God: she is “the world, the universe, the nature which is in things, the light shining through the obscurity of matter.”91 In an amazing passage—reminiscent of modern neopagan and neo-shamanic nature-mysticism—Bruno describes how Actaeon, the prototype of the heroic lover, has moved beyond this world and yet remains in it:90 Bruno, Eroici Furori II:1 (second emblem).91 Bruno, Eroici Furori II:2 (thirteenth emblem)."},{"pageNumber":226,"pageContent":" under the mantle of love 203From the vulgar, ordinary, civil, and common man he was, he becomes as free92 as a deer, and an inhabitant of the wilderness; he lives like a god beneath the towering forest, in the natural93 rooms of the cavernous mountains, where he contemplates the sources of the great rivers, vigor-ous as a plant, intact and pure, free of ordinary lusts, and converses most freely with the divinity, to which so many men have aspired, who in their desire to taste the celestial life on earth have cried with one voice: “Lo, I have gone far off fl ying away; and I remained in the wilderness.”94Bruno’s text is dominated by the symbolism of fi re and water, connected with the heart and the eyes. The burning passion of the lover’s heart is increased to ever greater heights by means of the images of beauty that reach him through the eyes; but the eyes are crying all the time, because of the suffering that is caused by the heart’s unsatisfi ed fi ery passion. Hence the “dialogues” between the burning heart and the crying eyes that take up the third dialogue of Part II.Bruno’s fi nal two dialogues are about nine blind men: allegories of the lover who wanders around this earth tormented by his inability to perceive the divine. The lovers have been blinded for nine reasons: by being born blind, by jealousy, by a too sudden exposure to light, by overexposure to light, by too much weeping, by having the body dried up, by having been burned up, by having been blinded by love, and by lack of confi dence and humility of spirit. In the fi nal dialogue we learn how the enchantress Circe has given them a vase of water that she is unable to open herself, but which she says will perhaps be opened one day by one who has “lofty wisdom and noble chastity and beauty together.” If and when that ever happens, the blind men will behold “the two most beautiful stars of the world,” compared to which all other lights pale into insignifi cance, and their long search will be over. After long wanderings the blind men fi nally reach England and meet the “beautiful and gracious nymphs of Father Thames,” but by this time they no longer have any hope left. They have long come to believe that Circe with her prophecy merely intended to increase their torment: “this enchantress, for our greater woe, strives to keep us in eternal expectation. For she believes that no lady of so many accomplishments can be seen beneath the cloak of heaven.” However, the nymphs pass 92 Orig.: “salvatico,” i.e. wild, untamed, undomesticated.93 Orig.: “non artifi ciose,” i.e. non-artifi cial.94 Bruno, Eroici Furori II:2 (thirteenth emblem).

Eros is the desire for a perfect, divine, eternal beauty which can never be satisfi ed in this world; that is why it keeps us forever restless, hungry and thirsty, suspended between hope and despair, like a cruel mistress who promises release but never gives it and perhaps never will. Ficino and Bruno tell us that it is pos-sible for erotic desire to attain its goal, but only at the very limits of this world, for it belong to the very essence of love that it can never be consummated within the domain of the senses, corporeality, and time. Only in the ultimate transcendence of the body and “at the end of desire” is the lover fi nally united with beauty itself. He must pass through suffering and death in order to enter a domain where eternal beauty resides and nothing remains to be desired, and yet it is desire itself that has caused him to search for that domain in the fi rst place, and has pushed him to the limit of this world. In other words, nothing 95 Bruno, Eroici Furori II:5.96 Elsewhere in the Eroici Furori too, “twin suns” always refer to the eyes."},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":" under the mantle of love 205could be further from Ficino’s and Bruno’s perspectives than a belief that in order to fi nd peace, one must fi rst seek to subjugate the passions and kill desire. On the contrary, although it is true that desire causes suffering, it is also the very force that impels us to climb upwards on the scale of perfection; and according to Bruno it is only in and through the very fi re of passion, which burns and tortures body and soul, that the heroic lover may hope to attain the “end of desire.”BibliographyAllen, Michael J.B., Marsilio Ficino: The Philebus Commentary.

PrincipeSexual and erotic language and imagery is extremely common in alchemy. Its most visible form occurs in oft-reproduced alchemical emblemata that routinely contain graphic depictions of gendered enti-ties and copulating couples. Alchemical texts regularly employ erotic language as well, often describing extended allegorical sequences that occasionally involve sexual intercourse of various kinds or at least employ highly gendered imagery. Even at the most basic level, alche-mists frequently speak of their substances as gendered—some as female, some as male, and some, rather famously, as hermaphroditic. Among modern commentators, the presence of such imagery has engendered a variety of explanations—of divergent plausibility and historical sen-sibility—for its origin, purpose, and meaning. This chapter addresses fundamental questions about such imagery: What do these erotic or gendered images really mean? What purposes do they serve in texts? How and why are they constructed by their authors? Why should gen-dered and sexual language and images be so widespread in alchemy? And how integral in fact is sexual language and thought to alchemical aims and practices?The wide diversity of writers, practices, aims, theories, and cultural contexts present in the long history of alchemy means that exhaustive answers to these questions would extend far beyond the bounds of this chapter. Nonetheless, if we limit ourselves to the epoch of alchemy for which suffi cient textual resources for broad scholarship currently exist—namely, the Latin West from the Middle Ages to the eighteenth century—then an examination of some representative sources and their contexts should provide at least an outline of answers. A contextual-ized examination of these sources promises to correct various facile misconceptions that remain widespread. Indeed, while the subject of sexuality in alchemy has long been a subject of study, much of the writing on this topic—as is the case for alchemical imagery more gen-erally—gives unnecessarily contrived readings or attempts to explain"},{"pageNumber":233,"pageContent":"210 lawrence m. principeobscura per obscuriorem. In contrast, this chapter strives to present more historically contextualized and more plausible origins and roles for the gendered and sexual language of alchemy.It seems useful to begin with a short inventory of some of the sexual themes found in alchemical imagery and the various forms in which this imagery occurs. The most striking examples are those cast into pictorial form, whether printed engravings and woodcuts or manuscript drawings and illuminations. Such images fi rst appeared in the context of alchemy in the fourteenth century; by the seventeenth century, entire books of such illustrations were being produced.1 In some cases, as in the 1599 Von den grossen Stein der uhralten Weisen (better known as the Twelve Keys) of “Basil Valentine,” the emblems were clearly subordinate to the written text. This secondary status is witnessed by the much greater amount of space accorded to text, and by the fact that the emblems appeared for the fi rst time only in the 1602 second edition of the work.2 In others, like Lambspringk’s De lapide philosophorum, the emblems carry a much greater proportion of the message of the book, being accompanied only by short texts in verse. As an extreme case, the famous Mutus liber contains a long series of pictorial engravings and only a single line of text urging the reader to “pray, read, read, and reread the work and you will fi nd it.”3 There are also collections of emblems with the character of fl orilegia, where elements of the imagery—and in some cases, entire emblems—can be traced to multiple earlier sources. A well-known example is the 1617 Atalanta fugiens of Michael Maier with its fi fty beautiful copperplate emblems.4 But a more extreme example is the Chymisches Lustgärtlein and Johann Daniel Mylius’ Philosophia refor-mata, both of which amass and co-opt a wide miscellany of emblems from quite diverse (and often easily identifi able) sources.5 Thus there exists a range of deployments for alchemical emblems, placing greater or lesser reliance on pictorial representation, showing greater or lesser originality and coherence, and directed to a variety of purposes and audiences.1 See in particular Obrist, Les débuts de l’imagerie alchimique.2 Basil Valentine, Von den grossen Stein der uhralten Weisen. On Valentine see Priesner, “Johann Thoelde und die Schriften des Basilius Valentinus,” and on contemporane-ous interpretations of his emblems see Principe, “Apparatus and Reproducibility in Alchemy,” esp. 59–62.3 Lambspringk, De lapide philosophorum; Mutus liber.4 Maier, Atalanta fugiens; for an analysis of the origins of elements of the emblems, see de Jong, Michael Maier’s Atalanta fugiens.5 Stoltzius von Stoltzenberg, Chymisches Lustgärtlein; Mylius, Philosophia reformata."},{"pageNumber":234,"pageContent":"  revealing  analogies  211Purely textual sources can also employ a highly imaged language, describing in words what the pictures display in visual format. Indeed, the pictorial formats of alchemy are, in general, derived from earlier purely textual sources. For example, the beautiful so-called “Ripley Scrolls” draw at least some of their images from the earlier writings of the authentic fi fteenth century alchemical author George Ripley.6 Written sources can use imagery in various ways—the very simplest (and oldest) being the widely prevalent deployment of Decknamen (cover names) for chemical substances or operations, such as eagle, dragon, or lion, or, to provide examples more germane to the present discus-sion, red man, white wife, and hermaphrodite—to encode alchemical texts, investing them with the secrecy inseparable from so much of alchemy. Such usages date to some of the earliest chrysopoetic texts, notably the Late Classical writings of Zosimus.7 It is worth pointing out however, that the early productions of Latin alchemy, such as the thirteenth-century Summa perfectionis of Geber, are free of such disguised names. These Decknamen are frequently woven into extended allegories or parables that recount the (often bizarre) transactions of a host of creatures. Sometimes these conceits are written and labelled explicitly as “parabolae;” sometimes they are cast as dream sequences, or as travels to exotic locales, and so forth. By far the most common of the specifi cally sexual images is the con-jugal pair, depicted either as merely being joined in marriage (Figure 1), or more graphically in the act of procreation (Figure 2). The language of male and female and of sexual generation is pervasive in alchemical texts. Another common image is that of the hermaphrodite, frequently depicted not merely with anomalous pelvic anatomy but often as bicephalous or bicorporal (Figure 3).Other sexual oddities also appear in alchemical contexts, and Greek mythology provided a locus classicus for almost any imaginable combina-tion of sexes and number of participants leading to generation. For example, Orion is considered to have had three fathers and no mother, and this myth is adapted to alchemical purposes in one emblem of 6 On the Ripley Scrolls see Linden, “The Ripley Scrolls and The Compound of Alchymy.”7 For Decknamen in Zosimus, see Zosimus, Mémoires autenthiques; in Islamic alchemy, see Ruska and Wiedemann, “Alchemistische Decknamen,” and Siggel, Decknamen in der arabischen alchemistischen Literatur."},{"pageNumber":235,"pageContent":"212 lawrence m. principeFig. 1.

The mature Orion—who will emerge as an infant from the bull’s hide in due course—is depicted on the far right.

I propose that the use of sexual imagery in alchemy results, paradoxically, from two opposing desires on the part of its creators: the desire to explain and the desire to conceal. In the balance of this chapter I shall present evidence from various sources to show (1) that alchemical writers consciously created their terms and images with both of these goals Fig. 3.

Thus they had to develop theories of matter and change, that is to say, expositions of processes which by defi nition occurred fundamentally below the level of direct sense perception and thus of direct experience. Alchemists of the Middle Ages and early modern period dealt with these issues using a language of minimae par-tes, substantial forms, corpuscles, or other theoretical constructs, drawn from Aristotelian and other natural philosophical traditions.8 Given any subject whose explanatory principles lie outside of direct sense perception, it is natural—indeed unavoidable—to turn to analogy for explanation and clarifi cation, that is, to explain the unknown by means of the known, the unfamiliar by means of the familiar. Scientists today are familiar with this technique, even if they are not always as aware as they might be of the degree of implicitly metaphorical usage in their daily thought and work.9 It is no more than a truism to note that in creating descriptive analogical language, one draws most helpfully and most readily upon common experience. And there is hardly a more common human experience than that of gender and sexuality.Higher animals, including human beings, are most obviously divided into two groups on the basis of biological sex. Thus the binary of male/female provides an ever-ready means of labeling or classifying anything that falls into two subcategories (and sometimes three, with the inclusion of neuter). Such a scheme is most obvious in languages where grammarians chose to classify nouns by “gender.”10 Minerals as well have been classifi ed as male and female; for example, stibnite, an antimony ore, was once classifi ed by miners as male-antimony and female-antimony depending on whether or not it displayed golden 8 On the matter theories used and developed by chrysopoetic alchemists, see New-man, “Experimental Corpuscular Theory”; Gehennical Fire, 151–164 and 228–239; and Principe, “Diversity in Alchemy,” 181–200. 9 For example, every structural chemical formula is essentially analogical—a rep-resentation distant from the reality of the subject but nonetheless tightly linked to it by means of conventions. Pedagogically it is nearly impossible to speak of chemical explanations without the constant recourse to similes.10 In passing I shall point out that it seems predominantly anglophones, whose lan-guage has almost no vestiges of grammatical gender, who tend to confect extravagant notions regarding gender and language owing to their failure to realize that the “gender” of nouns in other languages is merely a classifi cation system of grammarians rather than a system of gendered values: a completely unlettered Frenchman never fails to say la maison blanche and le vin blanc without ever knowing that grammarians classify the former as feminine and the latter as masculine. On related issues in terms of nature, see Osler, “The Gender of Nature and the Nature of Gender.”"},{"pageNumber":239,"pageContent":"216 lawrence m. principeveins.11 Some folk knowledge routinely classifi es many non-gendered objects such as fruits, vegetables, and plants into male and female.12 In each case, the application of a “gender” facilitates description and differentiation between sub-types.Alchemists likewise divided metals into groups of male and female, and did so by drawing upon various sources, particularly astrological and mythological correspondences. Thus they tended to consider gold, mercury, iron, tin, and lead as masculine, since these metals are rep-resented respectively by the gods/planets the Sun (Apollo), Mercury, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn. Silver and copper on the other hand are named as female, since they are connected to goddesses: the Moon (Diana) and Venus.The connection to generation or procreation is a central facet of sexual images. This is particularly important in alchemy, since so much of its effort is directed towards the production of new substances and the explanation of their origins. Indeed, the production of alchemical precious metals was often described as a multiplication or propaga-tion—a small quantity of gold or silver could be “multiplied” into a larger quantity by the successful alchemist. Thus, once the metals were theorized to arise from the combination of two primordial constituents, called Mercury and Sulphur, it was easy enough to represent this binary by the male/female binary, and then to represent their combination to form metals as a “procreation.”13 Which constituent received which gender fl owed naturally from an alignment with other important, well-entrenched Aristotelian and Hippocratic dualities. That is, since Sulphur was considered in the context of alchemy as the carrier of the qualities of dry and hot (think of the burning of brimstone), it was therefore the male by analogy with animals, where males are hot and dry. Since Mercury was considered the carrier of wet and cold (think of the cold feel of liquid mercury in the hands), it was considered female by the same process. The observable experimental fact—well-known 11 See Boerhaave, New Method of Chemistry, 302.12 Anecdotally, I recall my Southern Italian grandmother explaining to me how to tell a male eggplant from a female one based on the shape of the blossom scar, and also an argument between her and my father as to whether chicories that bolted in their fi rst year were male or female (my father maintained they were femminile because they produced seeds, my grandmother claimed maschile because of their erect shape).13 The development of the Mercury-Sulphur theory of the metals dates to the Islamic period and is connected particularly to the Jabirian corpus of the ninth to tenth cen-turies; it draws its ultimate origins from Aristotle’s Meteorologica III (378a18–378b4)."},{"pageNumber":240,"pageContent":"  revealing  analogies  217by the Islamic Middle Ages—that common sulphur coagulates liquid mercury into solid cinnabar, was transferred by analogy to the natural production of metals, where Sulphur coagulates Mercury into a metal. This idea further rigorizes the male/female label for Sulphur/Mercury, since it parallels Classical medical ideas of the coagulation of female menstrual blood by male semen into a fetus.The point to be made at this juncture is that the attachment of gender to alchemical laboratory substances served at one level as a further means of describing their inherent qualities (hot, cold, etc.) or their mutual reactivities by a process of analogy. Such a system was, of course, prone to both complication and ambiguity as classifi cations based on partly overlapping systems and analogies interacted. For example, one (presumably) unintentional consequence of the overlap of the various classifi cation systems within alchemy was that mercury could be female in some contexts (e.g., in relation to sulphur) and male in others (in relation to copper and silver). These potential ambigui-ties were not a drawback for alchemical purposes, but were in fact an asset given the specifi c needs of alchemical writers—particularly, the need for secrecy.Alchemists, unlike most modern chemists, were subject to a powerful need for secrecy. The desire to keep the specifi cs of alchemical knowl-edge secret has several roots. One of the most basic is the pre-modern notion that the highest types of knowledge—to which class alchemists considered theirs to belong—are not to be divulged freely to the unini-tiated or the unworthy. This idea was exemplifi ed by accounts of the ancient Pythagoreans and recapitulated in alchemical contexts by the widespread assertion that the Philosophers’ Stone—the eagerly sought material agent of metallic transmutation—was so diffi cult to prepare that success was to be considered a donum Dei, a particular grace from the Almighty. But in addition, one should not underestimate more mundane legal and economic pressures. By the fourteenth century, laws forbidding transmutation began to be put in place, largely out of concern about the debasement of coinage and the protection of the value of the precious metals upon which economic systems were based. The fear was that a successful but unscrupulous alchemist could easily upset the stability of society.14 Alchemical knowledge was potentially as dangerous then as 14 “For this Science must ever secret be/The Cause whereof is his as ye may see/If one evill man had hereof all his will/All Christian Pease he might hastilie spill,/and"},{"pageNumber":241,"pageContent":"218 lawrence m. principethe knowledge of nuclear weapons is today. Thus, while metaphorical and gendered language was useful for explaining, conceptualizing, and classifying, it could be equally useful for concealing.By drawing on an ever-expanding web of transumptive relationships, alchemical writers could disguise the identities of chemical substances with a host of Decknamen. Thus animals, plants, and people could “stand in” metaphorically for substances, and by simple extension the mutual reactions of those chemical substances could be represented by transactions between animate beings, which of course includes sexual intercourse. Dissolution could be envisioned as one creature devouring another, and two substances of different qualities combining to produce a third could be seen as parents producing offspring.A key question is to what extent the alchemists were consciously aware of where the literal and the metaphorical met. To what extent did alchemists think that their descriptors—including those of male-female, of biological procreation and copulation—were literally true? This is an important point for understanding the mental processes of the alche-mists, and it bears upon some commonly-held views of alchemy.The most widely disseminated interpretation of alchemical imagery in general, and of its sexual images in particular, originated in the writings of Herbert Silberer but was developed more extensively by Carl Gustav Jung. Jung claimed that alchemy deals not primarily with material substances but rather with psychic states of the practitioner, and that alchemical imagery is a manifestation of a supposed “collec-tive unconscious” populated by “archetypal images.” Such views were echoed through the twentieth century by a dynasty of acolytes and devotees. This interpretation depends upon the supposedly unconscious nature of alchemical imagery. Another view, propounded by the histo-rian of religions Mircea Eliade, takes alchemical imagery quite literally, reading from it an expression of an animistic, organic, “primitive” world-view where inorganic substances like metals do actually live, grow, and reproduce.The unsound foundations of these interpretations have been revealed at length elsewhere.15 Jungian views, based ultimately on Victorian with his Pride he might pull downe/Rightfull Kings and Princes of renowne:” Norton, Ordinall of Alchimy, 14.15 Principe and Newman, “Some Problems with the Historiography of Alchemy”; Obrist, Débuts, esp. 11–21 and 33–36; Merkur, “Methodology and the Study of Western Spiritual Alchemy,” 53–70."},{"pageNumber":242,"pageContent":"  revealing  analogies  219occultism, have proven especially pernicious. For those following his models, alchemical imagery has provided little more than a stage upon which to strut their own psychoanalytic constructions, thereby adding further obfuscation to an already diffi cult issue and pushing a solid historical understanding of alchemy further from our grasp. Now let us turn to a closer analysis of alchemical sexual imagery to see what Medieval and early-modern alchemists themselves thought about it.The famous image of the hermaphrodite provides an illuminating starting point. Figure 3 shows a bicephalous hermaphrodite, pointed out to the viewer by St. Albert the Great. What is the connection to the doctor universalis? As it turns out, St. Albert was one of the fi rst to deploy the language of hermaphrodites in an alchemical context, specifi cally when speaking of the formation of metals. Most helpfully, the Universal Doctor actually explains why he is using the term and also makes highly revealing comments about gendered terminology in alchemy. Albert fi rst recounts the Mercury-Sulphur theory of metallic composition, and says that these constituents of metals arelike father and mother, as alchemical authors say speaking metaphorically. For sulphur is like the father and mercury like the mother, although it is more aptly to be expressed that the sulphur in the commixture of met-als is like the substance of the paternal seed, and the mercury like the menstrual blood which is coagulated into the substance of embryos.16Albert here notes explicitly that alchemical authors speak “metaphori-cally” [metaphorice] and immediately strips down some of the metaphor by replacing the sentient agencies of father and mother with the specifi c material substances that directly produce the offspring. When Albert describes the properties of sulphur, he notes that “it is to be observed that some hot-dry is joined to a wet-cold in the same complexion, and this complexion is hermaphroditic.”17 Thus for Albert the term her-maphroditic merely expresses a mixed nature where the “male” com-plexion of hot-dry coexists with the “female” complexion of wet-cold; 16 Albert the Great, Mineralia, bk. 4, c. 1; in Opera omnia, 5:83: “tangemus primo de his quae quasi universalia metallorum sunt sicut pater et mater, sicut dicunt metaphorice loquentes auctores alchimiae: sulphur enim est quasi pater, et argentum vivum mater : quod convenientius dicitur si sulphur dicatur esse in commixtione metallorum quasi substantia seminis paterni, et argentum vivum sicut menstruum quod coagulatur in substantiam embryonum.”17 Ibid., 84: “Sed observandum est quoddam calidum siccum esse conjunctum humido frigido in eadem complexione, et haec complexio est hermaphrodita.” Obrist traces the origin of this usage to the pseudo-Aristotelian De plantis (817a30), see Débuts, 158."},{"pageNumber":243,"pageContent":"220 lawrence m. principewhat might be interpreted as a bizarre term redolent of sex is actually quite pedestrian. Indeed, Albert elsewhere clearly notes that the names for matter can be either proper—e.g., hyle, origo, massa—or transump-tive—e.g. sylva, mater, femina—and he laments the fact that because there do not exist “proper terms” for talking specifi cally about the generation and virtues of material substances (particularly minerals), we have no choice but to discuss them “per similia.”18Such a clear acknowledgement of the metaphorical nature of names and terms in alchemy is by no means restricted to St. Albert. Petrus Bonus, whose massive alchemical work Margarita preciosa novella, written about 1330 and incorporating an extensive use of Decknamen, echoes Albert’s ideas. Similarly, the Scholastic chrysopoeian of the late sixteenth century, Gaston Duclo, is at pains to emphasize that descriptions of alchemical processes use the language of male and female, of seeds, of agriculture and animal husbandry purely “metaphoricè,” and are not to be taken to mean that the metals have either life or sexuality.19A stunning example of how gendered Decknamen were consciously and carefully constructed by alchemical writers in order to “conceal and reveal” is provided by George Starkey (1628–1665). Starkey, born in Bermuda and educated at a young Harvard College (he earned the degree of A.B. in 1646), began the study of chymistry and chemical medicine while in New England. After relocating to London in late 1650, he became a friend and informal chymistry tutor of Robert Boyle (1627–1691) and a member of the circle gathered around the intelligencer Samuel Hartlib. Starkey told this circle of an alchemi-cal adept in New England who possessed both the red and white Philosophers’ Stones (i.e. for turning base metals into gold and silver, respectively) and who had shown him transmutation. This anonymous adept, known only by the name Eirenaeus Philalethes (“Peaceful Lover of Truth”), had written several treatises on making the Stone that he entrusted to the young Starkey in order to help guide him to the suc-cessful preparation of the transmuting Stones. Starkey shared some of these writings with the eager Hartlibians. We now know that Starkey was himself the author of these “Philalethes” treatises, even though the Hartlibians—including Starkey’s close friend Boyle—never realized 18 Albert, Physica, bk. 1, tr. 3, c. 12; Opera, 3:72; Mineralia, bk. I, tr. 1, ch. 5, “quia propria nomina hujus virtutis non habemus, ideo per similia oportet declarare quae sit illa virtus.” See also Obrist, Débuts, 31–33.19 Principe, “Diversity in Alchemy.”"},{"pageNumber":244,"pageContent":"  revealing  analogies  221the truth.20 The Philalethes manuscripts, published after Starkey’s early death, became some of the most infl uential and widely-read chrysopo-etic treatises of the seventeenth century, and, owing to their lavish use of extravagant imagery, provided fundamental sources for Jung and other twentieth-century interpreters of alchemy.During Starkey’s years in London he was a busy experimentalist, and he kept meticulous notebooks of his laboratory operations.21 Recently, a long-lost Starkey notebook was discovered in the archives of the Royal Society of London.22 This notebook contains previously unknown chymical treatises akin to those that comprise the Philalethes corpus. Excitingly, the three treatises it contains were left in various stages of completion, allowing the historian to witness their process of composi-tion. For our present purposes, the insight they provide on the choice of sexually-charged Decknamen is particularly valuable.Starkey left the second of the three treatises, entitled Clavis totius scientiae (Key to the Whole Science) and dated 1656, in a rough state; in fact, there are so many insertions, deletions, and rewritings that the text is sometimes diffi cult to read.23 The tract deals with the fi rst cru-cial part of making the Philosophers’ Stone, namely, the preparation of the philosophical mercury, a prized secret that is allusively encoded throughout the published Philalethes corpus. The key to this process is to fi nd the proper “medium” which, once joined with common mercury, will transform that common mercury into a “Philosophical Mercury” allowing it to combine inseparably with gold. The combined philosophi-cal mercury and gold can then be heated in a sealed fl ask for a long period of time, eventually producing the Philosophers’ Stone.24Revealingly, the manuscript of Clavis totius scientiae contains a set of coherent alterations to the text that clearly display both the evolution of Starkey’s chymical thought and how his Decknamen had to respond to these changes. At fi rst, Starkey-Philalethes wrote that the philosophical mercury is to be made using our “Hermaphroditic Body [corpus Her-maphroditicum].” The chemical substance covered by this Deckname can 20 On Starkey, see Newman, Gehennical Fire.21 Starkey, Alchemical Laboratory Notebooks and Correspondence; and Newman and Principe, Alchemy Tried in the Fire.22 Principe, “Newly-Discovered Boyle Documents.”23 Photos and transcriptions of the pages described here from Clavis totius scientiae are reproduced in Starkey, Laboratory Notebooks, 225 and 238–245.24 On this process see Principe, Aspiring Adept, 153–55ff.; Newman and Principe, Alchemy Tried in the Fire, 119–28."},{"pageNumber":245,"pageContent":"222 lawrence m. principebe revealed from Starkey’s more plaintext writings in the notebooks as the “martial regulus of antimony.” This Deckname appears not only here in the notebooks but also in the Introitus apertus and other works eventually published under the name of Philalethes.25 The martial regulus of antimony is a form of the semi-metal antimony prepared by the reduction of the native ore stibnite, an antimony sulphide, with metallic iron. In this process, described in great detail in several places in Starkey’s laboratory notebooks, nine parts of the native ore are fused in a crucible with four parts of iron. This operation produces a bright button of metal at the bottom of the crucible; this is the “martial regulus of antimony,” sometimes called the “star-regulus” because of the stellate crystalline pattern that often appears on its surface. It was believed to be a product containing both a part of the iron and the “purer” part of the antimony. Now, given that the metal iron was tra-ditionally linked to the planet Mars, the god of war, it can be thought of by correspondence as a “male” substance. Antimony, on the other hand, because of its “tender” nature—that is, its volatility, reactivity, brittleness, and easy fusion—is traditionally thought of as a “female” substance. Therefore, the regulus of antimony, as a combination of the male iron and the female antimony, can rightly be called a “her-maphroditic body.” Just as the union of antimony and iron provide the martial regulus, so the union of female and male provide a her-maphrodite. Thus we can see that the name is neither arbitrary nor “unconscious” but instead descriptive—it is made both to conceal and to reveal. It conceals the plain-text name of the substance, but reveals something of its nature and origin.But even more illuminating is how Starkey later had to change the Decknamen he employed in the Clavis scientiae as his thoughts about the process developed. These alterations give a “behind the scenes” glimpse of both the decoding and the encoding of alchemical imagery. The same notebook contains an account, written about a month after the Clavis scientiae, of Starkey’s struggles to “decode” a bizarre parable contained within a classic work on chrysopoeia written by the pseudo-Bernard of Trier. This extended allegorical conceit begins with Bernard relaxing after a disputation by taking a walk in the open fi elds. He comes upon 25 The hermaphrodite appears as a Deckname for the martial regulus of antimony in Eirenaeus Philalethes, Introitus apertus ad occlusum regis palatium, 647–99, in Musaeum hermeticum, 658."},{"pageNumber":246,"pageContent":"  revealing  analogies  223a beautiful fountain and meets an old man there who tells him that the fountain’s only use is as a bath for the king, and that it is tended by a porter who warms it for him. Bernard asks the old man many questions about the king and his odd bathing practices and about the nature of the fountain. Eventually Bernard grows sleepy, and accidentally drops a golden book (the prize from his disputation) into the fountain, drains the fountain to retrieve the book, and is thrown into prison. After his release, Bernard returns to the fountain to fi nd it covered in clouds. Bernard concludes by writing that “in this my parable the entire work [of making the Stone] is contained, in practice, days, colors, regimens, methods, managements, and connections.”26Starkey sets about interpreting Bernard’s “parable,” presumably because his laboratory practices were not responding to his expec-tations—i.e., his experiments failed to produce the Philosophers’ Stone—and he needed more guidance from authoritative texts. Starkey notes that the king must certainly be gold, the rex metallorum, and his “bathing” must be the gold’s dissolution in philosophical mercury. Star-key then notes that Bernard says that when the king comes to bathe, he leaves “behind him al his servants (which are the mettalls),” being accompanied only by a porter. Thus it seems here that iron, which Starkey had been using to form the martial regulus—one of the lesser metals and thus one of the king’s servants—must be “left behind,” that is, not used in the process. But Starkey, unsatisfi ed with a single reason, continues interpreting. He examines the porter that accompanies the king to his bath, whom he interprets as the necessary medium between gold and mercury (i.e., the king and his bath) that must be incorpo-rated into the philosophical mercury. This porter is thus, according to Starkey’s previous theory, the martial regulus of antimony. But now Starkey notes that Bernard affi rms “this Porter . . . to be most simple of al things in the world whose offi ce is nothing but day by day to warme the bath (that is by making al fl uid) now if it were compounded it could not be sayd to be so simple, which is uncompounded.” Here Starkey interprets Bernard’s use of the word “simple,” which in the context of the parable means that the porter is unsophisticated or naïve (“homo valde simplex, imo simplicissimus hominum”) to mean compositionally 26 Trevisan, De secretissimo philosophorum opere chemico, in Bibliotheca chemica curiosa, 2:388–399; the parable is on 397–99; “Nam in hac mea parabola totum opus continetur in practica, diebus, coloribus, regiminibus, viis, dispositionibus, & continuationibus . . .”"},{"pageNumber":247,"pageContent":"224 lawrence m. principesimple, that is, uncompounded, implying that pure “simple” antimony regulus should be used, not a martial regulus containing iron. Still not satisfi ed, Starkey seeks more verifi cation. He next notes that Bernard asked the old man whether any of the king’s servants went into the bath with him, and the “answer is returned not one, & if not one,” Starkey concludes, “then not iron.”27 Thus Starkey decides now that he should use a regulus of antimony made without iron (by reducing the ore with salts instead).But once Starkey rejects the addition of iron to the regulus, the Deckname “Hermaphroditical body” is no longer applicable; there is no longer a “male” element present. As a result, Starkey returns to his previously written Clavis totius scientiae and systematically deletes every use of the term corpus hermaphroditicum, replacing each with the symbol for Venus. Venus, although most commonly used in alchemical texts for copper, is now a proper Deckname for the simple regulus made without iron because the regulus without iron would be purely feminine, like the goddess Venus. Looking at it another way, the male “Herm” has been removed from the Hermaphrodite, leaving only Aphrodite, who is, of course, the Greeks’ Venus.Thus Starkey’s notebooks provide compelling evidence for exactly how sexual imagery in alchemy was constructed. The terms are neither arbitrary nor merely picturesque, nor do they manifest a “primitive” vitalistic mentality, nor, needless to say, are they “irruptions of the unconscious.” Instead, they are carefully chosen metaphors, simulta-neously descriptive and deceptive, meant to be interpretable by the adroit. Simply stated, alchemical imagery—sexual and otherwise—was intelligently designed both to conceal and to reveal.Further insight into the use of sexual images in alchemy can be gained if we visit a text lying outside the ambit of traditional transmutational alchemy. This is Otto Tachenius’ Hippocrates chymicus published in 1666, and the companion Clavis of 1669. Tachenius was a German by birth, but after an apprenticeship as an apothecary, he went to Italy where he received a medical degree at Padua in 1652 and fi nally settled in Venice.28 Much of his support came from the sale of a saline medi-cament prepared from snakes, called the sal viperinum. His Hippocrates chymicus takes its rise from a defense of this medicine, and continues 27 Starkey, Notebooks and Correspondence, 251.28 On Tachenius, see Take, Otto Tachenius, 1610–1680; for an older summary, see Partington, A History of Chemistry, II, 291–96."},{"pageNumber":248,"pageContent":"  revealing  analogies  225with the exposition of Tachenius’ chemical theory of acid and alkali. There is nothing here of chrysopoeia (transmutatory alchemy), or of emblemata, or of allusive discourse, or even of any overt secrecy. Nonetheless, Tachenius’ text is full of sexual imagery, much of it similar to that found in texts on the Philosophers’ Stone. Tachenius’ text pro-vides a contemporaneous example of sexual language outside the usual chrysopoetic canon and thus provides a valuable point of comparison. Moreover, given its freedom from intentional secrecy, Tachenius’ Hip-pocrates provides a more straightforward glimpse of the actual role such language was called upon to serve as a means of explication.Tachenius’ chemical theory maintains that everything in the world is composed of acid and alkali. This conception is partly dependent upon the medico-chymical writings of Joan Baptista Van Helmont and would be widely discussed in the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries in both chemical and medical contexts.29 When acid and alkali combine, a salt is formed, and it is their mutual reactivity that explains chemical and physiological phenomena. But Tachenius’ chymical sys-tem, despite its modern sound, is suffused with sexual imagery in many forms. The simplest is the denomination of alkali as female and acid as male. Here again is an example of the use of the obvious male-female duality to illustrate a less obvious natural duality that is productive of new entities by their combination. But the comparison goes further and links Tachenius’ thought to the popular mechanical philosophy of the seventeenth century. For Tachenius tries to prove by experiment that alkalis are “empty and inanous bodies,” or “vacuous and empty,” “and therefore, being impatient of such inanition, [the alkali] desires to be saturated with the Acid into Salt, that it may fulfi ll the course of Nature.”30 He explains further that “if the Alcaly receives, putrefi es and cherishes the Acid . . . it must necessarily perform the offi ce of Mother, and so must be vacuous.”31 This explanation is clearly dependent upon the model of male-female copulation, where the alkali’s empty spaces are likened to a womb, ready to receive the acid, and indeed Tachenius calls this process (that we would call neutralization) an “impregnation.” Likewise, the acids for Tachenius are phallically-shaped bodies able to penetrate the vacuities of the alkalies.3229 On the acid and alkali theory, see Hall, “Acid and Alkali in Seventeenth-century Chemistry,” and Debus, Chemistry and Medical Debate.30 Tachenius, Hippocrates chemicus, 87 and 89; Clavis, 13.31 Tachenius, Clavis, 18.32 Tachenius, Hippocrates, 7."},{"pageNumber":249,"pageContent":"226 lawrence m. principeTachenius’ system resembles—and very possibly forms the crucial source for—the mechanical corpuscularian images popularized for chemistry in the 1670’s by Nicolas Lemery. According to Lemery’s system, alkalis are porous, spongy bodies, and acids hard and pointed; neutralization (formation of a salt) occurs when the acid’s points fi ll the pores of the alkali.33 Thus Tachenius’ denomination of alkali as female includes the obviously sexual notion of a vacuity to be fi lled by the (acidic) male counterpart, leading to the production of a new substance. It bears repeating that this occurs outside the context of secretive chrysopoeia, and thus exemplifi es the use of sexual imagery to explain, clarify, and conceptualize, not to conceal.Tachenius uses sexual imagery in other contexts as well. For example, he states that “Cyprian Vitriol is truly hermaphroditical.”34 What on earth does he mean? He goes on to show by means of analytical tests that this native vitriol from Cyprus contains both iron and copper. Iron, as noted above, is traditionally related to the planet Mars, and thus clearly male, while copper is related to Venus, and thus female. Therefore, a salt containing both iron and copper is “truly hermaph-roditical.” In another place, Tachenius tells of a particular salt brought from Egypt and called Sal-kali (a kind of soda), and he refers to it as a virgin “said by the Ancients to have three fathers”—a lineage remi-niscent of Orion and the Philosophers’ Stone as we saw it depicted in Atalanta fugiens. But here there is no mystery, for once he describes how it is prepared artifi cially by burning a naturally occurring material, he names the three fathers as “nature, fi re, and the philosopher”—i.e., the native source, the processing with fi re, and the know-how of the artisan.35 Interestingly enough, these three fathers of Sal-kali accord-ing to Tachenius are the same as those for the Philosophers’ Stone in Maier—only that the natural starting material is a native salt for one and gold (Apollo) for the other. Thus it is clear that for Tachenius, sexually-charged language is used as a source of further defi nition and more vivid description.The examples presented in this chapter indicate quite clearly that alchemical imagery, including that of a gendered, sexual, or erotic nature, is the careful construction of alchemical authors pressured 33 Nicolas Lemery, Cours de chymie, 14–15.34 Tachenius, Hippocrates, 59.35 Ibid., 7."},{"pageNumber":250,"pageContent":"  revealing  analogies  227by the opposing desires to conceal and to reveal. The complex set of analogies that personifi ed the substances used by alchemists made it easy for them to transfer genders and anthropomorphic activities to the substances reacting in their fl asks and crucibles. Sexually-charged images arise from the familiar and ubiquitous binary of biological sexes, from the commonality of the sexual experience, and from the inherently productive nature of alchemical practice. It is true that some sexual groupings found in alchemical texts lie outside the scope of “mainstream” sexual experiences—for example, incest, menages-à-trois, same-sex couplings, etc. But these sexual groupings are logical outgrowths of the simpler, more “mainstream” sexual imagery. That is, conventional sexual dualities (husband/wife) were expanded by alchemi-cal writers into less conventional forms—hermaphrodites, incest, gender swapping—as they found it necessary to encode/describe the expanding repertoire of material combinations and operations they encountered in their laboratories and their theories.This chapter has been able to present only a small selection of alchemical examples, and therefore it limits itself to making claims about the majority of alchemical writers in the Latin West. But the large number of alchemical writers who declare quite clearly that their language is metaphorical, and that the things signifi ed in sexual terms are actually physical materials and chemical changes leads one to wonder how faulty psychological or psychosexual interpretations of alchemical imagery gained and maintained such currency. One cause becomes obvious if one inspects treatments of alchemy that embrace these misguided interpretations: many display an almost total disconnect between text and image. Decontextualized images appear prominently, but original accompanying texts or accurate summaries of them are often wholly absent. Thus many twentieth-century authors felt quite free to attach their own captions, descriptions, and interpretations of these emblems with little or no regard for the original context or the very words of the original authors. The causes for such negligence are open to debate—ignorance of Latin or other original languages, unwillingness to engage meaningfully with the diffi culty and obscurity of alchemical speech, an ill-conceived dismissal of historical methodol-ogy, and so forth.

CoudertThroughout western history knowledge has been conceived of as a commodity controlled and rationed by those in authority. Kant’s sapere aude (dare to know) would have made no sense if it had not been pre-ceded by centuries of admonitions about the dangers of knowledge and especially of curiosity. A condemnation of curiosity runs like a leitmotif through the medieval and early modern periods, persisting among social, intellectual, and religious conservatives to this very day.1 For example, Roger Shattuck’s relatively recent book Forbidden Knowledge offers a modern version of the very old critique of the impious nature of seeking out the unknown.But while curiosity was condemned, this condemnation was directed more towards women than men. In fact, while a certain amount of curiosity was encouraged and expected in males, it was an anathema in females. When it came to knowledge in general, however, there was more at stake for women than curiosity and the dangers of impiety. If one examines the verbs, nouns, and adjectives connected with the process of acquiring knowledge, their erotic, often violently erotic, connotations are striking. The investigator peers, pierces, and fi nally penetrates to “the heart” of the matter. He dissects, dismembers, dis-mantles, denudes, all with the goal of uncovering, discovering, reveal-ing, laying bare, or unmasking the naked, unvarnished, unveiled, and unalloyed truth.What is equally striking is the gendered nature of this kind of discourse. Inasmuch as activity is associated with males and passiv-ity with females, the one who probes and penetrates is male and the one penetrated is female. In this respect, it is no coincidence that the Latin verb probare means to probe, try, or test as well as to torture. It is the purpose of this chapter to explore the reasons why these ancient, widespread, and gendered associations between knowledge, sex, and 1 Rice, The Renaissance Idea of Wisdom, Chap. 1."},{"pageNumber":255,"pageContent":"232 allison p. coudertviolence became intensifi ed to such a point in early modern Europe and America that a wholly new stereotype emerged of a witch as a sexually insatiable, castrating, phallic female.As Sigrid Brauner and many other scholars have argued, the new witch was invented in the early modern period as the perfect foil for the ideal woman and wife. She spoke and scolded when she should be silent. She was assertive and aggressive when she should be submissive and obedient. She visited and gossiped when she should have stayed at home. But most distressing to male witch theorists, demonologists, theologians, and judges was the fact that witches were charged with prying into forbidden, especially sexual, matters. They were women whose curiosity had led them to become sexual deviants, and their deviancy threatened the rigid gender hierarchy that defi ned what was seen as the divinely ordained, patriarchal social order.The norms of every period in western history include strictures as to what could and could not be known, and these strictures were applied differently in terms of gender, class, and race. Any group that attempted to exceed the parameters of knowledge set for it was denounced in a variety of ways, but a paramount charge was invariably that of sexual deviancy. This was especially true of individuals and groups who claimed to possess esoteric knowledge. By contesting prevailing wisdom and claiming access to a higher truth, they constituted a potential threat to the established institutions of both church and state, and they were routinely denounced as dangerously subversive, sexual perverts. Such charges were a standard rhetorical strategy on the part of any group whose authority was challenged—one has only to think of Pentheus’ fervid musings about the activities of the Bacchae, the Roman denun-ciation of Christians as incestuous sodomites, and the routine associa-tion of sexual deviancy with any group denounced today as a “cult.”2 Regardless of their polemical character, there is a certain amount of truth to such charges inasmuch as sexual antinomianism has been one possible consequence of claims to esoteric knowledge. But when it comes to female witches, we fi nd ourselves in a fantastic world where the perverse sexual knowledge ascribed to them was actually possessed by the theologians, inquisitors, and demonologists by whom they were charged, tried, and executed.2 For example, James Jones, David Koresh, and Reverend Moon. See Smith, “The Devil in Mr. Jones.”"},{"pageNumber":256,"pageContent":" probing women and penetrating witchcraft 233Even stranger is the fact that the curiosity motivating male authorities to undertake their investigations of deviant female witches in the fi rst place was displaced onto the women themselves, who ended up paying dearly for it as their bodies were probed for devil marks, penetrated for signs of unnatural intercourse, and destroyed in a sacrifi ce to appease an angry god. The question for us is, what led male demonologists, inquisi-tors, and judges in the early modern period to project their own sexual curiosity and erotic fantasies onto women and to consider some 29,000 of them threatening enough to justify their torture and execution?3 As several scholars have asked, if women did not actually do something to make them seem so dangerous, how can we explain the misogynist conclusions reached by so many intelligent, educated men?Witchcraft and the World Turned Upside DownHistorians have described the atmosphere of pessimism and gloom that marked the Reformation and Counter-Reformation periods. The bitter religious warfare endemic to the period combined with severe famines, peasant unrest, and the economic dislocations accompanying the emer-gence of proto-capitalism contributed to the sense that the world was in an irreparable state of decay and encouraged people to think they were experiencing the period of violence and anarchy preceding the millennium. The collapse of religious consensus was paralleled by the breakdown of traditional intellectual and scientifi c systems. The fl ood of new information that came from both the rediscovery of classical texts and the discovery of the new world undermined traditional philo-sophical and scientifi c frameworks and classifi catory systems, leaving many adrift on unchartered intellectual seas.4 The fascination with 3 Estimates of the number of people accused and executed for witchcraft have been vastly reduced from an initial fi gure of nine million. Even Brian Levack’s much smaller estimate of 110,000 trials and some 60,000 executions has been further cut by a third. Because many judicial records have been destroyed or are missing for much of western, southern, and eastern Europe, it is impossible to arrive at exact fi gures, but it is now thought that approximately 35,000 witches were executed, 29,000 of whom were women. See Monter, “Witch Trials in Continenetal Europe.”4 The instability created by the constant barrage of “news” (a word that fi rst appeared in our modern sense in the fi fteenth century) in all fi elds is compellingly described by Gabriel Harvey: “All inquisitive after Newes, new Books, newe Fashions, newe Lawes, newe Offi ces, and some after newe Elements, some after newe Heavens, and Helles to. . . .

Unlike Stuart Clark who has argued that it is “a question mal posé to ask why women were the main objects of witch persecutions,”7 it seems to me that this is and always has been the crucial question. Clark dismisses it as tautological on the grounds that the polarity between the genders was so fi rmly in place during the period of the witch hunts that witches were by defi nition women, and demonologists had “no choice” but to defi ne them as such.8 It is certainly true that a polarized view of the sexes was a part of Europe’s inheritance from classical sources, particularly Aristotle; but it was only in the early modern period that this polarity became fi rmly entrenched in learned discourse. Clark seems to recognize this. As he says, “In the case of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, one is struck forc-ibly by the profusion—almost a promiscuity—of indigenous styles much upon hearsay: Doctors contemned: The Text knowen of Mosis, understood of fewe; magnifi ed of all: practiced of none: the Divell not so hated, as the Pope: many Invenctives, small amendment.” Cited in Hayden, The Counter-Renaissance, 13.5 Daston & Park, Wonders and the Order of Nature.6 Rabb, The Struggle for Stability; Slaughter, Universal Language and Scientifi c Taxonomy.7 Clark, “The ‘Gendering’ of Witchcraft,” 427–428.8 Ibid., 432: “. . . a collective representational logic . . . required them to write as they did and may well account for the failure of their views to accord with the actual gender breakdown of some French witchcraft trials. . . . ‘Male’ and ‘female’ meant what they did to these authors not because of mere difference, but because they were thought of as polar opposites and were linked by analogy to other polar opposites within a broad symbolic system. Separated for the purposes of modern analysis but in fact always acting simultaneously, opposition and analogy were the formal constituents of the notions of gender that were intellectually dominant in early modern France—and indeed in witch-hunting Europe generally. Together, they ensured that demonologists had no choice where to assign women in relation to, for example, the moral polarity of good (God) and evil (the Devil), or the socio-political political polarity of superior-ity and inferiority. Nor was there any choice where to assign witchcraft in relation to the gender polarity itself.”"},{"pageNumber":258,"pageContent":" probing women and penetrating witchcraft 235of oppositional thought and writing, and by a delight in listing and exploring the binary aspects of experience.”9 Clark makes the further point that the various explanations suggested for why women were targeted as witches (the social marginality of poor, old, single women; the anomalous position of women who inherited male property; the increasing number of unmarried women) “have not shown . . . [and] cannot show . . . why the accusations should have concerned witchcraft rather than some other crime.”10 But I would argue that Clark has the argument backwards. Rather than accepting the identity of woman and witch as unproblematic, what needs to be shown is, fi rst, why witchcraft emerged as such a threatening possibility in the early modern period and, then, how the emerging defi nition of bad women dovetailed with the emerging image of the witch.Clark’s contention that the polarity of the sexes was already well established by the time of the witch hunts overlooks the fact that at the beginning of the period the prevailing view was that male and female sex organs were mirror images of each other. This was Vesalius’ view. As his student Baldasar Heseler wrote: “The organs of procreation are the same in the male and the female. . . . For if you turn the scrotum, the testicles and the penis inside out you will have all the genital organs of the female.”11 This idea became a source of considerable anxiety in the early modern period because it suggested that with too much physical exertion women might suddenly turn into men. The idea that the sex organs of men and women were fundamentally different and incomparable fi rst emerges in the seventeenth century with the idea of gender complementarity. As Londa Schiebinger and others have pointed out, the notion of complementarity was successfully used to argue that women’s unique and all-important function, marriage and motherhood, was divinely ordained and determined by their sex organs.12 Consequently, women were excluded from everything that was culturally and intellectually valued in the public world of men. 9 Ibid., 432.

Luther made this abundantly clear when he likened the good wife to a “snail” or “a nail driven into the wall,” commenting:She sits at home . . . . the wife should stay at home and look after the affairs of the household as one who has been deprived of the ability of administering those affairs that are outside and concern the state. . . . In this way Eve is punished.13The emphasis on women’s role in the family occurred at the same time their economic opportunities narrowed. Women, to use Merry Wiesner-Hank’s phrase, were “domesticated,” and the split between the public and private sphere so marked in the gender discourse of the nineteenth century was well in place by the end of the seventeenth.14The new image of the diabolical witch arose in conjunction with this new stereotype of the good wife. Before the late fi fteenth-century witches were not identifi ed predominantly as women. They could be male or female, and they were often well-born, if not noble.15 But by the mid-sixteenth century between 80–95% of those accused in most places were women, and there was an increasing focus on the sexual activities of witches. The witches’ Sabbath did not exist in the Middle Ages; it was an invention of early modern demonologists and clearly represented an increased fear and fascination with the whole gamut of female sexuality on the part of Catholics and Protestants alike. Charles Zika documents the changes in the visual representation of witches and witchcraft in the early modern period. Late fi fteenth-century illustra-tions show witches as both men and women who are fully clothed and engaged in various nefarious activities such as casting spells, harming animals, causing storms, etc.13 Lectures on Genesis, Gen. 3:16, Luther, Wo r k s, I, 202–3.14 Wiesner, Women and Gender in Early Modern Europe, 241: “Early modern Europe appears to have been a time when the public realm—politics in its broadest sense—was becoming increasingly male again, both in theory and practice. Women were ‘domesti-cated,’ told that their proper role was household and family and that public life was for men.

Note the naked witch on her knees and looking backwards between her legs. According to a contemporary German proverb this position allowed one to catch a glimpse of the devil. In a very real sense, what this witch sees is the ordinary world turned upside down.16 And this is precisely what the Witches’ Sabbath 16 Clark, Thinking with Demons, 13."},{"pageNumber":262,"pageContent":" probing women and penetrating witchcraft 239was. With its frenzied feasting and rampant sexuality, the witches’ Sab-bath was the inverse of orderly social and political life.17In his article “Inversion, Misrule and the Meaning of Witchcraft” and his later book Thinking with Demons, Stuart Clark points out that the habit of thinking in dichotomies was a key aspect of early modern mental life, encouraged by the study and practice of rhetoric and dialectic, which was the mainstay of male education at the time. Thus the existence of heaven naturally implied the existence of hell.18 James I makes this point in his Daemonologie: “Since the Devill is the very contrarie opposite of God, there can be no better way to know God than by contrarie.” The ultimate inversion for witchcraft theorists and demonologists was a demonical society dominated by women. The Scottish reformer John Knox did himself a profound disservice by writing his diatribe against The Monstrous Regimen of Women shortly before Queen Elizabeth ascended the English throne, but his palpable horror at the thought of women rulers was widely shared. The fascination with Amazons exhibited by 17 Larner, Enemies of God, 194ff.18 Clark, “Inversion, Misrule, and the Meaning of Witchcraft.”Fig. 4.

This was the technique used by William Gouge in his Domestical Duties. As he says, “because contraries laid together doe much set forth each other in their lively colours, I have annexed to every duty the contrary fault, and aberra-tion from it.”25 Petrus Ramus’ method of reducing complex subjects to their elements through increasingly simplifi ed dichotomies fi t in with this way of thinking and appears to have been particularly congenial to Protestants, although it was a standard aspect of rhetorical training for Catholics as well.26 Considering what was contrary to a proposi-tion was one of the most important methods for devising arguments for defense and refutation. Pattern books of rhetorical skill included sections on “The Contrary” in model orations.27 Stephen Greenblatt claims that an emphasis on being able to argue for or against any conceivable proposition “permeated intellectual life in the sixteenth 19 Kleinbaum, The War Against the Amazons; duBois, Centaurs & Amazons.20 Clark, Thinking with Demons, ch. 4.21 Bacon, De principiis atque originibus and De sapentia verterum in The Works of Francis Bacon, V: 475; VI: 710.22 Hunter, John Aubrey and the Realm of Learning, 126–27.23 Della Porta, Natural Magick, 5–6, 8–10.24 Wilson, “Contraries,” 351–68.25 Cited in Clark, Thinking with Demons, 60.

A kind of cordon sanitaire divided the world of order from the world of disorder and made confusion between the two increasingly unthinkable. The drawing of rigid moral lines is nowhere more apparent than in the fi eld of humor. Taste, propriety, and decorum became the watchwords of the moral Puritanism generated by both the Reformation and the Counter-Reformation. The scatological humor of Rabelais gave way to the refi nement of wit. The new moral universe left no place for the festivals of misrule that had fl ourished throughout the Middle Ages, reaching their apogee in the fourteenth and fi fteenth centuries.The description of one of these festivals in particular, the Feast of Fools, sets up a strange resonance in the ears of one attuned to witch-craft. During this mock religious ceremony, derived supposedly from the Roman Saturnalia, a Pope of Fools was chosen—a child, fool, cripple, or madman—who presided over a service that parodied the Mass. Mock deacons and sub-deacons ate black puddings and sausages on the altar while the “priest” offi ciated. The members of the congre-gation, many of whom were dressed as priests and nuns, danced and sang licentious songs, played cards, or rolled dice under the “priest’s” nose. Others threw bits of old leather into the thuribles to produce disagreeable smells. At the conclusion of the “Mass,” the congregation broke into riotous behavior. They formed a procession, danced, leaped about, sang, and exhibited themselves indecently. Some stripped naked. Every so often, the procession would halt while individuals mimed immodest postures and indecent actions to the accompaniment of bawdy songs and suggestive speeches.29 Only a change of perspective was needed to transform this popular festival into the Witches’ Sab-bath. And this is precisely what happened as the perspective changed from lay to clerical and inquisitorial culture. Dürer’s engraving of a witch is a case in point.28 Greenblatt, Renaissance Self-Fashioning, 230–1.29 Bakhtin, Rabelais and his World."},{"pageNumber":265,"pageContent":"242 allison p. coudertNot only does the witch ride backwards, an image of disorder, espe-cially sexual disorder, but she is mounted on a goat, itself a symbol of sexual lasciviousness. The distaff that should identify her as a submissive female is, instead, suggestive of a phallus. This together with the fact that she clutches the horn of the goat on which she rides implies that she has appropriated and controls male sexual power. Dürer’s witch is a powerful, wild, castrating, and cautionary fi gure of the dangers presented by disorderly women.30According to Hans Peter Broedel, the kind of witch envisioned by Dürer was largely invented by the Dominican inquisitors Henrich Institoris and Jacob Sprenger, authors of the notorious Malleus Malefi -carum (the Hammer of Witches) of 1486, a handbook for inquisitors that set down everything one needed to know about the evil activities of witches and the way to prosecute them.31 There was no ambiguity 30 Zika “Dürer’s witch”; Mellinkoff, “Riding backwards.”31 Broedel, The Malleus Malefi carum.Fig. 5.

The very title makes this clear since malefi carum is a feminine noun in Latin. The Mal-leus has been described as “scholastic pornography,”32 although one of the most recent books on witchcraft denies this—a subject to which I shall return.33 The authors clearly dreaded and loathed women. Witches were not only lying, cheating, credulous, vain, ambitious, untrustworthy, and lustful; they were also relentless castrators, as the following passage reveals. If this had not been written in deadly earnest and had deadly effects, it would be worthy of Monty Python:And what then is to be thought of those witches who . . . sometimes collect male organs, as many as twenty or thirty members together, and put them in a bird’s nest or shut them up in a box, where they move themselves like living members and eat oats and corn, as has been seen by many as a matter of common report?For a certain man tells that when he had lost his member, he approached a known witch to ask her to restore it to him. She told the affl icted man to climb a certain tree, and that he might take which he liked out of a nest in which there were several members. And when he tried to take a big one, the witch said: you must not take that one, adding, because it belongs to the parish priest.34One might well wonder what is to be thought of men who could accept such a preposterous story? Where did Institoris and Sprenger get such incredible information? How did they and the fellow inquisitors and judges infl uenced by their book come to have such clear and detailed knowledge about the sexual proclivities and activities of witches? And why was sex so central to their concerns rather than the harmful actions of witches, which were of far more interest to the common people who suffered from them? For answers to these essential questions, we can turn to Walter Stephens’ insightful book Demon Lovers.Stephens contends that witchcraft theorists were neither credulous fools nor prurient misogynists, but tormented skeptics trying to resolve the confl icts in Christian doctrine about the benevolence of God, the existence of spirits and souls, and the effi cacy of the sacraments. Neither irrational nor unscientifi c, witchcraft theorists deployed all the resources available from natural philosophy and theology to vindicate the goodness of God and the truth of the Bible.

Those principles remained central to Christianity from long before Martin Luther until long after the Council of Trent. They were not moral or ethical questions about conduct as we have been led to believe, but scientifi c problems of being and knowledge, concerning devils, angels, the human soul, the truthful-ness of the Bible, and the evidence of God’s existence and presence in the world. Witchcraft theory was far more than a demonology. It was not an anomaly in the history of Western Christianity. It was an expression of Christianity’s deepest and truest logic, although in oversimplifi ed and neurotic form. Not that its practitioners were usually treated as fanatics or obscurantist crack-pots; they participated in the most vital, wide-ranging, and up-to-date philosophical and scientifi c debates.35While Stephens sees 1400 as a pivotal date marking the point when significant numbers of educated Christians began to believe that human beings, especially women, interacted with demons in intensely physical ways—the most pronounced of which was through sexual intercourse—he argues that this belief was itself the end product of a long period of cumulative doubt that began in the twelfth century. The bed-rock Christian belief in spirits, both angelic and demonic, was undermined by fuller knowledge of Aristotle’s works from the twelfth century onwards. How were Christians to deal with the realization that “the philosopher” categorically rejected the existence of spirits on the ground that matter and form were inseparable aspects of an entity? The Aristotelian idea that physical events occurred as a result of strictly natural causes not only confl icted with the role accorded to spirits in the Gospels and later Christian thought but it undermined the belief both in divine providence and miracles, which Christians had routinely taken as concrete proof of the truth of Christianity and its superior-ity over other religions. Aquinas and his followers were profoundly disturbed by the Aristotelian idea that natural causes were the only viable “scientifi c” explanations for physical events, a view encouraged by growing contact with the Islamic world and the West’s absorption of the occult sciences of astrology, alchemy, and natural magic, all of which argued for natural rather than “spiritual” or divine causes.35 Stephens, Demon Lovers, 30."},{"pageNumber":268,"pageContent":" probing women and penetrating witchcraft 245Stephens accepts Salvatore Camporeale’s characterization of the period between the 14th and the sixteenth centuries as the “travail of Christendom.”36 The Black Death, the Great Schism, new methods of theological research, the discovery and dissemination of new texts, printing, mysticism, trade, travel, and the discovery of the new world all undermined established truths and called into question the idea of divine providence and God’s omniscience and benevolence. Misfortune, uncertainty, and insecurity called for a new theodicy, and Stephens argues that this was supplied by the witch theorists. A consistent theme runs through all their writings: the terrible fear that God, spirits, heaven, and hell did not exist. They wrote to assuage their deepest doubts, and these doubts could only be kept at bay by proving that spirits were real and interacted on a physical level with human beings.From Caesarius of Heisterbach’s Dialogus miraculorum (1225) to Chris-topher Marlowe’s Doctor Faustus, Christians were plagued by doubts about the reality of spirits, for if spirits did not actually exist but were fi gments of the imagination, how could one prove the existence of that most spiritual entity of all, God? Augustine claimed that spirits were incorporeal and that they had “aerial” bodies.37 But if this were the case, how could purely spiritual entities interact with physical human beings? Aquinas tried to resolve the question by asserting that although angels and demons were pure spirit, they could assume bodies made of air that had been condensed by divine power to a suitable shape. Aquinas and subsequent theologians devised a complicated explana-tion for how devils, who did not have real bodies, could copulate with humans who obviously do: as succubi (those lying under) they received semen from human males, which, as incubi (those lying above) they deposit in females. As Stephens points out, devils and demons became increasingly corporeal through the centuries, emerging in the fi fteenth century as “a riot of corporeality” with horns, reptilian tails, grotesque features, and faces inappropriately situated on their stomachs or poste-riors.38 Even more worryingly, during the period of most intense witch hunts in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, devils and demons often appeared in increasingly human guise to the point that they were virtually indistinguishable from human beings.

Or was it? The paradox was that as theolo-gians and witch theorists became more detailed and concrete in their scientifi c explanations for the corporeality of demons, they promoted the very skepticism they were at pains to allay.Stephens claims that the reason why witch theorists were so interested in proving the reality of demonic sex had little to do with an obses-sion with sex or misogyny but was a consequence of their attempt to provide irrefutable evidence that demons did interact physically with humans. What, after all, could be better proof of physical intimacy than intercourse?Literate interest in copulation with demons was hardly driven by pruri-ence, misogyny, or puritanical fervor. Literate men craved demonstrations that even sexual intercourse, the most intimate sort of bodily contact, was possible with demons. Copulation offered valuable perspectives on the life of demons, their corporeality, and the possibility of acting meaning-fully with them.39Stephens describes witch theorists as “metaphysical voyeurs”; their deepest desire was not to look through bedroom walls but through those barriers that separated the physical world of human beings from the spiritual life to come.40 While he admits that witch theorists were misogynists, he claims their misogyny served the purpose of proving that demons, and hence God, really existed. Witch theorists did not exploit theology in order to demonize women. They exploited the prevailing misogyny to reinforce a demonology that supported the theology they seriously doubted.Stephens makes a valid point, but only up to a point. His valiant attempt to apply this logic to the primary author of the Malleus Hein-rich Institoris (Henrich Kramer) and to exculpate him left this reader’s mind reeling!Of course the Malleus was misogynistic, but what for Kramer was the use of misogyny? To read his treatment of demonic copulation as a tirade against women’s sexual powers is to miss his point entirely. If anything, his tirade is for women’s sexuality. The issue was not keeping women in their place or controlling their sexuality. Henrich Kramer did not fear that women were associating with demons: he hoped that they were. His whole theology depended on women’s sexual transgressions, and it would have 39 Ibid., 19.40 Ibid., 32."},{"pageNumber":270,"pageContent":" probing women and penetrating witchcraft 247collapsed if he had ever had to admit that women’s behavior conformed to the patriarchal ideal of chastity and submissiveness.41One suspects that Stephens protests too much. It is impossible to believe that the long and tortured history of Christian ambivalence to sex and procreation and the misogyny this generated were not important con-tributing factors to witch theorists’ emphasis on the perverse sexuality of female witches.42 After 1400 those accused of witchcraft were no longer charged with practicing specifi c acts of magic (malefi cium) but simply with attending the Sabbath where demonic sex was a standard feature. Stephens’ explanation that demonic sex replaced malefi cium as the sine qua non of witchcraft because sexual intercourse offered better proof of demonic and human interaction—“. . . Kramer’s interest is not prurience but provability”43—is problematic. Surely, an emphasis on witches and demons making demonic pacts could have provided the same level of “proof ” that physical interaction was possible.The fact that witch theorists were so interested in the specifi cs of the sexual encounters between witches and demons, so detailed in their descriptions of the size and shape of demonic sex organs (enor-mous), so curious as to whether women preferred sex with demons or humans, so convinced of the painful and unpleasant nature of demonic intercourse, and so insistent that even demons refrained from “crimes against nature” (i.e. sodomy or even intercourse in anything but the missionary position) indicates a fi xation on sexuality profoundly colored by Christian attitudes to sex and celibacy. It also suggests that there was an increase in the level of misogyny in the late medieval and early modern period that made it possible for female witches to replace male necromancers, heretics, and Jews as the Church’s most dreaded and dreadful enemy. It is at this point that it is useful to return to Broedel’s analysis of the Malleus.While Broedel is prepared to admit that Institoris’ and Sprenger’s view of women was deeply misogynist, he supports Stephens to a 41 Ibid., 37.42 I can’t help thinking here of a passage from Nietzsche: “Do I counsel you to slay your senses? I counsel you innocence of the senses. Do I counsel you chastity? Chastity is a virtue with some, but with many almost a vice. These are indeed continent: but the bitch of Sensuality looketh enviously out of all that they do. This restless beast ever followeth them, even upon the summits of their virtues, and within the coldness of the mind. And how prettily can this bitch, Sensuality, beg for a morsel of mind when a morsel of fl esh is denied her!” (Nietzsche, Thus Spake Zarathustra, 47).43 Stephens, Demon Lovers, 40."},{"pageNumber":271,"pageContent":"248 allison p. coudertcertain extent by arguing that their identifi cation of witches as female “is quite probably descriptive rather than prescriptive” inasmuch as it represents popular opinion.44 In Broedel’s view, the genius, or perhaps it would be better to say the evil genius, of Institoris’s and Sprenger’s work is that it reconciled learned and popular views of witchcraft. As scholars have long realized, there was a gulf between what educated theologians thought about witches and the views of less well educated or uneducated lay people. Before the publication of the Malleus witch theorists and demonologists tended to view witches as heretics, allies of the devil bent on attacking the Church and enticing its members into sin and damnation. Ordinary people took a very different view. For them, witches were primarily women with the power to infl ict harm (malefi cium); the relation of these women with the devil was not an issue. What ordinary people wanted to know is why bad things hap-pened to them, and the witch supplied an ideal scapegoat in a society that looked for immediate and personal explanations for misfortune. In their role as Inquisitors, Institoris and Sprenger were continually confronted by this popular view of witches and witchcraft. But because it contradicted accepted authorities, who considered witches delusional and denied them any power, they felt obliged to construct a new model of witchcraft that reconciled learned and popular beliefs.Broedel argues that their new model was predicated on Aquinas’s view of the universe as an integrated whole in which the supernatural realm could be understood, at least partially, through observations of events in the natural world. Humans could speculate about God, angels, the devil, and demons because their actions were similar to human actions, although qualitatively different. Aquinas further believed that sensory experience presented reliable information about the actual world, at least if confi rmed by a majority of people, because God would not have allowed men to be chronically mistaken. This led Aquinas to accept the existence of such beings as Satyrs, Fauns, and incubi because “[m]any persons” attest that they have appeared to women. “Hence it seems folly to deny it.”45 Given this epistemological framework, Bro-edel contends that Institoris and Sprenger’s feminization of witchcraft was neither extreme nor radical in itself because it simply confi rmed popular conceptions. What was radical, however, was their rationale for why women were witches, a rationale that led them to compile “a 44 Broedel, The Malleus Malefi carum, 6–7.45 Summa Theologiae, pt. 1, qu. 51, art. 3. Cited in ibid., 94."},{"pageNumber":272,"pageContent":" probing women and penetrating witchcraft 249veritable summa of late-medieval misogynist commonplaces.”46 But what still needs to be explained, and Broedel does this up to a point, as we shall see, is why ordinary lay people accepted the extremely misogynist view of women presented by two Dominican monks. And here is where we come back to the issue of curiosity and the way it became gendered female in early modern western culture.Curiosity, Women, Sex, and SinCuriosity was routinely censured throughout the medieval and early modern periods. The paramount text for the negative assessment of curiosity was the Bible. Curiosity is condemned in the Testament and New Testament: “Be not curious in unnecessary matters: far more things are showed unto thee than men understand” (Ecclesiasticus 3:23). . . . “For all the Athenians and strangers that were there spent their time in nothing else, but either to tell or to hear some new thing” (Acts 17:21). Carlo Ginzburg emphasizes the effect that Jerome’s mistranslation of Romans 11:20 had in turning curiosity into a sin. Jerome translated Paul’s injunction “be not high-minded” as “noli altum sapere,” which was consistently interpreted to mean “do not seek to know high things.”47 But the text that had the most impact on women was Genesis 1–3, which expressly linked female curiosity to sex and sin. The fall was the result of Eve’s curiosity and subsequent eating of “the forbidden fruit,” a term that became synonymous with sex in the mind of the many Christian theologians who viewed the fall as a fall into sexuality.Women, sex, and sin became an unholy trinity that gathered force through the centuries until it culminated in the witch hunts of the early modern period. Paul Ricoeur has pointed out the recessive nature of the sexual interpretation of the Fall.48 Even when not explicitly men-tioned, it is there, appearing in the Catholic Church’s tortured view of marriage, sex, and contraception as well as in Protestant writings on marriage and sex.49 Although Augustine branded the idea that original sin was sexual as ridiculum, his writings are fi lled with ambivalent state-ments about women, sex, and procreation. Why, he asks did Adam and 46 Broedel, The Malleus Malefi carum, 176.47 Ginzburg, “High and Low”.48 Ricoeur, The Symbolism of Evil, 252ff.49 Flandrin, Un temps pour embrasser; Noonan, Contraception; Bugge, Virginitas; Bal, “Sexuality, Sin and Sorrow”; Coudert, “The Myth of the Improved Status.”"},{"pageNumber":273,"pageContent":"250 allison p. coudertEve immediately cover their genitals after eating the forbidden fruit? Because sin had led to sexual passion and a lack of self control. Before the fall, Adam had as much control over his sexual member as over a fi nger or arm. Passion and lack of self control was what was bad, not sex itself; but since a certain degree of passion is necessary if the act is to occur, Augustine cannot be said to have validated human sexuality.50 In fact, Augustine intensifi ed the link between curiosity and sex that was to prove so fatal for women. No one was more critical of human curiosity than Augustine, who defi ned it as one of the three forms of the vice “concupiscence”: lust of the fl esh, lust of the eyes, and worldly ambition. Curiosity was “lust of the eyes,”51 and Augustine links it directly with both the sin of pride and the fall. Curiosity was further denounced as the source of heresy and the black arts. The association of curiosity with sin, pride, heresy, and magic became commonplace in medieval thought.The conviction that curiosity could all too easily lead to magic was enshrined in the Faust Legend. Faust was only one of many fi gures damned for their curiosity.52 Icarus, Daedalus, Prometheus, and Proteus were others condemned either for aiming too high, or, as in the case of Proteus, for adapting too easily to changing circumstances. Such characters had little appeal for those who feared and distrusted change, viewing the world ideally as a static hierarchy in which individuals assumed, and were expected to keep, the occupations and roles into which they were born.But not everyone shared this negative view of curiosity. The recov-ery of classical and esoteric texts during the Renaissance, together with expanded trade and travel, encouraged some Europeans to view curiosity positively and to celebrate man’s capacity to understand and change the world. The opening paragraph of Pico della Mirandola’s Oration on the Dignity of Man describing man’s ability to become what-ever he wishes, even to the point of divinity, is too well known to need quoting. Pico places absolutely no limitations on man. He has only to “aspire” and to “will,” both key words in the Oration, and he will fi nd 50 Augustine, City of God, XIII, 13–14.51 Confessions, Bk. 5.3.3. For a discussion of patristic and medieval attitudes towards curiosity, see Steiner, “The Faust Legend”; Eamon, Science and the Secrets of Nature, 59ff.; Peters, “ ‘Libertas Inquirendi.’ ”52 For a provocative reading of Marlowe’s Dr. Faustus as illustrating the confl ict between Renaissance optimism and Christian pessimism, see Gatti, The Renaissance Drama of Knowledge, ch. 4."},{"pageNumber":274,"pageContent":" probing women and penetrating witchcraft 251himself “inferior to . . . [the angels] in nothing. [F ]or if we will . . . ” says Pico, “we can.”Pico’s emphasis on man’s ability to control his own destiny without any external help appears in the work of the Florentine Neoplatonist Marsilio Ficino as well. Ficino describes man’s striving to “become God” as entirely “natural,” in the same way that fl ight is to birds; man requires no external, divine assistance to become perfect in this world.53 Like Pico, Ficino quotes the Asclepius passage describing man’s ability to become anything he wishes, and he quotes Hermes Trismegistus to the effect that man is “a great miracle.”54A positive view of Icarus as the prototype of the scientist who dares to know appears in Giordano Bruno, who, as Hilary Gatti has pointed out, shared the Neapolitan poet Tansillo’s admiration for Icarus’ dar-ing, even though it led to death.55 Francis Bacon also rejected the traditional interpretation of the Icarus myth in a passage that echoes Bruno: “Icarus chose the better of the two; for all defects are justly esteemed more depraved than excesses. There is some magnanimity in excess, that, like a bird, claims kindred with heavens: but defect is a reptile, that basely crawls upon the earth.”56This positive assessment of curiosity was, however, a decidedly minor-ity view throughout the early modern period. As Barbara Benedict has shown, conservatives and conservative literary culture viewed curious people as “monsters,” “queers,” and “curiosities,” as intellectual and social transgressors because they dared to ask questions about for-bidden topics such as sex, religion, the origin of social customs, the sources and uses of wealth, and the justifi cation for social hierarchy.57 Conservatives were especially critical of London’s Royal Society and its virtuosi members who “peeped” and “keeked” (to glance illicitly or look furtively) into matters best left alone.58 But while they castigated and ridiculed curious males, their criticism came down with special harshness on females.53 Theologia Platonica, 2:247.

Curiosity was deemed a sign of discontent and curious women the harbingers of social chaos.In Cesare Ripa’s Iconologia (1611), for example, “Curiosità” is depicted as a huge, phallic female with wings and wild hair, who gazes straight ahead with out-fl ung arms as if to embrace the world. The emblem states that “curiosity is an unbridled desire of those that seek to know more than they should.” The fi gure’s red and blue dress is decorated with ears, signifying gossip, and frogs, which, according to Benedict, stand for human energy. Red and blue represent the body and the sky, which in turn symbolize carnal and intellectual knowledge.60 As Ripa’s fi gure demonstrates, curiosity was not an acceptable female trait, and any female who exhibited it was either unsexed or over-sexed. Female curiosity and the female gaze were highly charged topics in early modern literature inasmuch as both reinforced Augustine’s defi nition of curiosity as “concupiscence of the eyes” and the idea of women as sexually insatiable.61 No decent woman raised her eyes in public, and gazing was out of the question. A curious woman was therefore by her very nature unchaste at best and a witch at worst.The connection between female curiosity and sexual promiscuity was underscored by the deep linguistic connections between sex and knowing that I mentioned at the beginning of this chapter. One “conceives” an idea just as one conceives a child, and to express this idea one exclaims or “ejaculates.” The close association between knowledge, speech, and 59 Ibid., 116: “Impertinent curiosity, particularly sexual snooping, is an impulse traditionally attributed to women. From Pandora’s peeking and Eve’s eating, to Alice’s anxiety in Wonderland, female curiosity in religion, myth, popular culture, and high literature has meant a perverse desire to spy things out, particularly to know what makes men, men.”60 The theme of inversion is treated in Davis, “Women on Top”; Babcock, The Reversible World; Stallybrass, “The World Turned Upside Down,” 201–217.61 Benedict, Curiosity, 85, 128. Plato’s “hungry womb theory” also helped to reinforce the idea that women were sexually insatiable, as did Jerome’s mistranslation of Proverb 30:16.

Both the ancient Egyptian god Ptah and the god of the Hebrew Bible create through speech, and many Jews and Christians believed that animals came into existence only at the moment Adam spoke their names. In pictures of the Annunciation the Holy Spirit is often depicted as a beam of light directed at Mary’s ear.62 As George Steiner has said, “Eros and language mesh at every point. Intercourse and discourse, copula and copulation. . . . Sex is a profoundly semantic act. . . . Ejaculation is at once a physiological and a linguistic concept.”63Because William Harvey, the great biologist and discoverer of the circulation of the blood, could fi nd no traces of semen in the female deer he dissected (a problem with deer, apparently), he concluded that they “conceived” in much the same way thoughts are conceived in the brain. Just as the verb “to conceive” can be taken in both a physical and a mental sense, so too does the verb “to know” signify thinking and copulation.The association between thought and procreation and, more specifi -cally, the connection drawn between the brain and the genitals had the backing of thousands of years of medical theory. In the Timaeus (90e–91d), Plato remarks that semen is produced in the brain and descends to the penis via the spinal cord. This idea became commonplace in the Middle Ages among both Christians and Jews. The Zohar contains explicit descriptions of the physiological process through which the semen fl ows from the brain, through the body, and into the female.64 Leonardo da Vinci illustrated the supposed canals through which the semen was transmitted from the brain to the testicles.65 The great sixteenth-century surgeon Ambrose Paré accepted this idea, asserting that “a great portion of semen cometh from the brain.” This belief continued into the nineteenth century, providing the rational for the masturbatory theory of insanity. To this day we speak about an author’s “seminal” work.6662 “Glad us maiden, mother mild/Through thine ear thou were with child/Gabriel he said it thee.” This comes from the thirteenth century; quoted in Warner, Alone of All Her Sex, 37.

On the diffusion of this idea in medieval and early modern Judaism, see Biale, Eros and the Jews, ch. 5.65 O’Malley and Saunders, Leonardo da Vinci on the Human Body, 460–2.66 For an amusing discussion of these theories and their persistence in the eighteenth"},{"pageNumber":277,"pageContent":"254 allison p. coudertGiven the close association between thought, speech, and procre-ation, it becomes more understandable why one of the three virtues considered essential for women was silence (in addition to chastity and obedience). A women who spoke too much, and witches were reputed to do just that, was by her very nature suspected of being unchaste. Even thinking, and especially too much thinking, was considered a problem, even a vice, for women. As Mrs. Malaprop exclaims to young Lydia in Sheridan’s The Rivals (1773), “You thought, Miss! I don’t know any business you have to think at all; thought does not become a young woman.”67 By the time Sheridan wrote this, it was, at least partly, a joke, but the disdain for intelligent, educated women is a consistent theme throughout the Renaissance and early modern period and continues to this day. Educated women had a very hard time fi tting into society. Since the prevailing view was that intellect was masculine, learned women were treated like freaks. The highly intelligent and well educated Isolta Nogarola was actually put on exhibition, which only intensifi ed her fragile self-confi dence and self-esteem.68 After being awarded a doctorate, Elena Cornaro († 1684) achieved very little, for there was little she could achieve given the fact that women could not teach or work in the public sphere. She certainly did not have “a room of her own” in which to work, which is why some educated women joined nunneries if that option was available. At least there they might fi nd shelter in a “book-lined cell.”69 For most early modern males, a little female education went a long way. Hans Michael Moscherosch, a seventeenth-century Protestant minister, was especially insistent that “maidens” should “not know much.” As he exclaims, “Heaven spare us an experienced maiden!”70 This utter disdain for bluestocking women, as well as the implied suggestion that knowledge made her “experi-enced,” which certainly suggests a sexual dimension, was prevalent among Catholics and Protestants alike.The consistent ridicule and abuse leveled at intellectual, literate women was one of the innumerable dark sides of patriarchy and patri-archal culture. As Frances Dolan has pointed out, patriarchal authority century, see Ormsby-Lennon, “Raising Swift’s Spirit.” For the universality of these ideas see, Héritier-Augé, “Semen and Blood,” 158–175.67 Ferguson, Dido’s Daughters, 17.68 King, “The Religious Retreat of Isolta Nogarola.”69 King, “Book-Lined Cells”; Bell, “Christine de Pizan”; Kaufman, “Juan Vives on the Education of Women”; Ferguson, “A Room Not their Own.”70 Cited in Moore, The Maiden’s Mirror, 27."},{"pageNumber":278,"pageContent":" probing women and penetrating witchcraft 255entailed a monopoly of the written and, I would add, the spoken word. Dolan documents a number of examples in early modern English drama in which the plot hinges on confrontations between patriarchal fi gures and their subordinates over written documents. Gloucester grabs Edmund’s letter in King Lear; York grabs Aumerle’s letter in Richard II; Arden grabs Michael’s letter in Arden of Faversham. In each of these cases, the seized letters offer proof of conspiracy on the part of subordinates. All these examples involve males, but there are many others in the early modern period in which educated women confront men and challenge their authority. Catherine Schütz, the wife of the Strassbourg reformer Matthew Zell, had the temerity to quote Galatians 3:28 and Joel 2:28–29 to the very Bishop who told her to be silent when she protested the excommunication of her husband.71 Argula von Grumbach also defi ed the male establishment’s intellectual authority.72Hugh Peters’ condemnation of Anne Hutchinson provides a further illustration of how males reacted to women who ventured into the public sphere by speaking or writing. He was more troubled by her “masculine” behavior than by her antinomian opinions because such behavior threatened the natural superiority of the husband in the fam-ily unit. As Peters said:You have stept out of your place. You have rather been a husband than a wife; and a preacher than a hearer; and a magistrate than a subject; and so you have thought to carry all things in church and commonwealth as you would have and have not been humble for this.73Literate women were an anomaly precisely because they trespassed on what was deemed exclusively male territory and, in doing so, unsexed themselves.The theme of “The Man-Woman” or “The Womanish Man” was a very “potent” topic in the minds of early modern men. The very real fear that things were changing and getting out of place was frequently depicted in terms of gender reversal. In a satirical broadside entitled “A Character of a Turn-Coat: Or, the True Picture of an English Monster” 71 “You remind me that the Apostle Paul told women to be silent in church. I would remind you of the word of his same apostle that in Christ there is no longer male nor female and of the prophecy of Joel: ‘I will pour fourth my spirit upon all fl esh and your sons and your daughters will prophesy.’ ” Cited in Douglass, “Women and the Continental Reformation,” 307.72 Classen, “Footnotes to the Canon,” 131–148.73 Adams, Three Episodes of Massachusetts History."},{"pageNumber":279,"pageContent":"256 allison p. coudert(1707) the fi gures of a man and woman reverse roles when the sheet is turned upside down, a clear indication that the world is topsy-turvy.

Hermaphrodism became an important issue precisely because the hermaphrodite was both male and female and therefore did not 74 Davis, Society and Culture in 17th Century France, 100–1, 140; Underdown, “The taming of the Scold”; Moxey, Peasants, Warriors, and Wives; Roper, The Holy Household.

As Lorraine Daston and Katherine Park point out, in French civil law an individual’s gender determined his or her capacity to marry, inherit, act as a witness, assume the position of guardian, and hold political offi ce. The tremendous weight accorded to the question of a person’s gender meant that “sexual ambiguity was . . . not legally tolerated.”80The anxiety caused by hermaphrodites expressed a more general and intense fear of homosexual acts as well. However prevalent homosexu-ality may have been in court circles, the practice was generally viewed with revulsion and horror because it blurred the line between the sexes by undermining the dichotomy between the “active” male and “pas-sive” female. In this context it is understandable that amazons became a subject of considerable interest in the early modern period, for with their military skills and refusal to marry they too blurred increasingly rigid gender stereotypes.8176 Bauhin, De Hermaphroditorum Monstrosorumque Partuum Natura.77 Jung, Mysterium Conjunctionis and Psychology and Alchemy, in Collected Works, V. 12; ibid., Alchemical Studies, in Collected Works, vol. 13; Eliade, Forgerons et alchemistes; Wind, Pagan Mysteries in the Renaissance, 213–4; Merchant, The Death of Nature and Earthcare; Keller, Refl ections on Gender and Science.78 Waddington, “The Bisexual Portrait of Francis I.”79 Merry Wiesner points out that when a woman succeeded in domains reserved for men (literature, arts, sciences) she was said to have “overcome the limitations of her sex” or she was judged “a hermaphrodite.” In other words, her accomplishments did not spring from her female nature but from some additional of maleness (Women and Gender in Early Modern Europe, 147–8).80 Daston & Park, “Hermaphrodites in Renaissance France.”81 Taufer, “The Only Good Amazon Is a Converted Amazon”; Woods, “Amazonian Tyranny”; Sullivan, “Amazons and Aristocrats.”"},{"pageNumber":281,"pageContent":"258 allison p. coudertMaryanne Horowitz claims that “playing” with notions of gender was an acceptable Renaissance pursuit, but she admits that however play-ful various authors may have been in their discussions of autonomous female fi gures, they successfully refashioned them along increasingly polarized gender lines.82 But here is where we return to the fi gure of the witch.

In feudal society, gender roles were more easily differentiated inasmuch as men were expected to be warriors and women were not.

My question is, is this really “playfulness”?83 Zika, “She-Man.” In an extremely interesting article, Kelly documents the sex change undergone by the devil in the fi fteenth century. Long associated with the serpent in Genesis, the Christian devil appears with a woman’s head and torso in fi fteenth-cen-tury art and in literature at an even earlier date. See his article, “The Metamorphoses of the Eden Serpent.” From time immemorial serpents have been associated with sex, fertility, generation, and regeneration, and they have been worshipped accordingly. For Christians, however, the serpent has only negative associations and connotations. The fact that the serpent in the Très Riches Heures of the Duke de Berry as well as in Michelangelo’s Sistine chapel appears with a woman’s face, long blond hair, and a female torso offers another powerful image of a phallic (and sinful) female.84 Roper, The Holy Household; Wiesner, Women and Gender in Early Modern Europe, 252ff.

The stance of both groups was essentially feminine inasmuch as their role was to be pleasing, pliant, and subservient. J.R. Woodhouse describes the novelty of this situation and the confusion it occasioned in terms of gender identity.85 Military prowess and good advice were no longer suffi cient to curry favor with a Prince. Wit and the capacity to amuse became the primary avenues to success. But wit calls for the ability to deceive and dissimulate, for talents (if we may call them that) tradition-ally associated with women. In this situation, the age-old dichotomy between male and female became problematic, and the issue of what it meant to be either assumed a pressing urgency refl ected in the increas-ingly essentialist rhetoric of gender.The fear of effeminacy and the stigma attached to it led to a polariza-tion of the sexes that bordered on caricature. We can see this refl ected in the fashion of the period with the exaggerated codpieces worn by men and the emphasis on broad hips characteristic of Elizabethan dresses. We can also see it in the innumerable discourses about gender published in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. If we take a careful look at these texts, it becomes clear that, however much they discuss women, they are really written about men and intended for men. When women do appear, it is only to show what men must not be and must not do. As Barbara Correll argues, women have “an essential function” in the conduct literature of the early modern period; they are “projected as the horror of effeminacy, which must be contained.”86We can see this in Erasmus’ handbook for the instruction of young boys, when he advises young males to model their behavior in opposi-tion to that of girls:85 Woodhouse, Baldesar Catiglione, 54.86 Correll, The End of Conduct, 76: “Woman, marginalized or mystifi ed or demon-ized, was never excluded from Renaissance humanist writings. On the contrary, as the repository of an ideology of identity constructing the sex-gender system of patriarchal society, woman is everywhere in these texts, constructed to motivate the civilizing pro-cess, to further the projects of civic and Christian humanism. As the case of Erasmus shows, especially in humanist discussions of civility, woman has an essential function, projected as the horror of effeminacy, which must be contained.”"},{"pageNumber":283,"pageContent":"260 allison p. coudertAttention must be paid to the care of the teeth, but to whiten them with fi ne powder is for girls. . . .

To be constantly tossing the hair with a fl ick of the head is for frolicsome horses. The gait should be neither mincing nor headlong, the former being a sign of effeminacy, the latter of rage.87Given what Correll has described as “a kind of psychopolitical crisis of masculine identity and authority”88 and the attempt to resolve it through increasingly rigid gender stereotyping, Steven Ozment’s contention that Reformation morality allowed women “a position of high authority [as mothers] and equal respect [to men]” is simply not true.89 Rhetoric extolling mothers and motherhood is noticeably absent in texts dealing with conduct, just as mothers are noticeable by their absence in literature and art. Louis Montrose has commented on the signifi cant lack of mothers in Shakespeare.90 Mothers are signifi cantly absent from male autobiographies as well. One would hardly know from reading the autobiographies of Richard Baxter and John Locke that they had been “of woman born.”91 Jonathan Goldberg notes the same omission of mothers in Stuart family portraits.92 But even where wives and mothers are portrayed, there are subtle visual codes emphasizing patriarchal authority. Husbands are on the left of the picture plane so that the viewer would see him fi rst. The male often gestures toward his wife, reinforcing the idea of her subordination, and she is depicted in a passive, demure manner.93 Political imagery shows male rulers taking over female roles. King James I of England envisioned himself as the single parent of his realm, as “a loving nourish-father” who provided his subject with “their own nourish-milk.”94 Scientifi c texts dealing with reproduction exhibit the same denigration and absence of women. A pseudo-Paracelsian work described menstrual blood as the poisonous 87 Erasmus, “On Good Manners for Boys/De Civilitate Morum puerlium”, in Col-lected Works of Erasmus 25:269–89, esp. 276–78.88 Correll, The End of Conduct, 58.89 Ozment, When Fathers Ruled, 54, 202 n. 12.90 Montrose, “A Midsummer Night’s Dream.” Cf.

Carl Jung’s view of alchemy as a psychic and spiritual process in which the male and female aspects of the individual are unifi ed in a psychologically satisfying whole symbolized by the image of the hermaphrodite simply does not describe what alchemists thought or did, as we can see from illustrations accompanying the work of several German alchemists. Although the stone is frequently described as the offspring of a “royal” couple, in many cases this birth is better described as an act of cloning since the philosopher’s stone emerges solely from the father. This is the message delivered in Lambspring’s book of alchemical emblems. In one emblem, we can see the “king” or father swallow his son in the fi rst scene. The next scene shows the father in bed about to give birth to his son, while the fi nal scene shows the father together with his newly born son.98A similar message appears in the work of the German Lutheran alchemist, physician, and self-styled poet laureate, Michael Maier. In Maier’s alchemy, male and female are polar opposites, and they remain polar opposites. When males need the one power with which females are credited, namely the ability to bear offspring, they simply 95 [pseudo] Paracelsus, De natura rerum, in Sämtliche Werke, vol. 11, 315–16: “Nun aber damit ich widerumb auf mein fuernemen kom, von dem basilisco zuschreiben, warum und was ursach er doch das gift in seinem gesicht und augen habe.

Luther’s remark about how bizarre it was for him to wake up and see his wife’s braids on the pillow next to him is indicative of the radical reassess-ment that Protestant clergymen had to make about marriage and gender relations.In this respect, the witch was a cautionary fi gure, largely invented in the early modern period to keep women in their place. For witches were precisely those women who refused their newly prescribed role as silent, chaste, and submissive wives and mothers. The witch was the antithesis of the good wife. She was verbally abusive, when she should be silent, promiscuous—and homosexually promiscuous at that—when she should be chaste, domineering when she should be obedient, and out and about, when she should be at home. In short, witches were women who rejected the private world of female domesticity for the public world of men. They were women who rebelled and rebellion was routinely equated with witchcraft and rebellious wives with witches. This view of the witch held true for both learned and popular culture. Thus, however much early Protestants gave lip service to the spiritual equality of men and women and to the important role women should play in the household, especially in regard to the education of children, this did not manifest itself in actual practice. Instead, a new “theol-ogy of gender” emerged that affected Protestants and Catholics alike in which women were subordinated to men as never before and their roles in both the public and private sphere were constricted in new and unprecedented ways.105The paradox of Protestantism lies in just this: how did a radical evangelicalism predicated on the spiritual equality of all Christians, 103 Needham, A History of Embryology.104 Coudert, “The Myth of the Improved Status.”105 Wiesner, Women in Early Modern Europe."},{"pageNumber":291,"pageContent":"268 allison p. coudertregardless of gender, become a bulwark of a hierarchical social order solidly built on inequalities of gender, inequalities that remain alive and well among conservative Protestants to this day?106 Roper contends that the new Protestant ideology of marriage lies at the heart of this reversal inasmuch as it promoted an agenda of order and discipline predicated on the sole authority of husbands and fathers in the family and of male authorities in society at large.107 Thus in both theory and practice there was little to distinguish Protestants from Catholics when it came to gender roles in marriage. Patriarchal ideology was reinforced in both groups to such an extent that the father became the “legalized petty tyrant within the home.”108One might well ask why marriage became such a central issue in the mind of Protestant reformers. The short answer is sex and sin. Follow-ing Augustine, Luther and Calvin rejected the relative optimism about human nature characteristic of Renaissance humanists and emphasize instead the utter depravity of human beings. And like Augustine, they saw the nature of this depravity largely in sexual terms. To quote Calvin:. . . our nature is not only destitute of all good, but is so fertile in all evils that it cannot remain inactive. Those who have called it concupiscence have used an expression not improper, if it were only added, which is far from being conceded by most persons, that every thing in man, the understanding and will, the soul and body, is polluted and engrossed by this concupiscence; or, to express it more briefl y, that man is of himself nothing else but concupiscence.109106 Roper, The Holy Household: “How did this revolutionary evangelicalism become transformed into the consoling, socially conservative pieties of Protestant guildsfolk? How was it possible for a gospel which preached the spiritual equality of all Christians, male and female, rich and poor, and even denied the need for a priesthood, become the bulwark of a secular order based on Hierarchy? How could a religion which began by exulting in the prophetic talents poured out on daughters as well as upon sons come to view women almost exclusively as wives, whose sphere it was to be subordinate to their husbands and instructed by their preachers? . . . My central claim is that the moral ethic of the urban Reformation, both as a religious credo and a social movement, must be understood as a theology of gender” (1). As Morgan says so well, “the Puritans were no levelers” (The Puritan Family, 19).107 Roper, The Holy Household, 15. What is especially interesting is that precisely this same radical reversal occurred in early Christianity and for much the same reasons. See Pagels, Adam, Eve, & the Serpent and The Gnostic Gospels.108 Stone, Family, Sex, and Marriage, 7.

These stipulate that the Elders not only examine the behavior and speech of the citizens but also observe their attitude and intentions by visiting every household at least once a year and interrogating the residents. As the instructions ominously say, “in every precinct a lay elder should be chosen, who ‘can have his eye everywhere.’ ”110 Roper describes the all-embracing nature of the “Dis-cipline Ordinance” promulgated in Augsburg in 1537 with its attempt to micro-manage the rights, duties, and appropriate relationships of individual family members:The sexual discipline which the whole citizenry was to adopt was both more all-embracing and less well defi ned than it had been before the Reformation. Now any sexual relationship outside marriage was counted sinful and any occasion on which the sexes mingled, such as dances, might lead to sin. So absolute were the demands of the ideal that the Council was drawn inevitably to defi ne marriage and the relations which ought to hold between husband and wife, parents and children, masters and servants as it articulated the concept of discipline. Indeed, the ordinance amounted to an attempt to order the household, to emphasize the dis-tances which ought to exist between its members, and the defi ne the rights and duties of each. The same ordinance also included an admonition to all citizens to wear clothing appropriate to their social position, so that each may “be recognized for whom he or she is.”111What is so compelling about the concupiscence these regulations were established to monitor and restrain is that it was considered basically a female problem.I am not arguing that deviant female sexuality was not a subject of much mirth as well as horror in medieval literature. Medieval fabliaux make this abundantly clear. But in the Middle Ages, this literature was counter-balanced by courtly literature with its idealization of women and love and a recognition of the transforming effects of both on male 110 Eby, Early Protestant Educators, “Supervision by the Elders,” 252.111 Roper, The Holy Household, 112."},{"pageNumber":293,"pageContent":"270 allison p. coudertconduct. No such literary counter-balance exists in the early modern period. Sex is dangerous, and the dangerous sex is female.112 Female sexual deviancy became an obsession of male authorities and men at large, which explains why witch theorists expended so much time and effort interrogating witch suspects about the precise nature of their sexual encounters with the devil and demonic spirits, why prostitutes were demonized, prosecuted, and expelled from towns and cities that had previously accepted them as a necessary outlets for male libidos, why the number of women charged with sexual crimes increased expo-nentially, and why magistrates wanted ever-more details about the sex lives of those women they deemed deviant.113The fi gure of the sexually voracious women is endlessly elaborated and became an effective defense for males charged with sexual mis-conduct. Roper discusses a case in which a male was sentenced to four weeks in prison, while his partner in fornication was given the much harsher punishment of exile simply because he claimed that “she had sprung on him like a billygoat.”114 So conscious were males of the unbridled nature of female sexuality that even sewing-bees were looked upon with suspicion,115 and women were warned against the practice of solitary reading for fear it would lead to masturbation.116112 Kawerau, “Ein Beitrag zur Kulturgeschichte des sechszehnten Jahrhunderts,” 9–10: “A strong misogynist strain makes its way into the literature of the sixteenth century; when women are mentioned it is mainly to complain about them, to take cheap shots at or to insult them. Not a hint of the courtly poet’s chivalry and their veneration of women. A large percentage of the weaker sex in the sixteenth century appears to have earned the dislike of men. To an extraordinary measure they fl aunted not only extravagance and sensuality but excessive drinking as well.”113 Roper describes the situation in sixteenth-century Augsburg: “an even more important means by which female nature was defi ned and elaborated was the Council’s interrogation procedure itself. The Council regularly put far more detailed sheets of questions to women than to men, demanding to be told the full details of women’s sexual encounters” (The Holy Household, 85).114 Ibid., 85. Rothenberg comments on the malevolent power of the womb in Shakespeare and sees this as a sign of male anxiety (“Infantile Fantasies in Shakespear-ean Metaphor”). In his Anatomy of Melancholy (1621), Robert Burton proclaimed, “Of women’s unnatural, insatiable lust, what country, what village doth not complain.” In Love Given O’re, 5, Gould dwells on the platonic topos of the “hungry” womb: “Ev’n he himself [Plato] acknowledges the womb/To be as greedy as the gaping Tomb . . ./Takes Men, dogs, Lions, Bears, all sorts of stuff,/Yet it will never cry—there is enough.”115 Ibid., 179.

Dedekind and the Grobian authors who followed him sought to civilize males by inculcating the idea that boorish, coarse behavior is unmanly and, even more to the point, a sign of effeminacy.117 Grobian literature obsessively focuses on the materiality of the body, on its uncontrolled orifi ces as they vomit, excrete, urinate, and exude snot, semen, and blood.118 The object of this literature is to shame its male readers into proper, civilized behavior. This consists in subjugating and sanitizing the delinquent body, which is by defi nition female.119 The connection of women with the body and matter and men with the soul or spirit goes back to Aristotle and appears as a constant theme in the literature of the Middle Ages,120 but in the early modern period this dichotomy was drawn in starker terms than ever before as the genders became increasingly polarized. As Pierre Bourdieu observes, the project of civilizing the body is liter-ally embodied in such things as dress, comportment, and verbal and physical mannerisms. By these means what is essentially a purely social construct of gender identity is made to seem utterly “real” and to refl ect the divinely ordained natures of males and females.121examination and constant confession under the direction of the model priest, whose archeological skills were needed to unearth sin” (The Holy Household, 65).

Cotton Mather, for example, thought he was no better than a dog because he urinated: “I was once emptying the Cistern of Nature, and making Wa t e r at the wall.

How much do our natural Necessities abase us, and place us in the same regard, on the same Level with the very Dogs!’ ” Jonathan Edwards was equally appalled by his body: “The inside of the body of man is full of fi lthiness, contains his bowels that are full of dung, which represents the corruption and fi lthiness that the heart of man is naturally full of ” (Greven, The Protestant Temperament, 67).119 Correll, The End of Conduct, 19–20: “In the sex/gender system of the early mod-ern period, the civil subject must assert supreme identity by containment and erasure of whatever in the cultural semiotic scheme is identifi ed as the feminine—a project remarkable in both its futility and its historical effi cacy.”120 Horowitz, “Aristotle and Women.” McLaughlin, “Equality of Souls, Inequality of Sexes.”121 Bourdieu, “Structures and the Habitus.”"},{"pageNumber":295,"pageContent":"272 allison p. coudertScholars have pointed out how essentially repulsive Grobian literature is when it comes to sex. According to Barbara Könneker grobian sex is “dirty,” “unappetizing,” and “fecal/scatological.” While it is disgusting, it is not pornographic.122 Inasmuch as sex is associated with women, in addition to being dangerous sexual predators, women are equally dirty and unappetizing. Grobian literature was written for men, and even though reference is made to a female Grobiana, she is in an entirely different category. Grobianus is not by nature a boor; he is only a boor because he chooses to succumb to female infl uence. Grobiana, however, is what she is because she is female and can be nothing else. As Correll comments, “presumably you can take the Grobiana out of Grobianus and produce the civil subject that is, in fact, the project of the civilizing process . . . but . . . you cannot take the Grobiana out of Grobiana.”123 The upshot is that in the case of women shame and self-discipline are not enough by themselves to civilize them; they must also be sequestered and excluded from the public realm for their own good, but especially for the good of men.124ConclusionThroughout history women have always been vulnerable scapegoats during periods of social and political unrest. From the time of the elder Cato, who blamed the decline of the Roman Republic on the lasciviousness and greed of Roman women, to present-day conserva-tive religious movements, women have been cast in the role of human barometers registering the moral climate of nations. For men, chaste, silent, and obedient women are synonymous with a strong, well-ordered state. Hence the Anabaptists at Munster proclaimed the death penalty for wives who were insubordinate to their husbands.125This was one of the admittedly more extreme solutions to the very real problems in the early modern period. Warfare, religious confl ict, 122 See her introduction to Dedekind, Grobianus, xv.123 Correll, The End of Conduct, 130.124 Eby, Early Protestant Educators, 22–24. “School Ordinance from the Würtemberg Church Ordinance, 1559”: “And inasmuch as in some German schools not only the boys, but also the little girls are sent tot school, we determine that in such schools the children be separated, the boys alone and the little girls also be separately placed and taught, and that the schoolmaster by no means allow them to run back and forth among each other, or to have any disorderly relations with each other or to slip together.”125 Cohn, The Pursuit of the Millennium, 270."},{"pageNumber":296,"pageContent":" probing women and penetrating witchcraft 273social unrest, and the explosion of new information undermined established authority in the political, social, and cultural realms and contributed to the growth of skepticism. A new system of order was desperately needed, and in major respects it was built on the backs of women, especially witches. Broedel claims, and I entirely agree, that what demonologists like Institoris and Sprenger were essentially doing was offering their contemporaries a new conceptual framework with which to view the world, an ordering system, so to speak, which explained evil in terms of female sexual sins and attributed social dis-order to disorderly women.Institoris and Sprenger defi ned witchcraft so as to localize the respon-sibility for sexual sin in the bodies of particular women, bodies which could be discovered, punished, and burned. Further, by the very act of categorization order was imposed: through the creation of an ordered semantic and intellectual system, Institoris and Sprenger provided the necessary terms of a satisfactory symbolic discussion of human sexual-ity, order, and power. In this new conceptual fi eld, disordered sexuality is identifi ed with the devil, inverted gender roles and sexual dysfunction with witchcraft, and defective social and political hierarchies with women and women’s sins. None of this, however, is possible without the use of witches and witchcraft as an ordering term; witchcraft, as it were, provides the conceptual grid which binds this cognitive map together.126If we take Broedel’s notion of witchcraft as an “ordering system” and combine it with Stephens’ claim that demonologists provided anxious early modern males with a “new theodicy,” we can see that the witch hunts of the early modern period were not aberrations in an other-wise progressive age, but an essential element in the creation of a new epistemology and ontology predicated on increasingly exaggerated gender stereotypes of all-powerful males and powerless females. This male/female dichotomy, however, did not fi t the facts. As mothers, wives, sisters, lovers, and friends, women have always had power. But the more strenuously that power was denied, the more threatening it became. In a spectacular return of the repressed, the fearsome, phal-lic fi gure of the witch emerged almost fully formed from the fervid imaginations of Institoris and Sprenger.Foucault’s idea that power is diffused throughout the social system and not simply exercised from the top down is useful here because it recognizes that subordinated groups, in this case women, can and do 126 Broedel, The Malleus Malefi carum, 179."},{"pageNumber":297,"pageContent":"274 allison p. coudertexert power. For Foucault power is always bound up with resistance. But what is so interesting in the case of the witch hunts is that demonolo-gists and witch hunters were the ones to resist, yet they were also the ones in power. Witches had no power to resist. They could not defend themselves. They could not even transgress for the simple reason that their transgressions were fi gments of the imaginations of their male cre-ators, who, for reasons I have tried to document, had an unprecedented fear and dread of female power. The fear of women that created the modern stereotype of the witch did not, however, disappear with the end of the witch hunts. It continued to haunt the western male imagi-nation well into the nineteenth century and even in some quarters until today.127 But that is a subject for another article.The early modern period was characterized by a turn toward the literal and a distrust of metaphor and the imagination. There was an increasing tendency to see things in black and white, to emphasize dif-ference rather than similarities, and to organize thought in terms of inviolable dichotomies. The fi gure of the witch was symptomatic of the increasing intellectual rigidity that produced new gender stereotypes based on an unprecedented dichotomy between the sexes. The essentialiststereotypes that emerged represented one attempt to restore order and certainty to a world racked by skepticism, confusion, inconsistency, and hypocrisy. But at the root of the new ideology of gender was a new worldview in which God and man, spirit and matter, reason and emotion, culture and nature, public and private, work and family, and church and state were polarized as they had never been before.BibliographyAdams, C.F., ed., Three Episodes of Massachusetts History: The Settlement of Boston Bay, the Antinomian Controvery, A Study of Church and Town Government.

Two interpretations have been, and still are, particularly prominent. The fi rst one considers her as a “personifi cation,” that is, just an aspect or even a mere metaphor of Christ or of the Holy Spirit (an interpreta-tion fostered by the use of the very term “Divine Wisdom”); whereas, according to the other, she is a “real Person,” alongside the Trinity, albeit not a/the fourth Person.3 For people of the second persuasion, she may easily become someone with whom, by defi nition as it were, a personal relationship is possible. And this relationship has proved in some cases to take on the form of an amorous, even intimate4 rap-port, as documented notably in the literature of the Christian current called Theosophy.Indeed, one of the most cherished themes in theosophical litera-ture5 is Sophia. Although Christian Theosophy clearly emerged at the beginning of the seventeenth century with Jacob Boehme (1575–1624), 1 Particularly Ecclesiastes, Proverbs, Baruch, Sirach and Wisdom. See discussion in Lang, “Wisdom,” who argues that although she has often been treated as a literary personifi cation, originally she was probably a real goddess.2 For an overview, see Schipfl inger, Sophia-Maria.3 Several biblical passages would seem to present Sophia as a “real person.” She claims she was “created”: “The Lord created me the beginning of his works, before all else that he made, long ago. Alone, I was fashioned in times long past, at the beginning, long before earth itself. When there was yet no ocean I was born” (Proverbs 8:22–24, according to the New English Bible). She also says that “the man who rises early in search of her will not grow weary in the quest, for he will fi nd her seated at his door” (Wisdom of Solomon 6:14).4 A number of passages in the biblical texts dealing with Sophia were of a nature to foster such a kind of interpretation. For example: “Wisdom I loved; I sought her out when I was young and longed to win her for my bride, and I fell in love with her beauty” (Wisdom of Solomon 8:2).5 For an overview of the theosophical current, see Faivre, “The Theosophical Cur-rent,” and “Christian Theosophy”; and Versluis Theosophia and Wisdom’s Book."},{"pageNumber":305,"pageContent":"282 antoine faivrean important predecessor in the preceding decades was the German physician and alchemist Heinrich Khunrath (1560–1605), best known today as the author of Amphitheatrum Sapientiae Aeternae, written in Latin. That book originally appeared in 1595, but the second and consider-ably enlarged edition (1609) has greatly contributed to its fame.6 For the most part devoted to an extensive commentary on the sapiential texts of the Bible, it is also replete with many alchemical, neo-paracelsian discussions, and the twelve complex illustrated plates which adorn it were to become even more famous than the text itself. Khunrath took Sophia to be a real person but did not claim to have been in “sensu-ous” contact with her.7 However, it is probably the Amphitheatrum that sparked off the strong interest in the Divine Wisdom over the three following centuries, beginning with Boehme’s sophiology.Boehme’s visions and speculations bear mostly on Sophia’s ontological and cosmosophical role, but he also strongly emphasized the notion of “God’s corporeality.” Besides, his works are not devoid of some pas-sages that might signal an occasional intimate relationship with her. For example, he writes that she addressed him as her bridegroom: “O my fi ancé/how good I feel in being married with you/do kiss me with your desire/that I may show you all my beauty.”8 Nevertheless, sensu-ous though this may sound, it is intended in a mostly “interior” way; indeed, a little further she adds: “I will have my dwelling within thy innermost/and be your dear faithful bride/I do not marry your ter-restrial fl esh/because I am a queen of the heavens/And my kingdom is not of this world.”9Some later theosophers, while endorsing Boehme’s views in the main and maintaining the necessity of an “interiorisation” of Sophia within 6 For a bio-bibliography of Khunrath, see Telle, “Khunrath, Heinrich.”7 Sensuous evocations are not absent from Khunrath’s text for all that. See for example in Appendix I how he commented upon Wisdom of Solomon 8:2 (quoted above, note 3). But the expressions he uses there, which also bear the mark of The Song of Songs, may be interpreted metaphorically as well. Let us note in passing that Wisdom of Solomon, although absent from the German translation by Luther, was not ignored, present as it was in other translations. Khunrath devoted long commentaries to it in his Amphitheatrum.8 “O mein Bräutigam/wie ist mir so wohl in deiner Ehe/küsse mich doch mit deiner Begierde/in deiner Stärke und Macht/so will ich dir alle meine Schöne zeigen” (Böhme, Der Weg zu Christo, 31).9 “Ich will mit dem Perlein im inneren Chor wohnen/und deine getreue liebe Braut seyn: In dein irrdisch Fleisch vermähle ich mich nicht/dan ich bin eine Königin der Himmeln/und mein Reich ist nicht von dieser Welt” (Böhme, Der Weg zu Christo, 33)."},{"pageNumber":306,"pageContent":" sensuous relation with sophia in christian theosophy 283our soul, insisted on the possibility of establishing a kind of physical rapport with Sophia. The fact that this occasionally took on an erotic character constitutes one of the most interesting chapters in the his-tory of the relations between eroticism and esotericism. This chapter discusses some examples of that particular trend as represented by Christian theosophers—a trend which does not seem to have reached fruition until the second half of the seventeenth century, notably with Johann Georg Gichtel.Johann Georg Gichtel, the Theosopher of Amsterdam (1738–1710)After unsuccessful efforts to found an evangelical missionary society in his city of Ratisbon, where he had some problems with the clerical authorities, Gichtel came to live in Amsterdam in 1668 and was to remain there for the rest of his life. He made his mark in Christian Theosophy for two main reasons: he was the fi rst editor of Boehme’s “complete works” in 1682; and he wrote 838 letters which were edited in six volumes by his disciple Johann Wilhelm Überfeld under the title Theosophia Practica10 (plus a seventh volume which contains his biography by Überfeld). On the ontological level, most of his ideas about Sophia as developed in Theosophia Practica are congenial to those of Boehme,11 of whom he nonetheless does not appear to be a mere epigone.12 In a letter of 1701 he explained to a correspondent, in a very boehmian manner, what Sophia was supposed to be, namely “the mirror of Eter-nity in which the Spirit has seen from Eternity all his works in Fire and 10 The edition of Theosophia Practica (henceforth referred to here as Th.

In this respect, the Lutheran Gichtel held that the “papists,” in particular the monks living in cloisters who worship the Virgin Maria, had not found “the right foundation,” that is, Sophia, whom he considered the more important of the two female fi gures because it was she who “opened herself into Maria’s virginal tincture.”13 Her presence permeated and pervaded the created world (the skies, the plants and fl owers, the metals, etc.).14According to Gichtel, when Moses says in Genesis that Adam and Eve were blessed, and that the animals were presented to them so that they could be given names (Genesis 1:28), it is not Eve proper who is meant, but in reality the celestial virgin Sophia who dwelt in Adam and whom we, poor children of that same Eve, have unfortunately lost.15 Although one of the consequences of the Fall is the existence of the phallus—“an instrument of Venus, not of Sophia”16—Sophia’s own aspect is that of a human creature; her members are similar to ours, albeit not of an animal kind.17 She has been Moses’ mouthpiece and was “rekindled”, that is to say, married again, to humanity and called upon to become the new spiritual body of a newborn Christ. What a wife is to her husband, she can be to our souls.In accordance with Proverbs 8:27–31, Gichtel stresses her “playful” aspect. This biblical passage teaches that she “played” with God,18 but Gichtel claims she also played with Adam. To the present day she still 13 See Sophiana III.14 See Sophiana IV.15 “Und ob schon Moses in der mehrern Zahl schreibet: Gott segnete sie, so ist solches nicht von Eva, sondern von Sophia zu verstehen, welche aus dem Seelen-Feuer leuchtet” (Th. P., 299–300, 20 August 1697). Similarly, Gichtel also wrote that when God said it was not good for Adam to remain alone, He actually meant that the Celestial Wisdom should dwell in him (Th. P., 1047, 10 January 1699).16 “Nun ist das männliche Glied ein Instrumentum Veneris & non Sophiae, und wird Hebräisch Jarech genennet, welches auch Lenden oder Hüft heisset, weil die Venae spermaticae auf der Hüft liegen” (Th. P., 301, 20 August 1797).17 “Ihre Gestalt ist eine menschliche Creatur von solchen Gliedern als wir Menschen, aber ohne thierische Glieder” (Th. P., 1800, 5 November 1709).18 “When [the Lord] set the heavens in their place I was there [. . .], I was at his side each day, his darling and delight, playing in his presence continually, playing on the earth, when he had fi nished it, while my delight was in mankind” (Proverbs 8: 27–31)."},{"pageNumber":308,"pageContent":" sensuous relation with sophia in christian theosophy 285longs to be our playmate.19 This playfulness is depicted in Gichtel’s letters in such as way that it often takes on an erotic character, linked by the author to the notion of creative “imagination.” He claims that the latter can function within ourselves if we possess a heart fi lled with “desire.”20 It is a matter of “focusing our imagination on her,” while surrendering ourselves to her with our body, soul, and spirit.21 When all the doors are closed by the “locks of darkness,” we have an effi cient weapon against the spiritual and practical hardships of our life by using our “strong Imagination,” and then we will experience in what a friendly way she will take “her man, whom she had lost in Adam” in her arms and kiss him. If the Imagination is properly Love-oriented, a fl ash of lightning will burst forth within our soul, which in turn will engender a light spreading over our senses.22 Gichtel compares this process with the magia operated by a magnet, and with what happens in ordinary life when one falls in love.23 He occasionally describes the process as a tense expectation ending up in a kind of orgasmic pleasure (clearly modelled on Boehme’s concept of the “fl ash of lightning” that appears from the struggle of dark opposing qualities as part of the cosmogonic “birth of God”).24 Then, once united with Sophia, man retrieves his prelapsarian state and enters a Paradise in which he enjoys his fi ve senses in a most extraordinary, albeit “interior” way; he tastes, feels, 19 Überfeld writes that Adam would play with her amidst the divine wonders which were hers (“Adam [spielte] mit seiner Jungfrauen in ihren Gottes-Wundern,” Th. P., vol. VII, 148). And Gichtel says about himself: “ich spielte lange Jahren allein mit der Göttlichen Weissheit, was ich empfunden, kan ich nicht schreiben; es öfnete sich aber ein Spiegel nach dem andern, dass ich mit allem Gefundenen nicht vergnüget, ich wolts auch gern allen Menschen gegönnet haben” (Th. P., 908, 11 June 1698; see also in Sophiana IX: “Was er nun bei solcher Vermählung und Hochzeit empfunden, wünschte er auch anderen Seelen zu geniessen, weil es ihm an Worten ermangelte”).20 “Imagination und Begierde des Herzens [sind] erfordert” (Th. P., 2756, 1 Sep-tember 1699).21 “setzet im Gebät eure Imagination in Sie, als in eure Haus-Frau, und ergebt euch in ihr Liebe-Regiment mit Leib, Seele und Geist” (Th. P., 3635, 4 May 1708).22 See Sophiana V. This image of a fl ash of lightning giving birth to the light is to be found already in Boehme, who described that “fl ash” (“Blitz”) as the “fourth quality” (“Qualität”) which results from the fi rst two opposite “qualities” struggling with one another in the dark “Angstkammer” of the third quality—a struggle which is part of the cosmogonic process of the “birth of God.” This mythemic element was to be felicitously taken up again by Franz von Baader (see his infl uential essay Über den Blitz als Vater des Lichts).23 See for example Sophiana VI.24 See for example Sophiana VII."},{"pageNumber":309,"pageContent":"286 antoine faivresmells, sees, and hears Sophia even better than a husband does with his cherished wife.25Several passages in Theosophia Practica purport to substantiate these views through a narrative of personal experiences. Indeed, his friend and disciple Überfeld informs us that in 1673, on Christmas day, Gichtel, who was praying intently, found himself surrounded by a dark cloud which transformed itself into a white one within which Sophia appeared to him in person “in the form of a virgin.” She embraced the fi re of his soul and “married him.” No spouse, we are told, would be able to “play” with her husband in such a lovable way as Sophia did with Gichtel’s soul. The sweetness was ineffable, but Gichtel made a point of remaining rather discreet as to some further details: it is not appropriate, he writes, to discuss what happens in the marriage bed. We are told, though, that Sophia spoke to him “from mouth to mouth,” promised him conjugal faithfulness as well as perpetual help in all the hardships that might befall him, and claimed she would bring a spiritual seed into him. Henceforth, “everything he had refrained from accepting from rich women she would replace.”26 Her language was “interior,” without any “exterior” words. It had no sounds and could not be compared to any human tongue, but he was able to under-stand it as if it had been his mother’s tongue.27 Although the wedding proper ended around the beginning of 1674,28 they were never to be separated from one another again. Up to this point, the descriptions of Gichtel’s relationship with Sophia have been taken from Überfeld’s statements, but in at least two of his own letters, one from 1698 and the other from 1709, Gichtel had already given a very similar, albeit less detailed, account of the experience.29 He writes that it lasted for 25 See Sophiana VIII.26 See Sophiana IX. The idea of Sophia and Gichtel happily living under the same roof, as it were, is reminiscent of the passage in Wisdom of Solomon (8:16): “When I come home, I shall fi nd rest with her; for there is no bitterness in her company, no pain in life with her, only gladness and joy.”27 “Der Weisheit inwendige Sprache war ohne äusserliches Wort, ohne Klang, ohne Thon; sie war auch keiner menschlichen Sprache gleich, und dennoch verstund er sie so wol als seine Mutter-Sprache” (Th. P., vol. VII, Gichtel’s biography by Überfeld, 146).28 “Und währete diese Hochzeit bis zu Anfang des 1674ten Jahrs” (Th. P., vol. VII, Gichtel’s biography by Überfeld, 144).29 See Sophiana X.

Alas, few among them are capable of seek-ing to share with her more than voluptuous pleasure, few are desirous to satisfy her burning desire to make them pregnant, thus “begetting” (ausgebären) the “children of love.”36“Begetting”? As a matter of fact, just as the conjunction of a man and a woman is necessary for a child to be born, likewise, without Sophia and/or Christ we engender nothing. Here, man is assigned 30 Th. P., 908, 11 June 1698 (see quotation above, n. 19).31 For example: “Sie nimmt keine irdische Begierde in sich ein, lässt sich auch von keinem Grimmen-Geist bezwingen; der aber demütig von Herzen ist, [. . .] den umarmet und küsset sie, und führet ihn in ihre Braut-Kammer zur Schaulichkeit” (Th. P., 2722, 25 August 1699).32 “Ich kan euch in Wahrheit schreiben und bezeugen, dass unsere himmlische Jungfrau weit inbrünstiger in unser Seelen-Feuer verliebt ist, als eine verliebte Braut in ihren Bräutigam, und schmertzet sie höchstens, dass wir ihre Liebe so geringe achten, und uns mehr als sie lieben” (Th. P., 1221, s.d.).33 “Die Jungfrau GOttes arbeitet in der Seelen, wieder ihren Bräutigam, den Sie in Adam verloren zu erblicken; darum wil Sie uns gantz in ihre Arme haben und eifert über unsere irdische Buhlerey” (Th. P., 2040, 14 July 1699). See also, for example, Th. P. , 3024, 11 August 1699.34 “Sie läuft uns, ob wir schon noch ferne sind, mit feurigen Augen, Hertzen und Armen entgegen, und küsset unser Gemüt und Feuer-Grund” (Th.

Indeed, Gichtel tells his cor-respondents that they can feel it within themselves when Sophia has made them pregnant, followed by a period of labor which makes them suffer until the child, the “little boy,” is born;37 but thereafter the joy is so great that it could not be put into words. Nevertheless, if Sophia plays here the role of the father and a man that of the mother, these roles are interchangeable as well, since she is also both fi ancée and mother.38 In terms of motherhood, Gichtel compared himself to a child quenching his thirst at the “sweet milk” of his mother’s (Sophia’s) breast.39 Despite the “sweetness” of these descriptions, another aspect of Sophia is stressed too, that of a fi ery fi ghter who, after giving milk to her lover, engages him into a common war against the Devil, also called the Dragon.40Understandably, the theosopher of Amsterdam was grateful to God for imparting to him these sublime mysteries and revelations, a blessing which persuaded him to never bind himself to any woman. He claimed that his choice for sexual abstinence proved all the less diffi cult to practice since Sophia gave him, as a gift, a “chaste complexion” which helped him protect himself from Venus.41 Furthermore, intercourse with Sophia provides him something that Venus could not possibly give, namely a special kind of knowledge (a “gnosis”). Überfeld writes that Gichtel “played with his Virgin [Sophia] in her God’s wonders,” thereby receiving the revelation of the “hidden secrets” related to the Fall of Adam, the new birth in Christ, and the fi ght of Michael against the Dragon.42 Gichtel himself claimed that her light opened up his 37 “Die Zeichen werdet ihr innerlich wol empfi nden ob ihr mit Sophia geschwängert seyd, und die grossen Gebuhrts-Schmerzen fühlet: Welche Wehen zwar oft ankom-men; es ist aber die Gebuhrt oder Knäblein noch nicht reif genug” (Th. P., 2616, 17 May 1701).38 This interchangeability is also documented in the theosopher Johann Jakob Wirz (1778–1858), a silk weaver from Basel: Sophia as mother can be spouse too, and a child can also be husband to his mother (Schipfl inger, Sophia-Maria, 233).39 “[Sophia] gibt uns erst von ihrer lieben Mutter-Milch zu trinken, und machet unsere Seele feurig und inbrünstig” (Th. P., 2615, 17 May 1701). And Überfeld wrote: “[Gichtel] genoss der süssen Liebes-Milch in lauter Freuden: Was er nun gebäten; oft nur mit Einem Gedanken, das stund da” (Th. P., vol. VII, Gichtel’s biography by Überfeld, 149).40 See for example: “Eben also gehet Sophia mit uns zu Werk; sie führet uns nicht gleich in den Krieg mit dem Teufel im Fleisch, sondern gibt uns erst von ihrer Mut-ter-Milch zu trinken, und machet unsere Seele feurig und inbrünstig” (Th.

Besides, the capacity of Sophia to reveal “hidden truths” about the universe is mentioned in the Wisdom of Solomon.44Although he praised the virtues of virginity, Gichtel did not reject marriage and contented himself with mentioning St. Paul’s position on this matter, namely, that it is better not to marry45 (I Cor. 7, 9). But Überfeld also informs us that the theosopher of Amsterdam felt unhappy listening to some married men and women who told him about their spiritual life “with bloody tears in their eyes.” They confessed they were ashamed of what they did in bed, lamenting that sexual intercourse resulted in a loss of divine strength within them.46 This is confi rmed by the fact that a number of Gichtel’s followers, who went under the name of Gichtelianer (Gichtelians) or Engelsbrüder (Angelic Brethren, or Brethren of Angelic Life), were intent upon retrieving the state of virginal per-fection lost by Adam. Überfeld was instrumental in the establishment of that community, which began to function in earnest in 1710. It did not count a great many members, but its long existence is documented in Central Europe well into the twentieth century.47In this connection, although Gichtel said (as noted above)48 that he regretted that during his “honeymoon” with Sophia he could not share his happiness with other persons, he did in fact share it, perhaps as early as 1674. According to Überfeld he brought together a few people from various places in the Netherlands in order to establish some sort of a sophianic cult. Enthusiastic as they were over Sophia, they would become inebriated and dance and sing, intoxicated as if they had been drinking too much wine. Each of them were keen “to get a sweet kiss” from her. They “cried” because their thirst had not been quenched and 43 “Sie öfnete auch den Verstand, dass man in der Tiefe beydes in Himmel und Hölle von ihr bestralet” (Th. P., 1799, 5 November 1709).44 See for example the passage where the author of Wisdom of Solomon writes how he was granted “a knowledge of the structure of the world and the operation of the elements [. . .] the nature of living creatures [. . .]. I learnt it all, hidden or manifest, for I was taught by her whose skill made all things, wisdom” (Wisdom of Solomon 6:17–22).45 See for example Th. P., 3644 (17 July, year unknown): “Wir verbieten die Ehe nicht, [. . .] und sagen mit Paulo, dass es besser sey, ledig zu bleiben, als zu ehlichen.”46 See Sophiana XIII.47 See for example Hutin, Les disciples anglais, 182 s, n. 26; and Gorceix, Johann Georg Gichtel, 28–29.48 See above, notes 19 and 30."},{"pageNumber":313,"pageContent":"290 antoine faivreeven tried “to rush into the bedroom of the bride.”49 These fi ts of what looks like a collective trance are corroborated by some allusions made by Gichtel himself in his correspondence.50In closing, it would seem appropriate to mention another striking point about the sensuous aspect of Gichtel’s sophiology. Notwithstanding his frequent warning that the relationship with Divine Wisdom should not be too “terrestrial,” some very practical advantages are reported to have been gained through that companionship. To wit, she is reported to have been a house hunter, as it were, in the sense that she was materially and directly instrumental fi nding in Amsterdam some of the dwellings in which Gichtel successively lived. In particular, it was she who “procured” (versorgete) a house for him in May 1698 which suited him to perfection and where he was to spend the rest of his life.51 In a similar way, she is reported to have gone as far as to lend Überfeld a hand in his editorial task of editing Gichtel’s correspondence after the latter’s demise.52 Are we dealing here with an experiential way of literally interpreting the passage in Wisdom of Solomon, which reads: “the man who rises early in search of her will not grow weary in the quest, for he will fi nd her seated at his door”?53 However that may be, creative Imagination may work wonders, indeed!Sensuous Aspects of Sophia in Some Other TheosophersGottfried Arnold (1666–1714), who exercised the pastoral ministry despite his aversion to all clergy (he believed the true Church to be the “inner Church”), is the celebrated author of An Impartial History of Churches and Heresies54 and a contemporary of Gichtel.

His book on The Mystery of the Divine Sophia or Wisdom, published in 1700 in Leipzig, is one of the central works that have been devoted to Sophia.56 Although he appears to have been preaching chastity and not marriage, he did marry in 1701, one year after the publication of his book. This decision may have been one of the reasons why Gichtel wrote in 1708 that Arnold “had not understood Sophia.”57Although Arnold did not claim that Sophia ever appeared to him, he is lavish in his descriptions of a sophianic wedding in terms of amorous experience, thereby drawing much upon the Song of Songs. We are informed by him that her kisses and sweet manifestations are likely to help us forget about looking for other human love relationships.58 He tells us how, in a “cabinet of Love,” we can celebrate our wedding with that bride, who is also a mother.59 The poems are replete with sensuous evocations.

Jane Leade was granted an appari-tion of the Divine Wisdom in April 1670, and this reoccurred several times subsequently. The fi rst time Sophia appeared almost as she had 61 “Umfass und ziehe dich in mich [. . .] Mein schatz, mein licht, mein auffenthalt, mein gantzes ich, mein süsses leben/Mein himmel, mein Paradies, und spiel, mein Buhler” (Arnold, Das Geheimnis, 117). Many other examples could be adduced, notably in some passages in prose, when he writes, for example: “In ihrer gantzen Beywohnung ist reine wollust. Nimmermehr kan eine irdische braut einem manne geschmückter/keuscher/züchtiger und anmuthiger vorkommen/als diese hochgelobte jungfrau. Ja es ist nicht die geringste Vergleichung zwischen beyden in diesem falle. Es ist auch nur ein Schatte/was einer sonst davon sagen kann/und was etwa nach dem Hohenliede [. . .] in einigen poetischen gedancken eröffnet” (Arnold, Das Geheimnis, 113). (“In her own vicinity is pure delight. Never will a man receive an earthly bride more tasteful, chaster, more modest, and lovelier (more graceful) than this highly praised virgin. Indeed, there is not the slightest comparison between them in this case. It is also only a shadow of what one otherwise can say, and of what the Song of Solomon reveals in poetic thought.” Translation, Versluis, Wisdom’s Book, 122). Among similar passages, see Arnold, Das Geheimnis, 119 (and the English translation, Versluis, Wisdom’s Book, 126).62 Dealing with the infl uence of Boehme in the English literature of the seventeenth century, Wilhelm Struck had already noted the presence of a “sensory mysticism” (Gefühlsmystik) that led the theosophers in the wake of Boehme into “the realm of the erotic” (Struck, Der Einfl uss J. Boehmes, 137–139. Quoted by Gibbons, Gender, 18). Addi-tionally, Willy Temme has described how the idea of the divine Sophia in Böhme’s work was transformed through its English reception in John Pordage and Jane Leade. He has argued that in Leade particularly, Sophia assumed dynamic new associations with mother, womb, rebirth, thus taking on a less metaphysical, more and more embodied sense, which was transmitted to the radical Pietists in Germany, notably Eva von Buttlar (1670–1721). Around 1700, Eva founded in Allendorf an der Werra the Christian and Philadelphian Society, aimed—among other things—at fostering the restoration of the original androgyny of mankind. It counted about seventy members; she claimed that two of them were among the three earthly representatives of the Trinity: Justus Gottfried Winter and Johann Georg Appenfeller as respectively God the Father, and the Son—and she, who was Sophia herself, and/or the second Eve (as Jesus Himself was the second Adam). The fact that a physical union with “Mother Eva” (Eva von Buttlar) was supposed to be part of the practices of the Society brought it into disrepute among several pietist movements of the time (Temme, Krise der Leiblichkeit; for Eva’s views concerning Sophia as compared to those of Leade, Pordage, Gichtel and Johann Willhelm Petersen, see sub-chapter “Der Kontext: Sophia und Eva”, 311–335)."},{"pageNumber":316,"pageContent":" sensuous relation with sophia in christian theosophy 293to Gichtel, “in the midst of a most bright cloud.” At fi rst she did not become Jane’s bride but promised to become her “natural mother”:Behold! I am God’s Eternal Virgin Wisdom, whom thou hast been enquir-ing after: I am to unseal the treasures of God’s deep Wisdom unto thee, and will be, as Rebecca was to Jacob, a true natural mother; for out of my womb thou shalt be brought forth after the manner of a spirit, being conceived and born again.63But she was called upon to become Jane’s bride as well:[ Having seen] the lustrous Presentation of her perfect Comeliness and Beauty into one Spirit I was all infl amed, making complaint, bemoaning our selves, how we might possibly compass the obtaining this matchless Virgin-Dove for our Spouse and Bride, who with her piercing fi ery Arrow of Love, had us wounded so deep, as no Cure throughout the Circumfer-ence of this lower Sphere could be found.64And Jane seems to have indulged in some sort of a sensual fantasy when she wrote, for example, how she grasped “with love-violence, this my fair, wise, rich and noble Bride [ Wisdom].”65 Sophia likewise appeared to John Pordage, the greatest representative of the theosophical cur-rent in England, who devoted a whole book to Sophia (interestingly, his Sophia was published in 1699 in Amsterdam). He too stressed the nuptial character that her relationship with the Son, the Holy Spirit, and humans takes on.66A fl urry of debates over Sophia took place at the end of the eighteenth century, notably between the French Louis-Claude de Saint-Martin (the “Unknown Philosopher,” 1743–1803) of Paris, the German Karl von Eckartshausen (1752–1803) of Munich, and the French and German speaking Niklaus Anton Kirchberger (1739–1799)—a Swiss from Bern who enthused over Boehme and Gichtel. In his correspondence with Karl von Eckartshausen (in German) and Saint-Martin (in French), Kirchberger tried to make a distinction between two different, albeit 63 Leade, The Laws of Paradise, Preface, quoted from Versluis, Wisdom’s Book, 143 (for a full description of the apparition, see 143–144; a French version of the latter is in Hutin, Les disciples, 267–268.).

Either we let Sophia’s presence manifest itself in a way that is purely “interior” (within our soul only), or we experience her in a way that is “exterior”—in which case our senses (and by the same token, occasional forms of erotic sensuality) concretely come into play.When writing to Eckartshausen about Sophia, Kirchberger occasion-ally dwelt on the “exterior” aspect. He mentioned, for example, the “great magical law” according to which “desire,” along with “imagination,”engender “substance.”67 Indeed, Sophia herself endeavors to establish an exterior—physical—rapport with us, to the point of letting herself be “embraced”—hugged. Bearing in mind the testimonies he had read in Gichtel’s Theosophia Practica and in Jane Leade’s works—about whom Eckartshausen and Kirchberger also exchanged ideas—he wrote to his correspondent in Munich: “Have no doubt about her manifestations [. . .]. On this matter, documents are extant upon which no impartial seeker may cast doubt.” When our creative (magical) Imagination is active, he added, Sophia sometimes lets her rays of love fall upon us and she may eventually unveil herself entirely, so much so that her suitors can contemplate her face to face in her glorious splendor.68 But in the same exchange with Eckartshausen he insisted upon the neces-sity of fi rst seeking Sophia “internally” because, he said, failing to do so would make a marriage with her impossible.69Be that as it may, Eckartshausen was not prone to dwell on the subject for a very long time. The reason was that he preferred to identify Divine Wisdom with Christ,70 thereby aligning himself with the former of the two options presented in the introduction of this chapter. Kirchberger’s conversation with Saint-Martin had more potential, since for him she was a real person, and one very dear to his heart as well. In his works, Saint-Martin had already devoted many passages to Sophia—in fact, she was one of his most cherished themes.71 Several letters exchanged 67 “Es existiert mein theurer Freund, ein grosses magisches Gesetz, das Dispositif davon heist, Begehren, Lust und imagination machen Substanz und Wesenheit, jedes eifrige Begehren nach ihr [Sophia], komt von ihr her” (Kirchberger to Eckartshausen, 7 November 1797, in Briefwechsel, 316).68 See Sophiana XVI.69 “Sophia, ihre Hand, ihre Ehlichung, ihre Leitung, die Mittheilung ihrer Weisheit, ihren Schutz, ihre Einführung in die pneumatische Welt, sind die gesegneten Folgen davon” (Kirchberger to Eckartshausen, 7 November 1797, in Briefwechsel, 313).70 On this matter, see Faivre, Eckartshausen, 317–318.71 For a good overview, see Jacques-Chaquin, “Sophia.”"},{"pageNumber":318,"pageContent":" sensuous relation with sophia in christian theosophy 295between Saint-Martin and Kirchberger bear on Jane Leade and John Pordage and show how successfully the Swiss prompted his French cor-respondent to read some works written by these English theosophers. Kirchberger also sang the praises to Saint-Martin of Arnold’s Mystery of the Divine Sophia, although he added that the Divine Wisdom did not appear to Arnold as tangibly as to Gichtel. In Arnold’s book he appreci-ated both the aspects—“interior” and “exterior”—of sophianic mani-festations.72 Furthermore, in a long letter Kirchberger sent a detailed account of the “personal” relation between Sophia and Gichtel. This report is based upon his reading of Theosophia Practica and does not omit the most sensuous passages of that book. He had no doubt about the authenticity of these narratives.73 Saint-Martin lent an attentive ear to the lavish descriptions offered by the Swiss. He responded that he felt “enraptured” by the details, going as far as to write: “Everything here bears the stamp of truth.”74In addition, Saint-Martin revealed to his correspondent that in respect to celibacy, his own story was similar to Gichtel’s. He believed that he too had known Gichtel’s bride, although “not as particularly as that theosopher [Gichtel] did.”75 Indeed, Saint-Martin’s letters are lacking almost completely in “sensuous” elements. That did not deter Kirchberger, however, from insisting on the sophianic “exterior” mani-festations. In particular, he mentioned Sophia’s editorial competence, broadcasting the story that she came to dwell in Überfeld’s house with a view to help him order and supervise the arrangement of Gichtel’s posthumous letters. During these visits, the Swiss explained, she busied 72 Kirchberger to Saint-Martin, 25 July 1792, in Correspondance (2004), 25–26.

Tout y porte le cachet de la vérité” (Saint-Martin to Kirchberger, 19 November 1794, in Correspondance [2004], 195).75 See Sophiana XVI; it is in the same letter that he gives a narrative of the spiritual experience which induced him to remain a bachelor."},{"pageNumber":319,"pageContent":"296 antoine faivreherself with renovating several passages which were unclear for a period of about six weeks during which “a continuous feast” also was on the agenda. Therefore she was, or so Kirchberger argued after Überfeld, in great measure responsible for the good quality of the edition of Theosophia practica.76Sensuous love between Sophia and theosophers does not seem to be much documented after the end of the eighteenth century, with one notable exception: Sophia occupies a pre-eminent place in Franz von Baader (1765–1841), the most outstanding theosopher in the fi rst half of the nineteenth century. He considered the exercise of our creative, “magical” Imagination as highly instrumental in preparing the “dress of our bride” (Brautkleid)—that is, of the Divine Wisdom—with a view to make her habitation within us possible. But he did not hold that she tends toward a form of actual incarnation.77 The sensuous aspect of companionship with Sophia seems to be totally absent from his thought and writings.Concluding RemarksWhen Divine Wisdom is considered as a real person, sophianic devotion appears as a mode of spirituality in which the notions of theosophy and mysticism stricto sensu (mysticism understood as an experience of union between God and a human being) tend to overlap, in so far as in both cases we are dealing with two entities, divine and human. Moreover, the term Brautmystik, or “bridal mysticism,” in common use within the context of mysticism proper, may apply to both, particularly in view of the feminine word Braut (fi ancée)—regardless whether the subject of the experience is male or female, since in such forms of intercourse the order of the genders is easily inverted.76 See Sophiana XVIII. Of this information (mentioned above, note 52) given by Kirchberger to Saint-Martin on 10 March 1795 (in Correspondance [2004], 208) I have found no trace in Th. P. (i.e., neither in Gichtel’s letters, nor in vol. 7, Gichtel’s biogra-phy by Überfeld; but the relevant passage may simply have passed me by.

This trait resonates with two of the main aspects of theosophical literature: fi rst, the focus on mediations (divine entities are mediations par excellence); and second, the importance of the notion of incarnation as a means of supporting the idea that the various levels of reality are linked together in a continuous chain of being. Given the second characteristic, it comes as no surprise that among those theosophers who felt they were experiencing the presence of Sophia within themselves, some evinced a tendency to “incarnate” her to the point of seeing in her a person with whom a bond not only amorous but also—up to a certain point—sensuous was possible. Conversely, theosophers like Baader, of a less “experiential” and more “speculative” orientation, were understandably less prone to develop such a form of sensuality in their relationship with the Divine Wisdom.SophianaIt has seemed appropriate to complement this contribution by a sec-tion presenting some quotations from original texts particularly rel-evant to the subject.

Marriage is divinely ordained, and the union of God and the church stands as the ideal union to which humans should aspire. Reporting from his mystical visits to a heaven resonating with Neoplatonic overtones in which the lower and higher worlds mirror each other, Swedenborg’s writings intimate that the image of God is reproduced in the mating couple, a recreation of the primal androgyne, when male and female he created them.1 Caught between the repre-sentation of the genders as dual and of married love as a single entity, Swedenborg recapitulates his contemporary and later infl uential distress about whether to see love through binary oppositions or as a process of achieving wholeness. The confl ict of how to perceive conjugal love continued, in Swedenborg’s legacy, in his pervasive infl uence on the American renaissance.Swedenborg’s writings were the primary theological touchstone for the American articulation of Spiritualism, a religious movement begun in 1848 and characterized by some contemporary scholars as the more exoteric branch of American hermeticism.2 Modeling their ideas on 1 There has been a great deal of scholarly speculation about the infl uence of the kabbalah on Swedenborg’s thinking; while it is clear that Swedenborg would have access to both Jewish and Christian kabbalistic writings, it remains speculative whether he was indeed infl uenced at all by kabbalah. In “Emanuel Swedenborg, the Jews, and Jewish Tradition,” Wouter Hanegraaff concludes that there has not yet been proven any direct connection between Jewish writing and Swedenborg’s thought. Furthermore, according to Hanegraaff, any resemblances can be more aptly accounted for by the more general transmission of Neoplatonic ideas.2 All thoughtful commentators on Spiritualism question the precise “creation” of this movement, since phenomenologically similar events had been happening in Europe and America since time immemorial.

With the telegraph, photography, and later the telephone providing instant and invisible communication across space, Spiritualists simply noted that space went up to heaven as well as across to the territories. With refi nements on the Mesmeric trance state, mediums (most often women) became the living instrument of communication between the living and the dead. And like contemporaneous discussions of electric-ity, Spiritualists held their discovery to be scientifi cally true, even if not yet well understood.Contact with the dead disclosed that heaven resembled the famil-iar landscapes of earth, with neighborhoods, churches, schools, and social occasions, in essence a sanitized version of the ethos of the time. The dead participated in the fascination with technology as well as the burgeoning populism of the new middle class, and like many contemporaneous religious movements both Spiritualists and the spirits refl ected a cultural celebration of the ideals of democracy. Spiritualism proposed that people retained all of their individual characteristics at death and therefore wished to maintain their relationships with those on earth. The spirits of the dead also retained their earthly fl aws and were not made perfect upon entrance to heaven, but rather were subject to errors and mistakes in the afterlife.Spiritualists were also notable for espousing progressive and fre-quently radical political reforms on nearly every front. In addition to their important contributions to Abolition and women’s rights, they also embraced a wide gamut of liberal platforms, from improving the condition of prisons to relatively arcane calls for phonetic spelling and more congenial underwear. As Ann Braude has ably demonstrated, Spiritualism also sounded the death knell for wide-spread American Calvinism and particularly its policies of infant damnation.3 By provid-ing grieving mothers with what was understood to be empirical proof of the continued existence of their children in heaven, the movement and theological claims the Spiritualists made. For a discussion of Spiritualism as the “exoteric” branch of the occult “church” in America, see Godwin, The Theosophical Enlightenment, Chapter Ten, especially 188. Both Versluis and Godwin give some cre-dence to the later claims by more hard-line occultists that Spiritualism was seeded or perhaps even masterminded by occult adepts to prepare society for future hermetic truths.

Its teleology of both individuals and “tribes and races” was coterminous with progress and education. Hence, Spiritual-ism dispensed entirely with the concept of hell, arguing instead that misdeeds stemming from poverty and ignorance should not be equated with evil. Women in particular seem to have cherished the banishment of hell as a hallmark of the new religiosity. Cora Hatch, arguably the most famous medium of her day, joined such august women as Emma Hardinge Britten when she announced that “evil is a word that should be cast out of every vocabulary; for it does not follow that because the fi nite can not equal the infi nite, it is evil. In our opinion, the fi nite comprehension of good is all the evil that exists, and as men’s understanding enlarges, so will their ideas of goodness increase.”4 By positioning good and evil as a scale of knowledge rather than a set of polarities of sin and salvation, Hatch and others proposed universal inclusion in heaven. Life was not a one-time testing ground but rather a preamble for a long and continuing education. The spirits of the dead could repent, learn, and improve in the afterlife and thereby move forward to moral perfection after their deaths.The dead, then, much like those who were expending their ener-gies in communicating with them, were upwardly mobile. Unlike their contemporary Huck Finn’s idea of heaven, where angels reclined on clouds (striking Huck as enormously dull), the Spiritualist heaven was alive with motion. The dead went to school, grew up in spirit bodies, met, fell in love, got married, even occasionally had spirit children. Expanding on Swedenborg’s tripartite heaven, the Spiritualist heaven was depicted as usually having seven spheres, with the dead advanc-ing toward perfection as they increased their spiritual knowledge. The synchronic element of heaven was not lost on the Spiritualists, and the famous dead were routinely called upon to give advice to the living. Spiritualism thus alleviated grieving on the personal level and buttressed its own cultural privileging of progress by having the wise and powerful dead advocate liberal reform. With progress as the hallmark of both life and the afterlife, Spiritualism held out salvifi c hope for all.

Thus, the radical continuity between heaven and earth proposed by Spiritualists held true as well in matters of love. For the majority of Spiritualists, the ideals of love that may be read obliquely through communications with the dead were largely those shared by the white, Protestant, bourgeois main-stream. American ideas of love during the Victorian epoch strongly affi rmed the cultural centrality of marriage and legitimated sex—and even desire—within that context. However, as Steven Seidman has argued, as pragmatic and economic buttresses for marriage increas-ingly receded in the nineteenth century, a spiritualized version of love took their place. Guided by monogamy and promoting both health and reproduction, marriage and sex were laudable to the extent that they were controlled.5If Spiritualists departed from their contemporaries in any generalized sense, it was only in betraying the frequency with which marriage failed to meet their own high expectations. Marriage was upheld as such a profound ideal that the majority of humans lacked the wherewithal to succeed at it, at least in earthly life. The desirability of love, marriage, and sexual union were all affi rmed by Spiritualists, arguably more vig-orously than by society at large. Sex existed in heaven but usually did not produce offspring, thereby eliminating the moralizing tendencies of much non-Spiritualist writing that posited procreation as the only justifi cation for the sex act.6 The importance of love was governed by the free will of two equal individuals rather than measured by the economic or procreative outcomes of such a union. For Spiritualists, the union itself was the unit of value both on earth and in the afterlife.5 Seidman, Romantic Longings, 40–50.6 I have never seen a reference to homosexuality in Spiritualist writings, other than as a vague threat, in the Free Love fringe movement, that homosexuality will be the result of sexual misconduct. There are no instances of same-sex love or condemnation of that love in heaven that I have come across. It is possible that this was just too far off the middle-class radar to enter the record, or it is equally possible that the idea of proto-homosexuality would have been so threatening to their lack of hell that it was merely ignored. Seidman confi rms that this remarkable silence is the norm across Protestant and medical discourses of the era (Seidman, Romantic Longings, 22)."},{"pageNumber":336,"pageContent":" deadly dates: bodies and sex in spiritualist heavens 313Love and eros were intrinsic parts of life and death, and I will argue that Spiritualism denied the supremacy of the soul over the body as well as other concomitant Enlightenment dualisms that privileged one term of an opposition at the cost of the second. First, however, I will examine Swedenborg’s writings on love and marriage for their infl uence on Spiritualist understanding. Then I will trace the varieties of sex in Spiritualist heavens and argue that this esoteric movement refused to sacrifi ce the body on the altar of the soul.Swedenborg on SexA Herodotus of the heavens, Swedenborg reported his mystical jaunts to the afterlife as a travelogue, and one curiously devoid of the author’s own editorializing or any sense of awe. Without any comment, Sweden-borg announces that heavenly marriages are strictly among those who are consociated, implying that most earthly marriages are dissolved in heaven but that the right person will indeed be found in the afterlife. In his most widely read work, Heaven and Hell, the reader learns that the union of man and woman in marriage is tantamount to the union of the good and the true, and this radical metaphoricity inheres in a series of complements; binary attractions between the will and understand-ing, between heaven and the Word, and between God and the church are added to the original. True conjugal love, such as exists in heaven, cannot be rent, since doing so would be the microcosmic equivalent of tearing the very fabric of the relationship with the divine asunder.7On the contrary, bad conjugal love, which is apparently rife, is the marriage of the false with the evil and is characterized as “adultery.” Swedenborg writes:[ T ]he pleasure of adultery is essentially nothing but the pleasure of a love of the union of what is false and what is evil. This is a hellish pleasure, because it is diametrically opposed to the pleasure of heaven, which is the pleasure of a love of what is true united to the good.8The attraction between the false and the evil is the chief metaphor for the inhabitants of hell, and the series of binary oppositions (true/false, 7 Swedenborg, Heaven and Hell, section 374.8 Ibid., section 384."},{"pageNumber":337,"pageContent":"314 cathy gutierrezgood/evil) are complemented by the series of binary attractions (false/evil, good/true, will/understanding).In 1768 Swedenborg undertook what is possibly his longest mystical refl ection on marriage and its religious primacy. Currently translated as Love in Marriage, this work enumerates the absolute centrality of the union of souls on earth if one is lucky and in heaven for eternity. As he had in Heaven and Hell ten years earlier, Swedenborg reports on the conditions of heaven from visionary experience and gives straight-forward, pragmatic advice for the living with the superior cultures of heaven acting as his ideal model. Completely ignoring the confl icting injunctions to celibacy in the New Testament, Swedenborg’s heavenly informants claim that marriage pervades all of creation from angels to worms and that sexual love is the concrete expression of the union of the masculine good and the feminine truth.9Married sexuality is thus not a necessary affl iction, but rather a celebrated condition of union. His discussion of sex, as distinct from procreation, is explicit, and one learns that married male angels can never be impotent, and therefore their sense of sexual pleasure remains constant eternally.10 The book is a minute dissection of marriage and sexuality on an encyclopedic scope, ranging from the proper engage-ment period to the misdeeds of adulterers, rapists, and lovers of sexual variety. Swedenborg explains that having a concubine is a sin (unless one is separated), and that chilly or superfi cial marriages on earth are preferable to divorce since they produce children and placate one’s parents.11 Polygamy is dealt with in detail as a lascivious error, but if practitioners live by the word of God, these “Mohammedans” will only be punished for this trespass by being separated from the Christians in the afterlife. In both its tone and scope, Love in Marriage stands as a sweeping, emotional, and extremely hopeful disquisition on relations between the genders and the primary importance of these relationships in religious life.Marriage abides in heaven, adultery in hell, and both are marked by a system of correspondence in which like attracts like, whether it is good or evil. Emanuel Swedenborg was a man perched precariously between two worlds, not only heaven and hell, but also the Renaissance and 9 Swedenborg, Love in Marriage, sections 90 and 92.10 Ibid., section 355.11 Ibid., 332, 463, and 276."},{"pageNumber":338,"pageContent":" deadly dates: bodies and sex in spiritualist heavens 315the Enlightenment. As Wouter Hanegraaff has argued, Swedenborg’s system of correspondences refl ects this awkward historical moment of negotiating the classical esoteric worldview, in which the world stands in divine refl ection of the cosmos, and Cartesian dualism that implies a hierarchy of the divine and material, soul and body, God and man. Hanegraaff writes:From this perspective, Swedenborg’s doctrine of correspondences emerges as an impoverished version of the esoteric original, in the sense that it retains only the “vertical” dimension of heavenly archetype versus natural refl ection, and, as a result, reintroduces an element of dualism which posits the superiority of spirit over matter. . . . It should be noted that Cartesian dualism is combined in Swedenborg’s mind with a traditional Christian emphasis on renouncing the things of this world for the sake of heaven.12Swedenborg’s writings on conjugal love participate in this confusion, advocating simultaneously that the body mirrors the universe, a Renais-sance ideal of man being the microcosm of the divine, and that the use of the body in marriage is radically bifurcated into dualisms that map onto heaven and hell. In the fi nal analysis, it is the latter construction that governs Swedenborg’s discussions of erotic love, although he does suggest that the binary opposition of male and female can be resolved in the farthest reaches of divine love when the two become as one.Bad Sex in HeavenIn the years prior to the Civil War, perhaps the most infl uential Spir-itualist was Judge John Edmonds of the New York State Supreme Court. Judge Edmonds and his circle represent the upper echelons of Spiritualist society, and his séances were regularly attended by the intelligentsia of the epoch. Edmonds, along with his friend Dr. George Dexter, compiled a two-volume magnum opus on communications with the spirit world. These are verbatim transcriptions of spirit circles or the reproduction of automatic writing that took place during them. The dynamics between the living and the dead are quite telling in this elite circle, and Judge Edmonds is frequently visited by illustrious company such as Francis Bacon and Swedenborg. These sorts of spirits deliver high-fl own speeches on lofty topics, ranging from the constitution of 12 Hanegraaff, New Age Religion, 427–428."},{"pageNumber":339,"pageContent":"316 cathy gutierrezthe solar system to the uses of electricity and the true defi nitions for concepts like love and justice.However, the judge and his friends also set out to help the spirits on the lowest rung of heaven; the fact that the living are in a position to give spiritual advice to those in heaven attests to the theological dif-fi culties of banishing hell. In 1853, the judge and his coterie spent a couple of weeks communicating almost exclusively with the spirits in the fi rst sphere. These were reported as harrowing experiences, with circle members frequently afraid of physical harm from the spirits that overtook the medium’s body. The medium herself was understood to be at mortal risk if the sessions lasted too long, and with some regularity the safety of the circle required that Bacon or Swedenborg step in and protect them from attacks from these heavenly creatures.The lowest rung of heaven is a vile deathscape, with gutted buildings, smoldering fi res, and gangs of criminals wandering around looking for trouble. Children and animals are beaten to the perverse delight of on-lookers, and every form of torture is employed by spirits on one another. Since the dead cannot die, torture results in the spirit body suffering until the brink of death and then a protracted reenactment of the fi nal moment ensues. Miserable souls perpetrate cruel acts on others in a barren landscape, resulting in a heaven that is indistinguish-able from most concepts of hell except that it has no devil-character overseeing the administration of suffering.It was here, in the lowliest heaven, that the judge went to help the needy. In the context of the séance, he was given a series of visions, some of which he could only watch, while in others he was able to interact with the dead. When he found a spirit who seemed ready to repent and move on, he helped in any way that he could. Most, however, were intractable in their love of baseness, mocking him or worse. It is on this rung of heaven that we encounter the limits of sex—lascivious-ness, adultery, and prostitution. It would appear that depraved sexuality cannot be consummated in heaven and exists alongside violence and pain. In one description of a woman who seems to be a prostitute (her face is “painted” and she has “bedizened her bed with curtains!”), he recounts:At length a man in passing turned aside, under the infl uence of passions which had marked his earthly career, and with her entered her house. I saw them both infl uenced by the same passions, but were incapable of satisfying them. The woman became furious. She raved wildly, and in her insensate rage she dashed the things around her to pieces. The"},{"pageNumber":340,"pageContent":" deadly dates: bodies and sex in spiritualist heavens 317man enjoyed her anger and she raged at him for laughing at her. She seized a chair and aimed a blow at him. He evaded it, and with his fi st knocked her down. He struck her in the neck just below the chin, and when she fell, he gnashed his teeth in his rage, and stamped with his foot on her breast. He kicked her in the side several times, and rushed from the house.13This ghastly scene is by no means singular in this series of communica-tions. Crime in heaven is heavily gendered; women are prone to vanity, promiscuity, prostitution, and the destruction of children. Men are guilty of drunkenness, debauchery, physical violence, torture, and murder. The principle of like attracting like is still operative in Spiritualist heavens, and the reader is told that affi nity is how souls are placed in heaven to begin with—one simply arrives in the sphere where there are like-minded spirits. Improvement, however, was the hallmark of death as well as life, and when an individual spirit stirred and recognized that progress was possible, then and only then would options begin to make themselves apparent.One of the very few stories of the lowest heaven that ends on a hopeful note is the case of an adulteress who had run off with a stage actor, deserting her husband and children and sending her parents to their grave in shame. Rather than being wanton, however, the woman is depicted as being pitiable, abused on earth by her adulterous lover and fi nally deserted by him upon entrance to heaven. In life she had been willful and misguided, but she had also been mistreated at the hands of men, and this appears to swing the scales of justice in her favor. She is also educable. Judge Edmonds approaches her, offering advice and directing her to the foothills of a mountain over which she has to laboriously walk to fi nd the second sphere. Despite her exhaus-tion, en route she saves a child from being tormented at the hands of its mother.14 And while the text never tells of a successful completion of her journey to the next sphere, later editions of the book include footnotes detailing her subsequent communications saying that while progress was grindingly slow, it was indeed happening.As mentioned above, with the absence of hell, Spiritualists frequently backed themselves into an epistemological corner with the presence of evil. The majority of Spiritualist writing simply ignores the problem of theodicy or focuses on the repentant and their efforts at reform. 13 Edmonds & Dexter, Spiritualism, 182–183.14 Ibid., 189."},{"pageNumber":341,"pageContent":"318 cathy gutierrezI propose that this unusual lingering on improper erotics in heaven is predicated on a shift in the quasi-Protestant understanding of the misuse of sexuality: bad sex is not a sin, but it is a crime. The key, I argue, is not to read improper sex against normative sex, but rather against the unlikely matter of prison reform.Judge Edmonds presided over a criminal court and approached the lowest rung of heaven as a judge rather than a theologian. When encountering spirits of the dead who had been hanged for crimes on earth, Edmonds even found himself in the curious position of having to ask if he himself had sent the man to the gallows! Long after this sojourn into the bottom of heaven, the reader learns that the judge had been appointed the chief administrator of a New York state prison. Edmonds was concerned by the use of corporal punishment by the guards but found himself reluctant to attend a whipping session. One day, he stumbled upon one about to take place. The prisoner looks pleadingly at the judge for reprieve, and when none is forthcoming, says defi antly, “Whip away! It ain’t the fi rst time. It has never done me any good yet, and won’t now.” The judge responds promptly, “Then take him down. He knows best what will do him good.”15 The remainder of the scene reads astonishingly like Pinel freeing the madmen of their chains at the asylum in Bicêtre and bringing enlightenment to the dark corners of the medieval understanding of insanity. The kindness shown by Edmonds results in the man promptly becoming the model prisoner; he is polite, restrained, contrite, and, one learns, suffering from a disease that causes insanity, so in the end, he is not even morally culpable.Spiritualists conceived of improper sexuality as a crime created by poverty, ignorance, and social injustice, rather than an ontological state of sin. As a crime, the root causes of bad sexuality could be fer-reted out and cured. As a heavily gendered crime, society’s victims—women—could be understood to be pitiable rather than contemptible. The women who are depicted as prostitutes and adulterers in heaven have been harmed at the hands of violent, inconstant men who dupe and deceive them into crime. Apparent evil is a lack of knowledge or opportunity that results in crime, not sin. The binary opposition of good and evil gets broken with that of heaven and hell, thereby denying that marriage and adultery, in Swedenborg’s terms, or even proper and improper sexuality could also be mutually opposed.

Bad sex is not destined for hell, but rather for improvement.Middling Sex in HeavenAs Mary Ryan has argued in her seminal work, The Cradle of the Middle Class, the emergence of a white-collar stratum of society indelibly shifted gender roles and consequently contributed to a cultural fascination with romantic love. Ryan argues that the creation of a middle class, in which men worked outside of the home and the home itself stopped being the site of producing food or wares, undercut the overt economic benefi ts of marriage, casting monogamy in a search for a new identity. As marital bonds became less tangible and more tenuous, the middle class responded with a wholesale embrace of romantic love.16 Marriage, stripped of its utilitarian purposes, would be elevated to much loftier heights and much higher expectations—those of true love.Spiritualists certainly participated in the fetishization of marriage and highlighting of the importance of romantic love. As reform-minded progressives, however, Spiritualists also recognized that a good num-ber of earthly marriages were unhappy and unhealthy, often trapping women and children in dangerous situations and turning them once again into victims. Rather than wishing to eliminate marriage, however, Spiritualists proposed that it was so important that it could barely be entrusted to the living at all. In the hands of the Spiritualists, true marriage became nearly entirely an affair of the dead.Adherents forwarded the idea of “spiritual affi nities,” which posited that souls are coupled divinely and eternally, but that there is no guar-antee one will fi nd one’s mate while alive. The spirit of Franz Petersilea spoke for the majority of believers when he responded that marriage was desirable but contingent while on earth, but that in heaven it was eternal. He communicates:Soul-mating is not so much for earth as it is for heaven, and people on earth do not, as yet, understand the law. They marry when quite ignorant and youthful—they marry after the fl esh and beget children after the fl esh, but they pass on and leave their fl eshly bodies behind—they are no more of the fl esh but of the spirit—and now commences a higher and 16 See Ryan, Cradle of the Middle Class, chapter four."},{"pageNumber":343,"pageContent":"320 cathy gutierrezbetter education; but, thousands on earth are, through natural attraction, really, although ignorantly, united to their own true other self. These will always remain together as one, for they are one; but thousands more are not, and these will be released on leaving the body, to be properly united to the true counterpart.17Petersilea’s assessment of the situation—that most earthly marriages are of the middling sort—appears to have been largely agreed upon by living believers. While many Spiritualist tracts discuss the importance of romantic love and express the longed for hope of fi nding one’s affi nity while on earth, the majority that I have found actually express the inverse—the unhappily, or tediously, married on earth may rest assured that their situation is temporary and that it will be rectifi ed in heaven.Spiritualists pitted the perfect marriage of heaven against the imper-fect ones on earth in order to sound the call to change divorce law in America. In 1862, the New York-based Spiritualist weekly, The Herald of Progress, ran an article written by a Mrs. Jane R. Griffi ng. Mrs. Griffi ng’s call for marriage reform enumerates two basic tenets of Spiritualist rhetoric on the subject: fi rst, earth is but the poor simulacrum of heaven, and therefore comparisons between the two provide an unassailable example of what is ultimately right and good.18 That is, even if people are not instantly perfected at death, heaven’s cultural practices are superior to those of the living and can serve as heavenly chastisement for earthly missteps. Secondly, it is the responsibility of those alive to usher in as progressive a future as possible, and bad marriages concretely hamper the future by producing bad children. She writes:Among the many wrongs that exist in society, there are none that are so fraught with evil as those that receive the sanction and protection of our marriage laws—none so effi ciently shielded by custom and so diffi cult to reach with the probing knife of Reform. They are hedged about by all our traditional opinions, by all the passional selfi shness of mankind . . . preferring that [the problem] remain festering in the heart 17 Petersilea, Letters from the Spirit World, 161–162.18 Most scholars either do not notice or else do not fi nd it interesting that, rather than having heaven be a projection of earth (as scholarship frequently characterizes it, and for good reason), for the Spiritualists, earth was a poor copy of heaven. One of the few exceptions to this is the on-line Ephemera project, the author of which rightly notes that earth is a second-rate imitation of heaven and that it exists in a temporally later state than heaven which has progressed far beyond it. See http://www.spirithistory.com/invent.html for details."},{"pageNumber":344,"pageContent":" deadly dates: bodies and sex in spiritualist heavens 321of humanity, poisoning the life springs of childhood and embittering the whole lives of many noble men and women.19Mrs. Griffi ng opines that even married people do not recommend the institution to each other and long for the days of being single; she refers to marriage as a “whited sepulchre” and calls for the happy day when marriage might be as it is in heaven. That condition, however, is predicated on easier access to divorce to be able to shed false marriage in search of a true one.At the fringes of Spiritualist society (about which I will say more later), marriage, like deviant sexual expressions, needs to be read against thinking about crime. The leftist branch of the already leftist Spiritual-ists advocated the dissolution of marriage altogether as the economic disparity between fi nancially independent men and dependent women resulted in what they argued was a legally sanctioned but unsavory practice—prostitution. Amanda Frisken argues,In advocating social and economic remedies for prostitution, sex radicals went beyond a demand for the vote. By referring to marriage as legal prostitution, they insisted that both groups of women exchanged sexuality for material benefi t, but men held up married women as exemplary, and disparaged the prostitutes they secretly visited.20Thus, even the middling sex of married people is a crime and women are its victims. And while not all Spiritualists would have agreed with such a radical determination of the essence of earthly marriage, they would almost certainly have been familiar with such rhetoric and were at a minimum sympathetic to the plight that marriage could present, particularly for women.If one’s marriage on earth were unsatisfactory, however, heaven held the promise of rectifying that. Letters from Astrea, a series of communi-cations through the prolifi c medium Mrs. Mary T. Longley, contains dialogues between the spirit Astrea and her earthly soul mate, who remains nameless. The reader becomes aware, through the questions asked and the answers received, that the unidentifi ed supplicant is married and has a family with his earthly wife. The preface to the text includes a disclaimer about why the unnamed man has agreed to publish such personal material:19 Herald of Progress, May 17, 1862.20 Frisken, Victoria Woodhull’s Sexual Revolution, 27."},{"pageNumber":345,"pageContent":"322 cathy gutierrezHe also wishes it to be known that the principal reason for his consenting to the publication of these, to him, sacred messages is the hope that they may give comfort and encouragement to such as have not experienced the bliss of a congenial married life, or even any married life; and also the knowledge that sometime and somewhere this blissful fruition will be realized.21While presumably the living man is comforted by communications with his intended, Astrea details her own sufferings without him in heaven. The reader learns that she is denied access to heavenly temples of the highest teachings reserved for coupled souls. Astrea explains,In Spiritual Worlds woman has all the privileges and rights vouchsafed to, or inherent in, man. Yet there are studies that neither can pursue separately: there are Temples of Revelation, that no man, no woman, can grace or enter independently; each must be accompanied by his or her Soul Mate—the two making up the One Being, Soul Completeness.22Progress, the hallmark of heaven itself, was slowed or halted for Astrea who was waiting for her love to die. In the middle spheres of heaven, affi nities between souls righted the mismatched marriages of earth and ensured that true love extends beyond being coupled; it makes one whole.Platonic Love ReconsideredErotic love in its proper context overcame binary dualisms and created a whole out of the misleading appearance of duality of genders. In heaven, good love overcomes the separation of the sexes and reunites the lost halves of a single androgynous being. Resonances from Plato’s Symposium are implicit and explicit in these discussions. The Spiritual-ists, however, side not with Diotima and her rather cold metaphysical truths, but instead with Aristophanes and his gleeful tale of desire. According to the Platonic Aristophanes, the world was once peopled with a race of spherical beings who were so powerful that they chal-lenged the gods. To prevent further trouble, Zeus sliced the spheres, thereby creating eros:21 Anonymous, Letters from Astrea, 4 (non-sequential numbering between reprinted pieces).22 Anonymous, Letters from Astrea, 35."},{"pageNumber":346,"pageContent":" deadly dates: bodies and sex in spiritualist heavens 323Now, since the natural form of human beings was cut in two, each half longed for the other. So, out of their desire to grow together, they would throw their arms around each other when they met and become entwined. . . . Love collects the halves of our original nature, and tries to make a single thing out of the two parts so as to restore our natural condition. Thus, each of us is the matching half of a human being, since we have been severed like a fl atfi sh, two coming from one, and each part is always seeking its other half.23The Spiritualists indeed believed that love not only collected the halves of their natures, but also reunited the halves of their bodies.In one of the more interesting farragoes on this topic, the learned Spiritualist Edward Carpenter traces the cause of erotic desire back-wards not through historical time but through evolutionary time. He begins with the single-cell reproduction of the protozoa as a primal memory of being severed from one’s half. This sensation governs attendant behaviors on higher evolutionary planes and accounts for why the sperm instinctively knows how to physically conjoin with the egg. On a cellular level, he argues, we reenact the search for originary wholeness: “Not ‘fertilization’ but ‘fusion’ is the key word of the [con-ception] process. The mystical conception, as old as Plato, of the male and female as representing respectively the two halves of a complete being, turns out to be no poetic metaphor. As regards the essential features of reproduction, it is a literal fact.”24 From the microscopic to the transcendent, bodies wish to be united.The Spiritualists ran the gamut in terms of being willing to openly discuss sexuality. The question of whether there was physical sex in heaven was frequently posed in spirit circles, and the most popular reply was “sort of.” The gross materialities of earth did not translate well into the middle spheres of heaven, and any carnal taint to love was unthinkable.25 However, that did not preclude the possibility that true love could and should be expressed sexually. Sexuality was written 23 Plato, Symposium, 191b–191d. I am quoting the translation by William Cobb in his Erotic Dialogues, 30.24 Carpenter, The Drama of Love and Death, 18.25 This problem gets worse the higher up the spheres one goes, since spirit bodies (usually) become increasingly ephemeral; spirits on the higher echelons are clothed in light and often consume aromas. These reaches where the tactile becomes more elusive, however, tend only to be rumored in heaven. Even the culturally vaunted dead like Shakespeare and Swedenborg only reside on the third to fi fth heavens, generally speaking, and the upper-most levels are almost never contacted directly."},{"pageNumber":347,"pageContent":"324 cathy gutierrezabout as a reunion of the primal androgyne rather than intercourse strictly speaking.The spirit of the then-recently deceased John Pierpont, active Spiri-tualist and a leader of the movement, was asked just such a question. Conducted through the mediumship of Mrs. Longley, Father Pierpont responds to a rather blunt question of whether sex continues beyond the grave. He replies with a long disquisition about the primal nature of soul mates as single in essence and but dual in gender, separated into two for the purpose of “human expression.” He communicates via automatic writing,Soul mates are always united sometime, it may not be for many, many years, according to their unfoldment and work, or knowledge in the spirit world; sometime and somewhere the union will be, of course, since the law of affi liation and attraction, as well as vibration, in the spirit, all life, or being, must fi nd its own.26The union of the two halves in heaven takes bodily as well as spiritual form. The fullness of erotic love at some distant point in the future extends beyond the emotional to a concrete and undifferentiated physi-cal unity, a veritable orb of the original Platonic androgyne. I quote at length to show the raw sexuality depicted here:The organ of generation maintains and is like a seat of life, since it, through the intelligent will and the love element, increases the fl ow (so to speak) of the magnetic aura toward the counterpart of the individual (soul mate) and causes a blending of the whole harmonious natures, not in sexual intercourse as known on earth, but in the conmingling of the auras as their atoms meet in mutual harmony and love. . . . We are told that, ultimately, in the Celestial Spheres, ages on, the reunited Soul Mates appear as one rounded Glorifi ed Sphere of Light, possessing the attributes of Intelligence, Energy, Wisdom, Love and Power; but that the distinct individual attributes and elements of each, the male and female, are plainly discerned and manifested; there is no swallowing up of either individuality by the other part; and that whenever desirable, they can separate and appear as two distinct individuals, male and female.27Sexual contact in heaven is distinctly corporeal and tangible. And while the spirits, or the Spiritualists, could not let go of the primacy of individuality, the emphasis remains on the joining of two beings into a single unit; individual expression is optional.26 Anonymous, Letters from Astrea, 64.27 Ibid., 65. The parenthetical comments are in the original."},{"pageNumber":348,"pageContent":" deadly dates: bodies and sex in spiritualist heavens 325Andrew Jackson Davis, one of the most famous Spiritualists of his day and what I would characterize as the movement’s primary theologian, was also not one to shy away from discussions of erotic love. Davis was a proponent of spiritual affi nities and at the forefront of political activ-ism for marriage reform. As a country doctor and a homeopath, Davis wrote more than most Spiritualists on the proper use of the body, and sexuality was a central example. In The Great Harmonia, Davis writes,Sex is the fundamental law of existence—that is to say, the male and female, positive and negative principles. Those who comprehend this law in its fullness hold that key which will unlock all mysteries in the world—including those of science, morals, religion, and spirituality. It is the Alpha and Omega of all production and generation.28Even this apparently ringing endorsement of sexuality, however, evades the restrictions of the binary opposition of genders, not only by creating a single entity in the sex act but also by placing erotic love on a ladder of love in which it is not at the top. Love itself is subject to improve-ment, and erotic love is on a particular rung of behavior that can be surpassed. Davis enumerates the types of love in ascending order: self-love (which is cast in a positive light as creating the individual), conjugal love, parental love, fraternal, fi lial, and fi nally universal love. This last accounts not only for love of one’s fellow beings but also love of the divine and even the soul’s curiosity, providing the impetus for progress and discovery.29For Aristophanes and his Spiritualist followers, erotic desire was a search for lost wholeness in body and soul. Later Platonists, however, would propose a more protracted and diffi cult ascent to love’s ideal, and Spiritualists were the inheritors of this legacy as well. With this, we turn from the Spiritualist conception of love as Platonic to a concep-tion of love as Neoplatonic. As the spheres of heaven extend upward toward the divine, so too do the objects of love.Free Love at the Second ComingThe Free Love movement in America is generally a misnomer, a slan-der attached to those who advocated marriage reform by those who 28 Davis, The Harmonial Philosophy, 280.29 Ibid., 278–279."},{"pageNumber":349,"pageContent":"326 cathy gutierrezdid not. While there were indeed sex radicals of the day, the majority of Spiritualists expended their energies trying to distinguish their own concern for liberal reform from the libertine fringe. A strict separa-tion of the two was ultimately doomed, however, since while not all Spiritualists were free lovers, most free lovers were in fact Spiritualists. With the caveat that this is not representative of the mainstream of Spiritualist beliefs, I will now turn to the extremes of eros advocated under the rubric of Spiritualism.30Like spiritual affi nities, free love marshaled some ideological support from Plato. The contemporaneous Oneida Community, founded by John Humphrey Noyes (studied by Arthur Versluis in the following chapter), was a long-running experimental community based on a millennialist vision of perfection implemented by a Platonic view of utopia. The community practiced what it called “complex marriage,” or the ability to have heterosexual intercourse, under certain regulations, with any other adult member of the society. And while the Oneidans occasion-ally referred to themselves as “free lovers,” in both theory and practice they were sharply distinguished from the sex radicals. The free love movement advocated any form of uncoerced heterosexual expression, including celibacy and monogamy. The Oneida Community by contrast advocated an equal distribution of love—both emotional and physi-cal—among all members of the community, and members expended an extraordinary amount of energy breaking what they called “exclusive attachments,” or the lure of romantic love.Noyes, however, was well-educated and well-read, and when the time came for the community to replenish its members, he instituted a eugenics program based on Platonic ideals in the Republic and elsewhere. His “Essay on Scientifi c Propagation” remains a deliciously shocking document, calling for the careful breeding of humans as one would show dogs. He combines Platonic eugenics with cutting-edge Darwinian theory to argue that superior spirituality is a characteristic that could be bred for as easily as long snouts or blue eyes. Plato’s rigged lottery, in which the talented people would “coincidentally” be mated with other talented people, was replaced by Noyes with applications to a committee. Thus he combined the structure and propagation of the 30 For a fascinating foray into how Horace Greeley was forced to disassociate him-self from Love Spiritualists who were ruining his reputation, see Fornell, The Unhappy Medium, 33–37.

The uses of Plato, however, extended beyond com-munity-building to justifi cations for free love by invoking the Forms. In a fascinating apologia from 1857, Austin Kent argued that Plato’s construction of the one and the many, in which a single metaphysical perfection could be instantiated in multiple ways on earth, served as the rationale for free love. In his case, Kent loves intelligence:I am, in the sense in which I am speaking, comparatively a fi xed fact in in [sic] always loving or having an affi nity for certain attributes of other human beings. I love mentality. Some minds more than others, because their mentality is more in harmony with the particular development of mine—but I can love no one mind exclusively. . . . If I love mind, to love one mind exclusively from another is impossible.32Kent, a follower of Andrew Jackson Davis’s philosophy, felt it incum-bent on himself to explain that in the lower spheres of heaven two souls are undoubtedly united, but as they progress through the spheres, non-exclusive love is implemented. In this manner, Kent graciously explained how Davis and Swedenborg could be mistaken when they advocated spiritual affi nity for couples only. As one progresses through the higher spheres of spiritual evolution, a heavenly utopia of free love emerges. Kent writes:How glorious that day! A day so long prayed for by all the pious of earth. In this heaven there will be no exclusive marriage, or giving in marriage. But we shall be as the real and higher angels. We say, let that day come! let it come! though it should overturn and overturn,—purify and sanctify,—sift and burn, in a preceding judgment, and bury in one common grave of the past, all sectarinism [sic] and all exclusive marriage, and land our race in one ocean of love and union! Let all jealously [sic] and hate go to its own place! . . . Then will the “will of God be done upon earth, as it is done in heaven.” We shall be as the angels. We have 31 For the call for human breeding, see Noyes, “Essay on Scientifi c Propagation.” There are several excellent scholarly works on this fascinating group. For one example, see Klaw, Without Sin.32 Kent, Free Love, 25.

But we do not call these angels of heaven.33Kent’s effusiveness notwithstanding, many other free lovers also relied upon the language of the New Testament in which the angels are neither married nor given in marriage to provide theological leverage for their cause. This conjunction of Spiritualism, radical sexuality, and Christian rhetoric made for some extremely odd bedfellows, including the case of that most roaring of radicals, Victoria Woodhull.A most cursory sketch of Victoria Woodhull’s remarkable life would have to include that she was in the fi rst group of women to address the House Judiciary Committee (which concluded that Elizabeth Cady Stanton’s speech was superfl uous after Woodhull’s); that she and her sister were the fi rst female stock brokers in America; that her newspaper printed the fi rst translation of Karl Marx’s Communist Manifesto and that he was a congenial pen pal; and that she was the fi rst woman to run for president of the United States, with no one less than Frederick Douglass as her running mate. For two years she served as the president of the National Association of American Spiritualists.34 She was also the most famous and outspoken advocate for free love in America.In 1871, Victoria Woodhull delivered a speech, “The Elixir of Life,” to the Chicago Convention of Spiritualists, in which she told her audi-ence to prepare for the day when their daughters would be dating the dead.35 The millennium, Woodhull claimed, was immediately at hand, but this would usher in not a Christian apostolic utopia but rather the return of the dead. Simultaneously, the living would eliminate disease which in turn would conquer death. Heaven and earth would literally be united, with the eternal living and the returned dead inhabiting the same millennial topos. The key to bringing about the second coming of the spirits was the implementation of free love.The millennium of love can be attained either voluntarily or it will be imposed on people by the spirit realm at their return. She depicts the usually benign spirits as angry and vengeful, a departure from 33 Kent, Free Love, 80–1.34 Bret Carroll has argued that the existence of just such organizations should indicate that Spiritualism was much less amorphous and much better organized than scholarship portrays it.

Woodhull writes, “I tell you that the spirits are coming back to tear your damned system of sexual slavery into tatters and consign its blackened remnants to the depths of everlasting hell.”36 Spiritualism, having dispensed with a fi nal judgment, had no real language of the apocalypse, since its theology lacked a hell, a judging God, and a category of the damned. Woodhull reinfused Spiritualism with the rhetoric of the apocalyptic, but with an inversion of the usual roster of sins—humanity was misusing sexuality, and therefore the spirits were angered.Despite her casual relationship to Christianity, Woodhull conscripted its traditional forms in the service of a reversal of what constitutes sinning:Oh, children of the earth, that you had better put your houses in order and await the coming of the bridegroom or the bride. Accept sexual freedom while it can be attained, by degrees, and not wait until it shall tear up your souls at its sudden coming. . . . I have come to you, in time, to warn you to prepare for what is surely coming, aye, even now is at your very doors, liable to break in upon you and fi nd you like the foolish virgins with your lamps untrimmed.37Sin, then, was normative sexuality and salvation was free love.The rhetoric of the apocalypse, however, is undercut by the very nature of the millennium Woodhull was describing: this was no battle between the forces of good and evil, the ultimate in cosmic dualisms. Instead, this millennium would result in the happy collapsing of heaven and earth, a state in which all would enjoy perfect knowledge and the complete freedom of sexual expression. With death defeated, there would be free intercourse between the living and the dead, enmeshed together on the ladder of love:Then shall we be able to bridge over the gloomy chasm of death, and to build for ourselves a Jacob’s ladder, reaching from earth to heaven, on which spirits and mortals will be perpetually engaged ascending and descending in unending harmony and felicity.3836 Woodhull, “The Elixir of Life,” 16.37 Ibid.38 Ibid., 23."},{"pageNumber":353,"pageContent":"330 cathy gutierrezThe Ladder of LoveAs Arthur Versluis and others have shown, America inherited Europe’s legacy of esotericism.39 Transplanted and transformed in a new land-scape, American hermeticism continued the traditions of the Old World while stamping them ineluctably with the marks of an upstart nation. Spiritualism existed in this hybrid space of radical democracy—includ-ing metaphysical democracy—and the esoteric strains of a learned tradition. As a polyglot movement that crossed class, gender, and even occasionally racial boundaries, Spiritualists’ understanding of erotic love refl ected their diversity and mutual tolerance. The importance of the body and its expression in sexuality was never denied, however. Eros was more than appropriate, it was divine. Only the range of what fell within the category of proper erotics was subject for debate—the essential propriety of the erotic was not.I have argued that two primary cultural productions must be taken into an account of Spiritualist sexuality. First, by abolishing hell, Spiritualists were logically forced to embrace the spectrum of human experience as heaven-worthy, including sexuality even in its worst expres-sions. By severing the primary dualism of heaven and hell, Spiritualists consequently had to sever an entire series of associated dualisms, like sin and salvation, bodies and souls, and a Swedenborgian version of adultery and marriage. By affi rming that human error is not an onto-logical state of sin but rather a corruption of the good, Spiritualist believers moved all forms of antisocial behavior, including improper sexuality, into the realm of reform. Not the threat of brimstone but the promise of a progressive tomorrow would eliminate the misuse of sex. Declassifi ed from sin to crime, bad sexuality was moved into the arena of the culturally operable, where it could be studied, counseled, and eventually cured. But it would not be condemned.In what I hope to show was a related current, Spiritualist articula-tions of sexuality in heaven repeatedly thwart the characterization of even a heterosexual couple as a binary opposition. While the sexes were considered complementary in their natures, they were thought of not as polarized but rather as perfectly fi tted pieces of a jigsaw puzzle. The 39 See Versluis, Esoteric Origins, particularly chapters three and four.

Sex, including in heaven, is a recuperative tech-nique that re-embodies humans as they were originally envisioned, not as separate sexes but as one. The situation, I would argue, is precisely analogous to what Versluis says about the commonalities of different forms of hermeticism: “Hieroeidetic knowledge can be understood in terms of a shift from an objectifying view of language based on self and other to a view of language as revelatory, as a via positiva leading toward transcendence of self-other divisions.”40 Brimming with Pla-tonism, Spiritualist sexuality overcame the subject-object distinction in its construction of true love.Finally, I have argued that not even apocalyptic rhetoric in Spiri-tualism conforms to the binary distinctions that are indeed its very hallmark. Sexuality in the free love movement was too mobile and multiple to conform to dualisms of good and evil; in fact, the basic dualism of married monogamy was its primary target for destruction. Like Woodhull’s ladder that stretched from heaven to earth, the erotics of the afterlife were constantly in process, ascending and descending and unable to be caught in the stasis of marriage.It is, I propose, precisely the image of the ladder, but this time a Pla-tonic one, that prevents Spiritualism from accepting its most infl uential predecessor, Emanuel Swedenborg’s, vision of binary sexuality. Platonic and Neoplatonic thought colored all of Spiritualist writings, where the dominant metaphor of a ladder of spiritual knowledge prevailed. Multiple spheres of the heavens stand in for any number of more classically esoteric visions of ascent, from Plotinian emanations to the sephirot of the Kabbalah and beyond. The universe was not reducible to the simple mathematics of the saved and the damned, and it would seem that generations of Americans remained completely unscathed by the Enlightenment and its privileging of God over man. Additional cultural creations by the Spiritualists would support an argument that Cartesian dualism simply passed them by: in many real ways, they failed to privilege culture over nature, men over women, whites over blacks, or Christianity over anything else. Retaining a Renaissance worldview in which the universe, including humanity, was shot through with the divine, Spiritualists liberated love to ascend to the highest heaven.40 Versluis, “What is Esoteric?” 12."},{"pageNumber":355,"pageContent":"332 cathy gutierrezBibliographyBraude, Ann, Radical Spirits: Spiritualism and Women’s Rights in Nineteenth-Century America.

Here we choose the latter approach, for while a general understanding of broad social movements is of course important as background, the study of American esotericism inexorably requires one to consider specifi c individuals, their context, writings, and thought. This is particularly true when it comes to nineteenth-century American exemplars of sexual mysticism—that is to say, authors whose writings and lives turn on an esoteric understanding of heterosexual practices as part of a spiritual path toward angelic union of the sexes that in turn becomes reunion with the divine.There are only a few nineteenth-century American authors whose works and lives include a developed esoteric sexual mysticism, but each of these fi gures is historically quite important.1 Two of them, John Humphrey Noyes and Thomas Lake Harris, were among the most suc-cessful and infl uential leaders of utopian communities in the history of the United States. Harris, in particular, saw heterosexual union as part of an esoteric Christian mysticism aimed at realization of an angelic androgynic unity and ultimately at union with God.John Humprey Noyes and OneidaAmong the most famous and long-lived of American utopian communi-ties is Oneida, the founding and charismatic leader of which was John 1 In this chapter we do not discuss proponents of sexual magic, such as notably Paschal Beverly Randolph (1825–1875), who is the subject of a chapter by John Patrick Deveney elsewhere in this volume."},{"pageNumber":357,"pageContent":"334 arthur versluisHumphrey Noyes (1811–1886). Noyes’s community and Noyes himself has been the subject of a lively scholarly industry—indeed, there are books about Noyes dating from as early as the mid-nineteenth cen-tury, such as Rev. Hubbard Eastman’s Noyesism Revealed (1848). Clearly, what generated all this interest in Noyes were his controversial sexual doctrines and practices. Noyes is best known for his encouragement, and his community’s practice, of communal marriage and for endors-ing the practice of coitus reservatus in an innovative Christian doctrinal context.Noyes came from a fairly wealthy merchant family and graduated from Dartmouth. A fi rst cousin to President Rutherford B. Hayes, he was converted in the great revival of 1831 and went to divinity school at Yale, where he began to pursue radical causes. Endorsing William Lloyd Garrison’s abolitionism, Noyes also began to endorse “perfection-ism,” the idea that Christians should try to attain complete salvation from sin in this life. This approach has a long history in Christianity and often was persecuted in Europe—one thinks, for instance, of the Cathar heretics of Provençal France, whose highest level was that of the perfecti. Like them, Noyes aimed for the perfect life on earth. Also like the Cathars and similar groups, he and his community were not exactly welcomed by society at large.Early on, Noyes began to see exclusive wedlock as an unhealthy insti-tution. As he gathered a perfectionist community in Putney, Vermont, he began to publish his views, which scandalized his neighbors and ultimately caused his community to fl ee to Oneida in 1848. There they practiced an interesting and relatively well-organized kind of socialism in which matters of procreation and sexual intercourse, as well as most other decisions, were subject to community judgment. While the com-munity at Oneida, which by 1851 had 205 members, was controversial for its sexual views, it was in fact fairly conservative in many other respects, not least in its business practices, which included the produc-tion of dinner silverware in addition to farming and logging. Indeed, when the community effectively disbanded in 1881, it did so by forming the Oneida Corporation, which is still responsible for manufacturing Oneida silverware today.The most controversial of Noyes’s contentions was his affi rmation of “complex marriage” and male continence. As practiced at Oneida, the latter consisted in sexual intercourse without male ejaculation, which, Noyes insisted, transformed intercourse from an animalistic rutting into, at least potentially, a vehicle of spiritual experience. Although this"},{"pageNumber":358,"pageContent":" sexual mysticisms in nineteenth century america 335view has parallels in both Hindu and Buddhist Tantrism, Noyes almost certainly did not derive his approach to sexuality from Asian traditions. Where he did get it, however, remains unclear.Hannah Whitall Smith, in her book Religious Fanaticism (1928), writes fairly favorably of Noyes, remarking that he and his teachings were less “dangerous” than those of Harris. According to her,the followers of Noyes . . . constructed a world of their own, in which special laws prevailed, and . . . adopted a highly peculiar system of sex morality. But they were neither ascetic nor licentious, but on the contrary strictly practical and severely disciplined.2Smith had visited both the Noyes and the Harris communities, and writes that whereas Oneida was “pleasant, if erratic,” Harris’s com-munity and “strange religion” wasdark and mysterious, wrapped in a sort of esoteric symbolism, and envel-oping a secret central doctrine which grows more and more repulsive the closer one approaches to understanding it.3Furthermore, whereas Noyes was “a shrewd and honest fellow,” Harris she considered a “greedy and dangerous sensualist, self-deluded, no doubt, but arrogant, harsh, and revengeful.”4Smith’s distaste for Harris has much to do with the comparative complexity of his thought, and with the fact that whereas Noyes was relatively forthright about the unusual sexual arrangements of the Noyesian utopian community, Harris was much more secretive: his communities clearly did have inner and outer circles. Noyes’s teachings concerning such relatively esoteric sexual techniques as coitus reservatus were quite innovative, but neither his community at Oneida nor his work in general show many explicit connections to prior esoteric currents or traditions. By contrast, Harris’s writings and communities emerged from, and thoroughly refl ect, earlier esoteric currents, Swedenborgianism in particular, and to a lesser extent Christian theosophy in the tradition of Jacob Böhme.Such differences between these two major American founders of utopian communities account, I would argue, for their very different scholarly treatment during the twentieth and early twenty-fi rst centuries. 2 Hannah Whitall Smith, Religious Fanaticism, 100, 106.3 Ibid., 118.4 Ibid."},{"pageNumber":359,"pageContent":"336 arthur versluisNoyes, his community, and his sexual teachings, are the subject of an academic cottage industry (perhaps appropriately, given the industrial successes of Oneida), with publications such as Richard DeMaria’s Com-munal Love at Oneida (1978), Robert Fogarty’s Special Love/Special Sex (1994) and Desire and Duty at Oneida (2000), Lawrence Foster’s (ed.) Free Love in Utopia (2001), and Spencer Klaw’s Without Sin: The Life and Death of the Oneida Community (1993), not to mention the numerous articles and other works devoted to this general subject and theme. By contrast, almost nothing at all has been written about Thomas Lake Harris, although William James called him “America’s best known mystic.” Why is Harris today obscure, while Noyes is the subject of so much study?As I suggested above, Harris’s esotericism may have been a major reason. Noyes’s community was in many ways more accessible and immediately comprehensible: Oneida was an astonishing industrial success, and even its unusual sexual dimensions were, as Noyes him-self even euphemistically called them, essentially social. There is an extraverted, public, even fl amboyant aspect to nearly everything about Oneida. Harris, by contrast, though he too led very large and fairly prosperous utopian communities in New York and in California, lived a much more reclusive and inward-directed life, one that is (despite obvious and profound differences of doctrine and practice) not entirely dissimilar to the life of theosophers such as John Pordage or Johann Georg Gichtel.5 In short, to most modern historians Harris is much less accessible and far more foreign in background and mode of expression than Noyes. But precisely for that reason, he is all the more interesting to the historian of esotericism.Thomas Lake HarrisHarris was born in England and emigrated to America in 1828. In 1845, he became a Universalist minister in New York City, a career which served him for less than two years, for in 1847 he joined the circle around the well-known “spiritualist theologian” Andrew Jackson Davis. But shortly thereafter, Harris became disillusioned by Davis’s endorsement of “free love” and moved to Mountain Cove, Virginia (now in West Virginia), where he lived with a spiritualist community 5 See Antoine Faivre’s chapter in this volume; and cf. Versluis, The Wisdom of John Pordage."},{"pageNumber":360,"pageContent":" sexual mysticisms in nineteenth century america 337from 1850–1853. The community eventually failed and Harris resumed his travels, lecturing on spiritualism in the East and South. During the 1850s, Harris wrote didactic spiritual poetry and developed his seminal ideas, including a belief in fairies and in inner spiritual marriage to one’s “counterpart.” His fi rst wife, Mary—who bore two sons—died unexpectedly in 1850, and he remarried in 1855 to Emily Waters, who accepted Harris’s inner marriage to the “Lily Queen,” and lived in celibacy with him until her death in 1885.After undergoing a series of profound inner experiences during the 1850s and having developed much of his theology and cosmology, Har-ris and his wife traveled to England in 1859, where he announced his own esoteric millennialist group called the “Brotherhood of the New Life,” intended for the “reorganization of the industrial world.” Back in America in 1861, Harris established his group at Brocton, Salem-on-Erie, New York, and another in Fountain Grove, California, where Harris and an inner circle moved in 1875. His Brotherhood was known for its avant-garde views on sexuality, and it eventually came to draw heavily on the Western esoteric traditions.Harris’s early work emerged within the New England Swedenborgian ambience of the 1850s. Addressing that audience, he drew very much on its characteristic vocabulary and worldview, but in fact he presented himself as the successor to Swedenborg. The idea of such a succession had a background in the view among liberal Swedenborgians, such as Prof. George Bush of New York University, that the Swedenborgian system provided not an endpoint, but a foundation from which later revelations would emerge.6 Thus, in The Arcana of Christianity (1858) and in its sequel, The Song of Satan (1860), Harris claimed to have received the direct visionary blessing of Swedenborg himself and to have achieved an even higher level of revelation. Indeed, Christ (often referred to in Harris’s work as “Christ-Christa”) had appeared to Harris and said, “I will open thine eyes and instruct thy heart henceforth in the celestial principle, which is the inmost sense.”7 One can readily imagine the responses of many New Church members to Harris’s implicit claim of superiority to Swedenborg’s teachings.It is clear that Harris’s characteristic views had been worked out already during this relatively early period, and that his subsequent 6 See Schneider & Lawton, A Prophet and a Pilgrim, 22.7 Harris, The Arcana of Christianity, I.44."},{"pageNumber":361,"pageContent":"338 arthur versluiscontroversial life was an unfolding of them. At the end of his life, early in the twentieth century and nearly fi fty years later, we fi nd him struggling against demonic infl uences and in visionary realms, while suffering related physical torments and regarding himself as the “piv-otal man” in the world, the single fi gure who incarnates the primal apocalyptic struggle between good and evil. But already in the 1850s we fi nd Harris writing about “internal respiration” (a concept derived from Swedenborg), about the existence of “fays” or faeries, and about the spiritual importance of male-female “counterparts”: a theory that derived from the Swedenborgian idea of “conjugal” love.It is not easy to make one’s way through Harris’s works. Much of what he writes is prolix and more or less train-of-thought with various digressions. For example, his book The Millennial Age is a record of his extemporaneous remarks at the Marylebone Institute in London, in February and March of 1860. As a result, it is a frustrating text with much blather and little substance. Only occasionally does one gain a sense of what made Harris such a strikingly attractive fi gure for those of his contemporaries who became part of his circle and who perhaps enjoyed being awash in Harris’s fl ood of verbiage. He must have been a charismatic speaker who gave his audience a sense of being genuinely in touch with invisible realities.The primary infl uence on Harris was Swedenborg, though one can detect some possible traces of Christian theosophy as well. But naturally, Harris insisted that his thought and vision was original to him:It was my privilege to behold the Lord, whom I saw in his divine appear-ing, and who laid upon me the charge of receiving and unfolding such of those arcana of the celestial sense as are contained within this volume.8The language here, as in much of Harris’s work, is Swedenborgian in origin; where Swedenborg wrote of “conjugal” relations between men and women, Harris taught a doctrine of “counterparts,” and so forth. As already indicated, there are also some parallels between some of Harris’s writings and Böhmean theosophy. For example, Harris later began to insist that the individual in a divine marriage is linked not with an earthly counterpart, but with the “Lily Queen” of heaven. This term is derived from Böhme’s prophecies of a coming Lilienzeit, or time 8 Harris, The Arcana of Christianity, I.9."},{"pageNumber":362,"pageContent":" sexual mysticisms in nineteenth century america 339of the lily, and from the Böhmean tradition of the soul’s marriage to Sophia, or divine Wisdom.A particularly interesting passage about one of Harris’s spiritual groups is to be found in a letter published in the New Jerusalem Messenger, now the New Church Messenger. This group of about fi fty people was led by S.E. Reynolds, who had been ordained by Harris, and met in an old schoolhouse. The description of their meetings is very interesting:Speeches are given by infl ux. To those whose interiors are quickened, this infl ux is both visible and sensible. When intelligence and faith are treated of, it is through the left temple. When love to the Lord and His Kingdom, through the top of the head and extending to the heart and lungs. When the Word is illuminated the infl ux is through the forehead. Those who are in self-love will soon be pervaded by an infl ux from the hells, passing in at the back of the head and neck, opening interior sight and pervading the entire back. These will soon deny the Lord, or imagine that they are fi lled with the Holy Ghost . . . For my part I think that but the few will attain unto inspiration, while the great mass of mankind who have spiritual manifestations, will receive them from spirits in self-love, fi lling the world with a literature vastly inferior to that of the ordinary schools of the day.9This description clearly refl ects Swedenborg’s characteristic habit of linking various types of infl ux to very specifi c parts of the human body (which microcosmically parallels the body of the divine “Grand Man”), but there may be Böhmean connections as well. Harris’s English fol-lower W.P. Swainson remarked frequently, in his book on Harris’s occult teachings, concerning the parallels between Böhme’s teachings and those of Harris, but there are also parallels between Harris’s teachings and some aspects of the Philadelphians’ works.10Although he remains relatively little-known, Harris was a prolifi c author. In addition to Arcana of Christianity: An Unfolding of the Celes-tial Sense of the Divine Word (1858–1867), he published a collection of extemporaneous lectures entitled The Millennial Age: Twelve Discourses on the Spiritual and Social Aspects of the Times (1860), a monograph on “uni-versal religion” entitled The Breath of God with Man (1867), and, in the 9 New Jerusalem Messenger, now the New Church Messenger, II.108, I.349–350.10 See Swainson, Thomas Lake Harris and His Occult Teachings, 64ff. On the Philadel-phians, see Versluis, Wisdom’s Children. For extracts from experiential texts written by the Philadelphians, see Versluis, Wisdom’s Book.

Harris has also left us hymns and songs, and there is a signifi cant body of unpublished material.In Religious Fanaticism (1928), Hannah Whitall Smith, who seems to have devoted much of her life to gathering rumors about utopian visionaries in nineteenth-century America, wrote that Harris had spent several years “in the Orient, where he learnt a strange vocabulary,” and attracted adherents from as far away as Japan.11 Of course, Harris had not actually gone to the Orient, but it is true that he had a number of Japanese followers.12 Whatever “the Orient” means here, Smith’s comment would suggest that Harris may have had some contact with Buddhism, and at fi rst glance one might be tempted to perceive some allusions to Buddhist meditation in, for instance, The Millennial Age, when Harris talks about one of his pet themes, “internal respiration.” “Redemption of the body,” he tells his audience, “is to begin with inter-nal respiration.”13 But in fact Harris is alluding to a particular kind of breathing that derives from Swedenborg and that is understood to be a result of divine grace rather than a conscious practice or discipline. That Harris knew little about Buddhism is quite obvious some pages later, when he speaks of Buddhism’s goal as “ ‘nigban,’ the utter ces-sation of active faculty,” “heaven as eternal stagnor” that “ends at last in the stagnation of the inner man even here below.”14 His dismissal of Buddhism echoes the prevailing literature of the day.15 It seems clear, then, that Harris’s esotericism was thoroughly European in origin.Although there are perhaps some elements of Harris’s teaching concerning “counterparts” that could be seen as resembling Asian Tantrism, everything I have studied would suggest Western esoteric origins for this particular doctrine. Some of the theology behind the doctrine—including a male-female divinity, and a belief in an enduring transcendent spiritual body—is to be found in the Christian theosophic tradition and in Swedenborg’s theory of “conjugal” love.16 Harris’s doctrine of counterparts states that each individual, male or female, has a counterpart of the other gender. It is rare for both counterparts to 11 See Smith, Religious Fanaticism, 121.12 See Schneider & Lawton, A Prophet and a Pilgrim, 154, 199–200.13 Harris, The Millennial Age, 142.14 Ibid., 170.15 See Versluis, American Transcendentalism and Asian Religions, 16–50.16 Swainson emphasizes the parallels with Böhme’s work, esp. Thomas Lake Harris, 64ff."},{"pageNumber":364,"pageContent":" sexual mysticisms in nineteenth century america 341be incarnated and married; in general, one’s counterpart is a spiritual being.17 Hence one comes to know one’s counterpart through an inner revelatory process, and this is important in view of the public attacks on Harris in the newspapers, instigated by a young woman named Alzire Chevaillier near the end of the period when he was at Fountain Grove. She publicly revealed Harris’s teaching of counterparts and gave it a particularly lurid spin.18 But many other accounts and documents show that in fact Fountain Grove seems to have been an ascetic community, where the sexes were largely separated. The personal accounts of some members indicate that there were sexual dimensions to the counterpart experiences, but they refer to experiences of union with non-physical beings. Still, it is evident that Harris’s teachings also included a joint male-female transformative process.One of the most extensive discussions by Harris of a husband-wife joint process of transformation is to be found in his Arcana of Christian-ity (1867).19 Harris writes that “through the body of the female Word, God reveals Himself to the woman,” but the womanneeds therefore the hierophant, who becomes masculine-feminine, sup-plying from his masculine mind the bodies for the spirits of the ideas disrobed of their ultimate appearance, and left as feminine bodies for the woman’s eyes.20Elsewhere, he writes that “through the Woman’s Word, in the organism of the wife, its virginal sense is fi rst unfolded in the male organism.”21 17 See Harris, “The Children of Hymen,” in The Herald of Light, II.307. Harris writes “Had moral evil never prevailed upon your orb each would have found its own mate and the celestial nuptials been ultimated in the natural union. The Divine Providence, now and for ages has permitted the natural union to occur between spirits who are not in all instances destined to eternal conjugial oneness in the Heavens. For the opposition between the Heavenly and the earthly life is so great that were those who were destined to be thus conjoined in the celestial nuptials externally united, the strife between externals and internals would be . . . fearful.” At the same time, “mar-riage, by the conjunction of spirits in whom regeneration is complete, is the return of the twain into primal oneness.”18 That there was a sexual dimension to these practices was central to the public accusations of Alzire Chevaillier, who raised such a stir that eventually Harris felt compelled to leave the estate near Santa Rosa and travel East. Similar accusations were leveled against Laurence Oliphant, Harris’s most famous and remarkable erst-while follower. See Smith, Religious Fanaticism, 219–228; see also Schneider & Lawton, A Prophet and a Pilgrim, 534–560.19 See Harris, Arcana of Christianity.20 Harris, Arcana of Christianity, I.250.21 Ibid., I.349."},{"pageNumber":365,"pageContent":"342 arthur versluisThese are typically obscure remarks, but it appears Harris is suggesting that a man and a woman play important roles in spiritual awakening for one another.22 Following this discipline, which can condense ten years of inner work into one, can lead the husband and wife into a “crowning with the crown of life.”23 Like John Pordage, Harris writes about a process of inward “new creation,” though unlike Pordage, Harris’s new creation comes about through a process of male-female joint inner transformation, aided by “fays” or inner spirits.24In the 1850s, Harris came to oppose what he called Swedenborgian “sectarianism,” and it is clear why. In Harris’s view,[the] sect of Swedenborgians is built around a nucleus of written memori-als. It is purely historical; necessary perhaps to make up the complement of the sects, but valueless in the sense of a Divine Institution.25Harris was impatient with those who adhered to sectarian doctrines but were unwilling to enter into a transformative process themselves. In addition to a mutual male-female transformative process, other characteristic esoteric aspects of Harris’s works include the internal respiration already alluded to and visionary travels and travails.Internal respiration, a term derived from Swedenborg’s respiratio interna, in Harris takes on a particularly personal dimension.Here is a description from a woman member of Harris’s Brother-hood of New Life at Salem-on-Erie, New York. She entered a dark night of the soul in whichher whole state [was] one of indescribable agitation and grief. Then came the opening of the Breath in the night and all suffering ceased. . . . It begins in the lower part of the abdomen, and from thence rises and fi lls the lungs . . . as high as the throat and down to the knees.This, we are told, was the fi rst degree, and in the “deepest degrees” it “is felt from the sole of the foot to the crown of the head,” and is “full of comfort to spirit and body.”26 Furthermore, she is subsequently fi lled with great love and tenderness when she reads the Bible or contemplates the life of Christ. The descriptions of “internal breathing” have specifi c physical aspects; it is clearly not abstract or strictly intellectual.22 Ibid., I.332.23 Ibid., I.349.24 Ibid., I.333.25 See Harris, in The Herald of Light, II.437.26 Schneider & Lawton, A Prophet and a Pilgrim, 173."},{"pageNumber":366,"pageContent":" sexual mysticisms in nineteenth century america 343The visionary dimensions of Harris’s teachings have their clearest predecessors in Andrew Jackson Davis and, before that, in the work of Swedenborg. Harris’s accounts include visiting the spiritual inhabitants of planets like Saturn or Venus, as well as the Sun. This is an estab-lished current that we also see later in the Sympneumata of Laurence Oliphant, Harris’s erstwhile student. When, in 1922, Harris’s English follower W.P. Swainson wrote a small volume titled Thomas Lake Harrisand His Occult Teachings, he began with a few chapters devoted to Harris’s fantastic visionary voyages to various planets and continued by offering a lucid and concise description of Harris’s accounts “of the conditions of life on the sinless or unfallen worlds.”27 These worlds are described as beautiful and “ethereal,” or “aromal.” Venus, Mars, Jupiter, the other planets, and even distant suns are inhabited by peoples with their own civilizations and unique planetary characteristics. As Swainson puts it, Harrismakes such stupendous claims that, on fi rst acquaintance, one naturally feels skeptical as to the truth of much that he asserts. Even after a more or less comprehensive study of his writings it is diffi cult to bring oneself to accept many of his statements.28What distinguishes Harris’s visionary experiences is the pivotal role that he himself plays in the invisible worlds or dimensions. He was often referred to by his disciples as the “Primate,” sometimes as the “Faithful,” or even as “Primate Pivotal Twain-in-One”; and he described himself as “the pivot.” His disciples regarded him more or less the way Sufi disciples are said to regard their shaykh. He consistently believed himself to intervene not only in local or regional metaphysical dimensions, but also on a national and international as well as cosmic scale. Account after account by his contemporaries and by Harris himself has him struggling with demons, exorcising them, and curing the possessed or affl icted, to such an extent that Schneider and Lawton are unable to resist poking fun at him—as when, late in his life, Harris’s wife makes a skin rash into an outbreak of the hells on earth. There are parallels with Gichtel and (to a lesser extent) with Pordage, as well as with, more recently, the magical order of Dion Fortune or the writings of Kyriacos Markides about the Magus of Strovolos.

Quite direct and revealing is a narrative called “A Sister in the New Life,” from letters written by an anonymous young woman who came to the Harris community in 1881. This gives a very lucid portrait of what it was like to enter into the Harris circle. The narra-tive is phenomenological: it is fi lled with descriptions of the author’s inner states in relation to Harris. There are also references to Swe-denborgians, like the following: “I was told one thing by him [Harris], that Swedenborgianism, more than any other -ism, destroyed truth and goodness. All the greatest troubles and worst lies that have been sent by the evil powers against him, have come through that sect.”29 But much more characteristic is the author’s descriptions of her inner experiences, which shed much light on the experiential dimensions of Harris’s esoteric teachings.The letters have no author’s name, but they exist in a number of versions with titles like “From a Lady in San Francisco to a Friend in England.” The narrative begins almost immediately with descriptions of unusual inner sensations and phenomena. She writes of a peculiar vibrating sensation in her arms, which gradually extended throughout her body.The fi rst time that it came into my body, that is the trunk, it seemed to enter through the generative organs, and with it came the thought, this is like sexual intercourse, only infi nitely more so, in that every atom of your frame enters into union with another atom to the furthest extremity of your body.30She felt “infi nitely calm and peaceful, nothing turbulent and passionate about it, and my only desire was to constantly pray in thankfulness.” The next day (17 May 1881), she felt as if “little wings” were moving in her breast, along with great exhaustion and a sense of joy.The erotic dimension of these experiences is obvious. Already by May 23, she felt her counterpart within her, referring to him as her inner husband or angel, and she realized with “reverence” “the Mother’s temple within myself,” and that “the womb and life-giving organs 29 Schneider & Lawton, A Prophet and a Pilgrim, 518. See also 527.30 Schneider & Lawton, A Prophet and a Pilgrim, 511."},{"pageNumber":368,"pageContent":" sexual mysticisms in nineteenth century america 345must be very holy.”31 Both the author and her sister felt an associated change in breathing, and sometimes when the vibrations began they gripped one another in order to feel what was going on, “and she can feel something like electricity almost.”32 She later writes (5 June 1881) how “very strange” was the feeling of her counterpart, which began with “a strange sensation in my arms,” “gradually extending all over.”33 This was a “delightful” sensation, yet she becameso utterly exhausted and worn out that I feel at times as if I could not endure it. I never used to have a conscious sensation about my body, and now it is all changed. The breathing, the circulation, rushing, fl utterings, turnings, and I scarce know what, make me never free from a conscious-ness of my body all the time.Needless to say, all of this activity gave her insomnia, but if exhaus-tion was a price she had to pay, the purchase was a sense of “ecstasy” and of dissolving into an invisible other.34 She felt a movement in her “bowels” or womb, and at times her spine seemed to vanish.35 She feels, by December 3, “currents of life fl owing into me continually, and Father [ Harris] says they are from him.”Harris’s doctrines included a belief in faeries, and in this regard he continues a tradition that has predecessors in such quasi-Rosicrucian works as Abbé N. de Montfaucon de Villars’s Comte de Gabalis (1670) and, of course, in British traditions concerning faeries. Faeries, or the “fay,” as Harris and his community called them, play a signifi cant role in “A Sister in the New Life.” Harris acted as a medium for “fairies,” on one occasion “talk[ing] for over an hour” and “answer[ing] all sorts of questions in the loveliest soft lisping notes, they are mostly vowel sounds.”36 The sister’s account includes numerous references to small voices and to beautiful little people, who sing little refrains within her, for example, “This is love and love is bliss; life is love and love’s a kiss.”37 Here is the entry from 9 June 1881, at Fountain Grove in Santa Rosa:31 Schneider & Lawton, A Prophet and a Pilgrim, 514.32 Schneider & Lawton, A Prophet and a Pilgrim, 515.33 Schneider & Lawton, A Prophet and a Pilgrim, 523.34 Schneider & Lawton, A Prophet and a Pilgrim, 524.35 Schneider & Lawton, A Prophet and a Pilgrim, 531.36 Schneider & Lawton, A Prophet and a Pilgrim, 531.37 Schneider & Lawton, A Prophet and a Pilgrim, 521."},{"pageNumber":369,"pageContent":"346 arthur versluisThey told me about the fays while I was up at Fountain Grove; how at fi rst a little “Two-in-one” would move into a person’s breast as soon as they could fi nd entrance, and then clearing a space would begin to build their house; soon they would have a garden and plant fruit-trees; and then little baby fays would be born. The fays have many babies, and so they keep and keep on enlarging the spaces and fi lling them full of beauti-ful houses, gardens, and groves, till at last the whole being, to the very extremities of fi ngers and toes, is all a fairy universe, a world of loveliness. Just think of having lovely little fays bathing in the veins.38There is something charming about this little story, to be sure. What makes the account particularly unusual is that the fay are experienced as bodily phenomena: they are accompanied by particular sensations (“fl utterings”) as well as by inner songs. From this detailed personal narrative by “A Sister in the New Life,” we can gain at least some sense of how Harris’s abstract concepts in Arcana of Christianity and elsewhere manifested themselves in individual experiences within his esoteric community.An obliquely critical portrait of Harris is visible in Laurence Oliph-ant’s two-volume novel Masollam (1886). Oliphant, a wealthy English nobleman and member of Parliament, had become a disciple of Harris’s in the fall of 1867, and at least half of the Brocton community hold-ings were purchased with Oliphant’s money. Later, Oliphant and his wife left Harris’s community in a very public and ugly falling-out, with many mutual recriminations. In Masollam, Harris’s erstwhile disciple depicts himself as the hero, with the transparently obvious name of “Santalba” [implying “holy” and “white”] whereas Masollam (Harris) is depicted as a man who has originally had real spiritual experience and insights but has gone astray. Given Oliphant’s and Harris’s public and bitter parting of the ways, it is not surprising that the same thing happens in the novel. While the novel is prolix—it could have been less than half its length—it does include some very interesting indications of Harris’s teachings.In the middle of the second volume, Santalba gives the following set of teachings to a Druse shaikh, referring to a young woman named “Anima,” who had been raised and trained by Masollam. Santalba tells the shaikh that38 Schneider & Lawton, A Prophet and a Pilgrim, 525."},{"pageNumber":370,"pageContent":" sexual mysticisms in nineteenth century america 347the world’s deliverance has come, and it has come in the form of a woman. It could not be delivered hitherto, because the sexes were divided; but in union is strength. It is only when the sexes are united according to the divine intention that the redemptive forces for the world’s deliverance can play through them; and it is through the operation of the divine feminine that this union must be achieved. This is the interpretation of your vision of the twofold Word. Regard women, therefore—but espe-cially the woman by your side [Anima]—in a different light from what you have hitherto done.39Soon after, Sheikh Mohanna tells Santalba:You have said that the highest form of inspiration could only descend by means of the operation of a conjunction of masculine and feminine elements; and that therefore its most fi tting receptacle was an associated pair.40But, he goes on to inquire, what if one’s partner has died, as happened to Santalba [and in real life, to Oliphant]? Santalba replies:She who was my associate on earth, and who has passed into higher conditions, is not prevented thereby from co-operating with me . . . . due to the fact that during our external union we had, by long and arduous effort and ordeal, arrived at a consummation, whereby an internal and imperishable tie had been created, the mystery of which I dare not enter upon now.Suffi ce it to say, Santalba notes, that his “consociation” with his dead wife is not mere mediumship but “a permanent condition of free and independent mental association, with a pure intelligence of the upper region.”41 In ordinary spiritualism,the bodily health is injured, the intellectual faculties are enfeebled . . . by the invasion of infl uences which torture the mind and body which they have made their abiding-place, and which cannot be ejected. It is the penalty which poor mortals pay for attempting to pry, by disorderly methods, into the secrets of nature, which they are not meant to penetrate.By contrast, this higher union results inincreased mental vigour and bodily strength, a consciousness of moral and intellectual freedom and spontaneity. The individuality, instead of being suppressed, is reinforced. With every accession of power there fl ows 39 Oliphant, Masollam, II.123.40 Oliphant, Masollom, II.128–129.41 Oliphant, Masollom, II.130."},{"pageNumber":371,"pageContent":"348 arthur versluisin a rushing current of love for the human race, and a desire to serve it. There is no longing to pry into mysteries, because knowledge seems to ripen in the mind more rapidly than it can be acted on.42One could object that what we see above are Oliphant’s teachings, not those of Harris. But earlier in the novel, Masollam [Harris] tells the young Anima thatalone I am powerless; that it is only a woman who can feed me with the elements which are essential to the ultimation of my forces, which need this conjunction to render them operative. . . . For the rule of the man is naught without the woman.43Both characters, Santalba and Masollam, teach that the spiritual union of man and woman is essential, and this is a direct refl ection of their theology of a male-female God. The male-female nature of God is the secret discerned by Santalba’s Druse chieftain friend Sheikh Mohanna, and it is central to the themes of the novel as a whole.44 Those who go astray in the novel—notably Masollam and his wife—do so by detours away from spiritual union and divine service into passion or ambition. The novel is not fl attering to Harris, but it does nonetheless refl ect some of Harris’s most characteristic and central teachings.Alice Bunker StockhamWhile Noyes and Harris were more widely infl uential—both because of their writings and because of their utopian communities—one fi nal fi gure must be mentioned here as exemplary of what I have termed 42 Oliphant, Masollom, 130–131.43 Oliphant, Masollom, I.253.44 Oliphant, Masollom, II.111–112, where Sheikh Mohanna tells Santalba that he “now perceived, what has been hidden from the faithful till now, that the ‘Eternal Word’ was twofold, masculine and feminine, and the feminine principle was shown to me that I might understand this, and I was further made aware that my apprehension of this truth would constitute my deliverance.” He sees a female fi gure in blinding light, who places a warning fi nger on her lips. His fi rst experience “of intercourse with the gross and superfi cial beings in the unseen world” “helped me to work wonders and perform acts of healing.” His “second experience” was “of those profounder and subtler intelligences of a more nether sphere, who delude men with the specious phraseology of occult science, and seek to draw them away from the practice of true religion, by the substitution for it of esoteric dogmas.” Now he perceived the “difference between the true and false” but found it “impossible to describe,” to be “apprehended only by experience; and . . . as my people were not yet ready to receive this truth, I must be silent in regard to it.”"},{"pageNumber":372,"pageContent":" sexual mysticisms in nineteenth century america 349American esoteric pragmatism: the remarkable Alice Bunker Stockham (1833–1912).45 Stockham founded no utopian community, and like Harris she has been overlooked by scholars, but she was a signifi cant author whose work continues and develops the Noyesian tradition of coitus reservatus in marriage. One of the fi rst female M.D.s in the United States, trained as an obstetrician/gynecologist whose practice was based in Chicago, Stockham writes in a manner that refl ects her medical training and perspective. In this work, we do not fi nd evidence of the Swedenborgian/Böhmean current of androgynic mysticism that we encountered in Harris’s teachings. What we do fi nd is typical of what we might call a more secular sexual mysticism of human creativity.Although Stockham did visit India, it is highly improbable that as a tourist who did not speak the requisite languages, and as a woman, Stockham could have been initiated into an actual Tantric sect in India. In fact it is very clear that her work derives directly from the previous writing of John Humphrey Noyes. In her most important work, Karezza (1896), she includes corroborating testimony that cites without attribu-tion Noyes’s well-known description of how coitus reservatusmay be compared to a stream in three conditions, viz.: 1. a fall; 2, a course of rapids above the fall; and 3, still water above the rapids. The skillful boatman may choose whether he will remain in the still water, or venture more or less down the rapids, or run his boat over the fall.46Although his name is never mentioned, not only is the description uniquely Noyes’s, but so too is Stockham’s sexual theory of karezza (sexual intercourse without male ejaculation), right down to the descrip-tion of its health benefi ts for both men and women.This having been said, one also has to acknowledge the unique dimensions of Stockham’s own work. Harris’s teachings were truly esoteric, and even Noyes’s teachings were intended primarily for the benefi ts of his followers, but Stockham sought to disseminate the idea of coitus reservatus as widely as possible. Her books, especially Karezza, are fi lled with the spirit of proselytization for what she clearly saw as a possible, indeed, a necessary socio-sexual revolution. The relations between the sexes could be entirely transformed, if only husband and 45 See Beryl Satter, Each Mind a Kingdom, 134–149.

While Stock-ham is exoteric in her desire to convey her sexual theory as widely as possible, she is drawing on a long-standing tradition of the androgyne in Western esotericism when she writes that “in every soul there is a duality, the male and female principle,” and that “though but one in spirit, in spiritual expression soul in every person is twofold, a blended male and female.”47 Thus, she continues,as sex is in the soul[,] it is not impossible, as spiritual unity is developed, that a procreation of thought may be accomplished—that is, a procreation on the spiritual plane, not of individuals, but of principles and theories that can be practically developed for the good of the world.48Hence even the more classically esoteric dimensions of Stockham’s thought—like the aspiration to androgyneity—are ultimately legitimated for her only by their exoteric consequences “practically developed for the good of the world.”What we see in the work of Stockham is a particularly American kind of esotericism, one concerned largely with specifi c practices and with pragmatic individual and social results. Unconcerned with religious particularities, Stockham’s work stands in the long American tradi-tion of universalism and pragmatism whose greatest representative is Emerson, a tradition with no lack of representatives through to Alan Watts, the human potential movements, East-West syncretism, New Age fi gures and sects, right into the present day. Like Noyes before her, like William James, Stockham was concerned with results and effects for the individual, as well as with the potential transformation of the whole of human society.47 Stockham, Karezza, 94.48 Stockham, Karezza, 95."},{"pageNumber":374,"pageContent":" sexual mysticisms in nineteenth century america 351Concluding RemarksOne contemporary critique of both Noyes and Harris (thought not of Stockham) was that they were not only perfectionists but also antinomians. As early as 1849, the Rev. Hubbard Eastman wrote of Noyes as “the great magician of Putney” and as no less “an impostor than the far-famed Arabian Prophet! Mahometanism, Mormonism, Perfectionism, and a long catalogue of other isms, are all of kindred character.”49 The incensed Rev. Eastman also quotes a Mr. Pratt, whose local newspaper editorial gives a fl avor of the time. Pratt asserts, in even more infl amed rhetoric than Eastman, that Noyesism is no less than a “monster of iniquity,” and that “each member of it holds to principles that justify theft, robbery, arson, and murder, and all other crimes his evil passions prompt; for he cannot sin, and his impulse is the only law he recognizes.”50 Eastman quotes from a variety of such editorials and assessments of the perfectionists, and the gist of all of them is that perfectionism is a form of antinomianism. Likewise, Harris was predictably accused of being a libertine who justifi ed his actions by way of a religious rationale.In fact, however, there is no evidence that either Noyes or Harris were antinomians, at least if the word “antinomian” is taken to mean those who believe that they have the freedom to commit all manner of crimes. Indeed, Noyes was renowned as a shrewd and honest business-man—it is no accident that Oneida became a wealthy industrial com-munity. And Harris’s various communities were likewise quite wealthy and, by most accounts, well-organized. His community at Brocton ran a restaurant and a hotel. His nearly eighteen-hundred-acre estate in California included a thriving vineyard and winery. Although their sexual theories were outside social norms, Noyes and Harris and their respective followers and communities were widely respected, and when their sexual theories and practices began to be revealed, a number of local people and newspapers expressed disbelief in the accusations.Compare this record to the kind of antinomianism manifested in early modernity in the works and lives of Ranters like Abiezer Coppe (1619–1672), Tobias Crisp (1609–1643), and Lawrence Clarkson 49 See Eastman, Noyesism Unveiled, 183.50 Ibid., 281, citing an editorial in the Phoenix, 7 January, 1848."},{"pageNumber":375,"pageContent":"352 arthur versluis(1615–1667). It was Crisp who famously said that “to be called a liber-tine is the most glorious title under heaven.”51 And it was Coppe who put such a theory into action, preaching that he could “kiss and hug ladies, and love my neighbour’s wife as myself, without sin.” To serve God is “perfect freedom and pure libertinism.”52 Clarkson wrote in A Single Eye that “there is no such act as drunkenness, adultery and theft in God. . . . Sin hath its conception only in the imagination.”53 Ranters, Christopher Hill observed, “deliberately aimed to shock the godly, to provoke them into rethinking their assumptions about religion and society.”54 Deliberately “naughty and provocative” and asserting total freedom, Ranters represent also the clearest examples of antino-mianism with which the present author is familiar.In contrast, what we see in the works of Noyes and Harris, and to some extent Stockham, is not overt antinomianism, but rather very developed forms of related esoteric systems. All three authors affi rmed a dual male-female divinity. All three encouraged and taught spiritual disciplines with sexual dimensions. Noyes and Harris were leaders of utopian communities at the center of which were esoteric doctrines. Both insisted, despite the various scandals and accusations, on religious and moral discipline in their respective groups. And fi nally, both gen-erated industrious and successful communities that dissolved primarily under Victorian social pressure brought to bear because of the sexual dimensions of their teachings. Harris, in particular, presents one of the most complex and developed forms of sexual mysticism. It is easy to dismiss out of hand what Noyes, Harris, and Stockham taught and practiced, and indeed some of it does seem outlandish. But the more one studies them, the more intriguing they become as exemplars in the long tradition of American pragmatist esotericism or esoteric pragmatism.51 See Hill, Liberty Against the Law, 215.

Magic before the arrival of the mysterious Mr. Norrell is a bit of fl otsam only, the debris of a once-great synthesis that survives solely to intrigue the curious. This is the description of the York society of magicians with which the book opens:They were gentlemen magicians, which is to say they had never harmed any one by magic, nor ever done any one the slightest good. In fact, to own the truth, not one of the magicians had ever cast the smallest spell nor by magic caused one leaf to tremble upon a tree, made one mote of dust to alter its course or changed a single hair upon any one’s head. But, with this minor reservation, they enjoyed a reputation as some of the wisest and most magical gentlemen in Yorkshire.2The real magical world of the mid-nineteenth-century West was in a similar predicament. A generation of modern scholars has labored to descry the reality (and the practice) behind the hefty tomes and the intimations of the initiatic novels of the period, but to little avail. The secondhand formulas of Barrett’s The Magus (1801),3 the Romantic pseudo-realism of Bulwer-Lytton’s novels Zanoni: A Rosicrucian Tale and The Coming Race,4 and the Gothic labyrinths of Eliphas Levi’s disquisi-tions5 bring us little information on any underlying substrate of real magical practice and experience. Barrett was a dabbler, cribbing what 1 Clarke, Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell.2 Ibid., 3.3 Barrett, The Magus.

Bookish antiquarianism is the occu-pational hazard of the student of magic: the delight of unearthing the deliberately obscure becomes its own reward—a secret, miser-like delight in minutiae known only to the student and, most importantly, not known to competitors.8 Examples abound, and they could be mul-tiplied ad infi nitum. We look in vain for solid evidence of practical magic or lived experience. Even Mesmerism, which by mid-century had incorporated elements of traditional magic and produced rather astonishing experiences, suffered almost universally from the bane of secondhand experience: the entranced seeress (for it was usually a young girl) saw visions, while the mesmerist could only look on and wonder at her descriptions.9 The most detailed description we have of what 6 “There is another thing not generally known as to the late Lord Lytton.

His later works must have been written in an ecstasy the result of Opium, & many of the curious things enunciated by him, he must have got at thro’ his Clairvoyantes. I think now I have given you some slight idea of what the late Lord Lytton’s Occultism was.” William Alexander Ayton to unnamed American correspondent, January 22, 1886 (private collection). Ayton constantly bemoaned his own failure to achieve what magic had promised, and ended up in his advanced old age moving his efforts fi rst into the H.B. of L. and then into the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn.7 William Alexander Ayton to unnamed correspondent, May 18, 1885 (private col-lection). “You mention Eliphas Levi.

His experience was secondhand: he was reduced to hearing (or reading about) the experiences of another.All of this has always seemed to me to be a choice made faut de mieux, the replacing of one thing with a (lesser) substitute, a transposi-tion caused by the unavailability of that which was really and indeed sought: direct vision and experience. The literature abounds with examples of true, burning desire for spiritual or psychical achievement and attainment. But it also abounds with stories of failure, and diversion of interest to lesser, more attainable interests. It was this mid-century world of antiquarianism, empty ritualism, and secondhand experience that Paschal Beverly Randolph transformed.The facts of Randolph’s life and deeds are well established and need not be rehearsed here in detail.11 He was a black man, born free in New York City in 1825. Without father, mother, or family, from an early age he managed to survive on the streets of the “Five Points,” the lowest slum of New York at the time, and succeeded in obtaining a modicum of education that permitted him in his early twenties to take up the profession of barber in Upstate New York. That might have been the end of his story; but in 1848, also in Upstate New York, the Fox Sisters learned how to communicate with what they came to learn were the spirits of the departed and, in the process, gave birth to modern Spiritualism. Randolph adopted the new revelations with fervor and promptly became a medium himself. Unlike many of his contemporaries who saw the advantages of exploiting the theatrical side of Spiritualism (levitation, fl oating tambourines, spirit painting, and Arcanes de la vie future, 3 vols. (1848–54), 180 (neither DeLaborde, Dupotet, Cagliostro, nor the sorcerer Léon—an eighteenth-century Jew whose magic mirror Cahagnet describes—actually saw visions themselves).10 Britten, Ghost Land. Britten was in a good position to describe the doings of the groups since she almost certainly functioned as a “fl ying soul” for the Orphic Circle in her youth.

He soon moved beyond Spiritualism.By the late 1850s, Randolph was beginning to acquire a name as a visionary but also a reputation as a mad man—a reputation that even he himself, at times, admitted was accurate, as his mind was buffeted by the infl uence of the various “controls” he encountered in his trances. In 1855 and 1857, he made the fi rst of his trips to Europe and to the Near East, where he learned the marvels of Mesmerism and of mirror magic (employed, usually secondhand, by the likes of the Orphic Circle and others), and of hashish, which he saw both as a torment and as his liberator from the possession of his controls.From what he learned during his travels Randolph also acquired a framework upon which to hang his visionary experiences. Derived initially from the works of the Spiritualist Andrew Jackson Davis, and then supplemented by the more sophisticated and literary magical tradi-tion of Europe, Randolph’s cosmology and worldview were in no sense original. But, as vivifi ed by his experiences, they were adequate to his purposes and were, in any case, decidedly secondary to the practical methods he began to teach to enable others to experience the visionary worlds for themselves.All of this came together when he published Dealings with the Dead (1861),12 in which he for the fi rst time clearly describes his vision of a vast cosmos of worlds, universes, and entities coruscating out hier-archically from the grand Central Sun of being.13 From this divine source “light” in all its forms fl owed outward: mere matter, then the all-pervading fi re fl uid of the Mesmerists, and fi nally a never ending stream of “soul monads,” “scintillas or parts of this third great thought of the Mighty Thinker, God . . . coruscations from The Over-Soul.”14 These sparks of divine light are sprinkled through the planes of the infi nite universes in a vast hierarchy that far outstrips the contem-12 Randolph [“The Rosicrucian”], Dealings With The Dead.13 Ibid., 44.14 Ibid., 5, 134, 204."},{"pageNumber":382,"pageContent":" paschal beverly randolph and sexual magic 359porary accounts of the Spiritualists: men, angels, Seraphs, Arsaphs, Eons, Arsasaphs, Arch-Eons, Antarphim, and other exalted entities, all existing and acting in the fi re fl uid (which Randolph called “Aeth”) and all seeking to re-ascend to their divine source. Man begins this vast pilgrimage as an unconscious monad, the “germ of an immortal soul,” putting on and casting off forms of matter until reaching the human state.15 Here the monad as such ceases to be, and in its stead stands an immortal soul, an individualized being, more or less awakened but “self-existent to all future states”16 and capable now of joining the great cosmic parade. He functions now in the “soul world” and can begin his asymptotic re-ascent.Randolph’s description of becoming aware of himself as an individu-alized being, coursing through the soul world as a “globe of resplendent white light” is beautiful and ecstatic:The eye did not see, but I was all sight. There was no organ of locomo-tion . . . but my spirit seemed to be all motion, and it knew instinctively that by the power of the thought-wish it could reach any point within the boundaries of earth where it longed and willed to be.17Accompanying this experience was the perceived ability to visualize and utilize the Aeth—Randolph’s term for the “boundless, undefi nable, and unimaginable ocean of Liquid Fire” which Andrew Jackson Davis called the Univercoelum—that fi lled and animated creation and formed the basis of all magical power.18 The soul world also brought Randolph into connection with other, more elevated and exalted entities of the cosmic hierarchy, both human and never-human, whose power, knowledge, and wisdom he participated in through the mysterious experience called 15 Ibid., 46–47.16 Ibid., 257. This, of course, is a form of conditional immortality, a concept that has a long and involved history in occultism. Massimo Introvigne has concluded that from the eighteenth century on, most, though not all, initiatic groups practicing a form of “internal alchemy” (as did Cagliostro and his followers) were based upon the doctrine of conditional immortality—the idea that not all men were immortal—and coupled this with techniques to construct an immortal soul, a “body of light” or “inte-rior child” as it is frequently called, that would be immortal. See Introvigne, Il capello del mago and “Cagliostro.” In Cagliostro’s case this quest for “physical immortality” was certainly a goal, pursued during his two forty-day retreats. These (probably in his case, and certainly in those of his various later disciples) involved sexual techniques involving the retention of semen or its internal re-circulation. See, e.g., Introvigne, “Arcana Arcanorum.”17 Ibid., 174–79.18 Ibid., 180–82, 188."},{"pageNumber":383,"pageContent":"360 john patrick deveney“Blending”—the merging, as it were, of personalities in a process with more than a passing resemblance to sexual union:[ B]y slow degrees I felt that my own personality was not lost to me, but completely swallowed up, so to speak, in that of a far more potent mentality. A subtlety of thought, perception and understanding became mine at times, altogether greater than I had ever known before; and occasionally, during these strange blendings of my being with another, I felt that other’s feelings, thought that other’s thoughts . . .19Randolph had fi rst experienced this state of Blending (or “Atrilism” or “mixed identities”) in his purely Spiritualist days, when he “blended” in vision with the spirit of a deceased lover, but over the years he came to see that the process was universal and that in it lay the secret of communication with the exalted entities above man in the cosmic hierarchy. He also realized that the key to the process, and indeed the key to all the secrets of the universe, lay in sex.We hold that no power ever comes to man through the intellect. . . . Power comes only to the Soul through love (not lust, mind you), but love, the underlying, Primal fire life, subtending the bases of Being,—the formative fl owing fl oor of the worlds,—the true sensing of which is the beginning of the road to personal power. Love lieth at the foundation, and is the synonym of life and strength . . . Thus it happens that a loving couple grow youthful in soul, because in their union they strike out this divine spark, replenish themselves with the essence of life, grow stronger and less brutal, and draw down to them the divine fi re from the aerial spaces. (This now is by accident. We teach how to do so at pleasure).20All of this is quite wonderful, and there can be no doubt that Randolph’s descriptions accurately refl ect his actual visionary experiences. But all of this is also, both for Randolph and for us, quite secondary. There is no end to genuine visionaries—Boehme, for example—but Randolph’s importance lies not in the myriad planes, universes, and worlds he describes but in the methods he taught to enable the reader to rise to the same experiences himself—to enter the soul world as a conscious individualized soul.Some of these methods were openly advocated and described in his lectures and books beginning in the late 1850s. Drugs, for example, especially Dowam Meskh,21 an electuary of hashish and other inert or 19 Ibid., 11–12.20 Randolph [Anonymus], The Ansairetic Mystery.21 Randolph [Anonymus], The Guide to Clairvoyance, and Clairvoyant’s Guide."},{"pageNumber":384,"pageContent":" paschal beverly randolph and sexual magic 361psychoactive ingredients like hyoscamine, were an important part of the process, and Randolph touted them as the secret of “the Alchemists, Hermetists, Illuminati, and mystic brethren of all ages,”22 though in more sober moments he warned of their perils. “Magic mirrors,” com-pound mirrors of sheets of convex glass sandwiching various magnetized liquids, also played a great role in this public exposition of Randolph’s magic, and the fruit of the conjoined use of drugs and mirrors was the exalted state of “clairvoyance.”Clairvoyance, as the term was used by Randolph’s contemporaries, had usually meant an unprovoked state into which the seer (Andrew Jackson Davis, for example)23 fell without preparation, except at times through magnetism, and in which he acquired special powers (such as intuition or diagnosic skill) and “vision”—the ability to view, like a tourist, the wonders of the spiritual world. For Randolph, not only was clairvoyance something that could be consciously attained by drugs and mirrors, but the state itself was far more elevated than commonly believed. In the highest degree of clairvoyance, the magician “sees, senses, feels, knows, by a royal power; is en rapport with a thousand knowledges.”24 Clairvoyance was theability, by self-effort or otherwise, to drop beneath the fl oors of the outer world, and come up, as it were, upon the other side. . . . It is the light which the seer reaches sometimes through years of agony . . . together with a knowledge of the principia of the vast spirit-sea whereon the worlds of space are cushioned.25Clairvoyance, in other words, was the state in which the soul consciously took possession of itself and became aware of its ability to function in the soul world.Beyond these public techniques was Randolph’s ultimate secret—sexual magic. From the early 1860s on Randolph touted in his openly published books the existence of vaguely hinted-at secrets and tech-niques. To the enquirer enticed by these hints and seeking deeper mys-teries, he then privately circulated a bewildering variety of broadsheets, pamphlets, and letters providing more explicit details of his secret techniques. These culminated in the early 1870s in The Ansairetic Mystery. 22 Ibid., 47–48.23 See, e.g., Smith, Lectures on Clairmativeness.24 Ibid., 14.25 Randolph [“Count de St. Leon”], Love and its Hidden History, 166–67."},{"pageNumber":385,"pageContent":"362 john patrick deveneyA New Revelation Concerning Sex! A Private Letter, Printed, but not Published; it being Sacred and Confi dential.26 Building on the ideas set out in Dealings with the Dead, Randolph clarifi ed his fundamental intuition:[ N ]o real magic (magnetic) power can, or will, descend into the soul of either, except in the mighty moment—the orgasmal instant of both—not one alone! for then, and then only, do the mystic forces of the soul open to the spaces. . . . The eternal spark within us (and which never fl ashes except when the loving female brings to her feet the loving man in their mutual infi ltration of Soul, in the sexive death of both—that intense moment when woman proves herself the superior of man—mutual demise!) was created by allah—God himself—Billions of ages ago in the foretime, and fi nds its human body only when Sex-passion opens the mystic door for it to enter the man—through him, the woman, through her the world, through them the Spaces, and through it again Allah, God—not as a drop of infi nite ocean of Mind, but as a Being in the Heavenly hierarchies!* * *Now, Man, being the chief work of Nature; allied to all that is; being the central fi gure upon which all forces play; and copulative union being the crowning act of his being — it follows that his moment of greatest Power is that in which Love unlooses the doors of his Spirit, and all his energies are in highest action; whence it happens that they who unitedly Will a thing, during copulative union and its mutual ending, possess the key to all possible Knowledge, the mighty want of White Magic.27Appended to The Ansairetic Mystery is a list of 122 powers obtainable through sexual magic, ranging from the paltry (beauty and business success) to the more profound (though vaguely described) secrets of Volantia, Decretism, Posism, Tirau-clarism, Oriental Breast-Love, Mahi-vapia, Zorvoyance, Æthævoyance, and including the power to “attach to oneself innumerable æthic, ærial, invisible assistants. (Arsa-phism)”—Blending, in other words.All this, in turn, was explained in Randolph’s last and greatest book: Eulis, published in 1874,28 the year before he committed suicide. Here Randolph explains the three fundamental laws of all magic: Volantia, Decretism, and Posism. “Volantia” is “the quiet, steady, calm, non-tur-bulent, non-muscular exertion of the human Will”; and the elements of the will (attention, concentration and abstraction), he teaches, can 26 Deveney, Paschal Beverly Randolph, Appendix A.27 Ibid.28 Randolph, Eulis!"},{"pageNumber":386,"pageContent":" paschal beverly randolph and sexual magic 363be developed by staring at a spot on the wall or at a disk placed on the magic mirror while trying to control the phantasms that appear. This power was also described as Tirau-clairism. “Decretism” is the “decreeing, ordering, commanding” power of the will. At the “decretal instant”—the moment of orgasm—this power “leaps from the soul like a fl ash of vivid white lightning, traversing space, centering on its object even though oceans fl ow between, or vast spaces divide.” “Posism,” fi nally, is the greatest of the powers of Randolph’s magic. It is the “placing [of ] oneself in a receptive position, state, frame of body, mind and feeling.” On one level, this was meant quite literally. Taking the pose of repulsion, for example as one might do by stretching out one’s arm and forefi nger in chastising a disobedient dog, augments and enables the result desired.29 On a deeper level, Posism was what made possible complete intercourse—Blending—with the elevated denizens of the universe. Each of these entities had a “location” and a pat-tern, as it were, which, when reached and emulated by the magician, allowed contact and intercourse with them. In its highest phase, this was what Randolph called the “Sleep of Sialam,” Blending with the highest of the cosmic entities reachable by man, and drawing in their powers and knowledge:The term Aeth signifi es that fi ne essence which spirits breathe . . . which cushions the worlds . . .; it is inhaled by Æthereal people precisely as we of earth draw in the effl uence of matter in its grosser and lower forms. No real, divine, or celestial, mental or loving energy can come until by patient and continued effort the Neophyte learns to inhale it; simultane-ously with the fi rm fi xity of the mind upon what is in and of it, therefore we contact the essence of power and the denizens of the ethereal and far-off countries and climes.* * *None of these [ powers] spring up from within us, but all are reachable by us, and fl ow into us in our highest moments; and all or any knowledge or power the human being has a brain capable of holding can be drawn to it, if willed, wished, desired and commanded, as and when aforesaid; and it or they enter the soul only in the moment, at the very instant, of the holy, full, mutual and pure orgasm, or ejection of the three fl uids and two auras . . . and the dual magnetism evolved.3029 Ibid., 90.30 Randolph [Anonymous], Ansairetic Mystery."},{"pageNumber":387,"pageContent":"364 john patrick deveneyThis indrawing of wisdom, power, and knowledge from the higher realms of the celestial hierarchy is the supreme achievement of Ran-dolph’s sexual magic, and its effects vivify and restore both the soul and the body:[A]t the very instant his seminal glands contract to expel their treasures, at such instant his interior nostrils open, and minute ducts, which are sealed at all other times, then expand, and as the lightning from his soul darts from the brain, rushes down the spinal-cord, leaps the solar plexus, plunges along the nerval fi laments to the prostate gland to immortalize the germinal human being; and while the vivifi c pulse is leaping to the dark chamber wherein soul is clothed in fl esh and blood, at that instant he breathes in through the inner nostrils one of two atmospheres underly-ing, inter-penetrating—as the spirit does the body—the outer air which sentient things inhale. One of these auras is deeply charged with, because it is the effl uvium of, the unpleasant sphere of the border spaces, where is congregated the quintessence of evil from every inhabited human world in the entire congeries of soul-bearing galaxies of the broad universe; else he draws in the pellucid aroma of divinity from the far-off multiple heavens.31Directly related to this drawing in of the powers of the celestial hier-archy is the further mystery of implanting the seeds of those powers in a human foetus during the sexual act in order to create a superior child. Never made explicit in all this is the existence of actual sexual intercourse with celestial entities. The possibility certainly exists, given the ambivalence that permeates the idea of Blending in the fi rst place: that is, mental interpenetration and sexual union. Randolph seems to have rung out the changes of this theme, at least to the extent of admit-ting the possibility of sexual intercourse with the spirit of a deceased human,32 and probably to the extent of believing that all Blending, even with the entities of the celestial hierarchy was sexual in nature.33 All this puts Randolph in the select company of Thomas Lake Harris and the Abbé Boullan.Lacking in this breathtaking recital of the possibilities of sexual magic are the explicit details of the sexual practice (postures, times, invocations, and the like) actually employed. These must have existed 31 Randolph, Eulis, 101.32 See, e.g., [Randolph], “Randolph’s Letters—No. 7”.33 While Randolph is silent on the point, his disciple Maria de Naglowska obviously thought enough of the possibility to append to her Magia Sexualis a warning against the dangers of incubi and succubi, while Ruben Swinburne Clymer openly advocated the practice."},{"pageNumber":388,"pageContent":" paschal beverly randolph and sexual magic 365and been communicated by Randolph orally to his followers, but if they were ever committed to writing, they have not survived (except possibly in the later works of Maria de Naglowska and others that purport to contain the specifi c techniques of the practice).It is impossible to say where Randolph acquired these ideas and their astonishing application. Eros and its power are a standard topos in the Hermetic, Neoplatonic, and later magical literature,34 and Randolph had some familiarity with those traditions;35 but the practical applica-tion of Eros to magical achievement was seldom made in terms easily discernable through the veil of time, and Randolph is unlikely to have created his sexual magic from the pages of books. Randolph claimed at times that the idea came from the Near East, from the secret teachings of the Nusairi into which he had been initiated in Egypt or Syria, but in different moods he denied the idea and stressed his own creativity and originality as the sole source. While there are Near Eastern magi-cal techniques based on sex that have some similarity to Randolph’s,36 the issue can not be resolved.The power of sex, coupled with psychoactive drugs, was the genie that Randolph let out of the bottle and revealed to the book-bound would-be magicians of the nineteenth century; and once freed it could not be put back. Indeed it was this idea and its practical techniques (and not merely his visionary recitals) that Randolph bequeathed to poster-ity. While there are other streams of occult practical tradition in the nineteenth century (notably that derived from Cagliostro), Randolph is the main source of the revival that by 1900 transformed occultism and magic from antiquarianism to the almost exclusively practical matter that we know today.There is pathetic evidence that Randolph tried to organize his groups and preserve his teachings in a formal way in order to pass something of value along to his infant son, but the attempts came to naught and his work passed to the next generation through the teachings of his few students (Freeman B. Dowd—the unheralded father of New Thought—most notably) and, most importantly, through his published and private writings. These gave rise a few years after his death in 1875 to the H.B. of L. (the Hermetic Brotherhood of Luxor), which copied 34 See, e.g., Couliano, Eros and Magic in the Renaissance.35 He published, for example, the seventeenth-century translation of the Corpus Hermeticum by Dr. Everard (Hermes Trismegistus: His Divine Pymander).36 See, e.g., “Paul de Régla,” El Ktab des Lois Secrètes de l’Amour."},{"pageNumber":389,"pageContent":"366 john patrick deveneyhis teachings almost literally and, like him, ignored the theoretical side of occultism.37 In France, his secret teachings appeared in the works of Maria de Naglowska in the 1930s, and they survived in the United States in the still-existing Brotherhood of Rosicrucians founded by Reuben Swinburne Clymer.By 1900 the transformation that Randolph had set in motion was complete, and if occultists and magicians still perused the heavy tomes of the western magical tradition, it was with an eye toward discerning practical techniques rather than sterile nuggets of lore, and, surpris-ingly often, with an eye prepared to fi nd and appreciate the role of sex in magical practice.BibliographyAnonymous, The Celestial Telegraph; or, Secrets of the Life to Come Revealed Through magnetism: Wherein the Existence, the Form, the Occupations, of the Soul after its Separation from the Body are Proved by Many Years’ Experiments, by the Means of Eight Ecstatic Somnambulists, who had Eighty Perceptions of Thirty-Six Deceased Persons of Various Conditions.

It is a secret that has been kept intact for centuries, but it is of supreme importance, actually indispensable for understanding the real essence of Christianity and the hidden develop-ment of Western culture. It can give you the key to penetrating the core of all religious traditions in the world. Here it is: during the Last Supper, it is not bread and wine that Jesus Christ gave to the apostles as symbols of his body and of his blood. What Jesus really offered on that occasion, which was to become the model for the central ceremony of Christianity for centuries to come, was his sperm. Since then the practice of spermatophagy (literally, the eating of sperm) has been the central, albeit hidden ritual practice of the Catholic priesthood. But references to this practice can also be found in all the religious tradi-tions of the world.What I have just described is, in a nutshell, the thesis that a Bel-gian spiritualist, the Chevalier Georges Le Clément de Saint-Marcq (1865–1956), presented to the world in a pamphlet fi rst published in 1906, L’Eucharistie. Is it possible to think of anything more scandalous, outrageous, indeed bewildering for the average Christian believer, whatever his or her denomination? Yet Le Clément de Saint-Marcq was intimately convinced that he had discovered a truth of supreme importance for the progress and the welfare of humanity, and that it was his duty to spread it as widely as possible, using all the resources that his intelligence and his personal fortune could offer him. This he did, stubbornly and tirelessly, over a period that spanned most of his adult life. He had to pay a high price for it, but his unwavering, if eccentric, commitment has made him one of the most enigmatic fi gures in the history of modern Western esotericism.* I wish here to thank William Breeze and Peter-R. König for reading a draft ver-sion of the present article and commenting on it."},{"pageNumber":393,"pageContent":"370 marco pasiThere are two main reasons for this. On the one hand, his ideas have been interpreted in the framework of the development of “sexual magic,” a new phenomenon that emerged in occultism around the mid-nineteenth century.1 As a result, Le Clément de Saint Marcq has acquired a kind of legendary status among authors interested in this topic. On the other hand, and despite this legendary status, scholars have not paid him enough attention, hence a veil of mystery still surrounds his fi gure and works.2 Most of the authors who have written about him repeat a series of statements that, although not necessarily false, have never been proven to be true either. Le Clément’s biography remains largely uncharted territory, and his works still need to be seriously studied and analysed. He has been considered as a fundamental source for the development of sexual magic in twentieth-century occultism, but no one has yet attempted to reconstruct his intellectual profi le or give a comprehensive overview of his ideas. In short, he has not been adequately understood, and his role in the history of modern western sexual magic still needs to be assessed. In this chapter I will offer a brief overview of the problems related to Le Clément’s role in the history of sexual magic. These are the fi rst results of an ongoing research project on Le Clément’s life and works in which I am currently engaged.1 Apart from some of the essays collected in the present volume, scholarly studies that have tackled the subject as a phenomenon per se, even if focusing only on par-ticular aspects or authors, are very few. We can mention here Introvigne, Il ritorno dello gnosticismo, Deveney, Paschal Beverley Randolph, Urban, Magia Sexualis, and Urban, “Magia Sexualis.” Urban’s book, Magia Sexualis, is now the most complete historical overview of the phenomenon of sexual magic from a scholarly point of view and offers many important insights into the subject. However, the picture it presents is also partial, focusing mostly on Anglo-American material and neglecting (with the exception of Julius Evola) some very signifi cant developments of sexual magic in continental Europe (such as in France, Germany, and Italy). On a more popular level, Francis King’s book, Sexuality, Magic and Perversion, is now dated and also focuses only on the English-speaking area. S. Alexandrian’s work, La Magie sexuelle is, on the other hand, more comprehen-sive, and offers interesting insight and a useful overview of the topic. A comprehensive scholarly history of the phenomenon still has to be written.2 So far, the best scholarly treatment of Le Clément has been by Introvigne in his Il ritorno dello gnosticismo, 155–160. The same elements presented in that book have later been used by the same author for an article in French, “Le Clément de Saint-Marcq.” Before Introvigne, Helmut Möller and Ellic Howe had dedicated to Le Clément a couple of well-informed pages in their biography of Theodor Reuss, Merlin Peregrinus, 179–180. The “legend” of Le Clément has been built mostly on the basis of two contemporary sources: René Guénon, L’Erreur spirite, 321–327; and Pierre Geyraud (pseud. of Pierre Guyader), L’Occultisme à Paris, 109–120, to which we will return later. To this we should add a letter written in 1950 by the German occultist Henri Birven (1883–1969) to an ex-disciple of Aleister Crowley, Gerald Yorke (1901–1983), which has been quoted at length in Möller’s and Howe’s biography of Reuss referred to above (180)."},{"pageNumber":394,"pageContent":" the knight of spermatophagy 371A Short BiographyAt one point in his life Le Clément became a fi gure of some public importance in his country, and this was not only due to his controversial ideas about the Eucharist. Yet, he has been almost completely forgot-ten after his death. In order to obtain a more precise picture of his life and career it was therefore necessary to search for contemporary sources, either printed or in archives. The turning point in my research was the identifi cation of some of his descendants who kindly assented to an interview.3 They have also put at my disposal their private col-lection of documents and books related to their ancestor. These have proven invaluable.4Georges-Philippe-Alphonse-Marie-Alexandre Le Clément de Saint-Marcq was born in Jodoigne, Belgium, on May 12, 1865 to Alexandre Joseph II (1829–1873) and Anne-Catherine Staes (1833–1913). His father belonged to an aristocratic family with a military background. He was a cavalry offi cer in the Belgian army. His title of “Chevalier” (more common in Belgium than in other European countries) had been confi rmed by William I, King of the unifi ed Netherlands, in 1827, that is, a few years before Belgium became an independent state.5 We do not know where Georges spent the early years of his life.3 The two brothers and one sister I have interviewed descend directly from one of Le Clément’s daughters, Madeleine-Jeanne (1888–1972), who in 1908 married Regnier (or René) Vivario (1887–1970), a professor of toxicological chemistry at the University of Liège. After Le Clément’s death in 1956, the couple inherited his estate at Waltwilder, on which more will be said below. The estate was sold after Madeleine-Jeanne’s death. The descendants whom I have met and interviewed, Mr Michel Vivario, Mr Philippe Vivario, and Mrs Françoise Vivario-Roussaux (whom I wish to thank here for their generous support during my research), have all known Le Clément personally and lived in the same house with him, the older among them being 21 when Le Clément died. The interview took place on May 20, 2005, and will be referred to as “Interview with the Vivarios” (abbr. as IV).4 Hereinafter referred to as “Fonds Vivario” (abbr. as FV). The collection appears to be incomplete, as it contains documents related almost exclusively to the period between Le Clément’s birth and the end of the First World War. Moreover, it unfor-tunately contains almost nothing concerning Le Clément’s involvement with occultism and spiritualism, although he played a very prominent role in those movements in Belgium for many years. His correspondence with friends or colleagues on these mat-ters must have been very extensive, but no traces of it have survived in Le Clément’s own extant papers.5 In the Belgian National Biography, there is an entry on Georges’ great-uncle, Philippe-Auguste-Joseph Le Clément de Saint-Marcq (1762–1831), who was one of the most important Belgian men-of-arms in the service of the crown of Spain before and during the Napoleonic wars, when Belgium lost its status as an Austrian dominion."},{"pageNumber":395,"pageContent":"372 marco pasiGeorges’ father died when he was only eight as the result of a horse fall, and his mother remarried in 1876. We do not know what effects these dramatic events had on young Georges and how they infl uenced his childhood. He fi rst attended a private school in Brussels and at twelve entered the Athénée Royal, the standard secondary school in Belgium.6 He was a brilliant student, excelling especially in mathemat-ics. After completing his secondary education, Le Clément opted for a military career. He entered the Ecole Militaire (Military School) in 1881 and remained there until 1886.7 Having completed his training, he was assigned to the Corps of Engineers (Régiment du Génie), where he would spend the rest of his military career. While attending the Military School, he was probably also following courses at the Ecole Polytechnique of the Université Libre de Bruxelles (ULB), where he studied mathematical and physical sciences and received a doctorate in 1885.8 In 1886, he married Marie van Cauwenberghe (1862–1943), from whom he would have three children: a boy (who died in infancy) and two daughters, Madeleine and Jeanne. His wife was a devout Catholic and hardly approved of the interest that her husband would See van Arenbergh, “Le Clément de Saint-Marcq.” An overview of the genealogical tree of the family of Le Clément, with all its various lines and branches, can be found in Coomans de Brachène, Etat présent de la noblesse belge, 217–228. Clerbois, who quotes from an earlier edition of the same book, erroneously assumes that Le Clément’s title of Chevalier dated back only to Georges’ grandfather (Contribution à l’étude, 150). In fact, it appears from both sources quoted above that the title of the family was signifi cantly older, dating back at least to the time of Louis XIV.6 In FV are preserved Georges’ school report for the private school (“Institution Libre”) in 1876–1877, and two booklets (Procès-verbal de la distribution des prix faite aux élèves) containing the records of the best students of the Athénée Royal of Brussels in 1879 and 1880. Le Clément’s name is mentioned there several times.7 See his “Extrait de matricule,” of the Régiment du Génie, archives of the Konin-klijk Museum van het Leger en de Krijgsgeschiedenis (KMLK), Brussels. I wish to thank Arjuna Ruiz Sanchez for providing me with a copy of the fi le on Le Clément’s military career preserved in these archives. The dates 1881–1886 are also to be found hand-written on a photo of Le Clément taken during the period of his training, which shows young Le Clément, probably not yet twenty, in a military uniform (FV). The hand-written note has clearly been added much later, probably by one of his descen-dants. Other pictures from the same family collection, dating from the same period, portray him with his young comrades of the Military School.8 See the “Notice biographique,” in Le Clément de Saint-Marcq, La Science de l’Immortalité, 3. This biographical note, very probably written by Le Clément himself, is one of the most important direct sources for his early life. Concerning Le Clément’s possible studies at the ULB, the author hiding himself under the pesudonym of “Dédale,” in “La ‘Compagnie des Aérostiers,’ ” 12, refers to Le Clément as a “brillant polytechnicien.”"},{"pageNumber":396,"pageContent":" the knight of spermatophagy 373soon develop for Freemasonry, occultism, and spiritualism, not to men-tion his ideas about spermatophagy.9Le Clément was clearly not an average offi cer in the Belgian army. He was brilliant and ambitious and developed a special interest in the possibilities of human fl ight, about which he was trying to develop new ideas. In the 1880s, when Le Clément began to get involved in the related experiments and studies then conducted by the Belgian government, human fl ight still consisted mostly of relatively short ascensions with infl atable balloons or dirigibles. One of the aims of the experiments was, unsurprisingly, to test the possibility of its mili-tary application. In 1888, when Le Clément was twenty-three, he was put in charge of a section of the Corps of Engineers specialising in captive balloons,10 which at this time mostly had the task of determin-ing the enemy’s position and assessing his strategical defences.11 Not only did Le Clément participate actively in the experiments, he also contributed to the theoretical study of the problems related to human fl ight. His researches and experiments were presented in a thorough essay, Applications des procédés de station et de navigation aériennes à l’art de la guerre (Applications of the Procedures of Aerial Station and Navigation to the Art of War), published in 1893 as a special issue of the Revue de l’Armée Belge. Two years later, he edited a volume on human fl ight published under the auspices of the Société Royale de Géographie d’Anvers, of which he had been appointed general secretary.12 In the following years, while his military career advanced steadily, Le Clément continued studying the topic, and in 1907 he announced the conception of “a new airship on a new principle.”13 Although the announcement was bold enough to attract the attention of the international press, we do not know what became of this new invention or if it ever reached the stage of actual construction. 9 IV.10 “Captive balloons” were aerostatical balloons which remained tied to the ground by one or more ropes, thus avoiding their uncontrollable drifting caused by the winds. They are still used today for meteorological purposes.11 “Dédale,” “La ‘Compagnie des Aérostiers’ ” (1977), 10.12 Le Clément de Saint-Marcq (ed.), Congrès de l’atmosphère. He also contributed a chapter to the volume, “Expériences et théorie sur les hélices aériennes,” in which he reported the results of his experiments with propellers applied to dirigible balloons.13 The news was reported in the European edition of the New York Herald Tribune, Dec. 5, 1907. FV contains a cutting from the same journal, dated Dec. 5, 1957, where the paragraph is reprinted in a section titled “Fifty Years Ago in the European Edi-tion.” I have not been able to consult the original version."},{"pageNumber":397,"pageContent":"374 marco pasiIn 1887, Le Clément entered Freemasonry. He was initiated in the Antwerp lodge of the Belgian Grand Orient, “Les Amis du Commerce et la Perséverance Réunis,” and in 1888 he received the degree of Mas-ter Mason.14 At the time when Le Clément joined the Antwerp lodge, Belgian Freemasonry was recruiting its members almost exclusively among those who shared progressive, liberal, and anticlerical views.15 Le Clément’s decision to become a Freemason therefore gives us a clear indication as to his ideas and attitudes at the time. These turn out to be, as a matter of fact, all but consistent with his later views on religion and politics, as he would express them in his numerous writings.In the following years, Le Clément’s masonic career, like his military one, progressed steadily. In 1890 he entered the Antwerp chapter of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite, the “Vaillants Chevaliers de l’Âge d’Or” (attached to the Grand Orient lodge of which he was already a member). In April 1904, he was promoted “Chevalier Kadosh,” 30°; and fi nally, in March 1910, he was elected to the highest degree of the Rite, the 33°, thereby joining the national Supreme Council.16 With this last achievement, coming only two years before the storm provoked by his pamphlet on the Eucharist, Le Clément became a member of the very restricted masonic elite of his country.17According to his own account, it was in 1893 that Le Clément began to develop a serious interest in spiritualism, which, apart from his profes-sional duties, would become his main preoccupation for the rest of his life.18 He fi rst got involved in the occultist milieus that developed in Bel-gium during the 1890s, especially under the infl uence of contemporary French occultist authors such as Papus (Gérard Encausse, 1865–1916), Stanislas de Guaïta (1861–1897), and Joséphin Péladan (1858–1918). 14 See the masonic chart dated Dec. 4, 5888 (corresponding to 1888, according to masonic usage), in FV.15 See Brodsky, “Belgique,” 72.16 All the information on Le Clément’s masonic career given here has been gathered from his masonic diplomas preserved in FV.17 This had also been noted by René Guénon, who referred to Le Clément as a “haut dignitaire de la Maçonnerie belge” [a high dignitary of Belgian Masonry] (Gué-non, L’Erreur spirite, 324). It is unclear what were his sources on this point, although it is likely that he used information found in the anti-masonic press. In 1913, when the scandal about the L’Eucharist was already in full swing, the Revue Internationale des Sociétés Secrètes included Le Clément’s name in a partial list of members of the Belgian Supreme Council.

In 1890, a Belgian section of the Groupe Indépendant d’Etudes Esotériques (GIEE) was created in Brussels under the name Kumris (or Kvmris).20 The GIEE was a sort of “occultist university”21 that had been created only a few months earlier, in December 1889, by Papus.22 Many French occultists of the period were involved in this group, which offered to its members classes on all “occult” subjects, such as kabbalah, magic, hermetism, alchemy, astrology, and so on. Experiments in psychical powers and spiritualist activities were also allowed, although Papus considered spiritualism to be different from, and inferior to, occultism. But the main purpose of the GIEE was to serve as a kind of recruiting platform for other organisations, reserved for an elite of dedicated members whose esoteric activities would be more discreet than those of the GIEE. These were the neo-rosicrucian 19 See Clerbois, Contribution à l’étude; id. “Symbolisme et franc-maçonnerie” and “L’infl uence de la pensée occultiste.” Clerbois has also shown how the tensions that soon arose between de Guaïta and Papus on the one hand, and Péladan on the other, infl uenced their disciples and admirers in Belgium, who often decided to support one or the other of the two camps.20 As noted by Clerbois, the foundation of this Belgian branch was announced in Papus’ journal L’Initiation, in the August 1890 issue (p. 468). See Clerbois, Contribution à l’étude, 146. As we will see, the name of this group has been repeatedly associated with that of Le Clément and has acquired a kind of mythical status. What has been missed by most authors so far is that the history of Kumris falls apart into two separate periods, and that Le Clément himself appears to be the only (indirect) link between the two. In his dissertation, Clerbois has provided the most reliable and complete historical account of the fi rst period of the group (see ibid., 145–187), but he seems unaware of the existence of a second period. A history of the second Kumris remains to be written and is made particularly diffi cult by the scarcity of relevant primary sources. In 1940, the famous French bookseller Louis Dorbon listed and shortly described, in his famous sale catalogue of esoteric works, a very important set of documents related to the fi rst period of Kumris, which had been collected by the secretary of the group, Nicolas Brossel. See “Kvmris.” (I wish to thank Dominique Clairembault for having drawn my attention to this source) The present location of this collection is unknown, but it is obvious that our knowledge of the history of the fi rst period of Kumris would be greatly improved if it were made available to scholars. According to Clerbois, the name Kumris was derived from Celtic mythology (or, more correctly, from the name of an ancient Celtic population), see ibid., n. 603. Also ibid., Clerbois notes an appar-ent mistake by Papus’ biographer, Beaufi ls, who oddly locates Kumris’ headquarters in Antwerp instead of Brussels (see André & Beaufi ls, Papus biographie, 91).21 Laurant, “Papus,” 914.

It has been suggested that he had a leading role in the group,25 but this calls for some qualifi cations. Certainly Le Clément moved in the occultist circles that were taking shape in the early 1890s in Brussels, including Kumris. Yet while Kumris’ activities took place in Brussels, it would appear that Le Clément spent much more time in Antwerp, where his regiment was posted.26 As we have seen, it was also in an Antwerp lodge that he had been initiated into Freemasonry. His activities would be mainly centred in that city at least until the outbreak of the First World War.If Kumris was the Brussels branch of the Papusian movement, in March 1892 a new Belgian branch was created in Antwerp under the name “Viscum.”27 It is especially in this branch that Le Clément was involved. As a member of this group, Le Clément took the pseudonym “Michaël.” At the beginning, the group was lead by G. de Rosport, who died in 1895 during a scientifi c expedition in Congo (which was then being colonized by the King of Belgium, Leopold II). During deRosport’s absence, the direction of the group was given ad interim to Rosport’s father, but after his death it passed on to young Le Clément.23 See André & Beaufi ls, Papus biographie, 57.24 Papus claimed to have received, from two different sources, an initiation that had its ultimate origin, through an unbroken chain, in Saint-Martin himself. The story of Papusian and post-Papusian neo-Martinism is extremely complicated. As an introduc-tion, see Introvigne, “Martinism: second period,” and the sources mentioned in its bibliography. The latter does not include the recent work by Harvey, Beyond Enlightenment, which provides a comprehensive (and sometimes problematic) treatment of Martinism as a whole, with special attention to its political implications.25 See, for instance, König, Der O.T.O. Phänomen Remix, 501, n. 2766. Part of the ambiguity derives from the fact that, as already pointed out, the difference between the two periods of Kumris has been missed by most authors so far.26 His military record says that in September 1894 he was appointed “Adjoint au Commandant du Génie de l’enceinte d’Anvers,” but it is likely that Antwerp was his place of residence also before that date. See the “Extrait de matricule,” KMLK, Brus-sels, quoted above in note 7.27 See “Groupe Indépendant d’Etudes Esotériques,” 271–272; and Vurgey, “Rapport du Délégué Général,” 75. See also Clerbois, Contribution à l’étude, 166. Later on, another branch was created in Liège, with the name “Pollux.” See De Selliers de Moranville, “Kvmris”; and Fiévet, “Pollux.”"},{"pageNumber":400,"pageContent":" the knight of spermatophagy 377When Le Clément took up the leadership of Viscum, the main branch in Brussels, Kumris, had already been shaken by dissension and personal strife. As we have noted, this was partly a local refl ection of the confl ict that was occurring at the headquarters in Paris after Péladan had chosen to distance himself from his friend de Guaïta and from the Papusian movement.28 In this delicate situation, Vurgey, the head of Kumris but also the general leader of the Papusian movement in Belgium, chose to side with Péladan and consequently had to resign. Kumris did not survive for long after these events. It was dissolved between the end of 1895 and the beginning of 1896. Around the same time that Kumris disappeared from the scene, Papus appointed Le Clément as his general delegate for Belgium for the GIEE and the Martinist Order. Clearly, Le Clément’s qualities as leader of Viscum had impressed Papus.29 At his relatively young age, he now found him-self head of the whole Papusian movement for Belgium. However, Le Clément did not maintain this position of leadership for a long time, for in February 1898 the position of general delegate was transferred to someone else, probably Jules Fiévet.30We do not know what became of the Papusian movement in Belgium after this date. In any case, Le Clément’s career in it had clearly come to an end. He may have realised at one point that occultism and spiri-tualism were two different paths, and that a choice between the two had to be made. He chose for the latter and would never consider himself 28 See above, n. 19. On the situation in Paris, see also Laurant, L’Esotérisme chrétien, 140–143.29 Papus’ positive impressions were confi rmed when he received the detailed report of the activities of Viscum for the year 1895–1896, already quoted above. After read-ing it, he decided it deserved special praise in the pages of L’Initiation: “Par décision spéciale . . . la branche Viscum d’Anvers . . . recevra un Grand diplôme d’honneur pour le résumé et la publication des travaux de la Branche durant l’année 1895–1896.” [By special decision . . . the branch Viscum in Antwerp . . . will receive a grand honorary diploma for its report and the publication of the workings of the branch during the year 1895–1896] (Papus, “Ordre du jour du Centre”). But Le Clément himself also deserved a personal token of consideration for his commitment: “Le délégué général pour la Belgique, Michaël, recevra un diplôme d’honneur pour le succès avec lequel il a dirigé le mouvement ésotérique en Belgique, depuis sa nomination” [The General Delegate for Belgium, Michaël, will receive an honorary diploma for the success with which, since his nomination, he has led the esoteric movement in Belgium] (ibid.). Alas, the mentioned diploma, if it was ever sent, has not survived among Le Clément’s papers preserved by the family.30 See “Ordre Martiniste,” 209. The report says that the new general delegate is in Liege and that his name is “Tekel.” The leader of the Liege branch Pollux was Jules Fiévet, about whom we do not have further information.

Whatever may have been his reasons for distancing himself from the Papusian movement, Le Clément’s com-mitment to heterodox spirituality did not end there. Quite the contrary, it is likely that part of the Antwerp group that he was leading under Papus continued to exist and to follow his leadership in the years that followed, while its activities were being reoriented towards an exclusive interest in spiritualism and all occultist or esoteric pursuits were being abandoned.Le Clément put much energy in establishing an organised movement of spiritualism in Belgium.31 His efforts were appreciated to the extent that, around 1905, he became president of the Fédération Spirite Natio-nale Belge, which comprised most of the local spiritualist organizations in Belgium and became by far the most important spiritualist body in the country. Then, in 1906, he issued a fi rst edition of L’Eucharistie, which apparently did not at fi rst circulate in Belgium.32 It was only when it began to be distributed in his country six years later, around 1912, that Le Clément’s problems began. The pamphlet created a huge scandal, both in spiritualist circles and in Catholic ones. Belgian spiritualism, which had been unifi ed and organised under Le Clément’s leadership, underwent a schism. The great majority of Belgian spiritualists opposed the ideas expressed in the pamphlet and went their own way, while a tiny minority preferred to side with Le Clément. Later, further schisms ensued and confl icts kept emerging in Belgian spiritualism until well after the First World War. It would be fair to say that the movement never recovered from the shock. In order to propagate his ideas, Le Clément had created a journal, which was fi rst called Bulletin mensuel du Bureau permanent d’étude des phénomènes spirites [ Monthly Bulletin of the Permanent Offi ce for the Study of Spiritualist Phenomena] but in 1913 changed its name to Le Sincériste. This monthly periodical continued to be published, fi lled almost single-handedly by Le Clément, until 1947, 31 The only study of Belgian spiritualism of which I am aware is an unpublished Master thesis: van Branden, De receptie van het spiritisme. It is informative but given its purpose it offers obviously a very partial overview of the subject, and, strangely enough, neglects almost entirely Le Clément’s fundamental role in this story.32 A copy of the fi rst (undated) edition is at the French National Library (shelfmark: D2–17805), bearing a library stamp dated June 7, 1906. It is possible that Le Clément himself sent the copy to the library. I have made no systematic attempt at fi nding other copies of this edition of the booklet in other French or European libraries. Sig-nifi cantly, I have found no copies of this fi rst edition at the Royal Library in Brussels.

The journal experienced only two interruptions during the two world wars.It is likely that the scandal of L’Eucharistie did not have effects simply on Le Clément’s leadership of Belgian spiritualism. It appears, in fact, that his career in both Freemasonry and the army also ended around the time of the scandal. No evidence has surfaced so far to indicate that all these events were related, but the chronological coincidence is highly suggestive. Around 1910, Le Clément was the most prominent fi gure of Belgian spiritualism, a high-ranking Freemason, and an army offi cer with excellent career prospects. By the time of the outbreak of the First World War all of this had gone, and it is hard to imagine that the scandal caused by L’Eucharistie did not play a major role in this abrupt end to Le Clément’s fortunes. Obviously, he paid a high price for his stubborn conviction of having discovered in spermatophagy the most important secret in the history of humanity.We do not know much about Le Clément’s life after the beginning of the First World War. We know that he was recalled in the army and was involved in the fi rst military operations after the German invasion of his country but was soon discharged again. After the war, he retired and lived in the small village of Waltwilder in the Belgian province of Limburg, where he owned a property and where he would spend the rest of his life with his family. Having retired, he could devote most of his time to his studies and publications. He remained very active and, apart from his journal Le Sincériste, continued to publish books and pamphlets on spiritualism and other subjects, such as the history of religions, in which he often defended and expanded on his ideas about the Eucharist.33 Apparently, he remained in Waltwilder during the Second World War and was not particularly affected by the events. He does not seem to have published anything after the war, apart from Le Sincériste, and in 1947 even this came to an end. Le Clément de Saint-Marc died in 1956 at the age of 91.Seminal IdeasAs we have seen, the fundamental idea contained in L’Eucharistie is that the main liturgical ceremony of Christianity hides a secret.

The starting point of Le Clément’s argument is a passage in the Gospel of John that is considered as one of the scriptural foundations for the institution of the Eucharist.34 In this passage, taken from the discourse held in the synagogue of Capharnaum, Jesus describes himself as the “Bread of Life” sent by his Father ( John 6:47–55). He tells his disciples that only those who will eat his fl esh and drink his blood will receive eternal life. Le Clément takes the passage quite literally and asks his readers how Jesus could let not only his disciples but the whole of humanity eat his fl esh and drink his blood in order to give them eternal life. This seems a physical impossibility. Traditional Catholic theology has answered the question by postulating the real presence of Christ in the host during the Eucharist, while the Protestant churches have generally opted for a symbolic interpretation of this presence.But in Le Clément’s view, they are both wrong—or, more correctly, they have both lied, for they knew that the truth was different. For Le Clément, the only way of making sense of the Gospel passage is by supposing that Jesus was thinking of a real substance that came from his body and could function as spiritual nourishment for his disciples. That substance was his semen. For Le Clément, this solution makes perfect sense. Semen is comestible, half-liquid and half-solid, and, being the vehicle of human procreation, is related to both blood and fl esh. On the other hand, it can be offered to others repeatedly without infl icting injuries upon one’s own body or killing oneself (which would be the case if one were to literally give one’s fl esh and blood). The transmis-sion of semen would also explain the apostolic succession. By ingesting Jesus’ semen, a product of his physical body, his disciples were linked to him. By giving their own semen to others in turn, they could therefore provide an indirect link to Jesus that could be transmitted indefi nitely through the ages. Thus the apostolic succession was not just spiritual, but physical as well, since it was based upon the chain-transmission of this substance. Finally, it would also explain the promise of eternal life made to Jesus’ followers: they had seen that he had conquered death, 34 For what follows, see Le Clément de Saint-Marcq, L’Eucharistie, 11–13.

But there are interesting, and important, corollaries. One question concerns Jesus’ choice of offering precisely his semen to the apostles. Why semen? It turns out that, for Le Clément, this choice was not original with Jesus. In fact, he claims that all traditional religions were already based on the transmission of sperm even before Jesus Christ appeared on the scene.35 This is, of course, a startling revelation and an important aspect of Le Clément’s argument. He claims that the religious practice of spermatophagy has always been universal:There is no country in the world, and not a single race with a glimmer of religious civilization, which has not known these mysteries and where the habitual communion between priests and gods has not been consum-mated according to this rite.36In order to demonstrate this, Le Clément refers to passages from the Old Testament and from the Bhagavad Gītā that supposedly confi rm his thesis. Other evidence can be found in the religion of ancient Egypt and in the traditions of the Druids, of China, Africa, and ancient Mexico. All this, he claims, can only be explained by the fact that the ritual transmission of semen has always been perceived as a convenient means of communicating (in the literal sense of the word, and also the religious one of “communion”) with the divine. Why? Le Clément does not give a clear answer to this question, important though it obviously is, nor does he expand on the intrinsic virtues of human semen that might justify the universality of religious spermatophagy.But another crucial question immediately arises. Le Clément clearly sees the teachings of Jesus as a major turning point in the history of religions. According to him, at the beginning Christianity conveyed a revolutionary message.37 But if spermatophagy was already so universal before Jesus Christ, then what would be so new about Christianity? Why 35 For what follows, see ibid., 13–19.36 “[ I ]l n’est pas une contrée au monde, pas une race ayant eu quelque teinte de civilisation religieuse, qui n’ait connu ces mystères et où la communion habituelle entre les prêtres et les dieux n’ait été consommée selon ce rite.” Ibid., 17.37 In L’Eucharistie Le Clément speaks of the “souffl e niveleur et révolutionnaire de l’Evangile” [egalizing and revolutionary breath of the Gospel] (L’Eucharistie, 7).

This question is not clearly answered in L’Eucharistie, although its premises are already there. It is only in later texts that Le Clément, probably pressed by the criticism of his adversaries, develops it fully.38The point is that, according to Le Clément, spermatophagy, no mat-ter how universal, had been kept hidden by the priests of all previous religious traditions in order to exploit and dominate the rest of human-ity. Jesus decided to make this practice public in order to put an end to their oppressive authority. In so doing, he sparked a revolution that might have had far-reaching consequences, leading to the emancipation of humanity from the lies and the falsities of older religions. But, in the end, his attempt was frustrated by those who institutionalized the Christian movement after his death, that is, of course, by the clergy. Taking control of the movement, they again concealed the secret that Jesus had wanted to unveil before the eyes of the world.39 However, like the clergy of all other religious traditions before them, the Christian clergy were not against spermatophagy as such, but only against it being revealed to the world. This is why the practice was continued secretly in monasteries and among the priests, while for the public liturgy of the Church the innocuous use of bread and wine was adopted. The history of Christianity has therefore been made of two parallel cults: a secret and a public one.40At this point, some remarks must be made about Le Clément’s sup-posed revelations. First of all, he clearly gives a positive evaluation of Jesus, presenting him as a historical fi gure who tried to bring about a revolution that could have democratized religion.41 In his works, Le Clé-ment shows admiration, respect, and even veneration for the fi gure of Jesus Christ.42 Ironically, it would not be absurd to defi ne him, despite his very heterodox position, as a Christian thinker and theologian. But 38 See particularly Le Clément de Saint-Marcq, Dieu, 141–150.39 Ibid., 148–150.40 Le Clément de Saint-Marcq, L’Eucharistie, 9, 26–27.41 “L’objectif fi nal, en vue duquel Jésus a calculé ses actes et ses paroles, semble être l’affranchissement de l’humanité, subjuguée, dominée, exploitée et asservie par la coalition infernale des riches, des prêtres et des rois” [ The fi nal goal, in view of which Jesus has calculated his actions and words, seems to be the liberation of humanity, which has been subjugated, dominated, exploited, and enslaved by the infernal coalition of the rich, the priests, and the kings] (Le Clément de Saint-Marcq, Dieu, 143).42 See for example the chapter “La Tentation de Jésus,” in Le Clément de Saint-Marcq, Dieu, 132–140."},{"pageNumber":406,"pageContent":" the knight of spermatophagy 383there is, of course, an obvious paradox in the history of Christianity according to Le Clément. Although Jesus wanted to create a movement that would oppose traditional religions and break the domination of their clerics over humanity, this movement ended up in being as bad as any religion that preceded it. Le Clément clearly admires Jesus’ attempt at exposing the mysteries and democratizing religion but has to concede that his efforts ended with total failure, because the Christian clergy in the end frustrated Jesus’ revolution.This sharp distinction between Jesus and the clergy of institutional-ized Christianity, between the good intentions of the former and their perversion operated by the latter, is obviously not original with Le Clé-ment. It belongs to an old tradition, which had its roots in medieval movements of reform and had been one of the driving ideological forces of the Reformation. Later on, it became a commonplace of Protestantism in its various denominations and was widely adopted by the Enlightenment and by Deist thinkers in the eighteenth century. Le Clément attacks the Catholic Church because of its reactionary, anti-democratic domination of the masses, which should be emancipated from its infl uence. Its doctrine has perverted the real teachings of Jesus and the purity of the early Christian communities. The Church has hidden the real teachings of Jesus Christ, and it is a moral duty for those who see the truth beneath the veil to expose the abuse. This will put an end to the priestly domination of Catholicism and lead to a great progress of humanity.This description perfectly fi ts the position of the authors discussed by Jonathan Z. Smith in the fi rst chapter of his remarkable book, Drudgery Divine.43 Smith describes the “Protestant anti-Catholic apologetics” of authors such as Joseph Priestley (1733–1804), who attributed the per-version of the original teachings of early Christianity to the infl uence of Platonism and of Greek philosophy, and hence found it diffi cult to even conceive the possibility of a comparison between early Christian-ity and the mystery cults of late Antiquity. Despite all the considerable differences between Le Clément and the authors discussed by Smith, it is interesting to note that in Le Clément’s work as well we fi nd an emphasis on the problematic relationship between early Christianity and the Mysteries. One signifi cant difference (apart from the emphasis on Platonism and Greek philosophy, which is absent in Le Clément) 43 “On the Origins of Origins” in Smith, Drudgery Divine, 1–35."},{"pageNumber":407,"pageContent":"384 marco pasiis that the Belgian author has also some criticism for Protestantism, which he fi nds as hypocritical as the Catholic Church. The reason is that Protestantism has insisted on the difference between the host and the actual body of Christ, which, for Le Clément, amounts to denying the effective value of the spermatic transmission.44It is interesting to note that this distinction between the original teachings of Jesus and the later perversions of the Church was devel-oped in the nineteenth century, particularly within liberal Protestantism, Unitarianism, Deist Freemasonry, and more generally in anti-Catholic and anticlerical circles. In Belgium at the time of Le Clément, these assumptions were widespread not only in Freemasonry, but also in spiritualism.45 In this respect, except for the reference to spermatophagy, Le Clément’s ideas were consonant with the ideas dominant in those movements. It should then come as no surprise that, prior to his revela-tions on spermatophagy, Le Clément could have been a very prominent fi gure in both. At the same time, the idea of spermatophagy, wherever it was coming from, was a radical departure from the kind of arguments advanced in those circles, and, but for a few interesting exceptions, led to a general condemnation of Le Clément and the end of his personal career as a public fi gure. It just went too far.The second remark concerns Le Clément’s vision of history. For him, the whole history of religions, and indeed of humanity, is based on a gigantic lie, a “monstrueux et séculaire complot” [a monstrous and secular conspiracy]46 that he alone has discovered or is willing to expose, probably for the fi rst time since Jesus Christ himself (and, he surely hopes, with better chances of success). Humanity is divided between “sincerists” (sincéristes) and “mensongists” (mensongistes).47 The sincerists are those who, like Le Clément, have discovered the truth of 44 Le Clément de Saint-Marcq, L’Eucharistie, 28–30.45 Within Belgian Freemasonry these ideas had had a signifi cant development in the fi rst half of the nineteenth century, notably in the works of M. Reghellini de Schio (1766–1858) (see Cazzaniga, “Les origines de la Franc-Maçonnerie”). In Reghellini’s works, one fi nds the idea that Catholic priests have perverted the true message of Christ (ibid., 20), and that against this “religious imposture” freemasons “s’organisent dans la tradition des sociétés secrètes pour éduquer le peuple et pour bâtir une société d’hommes libres et égaux” [organize in the tradition of secret societies in order to educate the people and build a society of free and equal men] (ibid., 22). It is signifi cant that a book by Reghellini, Examen du Mosaïsme et du Christianisme (1834), is listed by Le Clément in the bibliography appended to L’Eucharistie.46 Le Clément de Saint-Marcq, Dieu, 60.47 Hence the title of his periodical, Le Sincériste."},{"pageNumber":408,"pageContent":" the knight of spermatophagy 385spermatophagy and, being honest (sincères), are willing to spread the news to the rest of the world. The mensongists are all those who have an interest in keeping the truth hidden from the world and spread the web of lies (mensonges) that holds religious institutions alive. Between these two camps there are the simple-minded persons, the vast major-ity of humanity, who are unaware of the whole issue and who are willing to believe the lies of the mensongists without asking too many questions.This vision is not far removed from the type of conspiracy theories that have recently been made popular by books such as The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail or The Da Vinci Code.48 In all these fi ctionalized accounts of history, the real protagonist is a tremendous secret, known by a tiny minority of persons divided into two groups: those who exploit it in order to achieve and preserve power, and those who want to reveal it and bring to an end the worldly domination of the other party. According to Le Clément, the revelation of the secret of spermatophagy should bring about a new age of peace, understanding, and prosperity, by democratizing religion and society and by breaking the spell cast by the clergy over the vast majority of humanity.This leads us to another important point. In Le Clément’s vision, being a “sincerist” means being against “mysteries,” of whatever kind. This is the reason why, in his writings, the words “mysteries” and “initi-ates” often have a negative connotation: “There exists . . . in the Church and in Religion a principle, and habits of duplicity, which distort their moral infl uence; this failing results from what one calls the mysteries of Religion.”49 These mysteries are actually the basis for the priestly domination over the ignorant masses, and they should all be dispelled: “Only . . . the complete and public divulgation of the mysteries can put a fi nal end to this deplorable situation.”50 We fi nd in Le Clément’s work no appreciation of the value of initiation, or of the idea that initiatic wisdom should be conferred only to those who deserve it and who have been prepared to receive it. Disclosing the mysteries is a matter 48 Baigent, Leigh & Lincoln, The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail; Brown, The Da Vinci Code.49 “Il y a [. . .] dans l’Eglise et dans la Religion un principe et des habitudes de duplicité qui en dénaturent l’infl uence morale; ce défaut résulte de ce que l’on appelle: les mystères de la Religion” (Le Clément de Saint-Marcq, Dieu, 108; see also 57).50 “Seule [. . .] la divulgation complète et publique des mystères peut apporter un terme défi nitif à cette situation deplorable.” Ibid., 148."},{"pageNumber":409,"pageContent":"386 marco pasiof universal emancipation, especially of the lower classes, who have been the most obvious victims of priestly domination.This hostility towards initiation and the “mysteries” is an interesting aspect, because it seems hardly compatible with the common language of esotericists and occultists, where the same terms have rather positive connotations. On the other hand, it does fi t the kind of rhetoric that was widespread among spiritualists. Spiritualism in fact often criticized occultism for its love of mysteries and was against an elitist view of spiritual wisdom. In this sense, it saw itself as more “democratic” and more “progressive” than occultism.51 This makes of course even more apparent that Le Clément made a signifi cant choice when he distanced himself from the Papusian movement.Another signifi cant element is the fact that, in his books and his journal, Le Clément underscores again and again the importance of sexual reform and sexual education, especially for children. In short, Le Clément’s sincerism goes beyond a simple affi rmation of the truth of spermatophagy and also includes a progressive, even radical vision of sexuality, which has important social implications. It should be noted that, on this point at least, Le Clément was close to fi gures like Paschal Beverly Randolph, Theodor Reuss, and Aleister Crowley, who have not only been major characters in the modern history of sexual magic but also held similar views on sexuality.52 At the same time, Le Clément also found himself close to some of the more radical currents of spiritualism, which became outspoken advocates of sexual liberation.53A fi nal point concerns the ambiguous value attached to spermato-phagy. It is important to emphasize that priests are condemned by Le Clément not because they indulge in spermatophagy, but because they do it secretly. The implication seems to be that a positive value is attached to spermatophagy, and that once the secret has been disclosed, everybody could or should practice it. This, at least, is what might be gathered from the text of L’Eucharistie. At one point Le Clément remarks that if all religions in the world have believed that it was possible to establish a contact with the divine through spermatophagy, there must be some truth in it: “Therefore it is not at all just a superstition that 51 On this point, see Pasi, “Occultism.”52 On this point, see Deveney, Paschal Beverley Randolph, passim; Urban, Magia Sexualis, 7–12; Pasi, “Ordo Templi Orientis”, and “Crowley, Aleister.”53 See Braude, Radical Spirits, 56–81, 117–141."},{"pageNumber":410,"pageContent":" the knight of spermatophagy 387this universal belief is able to establish a link between man and God by means of spermatophagy.”54 If religious traditions are not all the result of some kind of universal folly or of a collective mental disease (a possibility that Le Clément seems to exclude), there is only one other possibility: that “at the bottom of these practices there is some seri-ous element, grounded in the nature of things, and that it should be brought to light in a defi nitive and irrefutable manner.”55One may also wonder if any special connection is made by Le Clé-ment between spermatophagy and the practice of spiritualism. He does not say explicitly that spiritualism should make use of spermatophagy, although in L’Eucharistie he comes very close to doing so. He remarks in fact that in all countries and in all periods of history there seem to have existed men who preferred to live their life separated from the rest of society, and especially from women. Very often they have claimed to be in contact with spiritual entities, whose existence is nowadays demonstrated by spiritualism:These men devote themselves to meditation and, to judge from what they say, are in contact with another spiritual population of this world, which is not perceived by our senses but the existence of which seems to be proven by the spiritualist phenomena that are being studied more and more frequently in our days.56Judging from the context in which Le Clément brings this point in, the implication seems to be that the isolated condition of these men was related to the practice of spermatophagy, and that this practice was used to achieve their goal.5754 “Ce n’est donc point une superstition totale que cette croyance universelle à la possibilité d’établir un lien entre l’homme et Dieu par la spermatophagie” (Le Clément de Saint-Marcq, L’Eucharistie, 18).55 “il y a au fond de ces pratiques un élément sérieux, fondé dans la nature des choses, et qu’il conviendrait de mettre en lumière d’une manière défi nitive et irrefu-table” (Ibid.).56 “[C]es hommes se livrent à la méditation et semblent en rapport, selon leurs discours, avec une autre population spirituelle de ce monde que nos sens ne perçoivent pas, mais dont l’existence semble prouvée par les phénomènes spirites de plus en plus étudiés de nos jours” (Ibid., 18–19).57 We should note here in passing that this reference to isolated men practising spermatophagy, seems to have obvious homosexual connotations. We will return to this aspect in the fi nal part of this chapter. We should also add that, from what is known of Le Clément’s life there are no reasons to believe that he ever had homosexual experiences or inclinations."},{"pageNumber":411,"pageContent":"388 marco pasiThus, one could ask, why should Spiritualists not do the same in order to communicate with the spirits? This question is very impor-tant in order to assess the concrete possibility that a ritual use of spermatophagy was practiced or encouraged by Le Clément himself. Whatever his ideological disagreements with occultism, this would of course bring him very close to the practice of a kind of “sexual magic.” Unfortunately, there is no clear answer to this question. First of all, the correlation drawn between the practices of traditional religions with respect to spermatophagy, on the one hand, and spiritualism on the other, is always indirect and never explicit, as, for example, in the pas-sage quoted above. Secondly, at the current state of research we have no evidence whatsoever that Le Clément ever practised spermatophagy himself. Thirdly, if spermatophagy really helps human beings to estab-lish a contact with spiritual entities, Le Clément does not make clear how this is supposed to work. Is it because of some intrinsic power of semen? Does it have to do with certain notions of biological and/or spiritual physiology? Le Clément has left us with no clues as to his views about such questions. Moreover, in other writings he professes to have doubts concerning the practice of spermatophagy and even explicitly rejects the idea that it should be practiced today.58 In a sort of catechism of sincerism he writes: Q. Since the Eucharist has such great virtues, should we practice it? R. No. Q. Why should we not put into practice the command of Jesus Christ? R. Because today it is possible to propagate by words ideas that in the past could not fi nd their way into the world otherwise than by prac-ticing the work of the Eucharist. Q. Why is it preferable to have recourse to verbal propagation? R. Because in that manner one can better clear up people’s minds, openly attack false ideas and immoral institutions, the destruction of which was prepared by the Eucharist, and thus act much more effi ciently in the interest of the salvation of humanity.5958 For the fi rst point, see Le Clément de Saint-Marcq, . . .

If so, we should conclude that by declaring spermatophagy as inappropriate and superfl uous for modern man, Le Clément is also excluding any possible use that might be made of it as a ritual technique in the context of sexual magic. In the end, given Le Clément’s reticence in giving his personal opinions as to the actual use of spermatophagy, the question remains open.The Enigma of Le Clément’s EucharistLe Clément’s work represents an enigma for the scholar. His claims seem to be so patently absurd, at least in their grandiose historical implica-tions, that one might be tempted to question his mental sanity. How is it possible that someone of his intelligence and education, someone highly appreciated for his intellectual qualities by his colleagues in all the fi elds in which he was involved, came to develop such a stubborn conviction about the universal secret of spermatophagy?It is important here to note that Le Clément’s claim was also of a historical nature. It is not his belief in the existence of a spiritual dimen-sion or in the possibility of communicating with the spirits of the dead that is at issue here. Such beliefs might be considered “irrational,” but could hardly be a suffi cient basis for making any statement concerning Le Clément’s mental health. The implications of Le Clément’s ideas go much farther than that, as they assume the universal presence of a practice, spermatophagy, for which no apparent evidence seems to be available. Yet Le Clément wants to convince his readers that this evidence can be found everywhere, and that nobody else has seen it before him. That spermatophagy has been practised in certain par-ticular historical contexts may be considered a fair assumption. But that it is the basis of all religions since the origins of humanity seems patently absurd.One could imagine that Le Clément was a essentially a “rabid anticlerical,” whose scandalous ideas were just an (admittedly odd) excuse for attacking the Catholic Church, a kind of smokescreen for his real, hidden agenda.60 Perhaps by spreading these rumours he et les institutions malsaines dont l’Eucharistie ne faisait que preparer la ruine, et on agit ainsi d’une façon beaucoup plus effi cace pour le salut de l’humanité” (Le Clément de Saint-Marcq, “Faites votre salut,” 2).60 The defi nition of Le Clément as a “rabid anticlerical” (“anticlericale arrabbiato”)"},{"pageNumber":413,"pageContent":"390 marco pasiwas just hoping to harm the reputation of the Catholic Church but himself did not really believe in their truth. If we were to follow this line of interpretation, we would be obliged to think that Le Clément’s appeals for sincerity and against falsehood were but an ironic twist in his deliberate program of deception.It is true that in the history of anticlericalism we fi nd a number of examples of this sort of duplicity. A quite obvious case was chronologi-cally close to Le Clément and could provide us with a good term of comparison. I am referring to Léo Taxil’s (ps. of Gabriel Jogand-Pagès, 1854–1907) complicated sequence of deceptions and revelations, whose fi nal aim was to render the anti-masonic attitude of the Catholic Church ridiculous.61 After having been active in anticlerical circles, Taxil had in fact claimed to have converted to Catholicism and then published a series of revelations on a world-wide satanic conspiracy of freemasons. These publications were quite successful, and despite the improbable details found in some of them, they were taken for absolute truth by a large number of unsuspecting Catholics. Eventually Taxil announced publicly that he had been inventing his stories from scratch, with the sole purpose of showing how gullible Catholics could be. There is, however, at least one important difference between the two stories. Le Clément, much unlike Taxil, publicly defended his ideas, with remark-able consistency, during a considerable period of time. At least from 1906, when his pamphlet on the Eucharist was fi rst published, until his last publications forty years later. There is no evidence that Le Clément ever doubted the truthfulness of his claims, and he did not signifi cantly modify them during his life.If we suppose that Le Clément really believed in his ideas, and that the real impulse behind his publications was a candid, honest belief in their truthfulness, the problem remains unsolved. What might lie at the origin of Le Clément’s sincere beliefs? Was it erudite research? A connection between the rite of the Eucharist and spermatophagy had been made before, by early Church heresiologists such as Epiphanius of Salamis but was attributed to a “gnostic” sect, the Phibionites, or is by M. Introvigne (Il ritorno dello gnosticismo, 156). He relates Le Clément’s discourse, among other things, to the virulence of the polemics of Belgian Freemasonry against the Catholic Church.61 On this point, see Weber, Satan franc-maçon; and Introvigne, Enquête sur le satanisme, 143–208."},{"pageNumber":414,"pageContent":" the knight of spermatophagy 391Borborites.62 The idea may have come from there, and Le Clément does indeed quote Epiphanius in his L’Eucharistie. He argues that Epiphanius, like other early Christian authors, had attributed to the gnostics a prac-tice that was in fact widespread among Christians as well, because by that time the clergy had already taken over the movement founded by Jesus Christ and had betrayed his original message. Christian authors were therefore ashamed to admit publicly what they did in secret and tried to scapegoat the gnostics for this:St. Epiphanius gives a complete description of the eucharistic ceremony, but he attributes it exclusively to the gnostics, and takes care to present it as an aberration unworthy of true Christians; in their meetings, he says, men and women both eat the semen that reproduces the human species while turning towards the altar and saying “Offerimus tibi donum corpus Christi,” “We offer you as sacrifi ce the body of Christ.” But on the one hand, while the scribes paid by the Church thus attempt to save its reputation by projecting the bad reputation of the secret cult onto the heretical sects, on the other hand, the authorities that direct this great social movement make an effort to discipline the meals, impose order on them, and make them less scary for the faithful, so that the idea of the sacrifi ce that they are going to offer to God will be more present to their minds.63Still the question remains: why then apply the practice not only to the Catholic Church, or even generally to Christianity, but to the whole of humanity?A defi nitive answer seems impossible at the present state of research. However, we may come to better understand how Le Clément developed his convictions by considering a detail that has escaped the attention of all previous commentators so far. In 1913, one of Le Clément’s spiritual-ist opponents, one Van Geebergen, publicly stated his opinion that the origin of the ideas presented in L’Eucharistie lay in demonic inspiration. 62 See van den Broek, “Borborites.”63 Le Clément de Saint-Marcq, L’Eucharistie, 25 [“Saint Epiphane donne une descrip-tion complète de la cérémonie eucharistique, mais il l’attribue exclusivement aux gnos-tiques et a soin de la représenter comme une aberration indigne des vrais chrétiens; dans leurs assemblées, dit-il, les hommes et les femmes mangent réciproquement la semence reproductive de l’espèce humaine en se tournant vers l’autel et en disant (au Très-Haut): “Offerimus tibi donum corpus Christi”. “Nous t’offrons en sacrifi ce le corps de Jésus-Christ”. Mais, d’une part, pendant que les scribes à la solde de l’Eglise essaient ainsi de sauver sa réputation en jetant sur des sectes hérétiques le mauvais renom du culte secret, d’autre part, les autorités dirigeant ce grand mouvement social s’efforcent de discipliner les agapes, d’y établir l’ordre, de les rendre moins effrayantes pour les fi dèles, afi n qu’ils aient plus présents à l’esprit l’idée du sacrifi ce qu’il viennent y offrir à Dieu”] (author’s emphasis)."},{"pageNumber":415,"pageContent":"392 marco pasiIn his reply, published in Le Sincériste, Le Clément denied the accusa-tion, but only as far as the “quality” of the inspiration was concerned; in fact, he stated that the secret of spermatophagy had been revealed to him during a spiritualist séance.64 Now if the ideas expressed in the brochure indeed had their origin in a spiritualist communication, the problem referred to above can be seen in different light.65 The com-munication is not mentioned in the text of L’Eucharistie, but probably had a cognitive quality that helped Le Clément to overcome all pos-sible doubts concerning the likelihood of the spermatophagical theory. Unfortunately, however, we lack any details as to the conditions under which this communication took place. We do not even know whether Le Clément was using a medium—and if so, who he or she may have been—or was acting as a medium himself.For some reason, although Le Clément seems to have attached great importance to methodological skepticism in spiritualism, he became convinced that what had been communicated to him during a séance was a historical truth. Presumably it was only afterwards that he tried to “make sense” of the revelation and, to some extent, build a system on it. A comparison with another revelation of a similar kind, Aleis-ter Crowley’s revelation of the Book of the Law, may be useful here.66 In 1904, Crowley received from an entity called Aiwass the text of a book that should become the foundation for the universal religion of the future. The revelation itself gave a new meaning to Crowley’s life and made him feel that the spiritual world had charged him with a mission of supreme importance. After that date, Crowley spent the rest of his life “making sense” of the revelation he had received, writing 64 See G. Le Clément de Saint-Marcq, “Rectifi cation.” See also, . . . Et lux erat!, 8. 65 It also provides a new perspective on Guénon’s discussion of Le Clément (see note 2), which seems to contain some allusions to Spiritualist communications as a background to Le Clément’s doctrine. For example, he discusses a Mr. Paul Pillault, leader of a spiritualist sect called “Fraternism,” who claimed that Le Clément was merely an “instrument very open to various psychoses” and concluded that “hav-ing been infl uenced, he had to write this brochure and publish it” (Guénon, L’erreur spirite, 323). According to Guénon, in the “Fraternist” terminology “the ‘psychoses’ are ‘invisible infl uences’ (they even use the barbarous word ‘infl uencism’), of which there exist good and bad ones, and all the séances of the Fraternists begin by an invocation to the ‘Good Psychosis’ ” (ibid.). A thorough analysis and commentary of Guénon’s discussion would require more space than is available here.66 For a short introduction to Crowley’s life and ideas, with an essential bibliography, see Pasi, “Crowley, Aleister.” For an interesting discussion on the signifi cance of the revelation of the Book of the Law for Crowley’s life, including comparisons with other similar “revelations,” see Sutin, Do What Thou Wilt, 133–140."},{"pageNumber":416,"pageContent":" the knight of spermatophagy 393hundreds of pages in this enterprise. It is noteworthy that most of the time such revelations seem to confi rm the ideas of the authors who receive them. They are consonant with their world-view, and this makes the task of “making sense” of them easier. At the same time, this task may become all-consuming and carry heavy costs for the personal life of the receiver of the revelation. Such was arguably the case with Crowley, and certainly with Le Clément.The Infl uence of Le Clément’s WorkAs indicated at the beginning of this chapter, several authors have hinted at the importance of Le Clément’s role in the history of sexual magic. In what follows we will focus on the infl uence that Le Clément may have had on two of the most important authors in the history of sexual magic, Theodor Reuss and Aleister Crowley, while leaving a more detailed study of the Belgian and French groups that took shape around Le Clément’s ideas for a future publication.The connection between Le Clément and sexual magic was made quite early. We fi nd it already, if only implicitly, in René Guénon’s book, L’erreur spirite, in which he meticulously, and very critically, investigated the history and ideas of spiritualism. The connection was suggested by, and had some foundation in, the fact that one of the authors actually involved in sexual magic had found inspiration in Le Clément’s booklet, Theodor Reuss, who in 1914 even wrote a letter to Le Clément in order to congratulate him with his publications and to assure him that the sexual secret of the Ordo Templi Orientis was in perfect accordance with what Le Clément has presented in L’Eucharistie. The letter had been printed by Le Clément in his Sincériste and was quoted by Guénon: “I’m sending you two brochures: Orifl ammes [sic], in which you will fi nd that the Order of Oriental Templars has the same knowledge that one fi nds in the brochure L’Eucharistie.”67 In fact, Reuss had mentioned Le Clément’s L’Eucharistie among the fundamental sources for the teachings of the O.T.O., that is, the “treasure-troves of the building-blocks for 67 “Je vous adresse deux brochures: Orifl ammes [sic], dans lesquelles vous trouverez que l’Ordre des Templiers Orientaux a la même connaissance comme on trouve dans la brochure Eucharistie” (Le Clément de Saint-Marcq, “Encore une confi rmation”; see also Guénon, L’Erreur spirite, 324)."},{"pageNumber":417,"pageContent":"394 marco pasithe O.T.O. temple” [ Fundstätten der Bausteine zum O.T.O.-Tempel], at the end of his Parsifal and the Mystery of the Grail Unveiled of 1914.68Howe and Möller, in their biography of Theodor Reuss, remark that there certainly was a “spiritual affi nity” between the two authors.69 Even apart from the fundamental secret of spermatophagy, the ideas of sexual and social reform that were defended by Le Clément in his writings could only appeal to Reuss. Howe and Möller add that there is no evidence of a continued relationship between the two, apart from the letter quoted above, and that their contact probably went no further, perhaps because there was little that Reuss could obtain from Le Clé-ment in terms of practical teachings.70 With Le Clément, everything seemed to be entirely theoretical, while Reuss wanted to develop a system of workable sexual magic.This conclusion seems sound enough, but it is still possible to sup-pose that Reuss took more inspiration from Le Clément’s book for the development of his techniques of sexual magic than one might think at fi rst sight. Elsewhere, we have noted the interesting coincidence that the fi rst signs of Reuss developing a system based on sexual teachings in the frame of his masonic enterprises appeared in 1906, the same year in which L’Eucharistie was fi rst printed and circulated internation-ally (with the probable exclusion of Belgium).71There are some interesting aspects here that should be highlighted. First of all, although spermatophagy as such is not necessarily a homo-sexual practice, the interpretation Le Clément gives of the Eucharist has obvious homosexual connotations. And secondly, nowhere in his writings does Le Clément hint at the possibility of mingling sperm with female bodily fl uids (be it menstrual blood or vaginal secretions). Semen seems to be for him the only substance that really counts, the one that offers the key to understanding all religious traditions and emancipating humanity. Yet the kind of sexual magic developed by Crowley in the context of the O.T.O. out of Reuss’ original system was based on the idea of the ingestion of a mixture composed of both male and female bodily fl uids, 68 See Reuss, “Fundstätten der Bausteine zum O.T.O.-Tempel,” in Parsifal und das Enthüllte Grals-Geheimnis, 44–46, reproduced in Möller & Howe, Merlin Peregrinus, 279–285 (ref. to Le Clément on 281). Reuss also makes a passing reference to Le Clé-ment and L’Eucharistie in the text of his book. See Reuss, “Parsifal und das Enthüllte Grals-Geheimnis,” 62.69 See Möller & Howe, Merlin Peregrinus, 179.70 Ibid., 180.71 See Pasi, “Ordo Templi Orients,” 900."},{"pageNumber":418,"pageContent":" the knight of spermatophagy 395which then had to be “energized” by means of mental concentration and other psycho-physical techniques. This again was signifi cantly dif-ferent from the kind of sexual magic that had been taught by Paschal Beverly Randolph and, in his wake, by the Hermetic Brotherhood of Luxor.72 Yet the latter were the immediate predecessors of the O.T.O. (both mythically and, perhaps, historically) in the development of the Anglo-American tradition of sexual magic. In fact, it would appear that neither Randolph nor the H.B. of L. gave particular importance to the use of sexual fl uids in the practice of sexual magic, and there seems to be even less evidence that they ever imparted teachings involving the ingestion of them. The ingestion of sexual fl uids in the context of modern sexual magic therefore seems to have been an innovation introduced by the O.T.O.,73 and it could very well have been this very idea that Reuss took from Le Clément’s pamphlet. In this context, it is relevant that anything which has transpired about a sexual element in Reuss’ masonic activities, even before the O.T.O. came into existence, seems to have been of a homosexual kind.74Could it be, then, that the “secret” of sexual magic transmitted by Reuss to Crowley was of a homosexual nature as well? Since we know so little about Reuss’ practices and teachings within the O.T.O. before 72 On Randolph and his techniques of sexual magic, see the already quoted Deveney, Paschal Beverley Randolph, and Deveney’s chapter in this volume. On the H.B. of L. and their techniques, see Godwin, Chanel & Deveney, The Hermetic Brotherhood of Luxor.73 Introvigne has argued that there already existed a magical tradition involving the ingestion of sperm in western esotericism, pointing at documents originating in the eighteenth-century Golden and Rosy Cross, a German masonic group, and transmitted through Cagliostro’s secret instructions for his Egyptian masonic rite. Subsequently, this tradition is supposed to have followed three different lines of transmission in France, Italy, and English-speaking countries. Introvigne has presented this thesis especially in his articles “Arcana Arcanorum” and “Presenza di Cagliostro,” and see also his Il ritorno dello gnosticismo, 149–155. However, the various trajectories by means of which this transmission supposedly took place are far from being all historically demonstrated and seem to be based mostly on (sometimes purely external) analogies. Moreover, Introvigne’s conclusion that the ingestion of sperm was also part of this particular tradition is based on a speculative reading of the documents (particularly of Cagliostro’s instructions) that is not supported by internal or external evidence. It seems clear that in the twentieth century, some esotericists, particularly in Italy, have interpreted Cagliostro’s documents in a way that is compatible with certain techniques of “inner alchemy” or sexual magic, but this does not necessarily imply that Cagliostro himself (or his immediate successors) would have sanctioned this interpretation of his teachings. At this stage of research, I fail to see any clear evidence of magical techniques involving the ingestion of sexual fl uids in the context of western esotericism before Le Clément.74 See Pasi, “Ordo Templi Orientis,” 900."},{"pageNumber":419,"pageContent":"396 marco pasiCrowley’s involvement, this must remain no more than a hypothesis for the time being, but one that deserves serious consideration. From this point of view, it becomes particularly signifi cant that the very fi rst experiments involving sexual magic made by Crowley after hav-ing received the “secret” from Reuss were homosexual.75 It has been assumed that this was a personal, heterodox interpretation of Reuss’ teachings, to be explained in terms of Crowley’s bisexuality.76 Scholars considered it obvious that Reuss’ system of sexual magic should be heterosexual. But what if it had important homosexual connotations from the very beginning?This is certainly an interesting hypothesis which, for lack of fi rst-hand evidence, will probably never be proved (or disproved, for that matter). But whether true or not, there are good reasons to assume that the infl u-ence of Le Clément’s ideas on Reuss and on the development of modern sexual magic were very signifi cant, and that he may ultimately have been responsible for introducing, at least in an Anglo-Saxon context, the very idea of the ingestion of bodily fl uids. Whether Reuss’ secret was of a homosexual or heterosexual nature has no direct bearing on the question of Le Clément’s infl uence on him, although, if this secret were homosexual, it would make such an infl uence even more evident. On the other hand, it is perhaps ironic that Le Clément’s universal revelation about the Eucharist was interpreted in terms of a magical “secret” by occultists such as Reuss and, possibly, Crowley. If we base ourselves upon Le Clément’s rhetoric alone, we should conclude that for him, spermatophagy should be anything but secret and would not have anything to do with magic either.Finally, a few words should be said about the possible infl uence of Le Clément on Aleister Crowley himself. Peter-R. König has argued that this infl uence is clearly visible in a chapter of Magick in Theory and 75 This refers to the so-called “Paris Working,” in which Crowley’s disciple Victor Neuburg participated. This was the fi rst systematic series of experiments of sexual magic made by Crowley after Reuss had revealed to him the secret of the O.T.O. The “Working” was carried out between December 1913 and February 1914. For Crowley’s own account of it, see Crowley, The Vision and the Voice, 343–409. On the other hand, there is a record of an earlier experiment from 1912 (preserved in the fi rst draft manuscript notebook of Liber Agape), which seem to refer either to autoerotic or heterosexual sex magic. In the same text, Crowley claims to have cured himself of a serious illness by its use. The diary is still unpublished, and I thank William Breeze for letting me know of the existence of this entry.76 See Symonds, The King of the Shadow Realm, 166."},{"pageNumber":420,"pageContent":" the knight of spermatophagy 397Practice (1929), Crowley’s summa of magical teachings.77 The chapter is in fact titled “Of the Eucharist; and the Art of Alchemy” and contains hints to practices of inner alchemy certainly related to the ingestion of sexual fl uids.78 However, not only does Crowley not mention Le Clément explicitly, but he does not even give any particular prominence to the notion of spermatophagy. Clearly, Crowley does not refer to the inges-tion of semen alone, but of a mixture of several bodily fl uids, which is a signifi cant departure from Le Clément’s basic idea. On the other hand, it is true that in the 1930s, Crowley tried to develop a business for the sale of pills whose miraculous medical effect was supposed to be guaranteed by the presence of his own semen.79 But again, there is no reference here to Le Clément or his ideas, and the context seems to be distant from Le Clément’s discourse anyway. In the end, it is of course more than plausible that Crowley was acquainted with Le Clément’s name or works, but it should also be noted that, to my knowledge, both the name of the Belgian spiritualist and the titles of his works are never mentioned in any of Crowley’s published or unpublished writings. If there was an infl uence of Le Clément on Crowley, it is likely that it was indirect, through Reuss.80ConclusionNot only is sexual magic a subject whose full history remains to be written, the same is true for the role of sexuality in occultism and spiritualism, and even Freemasonry. In the case of Le Clément de Saint-Marcq, we are dealing with a person who was centrally involved in these various contexts and who considered the essential “secret” as sexual in nature. As such, he is an excellent focus for research into the 77 See König, “Correct Gnosticism.” See also his “Birth and Development,” 53–55.78 See Crowley, Magick, 267–269.79 Martin Starr has published the writings and documents related to this enterprise of Crowley: see Crowley, Amrita.80 Another possibility might be the Belgian painter Leon Engers Kennedy (ca. 1890–ca. 1970), who was born in Antwerp and became involved as a young man in Reuss’ Ancient and Primitive Rite in London, and thereafter in the O.T.O. He may have been involved in the Belgian spiritualist or esoteric scene in his youth, or other-wise have encountered Le Clément. I thank William Breeze for drawing my attention to this.

Above all, Western authors have been particularly obsessed with the use of sexual rituals in Tantric practice—a phe-nomenon that was a source of disgusted revulsion for most Christian missionaries and Orientalist scholars, even as it was a source of erotic allure for many European esoteric groups. By the end of the nine-teenth century, in fact, Tantra had begun to be appropriated by vari-ous European authors and increasingly fused with Western methods of sexual magic."},{"pageNumber":425,"pageContent":"402 hugh urbanToday, if we browse the shelves of Barnes and Noble or surf the various occultist websites now saturating cyber-space, we fi nd that sexual magic is very commonly associated, and often wholly identifi ed, with Tantra. One need only run a Google-search on “sex magic” to come up with several hundred web-sites such as “SACRED SEX: Karezza, Tantra, and Sex Magic,” “TantraMagic.com,” and “Developmental Techniques for Tantra/Sex Magic,” most of which are based on a fundamental equation of Western sexual magic with Asian Tantra. In fact, the more erotically-challenged among us may now consult the Complete Idiot’s Guide to Tantric Sex, a fully-illustrated step-by-step manual for Tantric sex magic and its manifold benefi ts.1 The more adventurous among us, however, might browse the much darker work by Nikolas and Zeena Schreck, Demons of the Flesh. Presented as a neo-Tantric left-hand path adapted to the needs of the twenty-fi rst century West, Demons of the Flesh begins from the principle that “SEX IS POWER,” and prom-ises to unveil the secrets of “Sadomasochism, Orgies, Taboo-breaking, Fetishism, Orgasm prolongation, Sexual vampirism, Ritual intercourse with divine and demonic entities, Awakening the Feminine Daemonic,” as well as “Erotic deprogamming and deconditioning.”2But what, if anything, do the Asian traditions of Tantra have to do with sexual magic as it is understood in the modern West? Not much really, but quite a lot accidentally. By this I mean that the early forms of Tantra that emerged in the Hindu and Buddhist traditions of India, China, Tibet, and Japan have little in common with the forms of sexual magic that emerged in Europe and American since the nineteenth century. And yet, since the late nineteenth century, the newly-imported forms of Tantra would be progressively melded and often hopelessly confused with Western forms of sexual magic.3As most modern scholars agree, the term “Tantra” or “Tantrism” does not refer to a singular, monolithic, or neatly-defi ned entity; instead, it is a rather messy and ambiguous term used to refer to a huge array of texts, traditions, sects, and ritual practices that spread throughout the Hindu, Buddhist, and Jain communities of South and East Asia 1 “Sex magic is an advanced art of Tantric lovemaking . . . [ T ]he phrase technically refers to creating what you want through Tantric union” (Kuriansky, The Compete Idiot’s Guide, 196).2 Schreck and Schreck, Demons of the Flesh.

As André Padoux argues, the abstract category of “Tantrism”—as a singular, unifi ed “ism”—is itself a relatively recent invention and in large part the creation of western Orientalist scholars writings in the nineteenth century.4 And surely the identifi cation of Tantrism with “sexual magic” is a very recent idea. There is indeed a long tradition of sexual practice throughout the Indian Tantric schools since at least the fi fth or sixth century; and yet these Indian sexual rites bear little if any resemblance to the various forms of “spiritual sex” and “sexual magic” now being marketed in New Age bookstores or on the infi nite array of cyber-sexual web sites now proliferating on the Internet.5So how then did the complex body of traditions known as Tantra come to be mingled, combined, and fused with Western sexual magic? And how did it come to be identifi ed primarily with sensual gratifi ca-tion and sexual liberation? To answer this question, I think we need to look at the earliest Western scholarship on Tantra from the nineteenth century and then examine the complex process through which Tantra was appropriated by a Western popular audience at the turn of the twentieth century.As Richard King has argued in Orientalism and Religion, Western schol-ars of the nineteenth century consistently imagined India as a land of transcendental mysticism and other-worldly spirituality, set in contrast to the “this-worldly” and politically-active West. Rather strangely, however, King makes absolutely no reference either to the role of sexuality in mysticism or to the category of Tantra. But in fact, I will argue, Tantra was a crucial element in the Orientalist imagining of India and a key part of the modern imagining of mysticism, particularly in its darkest, most dangerous and aberrant forms.64 See Padoux, “Tantrism”; Urban, “The Extreme Orient.”5 See White, Kiss of the Yogini.6 King, Orientalism and Religion, chapter 5. King lucidly examines the “romantic and exotic fantasies of Indian religions as deeply mystical, introspective and otherworldly in nature” (p. 142); yet he strangely never mentions Tantra or anything relating to sexuality. I can only conclude that this is because the presence of Tantra would undermine his central thesis—namely, that Indian mysticism was imagined as something other-worldly, transcendent and identifi ed with Vedanta and other highly philosophical schools. The intense sensuality of Tantra in the Orientalist imagination would seem to contradict this thesis. However, I would suggest that Tantra came to represent, for both Indian and European authors, mysticism in its most degenerate form—a kind of mysticism that had been corrupted with sensual desire and this worldly-power. See Urban, Tantra and “The Extreme Orient.”"},{"pageNumber":427,"pageContent":"404 hugh urbanAs Michel Foucault has observed, this period of the late nineteenth and early twentieth century—roughly the period of the Victorian era in England—was by no means simply the age of sexual repression and prudery that we now commonly imagine it to have been. On the contrary, the late nineteenth century witnessed an unprecedented explosion of discourse about sexuality, which was now categorized, classifi ed, and described in endless titillating detail. Above all, there was a special interest in sexuality in its “deviant” or “transgressive” forms, such as homosexuality, masturbation, and other non-reproductive acts.7 The new interest in Tantra and other exotic sexual techniques from the “mystical Orient” was part of this larger Western interest in the power of sexuality in its transgressive forms. Many European men and women of the late nineteenth century, it would seem, were working through their own deep ambivalence surrounding sexuality and religion; and they found in Tantra a wonderfully “other” form of spirituality—a kind of empty mirror onto which they could project their own most intense anxieties, fears, hopes, and forbidden desires.8 For many Orientalist scholars and Christian missionaries, Tantra was reviled as the most perverse and depraved confusion of sexuality and religion, sensual indulgence, and spiritual ideals. Yet for many other authors of the late- and post-Victorian era, Tantra seemed to represent an exhilarating freedom from the oppressive prudery of nineteenth-century Christian society.In this chapter, I will examine Tantra’s complex journey to the West in the nineteenth century through one of the most important and today little-known esoteric groups of this era, the Ordo Templi Orientis. Founded by Theodor Reuss in the early twentieth century, the O.T.O. was not only one of the earliest European groups to take a serious interest in Tantra; more importantly, it was also one of the fi rst to meld the Indian traditions of yoga and Tantra with Western methods of sexual magic, such as the techniques taught by Paschal Beverly Randolph. We will see, however, that the O.T.O. would take 7 Foucault, The History of Sexuality. See also Mason, The Making of Victorian Sexuality; Anderson, When Passion Reigned.8 As Benavides comments in his study of Giuseppe Tucci, one of the great scholars of Buddhist Tantra, “The vision of the Orient nurtured by these intellectuals was in most cases a screen upon which they could project their own understanding of the Occident: either the triumphant discovery that the West was superior to the East, or the melancholy realization that the East possessed a magic no longer present in West” (“Giuseppe Tucci,” 162)."},{"pageNumber":428,"pageContent":" the yoga of sex 405these sexual techniques in a very different direction than any Indian Tantrika would have imagined. For Reuss and the O.T.O., the sexual rites of Tantra were imagined as the means to achieve not just liberating spiritual experience, but the birth of a whole new social order. Finally, for the O.T.O.’s most infamous member, Aleister Crowley, these sexual techniques were imagined as the means to destroy the old, dying world of the Christian West and usher in a new era of human history. In either case, these Western appropriations of Tantra are not so much the product of any actual Indian tradition as they are refl ections of the Orientalist fantasies and sexual obsessions of modern Western society itself.Sexual Union and Ritual Impurity in Hindu Shakta TantraThe one who is hesitant in drinking [wine] or is disgusted by semen and menstrual blood is mistaken about what is [in fact] pure and undefi led; thus he fears committing a sin in the act of sexual union. He should be dismissed—for how can he worship the Goddess, and how can he recite Chandi’s mantra?Krishnananda Agamavagisha, Brihat-Tantrasara(sixteenth century)The Goddess is fond of the vulva and penis, fond of the nectar of vulva and penis. Therefore one should fully worship the Goddess with the drinking of the virile fl uid and by taking pleasure in the wife of another man, as well as with the nectar of the vulva and penis.Kaulavalinirnaya (sixteenth century)So just what is Tantra, anyway? The word itself is derived from the Sanskrit root tan, “to weave, stretch or spread,” and has been used throughout Indian history with a wide range of meanings. It appears from the earliest Sanskrit texts, the Vedas, to denote everything from a loom or weaving machine, to a system of philosophy, to an army, row or series, to a drug or remedy.9 Most commonly tantra is used to refer to a particular text—though one that may not necessarily contain the sorts of titillating things we normally associate with “Tantra” (nor are all “Tantric” texts called tantras).9 See Urban, Tantra, 23–43; Padoux, “Tantrism.”"},{"pageNumber":429,"pageContent":"406 hugh urbanAccording to most popular literature on Tantra in the United States today, Tantra is defi ned primarily as spiritual sex or the use of sexual techniques to achieve higher consciousness and/or optimal orgasms (“nookie nirvana,” as Cosmopolitan magazine recently defi ned it).10 According to neo-Tantric guru, Margo Anand, Tantra allows one to achieve “the feeling of lightness and joy that arises during ecstatic lovemaking, a sense of ‘dancing in the sky,’ that comes when we bring the quality of meditative awareness to our orgasmic power.”11 At the same time, Tantra in the West is also often identifi ed not just with sex, but more specifi cally with sexual liberation—above all, liberation from the prudery and repression of Christian society. As the Schrecks put it in Demons of the Flesh, the Tantric adept is “the gleeful transgressor of all accepted boundaries,” who joyfully overthrows the “distorted psychosexual conditions that the past centuries of Christian dominance have engendered.”12And yet in most Asian traditions Tantra is generally understood less in term of “sex” than in terms of power or energy. That is, it is a series of teachings and techniques aimed at awakening, harnessing, and utilizing the spiritual power believed to fl ow through the entire cosmos and the human body. Thus, as White defi nes it, Tantra isthat Asian body of beliefs and practices which, working from the principle that the universe we experience is nothing other than the concrete mani-festation of the divine energy of the godhead that creates and maintains that universe, seeks to ritually appropriate and channel that energy, within the human microcosm, in creative and emancipatory ways.13In the Hindu Tantric traditions, this energy is typically identifi ed as shakti—the power that creates, sustains, and destroys the universe—but it is also the power that fl ows through the social and political world, as well. Tantric ritual seeks to harness and exploit this power, both as a means to spiritual liberation and as a means to this-worldly benefi ts, such as wealth, fame, and supernatural abilities. As Douglas Brooks summarizes, “The Tantrika conceives of the world as power. The 10 Collins, “The Secret to Tantric Sex,” 240. “The result is both an out of body bond with your partner plus very physical ecstatic orgasms . . .

And when it is used, it is typically restricted to closely guarded esoteric rituals and surrounded by severe warnings about the dangers of its abuse. In the words of one of the most famous and infl uential medieval texts, the Kularnava Tantra,What I tell you must be kept with great secrecy. This must not be given to just anyone. It must only be given to a devoted disciple. It will be death to any others.If liberation could be attained simply by having intercourse with a [female partner], all living beings in the world would be liberated just by having intercourse with women.15Many forms of Tantric practice do involve explicit forms of ritual transgression. Consumption of meat and wine, and in some cases sexual intercourse in violation of class laws, can be employed as a means of awakening and harnessing the awesome power or shakti that fl ows through all things. Yet at the same time, Tantra is really by no means the subversive, anti-social force that many Western readers imagine it to be. On the contrary, it is in most cases a highly conservative tradition, which ultimately re-asserts the ritual authority and social status of male brahmins. Social and sexual taboos are typically only violated in highly controlled ritual contexts and are generally re-asserted—indeed, reinforced—outside the boundaries of esoteric ritual: “Anti-caste state-ments should never be read outside their ritual context. Returned to ordinary life, no high caste Tantric would think of breaking social taboos . . . The ritual egalitarianism of Tantrism in practice acted as a caste-confi rming . . . force.”16Not only is there a vast diversity of different texts, sects, rituals, and traditions that fall under the general category of “Tantra,” but there is also a huge diversity of opinion about the role of sexual union in Tantric practice. Various Tantric schools—and various modern scholars of Tan-tra—differ widely over the most basic questions: for example, is sexual union meant to be understood literally and performed physically, or is 14 Brooks, Auspicious Wisdom, xix.

Should orgasm occur, or should orgasm be avoided? Should the semen be emitted duringunion, or should it be withheld and sublimated inwardly? Does the female partner have an active role in the union, or is she a mere tool or “fl ower” from which the “nectar” is collected and then cast aside? Some schools call for a diffi cult act of seminal retention and sublimation during the rite; others use an even more complex procedure called the vajroli mudra, which involves not only seminal retention but actually the sucking or withdrawal of the female sexual fl uids out of the woman’s body into the male body (what some call the “fountain pen technique”); and others reject the physical act of union altogether in favor of a purely symbolic understanding of divine union.17As David Gordon White argues, one of the oldest Tantric schools, the Kaula (from kula, lineage or family), centered around the oral consumption of sexual fl uids. By consuming the combined semen and vaginal fl uids, the initiate was literally “incorporated” into the esoteric lineage, physically infused with its most powerful essence: “the Tantric Virile Hero generated and partook of his own and his consort’s vital fl uids in a ‘eucharistic’ ritual, whose ultimate consumer was the God-dess herself, who pleased, would afford the supernatural enjoyments and powers the practitioner sought.”18In India generally, bodily fl uids, and above all sexual fl uids, are con-sidered dangerous and potentially polluting, as the ambivalent leftovers that overfl ow the boundaries of the physical body.19 In the Tantric rite, however, the sexual fl uids are the ultimate source of power. According to the sixteenth century Birhat Tantrasara (“the Great Essence of the Tantras”), the combined sexual fl uids become the kula dravya or “clan substance,” which is the most awesome and dangerous of substances. It is the powerful “remnant” (ucchishta) of the “sexual sacrifi ce:”With the sacrifi cial elements, the semen, unbroken grains of rice, perfume, fl owers, he should worship the Goddess in the vagina . . . With incense, lamps and various food offerings, the Kula adept should honor her in various ways, and then he should [consume] the remnants himself.2017 See Brooks, The Secret of the Three Cities, 51–52.18 White, Kiss of the Yogini, 73–74.19 “Indian traditions have always viewed sexual fl uids, and most particularly the uterine or menstrual blood, as polluting, powerful, and therefore dangerous substances” (White, Kiss of the Yogini, 67).

If consumed outside the secret ritual, it will send one to the most terrible of hells: “apart from the time of worship, one must never touch a naked shakti. And apart from the period of worship, the nectar must never be drunk by adepts. Touching it, their lives are lost, and drinking it, they would go to hell. Thus is the Kula worship.”21 But once placed in a sacrifi cial vessel and consecrated by the Goddess, the kula dravya is transformed into divine nectar, amrita. By consuming this nectar, the Tantrika will enjoy supreme bliss and fulfi llment of all worldly and otherworldly desires.Then with great effort, he must obtain the precious Kula nectar. For with that divine nectar, all [the gods] are pleased. Whatever the wise man desires, he will immediately attain . . . Having purifi ed the Kula substance, which has the nature of Shiva and Shakti, O Beloved, and having deposited this nectar of life, which is of the nature of the Supreme Brahman, in a sacrifi cial vessel, [he attains] the eternally blameless state free of all distinctions.22Clearly, the Tantric rite of maithuna and the consumption of the com-bined sexual fl uids is a profoundly transgressive act—an act that must be surrounded with an intense secrecy, and one that would destroy those who undertake it without proper intention or ritual controls. And surely much of its power derives precisely from its transgressive char-acter. Like the sexual fl uids themselves, these rites are surrounded with an aura of impurity and danger; but the Tantrik hero (vira) who dares to engage in them can transcend the mundane boundaries that limit ordinary human beings. As Alexis Sanderson observes, the aim of this transgression is precisely to attain a kind of “unfettered super-agency through the assimilation of their lawless power in occult manipulations of impurity.”23That being said, however, the sort of “transgression” described in Tantric texts like the Kaulajnananirnaya or the Brihat Tantrasara is hardly a matter of socio-political transgression or a subversion of the larger status quo. In most cases it is quite the reverse. As Douglas Brooks argues, the highly esoteric transgressions of Tantric ritual typically served not to undermine the class system or brahman authority, but on the contrary21 Brihat Tantrasara, 704.22 Ibid., 703.23 Sanderson, “Purity and Power,” 200–201.

That is to say, they re-affi rmed the authority of male brahmans as ritual experts who were skillful enough to handle the dangerous power unleashed by ritual impurity: “Tantrism . . . does not intend to be revolutionary in the sense of establishing a new structure of social egalitarianism . . . It opens its doors only to a few who . . . seek to distinguish and empower themselves.”24 As we see in the case of the most famous Tantrikas like Abhinavagupta, Bhaskararaya or Krishnananda Agamavagisha, most Tantric authors insist that such transgressions were to be carefully restricted to closed ritual contexts; outside of esoteric ritual, the class system and brahman authority were to be reaffi rmed, perhaps more strongly than ever.Tantra in the Orientalist ImaginationShaktas usually meet in a forest glade where, by the light of a huge bonfi re, they begin the ceremony by getting drunk and eating cow’s fl esh.

This shift begins, I think, during the early colonial era, with the fi rst discussion of Indian religions by Christian missionaries and Orientalist scholars in the nineteenth cen-tury. The Orientalist interest in the Tantras, I would argue, was a part of the broader concern with sexuality and its aberrations during the Victorian era. As Foucault points out and we have already noted, the nineteenth century was anything but a period of silence and suppres-sion of sex, but rather an era of unprecedented new discourse about sexuality, which was now endlessly described, classifi ed and analyzed as “the secret.”25 Above all, there was a new fascination with sexuality in its socially deviant or perverse forms, which were now categorized in intricate detail. As Richard von Krafft-Ebing suggested in his widely infl uential text, Psychopathia Sexualis, the sexual instinct is the most power-ful, sublime and potentially dangerous force in human nature, the origin of our religion and ethics as well as our most bizarre perversions:[S]exual feeling is the basis upon which social advancement is developed. If man were deprived of sexual distinction and the nobler enjoyments arising therefrom, all poetry and . . . moral tendency would be eliminated from his life. . . . Sexual feeling is the root of all ethics, and no doubt of aestheticism and religion. The sublimest virtues . . . spring from sexual life, which, however, on account of its sensual power, may easily degenerate into the lowest passion and basest vice. Love unbridled is a volcano that burns down and lays waste to all around it; it is an abyss that devours all—honor, substance and health.26Thus Krafft-Ebing and other European sexual scientists compiled a vast catalogue of sexual deviations—a sort of “medicoforensic peep-show” of perversions27—ranging from homosexuality and sadism to 25 “The society that emerged in the nineteenth century—the bourgeois capitalist or industrial society . . .—did not confront sex with a fundamental refusal of recogni-tion. On the contrary, it put into operation an entire machinery for producing true discourses concerning it. Not only did it speak of sex and compel everyone to do so; it also set out to formulate the uniform truth of sex. As if it suspected sex of harboring a fundamental secret” (Foucault, The History of Sexuality, 69).26 Krafft-Ebing, Psychopathia Sexualis, 24.27 Kern, The Culture of Love, 334–335.

Among the most “dangerous” aberrations were those that mingled religion and sexuality: “The cause of religious insanity is often to be found in sexual aberration. In psychosis a motley mixture of religious and sexual delusions is observable. . . . The cruel, sensual acts of chas-tisement, violation, emasculation and even crucifi xion, perpetrated by religious maniacs, bear our this assertion.”28 Thus it is not surprising that many European authors were particularly fascinated, repulsed, and tantalized by the secret rites of the Tantrikas, with their explicit fusion of spiritual power and sensual pleasure.The early Orientalist authors, such as Sir William Jones and H.T. Colebrooke, actually had relatively little to say about Tantra. It was really not until the beginning of the nineteenth century, with the arrival of Christian missionaries like Rev. William Ward, that Tantra became objects of intense interest and morbid fascination. Above all, the missionaries singled out the sexual element—particularly transgres-sive sexuality—as the most horrifi c aspect of Tantra and the clearest evidence of its complete depravity. As Ward put it, “the tuntras” involve “a most shocking mode of worship” centered around the worship of a naked woman and rites “too abominable to enter the ears of man and impossible to be revealed to a Christian public.”29For later authors like H.H. Wilson and Sir Monier-Williams, Tantra was incorporated into the larger Orientalist narrative of Indo-European history and the decadence of modern India. According to most Orien-talist accounts, the history of India was a steady decline from a golden age, comparable to ancient Greece and embodied in the texts of the Vedas, down to a modern era of licentious superstition, embodied in the perverse rites of the Tantras. Throughout nineteenth-century literature, we fi nd Tantra described in the most vivid language as “lust mummery and black magic,” (Brian Hodgson) “nonsensical extravagance and absurd gesticulation,” (H.H. Wilson) and “black art of the crudest and fi lthiest kind” in which “a veritable devil’s mass is purveyed in various forms.” (D.L. Barnett)30 By the early twentieth century, as we see in the setting apart of the ‘unnatural’ as a specifi c dimension in the fi eld of sexuality” (The History of Sexuality, 38–39).28 Krafft-Ebing, Psychopathia Sexualis, 29.29 Ward, A View of the History, v.I, 247.

One of the most widely-read (though least original) authors on Tantra was Edward Sellon, who was best known as an author of cheap pornography, such as The New Epicurean or the Delights of Sex Facetiously and Philosophically Considered in Graphic Letters Addressed to Young Ladies of Quality. Having served as an Ensign in the Madras infantry as a young man, Sellon was particu-larly fascinated with the erotic mysteries of the Orient with all its dark skinned “houris.” As he described his exploits among the enchanting women of India,I now commenced a regular course of fucking with native women. The usual charge for the general run of them is two rupees. For fi ve, you may get the handsomest Mohammedan girls, and any of the high caste women who follow the trade of a courtesan.

Like his description of these dark-skinned, hyper-eroticized Indian women, his view of Hinduism only continues the worst Orien-talist stereotypes of the dark, mysterious, libidinous East. Above all, his titillating description of Tantric worship—in which “natural restraints are wholly disregarded” and which “terminates with orgies amongst the 31 Demaitre, The Yogis of India, 222–23.

Although the Kama Sutra in fact had little if anything to do with Tantra, from Burton’s time on, it would become largely confused and often completely identifi ed with Tantra in the Western popular imagination.In the fi rst decades of the twentieth century, a few brave scholars made an effort to defend and re-valorize Tantra, arguing that there is far more to this ancient tradition than mere illicit sexuality. The most important fi gure in this moralizing reform of Tantra was John Woodroffe (a.k.a. Arthur Avalon), the enigmatic High Court Judge and secret Tantrika, who made it is his life’s work to defend the Tantras against their many critics.35 In Woodroffe’s rather sanitized, rationalized account, Tantra is a noble philosophical tradition, basically in line with the Vedas and Vedanta and comparable in its symbolism to the liturgy of the Catholic Church.36Despite Woodroffe’s attempts to present a sanitized and reformed version of Tantra, however, the equation of Tantra with sex would persist throughout the Western imagination, both popular and scholarly. By the mid-twentieth century, Tantra had become more or less equated with its sexual component, most commonly defi ned as “spiritual sex,” and generally confused with Indian erotica like the Kama Sutra. For the most part, this is a misunderstanding and confusion that continues to this day.33 Sellon, Annotations on the Sacred writings of the Hindüs.34 See Burton, trans., Kama Sutra of Vatsyayana.35 On Woodroffe, see Urban, Ta n t r a, 134–64, and Taylor, Sir John Woodroffe, Tantra and Bengal. Taylor argues that “Arthur Avalon” is not simply a pseudonym for Woodroffe, but is rather the joint creation of Woodroffe and a Bengali, Atal Behari Ghose, who helped him translate most of the texts.36 “Tantra simply presents the Vedantik teachings in a symbolic form for the worshipper, to whom it prescribes the means whereby they may be realized in fact” (Woodroffe, Shakti and Shakta, 587)."},{"pageNumber":438,"pageContent":" the yoga of sex 415Paschal Beverly Randolph and the Beginnings of Sex MagicThe Light of the East, despite all fog, has emerged victorious!Orifl amme (1912)A new civilization, a new system of morals will arise from the new Christianity of the gnostic Templar-Christians. . . .

Although they are little known or studied in contemporary scholarship, the O.T.O. was to play a critical role in the development of sexual magic and Tantra in the West over the last 100 years, for it is in the O.T.O. that we fi nd the fi rst real attempt to unite the two currents of Western sexual magic and the new, often garbled and mis-understood traditions of Tantra coming from India. The O.T.O. thus represents one of the fi rst, even if rather misdirected and confused, attempts at cross-cultural synthesis between Eastern and Western eso-teric traditions.Sex, magic, and secrecy had, of course, long been associated in the Western religious imagination: from the early Gnostics to the Knights Templar to the Cathars of late medieval Europe, esoteric orders had long been accused of using sexual rituals as part of their secret magi-cal arts.37 However, perhaps the fi rst evidence of a sophisticated and well-documented use of sexual magical techniques cannot be found any earlier than the mid-nineteenth century, with the mysterious fi gure of Paschal Beverly Randolph (1825–75) (the focus of Patrick Deveney’s essay in this same volume).38 A mulatto born of a wealthy Virginian father and a slave form Madagascar, Randolph was raised a poor, self-taught free black in New York city.

In sexual love, “he saw the greatest hope for the regeneration of the world, the key to personal fulfi llment as well as social transformation and the basis of a non-repressive civilization.”39In the course of his wanderings through Europe, the Middle East, and Asia, Randolph encountered a wide variety of esoteric traditions—not just European Spiritualist, Masonic, and Roscicrucian orders, but also a range of Sufi lineages. In fact, he claims to have derived much of his knowledge from a group of Fakirs in the areas of Jerusalem and Bethlehem, which may have been a branch of the unorthodox Muslim mystical order of the Nusaxiri—a group long persecuted by orthodox Islam because of their alleged Gnostic sexual rituals.40Whatever his primary inspiration, Randolph began to teach a form of sexual magic that would have a profound impact on much of later Western esotericism. For Randolph, the experience of orgasm is in fact the critical moment in human consciousness and the key to magical power. During orgasm, as new life is infused from the spiritual realm into the material, the soul is suddenly opened up to the spiritual ener-gies of the cosmos: “at the instant of intense mutual orgasm the souls of the partners are opened to the powers of the cosmos and anything then truly willed is accomplished.”41 As such, the experience of sexual climax has the potential to lead the soul either upward or downward, to higher states of spiritual transcendence or to lower, more depraved states of corruption:The moment when a man discharges his seed—his essential self—into a . . . womb is the most solemn, energetic and powerful moment he can ever know on earth; if under the infl uence of mere lust it be done, the discharge is suicidal. . . .

If one can harness the creative energy aroused by sexual contact, he can realize virtually any worldly or other-worldly goal. Not only can one achieve the spiritual aims of divine insight, but he can also attain the mundane goals of physical health, fi nancial success, or regaining the passions of a straying lover. Accord-ing to Randolph, the major uses sex magic are:I. For purposes of increasing the brain and body power of an unborn child, II. Infl uencing one’s wife or husband and magnetically controlling them, III. regaining youthful beauty, energy, vivacity, affectional and magnetic power, IV. prolonging the life of either the subject or actor or either at will, V. attainment of Supreme white magic of will, affection or Love, VI. For the furtherance of fi nancial interests, schemes, lotteries, etc. VII. The attainment of the loftiest insight possible to the earthly soul.43One of the most striking features of Randolph’s sexual magic, however, is his insistence that both male and female partners must have an active role in the process, and in fact, that both must achieve orgasm in order for the magical operation to successful: “For the prayer to be effective the paroxysm of both is necessary . . . [ T ]he woman’s orgasms should coincide with man’s emission, for only in this way will the magic be fulfi lled.”44 The resulting pleasure that both partners feel in this union is nothing less than the overfl owing joy of the divine emanating from above like the breath of God himself:When pleasure results from the meeting of the electric currents of the male with the magnetic fl ow of the female, in the nerves of each, as in the touch of loving lips, the two currents spread out into waves, which fl ow all over the nervous network of both until they die out . . . upon the foot 42 Randolph, The Mysteries of Eulis (manuscript 1860) reproduced in Deveney, Paschal Beverly Randolph, 339–40.

A wealthy Austrian paper chemist, Kellner had studied widely in various esoteric traditions such as Freemasonry and Rosicrucianism and also traveled to Asia to delve into the Eastern mysteries. In the course of his travels, Kellner claims, he studied with three Eastern masters whom he identifi ed as a Sufi named Soliman ben Aifa and two Hindu Tantrikas named Bhima Sena Pratapa and Sri Mahatma Agamya Paramahamsa. According to later O.T.O. accounts, Kellner was also in contact with an esoteric order known as the Hermetic Brotherhood of Light. First appearing in Chicago in 1895 (though some date it earlier, to 1885), the Hermetic Brotherhood of Light appears to be either an offshoot or a rival branch of the Hermetic Brotherhood of Luxor, which had adapted many of Randolph’s teachings on sexual magic.4745 Randolph, Eulis!, 126. “No real magic power can or will descend into the soul of either except in the mighty moment, the orgasmal instant of BOTH—not one alone! for then only do the mystic doors of the SOUL OPEN TO THE SPACES” (The Ansairetic Mystery, in Deveney, Paschal Beverly Randolph, 314). 46 Deveney, Paschal Beverly Randolph, 252.47 The connection of Kellner with the Hermetic Brotherhood of Light was asserted in the journal Orifl amme in 1912.

As former friend, August Weinholtz, described him in 1907 in the Masonic periodical L’Acacia,This man’s cleverness and extraordinary activities, his sophistries, his knowledge of languages, his ability to play no matter what role, make him a real international menace. In some respects he reminds one of Cagliostro, the most brilliant of all masonic charlatans, who successfully contrived to dupe his contemporaries.49After enjoying some success as a music-hall singer and newspaper cor-respondent, Reuss also appears to have been involved in some contro-versial political activities. In the 1880s, using false credentials, he joined the Socialist League, a Marxist group that attracted various dislocated communists and anarchists. Later, he would be accused by many of operating as a spy under the direction of the Prussian secret police, who had allegedly sent him to England to monitor the activities of Marx’s daughter, Eleanor Marx-Aveling. Although the charges of espionage were never proven, they did add to Reuss’ image as a mysterious fi gure who was variously regarded as either a genius or a charlatan.50It is not entirely clear what connection there may have been between Reuss’ political career and his occult activities. However, he would eventually claim to have an immense body of esoteric knowledge and identifi ed himself as a master in a wide range of occult traditions, particularly the “Irregular” forms of Masonry such as the Ancient and Accepted Primitive Rite of Memphis and Mizraim and the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite. And he would ornament himself with a variety of impressive titles, such as Illustrious Brother, Expert Master Mason, Secret Master, Perfect Master, Grand Elect Knight Kadosh, 30°, Grand Inquisitor Commander, 31°, Prince of the Royal Secret, Luxor, 422, 428. For a discussion of Kellner’s life see Dvorak, “Carl Kellner.” The best overall reconstruction of O.T.O. history is Pasi, “Ordo Templi Orientis.”48 There is some debate as to whether Kellner or Reuss was the founder of the O.T.O. Offi cial O.T.O. sources generally credit Kellner as the one who came up with the idea of the Orientalische Templer in 1895; critics like König, however, claim that Reuss was the real founder; see König, “The OTO Phenomenon,” and “Theodor Reuss as Founder of Esoteric Orders;” Howe and Möller, “Theodor Reuss.”49 L’Acacia 9 (Paris, 1907): 387–88, quoted in Howe and Möller, “Theodor Reuss.”50 Howe and Möller, “Theodor Reuss.” See also Howe and Möller, Merlin Peregrinus."},{"pageNumber":443,"pageContent":"420 hugh urbanthe Sovereign Sanctuary of the Gnosis, and various other increasingly elaborate ranks and degrees.During the 1890s, Reuss claims to have collaborated with Kellner in order to form a new esoteric order dedicated to the inner secrets of magical practice. Initially, the goal was to found a new Academia Masonica that would enable all Freemasons to become familiar with all existing degrees and systems of Masonry. This appears to have been the origi-nal inspiration for the O.T.O., as a complex fusion of Craft Masonry, Rosicrucianism, and various Eastern imports, above all the techniques of Hindu Tantra. However, as Reuss defi ned it, the “Ancient Order of Oriental Templars” is nothing less than a secret, powerful brotherhood that has been operating covertly throughout all of history, guiding the forces of culture, politics, and even revolutions:Let it be known that there exists, unknown to the great crowd, a very ancient order of sages, whose object is the amelioration and spiritual eleva-tion of mankind. . . . This Order has existed already in the most remote, prehistoric times, and it has manifested its activity secretly and openly in the world . . . it has caused social and political revolutions and proved to be the rock of salvation in times of danger and misfortune.51The time had now come for this secret order of sages to reveal itself openly to the world.From its origins, the O.T.O. claimed to be in possession of the inner-most secret of all esoteric systems, the most profound mystery that lies at the foundation of all occult, mystical, and spiritual traditions, even the secret of the Eastern Sages, and the means to rebuild the Temple of Solomon. According to a 1904 edition of Reuss’ journal, Orifl amme:One of the secrets which our Order possesses to its highest degree con-sists in the fact that it supplies the properly prepared brother with the PRACTICAL means to erect the true Temple of Solomon in Man and to fi nd again the “lost Word”: namely, that our Order supplies to the initiated and chosen brother the practical means to obtain proof of his immortality even during his earthly existence. . . .This secret is one of the true secrets of Masonry and exclusively the secret of the Occult High Degree of Our Order. It has come down to our Order by word of mouth from the fathers of all true Freemasonry, the “Wise Men of the East”5251 “Ancient Order of Oriental Templars,” in König, ed., Der Grosse Theodor Reuss Reader, 126.52 Reuss, “Von den Geheimnissen der okkulten Hochgrade unseres Ordens,” 31; reproduced in König, Der Grosse Theodor Reuss Reader, 75."},{"pageNumber":444,"pageContent":" the yoga of sex 421But what is this tremendous secret of the East that opens up the trea-sures of all occult systems of knowledge? The answer is given eight years later in the 1912 anniversary issue of the Orifl amme: the supreme mystery is nothing less that the secret of sexual magic, which, though extremely rare and precious, can be revealed to the most qualifi ed seekers:Our Order possess the KEY which opens up all Masonic and Hermetic secrets, namely, the teaching of sexual magic, and this teaching explains, without exception, all the secrets of Nature, all the symbolism of FREE-MASONRY and all systems of religion.53Now, although this teaching of sexual magic is the secret of the O.T.O. and is not suitable for publication in a pamphlet which reaches wide circles, nevertheless, the management of the Order has decided to lift a very small tip of the veil which conceals our secret . . . to enlighten earnest seekers.54Sexual magic may have already been a part of Carl Kellner’s esoteric practice, which he claimed to have learned from the masters of the Orient. Kellner was in fact one of the few Western authors at the time who had a fairly detailed knowledge of yoga and certainly one of the few who had anything more than disdain for its more esoteric prac-tices. In a piece attributed to Kellner in the 1912 issue of Orifl amme, he adapts the yogic idea of the vayus or vital energies believed to exist in specifi c parts of the physical body, such as the heart, anus, navel, larynx, eyes, etc. He was particularly interested in the vayus associated with the reproductive organ (the napa), which could be sublimated, re-directed, and transformed into intense spiritual energy through yogic practice. This, according to Kellner, is true “sexual magic” and the source of god-like power:[S]exual magic is concerned with the Vayus Napa (in the reproductive organ) . . . This exercise is called “Transmutation of the Reproductive Energy.” This exercise of the transmutation of the Reproductive energy is not done for the purpose of sexual excess, but in order to strengthen the eternal God Power on the earthly plane requiring sexually strong, perfect persons. . . . The reproductive energy is a process of creation. It is a Godly act! In the reproductive organ (male and female) there is concentrated in the smallest space the greatest vital force . . . [ T ]he per-former of the exercise must concentrate all his thoughts on withdrawing and lifting the reproductive energy from the organ into the solar plexus, 53 Reuss, Jubilaeums-Ausgabe der Orifl amme, 21.54 Reuss, “Mysteria Mystica Maxima,” Jubilaeums-Ausgabe der Orifl amme, 21."},{"pageNumber":445,"pageContent":"422 hugh urbanwhere he “wills” that it be stored for transmutation purposes . . . [ F ]inally the great “merging” or reunion occurs and the performer becomes the seer while remaining fully conscious and experiences what he sees. This is white sexual magic!55Many believe that Kellner also engaged in more esoteric forms of magic together with a small circle of disciples called the “Inner Tri-angle;” these involved various forms of Yoga, meditation, and sexual rites aimed at generating the divine “Elixir”: “His wife was the Great Goddess. Kellner himself acted as Babylonian Priest. In his house was a room without windows where the tantric rites took place to prepare the Elixir, that is: male and female sexual fl uids.”56It was really Theodor Reuss, however, who made sexual magic a central part of O.T.O. practice. Indeed, Reuss regarded sexual rituals and the cult of the Lingam (the Sanskrit word for the phallus or male sexual organ) as the root of all religion, “the most ancient cult on earth,” and the core of every spiritual tradition from pre-historic times down to the Christian Church itself. And the quintessential form of phallic worship is Tantra. As Helmut Möller and Ellic Howe observe, Reuss’ knowledge of Tantra seems to have been drawn primarily from sec-ondary European sources and was “nebulous” at best.57 Following most European Orientalists of the day, he defi nes Tantra as basically “sexual religion.” In his words, “Tantra (Sexual-religion) is built on the active principle of generation, as it manifests in the female energy (Shakti) and the manly energy (Shiva). The Linga (Phallus) is the holiest form in which and through which the great lord-God must be worshipped.”58 This Tantric sexual religion is for Reuss essentially the same as that of the Eleusinian mysteries and early Christian Gnosticism, both of which he sees as cults of fertility and sensual ecstasy:The Eleusinian mysteries were pure Phallus cult. The ceremonies were those of the Tantrics. The members of these mysteries partook of such ecstasy that the freedom of the senses came to them as a totally natural by-product . . .55 Kellner, in Jubilaeums-Ausgabe der Orifl amme, 22–23.

Phallicism is the basis of all theology and underlies the mythology of all peoples. . . . The Phallus as a divine symbol received divine veneration for thousands of years in India.59Indeed, Reuss believes that the ancient cult of the Phallus has survived in a masked form throughout the centuries of Christian rule, persist-ing throughout popular worship and even in the symbolism of the mainstream Church. As he argues in the Introduction to his treatise on sexual worship, Lingam-Yoni,In spite of the efforts of the Christian churches, over 120 million people . . .are still practitioners of the sex cult (Lingam-yoni), which surely shows the need to spread widely authentic material about phallism.

[ T ]he Catholic Church uses, in a hidden form, the phallus worship, Lingam-Yoni cult . . . taken from so-called Pagan rituals. . . . It was the leading religious cult during the fullest fl owering of the cultures of classical antiquity, and is still a living factor in our time.60The modern world, Reuss believed, was entering a new era in which the repressive attitudes of Christian Europe were being replaced by a liberated view of sexuality. Even the proliferation of pornography was a natural by-product of this new acceptance of sexuality and the body:[O]ur time is a time of transition. Old ideas, old habits, old opinions and principles of living vanish bit by bit, and new ideas, new habits . . . even new religion, seem to grow out of our modern Western cultural ferment. It is only natural that this fermentation makes for peculiar bubbles, and occasionally a lot of foul smelling gas. I need only point out the frighten-ing growth of pornographic literature. . . . But actually these are only the side-effects of a growth period of a new Weltanschauung, maybe even an entirely new world.61Under Reuss, sexual magic would become a central part of the upper grades of the O.T.O. The early Ordo was organized in ten major 59 Ibid., 72.60 Reuss, Lingam-Yoni, Introduction. This passage was also published in Orifl amme 5, no. 1 (1906): 33–4.

It is in the IX degree that the most profound mystery of mysteries was to be revealed, namely, “the highest, most glorious, holiest, Symbol of sexual-magic! Here begins a secret teaching which is exclusively for initiates.” And this secret of sexual magic is in turn identifi ed with the pre-Christian “pagan” traditions, of which Indian Tantra and the union of lingam and yoni is the clearest example.62 The Lingam is, for Reuss, the most sacred symbol of creation, divine power, and the Logos; as Peter König observes, Reuss regarded the semen as the key to magical power and viewed women as ultimately non-essential to magical practice. Indeed, Reuss would later claim that the “central secret of the O.T.O.” was in fact a sexual interpretation of the Holy Mass, which involved “the union of man with God through consump-tion of semen—as allegedly taught by Jesus Christ.”63Much of the O.T.O. literature employs complicated symbolism drawn from alchemy and Hermeticism to describe esoteric sexual rites. As Francis King explains, “the code phrase for the penis is the athanor, that for semen is the blood of the red lion, or the Serpent, while the vagina is referred to as the retort . . . [ T ]he fl uids which lubricate the female organ are the menstruum of the gluten and the mixture of these with the male discharge is the fi rst matter or, when it has been impregnated with the magic power, the Elixir.”64 Sexual rites can be used for a wide variety of magical purposes, ranging from the invocation of a god to the fi nding of hidden treasure. For example, one might use sexual magic to magically empower a talisman; by concentrating on one’s intended goal at the moment of orgasm and then anointing the talisman with the semen, one infuses it with magical power which can then be employed for a wide range of this-worldly and other-worldly ends. Similarly, the power of controlled imagination and sexuality can be used to incarnate a god within one’s consciousness, by concentrating all one’s will on the deity at the moment of orgasm and so “blending their personalities into one.”6562 Reuss, “Parsifal und das Enthüllte Grals-Geheimnis.”63 König, “The Early O.T.O. and its Development.” Reuss found this interpretation of the Mass in a text by Le Clément de Saint-Marcq: L’Eucharistie (1906); re-printed in Der Grosse Theodor Reuss Reader.

Chief among the accusations was homosexuality, which does appear to have played some role in O.T.O. sexual magic. Thus, the Masonic Journal of Vienna published an article claiming that Reuss had engaged in a shocking “homosexual assault” that involved the “mutual touching of the phalli” during esoteric rituals.66 Another journal, the antisemitic Der Judenkenner, would later allege that several novices were so horrifi ed by these rites that they reported Reuss to the police, causing him to fl ee the country: “In the summer of 1906 he went to Munich . . . in order to initiate some ‘Novizen’ in the secret of the Order of the Templars. These ‘Novizen’ were so disgusted by these ‘revelations’ that they alerted the police to arrest the libertine Reuss, who . . . fl ed to his crony John Yarker in England.”67Freedom from Original Sin: The Utopian Social Vision of the O.T.O.Freedom in & before God, that is the liberation from original sin, through which the reigning chris-tian-nazarene Church has enslaved to their priests humanity from birth. . . . Love is the crowning of the world. Love is the highest law. Love is God.Theodor Reuss, “The Gnostic Neo-Christians” (1917)Like Randolph, Reuss clearly linked his sexual magical practices to a much larger vision of social transformation. Yet he also went a great deal further than Randolph had imagined by calling for the creation of an entire new morality and civilization based on freedom from origi-nal sin and sexual guilt. The power of sexual magic was not to be a matter of secret practice among the initiated few but would eventually spread outward and lead to the radical reform of society at large: “the sexual re-education of the masses would be the responsibility of ‘priest-doctors’ . . . [ P ]rivate property would be eliminated, forced labour and eugenics were to be introduced, while only physically perfect parents 66 König, “Anal Intercourse and the O.T.O.”67 Der Judenkenner 7 (12 February 1936), reproduced in König, “Theodor Reuss as Founder of Esoteric Orders,” 188."},{"pageNumber":449,"pageContent":"426 hugh urbanwould be permitted to have children. The religion of the O.T.O. would become that of the State.”68The new civilization that Reuss imagined was to be based on the worldview of the early Christian Gnostics—or at least what Reuss imag-ined the Gnostic worldview to be, given the fairly skewed knowledge of Gnosticism in early twentieth-century Europe. This new society would be a “Neo-Gnostic” society of “Templar-Christians” who had rejected the false idea of original sin and realized the inherent divinity of the sexual act. For the sexual act is the power to create life, and it is this power that makes us god-like, capable of creating life like God Himself. Sexual union is thus a sacrament and a “communion,” no less than the sacrament of the Eucharist:A new civilization, a new system of morals will arise from the new Chris-tianity of the gnostic Templar-Christians . . . [ T ]he Church of the gnostic Neo-Christians seeks to found communities, existing on a co-operative basis, of sinless, i.e. freed from the Nazarene-Christian idea of original sin, people. For the formation of such gnostic “Christos” communities only those are suitable who are . . . convinced of the truth of Manu’s saying: “Only he who has understood the holy doctrine of sanctity of the God-Organs is truly liberated and free from all sins” . . . The gnostics recognize that humanity’s “resemblance to God” consists in the fact that they are able to grasp and understand the divinity of the earthly act of procreation as a parallel of the divine act of creation . . . [ T ]he act of love consummated under the control of the will in God is a sacramental act, a “Mystic Marriage with God,” a communion, a union of self with God.69A key part of Reuss’ vision of a new civilization free of original sin was a new respect for women. Because women can bear children, they are the ultimate embodiment of sexuality and should be revered as the highest symbol of this divine power of creation. This reverence for woman as Mother would in turn form the foundation for a new kind of nation for the future:The fi rst aim of our Order in the esoteric-practical realization of our teachings is that in the future the “Mother” is to be honored as “High priestess” in her family.Every pregnant woman is a “Saint” in our eyes. . . . She is the symbol of human procreation from the Godly power of creation . . .68 König, “The Early OTO and its Development.”69 Reuss, “The Gnostic Neo-Christians” (1917), reproduced in König, Der Gross Theodor Reuss Reader."},{"pageNumber":450,"pageContent":" the yoga of sex 427Our Order proves that it does not merely follow abstract goals, but that it is capable of intervening energetically in the everyday life of our common people whenever it is urgently necessary that they be educated to a correct understanding . . . of the duties of a nation with regard to its own future, particularly during the present era.70It would, however, be a mistake to regard Reuss as a feminist. His ideal of the true woman was largely in keeping with mainstream nineteenth-century values: woman is to be exalted as a mother and revered for her central role in the domestic sphere. In fact, Reuss was quite critical of the early form of feminism emerging in England, “with its extreme Motherhood-denying ‘woman’s movement (Suffragettes),” and he hoped that the O.T.O. could help restore the true cult of Motherhood.71One of the more intriguing episodes in Reuss’ life and utopian aspirations occurred during the last decade of his life in Switzerland. In August of 1917, Reuss organized an international “Anti-National” Congress under O.T.O. auspices at Monte Verità, a liberal commune near Ascona on Lake Maggiore. Interestingly enough, this event is mentioned in the notorious antisemitic tract Die Geheimnisse der Weisen von Zion (translated into English as The Protocols of the Elders of Zion, an immediate bestseller when published in Germany 1919). The author, whose actual name was Müller von Hausen, quotes from a letter that Reuss was alleged to have written:My secret aim for this congress is to bring together land reformers, vegetarians, Theosophists, pacifi sts . . . from Spain, Italy, Holland, Russia, France, etc. and convert their hitherto poisonous anti-German sentiments into something more fair to Germany . . . The “Anti-Nationalist Coop-erative Congress” fl ag and the draft programme are naturally merely a camoufl age. . . . Germany should send two masonic representatives who are men of the world and know the true . . . history of Freemasonry and its secret political history.72Ever a subject of controversy and scandal, Reuss has been accused of both social-political subversion and simple greed-driven chicanery. According to one account of the events at Monte Verità, Reuss’ Congress assumed “almost orgiastic qualities. An O.T.O. lodge was founded, there were ‘initiations,’ and Reuss pocketed the money received 70 Orifl amme (1912): 19–20.71 Ibid.: 20.72 Beek (pseud.), Die Geheimnisse der Weisen von Zion, 165."},{"pageNumber":451,"pageContent":"428 hugh urbanfrom successively higher degrees.”73 Indeed, more than one critic has accused Reuss of simply peddling secret degrees fi lled with tantaliz-ing esoterica to various European bourgeoisie who liked the idea of becoming “knights” and “masters” in these arcane—and deliciously transgressive—occult orders.But in this regard, Reuss was perhaps only fulfi lling his role as founder of the secret order of “Oriental Templars.” An eclectic blend of Eastern exotica and Western erotica, the O.T.O. was from its incep-tion less an embodiment of any actual Indian tradition than a product of Orientalist fantasy, nineteenth-century sexual obsession, and an ideal of radical liberation through sexual transgression.The Beast with Two Backs: Aleister Crowley and the Law of ThelemaOne of the great insights of South India is the great Temple of the Shiva lingam. I spent a good deal of time in its courts meditating on the mystery of Phallic worship . . . My instinct told me that Blake was right in saying: “The lust of the goat is the glory of God.” But I lacked the courage to admit it. The result of my training had been to obsess me with the hideously foul idea that infl icts such misery on Western minds and curses life with civil war. Europeans cannot face the facts frankly, they cannot escape from their animal appetite, yet suffer the tortures of fear and shame even while gratifying it. As Freud has now shown, this devastating complex is not merely responsible for most of the social and domestic misery of Europe, but exposes the individual to neurosis . . . We resort to suppression, and the germs create an abscess.Aleister Crowley, The Confessions of Aleister CrowleyPerhaps no fi gure would take this goal of radical liberation through sex magic and Tantra further than the O.T.O.’s most infamous member, the Great Beast, Aleister Crowley (1875–1947). As I have argued elsewhere, Crowley does not appear to have had a very deep knowledge of Indian Tantra.74 He did, however, inherit much of the Orientalist vision of the exotic, erotic East, which he melded with his own elaborate experi-73 Howe and Möller, “Theodor Reuss.”74 Urban, “Unleashing the Beast” and “The Beast with Two Backs.” For other studies of Crowley, see Owen, The Place of Enchantment; Sutin, Do What Thou Wilt."},{"pageNumber":452,"pageContent":" the yoga of sex 429ments in sexual magic (or Magick, to use Crowley’s spelling),75 and he would be credited by his later disciples as one of the fi rst adepts to synthesize Eastern Tantra with Western magic. As his biographer John Symonds remarks, “His greatest merit was to make the bridge between Tantrism and the Western esoteric tradition and thus bring together Western and Eastern magical techniques.”76 In the process, however, he would take the ideal of social and political transformation to even further extremes. As Alex Owen observes, Crowley’s sexual magical rites were “performed in a colonial context against a backdrop of fi n-de-siècle ‘decadence.’ ”77 As such, I would argue, Crowley’s sex magic takes the O.T.O.’s Orientalist dreams and libertarian fantasies to their ultimate ends.It would be diffi cult to summarize Crowley’s sexual-magical experi-mentations in a long book, much less a short article; so for the sake of brevity I will simply mention a few of his notable innovations in the practices of the O.T.O. In many ways, Crowley might be said to embody some of the deepest tensions in late Victorian English society as a whole. The son of a preacher in the highly puritanical Plymouth Brethren sect, Crowley would later turn to the most extreme forms of sensual excess, apparently not resting until he had shattered every imaginable social and religious taboo. Like many other British intel-lectuals of the late nineteenth and early twentieth century—such as Oscar Wilde, D.H. Lawrence, Havelock Ellis, Edward Carpenter and others—Crowley loathed what he saw as the stifl ing hypocrisy and repression of the Victorian era: “[ T ]o us Victoria was sheer suffoca-tion. . . . She was a huge and heavy fog; we could not see, we could not breathe. . . . [ T ]he spirit of her age had killed everything we cared for. . . . The soul of England was stagnant, stupefi ed!”78Yet Crowley also went much further than most of his generation had dared by not simply proclaiming the death of the old Victorian era, 75 Crowley uses the spelling “Magick” to distinguish his art—the art of changing nature in accordance with one’s Will—from most vulgar understandings of the term. See The Law is for All, 39, and Magick in Theory and Practice.76 Symonds, Introduction to Crowley, The Confessions of Aleister Crowley, xxv. As Grant comments, “The revival of Tantric elements in the Book of the Law may be evidence of a positive move on the part of [Crowley] to forge a link between Western and Oriental systems of magick” (The Magical Revival, 126). Popular books on Tantra/Sex Magick are too numerous to cite here: see for example the works of Christopher S.

In 1904, in fact, Crowley claimed to have received a revelation from his guardian-angel, Aiwass, who dictated to him The Book of the Law (Liber AL vel Legis).79 His most famous work, The Book of the Law announces the dawn of the third Aeon of mankind: the fi rst aeon was that of the Goddess Isis, centered around matriarchy and worship of the Great Mother; the second aeon was that of Osiris, during which the patriarchal religions of suffering and death—i.e., Judaism and Christian-ity—rose to power. Finally, with the revelation of the Book of the Law, a new aeon of the son, Horus, was born: “the old formulae . . . of the dying God is no longer effi cacious. . . . The formulae of the new Aeon recognizes Horus, the Child, crowned and conquering, as God.”80Beginning in 1910, Crowley became involved with Reuss’ O.T.O. and soon became its most infamous member. According to his own rather fanciful account, he was approached by Reuss, who had read a cryptic chapter of Crowley’s Book of Lies and accused him of revealing the innermost secret of the O.T.O.: the secret of sexual magic. Though Crowley had done so unintentionally, the story goes, he was named the Sovereign Grand Master General of Ireland, Ioana, and all the Britains. Going even further than Randolph or Reuss, Crowley identifi ed sexual magic as the most powerful of all forms of magic—a secret that even he himself had not fully understood after years of experimentation, and one so powerful that it “cannot be used indiscriminately” or revealed to the unworthy:81If this secret which is a scientifi c secret were perfectly understood, as it is not by me after more than twelve years’ almost constant study and 79 Actually, the revelation came fi rst through Crowley’s wife, Rose, during their trip to Cairo, when the voice of the god Horus began to speak through her. She later revealed that the being speaking through her was an emissary of Horus named Aiwass, and Crowley eventually claimed to have received the Book of the Law directly from Aiwass without Rose’s mediation.80 Crowley, The Law is for All, 47. See Symonds, Introduction to The Confessions, xxii.81 Crowley, The Book of Lies, 5–6. “Shortly after publication, the O.H.O. (Outer Head of the O.T.O.) came to me . . . He said that since I was acquainted with the supreme secret of the Order, I must be allowed the IX {degree} and obligated in regard to it. I protested that I knew no such secret. He said ‘But you have printed it in the plainest language’. I said that I could not have done so because I did not know it. He went to the book-shelves; taking out a copy of THE BOOK OF LIES, he pointed to a passage in the despised chapter. It instantly fl ashed upon me. The entire symbolism not only of Free Masonry but of many other traditions blazed upon my spiritual vision. From that moment the O.T.O. assumed its proper importance in my mind.

If it were desired to have an element of atomic weight six times that of uranium that ele-ment could be produced.82Like Reuss, Crowley does discuss Indian Tantric techniques and vari-ous other generic Oriental exotica. Styling himself “Mahatma Guru Sri Paramahansa Shivaji,” Crowley wrote quite a bit on hatha yoga (“yoga for yahoos”),83 and he included a discussion of Tantric sexual techniques in his De Arte Magica.84 Yet, as his own disciple Kenneth Grant acknowledges, Crowley’s references to Tantra reveal a general ignorance of actual Tantric techniques and refl ect a more widespread Orientalist stereotype of Tantric eroticism and libertinism.85In addition to quasi-Tantric references, however, Crowley also added his own interpretations and ritual fl ourishes to the O.T.O.’s magical repertoire—including a full-scale Gnostic Mass fi lled with highly erotic symbolism.86 At the same time, he also revised the O.T.O.’s hierarchy 82 Crowley, The Confessions, 767.83 Crowley, Eight Lectures on Yoga. He claimed to have achieved the highest yogic state of samadhi while meditating in Ceylon in 1901. See “The Temple of Solomon the King,” 166–7.84 “[ T ]he wise men of India have a belief that a certain particular Prana, or force, resides in the Bindu, or semen . . . Therefore they stimulate to the maximum its genera-tion by causing a consecrated prostitute to excite the organs, and at the same time vigorously withhold by will . . . [ T ]hey claim that they can defl ower as many as eighty virgins in a night without losing a single drop of the Bindu. Nor is this ever to be lost, but reabsorbed through the tissues of the body. The organs thus act as a siphon to draw constantly fresh supplies of life from the cosmic reservoir, and fl ood the body with their fructifying virtue . . . (see almost any Tantra, in particular Shiva Sanhita)” (De Arte Magica, XVI).85 See Urban, “Unleashing the Beast.” Grant recounts Crowley’s correspondence with David Curwen, who studied left-hand Tantra in South India. According to Grant’s account, Crowley was rather annoyed that Curwen seemed to possess much greater knowledge about Tantra and sexual magick; as Crowley himself admitted, “Curwen knows 100 times as much as I do about Tantra. But I do not advise it” (Letter to Grant, 1946; cited in Grant, Remembering Aleister Crowley. Curwen claimed to have a recipe for preparing the prized “Elixir of Life” that was far superior to that of the O.T.O. (ibid., 49).86 See Urban, “Unleashing the Beast.” An elaborate, highly choreographed ceremony, the Gnostic Mass is a creative re-imagining of the secret rites alleged to have been practiced by the early Gnostics and later corrupted by the Catholic Church. Although there is no physical intercourse involved in the Mass, its symbolism is highly sexual. The primary actors are the Priest, who parts a sacred veil with his “Lance,” and the Priestess, who removes her robes to embody the nakedness of the divine female prin-ciple. The Mass also involves the consumption of wine and “cakes of light,” and it is perhaps worth noting the ingredients suggested for the latter. According to the recipe provided in the Book of the Law, they are to be made with “meal & honey & thick leavings"},{"pageNumber":455,"pageContent":"432 hugh urbanof initiatic degrees, expanding them to eleven. The eighth, ninth, and eleventh of these focused on more explicitly transgressive sexual rites of auto-erotic and homosexual intercourse. As Peter König summarizes the upper degrees,Crowley’s VIIIth degree unveiled . . . that masturbating on a sigil of a demon or meditating upon the image of a phallus would bring power or communication with a divine being . . . The IXth degree was labeled heterosexual intercourse where the sexual secrets were sucked out of the vagina and when not consumed . . . put on a sigil to attract this or that demon to fulfi ll the pertinent wish . . . In the XIth degree, the mostly homosexual degree, one identifi es oneself with an ejaculating penis. The blood (or excrements) from anal intercourse attract the spirits/demons while the sperm keeps them alive.87As we can see, Crowley’s practice of sexual magic represents a radi-cal departure from the rather prudish system of Randolph; it is even more extreme than that of Reuss and much more willing to use a wide variety of non-heterosexual forms of sex magic. Indeed, his sexual pal-ate was quite eclectic. In addition to more mundane heterosexual acts, his magic sampled a smorgasbord of techniques, including “mentally meditating on his penis—masturbating—while thinking of gods and angels; consecrating talismans with combinations of semen, vaginal juices and menstrual blood; prolonging and intensifying sex through visualization . . . beseeching gods for information, money and material possessions during sex.”88 Many of Crowley’s own diaries are quite replete with detailed discussions of his own experiments in auto-erotic, heterosexual, and homosexual intercourse. Between 1914 and 1918, Crowley’s journal, Rex de Arte Regia, records a long series of 309 acts of sexual magic for a variety of purposes. These included both spiritual aims, such as offering praise to Pan or attaining supernatural powers, and more material aims, such as fascinating mistresses or enhancing his youth and sexual attraction. Of these, the largest number were employed for the purpose of generating money. Increasingly worried of red wine: then oil of Abramelin and olive oil” and softened with fresh blood. As for this last ingredient, menstrual blood is preferred.87 König, “Spermo-Gnostics and the O.T.O.” Two of the most important texts for the IX degree rituals are Liber Agape and De Arte Magica and the magical diaries based on his sexual operations: Symonds and Grant, eds.

At least in his opinion, this worked, since he claimed to receive several unexpected checks and offers showing up out of the blue.89But perhaps the most signifi cant feature of Crowley’s sexual magic was his explicit use of transgression as a ritual tool. Indeed, he seems to have taken a certain delight in inverting and tearing down the social taboos of his Victorian childhood, in ways that would have made even the most hard-core Indian Tantrika blush. I could cite a number of entertaining examples here; but for the sake of brevity, I will note just a few of the more notable ones. As we have already seen, Crowley’s higher-level rituals centered around acts that were considered extremely transgressive by Victorian standards. Sodomy and masturbation were foremost among the acts considered both physically and morally dan-gerous in Victorian society, and they would therefore become powerful tools in Crowley’s magical practice. The original preface to his The World’s Tragedy was, in fact, sub-titled “Sodomy,” in which he vowed “to fi ght openly for that which no living Englishman dared defend, even in secret—sodomy!”90However, even Crowley’s heterosexual rites would have been con-sidered somewhat against the grain of Victorian sexual values. As we have already seen, many of his practices involved deliberate inversions of “normal” sexual intercourse, such as the consumption of sexual fl uids, which were regarded as the powerful “elixir” employed in many of the IX degree operations.91 In some cases, Crowley seems to have truly exulted in his own depravity, going to great lengths to describe his descent into licentious transgression. As he described his relations 89 Skinner, The Magical Diaries of Aleister Crowley, 5–6. See Symonds and Grant, eds. The Magical Record of the Beast 666.90 Crowley, The World’s Tragedy, xxvii. One of Crowley’s most intense periods of experimentation in sex magic began in 1914, during his “Paris Workings,” conducted with the help of his lover, Victor Neuberg. Crowley engaged in a variety of rites intended to achieve the goals of invoking the gods Jupiter and Mercury. In the course of the operations, Crowley became possessed by an evil spirit posing as the god Mer-cury. This being informed them that the ultimate act of magic would require the rape, ritual murder and dissection of the body of a young girl. Yet even the Beast recoiled from this act. See King, The Magical World of Aleister Crowley, 85; Owen, The Place of Enchantment, 186ff.91 On the consumption of the “elixir” see especially De Arte Magica, chapters XIV–XVI, and Crowley’s magical records, many of which discuss preparation of the “elixir,” the commingled male and female fl uids integral to the O.T.O.

In this matter I am reproached by that whore of niggers and dogs, with whom I am now living in much worse than adultery.”92 Similarly, as he described his relations with a young American, Cecil Frederick Russell, who came to study with him in 1921 and became a partner in his sexual magic,Now I’ll shave and make up my face like the lowest kind of whore and rub on perfume and go after Genesthai [Russell] like a drunken two-bit prick-pit in old New Orleans. He disgusts me sexually, as I him, as I suspect . . . [ T ]he dirtier my deed, the dearer my darling will hold me; the grosser the act the greedier my arse to engulph him!93Crowley would go to even further extremes of transgression during his years at the Abbey of Thelema. In his diaries, he claims to have transcended all material distinctions, shattering the boundary between pure and impure, such that even the most defi ling substances—including human excrement—became for him the pure Body of God. Thus the shit of his Scarlet Woman, Leah Hirsig, became the “Thelemic Host” in his Gnostic Mass:My mouth burned; my throat choked, my belly wretched; my blood fl ed wither who knows . . . She stood above in hideous contempt . . . She ate all the body of God and with Her soul’s compulsion made me eat . . . My teeth grew rotten, my tongue ulcered, raw was my throat, spasm-torn my belly, and all my Doubt of that which to Her teeth was moonlight and to her tongue ambrosia; to her throat nectar, in her belly the One God.94While Crowley’s rituals might strike many readers as disgusting, bizarre, insane, or simply absurd, they do in fact possess a very clear and coher-ent logic. His own stated goal was nothing less than to tear down and destroy the old, dying world of Western Christianity and the prudish Victorian society in which he was raised. If this was a religion and society built upon stern sexual morality and social taboos, then the surest way to destroy that world would be to systematically overturn, invert, and violate those taboos. Only then could he hope to raise up in their place the new law of Thelema, “Do what thou wilt”: As he put it in a letter to his brother-in-law, Gerald Kelly,92 Crowley, 1918 Diary (O.T.O. Archives), cited in Sutin, Do What Thou Wilt, 265.93 Ibid., 288.94 The Magical Record of the Beast 666, 235."},{"pageNumber":458,"pageContent":" the yoga of sex 435I say today: to hell with Christianity, Rationalism, Buddhism all the lum-ber of the centuries.

A kind of “Beast with two Backs,” he was a striking exemplar of the very same late Victorian society that he fought to hard to overthrow.96 His own relentless quest for transgression, his pre-occupation with masturbation, sodomy and self-defi lement, only shows that he was never really able to transcend the taboos of his Victorian childhood. As the Schrecks observe, even Crowley, “who spent decades reacting to the sexual repression of his upbringing in an extreme Christian sect, never completely deprogrammed himself. Even in his sixties, one gets the impression he was still ‘being a bad boy,’ doing everything he could to outrage his long-dead parents.”97 By the end of his life in 1947, Crowley also seemed to have reached much the same state of exhaustion and collapse experienced by Europe at the end of World War II: like the grand ideals of European modernism, his dreams of a glorious new age of Thelema had ended not in a utopian society, but in drug addiction, loneliness, and squalor.Sex, Transgression and Liberation, East and West: A Brief ComparisonKulacara must be kept completely secret.

Lawrence” (Orthodox Heresy, 183). 97 Schreck and Schreck, Demons of the Flesh, 142."},{"pageNumber":459,"pageContent":"436 hugh urbanEven the perversions in the excrescences of most modern fermentation are at their bases of divine origin.Theodor Reuss, Introduction to Lingam-Yoni (1906)If we compare the various forms of esoteric practice found in tradi-tional Hindu Shakta Tantra and those in modern western movements like Reuss’ O.T.O., I think we fi nd both remarkable similarities and profound differences.98 Both the Shakta Tantrikas and the O.T.O. engage in deliberately transgressive ritual acts that systematically violate conventional social codes and moral laws; and in both cases, these trans-gressions center at least in part around ritualized sexual intercourse and the consumption of sexual fl uids as a source of super-human magical power. Both, moreover, are generally quite male-oriented and arguably even misogynistic in certain respects, making the male practitioner the primary benefi ciary of the rites and treating women largely as tools (perhaps dispensable ones, at that) in secret ritual.Apart from these interesting similarities, however, there are also fairly obvious and important differences between the Tantric and O.T.O. rites. First and foremost, Reuss begins from the fundamental (mis)identifi cation of Tantra with sex. Following the nineteenth-century Christian missionaries and European Orientalist scholars, Reuss defi nes Tantra essentially as “sexual worship”—the only difference being that he turns the Orientalist narrative completely on its head, by regarding this Tantric sexual worship not as a depraved confusion of religion and sensuality but as the most needed spiritual remedy for a prudish, hypocritical Christian society. From Reuss’ time onward, this basic (mis)equation of Tantra with sex has been a consistent theme in virtu-ally every popular Western text on Tantra, from Tantra without Tears to The Complete Idiot’s Guide to Tantric Sex.Second and more important, most traditional forms of Hindu Tantra are by no means the subversive, anti-social, or revolutionary force that they are commonly imagined to be by western onlookers. As we have seen in the case of Krishnananda, most Tantric authors were quite conservative and limited their transgressive actions to the confi nes of highly controlled secret ritual. Outside of the ritual circle, social boundaries and gender relations were re-asserted, indeed, argu-98 For a more detailed comparison, see Urban, “The Power of the Impure.”"},{"pageNumber":460,"pageContent":" the yoga of sex 437ably even reinforced. Conversely, Reuss and virtually all later “Western Tantrikas” have embraced Tantra as a radical force of resistance and challenge to the existing social order. Since Reuss’ time down through the sexual revolutions of the 1960s, and continuing to this day, Tantra has been transformed into what neo-Tantric guru Nik Douglas calls an “engine of political change.”99 As Nikolas and Zeena Schreck put it in their manual of twenty-fi rst-century sex magic, Tantra is the path of “social defi ance,” based on the “refusal to follow his or her society’s religious restrictions;” it is, as such, inherently opposed to any form of totalitarianism:If the left-hand path is dangerous . . . one of its primary hazards is the peril of freedom in a world almost instinctively committed to crushing liberty in whatever form it might appear. All autocracies have held sway by severely curbing the full development of sexual power in their subjects. The left hand path . . . must be viewed as a threat to any hierarchy that seeks to bridle the development of man into god.100Thus in the course of its remarkable journey to the West, Tantra has been transformed from a highly esoteric and generally conservative tradition into one of the most powerful symbols of sensual pleasure, sexual liberation, and political freedom.Conclusions: Tantra, Sex Magic and Neo-Orientalism TodayA man who desires sexual intercourse because of lust or for the sake of mere pleasure will surely go to the Raurava Hell, O Goddess.Krishnananda Agamavagisha, Brihat-Tantrasara(sixteenth century)Tantra traditions come from ancient practices in India, Nepal and China.

In the process, the sexual magic derived from Randolph and the O.T.O. would be increasingly mingled and (con)fused with a somewhat garbled version of Indian Tantra. Reuss himself seems to have been aware of the dangers of revealing these sexual secrets. Already in 1906, in his Lingam-Yoni, he predicted that these Eastern teachings on sexual magic would very likely be misunderstood and abused by many:Some Tartuffe may say that we are “immoral”, “corrupting.” etc., but we are prepared for that . . . While treating of this subject as we do in this work we will touch upon and describe many things which might inspire libertines of both sexes to perverted thoughts, which is only natural, but not our fault. To the pure, as we know, everything is pure.101The O.T.O. itself gave birth to a number of offshoots and rival move-ments, such as the Fraternitas Saturni, the Fraternitas Rosicruciana Antiqua, the Ecclesia Gnostica Catholica, the Typhonian current and the Ordo Templi Orientis Antiqua, a breakaway branch formed in 1921 which focused on sex magic and Voodoo. Today, as critics like Peter König observe, the once highly esoteric O.T.O. has become quite popularized and commercialized, as we can now discover all the secrets Tantric sex magic so long as we are prepared to pay for the costly series of initiations.102Not only did Tantra and sex magic begin to proliferate throughout these esoteric traditions, but they also began to spread throughout Western popular culture in the twentieth century. Already in 1906, the fi rst Tantrik Order in America was founded by the infamous Dr. Pierre Arnold Bernard, better known in the popular press as the “Omnipotent Oom” and the “Loving Guru.”103 By the 1960s, Tantra had become increasingly incorporated into the countercultural movement and widely associated with not just sexual freedom, but also with movements toward political liberation and social revolution. Thus, in 1964, Omar Garrison published his Yoga of Sex, promising that through Tantra yoga “man can achieve the sexual potency which enables him to extend the ecstasy crowning sexual union for an hour or more, rather than the 101 Reuss, Introduction to Lingam-Yoni.102 König, “Ordo Templi Orientis: The McDonaldisation of Occulture.”103 On Bernard see Urban, “The Omnipotent Oom.”"},{"pageNumber":462,"pageContent":" the yoga of sex 439brief seconds he now knows.”104 Finally, perhaps the most infamous Neo-Tantric master of the 1980s was Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh (a.k.a. “Osho”), the self-styled “Guru of the Rich.” As Rajneesh re-defi ned it, Tantra is the ultimate path of individual freedom and rebellion against the fi xed norms of mainstream society: “Tantra is a dangerous philoso-phy, it is a dangerous religion . . . [ M ]an has not yet been courageous enough to try it on a larger scale because the society does not allow it . . . [ T ]he society thinks this is absolute sin . . . Tantra believes in joy because joy is God.”105In sum, it would seem that the “Orient” has not simply been a realm of other-worldly mysticism and transcendent spirituality in the Western imagination, as Richard King suggests. On the contrary, there has always been another darker, more disturbing, but also more tantalizing image of in the Orient in the Western gaze: the fantasy of the exotic, erotic, hyper-sensual fantasy Orient, most clearly embodied in the Western fascination with Tantra. The O.T.O. is simply one of the more extreme examples of this fetishization of Tantra, one of the fi rst to combine Tantra with Western methods of sexual magic, and the fi rst of many to re-imagine Tantra as a path of social and political liberation. In this respect, Reuss not only foreshadowed the “sexual revolution” of the 1960s by half a century, he also helped pave the way for the sexual theories of neo-Freudians like Wilhelm Reich and Herbert Marcuse—both of whom also closely linked sexual liberation with social and political liberation.106Today, as we surf the “Tantra.com” web-site or browse our Complete Idiot’s Guide to Tantric Sex, it would seem that Tantra has been thoroughly commodifi ed and mass-marketed as the most exotic, erotic form of the exotic Orient itself. According to Kuriansky’s “idiot” version, this is a simple, direct method to achieve both sexual and spiritual ecstasy. As such, it is naturally “consistent with Western obsessions with worldly pleasures” and our quick-fi x mentality:104 Garrison, Tantra, xxviii, xxvi.105 Osho, The Tantric Transformation, 293; see Urban, Tantra, ch. 6.106 See Reich, Selected Writings: Marcuse, Eros and Civilization, 197–211. As Altman observes, “The idea of sexual liberation as integral to larger social and political liberation was an underlying theme in radical and romantic theories since the early nineteenth century and became central to both the counterculture and New Left movements of the 1970s” (Global Sex, 160)."},{"pageNumber":463,"pageContent":"440 hugh urbanAlthough tantric practices were developed in the Eastern part of the world, they are particularly . . . appealing to the Western world today . . . Tantric sex promises simple steps and instant results, which are appealing to Westerners who are conditioned to “instant” lifestyles (instant coffee, fast food, instant gratifi cation) and quick fi xes.107In short, Tantra in its Western forms has been remarkably transformed into a life-affi rming technique of self-improvement that fi ts quite nicelywith American capitalism and consumer culture. One is thus tempted to agree with König that what we are witnessing is a kind of “McDon-aldisation of occultism,” transmitting a form of “McGnosis” based on O.T.O. sex-magic: “It is only a matter of time before we see the ‘Caliphate’ not only selling T-shirts with the O.T.O.-lamen and . . . por-nography but also frozen ‘Amrita’ (the sexual-secretion cocktail) over the Internet.”108In the end, it would seem that we have not advanced all that far beyond the sexual obsessions and transgressive fantasies of our Orien-talist forefathers. If anything, our Orientalism has only expanded with the expanding networks of transnational capitalism. Today, we not only project our own suppressed desires onto the eroticized mirror of the Orient, but we also repackage these refl ected phantasms for a new generation of spiritual consumers in a much larger global marketplace of exotic religions.BibliographyAgamavagisha, Krishnananda, Brhat Tantrasara, Srirasikamohana Cattopadhyaya, ed.

Surprisingly, however, there exists—with the laudable exception of two works on the Hermetic Brotherhood of Luxor and on Paschal Beverly Randolph1—practically no critical scholarly literature that studies it as a historical phenomenon and, as a result, the infor-mation available to a wider public tends to be sensationalist, second-hand, and mostly unreliable. In this chapter we will present a factual presentation of the theories and practices of four of the most important groups and orders devoted to sexual magic in the twentieth century, based upon direct study of the relevant primary sources.2 It should be noted though that probably the most famous of these sex magical orders—Theodor Reuss’s and Aleister Crowley’s Ordo Templi Orientis (O.T.O.)—is not included in this overview, because it is the subject of a separate chapter by Hugh Urban elsewhere in this volume.The Fraternitas Saturni3The Fraternitas Saturni (FS), Germany’s most important magical order in the 20th century, was offi cially founded in Berlin on Easter, 1928. 1 See the article by John P. Deveney in this volume.2 One of the main obstacles to a critical study of sexual magic is the fact that we are mostly dealing with secret societies and initiatic orders, the documents of which are largely not available to the general public or to scholarly research. The usual reti-cence about making materials intended for internal use available to outsiders is further enhanced in the case of sexual magic, due to the controversial nature of the teachings and practices. Against this background, it is important to point out that much of the present discussion is based upon documents in a private collection (referred to in the text as PC), to which the author is fortunate to have access.3 For more detailed information in English on the Fraternitas Saturni see Flowers, Fire & Ice and a privately printed pamphlet by the same author, The Secrets of Fire and Ice. For more concise information see Hakl, “Fraternitas Saturni.” Besides books, internal magazines, and special prints, there exist seventeen mimeographed volumes of collected"},{"pageNumber":469,"pageContent":"446 hans thomas haklIn fact, however, the lodge had already started its workings two years earlier, in May, 1926. The founders were the bookseller Eugen Grosche (order name Gregor A. Gregorius, 1888–1964) and four brethren. The FS derived from the Pansophische Loge (Pansophical Lodge of Lightseek-ing Brethren of the Orient, Berlin), led by the bookseller Heinrich Tränker (order name Recnartus, 1880–1956). Since 1921, Tränker had also been Grand Master of the O.T.O. in Germany. In 1926, he had a falling-out with Aleister Crowley, who had demanded that all German lodges under the aegis of Tränker should submit to his world lodge A∴A∴ (Astrum Argentinum). This demand was rejected, and a majority of the Pansophical Lodge’s brethren left the order and became members of the newly founded FS. Nevertheless, the FS remained in contact with Crowley and even adopted a slightly adapted version of the well-known Crowleyan “Law” of the New Aeon, “Do what Thou wilt.” But organizationally and in their teachings, the FS remained completely independent. New members joined the order from Wilhelm Quintscher’s (1893–1954) Orden mentalischer Bauherren (Order of Mental Architects) after it was dissolved in 1928.During the National Socialist period the FS was banned, but after the war Eugen Grosche reassembled the former members and became their leader for the rest of his life. His death in 1964 was followed by the usual power struggle over succession, resulting in several schisms. The order managed to survive these troubles and in fact still exists today. It has an initiatic system consisting of thirty-three degrees, similar to the masonic Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite; but, naturally, it does not belong to regular Freemasonry. Its doctrines are very eclectic, with a special emphasis on astrology, and include an enormous mass of occult and magical lore, ranging from runes to the kabbalah, and from Ancient Egypt, via yoga to esoteric cosmology. In its essence, the FS is based upon a gnostic doctrine according to which man is capable of discovering his inherent divinity by means of knowledge and self-realization. As the name indicates, the FS sees itself as placed under documents and rituals, assembled by Adolf Hemberger (1929–1992) under the title Documenta et Ritualia Fraternitatis Saturni (PC). It was through Hemberger, a professor of scientifi c methodology at Giessen University and an assiduous collector of degrees in various magical orders, that practically all the internal FS-documents became known to outsiders in the 1970’s.

The order is pronouncedly anti-Christian.Contrary to current prejudice, the FS is not primarily a sex magical order like the O.T.O., and sex magical rituals and writings in fact play only a minor role in its practices and doctrinal corpus as a whole. Still, the phallus is seen as the earthly manifestation of divine power, with semen as its vehicle; and the vagina symbolizes chaos as the creative ground of being. Sexual magic is practised, but—theoretically at least—only “in order to break through the astral world and to enter higher mental levels.”4 The order is dominated by a masculine perspective and its attitude towards women is ambiguous: on the one hand, woman is regarded as a “cosmic-demonic principle,”5 but on the other, it is only through “spiritual and physical union” with her that “man became capable to act as creative principle” at all.6 The FS teaches “Tantric”7 practices for transforming the generative powers into spiritual energy and these require periods of chastity lasting up to 180 days in the case of important ritual workings; moreover, in theory at least, initiates into the highest degrees should even observe complete abstinence. These rules clearly show how different the FS is from the O.T.O.The FS’s path is “hard and solitary” indeed. Generally speaking, the male magus should have intercourse only rarely and in any case he should never give in to sexual indulgence in order not to become the slave of woman. He is allowed to ejaculate into the vagina for magical purposes only, never for personal gratifi cation. One of the main applica-tions of sex magic in the FS consists of using the female partner as a medium to facilitate magical workings in the astral sphere. This requires her to be completely subjugated to the magus sexually, so that no other magus can exert an infl uence over her. According to the teachings, this can be achieved by rubbing the magus’ semen on the woman’s solar plexus. During her period of menstruation, she should furthermore be obliged to drink his semen regularly.8 Sperm is considered to be among the most important means for magical creations, but its fl uidic forces 4 Anonymous (Gregor A. Gregorius), Sexualmagie, 83.5 Gregorius, “Das Weib als kosmisch-dämonisches Prinzip,” 6–14.6 Anonymous, Sexualmagie, 24.7 For the problematics of the term “Tantric” in this context, cf.

To achieve this goal, the magus’ sperm must be combined with the female bodily fl uids during sexual intercourse and collected from the vagina afterwards. Only such a spiritual combination of solar and lunar fl uidic forces has the power to create astral beings. The magus and his medium must be protected by a magical circle during the ritual because astral vampires are said to be always present at such occasions. The astral beings believed to be created through sexual magic can be used for all kinds of practical magical work. For this purpose they must be “tied” to a symbol or kabbalistic name, that is written on a parchment saturated with a mixture of the female and male fl uids.9 Certain drugs, like cannabis or opium, may also be used in their creation—as well as in other sex magical operations—in order to enhance the power of visualization and for fumigation purposes.10 This procedure for creating new astral beings with clearly defi ned char-acters must be strictly distinguished, according to the FS’s teachings, from the invocation or evocation of already existing angels, demons, or other spiritual beings.One ritual used in this context is the so called 5 M Rite, clearly derived from the Tantric practice of consuming the fi ve M’s (mansa, meat; matsya, fi sh; mudra, grain; madya, wine; and maithuna, intercourse). The magician and his medium consume a ritual meal prepared from the fi rst four M’s. They are both in a state of high erotic tension, due to a previous period of chastity and hence have plenty of “odic force” at their disposal. Within a magical circle, the magus now puts his medium into a trance by means of so-called banishing magic and proceeds to draw odic force from her chakras,11 which he then directs through his own body and fi nally projects onto a parchment. This procedure is repeated seven to nine times. It is followed by ritual intercourse, after which the parchment is soaked with the combined essences dripping 9 Ibid., 80, 81, 93, 94.10 Ibid., 92. The necessarily careful use of so-called witch-ointments containing henbane, belladonna, thorn apple etc. to be rubbed into the area of the sexual organs and under the armpits, was also regarded as helpful for all kinds of sex magical operations.11 After the rite the magician is, however, obliged to replenish the odic force of his medium."},{"pageNumber":472,"pageContent":" the theory and practice of sexual magic 449from the vagina. Alcohol and three drops of blood from the “Saturnian” (i.e. the middle) fi nger of the magus are added.12 Astrological conditions have to be observed very carefully: even the sexual positions taken by the partners depend on them.13Sexual magic is also used for the activation and development of the chakras, because it is said to increase their ethereal forces. For this purpose certain runic and yogic positions are prescribed.14 Similarly, intercourse is seen as a means of harmonizing the magical odic fl uids between man and woman.15 A specifi c degree focused on sexual magic in the FS is the 18th degree, called Gradus Pentalphae. The rite of inita-tion involves ritual intercourse in front of the members who already hold the 18th degree. In the course of this ritual, a living black cock is decapitated, and its blood spilled over the couple while they are engaged in intercourse. The magus’s ejaculation must take place outside the vagina through vigorous rubbing of the penis by the female partner, while the other sisters and brethren yell ecstatically. At the end, a clean white cloth is placed over the couple.16 It is not certain that this rite has ever been put into actual practice, and if so, how often.In addition to it, there exists a document17 called The Symbolism of the Gradus Pentalphae, the original of which is in the handwriting of Mstr. Daniel (pseudonym of Guido Wolther, who became Master of the Chair in 1966) and preserved in an exercise book. It contains many sigils and very explicit drawings, plus some text. Right at the beginning we fi nd a very clear guideline: “Strict rejection of homosexuals and pederasts as magical sexual monsters.” The text also contains “The Secret of the Sexual Power of the Magus Pentalphae,” which explains a procedure through which the magus can perform the sexual act up to ten times in one session. It also gives advice to female holders of this degree, on how to sexually vampirize non-initiated males; these can be “thrown away like used gloves” once they are no longer able to provide the 12 Hemberger, Organisationsformen, 109–112.13 Gregorius, Die astrologischen Aspektzeichen (English translation in King, Sexuality, Magic, & Perversion, 116–119).14 Anonymous, “Sexualmagie” (reserved for holders of the eighteenth degree).15 Gregorius, “Der Sexualverkehr.”16 Hemberger, Organisationsformen, 138–140.

Again, whether the instructions in this document were ever put to practice is very doubtful.18Giuliano Kremmerz, the Fraternity of Myriam and the Ordine Osirideo EgizianoApart from some passages in English editions of books by Julius Evola, nothing about the sexual magical doctrines of the various Italian groups directed by Giuliano Kremmerz (pseudonym of Ciro Formisano, 1861–1930) has ever been published in English. Texts by Kremmerz himself exist only in Italian and French. Actually, however, the sexual magical system practiced in these groups is arguably the most intricate and well-developed among all the magical organisations known in the Western world.Kremmerz19 has long been known in Italy and among specialists in France as one of the great fi gures of the Italian magical scene, next to Julius Evola (1898–1974) and Arturo Reghini (1878–1946). His voluminous Opera Omnia consists of nearly 1,500 pages, but does not contain any of the internal instructions used within his magical orders. Hence, until the mid-1980’s, very little was known about his sexual magic except for what he had written himself in one of his magazines, Il Mondo secreto: Avviamento alla Scienza dei Magi (1896–1899) (The Secret World: Introduction to the Science of the Magi),20 in his booklet I Tarocchi dal punto di vista fi losofi co (The Tarot from a Philosophical Perspective),21 and fi nally in his Angeli e Demoni dell’Amore (Angels and Demons of Love), where he made the important distinction between love directed by the mind (which he considered impure) and love directed by the heart and dedicated to the angels.18 It has even been suggested that Adolf Hemberger, in whose possession the original document remained until his death, was more or less cheated by Mstr. Daniel, who produced this document for him simply because he was paid for it; the latter has, however, denied this vehemently in a personal interview with the author.19 For a short introduction in English, see Introvigne, “Kremmerz, Giuliano.” For a very good overview of his general magical philosophy, see Di Vona, Giuliano Kremmerz.20 A complete reprint of the magazine, in two large volumes and in a limited num-bered edition, has been published in 1982: see Pierini, Il Mondo Secreto.21 Reprinted in Kremmerz, Opera Omnia, vol. II, 299–364 and in Kremmerz, I Tarocchi. He discusses erotic magic in the chapter about the Tarot card “The Lovers.”"},{"pageNumber":474,"pageContent":" the theory and practice of sexual magic 451The teachings discussed in these writings explain how to induce the “lighting of a psychic fi re” (pir), based upon the complementary mag-netism of the female (passive) and male (active) polarities. This fi re is aroused in a man and a woman by developing a very strong mutual attraction without any possibility of releasing it through a physical relationship. The man and woman then “use” the mutual erotic “fl u-ids” as a means to enter transcendent states. Mere carnal desire must be overcome, as it would paralyse the active magical “state of mag.” The aim seems to be the attainment of a kind of androgynous state for man and woman.22 The procedure is reminiscent of the so-called Fedeli d’Amore of the Middle Ages, although women seem to be more strongly involved in Kremmerz’s case.But rumors existed about a more secret sexual teaching by Kremmerz, that supposedly went far beyond what he had described in these publi-cations. Then, at the end of the 1980’s, all of a sudden a group known as Prometeo/Agape in Milan, under the leadership of Paolo Fogagnolo (an ex-member of the dreaded revolutionary and pro-communist Red Brigades), published the so-called “Corpus” of Kremmerz in a small and strictly limited number of copies and at a high price.23 A veritable scandal broke loose, accusations of treason and theft, and even threats of assassination were uttered. People of opposed factions attacked each other when they met in the street, and several Kremmerzian groups were shut down. Regardless of the nature of their involvement (if any) in sexual magic, nearly all the organisations and activities related to Kremmerz were affected heavily by these events and in fact are still suffering from them today.Before going into the details of Kremmerz’s teachings, it is necessary to give some background about Kremmerz himself and the tradition to which he claimed to belong.24 Giuliano Kremmerz, whose real name 22 See Kremmerz, Opera Omnia, vol. I, 146, 351–352, 390ff., vol. II, 330–331.23 Kremmerz, Corpus philosophorum totius magiae. Heavily expurgated reprints of the Corpus had been around at least since 1981, when the Milan-based Association of Symbolical and Alchemical Studies Kemi published a version of it, in which many of the numbered sections were kept blank, and marked with the word “omissis.”24 Probably the most accurate biography of Kremmerz is Verniero, Giuliano Krem-merz. Unfortunately only its fi rst part, which stops at around 1900, has been published. The rest, which could shed some badly needed light on the secret teachings which interest us here, has never been made public and is kept in the safe of a lawyer, a friend of A. Verniero’s son.

From his childhood onwards (he lived in Portici near Naples) he is said to have been in contact with the most important members of a pagan and strongly anti-Christian group called Scuola di Napoli (the School of Naples). This group supposedly devoted itself to alchemical and magical workings, but unfortunately we have no documentary proof that it actually existed. It was believed to hail back to the Prince Raimondo di Sangro di San Severo, Duke of Torremaggiore (1710–1771),25 one of the most controversial fi gures in eighteenth-century Italy. Di Sangro was the fi rst Grand Master of Freemasonry in Naples and a known alchemist rumoured to have tried to create a homunculus. Furthermore, he was a lover of great art and had employed the famous Antonio Corradini to create sculptures for a marvelous underground chapel, which also served him as a labora-tory.26 The Pope had excommunicated him. Not unfi ttingly he died by accidentally poisoning himself in the course of one of his alchemical experiments.Still in Naples, the famous magician and impostor Count Cagliostro (pseudonym of Giuseppe Balsamo, 1743–1795), who was certainly in contact with di Sangro, developed his Egyptian Rites.27 Tradition had it that they contained secret degrees, named Arcana Arcanorum, consisting of a kind of internal alchemy aimed at the formation of an indestructible “glorious body”: a subtle bodily vehicle by means of which one could achieve immortality. We do not know for certain where Cagliostro got these ideas, although Massimo Introvigne has suggested28 that while travelling though Germany, Cagliostro may have come into contact with certain groups belonging to the Gold- und Rosenkreuzer and, especially, Giuliano Kremmerz. The book contains extracts of letters by Kremmerz written to his daughter and brother in law.25 For a short overview in English, see Introvigne, “Sangro di San Severo, Raimondo di.”26 See, among others, Vagni, Raimondo di Sangro. In Cioffi , La Cappella Sansevero one can admire photos of this incredibly sumptuous chapel, which is now a public museum.27 For a short introduction in English, see Introvigne, “Cagliostro, Alessandro di”; and cf.

In the absence of hard evidence, such a line of transmission must remain no more than a hypothesis.Cagliostro’s legacy of the secret “Egyptian” degrees is said to have been passed on to three important members of an “Ordine Egizio,” out of which came Kremmerz’s Ordine Osirideo Egiziano.30 The fi rst was Baron Nicola Giuseppe Spedalieri (1812–1898), who was a pupil of Eliphas Lévi and maintained a voluminous correspondence with him. The second was the lawyer Giustiniano Lebano (1832–1909), who also was in contact with Eliphas Lévi and owned a very large library of occult works. Lebano received occultists from the whole of Europe, reput-edly including personalities as famous as Sir Edward Bulwer Lytton, Helena P. Blavatsky, Dr. Franz Hartmann, and, of course, Giuliano Kremmerz.31 Unfortunately, Lebano’s papers, manuscripts, and books were lost when his wife committed suicide by burning herself and all the papers in an attempt to expiate what she regarded as her husband’s magical wrongdoings. The third person, fi nally, was Pasquale de Servis (1837–1893), who lived in the house in Portici where the young Ciro Formisano grew up.After his student years, Formisano briefl y worked as a professor of geography and then became a journalist. Next, he seems to have lived for some years in South America, from where he returned a rich man. He immediately started publishing esoteric magazines. In 1907, he moved to Ventimiglia, then to Camogli on the Italian Riviera, and from there to Beausoleil on the Côte d’Azur, where he died in 1930. 29 For the Gold und Rosenkreuzer, see McIntosh, The Rose Cross and the Age of Reason, and Geffarth, Religion und arkane Hierarchie. For the Asiatic Brethren, see Katz, Jews and Freemasons in Europe, ch.

Famous in magical circles are the stories about Kremmerz going to Monte Carlo to play roulette and win whenever he so desired.In 1898, Kremmerz distributed a circular letter announcing the foundation of a “spiritualistic, magical fraternity” called the Fratellanza Terapeutica Magica di Miriam (The Therapeutic Magic Brotherhood of Miriam), dedicated to the study and practice of hermetic medicine.32 Patients were being cured by means of magnetic strokes and ritual prayers: by these means, the malevolent spirits, which caused all illnesses according to the fraternity’s teachings, could be driven out.33 The Fraternity of Miriam really seems to have been an order dedicated to healing the sick and according to the stories which have come down to us, must have been quite successful. But behind the order of Miriam another order seems to have been hidden, with practices of a completely dif-ferent kind: this was the Ordine Osirideo Egiziano.The study of this group is made particularly diffi cult by the fact that the primary sources now at our disposal are not only scarce, but often of dubious authenticity as well. In fact, in most cases it is practi-cally impossible to ascertain whether the documents one has in hand have been actually written by Kremmerz himself, or by members of his groups, or may even have been forged by adversaries in order to blacken Kremmerz’s reputation.34 Moreover, even if the documents are genuine, it is not at all clear whether, and if so, to what extent, Kremmerz was personally involved in the rituals and exercises to be described here. There are those who reject the sex magical documents circulating under his name as forgeries or as the products of schismatic currents subsequent to Kremmerz and affi rm that he personally limited himself to the “piromagia” or amorous magic described in his own 32 For the history of this order see Ja-Hel, La Pietra Angolare Miriamica, which is valu-able for its reprints of internal correspondence.33 See Kremmerz, Istruzioni Magiche, in which the editor, collector and great admirer of Kremmerz, Pier Luca Pierini, has reprinted Kremmerz’s Bulletin “La Medicina Ermetica” (1899), with instructions for the members of Miriam. In the book edited by Agape, La Magia della Myriam, more internal instructions are given. Besides prayers, one can also fi nd there instructions for rituals as well as the sigils of genies and angels. 34 These documents used to circulate in the form of photocopies, were very hard to come by, and then only at a high price. In the meantime many of them have been reprinted in brochures, or can even be found on the Internet.

After years of dispute among the proponents of these various perspectives, a certain consensus now seems to have emerged, according to which the three-volume Corpus philosophorum totius magiae published by Agape is indeed the work of Kremmerz, even though some other members of his order might have had a hand in it too. With respect to other documents, the dispute continues, particularly about some of those published under the title Lo Sputo della Luna36 (The Spit of the Moon) by Vittorio Fincati and his publishing house Letture S . . . consigliate.37 My description of the rituals and procedures will therefore be based mainly on the Corpus as edited by Agape and some other documents published by the same editor in the book Scopi e pratiche alchemiche dell’Ordine Osirideo Egizio.The fi rst volume of the Corpus, called “Preparation,” begins with the statutes and articles of the Ordine Egizio. Its sole aim, according to thestatutes, is the perpetuation of the Arcane and Sacred Sciences. Mem-bers are asked to keep away from politics and profane interests and to concentrate on the magical studies and practices taught in the order. In return for doing so, they are promised health, good fortune, wealth, and honor. Those who work incessantly will even “conquer the light.” A short course on the fundamentals of magic follows, with emphasis on the importance of Love.One of the basic principles of sex magic is described with reference to sexual union. “Whoever copulates thinks, imagines, projects the real-ity of his thought into the sperm. . . . The female blood nourishes and feeds this image projected into the sperm, because woman is subject to the male thought due to her desire and voluptuousness.”38 The text also states that a woman can be infl uenced only “when she is hot.” If 35 See e.g., Horus “Demotismo antiermetico o pandemia dissacrante?”36 Fincati, Lo sputo della Luna, which also describes vampiric practices with human blood. Similar skepticism can be applied to Fincati, Ci prude il muladhara (Our mulad-hara is so itchy).37 Vittorio Fincati has also published writings of other authors associated with sexual magic, such as the Chevalier Clément de Saint-Marcq (on whom see Pasi’s chapter in the present volume) or the so-called Satanist priestess Maria de Naglowska, on whom see below.38 Kremmerz, Corpus, I, 45."},{"pageNumber":479,"pageContent":"456 hans thomas haklthis condition is fulfi lled, a man is capable of changing her completely and may turn her into his servant as well as into an ascetic nun. If, however, “she is not burning with desire, do not try.”39 Violence is not recommended, because “in nature everything is achieved by degrees.”40 Preparation by means of long periods of fasting and absolute chastity, in body, mind and emotion, is necessary in order to become master of oneself and build up a superior force.The second volume, called La Sofi a (wisdom, i.e. magical knowledge) teaches how to reach the state of mag (the active magical state, which is needed to be able to work on the hidden planes) and discusses the possibility of consciously separating one’s “soul” from one’s body and directing it wherever one wishes. Instructions on how to prepare talismans for protection and for accomplishing these magical aims are also given. The third volume, Del separando magico (Of the Magical Separated Soul), is probably the most important one, because it gives exact instructions pertaining to the practices and rituals by which one can give birth to a “glorious body,” as vehicle for the voluntary sepa-ration of one’s “soul.” In the fi rst, more theoretical part, the alchemi-cal mercury is identifi ed as sperm. This is followed by prayers and sigils for the practical work. The path to be followed consists of three degrees, plus a Great Arcanum at the end. The fi rst degree starts with long ritual fasting, total chastity, breathing exercises, and various other preparations. Next, according to a very precise sequence determined by astrological cycles, the man must “assimilate,” that is to say, ingest his own sperm obtained through masturbation. One should not think lightly about all this: the short cycle of these rituals alone consists of no less than 40 “operations” of this type, one every nine days (nine being the number of the moon). Women can practice the ritual too: instead of sperm, they ingest their own sexual secretions, obtained by an auto-erotic technique during their menstrual period. Successively there are further so-called coobazioni (literally: repeated distillations of a liquid, to enrich its effi cacy), that is to say, ingestions of the same substances. This time, however, another substance must be added to them: in most cases, a not yet fertilized dove’s egg.41 In the second degree, the male and female secretions are mixed, and the mixture is ingested together 39 Kremmerz, Corpus, I, 125.40 Kremmerz, Corpus, I, 125.41 See the article of Ilario Brandano (pseudonym of a longstanding Kremmerzian practitioner), “Das alchemistische Geheimnis in der Schule von Giuliano Kremmerz.”"},{"pageNumber":480,"pageContent":" the theory and practice of sexual magic 457with the egg. For the third degree, this mixture must be “cooked” by the couple in three “rounds,” by way of various operations of sexual magic in which always both partners are involved. The fi nal phase—the Great Arcanum—consists of fi ve “retreats in the dark,”42 each one last-ing seven days, during which the coobazioni of the male respectively the female secretions are continued separately. All these degrees are strictly subject to precise astrological laws and consist of several cycles; as a result, they require a lot of time to complete.What is the aim of all these instructions? Certainly not a refi nement of sexual pleasures, a subjugation of women, kinky sex games, or sexual liberation. By means of a prolonged regimen of fasting, breathing exercises, prolonged chastity, meditation, and years of general magical preparation, a superior magical force is to be developed: a force so strong that it should be capable of conquering everything, even physical death. Central to the instructions is the “practice of separation.” This is an operation of “internal alchemy” (the body being the laboratory, that contains all the substances and instruments needed for the Great Work), which requires a perfect knowledge of one’s own body and its various hidden planes. During this operation, the solar spiritual part of man is slowly separated from his physiological, astral, and mental components. At the same time, another “body” must be built: the so-called “glorious body” as a new vehicle that will carry the separated part corresponding to the spiritual Self of the magus. Once this Self is able to make use of this new vehicle, it no longer needs the physi-cal body, and hence death is of no importance to it. The Self with its glorious body will survive in another sphere of reality, as long as the internal power of the Self is strong enough to resist the forces of dissolution. Thus the goal of the Arcana Arcanorum is quite clear: it is to become immortal and godlike.These practices are already provocative enough, but the so-called “Magia Avatarica” (Magic of the Avatars) has evoked even more protest and feelings of disgust. What does it consist of ? In volume II of the Corpus, the question is raised of whether there is any scientifi c and experimental proof for the belief that the human soul is actually inde-pendent from the physical body and therefore potentially immortal.4342 More details in Agape, Scopi e pratiche alchemiche, 195–196. This volume also reveals the detailed practices of the three degrees, 165–166.43 Kremmerz, Corpus, II, 51–52."},{"pageNumber":481,"pageContent":"458 hans thomas haklThe answer is in the affi rmative and boldly states that this proof can-not be refuted by anyone. It is to be found in what is called Magia Avatarica:This Magia Avatarica . . . consists of a mysterious chemistry by which in a living and intelligent body the soul is separated, and inserted defi nitely or temporarily into another body, from which the [original] soul has been removed beforehand, or in the exchange of the soul of a living body by the soul of a genius, a hero or a deity (numen).44In other words, a master is supposedly capable of driving out the soul from a young and healthy body and replacing it with his own. When-ever a new body is needed, one can repeat the procedure and hence live “eternally.”The second part of this defi nition of the avataric method is perhaps even more startling. From the available documents, it seems clear that every aspirant to the Order’s higher degrees has to undergo a blood pact, sealed by one’s semen or menstrual blood, which binds him or her indissolubly to a spirit or deity (numen) that henceforth represents one’s personal “gate” to the “otherworld.” Apparently, in the course of the initiations this numen gradually takes total control over the body of the aspirant, whose “old” soul must simultaneously be driven out. This is why all members of the Order are known by the name of their numen: for example, Kremmerz—or rather Kremm-Erz—is not meant to be a normal pseudonym, but the name of the numen which had taken the place of the soul of the ordinary person formerly called Ciro Formisano.This is supposedly also the secret behind the “marriages” of human beings and elemental beings, such as undines, described in the famous Comte de Gabalis by the Abbé de Montfaucon de Villars. “Possession” by a numen is furthermore adduced as explanation of the magical pow-ers attributed to the members of the Order. The practices are said to go back to Assyrian/Babylonian magical rituals for reviving the dead. An author writing under the pseudonym of Alexandre de Dánann has dedicated an entire book to attacking these practices and providing them with a historical as well as esoteric background.45Morally disgusting as this practice may appear to some, it could be argued that Christian mysticism, with its concept of dissolving one’s 44 Kremmerz, Corpus, II, 52–53.45 De Dánann, Mémoire du sang."},{"pageNumber":482,"pageContent":" the theory and practice of sexual magic 459own Ego and letting Christ take its place, is based on a similar prin-ciple. Likewise, a famous mystical instruction, such as that of letting the “old Adam” die so that the “new Adam” can live, suggests that the old Ego has to vanish and a “new spirit” takes over. Of course, thequestion remains which “spirit” that is: while Christians regard Jesus Christ as God, for a believer in Kremmerz’s magical system at least some of the numina may appear as gods as well. Incredible though it might seem at fi rst sight, one can therefore understand why among the various organisations deriving from Kremmerz or his groups, some consider themselves to be genuinely Christian. One such group, calling itself Ordine Essenico Occidentale (Essenian Occidental Order) was led by Erim (pseudonym of Count Umberto Amedeo Alberti di Catenaia, 1879–1938), whose pupil Paolo M. Virio (pseudonym of Paolo Mar-chetti, 1910–1969) is equally well-known for his abundant—although veiled—literary production.46 In these Christian Kremmerzian circles, however, sexual magic is allowed only between married couples, of which both partners must be practising Christians and have previously received a very serious Christian education. It is maintained that other-wise only phantasms will be created, which then become inhabited by evil demons. Still, the goal remains the same: the creation of a body of light that is said to grant immortality.It was Kremmerz himself who took the initiative to found several so-called Academies in various Italian towns (Rome, Florence, Bari). After his death, they soon went their own way, with all the ego-clashes, jealousies, and dogmatic changes known from other similar instances. Groups inspired by Kremmerz’s teachings have survived to the present day, in spite of the turmoil unleashed by the publication of the Corpus and other secret materials. The precise instructions, however, are differ-ent with almost every organization.47 Some of them completely reject sexual magical teachings and concentrate on healing in the tradition of the Order of Miriam. Even some celebrities have joined Kremmerz’ organisations. Thus in the Florence Academy one could fi nd Nino Rota, who composed the music for nearly all of the movies by Federico Fellini, but also for the famous mafi a movie The Godfather and for Franco 46 See Paolo Virio, Esoterismo cristiano e amore, Luciana Virio, Paolo M. Virio. Esempio di vita and Claudio Lanzi “Paolo e Luciana Virio,” which is the introduction to Paolo e Luciana Virio, Le lettere e la vita.47 The instructions used here and taken from the published Corpus, seem to come from the C.E.U.R.

Vinci Verginelli, who assembled one of the most beautiful collections of illuminated alchemical manuscripts in the world48 and was one of the last direct pupils of Kremmerz, headed the Academy of Rome. Unfortunately he burned all his correspondence with Kremmerz before his death in 1987.The rituals and practices of the Ordine Osirideo Egizio are also present in France. For example there is an Ordre Souverain Interne et Hermétique d’Atoum (Sovereign Internal and Hermetic Order of Atoum, OSIHA), which has translated many manuscripts into French.49 One of its leading members is Count Jean-Pierre Giudicelli de Cressac Bachelerie, who has disclosed much on the secret background of Italian and French orders in his book Pour la Rose Rouge et la Croix d’Or. He combines Kremmerz’s teachings with Taoist alchemy. At the end of his book,50 interestingly enough, the famous scholar of Taoism Cathérine Despeux gives a short overview of Taoist alchemy. This includes a description of a female path to salvation called the “Decapitation of the Red Dragon,” by means of which the menstrual cycle must be stopped as a precondition for the fi nal goal. Strangely, other countries have not yet been touched by the teachings of Kremmerz, although the relevant materials have been available for nearly twenty years now.Julius Evola and the UR GroupThe Italian Julius Evola (1898–1974) had many faces. In the English-speaking world he is quite well known as a Traditionalist and author on esoteric subjects and especially as a political writer with fascist and racist leanings. But he was also a philosopher in the tradition of Novalis, Max Stirner, and Nietzsche and a founder of Italian Dadaism whose paintings are still exhibited in major museums of modern art. Still less known is his—admittedly highly individualistic—involvement in the history of Comparative Religion. Through his writings and translations, he was instrumental in making Tantrism and Zen Bud-dhism known in Italy; he sought to spread his own interpretation of the original teachings of Buddhism; he published two translations of 48 See Verginelli, Bibliotheca Hermetica.49 The order consists of three classes: black, white and red. The translations have appeared under the imprint of Isolément Silence, Cercles Atoum, in A4 mimeographed manuscripts.50 Giudicelli de Cressac Bachelerie, Pour la Rose Rouge, 187–190."},{"pageNumber":484,"pageContent":" the theory and practice of sexual magic 461the Tao Te Ching into Italian (not from the original Chinese, however); and for longer or shorter periods of time, he was in contact with the likes of Mircea Eliade, Giuseppe Tucci, Sir John Woodroffe, Raffaele Pettazzoni, and Karoly Kerényi.51But most relevant in the present context is Evola as a “metaphysician of sex.” To understand his vision of sexuality, or rather of eros and sexual magic, we must start with the Platonic myth of the androgyne as told in Plato’s Symposion.52 According to this myth, there originally existed three human sexes: males, females, and hermaphrodites. When they attempted to attack the gods, Zeus decided to cut them into two parts. Ever since, each separated half longs to be reunited with its counterpart: those who originally belonged to a male are attracted to other men, those who belonged to a female are attracted to other females, and those who belonged to a hermaphrodite are attracted to the other sex.In discussing this myth in his book Metafi sica del Sesso (The Metaphysics of Sex),53 Evola makes clear right away that for him sexual desire goes far beyond the level of mere biology. He sees it as a force of attraction that ultimately aims at the metaphysical and primordial unity of man and cosmos. For him, sexuality is therefore inextricably bound up with a profoundly religious drive.54 Only this unity can give true meaning to human life and quench man’s deep metaphysical thirst. For Evola, it is simply not permissible to speak of real freedom, real knowledge, and real power before having achieved this unity.Here is also the point of contact between Evola’s sexual and cosmo-logical theories. Basic to his metaphysical cosmology as well is the idea of a primordial unity which has divided itself into two complementary “parts,” analogous to the Taoist theory of Yin and Yang deriving from the one Tao. Likewise, according to Evola, Aristotle distinguished between the nous or active spiritual power, and physis or the passive matrix. From that perspective, “male” (activity, spirit) and “female” (passivity, life) are two transcendental and primordial categories, and 51 On this side of Evola, see Hakl, “Evola, Julius.”52 Plato, Symposium 189–193d (speech of Aristophanes).53 Evola, Metafi sica del Sesso, 42–45.54 It may be pointed out here that this yearning for a transcendental primordial unity characterizes all of Evola’s thinking, from his dadaistic pictures and poems, to his philosophy, his magic, and even his politics and racial theories."},{"pageNumber":485,"pageContent":"462 hans thomas haklthe differentiation into male and female here on earth is but a necessary and inevitable refl ection of this.Since sexuality is therefore immediately linked to a transcendent cosmological order, it provides a direct pathway to this longed-for transcendent realm. And more than that: for Evola, it is actually the only way in which mankind may still ascend to transcendence in the present “Iron Age” or kali-yuga. Only by using sexuality’s primordial energy, he says, is it still possible to return to the original unity of cosmos and man. The path of sexuality is therefore the religious way towards salvation par excellence. It is for this reason that Evola fought against the banalization of sexuality through its commercialization in the popular media, pornography, and the like. If nudity and “free sex” is everywhere, woman loses her power of fascination over man and the erotic tension vanishes; but precisely this tension is the only means by which man—and man alone: woman being “earthbound” in Evola’s Traditionalist vision—can be propelled into transcendence. Hence Evola feared that the trend towards “sexual liberation” would end up barring even this last way of access to “heaven”: only a spir-itual elite fully conscious of what was at stake was permitted to use sexuality freely. It may be noted here that, prior to being paralyzed in 1945, Evola himself led a “loose” life sexually, including affairs with the foremost early Italian feminist thinker Sibilla Aleramo (pseudonym for Rina Faccio, 1876–1960: a leading member of the Italian Com-munist Party and a successful author) and probably also with Maria de Naglowska (see below).55Between 1927 and 1929, Evola was the leader of a highly intrigu-ing magical group bearing the name of UR,56 which counted among its members not only persons with purely esoteric interests, but also poets such as Arturo Onofri and Girolamo Comi, and the “father of psychoanalysis in Italy,” Emilio Servadio.57 It is not fully known, how-ever, which members participated in the actual ritual workings of UR and which ones contributed only to its theoretical background. Nor do 55 See Hansen (ps. Hans Thomas Hakl), “Julius Evola und der Sexus.”56 For historical data of the UR Group see Del Ponte, Evola e il magico “Gruppo di UR.” In English, see Del Ponte, “Julius Evola and the UR Group.” The word Ur is linked to fi re; according to Kremmerz the word pir is derived from it, and means the transforming alchemical fi re (Kremmerz, Corpus III, 33).57 Anonymity was strictly enforced in the group, and while the persons here men-tioned are now known to have been members, the real identity of some others remains unknown."},{"pageNumber":486,"pageContent":" the theory and practice of sexual magic 463we know whether the sexual magic described in the sources was really practised as part of the group’s work. Personally, the present author doubts it, although certain specifi c members most probably had some experience in this domain.One member is of particular importance for us here: Ercole Qua-drelli, whose pseudonym of Abraxa appears as the author of the only two pieces on sexual magic to be published in the collected UR essays,58 although he probably just furnished the contents, which were then reformulated and written down by Evola.59 Quadrelli had been a member of a Kremmerzian Academy and had brought his knowledge to UR. Both the essays on sexual magic are therefore clearly infl uenced by Kremmerz’s teachings. It was Evola himself who pointed this out in 1958, in the chapter on the Brotherhood of Miriam in his Metafi sica del Sesso. Evola himself had never been a member of any Kremmerzian organisation.60What, then, is the teaching found in these two essays that must be attributed to Abraxa and only partly to Evola?61 In the fi rst piece, two operations are described, the fi rst of which cannot be properly called sex magic: the magus brings a young girl into an altered state of con-sciousness in which she is to explore the so-called astral world and report what she sees. The second operation, however, uses love as an element for “igniting” special fl uidic forces.62 It is explicitly love and not sexual desire: intended here is “love” in the sense of something very subtle and vast, enveloping the whole of the other person without a strong physiological-sexual polarisation. It is the soul, the essence, which must be desired, not the body. Man and woman sit in front of each other 58 These essays came from group members and were published in monthly magazines from 1927–1929 under the name of Ur, and in 1929 under the name of Krur. In the 1950’s, Evola revised the contents and brought them out in three volumes under the title Gruppo di Ur, Introduzione alla magia quale scienza dell’Io. In 1971, he revised them a second time.59 Del Ponte, Evola e il magico “Gruppo di UR,” 59.60 It is rumored that he was not willing to wait for years until reaching the top of the order but wanted to enter immediately at a very high level, which was not permit-ted. But there also exist important dogmatic differences between UR and Kremmerz’s philosophy.61 The fi rst essay has been translated into English under the title “Magical Opera-tions with ‘Two Vessels’ – Reduplication,” in Evola & the UR Group, Introduction to Magic. This book comprises the contributions of the fi rst volume of Introduzione alla Magia. The second essay was included in the second volume and is titled “Magia dei congiungimenti”; it has not yet been translated into English.62 Naturally, this recalls Kremmerz’s “piromagia.”"},{"pageNumber":487,"pageContent":"464 hans thomas haklwithout moving. Loving and longing for each other without movement or contact, they reach out to each other continuously and steadily, until, little by little, they reach a state of exaltation or vertigo, described as so intensive that it cannot be imagined by “ordinary” people. Abraxa describes it as follows: “You will have a sense of effective amalgamation, a feeling of the other in your whole body, not through contact but in a subtle embrace that is felt there in every point and penetrates you like an intoxication that possesses the blood of your blood.”63The goal is not this state of exaltation itself, but the point of magical equilibrium at which the ignited fl uid can be “projected” into the goal one wishes to achieve. A woman can abandon herself to the state of exaltation, but the man, as the “magician,” must fi nd a balance between resisting and letting go—somewhat like windsurfi ng on a huge wave. His exaltation must be “conducted” by a transcendent cold, crystalline principle which the magus has invoked and identifi ed with beforehand, and which must not diminish.Clear warnings are given about the risks of the operation: if the magus cannot resist, he may “drown” in this wave of fl uidic energy. If he is lucky, in such a case he will merely experience a mystical state of psychic voluptuousness of the kind we know from certain religious mystics. But he may also fall victim to a “sexual possession,” of which there is little chance of recovery: in such a case, the magus will be continuously assaulted by sexual desires that cannot possibly be satis-fi ed, leading to very severe psychical disturbances and eventually to sexual crimes or suicide.The second essay by Abraxa and Evola describes a magical practice in which the couple engages in full sexual union. A precondition is that the operation without physical contact, described in the fi rst essay, has been mastered to perfection: otherwise, the male will not have the spiritual power necessary to resist dissolution. As we know from the traditional cosmology already outlined, woman is identifi ed with theprinciple of Life. The teaching of UR now says that during the sexual embrace this principle of Life, representing the very essence of woman, can manifest itself and appear in its “naked,” that is to say its original transcendent form. We normally believe that we possess life, but the doctrine of UR affi rms just the contrary: it is Life which possesses us. As Abraxa explains: “Life simply drifts away from you just as from a 63 Julius Evola and the UR Group, Introduction to Magic, 223."},{"pageNumber":488,"pageContent":" the theory and practice of sexual magic 465withered tree to pass on to other beings, other ephemeral lights in the same game. Like a deadly torch the living pass Life on from one to the other by consuming themselves in the cycle of animal generation.”64 Since the magus does not want to die but strives for immortality, his goal is to accumulate within himself a completely unshakeable spir-itual Force (referred to in alchemical language as “our” iron or steel), capable of conquering everything and even, so to speak, of “taking possession” of Life itself: not the life of some individual being, but Life as the overarching principle that stands above and comprises all individual lives.When this Life now starts to manifest during the embrace—meta-phorically speaking, of course—the magus must “surprise” her (i.e. Life) with lightning velocity. The more intense the fl uidic vertigo created by the erotic energy, the more likely it is that Life herself will appear; hence it is necessary to heighten and intensify the fl uidic vortex to its very extreme. At the same time, however, the magus must fi rmly resist the temptation of letting go: he must maintain a state of cold observa-tion and react quickly, for he must be faster than Life. The Goddess of Life becomes the Goddess of Death when she turns around, and hence the magus must spiritually withstand the tremendous fear of death that he will feel when he faces naked Life. And he must also resist physiologically, that is to say, he must not reach orgasm. How to achieve all this only experience can teach. If the magus is not up to his task, he may die from heart failure at being confronted with the horribly laughing face of Life/Death. He may also become insane or become the victim of a terrible condition of sexual possession, which can be ended only by suicide.It is hard to imagine a sexual magic more explicit or ambitious than the one taught by the UR group (the same could be said for their other magical techniques as well). Interestingly, however, no secondary litera-ture as yet exists about this very demanding set of teachings.Maria de Naglowska and the Confrérie de la Fléche d’OrMaria de Naglowska (1883–1936), already mentioned above with refer-ence to Evola, was born in St. Petersburg as a daughter of the province 64 Gruppo di Ur, Introduzione alla Magia, vol.

She was raised and educated in Smolna, a very exclusive private and aristocratic institute in her home town. She also took classes in pedagogy at the Institute of the Order of Saint Catherine. According to René Thimmy (pseudonym Maurice Magre),66 her mediumistic gifts were noted very early. Legend has it that already at a very early age she came in contact with Rasputin and/or the Khlisty sect, known for its sexual rites.67She fell in love with the violinist Moïse Hopenko and wanted to marry him. This resulted in a rift between her and her family, who rejected him because he was Jewish and did not belong to the nobility. The two lovers left Russia and settled fi rst in Berlin, then in Geneva, where they married and had three children. Her husband, an ardent Zionist, wanted to settle in Palestine, but Maria did not want to follow him. So he left her and the children around 1910 and became head of the Ron Shulamit Conservatory in Jaffa. Maria survived by teaching in private schools in Geneva, publishing a book on French grammar and another one on education, and earning an additional income as a translator while she also wrote poems.68 Somehow she followed study courses in several faculties at the University of Geneva and may even have obtained a diploma of some kind.69 She also worked as a jour-nalist, but due to her radical political ideas ended up in prison. After being released, she left Geneva for Berne and Basel but was fi nally expelled from Switzerland and found refuge in Rome around 1920 where she worked as journalist for the newspaper L’Italia until 1926.

After her death, Pluquet became a collabora-tor of the famous architect Le Corbusier. He was also instrumental in republishing some of Naglowska’s works in the 1970’s.

In the American Hotel, 15 rue Bréa, she daily received disciples or important guests. And every Wednesday she gave a public lecture in the Studio Raspail, 36 rue Vavin, where some thirty to forty persons gathered to listen to her. After that lecture, a much smaller group of followers would retire to another room for sexual ritual work (on which more below). Surprisingly perhaps, she also visited the Roman Catholic Church Notre-Dame des Champs for a period of contemplation every afternoon. In 1932, Maria de Naglowska founded the Confrérie de la Flèche d’Or (Fraternity of the Golden Arrow),70 but she was also involved in the Groupe des Polaires, which had an arithmetic oracle at its basis.71From October 15, 1930 until December 15, 1933, De Naglowska published a journal, La Flèche: eighteen issues in all, the fi rst of which contained an article written by Julius Evola.72 Indeed, according to René Thimmy,73 if she had any money at all—she did not ask fees from her 70 Alexandrian, Storia della Filosofi a Occulta, 538.71 See her article “Les Polaires” in La Flèche 13 (15 June 1932), p. 3.72 It appeared in the fi rst number (p. 3, 4) and treated the theme of “Occidental-ism.” Interestingly, Naglowska added a few lines after this article, indicating that the authors printed further on in her magazine were not disciples of her, thus implying that Evola was one. She also published a short piece (“Le message de l’étoile polaire”) in Evola’s and the Group of Ur’s magazine UR I, no. 11–12 (November–December, 1927), 328, translated into English in Julius Evola and the UR Group, Introduction to Magic, 334. Moreover she translated Evola’s dadaistic poem “La parole obscure du paysage intérieur” into French (the Italian original has disappeared).73 Thimmy, La Magie à Paris, 75 (interview with Naglowska). Thimmy/Magre was"},{"pageNumber":491,"pageContent":"468 hans thomas hakldisciples74—she invested it in her journal and the books she published. His description of Maria de Naglowska, whom for unknown reasons he disguises under the name Vera de Petrouchka, is worth repeating here, not least because it is so different from popular concepts of a “Satanist”:Somehow an atmosphere of purity, of chastity emanated from this small and quiet woman, who sat there modestly, speaking little and gesticulating even less and whose way of life seemed to be more or less ascetic. Her ordinary meals consisted of milk coffees and croissants or rolls. She practi-cally never drank alcohol and her sole vice were some cigarettes.75Her only noteworthy physiognomical characteristic were her blue eyes “blue and cold like a glacier or rather like the blades of daggers . . . light-ened by a fi re from within.” Thimmy adds that, although he may not believe in her doctrines, he has full confi dence in her sincerity and unselfi shness. An expert on the occult movements of his time, Pierre Geyraud (pseudonym of Abbé Guyader) uses very much the same words in his book Les petites églises de Paris: “I look at this woman sitting on her bed. A surprising chastity emanates from her personality. One feels that she is above sensuality, above the strange carnal rites she advocates in public . . . And she is also above any greed for money.”76 In 1936—prob-ably in the wake of a serious accident of one of her followers during the rite of hanging, which she practised in the higher degrees, and which will be described below—she left Paris very suddenly, not even designating a successor in her Confrérie. Pluquet informs us that she went to Zürich to live with her daughter Marie. There she died in her bed on April 17, 1936.To understand her sexual teachings and practices, something must fi rst be said about De Naglowska’s special brand of “Satanism.” In her mind, God is Life and Life is God. But Life can generate the world only by means of a dialectical process in which Life is constantly con-also involved with the Groupe des Polaires and wrote a very credulous introduction to their basic text book Bhotiva, Asia Mysteriosa.74 Laurent, Les sociétés secrètes érotiques, 23.75 Ibid.76 Geyraud, Les petites églises de Paris, 142–153. Thimmy’s account was published in 1934 and Geyraud’s only in 1937, and one gets the impression that Geyraud “used” various passages from Thimmy. His description of De Naglowska’s life is more or less identical, and so are many other details. This naturally does not exclude that he actu-ally met De Naglowska, who was easily approached by journalists, complete strangers or . . . catholic priests."},{"pageNumber":492,"pageContent":" the theory and practice of sexual magic 469fronted with the negation of Life. This negation is Reason, and Reason is associated by De Naglowska with Satan, who likewise constantly fi ghts God. But since God actually needs negation—Satan—as his dialectical counterpart in order to create the world, initiates who want to be part of the dialectic process have to serve Satan before they can serve God. According to De Naglowska, it was also out of the same dialectic between God and Satan that the Son, manifested in Christ, was born.77De Naglowska compared the path taken by the initiates in her order with the ascent of a symbolic mountain,78 which must be climbed under the guidance of Satan. Once they have reached the summit, they will be hanged, with their body falling down from the mountain, but they have to blindly trust Satan’s promise that they will survive the ordeal. Then, according to De Naglowska, in the exact moment of their fall, their religious service ceases to be satanic and becomes divine; and thus, after having served Satan they start serving God and understand that both these services are but one.While ascending the mountain, the initiates will undergo several temptations. De Naglowska points out that these come from God, not Satan. In the course of these temptations, they are also confronted with the female sex, whose task is to help them to achieve victory over themselves and their fears. Woman can do this through a certain attitude towards man and through special sexual rites, which are described by De Naglowska in her books.Maria de Naglowska is best known for her publication of Paschal Bev-erly Randolph’s book Magia Sexualis. Consequently, and since only very few people know about her other books, she is often regarded as merely a disciple of Randolph. But she defi nitely was not. First of all, they lived and worked in different centuries, and it is completely unknown how and through which intermediary (although s/he was probably French) De Naglowska became acquainted with Randolph’s teaching. She herself writes only that she acquired a Randolph manuscript in Paris in April, 1931, and that Magia Sexualis is based on a collection of his diffi cult-to-read handwritten notes.79 Evola seems to believe, how-ever, that De Naglowska manipulated the material and inserted ideas 77 De Naglowska, Lumière du Sexe, 19–39.78 Ibid., 37–38.79 Naglowska, “Magia Sexualis” et “La Flèche,” La Flèche 7 (15 November 1931), 3."},{"pageNumber":493,"pageContent":"470 hans thomas haklof her own.80 Saran Alexandrian, who has done extensive research on her, considers it probable that she “has entirely reworked” Randolph’s teaching, “adding a personal accent,” but—as he underlines—without deforming Randolph’s magical lore. Moreover, according to him, “her translation is certainly superior to the original, which she gave life to and put into order.”81 And De Naglowska herself declared that, “The light I am illuminated by is not the one Randolph was illuminated by”: she reproaches him for his “Hindu idolatry” and his mistaken cosmol-ogy.82 Last but not least, Maria de Naglowska’s sexual rites were, as we have seen, part of what she regarded as a Satanist religion, and this is not the case with Randolph.Her fi rst book after Magia Sexualis was a novel and shows much better what she was really after. It is called Le rite sacré de l’amour magique (The Sacred Rite of Magical Love). Its subtitle is “Aveu” (Confession), and it probably contains some autobiographical elements. The novel tells the story of a young lady, Xenophonta, who lives in a castle in the Caucasus Mountains and has been promised to Satan, referred to as a “Master of the Past.” One day, she is raped by a violent Cossack named Micha who, however, is fi nally saved by her purity. Here already we encounter one of De Naglowska’s central esoteric ideas: a genuinely pure woman who has dedicated herself to a higher Force (Satan) and does not want anything for herself can save even the most violent man and turn him into a sage. And she can do this by satisfying his carnal desires. In fact, not Micha but Xenophonta was guilty of the rape: she had tempted him by her secretive behaviour, and the only way for her to change Micha was by opening up to him completely. De Naglowska also retells the story of Adam eating from the apple—a sexual metaphor—that brought death to mankind: “And in order not to obey anymore to the voice of the cave of woman [i.e., her sexual attractiveness] he [Adam] put a seal onto it: the fi rst garment [i.e. the fi g leaf ]. He spoke to Eve: ‘You will hide yourself from me, because you are the temptation.’ ”83 The novel has an appendix about De Naglowska’s doctrine of the 80 Evola “Prefazione,” 8, 9. Evola was the Italian translator of Magia Sexualis.81 Alexandrian, “Maria de Naglowska et le satanisme feminin,” 190, 191.82 De Naglowska, “Satanisme masculin, satanisme féminin,” La Flèche no. 16, 20–21.83 De Naglowska, Le rite sacré de l’amour magique, 32. A more detailed discussion of this novel specially in regard to the mysterious cosmic AUM clock described therein can be found in Fincati “Postfazione” in his Italian translation of this novel.

That is the task to which the “Priestesses of Love” dedicate themselves. They must be “virgins” in the special sense of not knowing normal sexual pleasure:. . . pleasure belongs to the Sun and is the characteristic of the Sun, whereas the mysterious mountain of woman [ De Naglowska probably refers to the Mons Veneris] is essentially lunar and, like the moon, must remain cold and mute. In the act of love the female vibrations must procure her inner happiness and not a local pleasure, because pleasure belongs to man and not to woman. Human generations start to decline when men devi-ate from this truth, teaching women what they should never know: local pleasure. Women rapidly grow old when they partake of this forbidden fruit, and the blood of their children impoverishes.84Therefore the priestess of love must feel a true vocation of giving herself to every man with the same physical ardour. She need not love him or even like him, but must see and joyfully adore in him the Perfect Man of future eras. Through her purity and spirituality, woman must educate man, releasing him from all his perversities and making him stronger, healthier, and morally just. If she succeeds in this, she renders a service to the whole of mankind.It appears that Maria de Naglowska actually put this in practice during the rites of her Confrérie, in at least one of which her own body served as the altar. Several of these rites are known and have even been described by outsiders. They were all designed to impress the onlookers by their splendor, ceremonial setting (including music), and candor. Thimmy writes, however, that when he was present at such an occasion, the atmosphere among the audience was anything but serious. People there were drinking champagne, and their minds were busy with “profane—just too profane” thoughts.8584 De Naglowska, Le Mystère de la pendaison, 84.85 Thimmy, La Magie à Paris, 87."},{"pageNumber":495,"pageContent":"472 hans thomas haklOne example was the Rite of the Compasses. A man or woman stood upright, and a naked priestess lay down at his or her feet at a right angle so that they looked like an open pair of compasses. The members of the group of onlookers took each other’s hands in order to form a magical chain. By means of group concentration, the members of this chain then had to generate as much energy as possible. Next, the priestess “drew” that energy towards herself, reinforcing it with the energy generated between her and her standing partner. By focusing it, a fi reball of energy was supposed to appear in her hands.86 In this rite, the energy was generated only by the confi guration and concentration of the participants, apparently without the help of sexual intercourse.The most famous rite, however, was the Rite of Hanging,87 by which a second-degree member, a so called Chasseur Affranchi (Liberated Hunter), became a Guerrier Invincible (Invincible Warrior).88 To prepare for this rite, a man fi rst had to conquer the fear associated with it, and for this he had three, seven, or at the utmost twelve years time. If he still did not want to undergo the initiation at that point, he had to leave the order, and a special rite had to be performed.89 In a symbolical act, “his lamp” in the Temple was ceremoniously extinguished, and the priestess whose task it had been to assist him during the period of preparation was henceforth considered a “widow.” As punishment for her failure to “purify” him and give him strength and confi dence, she was to be taken to the so-called Pavilion of Widows, which she would be allowed to leave only in the darkest hours of night, without moonlight. All this remained theoretical, as no such pavilion existed, and it seems that the Confrérie did not even have a temple of its own. Still, these descriptions show the spirit of the underlying philosophy.The Rite of Hanging itself was open only to the holders of the high-est degrees, since the energy generated thereby was considered extremely dangerous for the non-initiated. It consisted of a ritual hanging, with the legs of the hanged man (apparently the initiation was open only to males) actually dangling in the air. Just before the ceremony would lead to a fatal end, the rope was cut and the man was put down on 86 See ibid., 85–86, for a description of the rite. 87 De Naglowska, Le Mystère de la pendaison, 103–121.88 The fi rst degree was called Balayeur de la Cour (Sweeper of the Court), because the holders of this degree were busy sweeping away their defi ciencies.89 It is very improbable that any such ceremony ever took place, especially in view of the fact that Maria de Naglowska had lived in Paris for only six years."},{"pageNumber":496,"pageContent":" the theory and practice of sexual magic 473a bed. “His” priestess would lie down next to him, and after he had recovered, ritual intercourse would take place. After this initiation the man had become an “Invincible Warrior,” because he could no longer be tempted by a woman: during his hanging, he had experienced such an extreme lust90 and such incredible bliss that everything else would have become shallow. According to the doctrine, Satan himself caused this bliss by entering from above into the body of the candidate at the moment he lost his foothold and fell down. Clearly, we are dealing with an extreme form of a death-and-rebirth initiation: one had to die in this profane world to be reborn in another one. The candidate was to be literally confronted with the total and eternal void, which would inevitably change his perspective forever.Maria de Naglowska regarded her so-called Messe d’Or (Golden Mass) as the most important rite of all. During it, seven male offi cials were to make love to three priestesses, in a beautiful ceremonial setting and in public. The requirement, however, for all of them was to be totally purifi ed of vanity and personal appetites. This rite was never actually performed and only a preliminary rite preparing for the Golden Mass is on record.Another point in De Naglowska’s doctrine that well illustrates her intentions is raised in her article “Les mystères cardinaux et la Messe d’Or,” where she writes that the highest sacrament of the union between man and woman is not marriage but divorce. She means a divorce out of love, not out of hatred or disappointment. Its aim is occult perfection. Such a divorce will only be possible when man in the coming era will be redeemed from his “primordial instinct” by a successful marriage. “Stronger than before, because more upright and better centered in himself,” man will voluntarily renounce the pleasure he has known, and leave his home as a mystical hero to pursue higher goals.We do not know whether Maria de Naglowska created all her doc-trines and rites entirely by herself, or was infl uenced by other sources. One of them could have been (Sar) Joséph(in) Péladan (1859–1918), whose erotic magic may have infl uenced her.91 B. Anel-Kham (pseudo-nym of Henri Meslin, died 1948 and member of the Groupe des Polaires) 90 It appears that in our own time, hundreds of deaths by accident occur all over the world each year, as a result of various forms of sexually-orientated strangulation techniques.91 Cf. the discussion of Péladan’s ideas on erotism in Bertholet, La pensée et les secrets du Sâr Joséphin Péladan, vol. II, “La science de l’Amour,” 11–101."},{"pageNumber":497,"pageContent":"474 hans thomas haklsees in De Naglowska’s Confrérie a revival of the Cénacle d’Astarté, a French occult group founded around 1920 by what he calls “adepts of the Divine Woman, third hypostasis of the manifested Absolute”.92 Most probably she was also in direct contact with Petr Kohout (pen name: Pierre de Lasenic), who lived in Paris during this time: in a series of occult writings called Dragon Vert (Green Dragon), which seems to have been related to La Flèche, she announced the publication of his book Les Rituels des Sociétés de Magie Sexuelle (The Rituals of the Societies of Sexual Magic).93 This Kohout is said to have been the most skilled prac-tical magician of the renowned Czech esoteric group Universalia, and to have been related to an otherwise unknown French magical order called S.E.S. (Société Egyptienne Secrète).94 And fi nally there is the rumour, already mentioned, that De Naglowska was initiated by Rasputin or by the Russian sect of the Khlysties, or even by Hasidic circles.95As a postscript to the above, it may be worthwhile to quote a pas-sage from Mircea Eliade’s diary, May 27, 1948, in which he relates something that happened to him after lecturing at the École Pratique des Hautes Études (Sorbonne) in Paris:A lady approaches with a package in her hand: it contains the works of Marie de Naglowska on sexuality, La Lumière du sexe, Le Mystère de la pendaison, and a collection of the magazine La Flèche. The lady begs me insistently to take great care with them, to hide them in my closet under lock and key, because they are “very dangerous initiatory texts,” etc. Leaf-ing through them at home, I am depressed by their absolute vacuity.96ConclusionIn this chapter, we have set ourselves the goal of presenting a factual account of four quite different types of practice in the domain of sexual magic. It should be stressed again, however, that while this overview is based on original source texts, this does not mean that all the ritu-als described have actually been put into practice.

Indeed, the subject of sexual magic may evoke questions of many kinds, but any attempt to address them will have to start with the textual sources themselves, which are as yet almost unknown except among restricted circles of specialists and practitioners, and a fi rst impression of which it has been our goal to present.BibliographyAbraxa (ps.

KripalTyger Tyger, burning brightIn the forest of the night;What immortal hand or eye.Could frame thy fearful symmetry?. . . . .When the stars threw down their spearsAnd water’d heaven with their tears:Did he smile his work to see?Did he who made the Lamb make thee?William Blake, “The Tyger”The multiple weavings of eroticism and esotericism within the history of the Esalen Institute in Big Sur, California—the mother of the Ameri-can human potential movement founded in 1962 by Michael Murphy (1930) and Richard Price (1930–1985)—is a vast half-century tapestry whose multiple patterns, colors, and textures I have woven elsewhere in some detail.1 The present essay is not a summary or replication of that historiographic project. Rather it is a further theorization of and refl ection on the results of it. It is a “standing back” to see one, and only one, of the fi nal weaves or gestalts, in this case an erotic one.Admittedly, the colorful complexities are bright, but also more than a little daunting. There are, after all, many ways into the erotic here, far too many for as brief an essay as this. Anecdotal humor is perhaps the quickest way into the subject, like the scene I witnessed in the Big House in the spring of 2003, when the psychical researcher Marilyn Schlitz and founder Michael Murphy got into an animated discussion about the strange phenomenon of “bodily elongation” during a research 1 Kripal, Esalen: America and the Religion of No Religion. Very small portions of the present essay appeared originally in this text and are used here with permission. The section on John Heider also appears, in a different and much expanded form, in “From Paradise to Paradox: The Psychospiritual Journey of John Heider.”"},{"pageNumber":503,"pageContent":"480 jeffrey j. kripalsymposium. Murphy asked Schlitz if she had any material on bodily elongation in her archives. “No,” she quipped back, “that would be in the porn section.” Bodily elongation aside for a moment, there are certainly other, less anecdotal, more theoretical ways into the eros of Esalen. We could dwell, for example, on the eros of the founders, the eros of Big Sur literary culture, the eros of the baths, or the eros of Esalen’s contemplative massage tradition.Richard Price grew up in a Jewish family posing as Episcopalians outside of Chicago in the 40s in the painful emotional shadows of a beloved twin brother who had died at the age of three (from a burst appendix), with a too distant father who retreated into his work, partly perhaps to avoid the pain of the loss of his infant, and with a control-ling, sexually repressive mother Price came to more or less hate. Price would fi nd a new life in California, that is, as far from Chicago as he could get, in Buddhism and Taoism, that is, as far from his mother’s social-climbing Christianity as he could get, and in a form of gestalt psy-chology in which he could fi nd some measure of peace and healing.He would need the latter, especially after his own mystical awaken-ing erupted within a psychotic state in 1956 that resulted in months of hospitalization and what amounted to psychiatric torture with shock therapy, drugs, and more drugs. It was during one of these psychotic breakthroughs that Price’s sexuality awoke alongside and within his spiritual life and a whole series of psychical experiences, including past-life memories in which he remembered himself as what he thought was a monk, a bodily superpower involving a kind of invisible “energy fi eld” around his body, and a spontaneous healing of an old sports back injury. On the sexual side, Price spoke of “a kind of early shut-up in my genitals” that lasted until these openings. He thus noted that he did not masturbate until he was twenty-two. But the sexual shut-up had been opened now, like his spirit, like his Buddhism, like his life.2 The mystical, the erotic, and the psychical all appeared together in Price’s breakdown that was also a breakthrough.Unlike Price, Michael Murphy grew up in what was by all accounts a happy family life. He came to his mystical life in college via the reading of Sri Aurobindo, the Indian metaphysician who encouraged a form of traditional sannyasa or celibate “renunciation” as an alchemical tech-2 I am relying here on Erikson, “A Psychobiography of Richard Price: Co-founder of Esalen Institute.”"},{"pageNumber":504,"pageContent":" the roar of awakening 481nique toward a kind of evolutionary advance and spiritual mutation. Murphy lived in Aurobindo’s ashram for a year and a half in the mid 50’s and took a vow of celibacy, which he did not break until the fi rst few months of Esalen’s founding, on the night of October 25, 1962, to be precise. The sex almost killed him. Literally. The day after his breaking of the vow, the couple’s car was struck, head-on, by a drunk driver (who, oddly enough, was looking for Murphy) as they drove down Highway 1 on the cliffs of Big Sur. They were on their way to Esalen, where Murphy was to introduce Gerald Heard, a homoerotic celibate author who helped inspire the founding of the institute. Murphy could not help but see connections between the night of sex and the car accident. For him, the whole event partook of the synchronistic, of some deeper weaving of pattern and meaning that would take him years to understand and come to terms with.We need not begin with the founders, though. After all, the erotic well preceded both men at Big Sur through the place’s literary his-tory. There was, for example, the powerful literary presence of Henry Miller, who wrote banned novels many considered pure pornography (more elongating bodies) and who described a kind of automatic writ-ing practice and a series of synchronistic signs he claimed to see in the landscape and magical events of Big Sur. For Miller anyway, these events were not simply unusual or uncanny. They were also noetic. They carried altered forms of knowledge. They produced literature. There was also the foundational intellectual presence of Wilhelm Reich, whose “orgone” everyone in Big Sur was reading about (and probably practicing) at this time. And then there were the Beat poets, like Jack Kerouac, who wrote about both Big Sur and Buddhism and a whole lot of sex and alcohol, which fi nally really did kill him. Hence the eros of both Big Sur and Esalen would have a distinct literary infl ection. It was not just sex. It was sex as literature. It was sexuality as textuality.Then, of course, there are the famous baths of Esalen. These are located on the southern tip of the property. The voyeuristically inclined can easily see the baths from the cliff porch of the lodge, although the bodies in the waters and on the rooftop massage area are mere dots at this distance and the telescopes perched on the walkway half-way down will not swing south toward the baths (I’ve tried). They are apparently for looking at ocean horizons, waves, and whales, not watery human beings. The telescopes and binoculars of the occasional fi shing boat are another matter. Murphy likes to tell stories about individuals in the baths who used binoculars to peer out on to fi shing boats on the"},{"pageNumber":505,"pageContent":"482 jeffrey j. kripalhorizon only to see the fi shermen peering back at them with their own magnifying scopes. Much more dramatic, in the 1970s military planes and helicopters would fl y very, very low, presumably to see the nude bodies stretched out below. There are many perspectives from which to see and to be seen.Signifi cantly, one enters the baths as one enters a sacred grotto.3 A small ritual fountain bubbles before some Japanese tile art as one walks down the steps. To one’s immediate left sits the bathroom and towel area. A bit further in and down one turns right for one of the two changing rooms and a rather spectacular shower room, a spa-cious watery den open toward the changing room and separated from the ocean by an immense sliding glass wall and a fi fty-foot drop to the rocks below. As one enters this changing room and looks toward the shower room, one is often met with the shapes and curves of bathing men and women, their soapy wet forms silhouetted against the ocean horizon and sky.There are two basic bathing areas: a turn right down the stairs takes one into the northern “quiet” side for those who wish to talk. A turn left takes one into the southern “silent” side for those who prefer con-templation and solitude over curious or chatty company. Signifi cantly, there is no such designation for gender (although the earlier Esalen baths were in fact gender segregated, these “genders”—“Women’s Side” and “Men’s Side”—in practice referred only to “quiet” or “mas-sage area” and “conversational,” respectively). Both founders originally opposed this lack of gender segregation, but the residents and visitors ignored their opposition into sheer irrelevance. The quiet side sports three traditional bathtubs that can be quickly fi lled with hot or cold water (or both in consecutive order for the really brave) and four baths of various sizes, two under the roof but open to the ocean and two perched outdoors. The silent side contains two much larger square cement baths that are separated from the ocean by a moving glass wall and a private room for massage sessions. A second and much larger massage area and a handicap-accessible bath occupies the roof of the structure, where wild grasses grow.3 On a related note, according to Richard Tarnas, the anthropologist Gregory Bateson, who lived on the grounds toward the very end of his life, once defended the baths with the rhyming phrase, “Nudity is not ludity.”"},{"pageNumber":506,"pageContent":" the roar of awakening 483There is no doubt that one of the most important bodily practices at Esalen is the social practice of mixed nude bathing in the hot tubs on the very edge of the property. One simply cannot visit the grounds without coming away with the distinct impression that those baths bubble at the very center of whatever meanings Esalen might have for its many visitors. Sociologically speaking, this makes very good sense, for the practice of mixed nude bathing re-enacts in a particularly dra-matic and effective way the radical democracy and erotic mysticism of the place within a graceful transgressive movement from separated, clothed, hyper-socialized individuals to a single hot tub of naked men and women sharing conversation as they listen to the crashing ocean just beneath them and ponder the seemingly infi nite night sky above them. There is little here to remind one of social distinction and individual separation and much to deny them. Indeed, both one’s company and the universe itself seem to mock such temporary illusions as so many cheap ridiculous clothes.4Also signifi cant here is the practice of contemplative massage, which is localized at the same baths but also performed elsewhere on the grounds, particularly around the swimming pool up near the lodge in the front lawn. The language of training is vaguely erotic. The prac-titioner does not have a “patient” or “client,” for example. She or he (more commonly she) has a “partner.” Historically (and still today on occasion), moreover, the practitioner might choose to massage in the nude. Traditional Esalen massage, however, works its magic precisely through a very careful balance between the obvious and acknowledged sensuality of close and caring physical touch and a keen professional sense of respect for the partner and his or her own comfort level.Generally, for example, a session begins with a conversation between the practitioner and the partner so that the massage giver can both get a sense of the partner’s needs, wishes, and concerns and receive the latter’s implicit permission to touch. One is asked to show up at the baths a bit of ahead of time. Most will take a shower or sit in the baths for a few minutes to relax and prepare mentally. This is, after all, not simply 4 The fi nest refl ections on the Esalen baths that I have encountered are Keith Thompson’s “The Hot Springs” (The Esalen Catalog [ January–June 1991]: 4–9), a beautifully written study of the baths via (fi ctional?) conversations Thompson had in the baths one night with a geologist, a professor of ancient history, a theologian, a physician, and a Big Sur local. For the details of massage techniques, I am relying here on “Esalen Massage” (Looking Glass Home Video, 1997)."},{"pageNumber":507,"pageContent":"484 jeffrey j. kripala physical experience. It is also, potentially at least, a contemplative experience involving the whole person. After a brief conversation, the massage begins. The partner is nude, except for a towel carefully placed between the buttocks during the fi rst half or on the genitals during the second (the session is roughly divided into two sections, that is, lying on the stomach and lying on the back). Using cold-pressed natural oils that are warmed up by rubbing the hands together, the massage giver begins, perhaps with the toes or on the scalp and works from segment to segment of the body, always being careful to integrate the segment with the rest of the body at the end through long slow massage strokes that physically reunite the body again.As he or she moves from limb to limb, section to section, the massage giver uses a whole variety of techniques, gently rotating or rocking a joint, stretching a muscle, kneading a sole with a thumb or fi nger, mas-saging a spinal line (never the spine itself ) with the back of a forearm, massaging an ear or a scalp section, as he or she looks for tension points and begins to establish trust. The combination of a total body mas-sage, the sensuality of an oily touch and rub, the presence of another human being giving such nurturance and care, and the hypnotic roll of the waves surrounding the entire experience all have their effect. The massage giver pauses, integrates the experience within a contem-plative moment, and quietly departs the room or space. The partner, assuming he or she is awake, is free to rest there for a few minutes or depart immediately.It is diffi cult, if not impossible, to capture this all in words, but some have tried. Perhaps none have been quite as eloquent as the Harvard theologian Harvey Cox, who recounted in some detail his own visions and thoughts while enjoying a hot bath and receiving a group mas-sage by candlelight at Esalen in the late 60s. Cox’s refl ections are signifi cant, both because of his obvious theological training, but also because they can act as an effective foreshadowing of my thesis on the Tantric transmission.As Cox was massaged, he found himself watching the candles and his own theological imagination. More specifi cally, the candles all merged in his vision and he caught a glimpse of Teilhard de Chardin’s Omega Point, “a supra-personal future in which individuals become joyous corpuscles in a more inclusive organism.” Then he felt himself slipping back into his own childhood sensuality and watched as the erotic experience of the baths and massage morphed into a certain metaphysical intuition:"},{"pageNumber":508,"pageContent":" the roar of awakening 485Time, I have no idea how much, passed. Now all the candles were one fl ame and all the fi ngers were on one great hand. The combination of water, chanting, body dissociation, and massage was moving me beyond a pleasantly sensuous swoon into something closer to what I could only imagine was either a fanciful reverie or a mystical trance. I could feel the hydrogen and oxygen molecules of the water seeping into the amino acids and carbohydrates and bone cells and nerve endings of my body. The hands touching me became mine, and my own hands slid off my wrists to fuse with the dampness in and around me. Again the vision faded. Now I felt something I had read about many times before but never understood: the underlying unity of Brahman and Atman, the oneness of self, other, and All. . . . We are all in some ways one with the water, the sky, the air, each other, and in the sulfur baths the reality of a collective self seems a little less bizarre than it does in the everyday world.5I know of few recorded experiences that capture as many of the religious resonances of Esalen as this one. The psychological, vaguely psychoanalytic sophistication of the narrative (languages of regression and dissociation), a theology of evolution, a kind of animan siddhi or psychic gaze into the microscopic movements of the enlightened body (hydrogen and oxygen molecules, bone cells and nerve endings), the Indian identity of brahman and atman, and a kind of ecological vision of cosmic unity—these are all classical Esalen tropes.But there is more, as Cox then goes on and, as if to affi rm my own present thesis about Esalen, refl ects back on his experience by compar-ing it to examples of something similar that he knew from the history of religions, in particular the Hindu stories of Krishna making love to the milkmaids and the Tantric rituals of Hinduism and Tibetan Bud-dhism. Signifi cantly, he could only think of a single Western example that spoke to his Esalen experience, a line from the Song of Songs.But the eros of the founders, of the literature, of the baths, and of Esalen massage are only the beginning. There was also a fi fteenth-century Dutch painting, Hieronymus Bosch’s “The Garden of Earthly Delights,” whose bizarre erotic scenes were much beloved and com-mented on by the Big Sur fi gures of Henry Miller, Michael Murphy, and Gerald Heard. Miller saw the Dutch masterpiece as a utopian image 5 In Alexander, American Personal Religious Accounts, 1600–1980: Toward an Inner History of America’s Faith, 428–429. I am indebted to Eugene Taylor for pointing this passage out to me.

Murphy has hung it in his homes for forty years as an apt portrayal of Esalen’s altered history of blissful heavens and moral hells. Heard suggested it could be read as an esoteric medieval code for kundalini-like intuitions and sublimated spiritualized sex.Then there was the hyper-eroticism of some of the psychedelic sacraments, a kind of super-sexuality elicited by the substances that was reported by many and famously exaggerated by Timothy Leary in an outrageous Playboy interview mischievously titled “She Comes in Colors.”6 Much like Paschal Beverly Randolph in the nineteenth cen-tury (see the essay of Deveney above), many of the early Esalen actors saw in these extraordinary substances an important key, if not the key, to the history of religions: psychotropic agents had again become, in Randolph’s nineteenth-century words now, the secret of “the Alche-mists, Hermetists, Illuminati, and mystic brethren of all ages.”7 Here too we might place the archetypal linking of sex, death, and spirit in the LSD and holotropic breathwork writings of Stanislav and Chris-tina Grof. Stanislav wrote volumes on the eroticism of mystical states, particularly as these states were said to organize themselves around Grof ’s hypothesized “Basic Perinatal Matrices” (BPM) or archetypal stages of birth and their energies, some of which were distinctly sexual. Christina, moreover, came to her vocation, literally, through her womb and a series of mystical currents and altered states of consciousness experienced during childbirth that she would later read as expressions of an awakening kundalini, that is, as “Tantric.”All of this, of course, can also be read as so many moments in the surrounding “sexual revolution” of the 60s (a term fi rst coined by Wilhelm Reich), in which Esalen’s famous baths and general culture of sensuality played a small but real supporting role. Signifi cant here too was the Summer of Love of 1967 in San Francisco, which spilled out and down into Big Sur and Esalen, more or less overrunning the property with stoned hippies.6 This interview was later anthologized in Timothy Leary, The Politics of Ecstasy, chapter 7.7 Quoted and discussed above in Deveney, “Paschal Beverly Randolph and Sexual Magic.”"},{"pageNumber":510,"pageContent":" the roar of awakening 487On “Mysticism” and “Western Esotericism”All of this is relevant to our topic. But how might we best contextualize such a modern eros within the history of western esotericism? Clearly, we are on similar but also very different ground here than we were with those historical contexts explored in our earlier chapter essays. To take just a few examples, if Thomas Lake Harris’s remarkable sexual mysticism owed as little to Asia as he knew about Buddhism (see the Versluis essay above), and if Aleister Crowley’s consistent references to Tantra were not backed up by a signifi cant historical knowledge of the subject (see the essay of Urban above), the same can not be said about many of the thinkers and actors of Esalen’s history. Clearly, such fi gures were transforming these traditions, but they were doing so with much more textual, ethnographic, even initiatory knowledge than their nineteenth- and early twentieth-century predecessors. They did not just fantasize about India. They traveled and lived there. They did not just read Hindu, Buddhist, and Taoist scriptures. They read widely in western scholarship on these traditions (particularly Woodroffe, Conze, and Eliade) and studied and meditated with Hindu, Buddhist, and Taoist teachers both in the States and in Asia. And very much like Paschal Beverly Randolph and very much unlike the bookish anti-quarians of Deveney’s essay, they insisted on grounding their reading and knowledge in transformative practice and empirically experienced altered states of consciousness and energy, much of which came from literally thousands of hours of disciplined meditation and practice. To put it a bit differently, many of these individuals were not the dilet-tantes that they are often assumed to be, and their translations of the Asian traditions, however unusual or unprecedented, should be taken as seriously by the historian as those transformations of, say, Buddhism that occurred with the Tibetan assimilations of the eighth century or of the Chinese translations at the beginning of the common era. If the Doctrine of the Elders (Theravada) can become the Great Vehicle (Mahayana) and even the Thunderbolt Vehicle (Vajrayana), why can’t, say, Bengali Shakta Tantra become English California Tantra? Why honor the former transformations and dismiss the latter?In terms of our present subject, it must be acknowledged up front that the category of western esotericism is a recent scholarly category and so does not occur as such in this twentieth-century history of Esalen. Many of the fi gures and traditions captured by the expression, of course, were important to Esalen, but nowhere in that history was"},{"pageNumber":511,"pageContent":"488 jeffrey j. kripalthe concept of western esotericism advanced or offered as such. The closest we get here is the related western category of “mysticism,” which is in fact omnipresent in Esalen’s history. Indeed, the category of mysticism dates back to the very fi rst brochure, where it appears as “drug-induced mysticism,” the topic of the fourth featured seminar, which took place on November 3–4, 1962. Signifi cantly, the term came with some rather severe challenges to the more traditional and more orthodox concept of “religion”:There seems to be no question in anyone’s mind who has experienced it, that the so-called “psychedelic” drugs, such as LSD and mescalin, produce a kind of mystical experience. The question that worries many people is, “Is the drug-induced mysticism religion?” It is altogether possible that drug-induced mystical experiences will force us to study and revise all of our previous defi nitions of religion. Those who are interested in expand-ing the boundaries of their own religious faith should be interested in a discussion of these questions.8The category of mysticism, of course, had a long prehistory before this Esalen seminar. Although the category had clear and important precedents that reached back as far as eighteenth-century England (where, in its very fi rst English appearance, it already signaled a kind of sublimated feminine eroticism—mysticism, in other words, has signaled a type of sexual alchemy from the very beginning),9 seventeenth-century France,10 and—at least as an adjective—the ancient Mediterranean world,11 the noun as it has been commonly used at Esalen made its fi rst defi nitive appearance in June of 1902, when the Harvard psychologist and American philosopher William James published his Gifford Lectures, The Varieties of Religious Experience.12In perfect line with the experiential and individualist convictions of Esalen, this same text was written partly out of James’ own mystical experience while hiking in the Adirondacks shortly before the Gifford Lectures, his spiritual experiments with nitrous oxide (which produced one of the most oft-quoted passages of the entire book), his close friendship with the British psychical researcher F.W.H. Myers, and his 8 First quadrifold brochure, Fall 1962. 9 Schmidt, “The Making of Modern Mysticism,” 273–302.10 De Certeau, “Mysticism.”11 Bouyer, “Mysticism: An Essay on the History of the Word,” 42–55.12 I am indebted to Don Cupitt for this striking thesis. See his Mysticism and Modernity."},{"pageNumber":512,"pageContent":" the roar of awakening 489own psychical researches with the Boston psychic Mrs. Piper.13 James approached all of these experiences with great philosophical serious-ness and what he himself called a “radical empiricism,” that is, an empiricism that refused to ignore anomalous psychological events simply because they could not be fi t into the reigning scientism of the day. In other words, Mrs. Pipers’ telepathic abilities and James’ psychoactive experience of consciousness as multiple were as much a part of the empirical world for James as any daily emotion or sensory perception, and any adequate psychological model had to struggle with all of these empirical psychological events, not just the ones that wouldn’t upset the apple-carts of strict materialism and determinism.Put more baldly, then, “mysticism,” rather than being an ancient category easily found in all religions in all times, derives its Esalen salience from a mystically inclined Harvard professor and psychical researcher speaking in Scotland whose published lectures have since been read by countless other scholars of religion and practitioners (including those at Esalen) and subsequently developed into a coher-ent, often quite popular idea we now call “mysticism.” Little wonder, then, that James had a major impact on Esalen’s earliest inspirations, primarily through the reading and writing of Michael Murphy, who considers both James’s radical empiricism and his openness to the mys-tical and the psychical to be among the cornerstones of the Institute’s intellectual foundations.14What is perhaps most interesting, though, and what is certainly worth explaining, is how Esalen has helped to redefi ne, with a whole host of other countercultural and New Age groups, what it means to be a “mystical” movement in the modern world. No one has seen this fundamental shift of the mystical more clearly than Wouter Hane-graaff. In his study of the New Age movement, Hanegraaff has argued that the modern New Age can best be seen as a form of “Western esotericism in the mirror of secular thought.”15 Although Esalen has always been uncomfortable with the designation “New Age” (hence the expression has been consciously and systematically kept out of its 13 Murphy and Ballou, eds., William James on Psychical Research.14 These last three paragraphs fi rst appeared in a different context in my “Com-parative Mystics: Scholars as Gnostic Diplomats,” in Perl, ed., Talking Peace with Gods, Symposium on the Reconciliation of Worldviews, Part 1, Common Knowledge.15 Hanegraaff, New Age Religion and Western Culture."},{"pageNumber":513,"pageContent":"490 jeffrey j. kripalcatalogs), Hanegraaff ’s observation holds true for much, if not most, of Esalen’s history.With such a model, we can see that modern mystical movements like Esalen are not at all the same as their premodern precursors, however much they might draw on these for some of their central ideas and practices. These modern movements, after all, have passed through the secular revolutions of science and democracy, and so they order themselves in fundamentally different ways. They understand something of Freud’s unconscious, and so they easily and quickly psychologize their spiritualities, that is, they recognize that their religious experi-ences are fundamentally related to unconscious dynamic forces and the emotional-sexual patterns of their lives. They embrace the basic political principles of secularism, and so they understand religion to be a matter of private choice and never something to be imposed by state, church, or religious authority “from outside” or “from above.” They have embraced modern science, whether or not they fully under-stand it, and so they turn to evolution and quantum physics for some of their most important mystical metaphors and ideas. They live in a capitalist economy, and so they market their spiritual productions as easily and as effectively as others sell computers or professional services. And, perhaps most importantly, they assume the individualist values of modern democracy, and so they reject many of the standard insti-tutional features of esotericism, particularly the elaborate hierarchies and attending secret initiations that have usually defi ned and controlled these movements as top-down institutions in the past.In effect, although the form or content of Esalen’s mystical thought may indeed be remarkably similar to previous forms, almost all of the rules about how this form of thought can be expressed socially and experienced psychologically have changed, and changed radically.16 Put simply, if Esalen expresses a kind of Jamesian mysticism, we must immediately add that this is very much a modern and American democratic mysticism as well, one that seeks, as William Everson imagined, to locate divinization in the here and now and in the individual, not in some 16 And this sets esoteric movements like Esalen or the New Age in opposition to the Traditionalism of thinkers like René Guenon, Julius Evola, Ananda Coomaraswamy, Fritjof Schuon, Seyyed Hussein Nasr, and Huston Smith, each of whom rejects (to very different degrees) modernity and/or modern science.

Interestingly, despite his rejection of Esalen’s evolutionary mysticism, Smith has played a consistent role in Esalen’s history."},{"pageNumber":514,"pageContent":" the roar of awakening 491distant sacred past or through yet another hierarchal system of media-tion, authority, and deferral. “Now,” Everson wrote, “it is apparent that whereas hierarchical cultures tend to structure-out the vertical element against the unremitting deferral of apotheosis, democracies constantly seek to precipitate apotheosis in the here and now.”17There is a fi nal point to make here. Even though the language of “mystical experience” and “mysticism” were indigenous terms at early Esalen, a case could easily be made that Esalen’s intellectual history is better rendered as a form of “western esotericism in the mirror of Asian thought.” Kocku von Stuckrad has recently distinguished the categories of mysticism and esotericism with the suggestion that the former generally involves some sort of union with a deity or with nature, whereas the latter is distinguished by its consistent claim to some form of “absolute knowledge” or “total hermeneutic.”18 Put a bit differently, esotericism for von Stuckrad is fundamentally a noetic phenomenon—it grants knowledge, even absolute knowledge, about the structure of the cosmos or soul.19Rendered thus, the inspirations and symposia of early Esalen were primarily forms of esoteric, not mystical, thought, for they showed little (really no) interest in a particular deity or religious tradition and gave every suggestion that what they were after was a new form of integral knowledge, a new global gnosis uniting both East and West and mysti-cism (the subjective soul) and science (the objective cosmos). It is no accident, then, that the very fi rst brochures featured on their covers both an infi nitesimal calculation equation from Bertrand Russell and a contemplative Asian lotus. The message was clear: the altered states of contemplation and mystical experience carry real knowledge, and this real knowledge can be related to more exoteric forms of knowledge, including and especially modern science. In von Stuckrad’s terms, this was no wish for union with a deity. This was a claim to, or at least a hope for, a total hermeneutic.17 Everson, Archetype West: The Pacifi c Coast as a Literary Region, 10.18 Von Stuckrad, “Esotericism and Mysticism: What Is the Difference?” 19 It must be pointed out here that the Jamesian category of mysticism also carries this sense. James, after all, stressed the noetic quality of mystical experience. No doubt, we are dealing with a matter of degrees and overlapping categories here. Western esotericism as defi ned by von Stuckrad gives primacy to the noetic, whereas for James it is only one of four characteristics."},{"pageNumber":515,"pageContent":"492 jeffrey j. kripalThe Western Transmission of “Tantra”And no hope for a total hermeneutic, not at least at Esalen, can exclude the body and sexuality. Which takes us back to Harvey Cox’s theological “free associations” involving Teilhard de Chardin’s evolutionary vision and the sexual practices of Hindu and Buddhist Tantrism while being massaged down by the Esalen baths. Such metaphysical associations were hardly accidental. Indeed, I would suggest that they were quite prescient, particularly in their linking of the mystical, the erotic, and Tantric India at Esalen. I want to turn now to that specifi c moment of Cox’s massage and expand it into a much broader and developed thesis about the mutual awakening of sexual and spiritual desire at Esalen. That is, I want to focus on the imagining and experience of “Tantra” within the eros of Esalen. As a way into this particular lineage, I will begin (and end) with a single parable and its intriguing transformations through Indian and American culture.The parable in question is a story that the Bengali saint Ramakrishna used to tell. It fi rst entered American culture through the lectures of his missionary disciple, Swami Vivekananda, who told it again at the World’s Parliament of Religions in Chicago in 1893. A little over a half-century later, it was developed further through the editing and ghost-writing of Joseph Campbell (a major Esalen fi gure), who chose to open Heinrich Zimmer’s Philosophies of India (1951) with a chapter entitled “The Roar of Awakening” based on the same parable. Exiled from Germany for his Jewish wife, that is, for his love of a woman, Zimmer had fl ed to New York, where he taught Campbell at Columbia just before he suddenly died of pneumonia in 1943.I want to focus on this parable, particularly as it is refashioned by Zimmer and Campbell, for three reasons. First, because it resurfaces in American culture in 1951, just before the two future founders of Esalen will undergo their own “roars of awakening” within a reading experience and psychotic illumination, respectively, in 1956. Second, because Campbell himself will later play an important role in Esalen’s culture and its specifi c re-imagining and translation of “Tantra.” And third, and primarily, because I think the parable’s Bengali to American history captures something important about the ways that the catego-ries of eros, experience, and the self were understood and expressed at Esalen’s founding and later history."},{"pageNumber":516,"pageContent":" the roar of awakening 493The parable goes like this in one of its Bengali versions:A tigress once stalked a fl ock of goats. But she was pregnant, and so when she jumped, the cub was born and the tigress died. As the cub was raised by the goats, he began to eat grass with them and “bhyaah, bhyaah” like a goat. Soon this cub grew very large. One day, another tiger pounced into the fl ock of goats. He was speechless before what he saw, namely, a tiger eating grass, bleating, and being raised as a goat. Then the elder tiger grabbed him, took him to a pool of water, and said, “Why do you eat grass, and why do you bleat? Look how I’m eating meat. You eat it too. Look at this—see how your face refl ected in the water is like mine!” Seeing all of this, the young tiger also relished the meat.20It is of some signifi cance that this Indian parable was originally used in both the Bengali text and especially in Vivekananda’s English lec-tures as a polemical tale to reject the Christian theology of sin (and, by implication, the Christian model of salvation) and focus instead on the immortal nature of the eternal and pristine Self or atman. Hence Vivekananda’s famous lines at Chicago in 1893 are quoted again in the Bengali text to gloss his Master’s story: “Ye are the children of God, the sharers of immortal bliss, holy and perfect beings. Ye divinities on earth—Sinners! It is a sin to call a man so. Come up, Oh lions and shake off the delusion that you are sheep!”21The original Bengali tiger has become a lion and the goats are sheep now, perhaps to make more pointed the polemic against biblical Christi-anity (lions, sheep, and lambs all being central to Christian symbolism), but the basic point remains very much the same: the deepest core of human nature is identical to divinity and cannot be accurately described as morally corrupt, as “sinful.” In short, there is no Christian created “soul” in need of salvation from its sins; there is only the Hindu atman or Self beyond all conditionings, moral or otherwise, that needs to be realized as already immortal, blissful, and divine.Interestingly, the act that fi nally reveals this pristine Self beyond all culture and clime in the parable is the act of eating meat, that is, some-thing highly polluting and potentially transgressive to an upper-caste orthodox Hindu. There are also certain unstated but implied Tantric, even quasi-cannibalistic, echoes here, as the reader might suppose that20 Gupta, Srisriramakrsnakathamrta, in 5 vols, volume 5, p. 174; translation mine. 21 Ibid., 5.173."},{"pageNumber":517,"pageContent":"494 jeffrey j. kripalthe tiger is eating goat meat, that is, a member “of his own fl ock” (which, of course, is not really his own fl ock). This is an implicit or potential Tantric act, because both eating meat (including, in extreme cases, the cannibalistic act of eating or tasting human corpse fl esh) and sacrifi cing goats are central to the transgressive and sacrifi cial rituals of Bengali Shakta Tantra. This is not just any old roar of awakening, then. This is a Tantric roar of awakening. But no one says so: not Rama-krishna, not Vivekananda, neither Zimmer nor Campbell. Not just yet anyway.The later Zimmer/Campbell version of 1951 returns the parable back to its original tiger/goat form but adopts something of Viveka-nanda’s message as well. Now the surprised elder tiger, whom the text calls “the grim teacher,” grabs the cub by the scruff and hauls him off to his cave where he forces him to eat a bloody slab of fresh meat from a previous kill (again, we are not told what kind of meat it is). At fi rst, the cub is disgusted with the thought, but as the raw fl esh goes down, his tail begins to lash the ground, “and suddenly from his throat there bursts the terrifying, triumphant roar of a tiger.” The tiger cub is thus awakened to the “secret lore of his own nature.”22In this new context, the humorous fable becomes a powerful story of what must happen to the West, now disillusioned with its own symbols and myths, that is, with Christianity. For Zimmer, the interpretation of India’s philosophical and religious forms can and indeed should become an integral part of the West’s “Roar of Awakening,” for in them we can see our own existential situation, our own disillusionment with transi-tory superimpositions and the dogmas and rituals of deluded human beings as an obedient fl ock or herd. In them we can sense something of our own individual unconscious nature, our own “profoundly hid-den, essential yet forgotten, transcendental Self.”23Jung’s depth psychology and India’s Advaita Vedanta tradition more or less merge in such lines of thought, but it is Jung’s mature rejection of any uncritical imitation of the East and its culturally specifi c forms of psychological structure and identity that fi nally wins the day here. Like the tiger cub, the West can learn from India’s jungle lore and awaken to the Self, but it can only truly awaken to its own Self, for, as Zimmer insists, “We cannot borrow God. We must effect His new incarnation from within ourselves. Divinity must descend, somehow, 22 Zimmer, Philosophies of India, 7.23 Ibid., 11."},{"pageNumber":518,"pageContent":" the roar of awakening 495into the matter of our own existence and participate in this peculiar life-process.”24Both Zimmer’s insistence on Western civilization’s own incarnational integrity and the Indian tiger tale’s general turn away from the judging God of western monotheism to the blissful Self would play themselves out at Esalen in the early 60s, primarily through the roar of the human potential movement, which fundamentally rejected the Christian theol-ogy of original sin, the pessimistic vision of Freudian psychoanalysis, and the surface science of Skinnerian behaviorism for the more ecstatic possibilities of drug-induced mysticism, psychical powers (the Tantric Sanskrit category of the siddhi was often invoked here), and what Abra-ham Maslow was calling, in his own quasi-orgasmic language, “the peak experience.” It was a truly heady time, a time for eating meat, as if for the fi rst time. In short, it was a time for roaring.Avalon, Zimmer, Jung, and Campbell: The Tantric Textual TransmissionFollowing the pioneering work of Hugh Urban on the colonial and postcolonial construction of the category of Tantra, it is my thesis that basic to this roar of awakening was the scholarly discovery, transcultural construction, creative imagination, and actual practice of something called “Tantra,” defi ned here as a comparative construct mutually created by Western and Asian scholars over the last two centuries that nevertheless accurately names, locates, and analyzes a kind of “super-tradition” that runs throughout the history of Asian religions, including and especially those Asian religions’ recent migrations to American culture.This Tantric super-tradition is especially obvious in such local manifestations as Hindu Shakta Tantra, some forms of Indian Jainism, certainly Tibetan Vajrayana, much of Chinese Taoism and Mahayana Buddhism, as well as various forms of esoteric Japanese Buddhism, including and especially many aspects of Zen. Doctrinally speaking, this same super-tradition privileges nondual or superbinary systems of thought that advance through elaborate languages of consciousness and energy (often represented as “male” and “female,” respectively); turns to the body, and particularly the sexual body, as the privileged locus of revelation and religious experience; employs various rhetorics 24 Ibid., 2."},{"pageNumber":519,"pageContent":"496 jeffrey j. kripalof secrecy and ritual logics of transgression; embraces the pursuit of magical powers and occult practices; and sees the human being as a microcosm of the larger universe or macrocosm. “Tantra,” in other words, is our present scholarly term for naming, organizing, and com-paring what amounts to one history of Asian esotericism.It is my own conviction that when a movement like Esalen turned to Asian religions in the 1960s and 70s, what it inevitably ended up embracing was not the orthodox, conservative, and ascetic elements of these historical traditions, but their heterodox, transgressive, and erotic forms. That is to say, when Esalen turned to Asia, what it embraced was not Asia, but Asian Tantra.Certainly we can make too much of such a thesis. The term or category of Tantra, for example, has not been especially salient in the public culture, catalog offerings, or general therapeutic spirit of Esalen (but neither has it been absent). And Dick Price was certainly right to warn his students against confusing any single understanding of Esalen as the fi nal truth of the place. He thus spoke often of Esalen as the Rorschach Institute or as the Ink-Blot Institute—that is, “Esalen,” to the extent that it lived up to its central insistence that “No one cap-tures the fl ag,” had an uncanny ability to become just about anything to anyone. We have to be very careful, then, about fi nding something “Tantric” about Esalen, or almost anything else for that matter. No one captures the fl ag.But even Dick found himself powerfully, and somewhat mysteriously, drawn to Bhagwan Rajneesh, the Hindu Tantric guru of the 70s par excellence. Moreover, his commitment to the this-worldliness of Tao-ism (Price actually used the Tao Te Ching to administer the day-to-day runnings of Esalen) can be read, certainly in contemporary scholarly defi nitions, as Tantric in orientation as well.And this is just the beginning. Indeed, it is astonishing how often explicitly Tantric themes, fi gures, and ideas appear at central points or nodes in Esalen’s history. From Ida Rolf ’s early training under a con-troversial New York Tantric yogi (Pierre Bernard), through Murphy’s foundational relationship to the “right-handed” or sublimated Tantric philosophy of Sri Aurobindo and his life-long fascination with the yogic siddhis or “superpowers,” to the Kali-like womb visions of Stanislav Grof ’s LSD regression work (mind-altering substances are central to Tantric subcultures in Asia) and Esalen President Gordon Wheeler’s early devotional relationship to the Tantric guru Swami Muktananda,"},{"pageNumber":520,"pageContent":" the roar of awakening 497something of signifi cance is going on here. It is not all projection and ink-blots.Hence Steve Donovan once shared with me that as President of Esalen in the late 1980s and early 90s he discovered that there were “brakes” and “accelerators” that could be applied on the Esalen culture when needed, and that the two most effective accelerators of spirit were workshops on psychedelic or Tantric subjects. The connections between Esalen and Zen Buddhism, moreover, have long been both literal and intimate ones. Tassajara, one of America’s most distinguished Zen monasteries, sits just over the mountain from Esalen. Steve Harper and Dick Price created and maintained a literal trail between the two insti-tutions for years, and Michael Murphy has enjoyed a life-long mentor-ship and close friendship with Richard Baker Roshi, who helped found Tassajara and whose wealth of teaching experience with the esoterica of meditation includes a clear recognition that, “Zen is right-handed Tantra.” It seems, then, that there is something more than my own personal projections at work in such Esalen moments, something that deserves the carefully defi ned name of Tantra.There is also a rather clear textual and scholarly prehistory here. Historically speaking, this particular Esalen lineage can be traced at least as far back as C.G. Jung’s enthusiastic reading of Zimmer’s Kunst-form und Yoga im indischen Kultbild (1926), which was in turn inspired by Zimmer’s enthused reading of Tantric texts and early scholarship, particularly that of Sir John Woodroffe, who (with his Bengali ghost-translator, Atul Behari Ghosh) published under the fused mythological pen-name of “Arthur Avalon.”25 Later, as I have already noted, Zimmer became one of Joseph Campbell’s earliest and most important men-tors in New York in the early 1940s. After Zimmer’s sudden death in 1943, Campbell edited his teacher’s lectures and ghost-wrote Zimmer’s Philosophies of India, a popular and widely read text that culminates in the striking argument that Tantra is the summation and pinnacle of all of Indian religious thought.It was this claim or reading (echoed, to be sure, in many other scholars and readers, from Mircea Eliade’s classic Yoga: Immortality and Freedom, to Aldous Huxley’s Tantric utopian novel, Island), I would suggest, that in 25 For this remarkable story of transcultural cooperation (and dissimulation), see Taylor, Sir John Woodroffe."},{"pageNumber":521,"pageContent":"498 jeffrey j. kripalturn fl owed into Esalen’s history and the broad counterculture, turningboth into profoundly “Tantric” phenomena, at least with respect to their adoption and embrace of Asian religious ideas and practices. Henceforth, whenever a Western actor turned East for inspiration or an image, it was more often than not a Tantric idea or image that he or she fi nally chose.26 Hence the cakras and the kundalini of Tantric Hinduism, the copulating Buddhas of Tibetan Vajrayana Buddhism, and the yin-yang icon of Taoism would come to dominate the art of the countercultural landscape.27It was the Avalon-Zimmer-Jung lineage again that Campbell brought to Esalen in the late 60’s, where it took root and fl ourished, precisely along the lines Zimmer had set out as his own life and work. “It was, I felt, not the right solution,” Zimmer wrote, “simply to swallow Eastern wisdom hook and sinker, as did the Theosophists, Neo-Buddhists, etc. The task was to transmute it so as to make it fi t into the context of our own experiences and traditions: a process of mutual transmutation, assimilation.”28 All of his books and articles, Zimmer insisted, were “parts and documents of this process of assimilation and transmuta-tion,”29 that is, of this Tantric transmission into the West. The same, I would argue, is true about much of the literature that has swirled around Esalen.Consider, for example, Joseph Campbell’s earliest appearances at Esalen and his Zimmerian understanding of cultural translation, transformation, and transmission. Although Campbell’s fi rst seminar, on “Mask, Myth and Dream” (October 14–16, 1966) did not signal any explicit Tantric themes, his second major appearance, a year later, involved a whole fl urry of explicit Tantric references. On October 12–15, 1967, for example, Campbell gave three separate seminars, two in San Francisco and one in Big Sur (at this point, Esalen ran a San Francisco center along with its Big Sur institute). The fi rst in San Francisco, entitled “Freud, Jung & Kundalini Yoga,” synthesized 26 There were, of course, exceptions. One thinks in particular of the ascetic devo-tionalism of ISKCON or the consistent popularity of Theravada meditation techniques and traditions. My thesis is offered as a general pattern to note and refl ect on, then, not as a universal rule to impose everywhere.27 For more on this thesis, see my “Remembering Ourselves”; and “Western Popular Culture.”28 See “Appendix: Some Biographical Remarks about Henry R.

Rather, he was interested, as always, in exploring how these “initiatory symbols” could take on relevance for what he called “the adventure of modern life.”30 This was pure Esalen. It was also classical Zimmer.As scholars have noted repeatedly, the Tantra one gets in California (or Kali-fornia for the smiling) is not the Tantra one gets in Calcutta. At Esalen, moreover, this Westernization runs even deeper, since the Tantra that was transmitted to Esalen was transmitted partly through the English writings of Sri Aurobindo, who had already profoundly Westernized the system through his creative incorporation of evolu-tionary science, translated here into the world-affi rming notion that the Divine incarnates in the universe in a progressive historical and fully embodied fashion—in essence, and in Murphy’s terms now, an “evolutionary Tantra.” In other words, even when Asian or Tantric ideas and disciplines are occasionally practiced at Esalen, they are embraced only after they have been refracted through the psychological, scientifi c, economic, and political lenses of European and American culture. Again, Hanegraaff ’s notion of secularization, which we might here reframe as “Asian esotericism become western esotericism in the mirror of secular thought.”At times, perhaps many times, this refraction through modernity has resulted in forms of American Tantra that bear very little resemblance to their premodern Asian origins and lack, almost completely, the deep textual grounding of a Heinrich Zimmer or the psychological critique of a C.G. Jung. Scholars of Tantra such as Hugh Urban and David Gordon White have been critical of many of these contemporary forms, especially the weekend romance seminar format.31 Similarly, 30 Esalen catalog, October 13, 1967. 31 See Urban, Tantra; and White, Kiss of the Yogini.

But it is also this. As someone, then, who wants to ground a history of Esalen in what are essentially mystico-erotic sensibilities, I approach the Esalen Tantric materials, very much with Urban, as imaginal fusions of Indian and American cultures. There is no place in a historian’s toolbox for gross illusions like cultural purity, religious essences, or unchanging tradition: everything is a mingling and merging, a transformation and a constant creation. Urban powerfully captures something of this truth with respect to American forms of Tantra when he writes:Tantra, it would seem, lies at a pivotal intersection between Indian and American imaginations, at the nexus of a complex play of representations and misrepresentations between East and West taking place over the last two hundred years. Not only was it a crucial part of the Western “imag-ining of India,” particularly during the colonial era; but it has been no less crucial a part of the “re-imagining of America,” particularly during the eras of sexual liberation, feminism, gay rights and sexual politics at the turn of the new millennium.33I would only add a relevant geographic note here, namely, that, if Calcutta was the epicenter of this East-West fusion in the nineteenth-century, California, and in particular San Francisco and Big Sur, became here. Urban, for example, is insistent that scholars should pay more critical attention to modern forms of Tantra, which he explicitly links to the history of Western eso-tericism via modern sexual magic. For his fullest statement on this latter thesis, see his Magia Sexualis.32 The term “Pleasure Tantra” is derived from Victor Bliss and Nathan James, who use it to criticize the romance workshops of Marin County, just north of San Francisco: “I resent the way the easy self-help sex books and Marin-style Pleasure Tantra never address the issue of sexual addiction. There is something terribly deceitful about that, a kind of glossy betrayal” (The ManTantra Letters, 200). In a similar spirit, the authors also refer to “New Age woo woo” (262) and “Bay Area bullshit” (77).33 Urban, “The Omnipotent Oom.”"},{"pageNumber":524,"pageContent":" the roar of awakening 501the epicenters of this Tantric re-imagining in the 1960s, 70s, 80s and 90s—from Bengal to Big Sur, as it were.An Exemplum of the Thesis: The “Esalen Novel” of John HeiderWhen all is said and done, then, “Tantra” is a word, that is, a cultural reality, not a natural phenomenon (like hot water) or a physiological fact (like testosterone or a penis). It thus should not surprise us that its most dramatic appearances at Esalen are all in texts. There are far too many examples to note, much less to analyze here. There is, however, one particularly dramatic and instructive corpus of such appearances that deserves more attention and analysis than I could give it in my earlier study of Esalen’s history, the unpublished writings of John Heider.John Heider lived at Esalen from 1967 until 1971 as a key encounter group leader and community personality. These were especially forma-tive times for both the institute and for Heider. Happily, Heider kept a journal for most of this period and later composed numerous essays and even two novels as a means of working through or processing his experiences at Esalen and after. All of these texts remain unpublished. I have briefl y analyzed the Tantric structure of Heider’s Esalen journal and a few of his essays in the earlier historiographic project. I was not able, however, to treat his novels. One of these, Living in Paradox, is particularly expressive of that same Tantric structure and so deserves much more attention here.Living in Paradox: A Utopian Soap Opera (1976), is one long medita-tion on the charismatic magic and the moral failings of the Esalen countercultural experiment in which Heider participated in the late 1960s and early 70s. The novel focuses on a small fi ctional town in northeastern Kansas called Paradox, “Founded 1856. Population 2317. Elevation 1136 ft.”34 Originally, the place was supposed to be called Paradise, but the cranky postmaster who applied for the post offi ce box accidentally—but not unintentionally—put down “Paradox” instead.35 And so it became. In this bit of mischievous misspelling, in this inten-tional mistake, lies the entire metaphysical sweep of the novel, which 34 Heider, Living in Paradox, chapter 3, page 22 (henceforth LP, followed by chapter and page, for example, LP 3.22); used with permission of the author.35 LP 4.2."},{"pageNumber":525,"pageContent":"502 jeffrey j. kripalmoves from the Christian search for some fi nal answer or complete salvation in an eternal and never-changing heaven, to a deeply Taoist sense of process and paradox, of reality as a never-ending cycle of confl icting opposites that are nevertheless deeply, erotically, related. From Paradise to Paradox, then: this is the structuring secret of both Heider’s “fi ctional” text and his own real-life psychospiritual journey in and through Esalen.The narrative of the novel involves a middle-aged Boston couple named Barry and Jean Baker. Barry is a successful lawyer, and Jean is one of Boston’s many socialites. Suffering from a shared mid-life crisis of sorts, in March of 1967 they hop on a motorcycle and travel out to California (much like John and Anne Heider did that same summer) in order to attend an Esalen seminar led by Bill Schutz called “More Joy” (an actual seminar series which Heider, in real life, helped coor-dinate). Immensely turned on by the experience whose psychophysical breakthroughs remind Barry of the fi rst time he and Jean made love in college (more on that later), they decide they have enough money and guts to try their hand at starting their own alternative community.After their San Francisco bisexual friend, Gustavo, shows them around the Bay Area, hoping they will buy there, they fi nally decide to purchase an abandoned college property in Paradox, Kansas, instead. Gustavo is appalled, offering the usual platitudes about Kansas and suggesting that the state is precisely the black-and-white boredom the characters of “The Wizard of Oz” escaped from on their way to the delicious Technicolor brilliance of a California Oz. “No one goes to Kansas,” Gustavo insists with his exaggerated horror. “You know they won’t let me come too!” But Jean Baker knows better than to take so seriously the pretensions of the West (or the East) Coast. She thus compassionately answers Gustavo with a bit of midwestern paradox, that is, she answers in the middle: “Oh dear! Of course, they will let you in, Gustavo. There must be some homosexuals in Kansas. And even in the movie, the Tin Woodsman, the Cowardly Lion, the Scarecrow, Toto . . . Why, all of them, even the Wizard, were really from Kansas. The Land of Oz wasn’t real, Gustavo. Dorothy was in an altered state of consciousness: she was hallucinating!”36 Gustavo is eventually convinced and quickly warms up to the place recognizing, in the end, that Oz and Kansas are indeed the same place and that, as another character 36 LP 3.12–13."},{"pageNumber":526,"pageContent":" the roar of awakening 503realizes later on in the novel through a bit of identifi ed Tantric wisdom, “What is here is elsewhere.

The new college is thus able to draw a delightfully diverse crew from the furthest ends of the Bakers’ social spectrum: their daughter Claire, for example, insists on coming with them and asserting there her own spiritual and sexual freedoms, before them. Gustavo moves in and brings along Luz, his faithful housekeeper who also happens to be a psychi-cally gifted bruja or witch. Later, he will bring along members of his gay community and settle into one of the college’s nicer homes, now dubbed “the Gentleman’s Club.” Brash young hippies, with names like Rasher, Tilth, Vision, and Ganja, show up after meeting the Bakers in the redwoods of California and reading about them in an alterna-tive magazine. Similarly, a gifted Zen teacher named Max Schaeffer appears to play the meditation and awareness-is-everything card (he eventually learns that meditation is not everything),38 as does Jubilo, an African-American veteran and masseur whose contemplative massages of white women draws the ire of a bit of hate-mail but the ultimate support of the college community: “We will take our risks, knowingly,” they conclude. A bit later, an African-American woman by the name of Ophelia shows up to attract Jubilo’s erotic attention and so effectively dispel the racial tensions.Not that this was absolutely necessary. This, after all, was Bleeding Kansas, “the fi rst battle ground of the Civil War” and an adamant defender of American individualism and the freedom of the slaves.39 The citizens of Paradox, educated in this long and proud history of Kansas liberalism and a pragmatic live-and-let-be, quickly warm up to the new strange community among them.

There is, for example, that tension between individual freedom and community stability, between the need to nur-ture experimentation and the need to make money, or, more practically, between the traditional wisdom of home childbirth and an appreciation of the local hospital when these traditional methods fail.41They also come to learn that neither pure conservatism nor pure liberalism will do, that each needs the other, that the pendulum will always swing back, and that traditionalism and stability are necessary for any effective revolution.42 Jean sees this almost immediately: “I just want a safe adventure,” she tells her beloved Gustavo, “a little stable chaos, a revolution on a fi rm foundation! Maybe, I just want to live in paradox.”43 Interestingly, Heider appears to see this paradox as an apt expression of Kansas’s geographic location in the exact middle of the country: Kansas is America’s “neither East nor West,” its both-and. Thus when the college comrades sign their Paradox Covenant, they do so on July 4, 1967, and seal the document with a Taoist yin-yang symbol.44 So too one of the citizens of Paradox explains to Jean how “[t]he primary paradox in Kansas is being fi ercely independent and at the same time respectful of others, cooperative, even in a way conformist.”45It is in this midwestern American context that the novel embraces, translates, and eventually transforms into what it calls simply “tantra.”46 This thirty-six chapter process begins, though, not with an American 41 LP 32.22.42 LP 29.11.43 LP 3.11.44 LP 8.26.45 LP 32.5.46 This cultural transmission is possible because of the metaphysics of Tantra itself, which fi nally denies the ultimacy of cultural and political boundaries through an affi r-mation of the universal (and always sexual) body: “What is here is elsewhere.

It was there, beneath the piano, that a youthful Barry Baker and Jean Anshaw experienced what the Indian Upanishads had known as ananda, the “bliss” that undergirds the universe, and what Will Schutz was now claiming as his own human potential notion of “joy,” that natural state of all human beings that can be actualized with the right techniques and attitudes.47 The fi rst few pages of Living in Paradox implicitly connects both this ancient bliss and this modern joy to the Baker’s sexual ecstasy under the piano: “Bliss. Yes, the earth had moved, bells had rung, and neither could ever forget that absolute proof of the existence of God and the triumph of love that lingered for days and weeks.”48One has the sense—I have the sense anyway—that the rest of the novel is an elaborate working out of this original erotic gnosis on page 6, that the novel, fi rst and foremost, functions as a narrative setting for the proclamation and celebration of this real-life sexo-spiritual diamond. I am reminded here of Wilhelm Reich, who discovered something of immense metaphysical signifi cance in the arms of an Italian girl with whom he had intercourse in 1916 while he was a soldier and spent the rest of his life trying to name it, eventually as a cosmic “orgone” (perhaps this is why Heider loves Reich so).One also has the sense—I have the sense anyway—that, although Heider knew a great deal about comparative mystical literature, when he looked around for available and truly adequate symbols to express this original erotic gnosis, he could not fi nd any in the Western religions. Like the American counterculture, he thus turned to Asian languages and iconographies, and more specifi cally to the Tao and the Tantra. Here he found what he was looking for. Here, he recognized some-thing of himself. John Heider thus speaks through Jean Baker, who “[w]henever she heard mentioned the subject of sexual meditation,” that is, the subject of tantra, she found her “ears pricking up,” as if, she confessed, “something very deep in me” is being touched. “It feels almost like a memory from another incarnation.”4947 LP 1.3 and 1.4. 48 LP 1.6.49 LP 13.23."},{"pageNumber":529,"pageContent":"506 jeffrey j. kripalHeider more or less says the same in the novel, through the character of Max speaking to Richard, Gustavo’s lover: “we have no widely-known Western traditions of spiritual sexuality. Oh, there’s Oneida and Karezza and magnetic sex. But Christianity—that’s our primary infl u-ence—doesn’t have much to offer on the body. Nothing good below the diaphragm. Christians distrust pleasure, especially sexual pleasure.”50“So what is Tantra in twenty fi ve words or less?” Richard reason-ably asks. Max answers back immediately, in twenty nine: “Tantric meditation opens the whole human body to the energies of sexual intercourse, refi ning and amplifying them, and creating a more perfect union between oneself, one’s beloved, and God.” More technically—and more practically—tantra is about having sex without coming, that is, it is a kind of contemplative coitus reservatus.51 Here is how it worked for the College community, through which tantra was spreading, “like a prairie fi re.”52 “Suppose,” the lovely hippie muse, Horizon, explains to Jubilo, “Suppose we were naked. And you sat on a zafu [meditation pillow] with your legs crossed, like meditation, in the lotus position. And I sat down on you, in your lap, face to face, my legs around you, taking you up inside me. And we just sat that way, breathing in unison, for thirty minutes or even an hour.”53 Jubilo no doubt expresses the feelings of many a male reader when he confesses that he “couldn’t take it.” Still, that is what tantra is all about, at least for this novel. It is about riding sexual desire until it morphs into spiritual experience. It is about the paradoxical union of Spirit and Sex.Although hardly refl ective of all of Tantra in South Asia, much of which involves the literal production of sexual fl uids (that is, coming) as sacrifi cial offerings to the Goddess,54 such a practice bears a striking resemblance to the “male continence” techniques of John Humphrey Noyes, which the novel freely admits and connects literally to the KansasGovernor Charles Robinson, as well as to the maithuna or sexual inter-50 LP 26.13.51 LP 11.16.52 LP 15.10.53 LP 13.8.54 See especially White, Kiss of the Yogini.

As such, it is something of both an East-West fusion and a refl ection of the state of knowledge of Tantric practices in the 60s and 70s, which more or less equated the tradition with, well, not coming.But even Tantra is not suffi cient unto itself. It too must be balanced by its opposites, that is, by Christianity, the West, and what the novel calls simply the Law. Barry Baker, at least, insists on what he calls the paradox of the Way and the Law, which at one point he sees incarnated, of all places, in the “burning bush” of Ophelia’s vagina.56 The Way or Tao may need the Law, but in the end both are subsumed within the Tantra. One of the California hippies, Ganja,57 also becomes a spokes-person here by his double claim that “[a]ll creation is dualistic, consisting of a dance of opposites,” and that we are not whole and become sick primarily and most deeply because of sexuality and gender: “Deeper than race or religion or nation, deeper than neurosis or psychosis, or even species is sex,” he insists. If we wish to become truly whole, then, Ganja claims that we must escape the trap of yin or yang, that is, we must escape the trap of sexual differentiation or gender itself.58This, it turns out, is one of the fi nal and most radical claims of the novel. It is one of the deepest meanings of truly “living in paradox.” The novel itself suggests that Huxley knew about this attempt to go beyond gender, that the earliest Christian priests had Agapetae, or female ritual lovers, and that both the early Christian Gnostics and the later Catholic moralists permitted a form of coitus reservatus, the latter “claiming that it was known to Adam in the Garden and therefore a part of Paradise.”59Here we come to my alliterative thesis again “from Paradise to Para-dox,” that is, here we fi nally arrive at a return to Paradise, not through the ascetic and certain means of salvation and the Gospel of Paul, but through the Goddess of the Gnostics and their sexual meditations,60 here joined to the contemplative techniques of Asian Tantra.

Or in Barry Baker’s words now: “We are discover-ing a new way, an American Tao, a Western Sadhana, a New Path Up The Mountain.”61 By such a Path, Paradise has become Paradox, and a little town in Kansas has become the center of the universe. And why not? “What is here is elsewhere. What is not here is nowhere.”Heider’s Living in Paradox is one of the fullest and most insightful analyses of Esalen of which I am aware. Writing the novel was a way of doing history for Heider, who realized that a traditional and pub-lished historical account would upset many and offend more than few. He could say what he wanted to say and remember what he wanted to remember in the format of fi ction, however. That was different. And so this is what he did. He wrote a work of fi ction that was largely factual. He revealed the truth by concealing the truth. But the Tantric transmission remained encoded into the heart of the text. How could it not? It was central to that sexual-textual history.Re-Orienting the TantraThis same Esalen Tantra hardly went away as the decades ticked by. In some ways, it increased; in other ways, it changed. Partly, this was a refl ection of the academic culture. By the mid-1990s, Tantric Studies was enjoying a kind of broad cultural awakening, with a large group of highly trained scholars—many of them emerging from a deeply existential and sometimes psychedelic engagement with the counter-culture—churning out hundreds of technical studies and translations. Moreover, both the interpretive potential and the liberalizing social trajectories of the feminist, gay, and lesbian movements were also hav-ing their effects, as books on the Tantric traditions began to appear that turned to gender theory and the question of sexual orientation to re-interpret traditional Asian texts. The results were often provocative. Drawing on these same broad intellectual shifts, other more popular texts grounded in extensive personal experience and practice were also being written. Two that were connected to Esalen are worth mentioning here as a prelude to closing.Victor Bliss (a pen-name of an Esalen regular) and Nathan James wrote The ManTantra Letters, an explicitly homoerotic text that explores 61 LP 25.6."},{"pageNumber":532,"pageContent":" the roar of awakening 509many of the western Tantric themes that we have been tracing all along. This is hardly the kind of superfi cial popularization that one often reads about in the scholarly literature. To take just a few of its literally hundreds of themes: Freud, Reich, and Jung are treated as proto-Tantric thinkers;62 Plato, particularly in the erotic dialogues of the Symposium and Phaedrus, is understood as a gnostic tantric;63 Rumi is read as a poetic master of manlove;64 San Francisco (complete with an unfl inching gaze into the horrors of the AIDS epidemic) becomes “the most tantric town;”65 LSD is experienced as an initiation into Bud-dhist emptiness;66 gay sexuality is linked to Freud and Tantric eroticism through their mutual breaking of exclusive genital sexuality and their understanding of the fundamental mobility or fl uidity of desire;67 the cakras and tantric body are described as “entirely fantasmatic,” that is, they are a “pure product of the imagination,” “a fantasy body that nevertheless has real effects”;68 and the standard heterosexuality of Tantric and Taoist symbolism is explicitly rejected as “the sexual activity of straight couples elevated to the level of a mystery religion,” that is, as politics mistakenly projected as universal metaphysics.69 Moreover, and most impressively, a sophisticated mystico-erotic theory (linked to Freud’s notion of sublimation) is constructed to explain how Tantric ritual can uncouple desire from its usual objects and so allow it to fl y past its target into altered states of consciousness and energy, including 62 Bliss and James, The ManTantra Letters, 30, 274–277.63 Ibid., 207–208, 317. Bliss links the Greek gnosis to the Sanskrit jnana (ibid., 246, 283), which in fact share the same Indo-European root. 64 Ibid., 209.65 Ibid., 44. 66 Ibid., 5767 Ibid., 276–277.68 Ibid., 277. This is James’s position. Bliss responds that the tantric body is neither arbitrary nor merely a product of the subjective imagination; rather, it is an expres-sion of a different kind of objectivity, “really a trans-subjective, or trans-consciousness objectivity, which refl ects the actual universal structure of each and every conscious-ness” (ibid., 282).69 Ibid., 163–181. Bliss is again less critical here than James, seeing “the heterosexual bias” of Tantra as an inevitable expression of procreation and the physiology of the vagina, which is entered, and the phallus, which enters, and linking all of this to the yin-yang symbolism of Taoism. Such symbolism is “primordial,” Bliss insists, “and no gays shouting protests from the rooftops are ever going to change it one iota” (165). Perhaps this is why Bliss’s guru, Bhagwan Rajneesh, condemned homosexuality (ibid., 75–76). In any case, Bliss observes that, “we have to keep in mind that we are an experiment” (ibid., 166)."},{"pageNumber":533,"pageContent":"510 jeffrey j. kripalthe yin or valley orgasm of bliss and the yang of ecstasy (note again the merging of the Tantra and the Tao).70Not unlike Heider’s movement “from Paradise to Paradox,” Bliss also tracks a defi nite personal transformation from Christianity to Asian Tantra around what he calls “the whole sexual contradiction in Christianity,” which he intuits as the tradition’s simultaneous encoding of anti-sex teachings and a rich homoerotic imagery shadowed by the specter of pederastic abuse: “It happened when I was in my early teens trying to pray my way out of my sexuality. I was doing tolerably well, though when I was in church, I kept fi nding myself eyeing that naked man up on the cross, not quite comfortable about the way it made me feel in my loins.” He then relates how an Episcopalian priest tried to seduce him at a summer church camp: “I repelled him (his come-on was pretty creepy), but then—I promptly threw up.” From this he concluded that the church’s “position on sex is untenable, as ludicrous as that priest,” and that such contradictions would one day “blow up right in the face of the church.” He also recognized, however, that all religions tend to generate in precisely this way, and that Christianity, particularly in its gospel genius of unconditional love, could be so much more than “the fundamentalism fl aying us today,” the Catholicism that brought us the Inquisition, and the Puritanism of the early colonists. Bliss, in other words, does not romanticize the East, nor does he dismiss Christianity. He recognizes the excessive moral controls of all the tradi-tions, and he turns to Tantra not because it is perfect, but because “of all the religious disciplines, it seems most sex friendly.”71Especially pertinent here is the book’s fundamental distinction between what it calls “yoga” and “tantra,” a distinction Bliss learned from years of studying at the feet of the Hindu Tantric guru Bhagwan Rajneesh (only after he had studied Sanskrit and the Upanishads in Benares for two full years). Here is how he put it in correspondence with me in response to the present essay and its Tantric transmission thesis:70 For the mystico-erotic theorizing, see ibid., 103, 105, 211, 242, 276–277, 296, 328. For the Taoist yin and yang language, see ibid., 190–191, 251.71 Ibid., 5–7. This letter is dated February 25, 1992, that is, about ten years before the Boston clerical scandals made all of these issues patently, tragically obvious, if never really resolved. James also shares Bliss’s homoerotic reading of Christianity. Hence later in the text he will read a painting at the Louvre of Thomas sticking his fi ngers in Christ’s wounds as a symbolic form of anal penetration (ibid., 49)."},{"pageNumber":534,"pageContent":" the roar of awakening 511The conception that Bhagwan introduced to me and that I have main-tained ever since is that yoga and tantra represent fundamentally different psychological dispositions towards transcendence. Yoga is the disposition to achieve some ideal state of being, and tantra is the counter disposi-tion to arrive at wholeness or fullness. Restraint and posture is the yogic discipline; surrender is the tantric discipline. This has been very clarifying to me psychologically and historically. Freud was critical here. He saw that devotion to the ego ideal (the superego) generated pathology, and his prescription to own the disowned shifted the ethos to tantrism, a striving for wholeness which has been the basis of therapy since Freud, via Jung and Gestalt, and pervades virtually all of the Esalen new therapies and the California “optimysticism.”72In the book itself, Bliss makes the exact same distinction, adding that yogis tend to be “ordered, disciplined, and moralistic,” whereas Tantrics tend to be “very quirky, individualistic, and often anarchistic, as they break through their own inauthenticity and raise hell with the order of established society.”73 If the Western yogis of the 1970s, then, were shown again and again to be hypocrites, preaching celibacy in public but keeping all sorts of sexual skeletons in their closets, the Tantrics “are richly adorned with their skeletons,” that is, they hang their skeletons in the living room for all to see.74 Put differently and much more abstractly, generally speaking, whereas either/or thinking is “very yogic” and is linked to the moral judgments and exile of Original Sin (with all the attending repression, denial, and hypocrisy this entails), both/and thinking is “very tantric” and is related to being itself, the play of opposites, and the unity of extremes, “where spirit and fl esh truly meet.”75 We are back, in other words, to a familiar movement “from Paradise to Paradox.”After his years with Rajneesh, whom he affectionately refers to as “truly the bad boy of 20th century Gurus” and “a Master of Left 72 Private correspondence, 22 October 2006.

The ManTantra Letters are, in effect, an attempt to synthesize these “left-handed” and “right-handed” methods into a new wholeness, a new yoga/tantra polarity whereby “sexuality becomes an expression of the spirit, and spirit becomes an expression of sexuality.”77Also relevant here is the work of Marina T. Romero and Ramon V. Albareda, two contemporary Spanish teachers who, with the col-laboration of the transpersonal theorist Jorge Ferrer, have taught a form of sexual-spiritual practice at Esalen that manifests some quite extraordinary similarities to (and important differences from) traditional forms of Tantra. Called Holistic Sexuality (or Holistic Integration), the technique is based on over three decades of work with individuals and couples from around the world and is offered in the integral and evolu-tionary language of the human potential movement. The authors, for example, speak often of “sexuality, spirituality, and human evolution” (the subtitle of one of their essays),78 of “integral evolution,” and of the need of practice-based approaches, even as they are also very careful to distance themselves from any traditional religion. Theirs, in my own terms now, is a sexual-spiritual practice of the religion of no religion.The system works by positing two basic fi eld of human nature: “the energy of transcendent consciousness” and “the dark energy.” The latter expression refers to “an energetic state in which all potentialities are still undifferentiated and, therefore, cannot be seen by the ‘light’ of consciousness.”79 This same dark energy is also considered to be the source of all spiritual creativity and innovation; it is the secret of new spiritualities, the prima materia of the religion of no religion. Such energy certainly cannot be reduced to simple “sexuality,” but sexuality remains one of its fi rst and most important “soils” for organization and development.Suggesting that much of the history of religions consists of the privileging of transcendent modes of consciousness that are actually states of dissociation from the body and nature, Romero and Albareda call for a new integration of transcendent consciousness and dark energy within the analogical language of a single “magnetic fi eld.” 76 Ibid., 34.77 Ibid., 8, 327.78 Romero and Albareda, “Born on Earth.” 79 Ferrer, “Integral Transformative Practice,” 29."},{"pageNumber":536,"pageContent":" the roar of awakening 513Only within such a new spiritual-sexual integration can the debilitating spiritual and cultural effects of sexual repression, condemnation, and consequent shame be reversed and new modes of consciousness and energy be developed (“from Paradise to Paradox” again). The actual work of the Spaniards at Esalen has thus involved teaching individuals and couples how to reconnect with their own dark energy fi eld and “magnetize” this into creative communion with their different states of consciousness as these manifest in everyday life, human relationship, and spiritual experience.Such a practice may initially look like traditional Asian forms of Tantra, but the differences are deep and important ones. To begin with, there is no sexual intercourse in Holistic Sexuality. As Ferrer explained it to me, sexual intercourse is “the road most traveled” for sexual energy, “and so it tends to move in more conditioned circuits within the organism.” Abstaining from intercourse while arousing these energies in contemplative and deeply relational ways thus allows other paths and circuits, roads less traveled, to be explored. We have here, that is, another form of the decoupling of desire from genitality.Foremost among these roads less traveled is the one toward a fuller and fuller integration of consciousness and energy. Hence sexual energies are never employed to propel consciousness into expanded or transcendent states of disembodiment. Rather, Holistic Sexuality “seeks to catalyze a genuine integration of consciousness and energy at all levels of the person (somatic, vital emotional, mental, etc.).” This latter process of integration involves the mutual transformation of consciousness and energy, so that consciousness becomes eroticized and the instinctual drives are “awakened” into fuller forms of aware-ness. In this same spirit, the method rejects all the usual patriarchal structures of authority of the traditional Asian systems (so prominent in the various guru scandals of the 1970s and 80s), as well as that standard sexual imagery whereby consciousness is understood as male and energy or matter is understood as female (we have already seen Heider and Nathan James rejecting the same symbolic equations). Finally, Holistic Sexuality is much more oriented toward humanistic and environmental values than specifi cally religious ones. Accordingly, the practice seeks no transhuman states of divinity and insists that our true home is right here, on planet earth.8080 These last two paragraphs are based on a personal communication with Jorge Ferrer on 18 October 2006."},{"pageNumber":537,"pageContent":"514 jeffrey j. kripalThe Tiger and the LambWhen Joseph Campbell edited Zimmer’s Philosophies of India, he chose to begin and end the book with Ramakrishna. It is not entirely clear why he chose to do this. Perhaps he did so because a few years earlier he had been working with Swami Nikhilananda on the latter’s classic translation of the Bengali Kathamrta into English, The Gospel of Sri Rama-krishna (1942). Or perhaps it was because Campbell fi rst met Zimmer at a Jungian dinner party hosted and prepared by Nikhilananda.81 I suspect, however, that the reasons go much deeper than either temporal coincidence or cuisine and ultimately involve Campbell’s and Zimmer’s metaphysics, which, as I have already noted, were both essentially Tantric in structure and rhetorical accent.We have already seen that the very fi rst chapter of Philosophies of India was inspired by Ramakrishna’s parable of the young tiger raised by goats and his subsequent roar of awakening at the insistent teach-ing and forceful paws of an older tiger. In the fi fth and fi nal chapter of the book on Tantra (which Campbell makes clear he himself wrote almost entirely, if from Zimmer’s notes), the author returns again to Ramakrishna, as if to fi nally suggest the Tantric moral of the fi rst story and, with it, the Tantric secret subtext of all of Indian philosophy. For although Western scholars may have fi rst been introduced to the ascetic and dualistic modes of Hindu and Buddhist tradition (Advaita Vedanta and Theravada Buddhism), “in recent years the power and profundity of the Tantric system have begun to be appreciated, and therewith has been facilitated a new understanding of Indian life and art.”82 For Campbell-speaking-as-Zimmer, at least, it is the dialectic tension between the old dualistic asceticism and the later Tantrism and their eventual synthesis in “the courageous esotericism of the Tantras and in the Tantric Mahayana [Buddhism]”83 that has brought to pass “the miracle of Indian civilization.”84Campbell takes “Kali, the dark and beautiful Goddess-Dancer of the Cremation Ground”85 as the archetypal deity of this miracle 81 Doniger, “The King and the Corpse.”82 Zimmer, Philosophies of India, 597.83 Ibid., 601.84 Ibid., 599.85 Ibid., 580."},{"pageNumber":538,"pageContent":" the roar of awakening 515and Ramakrishna, her most famous devotee, as its clearest and most modern exponent. But there is a real problem here, and Campbell knows it. Hence he points out that although Ramakrishna certainly preached a Tantric worldview that divinizes the material world as an energetic manifestation of transcendent consciousness, he in fact largely rejected both the world-affi rming implications of this philosophy and the radical sexual techniques of its sacramental expression.86 And in this, Campbell suggests, Ramakrishna accurately represents much of modern Hinduism, for “[n]either the saintly nor the gentlemanly Hindu of today . . . favors the boldness of this heroic view. Instead, the attitude formerly assigned to the pasu [the ‘animal’ or ‘beast’] is recommended for all, that namely of worshiping the life force (sakti) not as the Bride but as the Mother, and thus submitting, like a child, to a sort of sacra-mental castration.”87 Campbell, again as Zimmer, glosses this child-like approach to divinity as the “safe-and-sane sadhana [spiritual practice] of the pious lamb.”88This latter phrase is very telling. Although the Tantric distinction between the spiritual states and capacities of the three classes of human beings—pasu, vira and divya or Beast, Hero and Deity—is a traditional one, I am aware of no Indian text in which the pasu is framed as a lamb, nor in which an approach to the Shakti as Mother is considered “beast-like,” nor for that matter one in which the divya is glossed as “the Man-God” (another clear but subtle and quite heretical Christianiza-tion). These changes, though, echo Vivekananda’s nineteenth-century transformation of the goat of the opening parable into the lamb of his Chicago speech in order to criticize Christianity’s obsession with sin and his call for the divinization of each and every Self.But Campbell is clearly up to something different than Vivekananda was. The fl ock of goats at the beginning of the book and the lamb as “the dark-witted animal of the herd”89 here at the end serve as a kind of framing device that he seems to be using to suggest the esoteric message of the entire six-hundred-page book, namely, that the secret of Indian philosophy, its grandest dialectical achievement, lies in Buddhist 86 This, by the way, was one of the major theses of my own Kali’s Child, where I also explain the seeming paradox of how the saint could divinize the world and reject (hetero)sexual contact at the same time: his “orientation” (bhava) was homoerotic.87 Zimmer, Philosophies of India, 589.88 Ibid., 591.89 Ibid., 588."},{"pageNumber":539,"pageContent":"516 jeffrey j. kripaland Hindu Tantra, a Tantra, however, that modern Hinduism rejects. And this changes the meaning of the opening tiger tale yet again, for now we no longer have either a Vedantic parable about awakening to one’s inner immortal Self (as we seem to have in the original Bengali story), nor a Hindu polemic against Christian notions of sin and salvation (as we quite clearly have in Vivekananda’s transformation of the story in 1893), but rather a Tantric tale about a tiger refusing the vegetarian and “pure” ways of orthodox Hinduism for the heterodox meat-eating truths of Asian Tantra, be it Hindu, Buddhist, or otherwise.There are many ways to read Esalen’s own tiger tale, its own roar of awakening. Certainly, via Huxley’s and Heard’s American brand of Advaita Vedanta and their adoption of some form of the perennial philosophy, there is a real emphasis here on the Self as the immortal, eternal base of all such experience, and with it, a certain ascetic ten-dency (this was particularly apparent in Gerald Heard). But there is also something vaguely but remarkably “Tantric” about all of this.90 When Campbell writes, then, on the very last page of Philosophies of India in 1951 that, “[t]he idea of the godhood of the individual is thus democratized in the Tantra, because understood psychologically instead of sociopolitically,”91 what I suspect he is really writing about is his own Western adoption of Tantra, a Western transmission that was later furthered at Esalen, partly by Campbell himself, Heinrich Zimmer’s most famous disciple.Simply put, I read Campbell as I read many other Esalen fi gures, that is, as a transmitter of Tantra-related ideas into American culture, transmuted and translated through a general psychoanalytic lens. With Campbell, this is hardly simply a creative interpretive projec-tion, since, as I have already noted, very early in his career, Campbell both helped to translate a Bengali Shakta Tantric text into American English (The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna). As we have seen as well, he also more or less wrote the Tantric summary and summation of Heinrich Zimmer’s infl uential Philosophies of India. I would argue that these were two formative acts for Campbell, and that something of these two texts carry forward through Campbell’s entire corpus, certainly not as a defi nitive or fi nal conclusion, but as a constant guiding inspira-90 See Matthew Kapstein, “Schopenhauer’s Shakti.” Kapstein makes the case, as I have here, that Philosophies of India is driven by a clear Tantric subtext.91 Zimmer, Philosophies of India, 602."},{"pageNumber":540,"pageContent":" the roar of awakening 517tion. From the hero fi gure itself (the vira or hero is a central theme in most Tantric systems), the hero’s supernormal powers (the Tantric siddhis), and his mystical marriage with the Great (Mother) Goddess, to Campbell’s provocative deconstructions of religious orthodoxies of all kinds, his consistent employment of kundalini yoga, his unitive or nondual metaphysic, and his understanding of mythology as an expression of the human body, actual Tantric or Tantra-like themes can be traced throughout his corpus.Appropriately, then, when Campbell sat down at Esalen with Phil Cousineau in 1982 to refl ect back on his life and work, those published refl ections end precisely as Zimmer’s Philosophies of India once began, that is, with the now familiar Tantric parable from The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna. Once again, Campbell tells the story of a vegetarian tiger cub raised in a fl ock of goats who has to be shocked into his own tiger-identity by another tiger, who forces him to transgress his own conditioned feelings of disgust and social propriety in order to eat meat (it is probably no accident that Campbell had a special fondness for rare roast beef). Campbell summarizes the moral of the parable as the secret of his entire lifework.There’s a moral here, of course. It is that we’re all really tigers living here as goats. The function of sociology and most of our religious education is to teach us to be goats. But the function of the proper interpretation of mythological symbols and meditation discipline is to introduce you to your tiger face. Then comes the problem. You’ve found your tiger face but you’re still living here with these goats. How are you going to do that? . . . When al-Hallaj or Jesus let the orthodox community know that they were tigers, they were crucifi ed. And so the Sufi s learned the les-son at that time with the death of al-Hallaj, around A.D. 900. And it is: You wear the outer garment of the law; you behave like everyone else. And you wear the inner garment of the mystic way. Now that’s the great secret of life. So with that I commit you all to be tigers in the world. But don’t let anybody know it!92This was Joe Campbell’s western esotericism. We are not who we think we are. We are not who our societies and religions tell us we are. Social science doesn’t have the answer, but mythology does. We are not vegetarian goats. We are meat-eating tigers. We are not simply human. We are also divine. But it is best not to tell anyone this astonishing 92 Campbell, The Hero’s Journey, 232."},{"pageNumber":541,"pageContent":"518 jeffrey j. kripalsecret, despite the odd fact that Campbell himself just did, in a widely circulated book no less (admittedly published posthumously).It should hardly surprise us that so many of the Esalen actors turned to some direct or distant form of Tantric esotericism and eroticism if not for their answers, then at least for their inspirations. Nor should it surprise us that conservative forces, within both American and Indian culture, would later seek to suppress or deny these same countercultural energies. The goat herd calls back the tiger cub.Such anyway is how I hear Esalen’s roar of awakening and interpret many of its erotic echoes reverberating down through the decades.
