It evolved from a researchproject I embarked upon in 1998 with my close friend and spiritual brother, ErikFreeman. On our original quest, we were favored with the generous hospitalityand historical insights of Martin P. Starr in Chicago. The result of that tripwas a paper I presented in 1999 at the second national conference of Ordo TempliOrientis in Portland, Oregon, later published as \"Ida Craddock: Sexual Mysticand Martyr for Freedom\" in the anthology Book of Lies: The Disinformation Guideto Magick and the Occult (2003). We also made many of Craddock's works availableonline at www.idacraddock.org [http://www.idacraddock.org], with the assistanceof Sharon Sheinker and the sponsorship of the O.T.O. The primary repository for Ida Craddock's works is the Special CollectionsResearch Center at the Morris Library, Southern Illinois University, Carbondale.I am indebted to the SCRC for its kind permission to publish items from itscollection, and particularly to its director, Pamela Hackbart-Dean, and staffmembers Mark Choate, Judy Simpson, and Darla Loftus, for their assistance inmaking this book a reality.Materials were also kindly made available by the Spencer Research Library at theUniversity of Kansas, the New York Academy of Medicine, the New York PublicLibrary, and the Wisconsin Historical Society. Permission to quote from TheTruth Seeker was furnished by the Truth Seeker Company. Permission to reprintAleister Crowley's review from The Equinox was furnished by Ordo TempliOrientis.I would also like to thank William Breeze for invaluable research assistance andeditorial advice, and Richard Kaczynski for additional research help. ErikFreeman has also continued to inspire and challenge me to do my best throughoutthe writing of this book. I am grateful to my editor at Red Wheel/Weiser, AmberGuetebier, for guiding me through the perilous process of publishing my firstbook, and to Lon Milo Duquette and James Wasserman for their confidence inrecommending me to undertake this project.Finally, I would like to thank my father, Vere Claiborne Chappell, forinstilling in me a sense of discipline and the importance of good grammar, andmost of all my wife, Lita-Luise Chappell, who not only provided researchassistance, but also unwavering support and understanding throughout thisjourney."},{"pageContent":"FOREWORD \"It has been my high privilege to have some practical experience as the earthlywife of an angel from the unseen world.\" So begins Ida Craddock's 1894 bookHeavenly Bridegrooms, of which the magician, Aleister Crowley, declared, \"NoMagick library is complete without it.\" Ida Craddock daringly sought to bring her understanding of the sacred symbolismand divine purpose of humanity's most elemental creative impulse—sex—to thepublic eye. For a 19th-century woman in America during the reign of moralityczar Anthony Comstock, this was worse than lunacy, especially when she appliedher wicked sense of humor to the ludicrousness of such situations as Comstock'sattack on the Egyptian belly dancers at the Chicago World's Fair. Craddock wrotein her first article for the public, \"It was easy to tell who among thespectators were unduly agitated by the sight of the Danse du Ventre, since these[persons] usually ejaculated 'disgusting,' and precipitately fled.\" Few readerswould have missed her allusions to premature ejaculation by supposed sexualpurists who lacked the refined sexual control advocated by Craddock, but shemade a vicious enemy of Comstock.Sexual surgery on women—to curb rebelliousness, sexual excess, andmasturbation—reached its height in the United States during Craddock's lifetime.It was routinely performed to \"cure\" female insanity and rehabilitate prisoners.Female castration was thought to make a woman more tractable, orderly,predictable, and cleanly. Among middle-class women, whose ideal was apassionless sexual restraint, physical response was perceived as coarse, common,and immodest.1 Craddock evidenced knowledge of explicit sexual practices thatwould \"pass unquestioned if coming from a scientist\" but, from an unmarriedwoman with no \"illicit experience,\" was considered proof she must be insane. Nowonder Craddock fled to England when her mother tried to have her committed toan asylum. Can we fail to feel for her when, after being hounded by Comstock fornine years, she chose suicide, in a deliberate act of martyrdom, rather thanserve a long prison sentence? Be sure to read \"Ida's Last Letter to the Public\"to discover the gross iniquities of the case.In 1994, my biography of three original female members of the 19th-centurymagical organization, the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, was published withthe subtitle \"Rebels and Priestesses.\" Thus, it seems fitting that I was askedto write the foreword to this book about an \"outlaw and mystic\" from the sameperiod and a similar occult background. I wanted to know what motivated andenabled these women to walk the borderland between society and spirit with suchclarity and self-determination, and to understand how they succeeded and howthey failed. The Golden Dawn had its own brush with the magical aspects of the\"sex issue\" and skirted it by suspending a couple of members and reserving suchmatters for only the highest levels of the Inner Order, which few ever attained.Ida Craddock advocated a form of Western tantra rooted in the practices ofseveral turn-of-the-century American spiritual communities. Through pamphletsand an extensive private clientele, she recommended that a married couple \"enterinto harmonious relations with the ideal, generous and pure\" through controlledrelations (including the restriction of seminal emissions during orgasm) thatshe described in exacting detail. As an additional benefit, all children wouldbe the result of deliberate choice, not accidents. In a field dominated in boththe East and West by males, misogyny, and secrecy, Craddock spoke and counseledfrankly from a woman's perspective about what constituted sacred sex.Perhaps the most controversial element of her life was her public declaration ofhaving married, in October 1892, a spiritual, angelic husband who had left thephysical plane many years before. Anticipating the reaction of others, Craddockwrote that her psychical experience could be either fact or hallucination, butclaimed that the majority of her sexually explicit knowledge was a result ofthat union.With the advent of Spiritualism in 1848, a path had opened to one of the fewsocially accepted expressions of women's power—access to the spirit world. As aresearch assistant to W. T. Stead (editor of the metaphysical magazineBorderland), and through her studies with the Theosophical Society, the Societyfor Psychical Research, Christian Science, New Thought, and of teachings likethat of the Oneida Community, Craddock's knowledge of the occult was deep. Shemust have believed herself to be on the cutting edge of a new era in which thepowers of mind and direct access to the angelic world would be recognized, evenesteemed, by the more forward-thinking members of society. Instead, like thewomen who dared to teach birth control, she was hounded, institutionalized, andeventually sentenced to prison for passing on her knowledge. Some of hermaterial would be adapted, without acknowledgment, into a mid-20th-century workon sex magic. Yet her writings would surely have been lost except for a lawyerwith a special interest in free speech and in the origins of religion insexuality. Nevertheless, even Theodore Schroeder characterized her experiences(just as she had predicted) as \"erotic hallucinations,\" thus psychologizingthem.Through much of this book, biographer Vere Chappell lets Craddock speak forherself, allowing us to evaluate her accounts in our own ways. He also providesan excellent bibliography, emphasizing works on the confluence of occultism andsexuality.While not everyone will share her conviction that sexual relations should bereserved for marriage, many will be fascinated by Craddock's recommendationsregarding the spiritual side of sexuality and her clear and sensible prenuptialand marital advice. Furthermore, she was a rigorously honest and articulaterecorder of a whole class of human experience that modern science has yet toexamine with any kind of true open-mindedness. Reprinted here are Craddock'sextensively researched myths and accounts of sex along the borderlands betweenworlds—rich fodder for any writer of otherworldly romance. Even today, few havecome forward as overtly as Egyptologist Dorothy Eady (alias Om Sety, 1904-1981),who spoke openly of her ongoing marriage and sexual relations with a long deadpharaoh.We may want to consider Craddock in light of modern communications andinteractions, not only with the dead, but with extra-terrestrials, disincarnatebeings, daimons, and ascended masters. These have been related by intelligent,psychologically high-functioning individuals well regarded in their professionalfields, who attest to the reality, though not the provability, of their ownexperiences. Are these all hallucinations, insanity, or mere constructs of thehuman psyche? Or is there a distinct reality that exists along the borderlandsof our everyday existence?Ida Craddock believed that spirit bridegrooms and brides are much more frequentthan is generally supposed. So, whether this book encourages people to discusstheir own encounters more openly or to explore the considerable material nowavailable on sacred sexuality, Ida Craddock, through the grace of Vere Chappelland in adherence to the laws protecting freedom of speech, is again teaching\"the fundamental principles of sex morality on the Borderland.\" You have in yourhands a book that can provide you with a map to that territory and a descriptionof what Craddock found to be its greatest perils and safeguards.Mary K.

She hadalready been arrested in Philadelphia, Chicago, and Washington, DC. Here in NewYork, she had endured three months in the workhouse on Blackwell's Island, anordeal that almost killed her. Now, at forty-five years old, she had beenconvicted once again. The next morning, she was due to appear in court to facesentencing for her crime. But she wasn't about to let that happen. Her thingswere all packed—her books, some clothes, and her most valuable possession: awell-used Remington typewriter. She could always leave, making her way toCalifornia, or perhaps back to London where she had escaped once before, safelyout of the reach of the agents of the American Inquisition, who would not restuntil she was silenced for good. She had been a fugitive before; she knew how toelude the police, the private detectives, and the men from the asylum. But whatgood would it do? She thought about the offenses for which she had been convicted. She was adanger to public morals, they said. A threat to the nation's youth. Not in herright mind. But they didn't understand. She had a gospel to preach—a message ofbeauty, joy, and spiritual enlightenment. So much pain and suffering could beeased, so much ignorance and bitterness could be avoided, if only she wereallowed to share her teachings with the world. The world badly needed them, ofthat there was no doubt.She looked at her image in the mirror: her long blond hair primly done up in abun; her alabaster complexion, determined brow, and clear blue eyes. She wascertain that her motives were pure. She stood for moral correctness, rightliving, and clear thinking—never hedonistic indulgence or uncontrolled passion.Hundreds had benefited from her instruction. She had been praised by doctors andclergymen alike, all of whom attested to the value of her writings. But becauseher subject was sex—only within marriage, of course—she was accused of beingobscene, lascivious, lewd, and dirty, if not insane.She knew what she had to do. They must not be allowed to silence her. Herprecious manuscripts had already been sent away for safekeeping, where noone—not even her mother—would be able to find and destroy them. Someday, whenthe American public was ready, they would be published. But, in the meantime,she would make her case to the people, and ensure that her side of the storywould be told. For the last time, she rolled a sheet of paper into her trustyRemington and began to type.As the morning dawned, Ida Craddock carefully disconnected the hose from her gasstove and opened the jet. Lying back on her bed, she took the razor she hadprepared and drew it across her wrist, just to be sure. As her awareness beganto fade, she was not afraid, for she could already see her spirit companionsgathering to meet her on the other side of the Borderland. Soon she would befree."},{"pageContent":"AMERICAN SPIRITUALITY AT THE TURN OF THE CENTURY America in the late 19th century was undergoing a period of rapid social change.The country was buffeted by a series of interrelated movements advancing newreligious, sexual, and political ideas. Some were more popular than others, andmany were more widely known for their radicalism than for their mainstreamappeal; but all had an impact on the collective public psyche, setting the stagefor yet more dramatic changes to follow at the turn of the century. Spiritually, America was in the midst of the Third Great Awakening, a period ofintense religious activity.2 With it came a renewed enthusiasm for evangelicalProtestantism and moral reform, which in turn spawned \"social purity\"initiatives and \"clean living\" organizations like the Young Men's ChristianAssociation (YMCA) and the Women's Christian Temperance Union (WCTU). Bothgroups had active political agendas that called for the prohibition of alcoholand the regulation of sexual behavior; both were widely influential.At the same time, more liberal manifestations of the Third Great Awakening arosein the form of new religious movements like Christian Science, Divine Science,and New Thought. Although nominally Christian, they introduced new beliefs thatemphasized the immanence of spirit and the ability of the mind to heal the body.Other spiritual groups springing from this fertile period included those withUtopian visions, like the Brotherhood of New Life established by Thomas LakeHarris in Fountain Grove, California and the Oneida Community founded by JohnHumphrey Noyes in upstate New York, both of which incorporated nontraditionalmarriage and sexual practices.Spiritualism was another pervasive influence throughout the last half of the19th century. The primary feature of Spiritualism was communication with thespirits of the dead, which usually took place during a séance in the form oftable turning, table rapping, automatic writing, or speaking through a medium.The Ouija board, or planchette, was also a favorite Spiritualist instrument.Introduced in 1848, Spiritualism rapidly gained in popularity after the CivilWar, when a grieving nation was eager to establish contact with its huge numberof dead husbands, fathers, and sons. It was by no means a fringe movement;séances were held even in the White House and attended by Abraham Lincoln.Spiritualism also assumed a political dimension because most mediums were women,affording them unprecedented standing as spiritual leaders within theircommunities. Thus it naturally became aligned with causes associated withwomen's rights.Related to, but distinct from, Spiritualism was a rise in organized occultism.The most successful metaphysical organization of the period was the TheosophicalSociety, founded in New York in 1875 by the spiritualistic medium HelenaPetrovna Blavatsky, along with Henry S. Olcott and William Q. Judge. Otheroccult groups, like the Triplicate Order founded in 1874 by Paschal BeverlyRandolph and the Hermetic Brotherhood of Luxor founded in 1884 by PeterDavidson, Thomas Burgoyne, and Max Theon, also had esoteric sexual teachings.Coincident with this explosion of spiritual activity was an increasing amount ofdiscourse on sexual activity. The new science of sexology had just beenestablished in Europe, and the groundbreaking works of sexologists Richard vonKrafft-Ebing and Havelock Ellis were best-sellers in the United States. Themedical profession began to regard \"the sex question\" as part of its domain,competing with the clergy who had hitherto held a monopoly on sexual matters,considered to fall within their moral purview. Meanwhile, Hargrave Jennings andothers had demonstrated that the origins of modern religion could be traced toancient phallic and sex worship, influencing the doctrines of the occultists andtitillating the public.All of these trends were reflected in the political activism of the day. TheFreethought movement emerged to counter sectarianism and the repression of thesocial purity crusades by supporting free speech, especially in matters ofreligion and morality. The Free Love movement went a step beyond this andadvocated the reform of patriarchal marriage and divorce laws. Social hygieneproponents sought to accomplish the same goals espoused by social purityreformers—to reduce prostitution, venereal disease, and unwanted pregnancy—butfrom a medical, rather than moralistic, perspective. Women fought for dressreform, to shed the corsets of the Victorian era in favor of simpler and morecomfortable undergarments. Many of these movements were interrelated, andfactions within them sometimes were split over a single issue.At the nexus of all of these trends—spiritual, sexual, and political—was aremarkable woman named Ida C. Craddock. She was a Spiritualist and aFreethinker, a proponent of New Thought and Divine Science, an occultist and anactivist. She advocated free speech but not free love, social purity but notmoral asceticism, social hygiene but not artificial birth control. In some ways,she appeared to be a paradox: rational and scientific, yet spiritual andreligious.3 She was progressive on many issues, especially those relating tosexual and social reform, and yet uncompromisingly conservative on others—forexample, maintaining that marriage was the only permissible context for sexualactivity. But she was neither confused nor ambivalent; she had very definite andwell-justified beliefs, and a strong sense of personal morality. Her activitieseventually brought her squarely into conflict with the law, but she held fast,motivated by her conviction that her efforts served a higher purpose and agreater good. To sacrifice her life for these principles was entirely consistentwith her idealism. Although her suicide was tragic in its necessity, it wasultimately triumphant in achieving its purpose.Ida's father, Joseph T. Craddock, was born in Maryland in 1817. Although raiseda Quaker, at some point he appears to have repudiated the faith of his familyand become non-religious. He was an inventor, holding two U.S. patents forimprovements to the process of refrigeration. At the age of twenty-two, hemarried Mary J. Crow, also twenty-two, and they had four children: Rebecca,Edwin, William, and Joseph Jr. Mary died tragically in 1852 at the age ofthirty-five. Perhaps it was this cruel twist of fate that led Joseph to abandonhis belief in a personal, benevolent God.Two years later, Joseph married twenty-one-year-old Elizabeth \"Lizzie\" Selvage.Her origins are somewhat vague; census records list her as having been born ineither New Jersey or Maryland, and indicate that her parents had emigrated fromFrance. Joseph and Lizzie were married on April 27, 1854 at the First MethodistEpiscopal Church in Baltimore, but soon thereafter, they moved to Philadelphia.Their first child, Nana, died in infancy. Ida was born on August 1, 1857.Ida never knew her father. Joseph Craddock died of tuberculosis when she wasjust four months old. On his deathbed, he extracted a promise from Lizzie thatshe would not give Ida a religious upbringing. It was a promise that she wouldnot keep, however. Although Lizzie was a spiritualist and dabbled in séances andthe Ouija board, after Joseph died she became a devout evangelical Christian andeven served as treasurer of the WCTU in Philadelphia. She raised Ida withpuritanical discipline, giving her intensive religious training at home andlater sending her to a Quaker school. She also had an irritable temper, andsubjected Ida to physical punishment well into her twenties. Ida later recalledthat her mother \"instructed me carefully that I must never allow a man to kissme or put his arm around me, or even hold my hand.\"4 Lizzie, on the other hand,married again twice after Ida's father died: once to a man named Brown, and thento a man named Decker, whose name she kept for the remainder of her life.By her mother's account, Ida was a precocious child, already reading from theBible when she was two and a half years old, and able to write by the time shewas five. In spite of being a single parent, Lizzie was able to provide acomfortable standard of living for their household, which in 1860 consisted ofLizzie, age twenty-seven, Ida, age three, Ida's twenty-year-old half-sisterRebecca (from Joseph's previous marriage), an Irish maid, and a middle-agedfemale lodger. They also had a vacation cottage in New Jersey and a horse namedDaisy. Overall, Ida reported fond memories of her childhood, but her mother'sstrictness would remain a potent force throughout her life.Soon after Joseph's death, Lizzie founded a patent medicine business, Craddock &Co. Her sole product was a liquid preparation of Cannabis indica (Indian hemp),an early example of what we today call medical marijuana. It was advertised as acure for consumption (as tuberculosis was then called), the same disease thathad killed Ida's father. It was also marketed to treat \"bronchitis, nightsweats, irritation of the nerves, difficult expectoration, nausea at thestomach, and will break up a fresh cold in 24 hours\" according to oneadvertisement from a newspaper of the time.5 This business provided Lizzie witha steady source of income until about 1897.Image [images/00004.jpg]> Figure 1. Advertisement for Craddock & Co., from the Ida Craddock papers,> courtesy of SCRC. Upon reaching adulthood, Ida embarked upon her lifelong vocation as a writer andteacher. In 1878, at the age of twenty, she wrote a review of Goethe's Faustthat was published in the Saturday Evening Post. She also taught shorthand atGirard College in Philadelphia, and authored a textbook on the subject calledPrimary Phonography. Published in 1882, the book received favorable reviews inthe Post and the Atlantic Monthly. But even this seemingly innocuous occupationharbored seeds that would grow in significance later in her life.First was the fact that the standard method of shorthand Ida taught wasoriginally developed by Sir Isaac Pitman (1813–1897), who happened to be amember of the New Church founded by the Swedish mystic Emmanuel Swedenborg(1688–1772). It seems a bit more than coincidence that several prominentadvocates of sexual reform were also practitioners of stenography, includingStephen Pearl Andrews6 and Henry Parkhurst.7 Another synchronicity arose from acontroversy in 1888 over the fact that Girard College provided religiousinstruction to its students, in violation of the conditions set forth in thewill of its founder, Stephen Girard.8 The primary instigator of this protest wasRichard B. Westbrook,9 who was later to become Ida's employer and a significantinfluence on her life.By the time she was twenty-five years old, Ida had already begun to challengethe status quo. In 1882, she became the first woman to apply for admission tothe University of Pennsylvania. Although she passed the entrance examination andwas recommended for admission by the faculty, the board of trustees quicklypassed a resolution expressly prohibiting the admission of women, and Ida'sapplication was denied. This setback would later limit her opportunities topursue a career as a schoolteacher. Not having a college degree made it harderfor her to find work, but also probably contributed to the channeling of herenergies toward less conventional aspirations.In 1887, at the age of twenty-nine, Ida left home for the first time and movedto California, mainly to escape the overbearing attention of her mother. Shelived in the San Francisco Bay area for about two years, during which time sheworked as a bank clerk. She also taught typing and stenography classes at theWomen's Educational and Industrial Union, which was dedicated to improvingopportunities for a rapidly growing class of working women. In her spare time,she read the works of Laurence Oliphant10 and started attending a Unitarianchurch.Unitarianism was a breath of fresh air for Ida after her rigid evangelicalupbringing. The adult class that she attended at the church each week broadenedher horizons and challenged her intellect. She wrote: \"I have never yet been inany class or club that went quite fast enough for me . . . and I have alwayslonged to be thrown with a set of people where I should have to work to keep upwith the others, rather than have to restrain my steps to hold back with them.Now, at last, I am thrown with such a set of people.\"11 They studied such worksas Herbert Spencer's Principles of Psychology and had lively and spiriteddiscussions. As a result, she continued, \"not only is my horizon of scientificknowledge widening; not only is my mode of thinking becoming more consecutiveand logical; but my sense of the nearness of God, of the truth of the assertionthat in him we live and move and have our being, grows daily more vivid.\"12In 1889, she took a month-long vacation to Alaska, which refreshed andinvigorated her. Her encounters with the native art and culture prompted her towrite an article on phallic symbolism in Alaskan mythology, although themagazine to which she submitted it had to edit it heavily for publication. Thiswork marked the beginning of her enduring interest in sexual customs and theirreligious implications. Now all she had to do was find an outlet for itsexpression.An opportunity would soon present itself.2 Historians have denoted several periods of American religious revival as\"Great Awakenings.\" The First Great Awakening, circa 1730–60, was characterizedby a rise in Congregationalism. The Second Great Awakening occurred around1800–1840 and saw the birth of the Mormon and Seventh Day Adventist churches.The Third Great Awakening began around 1850 and continued into the early 1900s.See Robert William Fogel, The Fourth Great Awakening & the Future ofEgalitarianism (Chicago: University of Chicago, 2000). 3 This apparent paradox is resolved by the principle of \"Scientific Illuminism\"described by Aleister Crowley as \"the Method of Science, the Aim of Religion.\"See Egil Asprem, \"Magic 'Naturalized'? Negotiating Science and Occult Experiencein Crowley's Scientific Illuminism,\" Aries, vol. 8, no. 2, 2008. 4 Quoted by Theodore Schroeder, \"The Religious Erotism of Ida C.\" (SCRC, 1930). 5 Today the original Craddock & Co. medicine bottles are collector's items,commanding prices of $200 or more. 6 Stephen Pearl Andrews (1812–1886) was an American attorney, abolitionist, andfounder of the Free Love League. He invented the word \"scientology\" in 1871,long before it was taken up by L. Ron Hubbard. 7 Henry Martyn Parkhurst (1825–1908) was a professor of astronomy whose writingson male sexual continence would later influence Ida's ideas about sexualmysticism. 8 Stephen Girard (1750–1831) was an American banker and philanthropist, and thewealthiest man in the country at the time of his death. In his will, he endowedGirard College as a boarding school for poor white orphan boys in grades 1–12. 9 Richard Brodhead Westbrook (1820–1899), an attorney and ex-clergyman, was theauthor of Girard's Will and Girard College Theology (1888). 10 Laurence Oliphant (1829–1888) was a British author, traveler, and mystic. Hewas a follower of Thomas Lake Harris (1823–1906), American spiritualist andfounder of the Utopian Brotherhood of the New Life, which taught unorthodoxsexual doctrines. 11 Letter from Ida Craddock to Katie Wood, December 8, 1887, SCRC. 12 Letter from Ida Craddock to Katie Wood, December 8, 1887, SCRC. "},{"pageContent":"> CHAPTER 1BELLY DANCING IN CHICAGO Chicago was abuzz with excitement in 1893. Three years earlier, the city hadnarrowly beaten New York to be chosen as the site of the World's ColumbianExposition, popularly known as the World's Fair. After twenty-six months offeverishly paced construction, at a cost of over $18 million (an astronomicalsum at that time, equivalent to about $17 billion today), the fair finallyopened to the public on May 1, 1893. In sheer size and grandeur, it was withoutprecedent, and it would not be surpassed for years to come. Covering over 600acres of mostly reclaimed land on the shore of Lake Michigan south of the city,it encompassed 200 purposebuilt structures—pavilions for the exhibits andconcessions—set among meticulously landscaped gardens, artificial lakes, canals,and islands. In the short six months of its operation, the fair drew in morethan 27 million visitors, equal to about half the U.S. population at the time.It was a monumental achievement. Among the many attractions of the fair, the promenade extending west from itsentrance, called the Midway Plaisance, was undoubtedly the most colorful andexciting. This area was leased to private concession operators for carnivalrides, sideshows, food stands, and other amusements. \"The Midway,\" as it came tobe known, was home to the first Ferris wheel, built on a colossal scale—at over260 feet high, it had thirty-six Pullmansized carriages that could carry sixtypeople each. Other popular venues included Buffalo Bill Cody's Wild West Showand the nation's first commercial movie theater.Sexual Outlaw, Erotic Mystic In keeping with the international character of thefair, many of the Midway attractions were modeled after exotic locales. Therewere Chinese, Javanese, Aztec, and Turkish villages; a Moorish palace, an Indianbazaar, and a Persian theater; and scale models of the Eiffel Tower and St.Peter's Basilica. Occupying a prominent spot in the shadow of the Ferris wheel(near the intersection of what is 59th Street and University Avenue today), the\"Street in Cairo\" entertained visitors with a chaotic mix of astrologers,conjurers, snake charmers, and trained monkeys. But its most famous—and mostcontroversial—attraction was a show called the \"Danse du Ventre\" (French,literally \"dance of the abdomen.\") This was America's introduction to the art ofMiddle Eastern dance, destined to become known simply as \"belly dancing.\"Image [images/00005.jpg]> Figure 2. A performer of the Danse du Ventre, from Halsey C. Ives, The Dream> City: a Portfolio of Photographic Views of the World's Columbian Exposition> (St. Louis: N. D. Thomson Co., 1893). By today's standards, the show was downright tame. No bare midriff or flash ofthigh could be seen; the dancers wore ankle-length skirts with muslin trousersunderneath, and ample chemises that fully covered their torsos, arms, andshoulders. But it wasn't what they displayed, it was how they displayed it thatcaused such a sensation in 1890s America. The provocative undulations of theperformers' waists and hips, and the deliberate sensuousness of their movements,fascinated even as it scandalized the public. The Danse du Ventre quickly becameone of the fair's most popular draws.The performance also drew the attention of Anthony Comstock (1844–1914),self-appointed guardian of American public decency. In 1873, Comstock foundedthe New York Society for the Suppression of Vice (NYSSV), a private moralenforcement squad that was spun off from the YMCA and funded by a cadre ofwealthy conservative businessmen, including J. Pierpont Morgan and SamuelColgate. After intense lobbying by Comstock, Congress passed a law aimed at thesuppression of \"obscene literature and articles of immoral use,\" which becameknown as the Comstock Law after its chief proponent and enforcer. This law madeit illegal to send any \"obscene, lewd, or lascivious\" materials through the U.S.mail, including contraceptive devices and any information concerning sex, birthcontrol, or abortion.13 [index_split_012.html#filepos100177] Many statesfollowed suit by passing their own versions of the Comstock Law.Although he was not a government employee, through his influence in CongressComstock was able to obtain an appointment as a volunteer postal inspector thatallowed him to conduct investigations, order arrests, and seize and destroymaterials he found objectionable. Since the postal service fell under federaljurisdiction, this gave Comstock broad powers to intercept, examine, andproscribe virtually anything sent through the mail, even personalcorrespondence. Along with a gang of private \"detectives\" in his employ, heoften used undercover sting operations and other subterfuges to gather hisevidence and secure legal convictions against those who dared to offend hissensibilities. Comstock boasted that he was responsible for 4,000 arrests andfifteen suicides over the course of his career. Among his earliest targets wasthe famous women's suffragist and free-love advocate, Victoria Woodhull.14[index_split_012.html#filepos100803]Image [images/00006.jpg]> Figure 3. Anthony Comstock (1844–1915), frontispiece from Anthony Comstock,> Fighter (1913). After viewing the Danse du Ventre for himself, Comstock deemed it \"distinctlyand disgustingly obscene\" and attempted to have it shut down. He appealed to theBoard of Lady Managers, an advisory group constituted to represent women'sinterests at the fair. Although the Board was not unanimously opposed to theperformance (one member insisted that it was \"very fascinating\"), theynevertheless lodged a formal complaint with the fair's director-general, GeorgeR. Davis. Davis immediately authorized an investigation. No doubt mindful of theshow's popularity, however, and the fact that the fair was still running in thered, he ultimately took no action against it. Meanwhile, Comstock took hiscampaign to the public, threatening to have the fair's commissioners indictedfor \"keeping a disorderly house,\" a charge usually reserved for those whomanaged houses of prostitution.The press had a field day with Comstock's absurd prudery. The August 5, 1893edition of the New York World quoted him fuming: \"It's got to stop. The wholeWorld's Fair must be razed to the ground or these [belly dancing] shows muststop. It is an assault upon the pure dignity of womanhood.\" The paper went on todescribe how Comstock, \"a pretty stout man,\" attempted to imitate the dance andnearly fell on his sofa instead. In an editorial on August 11th, the Worldsarcastically noted that the \"tears and virtuous indignation\" of the LadyManagers arose only after Comstock's arrival, when the fair was already halfover. And on the 13th, the World dedicated almost an entire page to letters ithad received in response to the controversy. Seven of these were from clergymen,most of whom supported Comstock's efforts, even though they had not seen theperformance themselves. The remaining two letters were from women, and thelongest letter of all, spanning almost two full columns, was from Ida Craddock.Comstock had provided just the opening she needed to introduce her ideas to thebroader public.Ida defended the Danse du Ventre as \"a religious memorial of a worship whichexisted thousands of years ago all over the world, and which taught self-controland purity of life as they have never been taught since.\" She went on todescribe the movements and attire of the dancers in detail, noting that evensuch elements as the number of tassels hanging from the dancers' costumes hadsymbolic meaning. Those who understood that meaning, she contended, would notmisinterpret the belly dance as immoral. She concluded with a direct challengeto Comstock:> To suppress this dance, as Anthony Comstock and others propose to do, strikes> a blow at social purity and at the diffusion of scientific truth. It is our> American men and women, and not the Oriental women, who are responsible for> the atmosphere of indecent suggestions surrounding the very mention of the> Danse du Ventre in the Midway Plaisance at the World's Fair. . . . Let the> real significance of this dance as a religious memorial of purity and> self-control be broadcast, so that Anthony Comstock and his helpers may be> enlightened on the subject and may refrain from their attacks on the Danse du> Ventre in the Cairo Theatre of the Midway Plaisance—attacks which, if> successful, will certainly blacken the cause of social purity for many a long> year to come.15 [index_split_012.html#filepos101216] Ida's challenge would not go unanswered. Anthony Comstock was apparently notenlightened on the subject. Although his attempts to suppress the dance itselfhad been fruitless, he now had a new target. When an expanded version of Ida'sletter was published in the medical journal Chicago Clinic, Comstock used hispowers as a volunteer postal inspector to declare the issue obscene, making it acrime to send it through the U.S. mail. Ida responded by typing up copies of the essay and offering them for saleherself, at fifty cents each. The notoriety generated by her public defiance ofComstock led to her making contact with like-minded supporters, among whom shefound ready customers for her work. In November 1893, she was invited to give alecture to the Ladies' Liberal League in New York, one of several organizationsin the burgeoning Freethought movement that opposed religious meddling inaffairs of state. The lecture was entitled \"Survivals of Sex Worship inChristianity and Paganism: What Christianity Has Done for the Marital Relation.\"She gave the same lecture again a few months later at the Manhattan LiberalClub, which also drew press coverage; the World's headline read \"A Very ShockingTime\" and said that the lecture was unprintable, albeit very well attended.16[index_split_012.html#filepos101477] A new phase of Ida's life had begun, onededicated to public activism.The essay presented here is reproduced from one of Ida's self-published copies.It was expanded significantly beyond the edited letter that appeared in theWorld, and quoted other letters in support of the dance that appeared in thesame issue of the paper. In this version, Ida elaborates on the symbolism of thesix tassels on the dancer's costume as representing the five days of a woman'smenstrual cycle, plus a sixth day for the resumption of sexual intercourse. Shealso discusses at some length the practice of \"male continence\" (ejaculatorycontrol) as taught by John Humphrey Noyes, founder of the Oneida Community inupstate New York. In the methods of the Danse du Ventre, Ida found what shebelieved to be the female counterpart of male continence, a method by whichwomen could effect their own sexual self-control. These principles became thebedrock upon which all her future works (and personal practice) were based. Heressay, \"The Danse du Ventre,\" is especially significant as her firstarticulation of these principles in printed form. It is also Ida's firstpublished admission of her marriage to a spirit husband, a bombshell that shecasually drops in the very last paragraph."},{"pageContent":"THE DANSE DU VENTRE (DANCE OF THE ABDOMEN) AS PERFORMED IN THE CAIRO STREETTHEATRE, MIDWAY PLAISANCE, CHICAGO: ITS VALUE AS AN EDUCATOR IN MARITAL DUTIES17(1893) The Danse du Ventre in the Cairo Street Theatre of the Midway Plaisance, at theWorld's Fair, Chicago, has been so little understood by the crowds that haveflocked to see it, that it is usually spoken of as demoralizing. On thecontrary, it is a strictly moral dance in its significance. It is a religiousmemorial of a worship that existed thousands of years ago, all over the world,and which taught self-control and purity of life as they have never been taughtsince. We have travelled fast and far since those old uplifting days of Phallicor Sex Worship. That worship, the vehicle of moral and social teaching to allhumanity, at length became corrupt, through causes which it is unnecessary tomention here, and was gradually displaced by Sun Worship; this, in turn,yielding to Christianity in some portions of the world. We have gained much bythis religious evolution; but we have also lost something; and that something is(1) the clean-minded consideration of the human form divine, and (2) therecognition of sex as the chief educator of the human race in things materialand things spiritual. We have still something to learn from heathen nations inthese matters; and I, for one, rejoice that this Danse du Ventre should havebeen one of the appointed means of grace. But—but—but—why do people all say it is so demoralizing, and so disgusting, and. . .All people do not call it these things, my friend. Archbishop Corrigan,18 inreply, apparently, to a question asked of him by the New York World, gave hisopinion on the Danse du Ventre in the edition of Sunday, August 13th, asfollows: \"I presume that the dances in the Midway Plaisance which Mr. Comstockobjected to were national dances, and, as such, gave one an idea of the mannersand customs of the peoples. No doubt the poor creatures meant no harm by it andthought no wrong of it. They would hardly come so far to exhibit a performancethey were ashamed of. It is all in the way one looks at it. I should have goneto see it and would not have been scandalized, I believe. Perhaps Mr. Comstockwas too sensitive in the matter, he and the good old ladies who were so shocked.They might have seen worse dances of a Saturday night in New York, dances wherereal evil is meant. It will not do to criticize semisavages on the same basis asour high-toned American ladies and gentlemen.\"In the same issue of the World, Miss Loie Fuller,19 the serpentine dancer, spokein high terms of the artistic grace of this dance, which she had seen performed,not in Chicago, but in Paris (where, if anywhere, one might look for refinedimmorality). She thought that to those who wish it suppressed, the Venus of Milowould probably seem an equally fit subject for suppression. She adds: \"I am wellaware that dancing may be immoral and graceful and artistic at the same time;but the dancer whom I saw, who was said to be a very good and experienced one,impressed me only with her art. She really expressed thoughts and ideas in hergraceful pantomime . . . those zealots who are looking for suggestiveness woulddoubtless find it, but then people of that sort would doubtless find somethingsuggestive in the dainty raising of skirts in the stately minuet.\"I talked this summer with a commercial traveler who had been told by a friend:\"Now, you can look at that dance which you are going to see, in one of two ways.You can view it as a vulgar show, or you can view it as a presentation of theirreligion.\" This gentleman, while watching the dance, overheard another gentlemanexplaining to his wife that the dance was a religious memorial of ethicalteaching.The above were but a few of the numerous instances within my knowledge where theDanse du Ventre has been looked on as the reverse of impure.The Danse du Ventre (Dance of the Abdomen) is not a dance at all, as weunderstand the term. It consists mainly of swaying, undulating movements of thehips and contortions of the abdomen; and at first sight, one is lost inwonderment as to what it all means. But it is not long before most spectatorsrealize that it sets forth the movements of a passionate woman, elaborated,conventionalized into a series of rhythmic actions, and performed withdeliberation, in harmony with musical beats of time. The dance was usuallyperformed by one woman at a time, and consisted almost entirely in a slightswaying of the body from the pelvis as a fulcrum, with powerful contortions ofthe abdomen and undulations of the hips. That these contortions might be clearlyvisible to the spectators, the skirt band dipped in front to about the navel.The entire trunk and the arms were clothed in a netted silk undervest—no doubtin deference to the prejudices of an American audience—and the girl was adornedwith numerous bangles and neck chains looped over her bosom, and waist chainslooped over her abdomen. Ugly black stockings, high heeled slippers and widewhite muslin drawers reaching to the knee and visible under the short peasantskirt only at such rare times as the dancer whirled about quickly, completed thecostume. The lower limbs were distinctly uninteresting and unattractive, both incostume and attitude, thus differing from our ballet-dancers, whose limbs, as weknow, are always clothed so as to enhance the charm of graceful posturing.A universal adornment of those who danced (though sometime absent from theskirts of those who remained sitting cross-legged on the divan at the rear ofthe stage) was a number of tassels, hung each on a streamer that usuallyextended from the waist to the bottom of the skirt. In one or two instances, theside tassels lacked a streamer, and were suspended directly from the waist; butthese tassels, whether with or without streamers, were always on the dancer'sskirt, and played their part in accentuating her pelvic contortions andquiverings. These tassels (except in certain cases referred to farther on) wereinvariably six in number. Now, to a student of Phallic antiquities, these sixtassels are conclusive evidence of a memorial which, in all heathen lands,recognizes a prohibition laid upon the man not to approach the woman during hertapu20 time of five days monthly, and the rejoicing consequent upon the removalof that prohibition upon the sixth day, when Nature ensures that the woman shallbe most affectionate. This memorial, which, in one form or another, is universalin heathen countries, and which also exists among the Jews, emphasizes ateaching sadly needed in Christian countries to save amiable wives from theincessant demands of those husbands who respect no physical condition and nonight in the month—as every physician knows.In exceptional instances, the six tassels were lacking, only four or fivetassels of irregular length being worn, as if they were growing out, but had notyet finished growing—that is to say the sixth tassel and the sixth day ofrejoicing had not been reached. But in all these cases, the dancer had thewaistband of her skirt made of a coiled snake. The serpent is a well-knownPhallic symbol of the male organ; and where the tassels were not yet six innumber, the snake was shown coiled around the dancer, and not free to erect itshead until the sixth day comes, which is the day of rejoicing and union at theclose of the woman's monthly tapu of five days.A charming picture in Frank Leslie's Illustrated Weekly shows a dancing girlwith four short tassels in addition to the usual six tasseled streamers, or tenin all.21 It is possible (supposing the artist has represented the numbercorrectly) that this symbolizes the ten lunar months of gestation, during whichmodern and ancient sexology alike forbid sexual excitement to the mother. Here,too, the coiled snake occurs as the waistband of the skirt, showing that thephallic serpent is no more free to erect its head during gestation than duringthe five days of monthly tapu.The dancer held in each hand a castanet with a bell-like clapper, which she keptactively in motion—a symbol recognizable by any Phallic student as typifying theagitation of the female. These castanets seem to serve as a guide to themusicians to regulate the measures of the discordant wailings which theirinstruments produced, and which the Orientals call music. Usually she walkedslowly about on the stage as she contorted, pausing at intervals to perform someespecially complicated movement. At such times she often spoke to the musicians,to give them some direction about changing the measure, or to one of the otherwomen on the divan, or to some of her own people in the audience.One woman tried hard to captivate some of the male spectators, by smiling boldlyat one after the other; but the rest of the women danced modestly, and with aneye to the business of the stage only. This one would-be cajoler has beenemphatically condemned by every man with whom I have talked as being the onlyblemish on an otherwise pleasing entertainment. It is justice to the managementof Cairo Street to say here that she was, later on, sent back to Egypt, with oneor two other girls who had been found unsatisfactory.As the ardor of the dancer increased, the agitation of her castanet clapperswould likewise increase; sometimes, in her vehemence, she would throw hercastanets away entirely for several moments; at other times she would crouchnearly to the floor, or even sit on the floor for a moment, all the time keepingup her powerful movements of the hips and abdomen, and then, rising once more toher feet, resume her dance. Several times during the progress of the dance, shewould stand perfectly still for a moment, and then be seized (as was indicatedby the tremblings of her tasseled streamers) with a gentle agitation whichincreased in violence until it seemed as though she would become too muchexhausted to continue. But just as one may sometimes, in fording a stream, fearhe will be swept away, and yet, by a struggle, keep his footing and pass throughsafely to the other shore, to resume his journey, so this dancer was never quiteswept away by the final quiverings of her passion, but passed through withoutlosing her emotional balance, and continued her dance. And in this finalquivering of passion, which never wholly submerged her self-control, and throughwhich she passed mistress of herself, to resume her Danse du Ventre as before,is presented what was the great object of Phallic teaching in the ancient dayswhen Sex Worship was the uplifting religion of the whole world—the acquirementof absolute self-control in both men and women. The wise men of those days wellknew what our wise men either have forgotten or shrink from teachingpublicly—that the divine power who rules the world requires from us all, notasceticism, but the self-controlled and pleasurable use of every passion in Hisservice. This Danse du Ventre must have been, in its origin, a striking lessonto women, not only in their powers, but in their duty of self-control on thatsixth and most passionate day of all the twenty-eight, when tapu time is ended.It was easy to tell who among the spectators were unduly agitated by the sightof the Danse du Ventre, since these usually ejaculated \"disgusting,\" andprecipitately fled. But to those whose sexual self-control, or whose intelligentpurity, or both, enabled them to appreciate and enjoy the Danse du Ventre, itcould not help being a most valuable object lesson, since it was, so to speak,the apotheosis of feminine passion. And it was no doubt originally intended asan object lesson to women in what corresponds to the especial kind of malecontinence advocated alike by the ancient Sex Worship and by the most advancedsexology of today—i.e., the full control of the orgasm at supreme moments, sothat it may be enjoyed leisurely, and in absolute purity and self-control. Thuswomen, as well as men, were trained in that marital self-control which prolongedthe satisfaction of husband and wife for an hour or more, prevented the waste ofnervous tissue resulting from the orgasm, conserved their physical and mentalenergies, and united them more closely in bonds of affection and mutual respectthan is possible by any other method.In some cases, a woman danced with a huge bottle of water on her head, and withtwo crossed sabers, which she at intervals pointed against her breast or herabdomen. The cross was a well-known symbol, in nearly all lands, for thousandsof years before Christianity, of the union of man with woman, when Sex Worshipwas the uplifting worship of the whole world. She repeatedly struck the bottleof water with one of the sabers. This bottle, which thus remained erect upon herhead, despite the blows it received, and in spite of her multitudinouscontortions of body, is symbolical of the organ which never spills its creativewater of life, no matter how great the friction—that is, where the man hasacquired the ability to practice the controlled orgasm and the sustained thrill.It is, of course, possible that the religious meaning of this dance, and of thememorial of the six tassels on the dancer's skirt, may have long since beenforgotten by the Oriental women who dance, and by the Oriental men before whomthey perform—although the modest bearing of most of the Cairo Theatre troupe,and the studied intellectual presentation of the dance by their most finisheddancers, would indicate that a reverence, however vague, still attaches to it intheir minds. (In this, they are in striking contrast to their imitators in othertheaters on the Midway Plaisance, who present it as a meaningless muscularcontortion, and who, for the most part, wriggle and shake themselves through itas superficially as a child jingles off Shakespeare.) But in the days when thespectators knew what the six, or the ten, or the less than six tassels meant,and why the Danse du Ventre was prolonged (symbolically) through orgasm afterorgasm, without loss of energy, for an hour at a time, we cannot doubt that ittaught the man and the woman who witnessed or performed it, both theircapacities for conferring, and their duties toward one Belly Dancing in Chicago13 another in the relation of husband and wife, as no mere preaching, by thewisest of priests, could have taught them.Such a dance as the Danse du Ventre, therefore, was and is distinctly upliftingto those who witness it with a full knowledge of its meaning, for the followingreasons:First, it inculcates purity of thought toward the sexual relation, since themovements of the woman in this dance are performed modestly, and with no evidentattempt at lewdness, but merely as a natural and legitimate act which has beendeemed worthy of a clear and simple presentation, without comment, in a publicdance, where all may see its details.2nd. It teaches that prolonged pleasure goes hand-in-hand with sexualself-control.3rd. It teaches directly, by the six tassels on the dancer's skirt (or by thefewer number of tassels in connection with the waistband of the coiled serpent)the duty of respecting the woman's tapu period of five days monthly, since thesetassels, placed so conspicuously, are a memorial of rejoicing on the sixth day,when the prohibition is removed, and the man is once more free to approach thewoman. This prohibition is memorialized in all heathen beliefs, the world over,and also by the Jews. Christianity is the only religion within the writer'sknowledge which fails to memorialize in its symbolism some teaching, direct orindirect, to its young people, about the prohibited five-days period and othersexual obligations, thus leaving the prospective fathers of the race to pick upwhat knowledge they can, haphazard, mostly from prostitutes or depraved men ofthe world; and leaving the prospective mothers of the race to be trained on thewedding night by these male graduates from the school of impurity. And here,also, we can learn something from this dance of heathen women; since, as I havealready said, nearly every physician knows of a brute or unthinking husband, forthe lack of this training of respecting five nights out of every twenty-eight asfree from his approach. A physician lately told me that he knows of aflourishing house of prostitution in Philadelphia, whose proprietor isaccustomed to regularly notify certain male patrons in New York of the monthlyillness of any of the women, as these New York men will come over from that cityon purpose at such times.Sexual Outlaw, Erotic Mystic 4th. The picture given in Frank Leslie'sIllustrated Weekly would indicate, as I have already shown, that the ten lunarmonths (forty weeks) of gestation are also memorialized by this dance, as beinga time when sexual excitement is forbidden to the mother—a most wiseprohibition, which cannot be too clearly presented as the duty of every womangreat with child.5th. The Danse du Ventre trains the muscles of the woman in the endurancedesirable in the wife whose husband has acquired the ability to practice thecontrolled orgasm and the sustained thrill, and therefore increases hercapacity, not only for receiving, but also for conferring pleasure.6th. The Danse du Ventre teaches that the controlled and directed orgasm may bepassed through without loss of nervous energy; and it thus conveys a hygieniclesson, which people in general would be better physically for knowing.7th. Most important of all, the Danse du Ventre, if practiced by husband andwife in accordance with its true interpretation, would do away with the horrorsof accidental or forced maternity, and without, on the other hand, violating thenatural law by putting asunder those whom God hath joined together as husbandand wife. That is to say, while it insures that children cannot be bornaccidentally, it requires no unnatural self-denial or sinful modes ofprevention, but permits the freest possible intercourse in the marital relation,prolonging the physical and spiritual bliss of both parties. I say spiritualbliss advisedly, since it would appear that the controlled orgasm and thesustained thrill reach their perfection between husband and wife only when anatmosphere of mental purity and aspiration to the highest obtains during theentire progress of the orgasm.As to whether the Danse du Ventre practiced between husband and wife injures thehealth, I would refer the reader to the report made in the New York MedicalGazette by Dr. Theodore R. Noyes concerning statistics of nervous diseases inthe Oneida Community.22 The Oneida Community, as is well known, was managed from1848 until 1879 under some peculiar social laws, one of which included theuniversal practice of male continence,23 except when the Community haddistinctly authorized the creation of a child by a picked man and woman of thesociety. Their social custom further included one of what Appleton'sEncyclopedia terms \"community of women\"—regulated, to some extent, by ordinance.This latter custom was finally frowned down by clergymen and others in thedistricts adjoining the Oneida Community, and abolished. As to the practice ofmale continence, however, it is said that \"all the best members hold it in highhonor and are faithful to it\" today. And for at least thirty years previous tothe giving up of their system of \"community of women,\" male continence (which,as John Humphrey Noyes taught it, is physiologically the same thing as the Dansedu Ventre) was the almost universal practice, the main exceptions being youthswho had not yet acquired self-control, and who were therefore forbidden to matewith any woman who had not passed the child-bearing age, as the communitydesired that all its children should be the result, not of accident, but ofintention. Professor Goldwin Smith said of the children born of these unions:\"They are a fine, healthy-looking, merry set\";24 and this opinion is borne outby other writers.Concerning the health of the Community at large, John Humphrey Noyes writes:> The New York Medical Gazette of October, 1870, in a review of our article on> Scientific Propagation published in the Modern Thinker of that year, took> occasion to criticize our practice of Male Continence as likely to prove> injurious . . . and expressed a wish to see the statistics of nervous diseases> in the Community. Whereupon a professional examination was instituted and a> report made by Theodore R. Noyes, M.D., in which it was shown, by careful> comparison of our statistics with those of the U.S. census and other public> documents, that the rate of nervous diseases in the Community is considerably> below the average in ordinary society. This report was published by the> Medical Gazette, and was pronounced by the editor \"a model of careful> observation, bearing intrinsic evidence of entire honesty and impartiality.\"> > It was, however, admitted in that report that there had been one or two cases> of nervous disorder in the Community, which could be traced with probability> to a misuse of Male Continence in the way suggested by the Gazette; and I will> here take occasion to add that I have no doubt the greatest danger attending> the practice of Male Continence is, the temptation to make a separate hobby of> it, and neglect the religious conditions out of which it originally issued and> to which it belongs. Male Continence in its essence is self-control, and that> is a virtue of universal importance. To cultivate self-control in respect to> the seminal crisis, but neglect it in other sexual indulgences, is evidently> Male Continence in a spurious and dangerous form. It is certain that this> spurious self-control may be cultivated for the purpose of gaining freedom for> sexual and riotous pleasure.

Nothing less than> heart-abandonment to the grace of God, which teaches and gives temperance in> all things, can ever release us from the old tutelage of suffering. Our theory> in its oldest form defined the sexual organs as conveyances, not only of the> seed, but of the \"social magnetism.\" Now it is certain that the social> magnetism is a vital element, as real as the seed, and as really limited in> its supply; and that the loss of it in excessive quantities entails diseases> as atrocious as those which follow seminal waste, and to this liability women> are as much exposed as men.25 The pamphlet from which I quote the above details the philosophy and method ofmale continence. It is written from such a high and pure standpoint that I wishevery man in the country could read and ponder over its teachings.The plain teachings of that pamphlet to men, however, need to be supplemented byequally plain teachings to women. It is with this end in view that I havewritten this little pamphlet, as an entering wedge for detailed scientificinstruction from those sexologists who are more widely conversant with thematter than I.It is usually assumed that propagation is nature's only reason for man and womanentering into marital relations; whatever physical pleasure accrues therefrombeing looked on as merely a bait to propagation, and as at least a sensual, ifnot positively impure indulgence. But Noyes clearly shows in the pamphlet abovereferred to, that there are two distinct functions concerned in thoserelations—the social and the propagative—and that the sexual union of husbandand wife is for the purpose, not alone of perpetuating the species, but of\"giving a medium of magnetic and spiritual interchange.\" It is this possibilityof the twain becoming one flesh by being welded through their sexual relationsinto a spiritual union, which lifts husband and wife above the merely physicalrelations which obtain among animals. In such a spiritual and magnetic union,strengthened in each meeting in accordance with the principles of the Danse duVentre and of Male Continence, children will not be produced until the parentsare ready for them, and can beget them under the best conditions. In savage orsparsely settled countries, or in countries frequently depopulated by war, it isperhaps well to urge wholesale propagation, but in countries and civilizationslike ours, the need is not for quantity, but quality. Every woman knows, whenshe stops to think about it, that to create a child by accident, and carry itfor nine months in the womb of an unwilling mother—a mother who perhaps hates itfor coming—is a sin, not only against the moral law, but also against thecommunity into which that unwelcome comer, cursed before its birth withundesirable traits, is to be introduced. But, on the other hand, it isunreasonable to expect married people who are true lovers to abstain fromintercourse. And if intercourse be considered sinful between them, save forpurposes of child-bearing, unduly large families will result, as is so often thecase with ministers and other pious and well-meaning people. The device mostfrequently relied upon to prevent conception—abstaining from intercourse untiltwo weeks after the menses—is a sin against nature (and therefore, to trulydevout men and women a sin against God) since the day after the menses is theproper time of all times for intercourse, it being the period when the woman ismost affectionate and most passionate. The husband who allows this naturalwedding-night to go by, and who approaches his wife two weeks later, need notwonder if she feels disgust, instead of tender passion, at being compelled toreceive him only when she has least inclination to be approached. The practiceof the Danse du Ventre, however, disposes of these objections.The method of training in this, as in most things, consists in attempting it byslow degrees; going to the verge of orgasm, and resolutely stopping there, timeafter time, until one is able to suppress it altogether at will. Then, and notuntil then, may one attempt to enter that state of ecstasy with any expectationof controlling it. On one point I cannot be too emphatic. Unless the attempts atsuppressing and finally controlling the orgasm be made throughout in a mood ofaspiration to the highest, there will not be complete satisfaction, nor will theecstasy result in the twain becoming one in flesh and one in spirit. If youbelieve in Jesus, aspire to be in unison with his will from the moment theecstasy sets in; if you believe only in God the Father, aspire in joy andthankfulness to him; if you are an Atheist, aspire to be in harmony with the Lawof the Universe. If, however, you look on such advice as religious cant, thenthink and talk with your partner of poetry, sculpture, good books, plans forhelping other people, etc.; in short, strive then, of all times in your life, toenter into harmonious relations with the ideal, the generous and the pureoutside and beyond the act, if you would consummate it in its perfection.The ancients were right when they recognized the union of man with woman as areligious, but not necessarily a propagative act. Cupid, the God of Love, was achild—passion-inspiring but non-creative. His antitype is found in the famousMannekin Pis statue of Brussels (whose phallus serves as the conduit andgargoyle of a drinking fountain); in the Christ-Child on his folklore side; inthe boy-saint, Nicholas,26 etc.—all of them bestowers of abundance, butnon-creative as a little child. In Matthew 19, after a long and earnest talk onmarriage duties, Jesus finishes by commending those who make themselves eunuchsfor the kingdom of heaven's sake, adding, significantly, \"He that is able toreceive it, let him receive it.\"27 St. Origen and several other early Christiansinterpreted this text to mean literally castration; and they accordinglymutilated themselves, apparently not noticing that among those to whom Jesusreferred as making themselves eunuchs \"for the kingdom of heaven's sake\" he didnot include those who were made \"eunuchs for men.\" But the Danse du Ventrerenders it possible for men to carry out the recommendation of Jesus withoutunnatural mutilation.A great deal of sentiment is talked about \"sexual purity.\" But it rarely seemsto occur to anyone that purity means absence from material as well as moraluncleanness, and that the sexual act, as usually performed, is anything butcleanly. This objection does not apply when husband and wife perform the Dansedu Ventre. The wasteful scattering of seed where no sowing is intended, and theconsequent wanton drain on the male energies, is something against which everywife who ever hopes to be a mother should protest on behalf of the children whomshe expects one day to bear to her husband.So far from suppressing the Danse du Ventre, we should have it performed far andwide throughout our country, accompanied by an explanation of its symbolism ofpurity and self-control, as a prenuptial educator of our young people in themarital duties which they are about to assume. This dance is a bit of the oldpure and uplifting Sex Worship preserved by God's grace through the barbaric andcorrupt customs intervening between prehistoric times and now. Let us rejoicethat He who doeth all things well has preserved for this nineteenth century—whenthe facts of heredity and the claims of a future generation are brought to ournotice—this memorial of the Danse du Ventre, which, rightly understood andpracticed between man and wife, will purify the marital relation, and render itimpossible for any child to come into this world through an accident ofsensuality. Should it be objected that sensualists would then choose the Dansedu Ventre always for its physical pleasure and to escape having children, Ianswer, so much the better! The intelligent, the devout, the well-orderedclasses will not fail to propagate when they are free to use the time andenvironment (inasmuch as children are dear to all but the sensualist), and thehuman race will then be the gainer, since those only who realize their duty toGod and humanity will seek to perpetuate the species, and intending parents willthen select the most favorable conditions under which to propagate. Moreover,those who seek only sensual enjoyment, instead of the affectional and spiritualbliss of wedded love, in the Danse du Ventre, will not find the game worth thecandle, since the Danse du Ventre between man and woman can be practicedsuccessfully only in an atmosphere of mental purity and spiritual uplifting.There are, then, three reasons for practicing the Danse du Ventre between manand wife: First. No child can be born by accident. Second. The physical enjoyment is moreprolonged and intense than in the ordinary way. Third. In order that the Dansedu Ventre may be enjoyed in its perfection, it must be practiced throughout inan atmosphere of clean thoughts and aspiration to the highest, thus purifyingthe fountains of life at their very source, and educating those who practicethis method to become worthy creators of the children who may be born from theirloins. To all those, then, who value marital purity, wedded happiness and the bearingof children into the world under the most suitable conditions, I commend thestudy of the Danse du Ventre, in its pure aspect of an educator and uplifter tothat ideal sexual life which is the only one that is in accordance with naturaland divine law. I would say that I speak from the standpoint of a wife.My husband, however, is in the world beyond the grave, and had been for manyyears previous to our union, which took place in October, 1892. In accordancewith angelic laws, he can come clearly to me when I keep the way of right livingand clear thinking. Since right living cannot coexist with a sexual intercoursewhich is uncontrolled—as I have endeavored to show throughout this pamphlet—weare both of us compelled to carry out those principles of ideal maritalrelations which are taught by the symbolism of the Danse du Ventre. How far thereader may value my testimony as being the result of my personal experience, hewill decide of course according to his bias for or against the possibility ofcommunicating with our deceased friends beyond the grave. However, whether mypsychical experience be a fact or a hallucination, I can truthfully say that Ihave gained from it a knowledge of sexual relations which many years of readingand discussions with other people never brought me. But I do not relyexclusively on my own experience with my spiritual husband for authority. Thestatements in this pamphlet regarding the Danse du Ventre are amply borne out bythe testimony, both of books, and of men and women whose earnest seeking for thebetter way is undoubted.13 [index_split_011.html#filepos53695] This law is still on the books andenforced today.

"},{"pageContent":"> CHAPTER 2SPIRITUAL UNION At the end of \"The Danse du Ventre,\" Ida anticipated a potential objection toher work: how could she write knowledgably about sex if she were unmarried? In19th-century America, this would either mean that she had no sexual experience,which would diminish her credibility, or that she had had illicit (premarital)sexual relations, which would damage her reputation and undermine her moralstanding to speak as an authority on such matters. She answered this concern byinforming her readership that she was indeed married, to a husband \"in the worldbeyond the grave\" with whom she had regular sexual intercourse. Ida's first biographer, New York lawyer and free-speech advocate TheodoreSchroeder (1864–1953), believed that she had, by this time, gained sexualexperience in the material world as well, although Ida left no direct admissionof this in any of her surviving diaries or letters. Reading between the lines,Schroeder asserts that Ida had \"illicit relations\" with two different men before1892. The first was Euclid Frick, the son of a family friend, who was entrustedto her care during her move to California in the spring of 1887. He and Idalived together in a small house on 22nd Street in Oakland. Ida was working as abank clerk while the younger man attended medical school. In a letter to herlife-long friend, Katie Wood, dated December 8, 1887, Ida reported that she hadno other friends or social life outside of her relationship with Euclid, and yetshe \"never was so happy in my life as I am now.\" She also admitted that she feltsecure not having to sleep there alone, although whether this meant \"in the samebed\" or \"in the same house\" is a matter of conjecture. Eventually, Euclidgraduated and married another woman, and Ida returned to Philadelphia. Later inher life, Ida would write that she and Euclid were good friends \"in a brotherlyand sisterly way,\" but contended that \"there was never the slightest exchange ofcaresses between us\"—a bit too insistently in Schroeder's estimation.28[index_split_019.html#filepos435433]The second source of Ida's earthly sexual experience was identified by Schroederonly as an \"ex-clergyman and heretical mystic\" for whom Ida worked as asecretary after she returned from California in 1889. The name of this allegedlover has never before been divulged in print, but from the evidence, it iscertain that Schroeder was referring to Richard Brodhead Westbrook (1820–1899).Westbrook had been a Presbyterian minister, but became a lawyer and prominentFreethinker who challenged such Christian dogmas as the infallibility of theBible and the historicity of Christ. In the preface to the second edition of hisbook The Eliminator, he wrote:> There is indubitable evidence that this Christ character. . . was mainly> mythical, drawn from the astrological riddles of the older Pagan mythologies.> In fact, almost everything in Christianity seems to have been an afterthought.> It is the least original of any of the ten great religions of the world, and> the great mistake has been in making almost everything literal which the wise> men of ancient times regarded as allegorical.29> [index_split_019.html#filepos435731] Heretical indeed! In 1888, Westbrook was elected President of the AmericanSecular Union (ASU), a leading Freethought organization founded in 1876 as theNational Liberal League. The following year, at the ASU's thirteenth annualcongress in Philadelphia, Westbrook was re-elected President, and Ida waselected Secretary. It is during this period, according to Schroeder, that Idabegan a sexual relationship with her second lover. Unlike her previous companion, Westbrook was much older and more experienced. Hewas also an avid student of Eastern mysticism and had apparently mastered thepractice of prolonging intercourse without ejaculation. Schroeder speculatedthat, in contrast to her previous experience, his technique \"must have seemedwonderfully entrancing\" and induced in her \"extraordinary ecstasies.\"30[index_split_019.html#filepos436091] Soon afterward, Ida enthusiasticallyendorsed the method of male continence in \"The Danse du Ventre.\"Image [images/00007.jpg]> Figure 4. Richard B. Westbrook (1820–1899), president of the American Secular> Union, 1889–1891. Frontispiece from The Eliminator: Skeleton Keys to> Sacerdotal Secrets(1894). Westbrook and Ida resigned from the ASU in October of 1891, ironically becausethey disagreed with a faction of \"free-lovers\" within the organization whowanted the group to defend those who were being prosecuted for sending \"obsceneliterature\" through the mails. With the termination of their workingrelationship came the cessation of their intimacy as well.Ida's spirit husband arrived a year later. His name was Soph, and he was thespirit of a young man whom Ida had known when she was a teenager. He had been abusiness associate of her mother's and a frequent visitor to her household.During these visits he would always find some excuse to chat and joke with youngIda, and often gave her little presents. He died, however, before she reachedadulthood. Soon thereafter, Ida took up her mother's early interest inSpiritualism and began to experiment with Ouija boards and automatic writing.Eventually, as her mediumship abilities developed, she was able to make contactwith Soph once again. After a brief astral courtship, they were wedded in thespirit world.At first, she was tentative about revealing her new relationship. In a letter toa Freethought associate, she wrote:> The little paragraph pinned on the last page [of \"The Danse du Ventre\"] forms> no part of the essay. I merely send it out with the essay to such of my> friends and acquaintances as many be interested in knowing upon what authority> I, an unmarried woman, presume to express an opinion on the duties of the> marital relation.31 [index_split_019.html#filepos436386] She knew full well that such a claim would likely be greeted with skepticism,but she was unprepared for the response it provoked in those closest to her. Inearly 1894, after she prepared a lecture entitled \"Celestial Bridegrooms\" forthe Ladies' Liberal League, Westbrook secretly attempted to have the talkcancelled. Failing that, he instead addressed the assembled audience, disavowingher conclusions as \"unworthy of consideration,\" an act that left Ida\"exceedingly hurt.\"32 [index_split_019.html#filepos436836] Even worse was beingbetrayed by her own mother, who attempted to have her committed to an insaneasylum. She learned of the plot at the last minute and fled to the Westbrookresidence for sanctuary. Although Richard was fed up with her \"silly delusionsin regard to the Spirit Husband\"33 [index_split_019.html#filepos437375] andsought to distance himself from Ida, his wife, Henrietta,34[index_split_019.html#filepos437663] was sympathetic and took her in. After a brief stay with the Westbrooks, Ida escaped to New York under theprotection of a prominent Freethinker, E. B. Foote, Jr.35[index_split_019.html#filepos438063] But she soon learned that her mother washot on her trail, and had hired two men to abduct her and take her to an asylumagainst her will. With remarkable cunning, she arranged a series of false trailsto throw her mother off the scent, sending her luggage to Jersey City and makingarrangements to Spiritual Union 25 have her precious typewriter sent to Canada.She then redirected them under assumed names back to New York, from whence shecould collect them in time to leave the country. Meanwhile, she met with asympathetic colleague, the British journalist and spiritualist W. T. Stead,36[index_split_019.html#filepos438369] who was in New York on business. Afterhearing of her plight, Stead agreed to employ Ida as his research assistant, andarranged for her passage to England with him on the next steamer. They set sailjust ahead of the private investigators sent by Ida's mother to track her down.The ocean voyage was uneventful, but not until she had safely set foot onBritish soil did Ida finally breathe a sigh of relief.In London, Ida assumed the alias \"Mrs. Irene S. Roberts,\" and lived quietly byherself in a boarding house near Hyde Park. She spent much of her timeconducting research at the British Museum, with the support and encouragement ofStead. She also helped out at the offices of the Borderland and made use oftheir extensive library as well. It was during this period of refuge and studythat Ida wrote Heavenly Bridegrooms, beginning the manuscript on May 11, 1894.Heavenly Bridegrooms was Ida's attempt to justify her relationship with herspirit husband by demonstrating that her claim was by no means unique orhistorically unprecedented. She cited numerous Biblical and classical referencesto the phenomenon of intercourse between humans and angelic beings, not theleast of which was the Virgin Mary's impregnation with Jesus. The influence ofher research in the British Museum is evident in the many scholarly authoritiesfrom which she liberally quotes. She also drew upon a variety of spiritualistand occult sources, providing a little bit of something for everyone among herintended audience of \"Occultists, Freethinkers and Christians.\" The result wasan impressive and exhaustive proof that her experience was well-represented inthe recorded history and literature of mankind across many cultures and timeperiods.It would be easy to dismiss Heavenly Bridegrooms as an elaborate coverup for thelikelihood that Ida had already experienced sex in the conventional manner, andto suspect her spirit husband of being nothing more than a convenient fiction toexplain her illicitly-gained sexual knowledge. Ida herself acknowledged thepossibility that some of her readers would come to such a conclusion. To do so,however, would be erroneous. Ida kept detailed diaries of her spiritualexperiences from the spring of 1894 until the end of her life. These diariesdocument her conversations and other interactions with several distinctpersonalities whom she identifies as discarnate beings, including her husbandSoph. Her descriptions are clearly detailed, logically consistent, and evenlymatter-of-fact in tone. In the same entries, she also often recorded herdealings with the people around her and events in her daily life. She is able todistinguish clearly between these \"real world\" and \"spirit world\" occurrences,which happen with her fully conscious participation—as distinct from her dreams,which she also records. Her writing does not appear to be dissociative orfantastic, nor does it seem to degenerate in quality or temperament overhundreds of pages spanning a period of eight years. In short, thesepersonalities and her experiences with them were clearly an integral part of hersubjective reality, whether or not they can be considered objectively true. Herdiaries provide the best evidence that, even if she was in some way \"delusional\"in the conventional sense, she was neither lying nor clinically insane.37[index_split_019.html#filepos438691]Heavenly Bridegrooms is also significant in that it allows us to trace theevolution of Ida's principles of sexual mysticism. About midway through thetext, she asserts that one of the benefits of sexual intercourse, whether withan earthly partner or a heavenly one, is that it is \"the surest and safestmethod of seeking union with the Divine Heart of the Universe and becoming onewith all God's world.\" But to accomplish this, she explains, requires a programof strict training in self-control, divided into three degrees. Later, shedescribes these degrees, and promises that they will be elaborated upon furtherin a forthcoming treatise entitled \"Psychic Wedlock.\" We will take up thedetails of \"Psychic Wedlock\" in the next chapter, but in Heavenly Bridegrooms,we can discern many clues to the origin and development of its key points.The eight months during which Ida worked on the manuscript were intenselyproductive in a number of ways. Not only was she conducting historical researchat the museum and writing the text, she was also expanding her horizons on otherfronts. It was during this stay in London that she first made contact with theTheosophical Society, and expressed serious interest in receiving formaltraining in occultism. She also met other individuals from a variety ofbackgrounds, each of whom provided pieces of the overall puzzle as it tookshape. But she did not confine herself solely to abstract intellectual pursuits.She began earnest and diligent work on practical psychic development as well,undertaking experiments in automatic writing, meditation, levitation, crystalgazing, and divination with a Ouija board. On October 6, she wrote in her diary:> I have learned more from the Borderland library the past month and from Miss> X.38 [index_split_019.html#filepos439822] and the various books of the S.P.R.> and other occult works while in London, than I could have learned in five> years at home. I have dipped into Theosophy, Mysticism, Faith Cure, Christian> Science, Hypnotism, Crystal Gazing, Telepathy, et al., and have learned to> recognize the Power of Thought which is their great underlying principle. It> has been a wonderful training. Had I chosen, I could not have chosen one spot> in the world where I could have been so helped in my studies.> > During the whole time, she kept in constant contact with several spirit guides,conferring with and learning from them—and, at least in the case of her husband,Soph, having sex with them. She kept a detailed record of all of theseexperiences in her spiritual diary, which she evidently submitted to Stead forhis review; occasionally she would address him directly in an entry, to clarifya point or supply additional explanation. The most extraordinary feature of Ida's life with the spirits, of course, washer sexual contact with them. Rather than attempt to describe her experiences, Ishall provide a few quotes from her diary, verbatim:> Monday, May 21st, 1894.> > > > Last night, on retiring, my dear husband was with me as he has not been for> some time—I mean, in a different way—and we united sexually. I cannot describe> how happy I was to possess and be possessed by him. I felt as though I could> not give myself sufficiently to him.

Iason, the German physician,39> [index_split_019.html#filepos440203] assisted me, as he sometimes does, by> helping me to rotate and perform other abdominal movements, such as the girls> in the Danse du Ventre in the Cairo Theatre performed.

I cannot express the joy it is to be able to control one's self> just as one is going over the verge, and to realize in the same moment that> this prolonged union just as the spasm is about to begin is a delight to one's> partner.

And the joy of feeling—vague> as is my perception at present—that my partner is one with me in these things! Another important aspect of Heavenly Bridegrooms is that Ida considered it awork of semi-automatic writing—that is, a collaboration with one of her spiritguides, Iases, working through her. In her diary, she wrote that HeavenlyBridegrooms \"is much, much more due to his [Iases'] directing intellect than Ishould have ever dreamed possible for me as a psychic.\" The full entry isreproduced at the end of the text. Heavenly Bridegrooms is Ida's best-known work, thanks to the efforts of TheodoreSchroeder. Schroeder had never met Ida, but became interested in her case abouta decade after her death due to its significance in the history of the FreeSpeech movement. He began making inquiries and collecting documents, and waseventually able to retrieve the bulk of Ida's letters and manuscripts from theestate of W. T. Stead in England. Her story, and in particular HeavenlyBridegrooms, perfectly illustrated Schroeder's theories on what he called \"theerotogenesis of religion\"—that is, the sexual origin of religious phenomena. Hesubmitted Heavenly Bridegrooms, along with a short introduction, to thepsychological journal The Alienist and Neurologist in 1915. The journalpublished it over six issues between November 1915 and August 1917. It was thenreissued as a book in 1918, with the full title Heavenly Bridegrooms: AnUnintentional Contribution to the Erotogenetic Interpretation of Religion, by\"Ida C.\" The version presented here is based upon the proofs of the 1918 editionas hand-corrected by Schroeder, who added this explanatory note:> In the course of my studies on the erotogenesis of religion I became> interested in the life work and mental characteristics of one Ida C., a woman> who committed suicide in her forty-fifth year. I first heard of her after her> death, but it seemed to me that a psychologic study of her would yield rich> materials as a contribution to the psychology of religion. Consequently, I> bestirred myself to secure information, both biographical and> autobiographical. Among the materials gathered was her lifelong correspondence> with friends, a number of published essays written by her, some scraps of> manuscripts, and two completed but unpublished book manuscripts. This material> will later constitute the subject of my analysis. Ida C. was for a number of> years a college teacher and for a long time associated with various kinds of> free-thinking heretics. She was never married. In due time she became the> victim of erotic hallucinations to which she gave a \"spiritual\"> interpretation. Later, when her conduct brought her to the verge of> incarceration in a jail or in an asylum, she endeavored frankly to meet the> issue of her own insanity. The resultant investigation to her mind seemed a> complete vindication, not only of her sanity, but also, of the objective> reality and spirituality of her erotic experiences. This vindication she> reduced to writing. The manuscript is now in my possession. It seems to me> under the circumstances of this case and the future studies which I am going> to make, partly from other papers of the same author, that this is too> valuable a document to be mutilated by editing. Furthermore, others should be> given equal opportunity with myself in the interpretation of this material.> The manuscript had been revised by its author and in a number of places it was> quite impossible to decipher the pen interlineations, or replace words> destroyed by the tearing of the manuscript through frequent handling before it> came into my possession. At such places a word may be occasionally omitted or> a connection left defective,44 [index_split_019.html#filepos441894] otherwise> the following document is in the exact words of its author. This essay, I> believe, was written before her thirty-fifth year, that is ten years before> her suicide, and twenty-two years before the present publication.

(GENESIS 6:2)"},{"pageContent":"PREFACE It has been my high privilege to have some practical experience as the earthlywife of an angel from the unseen world. In the interests of psychical research Ihave tried to explore this pathway of communication with the spiritual universe,and, so far as lay in my power, to make a sort of rough guide-book of the route.For not all wives of heavenly bridegrooms travel the same path at first. Thereare roads running into this one from every religion and folklore under the sun,since the pathway of marital relations on the Borderland45[index_split_019.html#filepos442166] was once, and still is, as I hope to show,one of the main thoroughfares connecting our world with the world beyond thegrave. This thoroughfare, along part of which I hope to conduct the reader inimagination, is marked with signposts, many crumbling under the religious stormsof centuries, others preserved as sacred trellises upon which to train a rankgrowth of flourishing superstition, and still others fresh with modern paint andgilding. Part of this thoroughfare runs straight through the Christian Church,or, to speak more accurately, the foundations of the Church are laid upon thisvery principle. For Jesus himself is said to be the child of a union between anearthly woman and a heavenly bridegroom who (however godlike, and whatever thedetails of the relation) certainly seems to have manifested to Mary on theoccult plane. If it be objected that Mary's Borderland spouse was not an angel,but God himself, and therefore Borderland laws could be laid aside in His case,I reply that modern philosophy holds apparent miracles to be no violation ofnatural laws, but to have happened in accordance with some law as yet unknown tous, for God never breaks His laws, and if He became a Borderland spouse to Mary,it must have been in accordance with Borderland laws. And we, as made in Hislikeness, are bound by the same natural laws as God. Moreover, as Mary and meare sharers in a common humanity, she and me are bound alike, sharers in theglorious possibilities of Borderland. The abraded survivals of an ancient religious teaching of marital purity andself-control is of so lofty a type that it has been obscured by the fogs in thelowlands of modern sensuality. Enlightened by my experiences as the wife of myunseen angel visitant, I wrote a defense (from a folklore standpoint) of theDanse du Ventre, which was published in the New York World. This I afterwardsadded to, and issued in a typewritten essay for private circulation. As theessay showed that I wrote from experience, as I was still \"Miss\" Craddock, andas my social standing had hitherto been above suspicion, I deemed it onlyprudent to state to my readers that I had acquired my knowledge from a spirithusband. This I did on a little slip of paper pinned to the last page of theessay. The persecutions which—in consequence of this straightforward effort totell the truth simply and clearly—I suffered at the hands of those who deny thepossibility of angelic communication, need not be dwelt on here. Suffice it tosay that, while my non-occultist readers who did not know me personally,pooh-poohed the idea of a spirit husband, and declared that I must surely speakfrom an illicit experience, my non-occultist friends, who knew my habits of lifefrom day to day, could find no explanation for the essay but that I must havegone crazy; and two physicians made efforts to have me incarcerated as insane.One of the latter remarked, \"Had that essay been written by a man, by aphysician or by any other scientist (and the paragraph about the spirit husbandomitted) it would have been alright; but coming from an unmarried woman, neithera physician or a scientist, and with that claim of a spirit husband, there is noexplanation possible but (1) illicit experience, which is denied by all who knowher, or (2) insanity.\" That is to say, because I had, by means of knowledgegained through channels of which he was ignorant, given utterance to what wouldhave passed unquestioned if coming from a scientist, therefore, I must beinsane. To put it more tersely, a diamond of truth is to be considered genuineonly when discovered by A or B; if the same diamond be discovered by X, Y, or Z,it is to be considered paste. My worst offense, however, in his eyes, seemed tobe that, as a woman, I was out of my province in openly preaching maritalreform, however high the ideals advocated; and, as my sense of duty did notconform with his conventional prejudices, he felt justified in seeking toincarcerate me until I should recant my heresy.The factors in this case were: 1st. An unmarried woman of known reputation and integrity. 2nd. An essay writtenby that woman, dealing with the marital relation along lines not known to onemarried couple in a thousand. 3rd. A claim by the essayist, that she wrote froman experience gained as the wedded partner of a ghost. To ignore any one of these factors in arriving at a theory to explain the othertwo, is to invalidate that theory. Now, there is one creed to which all genuine Freethinkers46[index_split_019.html#filepos442540] are faithful. It is to seek the truth,wherever it leads, and whatever the traditional belief upon the subject underinvestigation. This being so, I feel that I may confidently appeal toFreethinkers to consider carefully the evidence herewith submitted as to maritalrelations on the Borderland.Last, but not least, I appeal to Spiritualists, Theosophists and Occultistsgenerally. Psychics and sex, Laurence Oliphant has shown, are so interwoven thatyou cannot take up one wholly separate from the other. Only an occultist—and [a]somewhat experienced occultist, at that—knows anything of the perils which awaitthe developing psychic on the Borderland. The Middle Ages are strewn withwrecked lives—mainly those of illiterate women, who, beginning by dabbling withmagic in an empirical fashion, ended by confessing themselves as witches,devil-haunted in body as well as in mind, and pledged to sins against nature.Within the sheltered precincts of the most conservative of all Christianchurches—the Roman Catholic—\"Congressus cum daemonis.\"47[index_split_019.html#filepos443038] And among the non-churchly practicers ofmodern occultism we too often find a tendency, on the one hand, not only tojustifiable freedom, but also to unjustifiable looseness of life; or on theother hand, to a rigid asceticism and unnatural suppression of the sex instinctas impure. All these things point to the necessity for some teaching as to thefundamental principles of sex morality on the Borderland—all the more, as spiritbridegrooms and spirit brides are much more frequent than is generally supposed.Between the witch who held diabolic assignations as a devil's mistress, and thepsychic who has been trained to self-control and reverent wedlock with an angel,it must surely be admitted, there is a wide stretch of road.48[index_split_019.html#filepos443323] Nevertheless, both are on the same road,and the downward grade is very slippery. In so far as I have been able toexplore this road, therefore I think it my duty to map out its perils and itssafeguards, as help to my fellow occultists. For, no matter on what obscureby-path a psychic starts, he or she can never be sure of not coming upon thisroad unexpectedly, since it is, as I have said, one of the main thoroughfares ofoccultism.To all three classes, then—to Occultists, Freethinkers and Christians—Irespectfully offer this treatise for consideration in the hope that each mayfind in it something of interest, and, mayhap, of profit."},{"pageContent":"HEAVENLY BRIDEGROOM The celestial being, who, whether as God or angel, becomes the HeavenlyBridegroom of an earthly woman, is better known to the literature of theChristian Church than most people who are not theologians are aware. But he isnot peculiar to Christianity. He has been known and recognized throughout theworld in all ages. The woman to whom he comes is, as a rule, distinguished forher purity of life. Usually she is a virgin; but where already married and amother, she must be recognized as chaste, or, at least, there must be no stigmaof impurity upon her reputation. I am not at the present writing aware of asingle exception to this. Let us, however, first consider the Heavenly Bridegrooms of Christianity, fromthe popular orthodox standpoint.There are two Heavenly Bridegrooms—the Holy Spirit and Christ. The first ofthese, the Holy Spirit, is, according to the New Testament, the Being throughwhose agency she whom the Catholic Church delights to honor as the BlessedVirgin became incarnate with Jesus. The second of these, Christ, is the Beinghonored alike by Catholics and by Protestants as the Bridegroom of the Church;by Catholics also as the mystic Spouse of the ecstatic and purified nun, as inthe case of Saint Teresa; and by Protestants as the Bridegroom of the Soul, inthat popular hymn beginning:> Jesus, Lover of my soul,> > > > Let me to Thy bosom fly!> > I once attended a young women's revival meeting at Ocean Grove, held under theauspices of an evangelist who was noted for his success in converting younggirls. When the enthusiasm flagged, and his hearers were slow in responding tohis appeals to \"come to Christ,\" he started the above hymn, and the ardor of hisfair congregation was at once kindled, girl after girl rising to publicly giveherself to Christ. That which earnest pleading for their soul's salvation hadfailed to accomplish, was brought about by this simple suggestion of the \"Loverof the Soul.\" In thus stimulating the untrained emotions of the maiden to aspireto the Divine through the symbolism of earthly affection, this revivalist notonly showed keen insight into human nature, but he was also instinctively trueto the teachings of the innermost truth of all religion, as I hope to showfurther on. In the Bible an entire book—the Song of Solomon—is given up to expressing theraptures of the Heavenly Bridegroom and his Bride. At least, this is theinterpretation which the Christian Church universally puts upon Canticles—thereciprocal Joys of Christ, the Bridegroom, and His Bride, the Church. Variousphases of the sensuous relations of husband and wife are there set forth, infigurative but unmistakable terms of passion—passion which the Christian worldhas, unfortunately, long since forgotten how to utilize as the most importantmeans of growth toward the Divine.But there are other Heavenly Bridegrooms besides Christ and the Holy Spiritreferred to in the Bible. In the sixth chapter of Genesis may be found a curioustext, which reads:> The sons of God saw the daughters of men, that they were fair; and they took> them wives of all that they chose. The Septuagint originally rendered the words \"Sons of God\" by ανγγελOιτOυ ΘεOυ(angels of God) and this rendering is found in Philo, de Gigantibus, Eusebius,Augustine and Ambrose. This view of Genesis 6:1-4 was held by most of the earlyfathers.49 [index_split_019.html#filepos443639] In fact, in the Book of Enoch, these sons of God are spoken of all through asangels who wedded earthly women; and it is further stated that these angelichusbands broke the law, living in depravity with their earthly wives, and layingthe foundation of evils which required the Deluge to sweep away. Criticalscholarship usually holds these angels to be fallen, but St. Augustine protestsagainst this very saying: \"I firmly believe that God's angels could never fallso at that time.\"Nevertheless we find in the Book of Enoch, 15:4, the following:> Whilst you were still spiritual, holy, in the enjoyment of eternal life, you> have defiled yourselves with women, have begotten (children) with the blood of> flesh, and have lusted after the blood of men, and produced flesh and blood,> as those produce them who are mortal and short-lived.50> [index_split_019.html#filepos443993] Here we see that the angels, whatever their [ . . . ] after depravity, were\"still holy\" when they united themselves as heavenly bridegrooms with earthlywomen. However, from the above, and from other texts in Enoch, it would appear that theangels are blamed for having broken the laws of right living so far as to turnthe relations existing between them and their earthly wives into the grossestsensuality. They, rather than the women, seem to be credited with theresponsibility for evil-doing. But it is noticeable that Genesis is silent as tothe character of these angelic bridegrooms, while it lays stress on the factthat the imaginations of men's hearts were evil continually, as though this lastwere the real cause of the wickedness which required the purification of theDeluge.Now, let us remember that the Book of Enoch, although referred to in Jude, isnot canonical. It belongs to the Hebrew Apocalyptic literature, and was for sometime lost, save for a few fragments preserved in references made byecclesiastical writers. However valuable to scholars, it is un-canonical andthus cannot be accepted by Christians as the Word of God. Genesis, on thecontrary, is accepted by Christians today as the Word of God; and therefore, thetotal omission of this sacred book to bring any charge against these angelic\"sons of God,\" while the depravity of man is dwelt upon at this period of theworld's history, is not a matter to be passed over lightly by a Christian.According to the Christian Scripture, then, it was not the wickedness of theangels who wedded earthly women, but the evil imaginations of the human heartthat brought about the punishment of the Deluge. And in this, Genesis is instrict accord with modern Theosophy—the only philosophy, so far as I know, whichprofesses to know the Alpha and Omega of occultism. Theosophy lays stress on thepunishment which awaits the black sorcerer—the earthly being who uses magicalpowers for selfish or impure purposes. But Theosophy is not alone in thisteaching. All occultism, by whatever name it is called, however imperfect indeductions, learns at least to beware of the occultist who breaks the moral law,or who, whether willfully or carelessly, through prejudice or through craftydesire to advance his own selfish interests, closes his eyes to the truth. Inother words, clear thinking and correct living are the only passport totrustworthiness in an occultist.I have said that all occultism learns this lesson at last. It is true that there are many psychical phenomena which at first sight do notseem to require any special exercise of morality on the part of the percipient.Such are the carefully attested phenomena of thought transference andwraith-seeing (especially of the astral form or \"double\" of people at the pointof death or undergoing a sudden shock) which the Society for PsychicalResearch51 [index_split_019.html#filepos444260] have collated from a multitudeof sources, in the case of the double to the number of some three thousand. Thepercipients in these instances are probably the average sort of folks, no betterand no worse than their fellows. Yet they see or they hear by means of senseswhich are still unrecognized by most people, and which are, therefore, termedoccult; and what they perceive is afterwards proved to be an actual occurrence,often of something taking place miles away. But it is to be observed that thereliable cases collated by the Psychical Research Society are furnished bypeople who seem to be clearheaded enough, at least, to form definite mentalconceptions. The majority of these cases are perceptions of occurrences in thisearthly life. Where the thing claimed as seen or heard by the percipients nolonger belongs to this world, but to the world beyond the grave, as in the caseof visions or voices of those now deceased, the phenomena, collated by theSociety of Psychical Research, seem not only to be capricious but they alsoseldom furnish a veridical (i.e., truth-telling) communication.In the case of Spiritualist mediums, professional or amateur, where thephenomena assume some show of regularity, and are claimed by the medium to comeentirely from the world beyond the grave, or through its aid, one always has tobe on one's guard against the subtle interpolation among otherwise truthfulmatter of fantastic or misleading statements made apparently by thecommunicating spirits themselves. Occultists in all ages have invariably assumedsuch statements to be the work of \"lying spirits.\" But it is noticeable that themedium of correct life and clearness of intellectual conception is less troubledby such lying spirits than is the medium of halting intellect or morals. This ofitself should indicate to the thoughtful student of occult phenomena that themedium, and not the spirits, may be to blame when lying communications are made.It is generally assumed that the false or fantastic remarks so subtlyinterpolated into communications which are otherwise truthful and uplifting aredue to evil spirits getting temporary control of the medium. But this theorypresupposes a state of society in the spirit-world far worse regulated than withus. It is often claimed, for instance, that throngs of spirits crowd about apowerful medium as a crowd of people on earth sometimes flock about a telegraphoperator in times of excitement, each man selfishly striving to get his messagesent off first. But, even in our imperfect civic life, is such an occurrenceusual? By no means. Is it likely that in a new life with its added experience,such gross violations of law and order should be allowed to continue rightalong? By no means. Even if Heaven be not as Christians believe, the abode ofGod and the angels; even supposing that it is merely, as most Spiritualistsclaim, an improved edition of this world; it is but logical to infer that lawand order will obtain there as here, and even more so, because Spiritual Union41 the tendency of human society is always in the direction of systematizing itswork for mutual convenience of its members. The idea of a good spirit may at anymoment be temporarily displaced by an evil one, and that the laws of thatclearer thought-world beyond the grave are powerless to cope with this annoyanceis absurd, and contrary to common sense. The fault of imperfect communication isjust as likely to be ours as others. Let us see to it that the lines oftelegraphic communication are laid in correctness of moral living, and clearnessof intellectual conception (on our side of the abyss of death), before we rashlyassume the fault to be theirs. In other words, if they are in a world where newlaws of matter obtain, as they must be, if they live at all after the death ofthe body—to communicate intelligently with us may not be so easy for them as weimagine. They may find themselves confronted at every turn by such difficulties.Therein will be found also a statement requiring an occult principle which seemsnot only to forbid spirits from communicating accurately with an immoral medium,but which seems to positively enjoin upon them the utterance of all the foolish,depraved and even criminal ideas that the medium is willing to receive, andplaces us mentally at a standpoint where all else is out of focus. Thus theslightest prejudices on any given subject under discussion between our celestialvisitors and ourselves will render us liable to distorted conceptions of theirideas. Such is the law of our own thought-world here on the earthly plane; andwe must remember that they have left our plane and entered into a far widerthoughtworld than ours. Hence the need for rigidly clear thinking on the part ofevery would-be occultist. And, since, as has been well said: \"All badness ismadness,\" we must not forget to also reckon a well-ordered moral life as amongthe attributes of the really clear-headed man or woman. This correct living andclear thinking go hand in hand as vouchers for accuracy of mediumship betweenthis world and the world beyond the grave. The philosophy which deals with thesubjective consciousness, as an important factor in fantastic and misleadingpsychic phenomena from spirits, will be found set forth at length. Sufficient tosay here that in all such cases, however varied the manifestations, whether ofan abnormal subconsciousness or of outside intelligences, failure to thinkclearly as to live in accordance with the moral requirements of self-control,duty, aspiration to the highest, unselfishness and genuine purity, will be foundresponsible for the disappointing psychic manifestations on the Borderland.52[index_split_019.html#filepos444688]When, therefore, the Book of Enoch blames the angelic sons of God, rather thantheir earthly wives, for the depravity of relations said to exist between themas spirits and mediums, we may well ask if this be not a matter on which thewriter of the Book of Enoch has carelessly accepted current legends. May it notbe that he, too, believed all depraved psychical manifestations to be due to\"evil spirits\" and that he was totally unaware of the occult law which bringsthese things to pass with a medium who, ignorantly but persistently, fails inclear thinking or correct living on the Borderland?Once more let us note that the Book of Genesis, which is canonical, lays stresson the fact that at this epoch the imaginations of men's hearts were evilcontinually.When the Christian Church appeared on the stage of history, it found severalvarying traditions current about those sons of God who, so many centuriesbefore, had taken unto themselves wives from among the daughters of men.One after the other, the early Church Fathers wrestled with these traditions,and strove to fit them into the Christian theological system. Beginning withPaul, we find that he asserts in the first chapter of I Corinthians, that awoman ought to be veiled, as a token of her inferiority and dependence upon man,and he adds: \"For this cause ought the woman to have a sign of authority on herhead because of the angels?\"53 [index_split_019.html#filepos444999] Irenaeus, inhis work Against Heresies, quoting this text, makes it read, \"A woman ought tohave a veil upon her head because of the angels.\"54[index_split_019.html#filepos445252] From Tertullian we learn what this means.He says in his work Against Marcion:> The apostle was quite aware that spiritual wickedness (Ephesians 6:12) had> been at work in heavenly places when angels were entrapped into sin by the> daughters of men.55 [index_split_019.html#filepos445599] In sundry places Tertullian waxes wroth over this supposed \"entrapping\" ofangels by earthly women. In a treatise On the Veiling of Virgins—written for thepurpose of compelling all unmarried women to be veiled as were the married, onereason being that they were \"Brides of Christ\"—he speaks his mind thus: > So perilous a face, then, ought to be shaded, which has cast stumbling- stones> even so far as heaven; that when standing in the presence of God, at whose bar> it stands accused of the driving of the angels from their (native) confines,> it may blush before the other angels as well; and may repress that former evil> liberty of its head—(a liberty) now to be exhibited not even before human> eyes.56 [index_split_019.html#filepos445966] The author of the Testaments of the Twelve Patriarchs is, if anything, moresevere. He remarks: > Hurtful are women, my children; because, since they have no power or strength> over the man, they act subtilly through outward guise how they may draw him to> themselves; and whom they cannot overcome by strength, him they overcome by> craft. . . . By means of their adornment, they deceive first their minds, and> instill the poison by the glance of their eye, and then they take them captive> by their doings, for a woman cannot overcome a man by force. . . . my children> . . . command your wives and your daughters that they adorn not their heads> and their faces; because every woman who acteth deceitfully in these things> hath been reserved to everlasting punishment. For thus they allured the> Watchers before the flood.57 [index_split_019.html#filepos446286] He adds that these angelic Watchers manifested as apparitions to the women atthe times of their union with their earthly husbands; \"and the women, having intheir minds desire towards their apparitions, gave birth to giants, for theWatchers appeared to them as reaching even unto heaven.\"58[index_split_019.html#filepos446606] Here we see an attempt to account for the resulting progeny of \"giants\" by suchsimple and natural means as Jacob made use of when he desired to produce\"ringstraked, speckled and spotted\" goats (Genesis 30:35). No mention is made ofmarital relations being established directly between earthly women and angels.Elsewhere the same writer speaks of these same Watchers as having \"changed theorder of their nature, whom also the Lord cursed at the flood, and for theirsakes made desolate the earth.\"59 [index_split_019.html#filepos446854]This follows a reference to Sodom, the writer seeming to trace a similaritybetween the two causes of the two punishments. Justin Martyr, however, makes theoffence of the sinning angels to consist rather in ambition for power overmankind. He says:> God . . . committed the care of men and of all things under heaven to angels> whom He appointed over them. But the angels transgressed this appointment, and> were captivated by love of women, and begat children who are those that are> called demons; and besides, they afterwards subdued the human race to> themselves, partly by magical writings, and partly by fears and the> punishments they occasioned, and partly by teaching them to offer sacrifices,> and incense, and libations, of which things they stood in need after they were> enslaved by lustful passions; and among men they sowed murders, wars,> adulteries, intemperate deeds, and all wickedness.60> [index_split_019.html#filepos447149] These things, according to Justin, the poets (unaware that they were due tosinning angels) ignorantly ascribed to God (Jupiter), and to those who werecalled his brothers, Neptune and Pluto, and to the Olympian deities in general. Lactantius lays the blame principally upon Satan. Speaking of the repeatedefforts of the serpent (\"who from his deeds received the name of devil, that is,accuser or informer\") to corrupt mankind, he adds:> But when God saw this, He sent His angels to instruct the race of men, and to> protect them from all evil. He gave these a command to abstain from earthly> things, lest, being polluted by any taint, they should be deprived of the> honor of angels. But that wily accuser, while they tarried among men, allured> these also to pleasures, so that they might defile themselves with women.> Then, being condemned by the sentence of God, and cast forth on account of> their sins, they lost both the name and substance of angels. Thus, having> become ministers of the devil, that they might have a solace of their ruin,> they betook themselves to the ruining of men, for whose protection they had> come.61 [index_split_019.html#filepos447475]> > Thus from angels the devil makes them to become his satellites and attendants.> But they who were born from these, because they were neither angels nor men,> but bearing a kind of mixed (middle) nature, were not admitted into hell, as> their fathers were not into heaven. Thus there came to be two kinds of demons;> one of heaven, the other of the earth.62 [index_split_019.html#filepos447882] In one place Justin Martyr speaks of \"evil demons\" who \"in times of old,assuming various forms, went in unto the daughters of men.\"63[index_split_019.html#filepos448204] Elsewhere he also speaks of these demonsmanifested as apparitions and misled boys as well as women. He said that they\"showed such fearful sights to men, that those who did not use their reason injudging of the actions that were done were struck with terror . . . and notknowing that these were demons, they called them gods.\"64[index_split_019.html#filepos448534] Justin evidently looks upon the angelicbridegroom as demoniacal from the start. Clement of Alexandria says that theangels \"renounced the beauty of God for a beauty which fades, and so fell fromheaven to earth.\"65 [index_split_019.html#filepos448799] Athenagoras asserts that the angels \"fell into impure love of virgins.\"66[index_split_019.html#filepos449147] But Tertullian calls attention to the factthat sacred Scripture terms these angels husbands; and he argues at length veryably to show that we are bound to infer from Scripture that the earthly wives ofthese angelic husbands were virgins, pure and undefiled, at the time of theirmarriage. From which it is evident that these marriages were acceptable tovirtuous women, and therefore, we may infer, not an infringement of the civillaw of the time, or the sex which is proverbially conservative would never havecontributed so largely to these unions from among its best members. Nor couldthey have been unions which transgressed the laws of nature, or the resultingoffspring would not have been so well developed physically (as giants) normentally (as \"mighty men which were of old, men of renown\").Clement of Alexandria, in his Miscellanies (Stromata), appears to blame thesinning angels in addition because they \"told to the women the secrets which hadcome to their knowledge; while the rest of the angels concealed them, or rather,kept them against the coming of the Lord.\"67[index_split_019.html#filepos449413] These \"secrets,\" we learn from several ofthe Christian Fathers, were the arts of metallurgy, dyeing, the properties ofherbs, astronomy and astrology, etc. Reasoning from this assumption that certainsciences and industrial arts were imparted to mankind from sinful angels, weneed not wonder that Tertullian pertinently asks:> But, if the self-same angels who disclosed both the material substance of this> kind and their charms—of gold, I mean, and lustrous stones—and taught men how> to work them, and by and by instructed them, among their other (instructions)> in (the virtue of) eye-lid powder and the dyeing of fleeces, have been> condemned by God, as Enoch tells us, how shall we please God while we joy in> the things of those (angels) who, on these accounts, have provoked the anger> and vengeance of God?68 [index_split_019.html#filepos449673] This thought seems to have been to him a matter of serious moment, for heenlarges upon it, as follows, when speaking of the dress and ornamentation ofwomen: > For they, withal, who instituted them are assigned, under condemnation, to the> penalty of death—those angels, to wit, who rushed from heaven on the daughters> of men; so that this ignominy also attaches to woman. For when to an age much> more ignorant than ours they had disclosed certain well-concealed material> substances, and several not well-revealed scientific arts—if it is true that> they had laid bare the operations of metallurgy, and had divulged the natural> properties of herbs, and had promulgated the powers of enchantments, and had> traced out every curious art, even to the interpretation of the stars—they> conferred properly and as it were peculiarly upon women that instrumental mean> of womanly ostentation, the radiances of jewels wherewith necklaces are> variegated, and the circlets of gold wherewith the arms are compressed, and> the medicaments of orchil with which wools are colored, and that black powder> itself wherewith the eyelids and eyelashes are made prominent. What is the> quality of these things may be declared meantime, even at this point, from the> quality and condition of their teachers; in that sinners could never have> either shown or supplied anything conducive to integrity, unlawful lovers> anything conducive to chastity, renegade spirits anything to the fear of God.> If these things are to be called teachings, ill masters must of necessity have> taught ill; if as wages of lust, there is nothing base of which the wages are> honorable. But why was it of so much importance to show these things as well> as to confer them? Was it that women, without material causes of splendor, and> without ingenious contrivances of grace, could not please men, who, while> still unadorned and uncouth, and—so to say—crude and rude, had moved the minds> of angels? Or was it that the {angelic} lovers would appear sordid and—through> gratuitous use—contumelious, if they had conferred no compensating gift on the> women who had been enticed into connubial connection with them?

Sure they were that all> ostentation, and ambition, and love of pleasing by carnal means, was> displeasing to God.69 [index_split_019.html#filepos449992] Cyprian, when blaming virgins for wearing jewels, necklaces and wool stuffscolored with costly dyes likewise remarks: > All which things sinning and apostate angels put forth by their arts, when,> lowered to the contagions of earth, they forsook their heavenly vigor.70> [index_split_019.html#filepos450335] When we remember that early Christianity sets its face like a flint against alldelights of the senses and that this extreme reaction of the spiritual againstthe sensuous has largely shaped our social customs of today, we begin to see howimportant and far-reaching were these opinions of the Church Fathers thatfeminine adornment had been taught by angels who had sinned in wedding earthlywomen, and that it was therefore a sinful thing in that it has emanated from adepraved source. Some of the theories built upon this assumption are quitecurious. Here are a few: > That which He Himself has not produced is not pleasing to God, unless He was> unable to order sheep to be born with purple and sky-blue fleeces! If He was> able, then plainly He was unwilling: what God willed not, of course ought not> to be fashioned.71 [index_split_019.html#filepos450651]> > For it was God, no doubt, who showed the way to dye wools with the juices of> herbs and the humours of conchs!

The theory [is] that awoman sins in adorning herself to please a husband (whether present orprospective), and this theory is still indescribably popular among devoutChristians. Commodianus ascribes the teaching of \"arts, and the dyeing of wool, andeverything which is done,\" not to the angels but to the giant progeny. And headds:> To them, when they died, men erected images. But the Almighty, because they> were of an evil seed, did not approve that, when dead, they should be brought> back from death. Whence wandering they now subvert many bodies, and it is such> as these especially that ye this day worship and pray to as gods.76> [index_split_019.html#filepos452359] The author of the Clementine Homilies records a tradition concerning thesegigantic \"wanderers\" on the borders of Ghostland77[index_split_019.html#filepos452762] which seems to him that they were notunable to beget children. After speaking of the Deluge he says: > Since, therefore, the souls of the deceased giants were greater than human> souls, inasmuch as they also excelled their bodies, they, as being a new race,> were called also by a new name. And to those who survived in the world a law> was prescribed of God through an angel, how they should live. For being> bastards in race, of the fire of angels and the blood of woman, and therefore> liable to desire a certain race of their own, they were anticipated by a> certain righteous law.78 [index_split_019.html#filepos453012] Inasmuch as the Deluge had already destroyed everyone on the earth except Noahand his family, we see that the author cannot mean by those who survived in theworld any giants still in the flesh. Moreover, the decree which followed andwhich prescribed that they are to have power over only those human beings whobreak the moral law and practice magic would indicate these \"giants\" had thenentered upon what Theosophists would call astral, and from the paragraph quotedabove, it is evidently taken for granted that these astral giants wouldpropagate their kind. This is an important point—the testimony of a ChristianFather of a tradition that human beings (not created angels) who had onceinhabited bodies, could beget children on the plane of the astral unlessprevented by the direct prohibition of Heaven. If it be objected that the authorrefers to giants still in earthly form when he speaks to \"those who survived inthe world,\" I am sure that the statement follows a remark about the Deluge andthat in that case the surviving giants must have been Noah and his family. Thisview, however, is absurd, when we consider that the decree forbade the giants toassume power over any but the human race. If Noah and his family were thesurviving giants, where would be the sense in promulgating such a decree tothem? This same author gives an account of the doings of the angelic fathers ofthese giants which reminds one strongly of the spirit séances of the late Rev.Stainton Moses,79 [index_split_019.html#filepos453424] when under conditionswhich precluded all fraud or illusion, tiny pearls and other precious stonessuddenly materialized before the sitters. Here is the tradition recorded by theChristian Fathers: > For of the spirits who inhabit the heaven, the angels who dwell in the lowest> region, being grieved at the ingratitude of men to God, asked that they might> come into the life of men, that, really becoming men, by more intercourse they> might convict those who had acted ungratefully towards Him, and might subject> every one to adequate punishment. When, therefore, their petition was granted,> they metamorphosed themselves into every nature; for, being of a more godlike> substance, they are able easily to assume any form. So they became precious> stones, and goodly pearl, and the most beauteous purple, and choice gold, and> all matter that is held in most esteem. And they fell into the hands of some,> and into the bosoms of others, and suffered themselves to be stolen by them.> They also changed themselves into beasts and reptiles, and fishes and birds,> and into whatsoever they pleased. These things also the poets among> yourselves, by reason of fearlessness, sing, as they befell, attributing to> one the many and diverse doings of all.80 [index_split_019.html#filepos453805] (Then, \"having assumed these forms, they convicted as covetous those who stolethem, and changed themselves into the nature of men, in order that, livingholily, and showing the possibility of so living, they might subject theungrateful to punishment.\"81 [index_split_019.html#filepos454121] However,\"having become in all respects men, they also became subject to masculineinfirmities and fell.\"82 [index_split_019.html#filepos454386]) Does it not seem as though we had here a survival of Animism—a state of mindfrequent among savages, children and animals in which an inanimate object whichmoves without visible cause or manifests in any peculiar way is thought to bealive. A horse is often terrified by a piece of paper blown in front of him,evidently he takes it for a live creature. Savages speak of the sun and moon asliving individuals because of their apparently voluntary journeys through thesky; among the Kukis of Southern Asia, if a man was killed by a fall from atree, his relatives would take their revenge by cutting the tree down,scattering it in chips. A modern King of Cochin, China, when one of his shipssailed badly, used to put it in the pillory as he would any other criminal.83[index_split_019.html#filepos454826] In classical times, the stories of Xerxesflogging the Hellespont and Cyrus draining the Gyndes occur as cases in point,but one of the regular Athenian legal proceedings is a yet more striking relic.A court of justice was held at the Prytaneum, to try any inanimate object, suchas an axle, a piece of wood or stone, which had caused the death of anyonewithout proved human agency, and this wood or stone, if condemned, was withsolemn form cast beyond the border. The spirit of this remarkable procedurereappears in the old English law (repealed in the present reign), whereby, notonly a beast that kills a man, but a cart-wheel that runs over him, as a treethat falls on him, kills him, is dead and is given to God, forfeited and soldfor the poor. The pathetic custom of \"telling the bees\" when the master ormistress of a house dies, is not unknown in our own country. In Berlin, Germany,the idea is more fully worked out; and not only is the sad message given toevery bee-hive in the garden and every beast in the stall, but every sack ofcorn must be touched and everything in the house shaken, that they may know themaster is gone. And we all know that even an intelligent nineteenth century manis not above administering an angry kick to a chair against which he has bruisedhimself.Now the author of the Clementine Homilies seems to have similarly lighted on aninstance of Animism in connection with gold, pearls, precious stones, etc. Inprehistoric times this tradition, rational and intelligible, may suppose thatthese precious articles had moved or otherwise behaved as though endowed withlife in the ancient times to which the tradition relates. Could it be that theysuddenly appeared to those prehistoric gazers, coming from no one knew where,and moved about by unseen hands, as tables are lifted, bells rung, banjos playedor flowers materialized at a modern spiritual séance, evidently reported to havecome by occult means, supposed to be heavenly. The people who witnessed thephenomena were probably not accustomed to clear-headed and intelligentinvestigation of such phenomena, see at once it was an Animistic explanationsuch as is given in the Clementine Homilies. As to the frightened horse, and tothe ignorant savage, inanimate things seem to be alive, so may the preciousobjects which materialized at those prehistoric séances have seemed to thebeholders to be living creatures, inasmuch as they sped through the air withoutvisible support. If alive, they surely (so would argue the witnesses) must beangelic beings since they were said to come from heaven and the attendantphenomena of the séance no doubt would increase the awe with which these\"angels\" were received and treasured. An \"angel\" is simply a vehicle for amessage in the original signification. Let us glance in passing at the accountsof materializing through the psychic power. In this sense a pearl materializedthrough the psychic power of so reliable a modern medium as the Rev. StaintonMoses, plainly by occult means, might be called an \"angel\"—i.e., the means bywhich the message from the unseen reached the sitters. In after times when theword angel had come to be specialized as a personal envoy from Heaven, the oldtradition about the pearls and precious stones which had evidently come as\"angels\" (vehicles for a heaven-sent message) whenever told would probably beadapted to the specialized meaning and it would be said as above, that personalbeings transformed into these inanimate things. First, as to the manifestationsthrough the Rev. Stainton Moses lately declared, in his journal occurs thefollowing entry:> Tuesday, September 9th, 1873. Same conditions. Plentiful scent as before.> Sixteen little pearls were put on the table, six having been previously given> during the day. Mrs. Speer and I were writing at the same table, and a pearl> was put on my letter as I was writing. After that I saw a spirit standing by> Mrs. Speer, and was told that it was Mentor, who had put a pearl on Mrs.> Speer's desk. After that four others came. They seemed to drop on the table,> just as I have seen them with Mrs. A—h. We have in all twenty-one now. They> are small seed pearls, each perforated. A week later, there is this entry: > When we broke up we found a little heap of pearls was put before each. One> hundred and thirty-nine little pearls have been brought to us, one hundred and> ten in the last two days. (This, it appears from another witness, occurred in daylight.) Dr. Speer84 [index_split_019.html#filepos455141] (referred to by Miss X. inBorderland85 [index_split_019.html#filepos455445] as \"a highly intelligent andby no means credulous witness\") gives a striking instance of the materializationof a precious object:> December 31st, 1872. A very successful séance. A blue enamel cross was> brought, no one knew whence, placed before my wife, who was told to wear it. Mrs. Speer testifies as follows: > Ventnor, November 29th, 1893. I wish to state that the most convincing> evidences of spirit-power always took place when hands were held.> > Other manifestations occurred, often in light, such as raps, raising of table,> scent, musical sounds, and showers of pearls. . . . Two cameos were carved in> light while we were dining. Before leaving this part of the subject, it may be well to quote the followingby Miss X. in Borderland (Miss X., I would add, is by no means a Spiritualist,but is distinctly opposed to the Spiritistic hypothesis): > Mr. Stainton Moses has for many years been one of the most important witnesses> for Spiritualism. The fact that, like Professor Crookes86> [index_split_019.html#filepos455754] and Alfred Russel Wallace,87> [index_split_019.html#filepos456187] he was a gentleman, a scholar, and a man> of recognized position and character, was, to say the least, a good letter of> introduction. . . . It may be said, once and for all, that it is unnecessary> to insist on the absolute sincerity of Mr. Stainton Moses. It is a point which> has never been so much as raised. His life has been of a kind not to be called> in question—obscure without mystery, dignified without pedantry, lived in the> sight of just that class of the public which demands the strictest> respectability of conduct, the most unequivocal correspondence between life> and profession. As a clergyman he was beloved by his parishioners, as a> schoolmaster he was respected by his boys, as a personal friend he commanded> the confidence and esteem of all his intimates.88> [index_split_019.html#filepos456549] May it not be that the phenomena recorded by the author of the ClementineHomilies are essentially the same in kind as those referred to above in the caseof the Rev. Stainton Moses? St. Augustine, considering the possibility of occult sex relations betweenearthly women and beings from the unseen world, remarks:> The Scriptures plainly aver that the angels have appeared both in visible and> palpable figures. And seeing it is so general a report, and so many aver it> either from their own experience or from others, that are of indubitable> honesty and credit, that the sylvans and fauns, commonly called incubi, have> often injured women, desiring and acting carnally with them, and that certain> devils from whom the Gauls call dusii, do continually practice this . . . and> tempt others to it, which is affirmed by such persons, and with such> confidence that it were impudence to deny it, I dare not venture to determine> anything here as to whether the devils being embodied in air (for this air> being violently moved is felt) can suffer this lust, or move it so as the> women, with whom they commix, may feel it; yet do I firmly believe that God's> angels could never fall so at that time.89> [index_split_019.html#filepos456815] Notice the perplexity of St. Augustine as a logician. He cannot deny that occultsex relations exist on the Borderland, the testimony to this is too widespreadand of too reliable a character. But (we can imagine him saying), how reconcilethese phenomena with the belief that the inhabitants of the world beyond thegrave are immaterial, vapory, mist-like beings? How can such a hazy, ethereal creature as a ghost produce objective sensationsof touch upon an earthly being? And if possible—as he ingeniously supposes, bysuch means as air becomes perceptible to us when violently put in motion—howreconcile such phenomena with the belief that sex is impure, and that it doesnot exist in the world beyond the grave? How could God's angels ever fall so? Itwere impossible.But St. Augustine evidently starts from two hypotheses —the unsubstantiabilityof ghosts and the impurity (as will be seen by a perusal of the quotation infull) and, therefore, non-existence of sex, neither of which two hypotheses hasever been definitely proven. As a logician therefore, he is at fault, and I havealready shown the danger of starting from mistaken premises when dealing withoccult phenomena. The two hypotheses, however, were not peculiar to St.Augustine. They were, and are, the common property of the majority of mankind.But it does not follow that they are correct: and the psychic who rashly assumestheir truth to start with (through prejudice or because other people think so)may expect to be deluded, and to come upon all sorts of fantastic, and possiblydiabolical manifestations. Such is the occult law. Start with a false premise orwith a premise which you have not investigated with scrupulous care, and you arecertain to get phenomena of either a misleading or a depraved character.But all the Christian Fathers did not accept the possibility of bridegrooms fromthe unseen world. There were then, as now, Materialist minds which disbelievedin ghosts. Alexander, Bishop of Lycopolis, endeavored to explain away angelicbridegrooms as myths, thus:> When the Jewish history relates that angels came down to hold intercourse with> the daughters of men . . . this saying signifies that the nutritive powers of> the soul descended from heaven to earth.90> [index_split_019.html#filepos457133] Hence the \"injuring\" of women by incubi to which St. Augustine refers, aninjuring either wholly subjective and illusory, or, if objectively real, wasbrought about in part by the woman's ignorance of the occult requirements forcorrect living and clear-headedness on the Borderland, in part by her failure tothus live and think on the earthly plane. It would be interesting to know his authority for this. Rationalistic theoriescannot rest, as do folklore traditions, upon a mere say-so; they must besupported either by testimony or by argument. Otherwise, we are obliged todismiss them as the whimsical fancies of a solitary individual.Origen says he will \"persuade those who are capable of understanding the meaningof the prophet, that even before us there was one who referred this narrative tothe doctrine regarding souls, which became possessed with a desire for thecorporeal life of91 [index_split_019.html#filepos457551] men,\" and thus inmetaphorical language he termed them \"daughters of men.\" But Origen does notgive his authority, nor advance any argument in support of this explanation.Julius Africanus suggests another Rationalistic explanation, but is candidenough to give it as his own notion. He says:> When men multiplied on the earth, the angels of heaven came together with the> daughters of men. In some copies I found \"the sons of God.\" What is meant by> the Spirit, in my opinion, is that the descendants of Seth are called the sons> of God on account of the righteous men and patriarchs who have sprung from> him, even down to the Saviour Himself; but that the descendants of Cain are> named the seed of men, as having nothing divine in them, on account of the> wickedness of their race and the inequality of their nature, being a mixed> people, and having stirred the indignation of God.92> [index_split_019.html#filepos457881] This ingenious theory has been eagerly grasped at by succeeding Christianwriters who disbelieve in the substantiality of ghosts. So able a commentator inmodern times, however, as Delitzsch93 [index_split_019.html#filepos458193] OnGenesis decides against this view, and quotes various authorities which I giveelsewhere. He also quotes Keil as demonstrating that two of the Hebrew words inthe text in Genesis show that \"the contraction of actual and lasting marriages\"is meant. Julius Africanus, indeed, seems to have had doubts as to whether the currenttradition about angelic bridegrooms might not be true after all, for he addsdirectly upon the heels of the above theory:> But if it is thought that these refer to angels, we must take them to be those> who deal with magic and jugglery, who taught the women the motions of the> stars and the knowledge of things celestial, by whose power they conceived the> giants as their children, by whom wickedness came to its height on the earth,> until God decreed that the whole race of the living should perish in their> impiety by the Deluge.94 [index_split_019.html#filepos458571] Nevertheless, Rationalists and Materialists are in the minority among theFathers of the Church as regards this subject. The majority accepted theaccounts in Genesis and Enoch at their face value. To briefly sum up the majority's views of the early church on this matter: 1. Angels of a superior order did come into the earthly life—whether (a) because God sent them, or (b) because they were moved with indignation at the ingratitude of men toward God and came voluntarily in order to reconcile God and man, or (c) because they were enticed by women on the earth, the traditions do not agree. 2. Having come into this earthly life, they became either the lovers or the husbands of women, whether beguiled thereto in part by the Devil, or wholly by the women, or partially or wholly by their own desires, the traditions again do not agree. One tradition, as we have seen, hints at the sin of Sodom; and an interference on the astral plane with the rights of earthly husbands; others hint at illicit amours; but Tertullian demonstrates unanswerably from sacred Scripture that the angels were the wedded husbands of the daughters of men, and that these daughters were virginal at the time of wedding their angelic lovers. This was not, however, all their sin. One tradition, as we have seen, makes a vague allusion to the sin of Sodom in connection with the intercourse of angels with women. 3. That an angelic woman should seek an honorable marriage, especially an earthly woman, it would appear, was reckoned a sin. When asked why, we find that the Church Fathers, one and all, treated marriage as a mere expedient. Tertullian said that the reason why \"marrying\" is good, is that \"burning\" is worse. Minncius Felix remarks that \"with some even the modest intercourse of the sexes causes a blush.\"95 [index_split_019.html#filepos458836] Methodius has an entire book devoted to an argument offered by ten virgins against wedlock and on behalf of perpetual virginity. Origen says: \"God has allowed us to marry, because all are not fit for the higher, that is, the perfectly pure life.\"96 [index_split_019.html#filepos459134] Cyprian says that, \"Chastity maintains the first rank in virgins, the second in those who are continent, the third in the case of wedlock.\"97 [index_split_019.html#filepos459387] He also says: > What else is virginity than the glorious preparation for the future life? > Virginity is of neither sex. Virginity is the continuance of infancy. > Virginity is the triumph over pleasures. Virginity has no children; but > what is more, it has contempt for offspring; it has not fruitfulness, but > neither has it bereavement; blessed that it is free from the pain of > bringing forth, more blessed still that it is free from the calamity of > the death of children. What else is virginity than the freedom of liberty? > It has no husband for a master. Virginity is freed from all affections; it > is not given up to marriage, nor to the world, nor to children.98 > [index_split_019.html#filepos459661] Justin Martyr exults that \"many, both men and women, of the age of sixty and seventy years, who have been disciples of Christ from their youth, continue in immaculate virginity.\"99 [index_split_019.html#filepos459989] In a spurious fragment credited to \"Hippolytus, the Syrian Expositor of the Forum,\" the writer refers to an ancient Hebrew MS., which tells of Noah being commanded by God to stake off each male animal in the ark from the corresponding female. The other and principal object of marriage which runs through all nature from protoplasmic cells up to man—of mutual exchange of strength and mutual happiness, seems to have been totally ignored by the early Christian Fathers. Lactantius held that it is impossible the two sexes could have been instructed except for the sake of generation. Justin Martyr says frankly: > Either marry at first, for no other object than to rear children, or else > abstaining from marriage, continue to live in a state of continence.100 > [index_split_019.html#filepos460261] He notes with approval a Christian youth who begged Felix, the governor of Alexandria, for permission to be made a eunuch by a physician, in order to attest his continence to the world. (Felix, however, had the good sense to refuse.) To such an extent was this unnatural loathing for wedlock carried, that Constantine found it judicious to remove the old-time penalties against celibacy, because of the many Christians who continued celibates from motives of religion. Since marriage on natural grounds was thus depreciated by the early Church as impure when occurring between earthly men and women, we need not wonder that she viewed with horror the very thought of wedlock with an angel inasmuch as angels were supposed to be above earthly weaknesses. Having thus started from a false premise, i.e., that marital passion cannot be pure in God's sight, there was no other deduction to be made regarding these love-matches between angels and women but that they were sinful. 4. But, according to the Christian Fathers, the angels committed other sins, in addition to seeking a woman in honorable marriage. They actually endeavored to beautify the world into which they had come, and to make men wiser and happier by teaching them various arts and sciences. One might have thought this a cause for gratitude; but the Church Fathers, having started from a false premise, were logically bound to deduce the theory which Tertullian did—that as these spirit husbands were fallen angels, what they taught could not possibly be conducive either to integrity, chastity, or the fear of God. Therefore, dress and adornment and the industrial arts of dyeing and metallurgy were sinful, and consequently, displeasing to the Almighty. Very different is the view taken by a more modern writer, Sir Thomas Browne, the author of the Religio Medici who, advocating the doctrine of this celestial guardianship over marriage on earth, observes: \"I do think that many mysteries ascribed to our own inventions, have been the courteous revelation of spirits; for those noble essences in heaven bear a friendly regard unto their fellow natures on earth.\"101 [index_split_019.html#filepos460569] 5. Ambition plays a prominent part in the traditions, it will be noticed. It is said that these angels were ambitious for earthly power and exacted libations and sacrifices; and also that they were the beings whom the heathen ignorantly supposed to be gods.But if the reader will recall what I have said about the misleadings in spiritmanifestations when the psychic starts from a false premise, he will understandhow possible it is that we have to deal here with subjective illusions, and notobjective realities; and that the lower estimate in which these angelic visitorscame to be held was due entirely to the failure of psychics to keep the laws ofcorrect moral living or common sense and his weaknesses and vanities andsuperstitions will be played upon ad libitum. As for the giant offspring said tohave resulted from these unions—offspring which in the male line becameevil-doers, and finally demons on the astral plane—if the reader will considerthat necessity to which I have referred for correct living and clear thinking onboth sides of the abyss of death, if the bridge of communication is to hold, hewill see that if these \"giants\" continued to influence the world from the astralplane they could not be evil demons, but must be beneficent helpers of mankind.But there is, I think, grave doubt as to whether such offspring ever resultedfrom these unions between angels and earthly women, as the reader will see whenI come to speak of the occult laws governing such unions. Nevertheless, there issomething to be said on both sides, and we should do well to reserve ourjudgment until all the evidence is before us. We have seen that Commodianus says that these giants are the gods to whom theheathen ignorantly prayed. Justin Martyr, mindful of certain similaritiesbetween the stories told of those same heathen gods and the Scriptural accountof Jesus, advances the theory that the demons had some imperfect perception ofthe coming Messiah, gleaned from the Old Testament prophecies, and that theytried to forestall Christianity by ascribing Christ's possible attributes inadvance to the gods.> The demons, then, hearing these prophetic words {Genesis 49:10– 11,} asserted> that Bacchus was born the son of Jupiter; they ascribed to him also the> invention of the vine, and in the celebration of his mysteries led an ass in> procession, and taught that Bacchus was torn in pieces and taken up into> heaven.102 [index_split_019.html#filepos460910] Justin also draws a comparison between some of these gods and Christ, to showthat Christianity claims no more for its god than aid the heathen for those whomthey called \"Sons of Jove.\" He says: > When we affirm that the Word, which is the first-begotten of God, was born> without carnal knowledge, even Jesus Christ our Master, and that he was> crucified, and died, and rose again and ascended into heaven, we advance no> new thing different from what is maintained respecting those whom ye call the> sons of Jupiter. For ye well know how many sons your approved writers> attribute to Jupiter: Mercury, the word of interpretation and the teacher of> all men; Esculapius, who was a physician, and yet struck with lightning and> taken up into heaven; Bacchus, who was torn in pieces; Hercules, who burned> himself upon the pile to escape his torments; Castor and Pollux, the sons of> Leda; Perseus the son of Danae; and Bellerophon, born of human race, and> carried away upon the horse Pegasus. . . . Neither is it necessary that I> should relate to you, who already know well, of what kind were the actions of> each of those who were called the sons of Jupiter; I need only say, that the> writings in which they are recorded, tend only to corrupt and pervert the> minds of those who learn them; for all take a pride in being the imitators of> the gods. . . . But if we say that he {Jesus} was begotten of God, in a manner> far different from ordinary generation, being the Word of God, as we have> before said, let this be considered a correspondence with your own tenets,> when ye call Mercury the word who bears messages from God. And if any one> objects to us that He was crucified; this too is a point of correspondence> with those whom ye call the sons of Jupiter, and yet allow to have suffered. .> . . Again, if we affirm that he was born of a virgin; let this be considered a> point in which he agrees with what you (fabulously) ascribe to Perseus. And> whereas we say that he made those whole, who were lame, palsied, and blind> from their birth, and raised the dead; in this too we ascribe to him actions> similar to those which are said to have been performed by Esculapius.103> [index_split_019.html#filepos461234] We thus see that the heathen gods and heroes whose father was Jupiter, theChristian Messiah whose father was the holy spirit and the traditional \"giants\"whose fathers were angels, were, in the eyes of at least one Church Father, butdifferent aspects of the same underlying principle—the possibility of maritalunion between dwellers in the unseen world and dwellers upon the earth, for thepurpose of begetting children. Today, however, we look upon the story of virginborn Perseus as fabulous.104 [index_split_019.html#filepos461577] But theancient heathen opponents of Justin seem to have accorded a scant respect to thestory of the virgin-born Jesus as we do to the story of virgin-born Perseus. Nowto laugh to scorn the birth of Perseus from the occult union of God with onevirgin, and then to accept without question the birth of Jesus from the occultunion of God with another virgin, is somewhat inconsistent. On strictly logicalgrounds, if one story be false, so may the other be false; if one be true, somay the other be true. But Perseus is only one of many virgin-born heroes orgods. We find these children of a visible earthly mother and an invisible,celestial mysterious father, the world over, in all ages. There was Buddha, the child of MImage [images/00008.jpg]yImage[images/00008.jpg] and a celestial being god who, in the form of a whiteelephant, entered her side, or according to De Gingnes,105[index_split_019.html#filepos462030] his mother conceived by a ray of lightwithout defilement.The Hindu Krishna was born of a chaste matron, who, though a wife and a mother,is always spoken of as the Virgin Devaki. Krishna, by the way, has manyattributes in common with Kama, the East Indian god of love, corresponding tothe Latin Cupid. He is represented as black—a symbolism to which I will returnlater on.The Egyptian God Ra was born from the side of his mother, \"but was notengendered.\"The Mayas of Yucatan had a virgin-born god, named Zama.Among the Algonquin Indians we find the tradition of a great teacher, by nameMichabou, who was born of a celestial Manitou and an earthly mother.> Upon the altars of the Chinese temples were placed behind a screen, an image> of Shin-moo, or the \"Holy Mother,\" sitting with a child in her arms, in an> alcove, with rays of glory around her head, and tapers constantly burning> before her.106 [index_split_019.html#filepos462571] In ancient Mexico, > The Virgin Chimalman, also called Sochiquetzal or Suchiquecal, was the mother> of Quecalcoatle.107 [index_split_019.html#filepos462982] In one representation> he is shown hanging by the neck holding a cross in his hands.

Note, also, theresemblance between this tradition and the Christian tradition, concerning theangel's offering Mary a lily-branch at the Annunciation. Evidently, these aretwo different aspects of the same symbolism. Higgins, continuing, says: \"All this history the Monkish writer is perfectlycertain is the invention of the Devil,\"111 [index_split_019.html#filepos464244]and Justin Martyr strove to account for the analogy between the story of Christand the story of Bacchus by supposing that demons had imitated the ChristianScriptures in advance, so totally unaware was he that both stories had the sameesoteric meaning to the initiate. \"Torquemada's Indian history was mutilated atMadrid before it was published. Suchiquecal is called the Queen of Heaven. Sheconceived a son, without connection with man, who is the God of Air. . . . TheMohammedans have a tradition that Christ was conceived by the smelling of arose.\"112 [index_split_019.html#filepos464504]In the Finnish epic of the Kalevala there is a heroine by the name of Mariatta(from Marja, \"berry\") who becomes pregnant through unwittingly eating aberry—the berry here playing a similar part to the rose referred to above in theMohammedan tradition. She goes from one to another person, vainly seeking aplace in which to bring forth her child. At last she is referred by onehousehold to the stable of \"the flaming horse of Hisi\"; and she then appeals tothe horse of Hisi in the following words:> Breathe, O sympathizing fire-horse,> > > > Breathe on me, the virgin-mother!> > > > Let thy heated breath give moisture,> > > > Let thy pleasant warmth surround me,> > > > Like the vapor of the morning;> > > > Let this pure and helpless maiden> > > > Find a refuge in thy manger!> > Observe that, although the mother of an illegitimate child, she, like all themothers of such children when their father is divine or mysterious, is \"pure,\"the \"virgin-mother,\" etc. These virgin-mothers are not copies of the Christian Mary. Most, if not all ofthem, were known long before the days of Christianity.The mother of the Siamese \"Somona Cadom\" was impregnated by sunbeams, anotherform of Danae's golden shower. She was called Maha Maria or Maya Maria, i.e.,\"the Great Mary.\" And this brings out some curious coincidences in name amongvirgin-mothers. Thus:Marietta of the Kalevala has already been referred to above.The mother of Hermes or Mercury was Myrrha or Maia.Maya, the mother of Buddha, is identical in name with the Hindu goddess Maya,who is represented as walking upon the waters, with her peplum teeming withanimals, to show her fecundity. Maya is also a well-known Hindu term for\"illusion.\"The month of May (so nearly like the name of Maia) was sacred to some of thevirgin-goddesses of ancient times, as it is now to Mary, the Mother of Jesus.The Christian Virgin Mary was also called Myrrha; and she is still called SantaMaria in Southern Europe and in Mexico. The title bestowed on her of \"Star ofthe Sea\"—a title given to the Egyptian Virgin-mother, Isis, perhaps two thousandyears earlier—shows how close a resemblance tradition and folklore have tracedbetween both of these virgin-mothers and the ancient genitrix of the waters.Also, the Latin mare and the French mer for \"the sea,\" and the French mère for\"mother\" bear a striking resemblance to the name Mary in sound. And Venus was,born from the foam of sea, presiding divinity of love between the sexes. She iscredited with having been \"indulgent Venus\"113[index_split_019.html#filepos464775] to a mortal man, Anchises, to whom she borethe hero of Virgil's Aeneid —a Borderland espousal, this; though here it is thewife and not the husband who comes from the invisible world.The Apocryphal Gospels speak of the Virgin Mary's being brought up as an orphan,in the temple, and they refer to her as an obedient and pure-minded maiden,accustomed to holding daily converse with angels. That she should have beencalled by the same root-name as these ancient virgin-mothers, is, therefore, theless remarkable, if we consider the possibility of her having been trained inthe temple by the priests as an initiate in the sacred mysteries, and of herhaving passed the various ordeals so successfully as to entitle her to be calledby the name sacred to the type of womanhood accounted worthy to sustain maritalrelations on the Borderland.In some cases it would appear that ambitious princes or other designingpoliticians of ancient days did not scruple to avail themselves of the currentbelief in the possibility of divine paternity, when it would serve theirpurpose. It was an open secret among the Greeks that Alexander the Great had nothesitated to do this, on the occasion of his march into Egypt and Syria, whenthe oracle at the temple of Jupiter Ammon (doubtless for a bribe) declaredAlexander to be the son of Jupiter, saying that this god, in the form of aserpent, had manifested to Alexander's mother.The serpent is, in ancient sex worship, a well-known symbol of the phallus, andtherefore, of the creative fatherhood. It appears in several stories of divinelybegotten children.Scipio Africanus was another politician who availed himself of the popularbelief in these matters, it would seem. \"There is no doubt,\" remarks Higgins inhis Anacalypsis, \"that he aimed at the sovereignty of Rome, but the people weretoo sharp-sighted for him.\"114 [index_split_019.html#filepos465024] A. Gellinesays, \"The wife of Publius Scipio was barren for so many years as to create adespair of issue, until one night, when her husband was absent, she discovered alarge serpent in his place, and was informed by soothsayers that she would beara child. In a few days she perceived signs of conception, and after ten monthsgave birth to the conqueror of Carthage.\"115[index_split_019.html#filepos465297]The Emperor Augustus was said to have been the result of a mysterious connectionof his mother with a serpent in the temple of Apollo.Ovid in his Fasti records a story that Servius Tullius was a mysterious shape,claiming to be a vulcan, which appeared to the mother, Ocrisia, among the ashesof the altar, when she was assisting her mistress (Ocrisia was a captive) in thesacred rite of pouring a libation of wine upon the altar.Pythagoras, who lived more than five hundred years before Christ, was said to bethe offspring of Apollo. He was born on a journey, his father (or rather, hismother's earthly husband) having traveled up to Sidon on business. Pythais, themother, had been beloved by a ghostly personage who claimed to be the godApollo. Afterwards this same apparition showed itself to the husband, informinghim of the parentage of the coming child, and bidding him to have no connectionwith his wife until after its birth.A similar event is said to have transpired in the case of Plato, Apollo hisfather also. His mother was Perictione, a virgin, who was betrothed to oneAriston at the time. In this case, also, Apollo appeared to inform the earthlylover of the child's paternity. Higgins, relating this tradition, adds:> On this ground, the really very learned Origen defends the immaculate> conception116 [index_split_019.html#filepos465620] assigning, also, in> confirmation of the fact, the example of Vultures (Vautours) who propagate> without the male.117 [index_split_019.html#filepos465988] The Vulture was an accompaniment of Hathas [Hathor], the Egyptian Venus; and itwould therefore seem as though Origen had unwittingly stumbled on a bit offolklore. Graves, in his Sixteen Crucified Saviors, remarks (I know not on whatauthority, but give his remark rather for its suggestiveness than as avouched-for historical fact): > Many are the cases noted in history of young maidens claiming a paternity for> their male offspring by a God.

It is a curious co-incidence that the name Rhea, which was one ofthe names of the Mother of all the gods, is applied by one writer to the VirginMary who likewise became the \"Mother of God.\" The Mongolian conqueror, Genghis Khan, and his two twin brothers were said to bethe result of an occult union of the earthly mother with a mysteriousintelligence.> His mother having been left a widow, lived a retired life; but some time after> the death of her husband . . . she was suspected to be pregnant.

Ihave already said that, despite the immense number of traditions and miraculousbirths, I doubt if such ever occur upon the borderland of the two worlds, owingto certain occult principles to which I shall briefly refer further on.Nevertheless, this mass of folklore belief is too overwhelming in quantity andtoo widely diffused to be dismissed lightly. Back of it all there must be someobjective realities and some fire for all this smoke. And we must not forgetthat there is one miraculous birth which is accepted throughout Christendom—thebirth of Jesus from a Divine Father and an earthly Virgin- Mother. Nevertheless,by the cultured heathen opponents of Justin, the story of the divine paternityof Jesus seems to have been regarded with a scorn similar to that with which weregard the above tales today, and that Church Father showed his wisdom when heplaced heathen and Christian stories upon the same logical basis. Am I not rightin saying that to impugn the possibility of marital relations between earthlywomen and heavenly bridegrooms is to strike at the very foundations ofChristianity? In folklore customs and fairy tales, fantastic though these may be, we findnumerous indications of the world-wide belief in bridegrooms and brides from theunseen world of spiritual beings, or, as they were termed in the middle ages,incubi and succubae.127 [index_split_019.html#filepos469523]We may set out with that description among the islanders of the Antilles, wherethey are the ghosts of the dead, vanishing when clutched; in New Zealand, whereancestral deities \"form attachments with females, and pay them repeated visits\";while in the Samoan Islands, such intercourse of mischievous inferior godscaused \"many supernatural conceptions\"; and in Lapland, where details of thislast extreme class have also been placed on record. From these lower grades ofculture the idea may be followed onward. Formal rites are specified in the Hindutantra which enable a man to obtain a companion—nymph—by worshipping her andrepeating her name by night in a cemetery.128[index_split_019.html#filepos469819]Among the Metamba negroes, a woman is bound hand and foot by the priest, whoflings her into the water several times over with the intention of drowning herhusband, a ghost, who may be supposed to be clinging to his unfeeling spouse.129[index_split_019.html#filepos470452]In China, it is not considered respectable for widows to remarry, for theexpress reason that their husbands are expected to return to them from the worldbeyond the grave and resume marital relations with them upon the Borderland.In the case of widows it would appear to be but a resumption of a relationpreviously established between the two upon earth. And there are indicationsthat the same stress is not laid upon passing preliminary ordeals as is the casewith the virgin, who \"has never known man.\" May it not be because of thevirgin's greater ignorance, physiologically speaking, so that she has to enterupon a more extended course of training than does the widow, who already hasexperience?The myths and fairy tales which speak of maidens with mysterious lovers from therealm of the unseen are certain to contain, so far as I have observed, referenceto some rule or pledge which the woman must strictly observe. If she fails to dothis, her lover vanishes, and she can find him again only after passing long andtoilsome ordeals. Such was the case with Psyche, who broke the command of herheavenly lover, Cupid, not to look upon him while he slept. He had come to hernight after night in the darkness, unseen, as is the wont with so many of theseheavenly bridegrooms; and she naturally desired to see his face. But, in hereagerness to know him more intimately, she let fall a drop of hot oil from thelamp upon him, which awoke him, and he vanished. This myth is an evidenteuphemism for a broken law of marital self-control. In other words, she wantedto enter upon the second step in the occult training which she was receivingfrom her husband, before she had fully mastered the first step. What those stepswere—first, second and third (for there is a third)—through which the earthlywife of a heavenly bridegroom must pass, will appear further on in this book.In one of the oldest of the Vedas—those books which contain the legends of theAryans before they split up into fragmentary races—we find a similar story aboutUrvasi and Pururavas.These two stories are usually explained as myths which show how the dawnvanishes as soon as it looks upon the sun. In solar myths, the dawn is oftentypified as a maiden, the sun-god being her lover who pursues her vanishing formthrough the heavens—an idea picturesquely brought out in the myth of Cinderella.If these two stories really are a bit of sun and dawn folklore then, Urvasi andPsyche must each be the dawn-maiden, and Pururavas and Cupid must be the sun-godon whose glorious form, unveiled by any clouds, the dawn-maiden dare not look,for, as she looks, the two lovers become separated—i.e., the dawn vanishesbefore the rising sun. But it is a little curious that in one story, the maidendisappears, while in the other it is the lover himself who flees. Obviouslythere is some other myth than a purely solar one involved in these twostories—stories so strikingly similar and yet so strikingly at variance in theone feature in which they should agree, if true sun and dawn myths.May not their likeness be due to their being memorials of the belief inBorderland marriages and in the self-control which is obligatory upon theearthly partner in such marriages? May not their unlikeness as to the sex of thepartner who disappears when that self-control is violated, be due to there beingheavenly brides, as well as heavenly bridegrooms?To these same myths, I take it, belong all those fairy stories of which Beautyand the Beast is the type. Here a maiden—noted, as a rule, for her amiabilityand gentleness—is served each day by invisible hands, and at night receives herlover in the form of a handsome prince. By the ordinary light of day he is amonster, appalling to behold, or, in some of the stories, he is invisible; butnight and the marriage couch cause him to materialize in his true shape.Finally, her family and friends—themselves quite outsiders as to theseexperiences—work upon her feelings and make her believe that this union is evil(in occult parlance, it would be termed diabolical) and she breaks off herconnection with him. In the end, true love triumphs, and the lovers arereunited—under happier auspices, that is, in the fairy story; in actual life, ittoo often happens that Beauty and the Beast are permanently separated bymeddling outsiders who ignorantly assume that everything which they cannotunderstand comes from the Devil. The poor earthly psychic has so constantlydinned into her ears the fact that her mediumship has revealed glimpses ofmonstrosities and deceptions, that she comes at last to fear lest her invisiblevisitor be in truth the evil demon which at times, by the sober light of day, heseems to be. All unaware of the law by which her own failures and peccadilloesbring about subjective hallucinations which mislead, she ascribes to her angelicbridegroom a tendency to evil which he does not possess, and finally comes toshrink from him as demoniacal. And the laws of Borderland forbid his undeceivingher so long as she hold fast to her prejudice as if it were gospel truth. ThusBeauty too often turns away from her princely lover forever, so far as thisearth-life is concerned, as Beauty, in the fairy story, did from the husbandwhom ignorant outsiders had led her to look upon as Beast.Pyramus and Thisbe, the lovers who, separated by a huge wall, were fain tosatisfy themselves with kisses exchanged through a hole therein, are aeuphemistic expression for those marital unions one of the parties to which isinvisible and his earthly love impalpable to the physical senses. In this storya bloodthirsty lion puts an end to the lovemaking. This is probably the solarlion, the meaning being that the ancient faith is superseded by the later and(in some respects) purer Sun Worship which seems to have been a reform movementof the science and materialism of the time against the Borderland sensualitywhich obtained in the declining age of Sex Worship.Isis and Osiris are also types of the husband and wife who unite upon theBorderland. Egyptian sacred traditions were wont to relate that Osiris waskilled by the Typhon, who then cut up his victim's body into fourteen pieces,enclosed it in an ark, and set it adrift upon the River Nile. Isis, theVirgin-Mother, sought far and wide for these remnants of her husband's body. Onelegend states that she found all, except the phallus; another, that she foundnothing except the phallus, and from that solitary fragment, she reconstructedher husband, entire. Here we evidently have two sides of the same esotericidea—that the loss of sex power constitutes the true death of the soul (not, ofcourse, the spirit) and that in the finding of one's marital partner on theBorderland the ghost may be gradually materialized into substantiality bybeginning at the same starting-point as did Isis.Heavenly bridegrooms, it will be noticed, predominate over heavenly brides inBorderland traditions. The reason, I take it, is that women, because of theirsocial environment, usually lead a more self-controlled and temperate life thanmen do, and thus are in most (though not all) respects more worthy of maritalunion with an angel. Custom allows men more freedom—a privilege which themasculine sex is not slow to avail itself of, especially in the direction ofwine, women and tobacco. These three dissipations not only exhaust the nerveforce of men, but blunt both their physical and their moral sensibilities; sothat the man for whom, in all possibility, his angel mate may be waiting uponthe Borderland, may find himself handicapped at the outset, should he ever essayan adventure into Borderland romance while still on the earth. In thisconnection we may remark that in India, where the attempt to obtain a spiritwife is said to be of common occurrence (and it would appear often rewarded withsuccess), we find a nation singularly gentle and peaceable in disposition,unaccustomed to drunkenness until taught it by outside peoples (there is aproverbial saying among the Hindus \"as drunk as a Christian\"), and endowed bynature with a tendency to aspire to union with God. Last, but not least, it is anation whose religions, for the most part, recognize the truth that sex is holy;and in this it is in strong contrast with our Western \"civilization,\" where themost sacred function of humanity is looked upon as vile. We Occidentals have awhole life's teaching to unlearn before we can approach the subject of maritalrelations on the Borderland from a natural and pure-minded standpoint.The chief tradition regarding spirit brides relates to Lilith or Lilis or Lilotand is mostly Rabbinical. As in the case of the angelic bridegrooms, she issupposed to be demoniacal. Lilith is said to have been Adam's first wife; onetradition says that by her he begat only demons; another says that she rebelledwhen Adam assumed authority over her and fled from him to the evil angel Samael,to whom she bore a demon progeny. Another legend has it that, being jealous ofEve, she slipped back into Eden behind the particeps criminis 130[index_split_019.html#filepos470765] in the temptation.Another says that Adam kept himself apart from Eve for a hundred years in ordernot to fill hell with their offspring; but that in a weak moment a female devil,called Lilith, seduced him and became his wife, and from their union arosedevils, ghosts and evil night dreams; and Eve in like manner became the wife ofa demon.131 [index_split_019.html#filepos471008] Of a similar tenor is thetradition about the Zoroastrian Yeina, who fell from a state of innocence bymeans of a great serpent, the Azis-Dahaka:> For a long period Yeina and his subjects were in the power of this evil> serpent, Azis-Dahaka, the demons. . . . Yeina himself in order to oblige his> masters, had to abandon his own wife, who was also his sister, and to take a> female devil for his wife, and to consent to the union of his former wife with> a demon. From these unions were produced apes, bears, and black men. During> this evil period women much preferred young devils to young men for husbands,> and men married young seductive \"Paris,\" or \"female devils.\"132> [index_split_019.html#filepos471332] The psychic who can sustain marital relation on the Borderland must above all besensitive at the extremities of the nerves of touch. Neither blind people nordeaf people are hindered by their respective infirmities from marrying in thisearth-life, and on the Borderland a psychic may be clairvoyant and clairaudientto only a limited extent, and yet be a partaker in connubial joys. For theBorderland husband must materialize more or less fully to enable her tounderstand the relation clearly upon the physical side: Whereas for most menthis is unnecessary, and the spirit bride may remain in all save a fewessentials, invisible, inaudible, intangible—a veritable \"woman of air.\" Henceher ghostliness and her philological connection with the idea of pale blue orpale purple—the color of air and the mist. Lilith is said to come to young mens' bedsides at night to seduce them, underthe aspect of a beautiful and finely dressed woman with golden hair. And,afterwards, she strangled them, and they are known to be Lilith's victimsbecause one of her golden hairs is found tightly wound around the victim'sheart. In the Zoroastrian legends, she is much connected with night andnight-dreams; and men are cautioned not to sleep alone for fear of the evils ofLilith. She also lies in wait for children to kill them if they are notprotected by \"Amulets.\"> Herodotus says that the Arabians called the moon \"Alilat,\" the Assyrian word> for night is Lilat, and Talbot supposes that the Arabians really called the> moon \"Sarrat ha Lilat,\" the queen of night.> > Mr. Talbot also says \"Alilat\" may also mean the star Venus.> > The Greeks considered Lilith evidently to be the moon, as with them she is> Ilithyia, the sister of Apollo, one of the birth goddesses. Night in Hebrew is> layelah.> > That the moon should be selected to represent the feminine principle is> readily accounted for by her waxing and waning propensities, to say nothing of> her controlling or coinciding with the feminine periods.133> [index_split_019.html#filepos471663] Summing up these varying traditions we find the following incidents prominent: 1. A woman who is not of the earth but evidently from an unknown world enters upon relations with Adam or with the men of later generations. 2. The relation is in most cases that of husband and wife and not a mere liaison. 3. {In those cases where the relation is illicit, the earthly partner comes to an unfortunate end.} 4. This woman from the unseen world is credited with being a seducer and a devil. 5. She bears no children save demons and is reputed to destroy children. 6. She causes men to dream evil dreams at night.Lilith is evidently the complement of the tradition about angelic bridegrooms.That the typical spirit bride should have so much more unsavory a reputationthan has the typical spirit bridegroom of nowadays. The masculine nature isproverbial for its lack of self-control where women are concerned, and in thisit has usually contrasted unfavorably with the self-control of women in similarcases. On the other hand, the men of our Western civilization are mostlysuperior to our women (of the virtuous classes) in the ardent, dramatic andartistic expression of love for the opposite sex—a desirable qualification inthe romance and uncertainties and trying ordeals of Borderland wedlock.If, therefore, the propositions which I have laid down as to the necessity forself-control in occult investigations be correct, we need not be surprised thatthe spirit bride is ere long denounced as demoniacal and seducing. But it is theignorance or the willful wrongdoing of her earthly lover that is to blame, andnot the spirit-bride—unless in some rare instance, where the celestial visitoris exceptionally careless. In that case, her superiors in the invisible worldinterfere and remove her. The connection with her earthly partner is snapped,never to be resumed, until he passes over to her world at death. But suchfailures on the part of the heavenly visitor are rare; and if the resultingphenomena are diabolical, it is the earthly medium's own fault.That she should bear no children except demons points to the proposition which Ihave already advanced: that children cannot be begotten from Borderland marriageunions. If the earthly husband still insists on doing all he can to beget suchchildren, he breaks the law of Borderland, and will be led deeper and deeperinto the mire of sensuality, and at last, perhaps be deceived by a subjectivehallucination of devils whom he will be told are his children. If he presses forinformation, he will probably receive a more explicit truthful statement: i.e.,that his spirit bride is unable to bear children on the Borderland of twoworlds. But should he fail about this time in some detail of moral duty, orclear-headedness, and especially should he insist in sowing seed where noharvest can be reaped, he will most certainly be misled by all sorts offantastic excuses. For such is the occult law. The psychic who, whetherignorantly or willfully, is unworthy, loses his grip on the lines ofcommunication, and his own ill-regulated subliminal consciousness then steps inwith its ingenious excuses—such as, perhaps, that his celestial partner isabnormally constituted as a woman, or that she kills their children as fast asthey are begotten, etc., etc. And thus, through the failure of the earthlyhusband to observe the laws of marital self-control on the Borderland, one moretradition is launched upon the world about the devil-bride who seduces men andbegets demons and kills children.That she should be credited with being the author of \"evil night-dreams\" showshow prone the partners of spirit brides have been to subjective hallucinations.We do not find any such wholesale charge brought against spirit husbands ofportraying evil dreams as is brought against Lilith. The imaginations of men'shearts must indeed have been evil in those days, and their brains beclouded, orthe difference between a materialized spirit bride and the subjective phantasmof an amorous dream would have been more sharply defined. The psychic whoconfounds two separate planes of existence has forsaken the path of self-controland clear-headedness, and has entered upon the path whose end is insanedelusion.In the supplement of Littré's Dictionnaire (1877) occurs a suggestive etymologyof the word lilac (or as it is in French, lilas). The writer connects the rootof this word with the Persian nil, indigo, and calls attention to the variousPersian words, nilah, niladj, liladj, lilandj, lilang, all relating to indigo.He connects the word lilas (French for lilac) with these words and also with thediminutive lilak (bluish, as fingers blued by the cold)—a tint which perfectlycharacterizes the flowers of the lilac of Persia which are of a pale purple. Maythere be some philosophical connection between this palely purple flower lilasand the ghostly \"Lilis\" or \"Lilat\" or \"Lilith?\"Lilith figures in a text of Isaiah: but we have to go both to Mohammedan and toAncient Greek folklore to find the connecting link between this text and theLilith of Rabbinical traditions. The text refers to the destruction which theLord threatens will befall Eden, and reads:> And thorns shall come up in her palaces, nettles and thistles in the> fortresses thereof; and it shall be an habitation of jackals, a court for> ostriches. And the wild beasts of the desert shall meet with the wolves {or> howling creatures}, and the satyr {or he-goat} shall cry to his fellow: yea;> the night-monster shall settle there, and shall find her a place of rest.134> [index_split_019.html#filepos471973] The word \"night-monster\" is, in Hebrew, \"Lilith.\" The King James versiontranslates this word \"screech-owl\"; the Vulgate, \"Lamia\"; in Luther's Bible,\"Kobold.\" Lamia or Lamya is found in the Great Bible, and in Coverdale's,Matthew's, Beck's and the Bishop's Bible.Now a Lamia is a mythical serpent-woman of a demoniacal character. Philostratus,in his Life of Apollonius of Tyana, gives a memorable instance. A young man onthe road near Corinth met a charming woman who invited him to her house in thesuburbs of the city, and said that if he would remain with her, \"he would hearher sing and play, and drink such wine as never any drank, and no man shouldmolest him; but she being fair and lovely would live and die with him.\"135[index_split_019.html#filepos472241] The young man was, as Burton in his Anatomyof Melancholy puts it, in giving the account, \"a philosopher, otherwise staidand discreet, able to moderate his passions, though not this of love,\" and he\"tarried with her awhile to his great content.\"136[index_split_019.html#filepos472558] At last he married her. To the wedding cameApollonius, and he at once recognized her as a Lamia, and declared that all herfurniture was but illusion. She wept and begged Apollonius to be silent, but hepersisted in exposing her, whereupon she, her house and its content vanished.This is probably a Beauty and the Beast myth on the masculine side, Apolloniusplaying the part of the outsider who separates the lovers by harping on thethings which are illusory and monstrous in the young man's psychicmanifestations. It is worth noticing in this connection, that the young man hadbeen living a temperate and self-controlled life when he was first approached bythis Lamia or Lilith, so that he was evidently found worthy to taste the joys ofaffectionate connubial intercourse with his mysterious bride. Here evidently,the young man is not strong enough to endure the training required to consummateBorderland wedlock. He also, evidently, does not have his subconsciousness wellunder control, but allows it to run away with him. Mastery of self in everypossible aspect—physically, intellectually, morally, affectionally—is one of tworequisites for sustained marital relations on the Borderland; the otherrequisite being steadfast aspiration to personal communion with the Divine.The Mohammedan Idea of the Evil Church Yard: Lilith Crops Up in Ireland > The ancient Churchyard of Truagh, county Monaghan, is said to be haunted by an> evil spirit, whose appearance generally forebodes death. The legend runs,> writes Lady Wilde,137 [index_split_019.html#filepos472820] \"that at funerals> the spirit watches for the person who remains last in the graveyard. If it be> a young man who is there alone, the spirit takes the form of a beautiful young> girl, inspires him with an ardent passion, and exacts from him a promise that> he will meet her that day month in the churchyard.

Richard F. Burton's translation of the Arabian Nights occurs a story ofa female desert-monster, called Ghulah, who devours human flesh. Captain Burton,in a footnote, remarks: > The Ghúlah (fem. of ghúl) is the Hebrew lilith or lilis; the classical lamia;> the Hindu yogini and dakini; the Chaldean utug and gigim, (desert-demons) as> opposed to the mas(hill-demon) and telal (who steal into towns); the ogress of> our tales and the bala yaga 139 [index_split_019.html#filepos473402]> (Grannywitch) of Russian folklore. Etymologically ghul is a calamity, a panic> fear; and the monster is evidently the embodied horror of the grave and the> graveyard.140 [index_split_019.html#filepos473674] In its more usual spelling of \"Ghoul,\" this graveyard monster will probably befamiliar to most readers. > The female ghul . . . appears to men in the deserts, in various forms,> converses with them, and sometimes prostitutes herself to them.141> [index_split_019.html#filepos473998] Here we see the (1) spirit bride, degraded to the level of a harlot, (2) vagueand unreasoning terror, (3) loathing and horror of the spirits of the deceasedall meeting under one name. So far has Lilith, the Borderland bride, fallen fromher rightful estate by reason of the befogged imaginations of mankind. > The shiqq is another demoniacal creature, having the form of half a human> being (like a man divided longitudinally); and it is believed that the nasnas> is the offspring of a shiqq and of a human being. . . . The nasnas is> described as having half a head, half a body, one arm, and one leg, with which> it hops with much agility.142 [index_split_019.html#filepos474331] This is another form of the giant progeny of Borderland unions—a form sofantastic as to show that its origin is a subjective hallucination, and not anobjective reality. In other words, the Mohammedan shiqq and nasnas are both ofthem probably the subliminal invention of some imperfect earthly psychic in thecenturies agone, who broke the Borderland law in his or her relations with aspirit bride, or a spirit husband, and who was grossly misled, in consequence,by his or her own subliminal self. That others since then claim from time totime to see these fantastic creatures does not prove that they exist. Inpsychical matters nothing is more common than for people to see ghosts at agiven time and place when their imaginations have been worked up to theexpectation of seeing one then and there, of a certain predetermined type.The Mohammedan Paradise as well as its Borderland recognizes love between thesexes. And in this it differs from the Christian Paradise as popularlyconceived—although as I have elsewhere shown, the statement by Jesus that weshall be, after death, as regards marrying, like \"the angels in heaven,\" whentaken in connection with the next in Genesis about the sons of God who weddedearthly women, shows pretty conclusively that the Christian Scriptures admit theexistence of sex and marriage in the world beyond the grave. Nevertheless, theChurch has chosen to flatly contradict the teaching of both the Old and the NewTestament in this, with the result of blinding Christians utterly to thesepotent Scriptural truths. Mohammed, on the other hand, was sufficient of a seerto venture on restoring the ancient doctrine.Heaven, as is well known, abounds in love-making; beautiful women called hourisattending upon the risen soul of the male Mohammedan as he reclines at feast. Itis true that apologists have suggested a figurative sense in which the accountsof Mohammed's Paradise are to be taken.On the contrary, it is not at all remarkable. It was precisely because Mohammedwas at that time living a fairly well-ordered and self-controlled life that hewas enabled to learn sufficient of the world beyond the grave to assert thatlove between the sexes survives death and is one of the potent factors in sociallife there, as here. It is true that, being an Oriental, his \"revelations\" wouldinevitably conform to his cast of mind, so that the glitter and luxuriousabandon of a feast presided over by houris might seem to him the acme of idealbliss. But beneath and permeating all this voluptuous imagining breathes themighty truth of sex-love in Paradise: that love which mutually strengthens andmutually uplifts as no other love in all the world can strengthen and uplift. Itake it as the chief reason for its existence—the propagation of the speciesbeing of necessity incidental, therefore, secondary. But there is also a thirdreason which, unfortunately, is known to but few. Nor is it likely to beunderstood as it should be. The third reason for the marital union is that, forthose who are worthy, it is, whether on the Borderland or the earthly plane, thesur- est and safest method of seeking union with the Divine Heart of theUniverse and becoming one with all God's world. Only in giving joyful thanks toGod, indeed, should that relation ever be entered upon. This, not only becauseit is fitting to give thanks to God, but because it is beautiful at that time,and because only those who have experienced the bliss of taking God into themarital partnership in its most intimate relation can be said either to be trulywedded or to truly realize what it is to love God, and be in return beloved byHim. This applies in earthly as well as Borderland wedlock.Trite and commonplace as may seem this suggestion to give thanks to God in thisrelation and share one's joy with Him, it nevertheless appears to be the inner,sacred truth of all religions on their esoteric side, and of all mysticisms andforms of occult teaching, the world over—a truth which has been jealously hiddenaway from the masses. It has been concealed for several reasons, probably.First, it is not a matter to be attained at once, but requires systematic andcareful training in self-control. And some degree of intellectual and spiritualinsight is necessary to rate this training at its just value, as well as torespect the sacredness of the idea which underlies it. There are three degreesto be passed in this training, of which I will speak later on.Second, inasmuch as it enhances, instead of extinguishing, connubial pleasure,while at the same time it puts the begetting of children absolutely under thecontrol of parents—and this, without violation of either civil or naturallaws—its initiates evidently feared lest it be turned to base uses by theunscrupulous and licentious. A needless fear, this, however; as to thelibertine, the game will never seem worth the candle; while, should he perseverein the training so as to become an adept in the third and last degree, he willbe no longer a libertine.Third. There is a belief among some occultists that an earnest wish, breathed atthat time when husband and wife are one, will not fail to be granted. Thisopens, it is said, the door to those who practice what is called \"black magic,\"and enables them to work harm upon other human beings. What foundation there isfor this belief as applied to the magicians I do not see. If it really be that awish is granted then more readily than when the seeker is in any other mood, itis probably because the occultist who attains the second degree has to exercisesuch supreme self-control at that moment that he is complete master of hissubconsciousness. And if he has attained the third degree, he is in rapport withSpirit throughout the universe, so that his desire is granted because he desiresonly what is in harmony with Good and Right. That a black magician should beable at such a moment to enter upon harmonious relations with the universe bybreathing a curse seems to me very unlikely. I am of the opinion that thisbelief is due to the mistaken idea that correct living and clear thinking areunnecessary to establish lines of accurate communication with the unseen world.And, because occultists have usually assumed the nearness of a world of devils,rather than of a world of angels, and because they have assumed that depravityand prejudice offer no bar to communication with the unseen, whether good orevil, it was a most natural conclusion that it would be dangerous to entrust thesecret of the third degree to a \"black magician.\" But, so long as a man is ablack magician, he will fail to enter upon the third degree. This last degreeis, I am firmly convinced, impossible, whether in earthly or Borderland wedlock,for either man or woman who does not live a pure life in self-control andaspiration to the Divine. And the occultist who seeks to attain to the thirddegree must first become a white magician.Nevertheless, as I have said, the initiates in the third degree have guardedthis secret most jealously, and apparently for the reasons I have assigned.The first and second degree, however, seem to have been taught publicity insymbolic rites—such as for instance in that much misunderstood dance at theColumbian Exposition—the Danse du Ventre. It was noticeable that the Orientalmen, one and all, viewed that dance with serious and at times reverent gaze.This fact was brought to my notice by two ladies (school teachers) who knewabsolutely nothing of the Sex Worship symbolism of the dance, but who hadconcluded, simply from thoughtful observation, that there must be some religiousand pure-minded motif back of it all. Nevertheless, most Americans andEuropeans, whether men or women, failed to penetrate beneath the surface of thismarkedly symbolic dance, owing to the Occidental habit of thought which seesnaught but impurity in the most important and sacred function of our nature. InOriental countries, however, despite their being \"heathen,\" sex is looked on asholy; in this connection, our phrase, \"Give God the glory,\" takes on itself avaster significance than is ever taught from our pulpits.It is no wonder, then, the Oriental occultists should have penetrated at anearly date to the underlying principles of marital relations on the Borderland.From their lifelong habits of thought, they viewed sex as simply and naturallyas we should view the circulation of our own blood—as a curious phenomenon ofabsorbing personal interest. With no false shame to overcome, they were fittedto receive the higher truths concerning this subject, whereas our Occidentalmediums, for the most part, receive words of impurity or are misled into a looselife. The difference is due to the exact antipodal standpoints of Occidental andOriental psychics on the subject of the holiness of sex.I have said that the initiates of the third degree seem to have made this theinner secret of their mysteries, the world over, and that they have alwaysjealously guarded this secret from the masses. I am inclined to think that inthe beginning it may not have been so, but that this jealous care may have beenthe result of a bitter lesson learned of the unwisdom of throwing pearls beforeswine, not because the swine turn and rend one—for the earnest teacher of truthnever gives his own danger a second thought—but because the swine are too apt tosoil the pearls by trampling them in the mire.If it be asked in amazement how this teaching of \"Giving God the Glory,\" andsharing with Him the supreme joy of the marital relation, could become sodegraded by swinish human beings as to cause its teachers to withhold it infuture from the masses, I answer:By turning it into a commercial transaction with God.The piggish, greedy man, learning by hearsay of the connubial bliss attendingthe Triune partnership with God, pressed eagerly forward with one thoughtuppermost: \"I will pay God cash down for so much of my pleasure, and I mean todrive a close bargain with him.\"The voluptuary, seeking to enhance his physical sensations, likewise pressedforward, saying to himself in an outburst of generosity: \"God shall receive fromme every whit as much as He gives me.\"The sentimental but selfish mystic, ever yearning for a new subjectiveexperience, likewise pressed forward, thinking: \"I shall get acquainted with Godon intimate terms by dividing up my pleasure with Him.\"Be not deceived: God is not mocked: Whatsoever a man soweth he shall reap. Andeach of these types failed to get what they expected in pleasure, because itcannot be secured by any means but by love.Now, these would-be initiates not only failed to get so much physical pleasurefor so much tithing paid over to Him, but they [were] tempted by that veryfailure to enter upon what we may call (to put it euphemistically) a bargain.The nervous system had been wrought to too high a pitch not to insist upon apurchase in some market—if not in God's market, then in the Devil's. Hence, Ifancy, too often abnormal vices and abominations of ancient Sodom and Gomorrah,of the Orient today and the Roman Empire, when Christianity first turned itspurifying (though salty) current through the Augean stables of latter-daysex-worship.For this the initiates who held the whole truth, among other reasons no doubt,usually shrank from revealing even glimpses of it to anyone who had not passed along probation. According to the Talmud, the ancient Hebrews had three names toexpress the idea of God, the first of which was interdicted to the great number.Sages taught it once a week to their sons and their disciples. The second was atfirst taught to everybody. \"But,\" said Maimonides, \"when the number of theungodly had increased, it was entrusted only to the most discreet among thepriests, and they repeated it in a low tone to their brethren, while the peoplewere receiving the benediction.\"143 [index_split_019.html#filepos474606] Thethird name for God \"contained,\" says Jacolliot, \"the great secret of theuniversal soul, and stood for, if we may so express it, the highest degree ofinitiation.\"144 [index_split_019.html#filepos474922] Regarding this last,Maimonides says:> It was only taught to a man of recognized discretion, of mature age, not> addicted to anger or intemperance, a stranger to vanity, and gentle and> pleasant with all with whom he was brought in contact.145> [index_split_019.html#filepos475189]> > > > \"Whoever,\" says the Talmud, \"has been made acquainted with this secret and> vigilantly keeps it in a pure heart, may reckon upon the love of God and the> favor of men; his name inspires respect; his knowledge is in no danger of> being forgotten, and he is the heir to two worlds, that in which we live and> the world to come.\"146 [index_split_019.html#filepos475456] All of which applies to the earthly partner of a celestial bride or bridegroom,when the laws of correct living and clear thinking are obeyed. Those who knowthis secret and vigilantly keep it in a pure heart are indeed the heir of bothworlds, for they dwell upon the Borderland, harmoniously adapting their lives toboth planes of existence; and, being at one with God, they can each say, \"If Godbe for me, who can be against me?\" Nor is the reward for making a proper use ofthis Great Secret confined to Borderland wedlock; its Kingdom may come on theearthly plane itself to worthy neophytes. It was probably to keep the knowledge of this secret from the unworthy that theancient mysteries of Isis and of Eleusis were designed. For this purpose, also,the sacred scriptures of all religions—not excepting the Hebrew and theChristian—seem to have introduced stories and aphorisms which should convey onemeaning to an outsider, and quite another to an initiate.> Woe to the man who looks upon the law as a simple record of events expressed> in ordinary language, for, if really that is all it contains, we can frame a> law much more worthy of admiration.

The expression \"Thesecret of the combination by twos and threes\" has probably a double meaninghere—the esoteric meaning turning upon the two kinds of marital partnershipknown to the initiates, husband and wife being the \"combination by two\" (in thesecond degree), and husband, wife and God—three in one, a sacred trinity inunity—being the \"combination by three\" (in the third and highest degree). Andthey who have once realized the blessedness of this triune partnership will moveheaven and earth to make it renewable at will—so much sweeter and more helpfulin every way is it than the mere \"combination by two.\" Now, because sex is distinctly emotional in its manifestations, there is alwaysa tendency, with failure to reach the highest, to allow the emotions to slumpdown, as it were, to a lower level. Few natures are so supremely self-controlledas to say, at a critical moment, \"the highest—or nothing. I will wait for that!\"And so, the types I have mentioned above as failure—the piggish man, thevoluptuary and the sentimental, selfish mystic—when, because of the delicatebalance required of the initiate who would enter on the third degree, theyslipped off their pivot, fell quite outside the circle of what is lawful, sureand normal, to [what is] chaotic, unlawful and horribly vile. From this datesmuch of the black magic. And this was the controlling subjective influence whichmade witchcraft a very real, objective terror to the victims of the witchesduring the Middle Ages. There is little doubt that many of the witches didpractice a sorcery of the most diabolical type—a sorcery based upon theprinciples of hypnotic suggestion, and of the willful projection of the astralor double; a sorcery whose object was to cause evil, and which did cause evil inmany cases where the victims were not protected from occult mischief—working byliving pure and upright lives; a sorcery, finally, whose impelling motive wasdue to insane hallucinations, resulting in a very large number of cases fromhaving violated the laws of right living in sex relations on the Borderland. Itis probable that many of these witches passed the second degree, while few, ifany, gained the third—the inner degree where aspiration in mingled purity andpassion to union with God is [the] chief factor. Some of the attributes of awitch (we need not enumerate them all: the literature of the subject isvoluminous) were: 1. That she sustained or was supposed to sustain occult sex relations with the Prince of the Powers of the Air, Yclept the Devil. 2. That she received on some part of her body a devil's mark or stigma, which was his seal of authority over her and which seems to have been hypnotically rendered insensible to pain. There were men, who did a business in discovering witches by pricking a suspected woman's body all over with a pin until they found some place insensible to the pain of the prick, when they would triumphantly announce this to be the \"Devil's Mark.\" 3. That the Devil or one of his imps at times visited her in the guise of some animal—a dog, a cat, even a huge butterfly, to suck some part of her body, and that, whatever the part of her body chosen, it and no other spot was always resorted to by the impish creature thereafter. Sometimes witnesses testify to seeing these animals familiar, as in the case of a witch ill in bed who was being closely watched. The witness, who was on guard, testified with much detail of circumstance to having seen a huge \"fly,\" like a miller, which buzzed in among the hair of the sick woman and after a while flew away, when the witch called to the witness to lift up her hair, that she might show a sore place on the scalp which she said was where the Devil, in the form of a fly, was wont to suck her. 4. That she could work harm to people at a distance by what appears to have been hypnotic suggestion, and that she usually was wickedly and viciously inclined to do this, at will. 5. That she could appear in what seems to have been her double, or astral form, to her victims.Now, regarding this last, the extremely critical and level-headed Society forPsychical Research have collected some three thousand cases of apparitions ofliving doubles at the present day, all of them well-attested by witnesses. Mostof these apparitions (some of which were so like real flesh and blood as to betaken for the person himself), according to the Society's records, werespontaneous, only a few being deliberately self-induced—a fact which indicatesthat the projection of the double is probably a normal power and that it oughtto be, therefore, not so very difficult for an illiterate old woman to acquire.A few apparitions of doubles seem to be due mostly to one of the followingcauses: 1. Violent shock, as a runaway accident, danger of drowning. 2. A state of health indicative of approaching death, so that the astral forms (is this the soul, the body of the immortal spirit?) seems already poised for flight. 3. The moment of separation of soul and body, especially if caused by drowning, suffocation, contusion on the head, wounds received in battle, etc. 4. Falling into \"a brown study\": gazing fixedly at an object in an abstracted way (self-hypnotization); listening abstractedly to a continuous and monotonous sound. 5. Falling asleep with an earnest desire fixed in one's mind to visit such or such a person or place. Any of these may be induced accidentally and, so far as we know, without the conscious will of the ego. 6. Deliberately willing, under some of the above circumstances, to have one's double appear at such and such a place. This act may or may not include—according to the extent of the psychic's training—an after-memory of the event.From the above it will be seen that the apparition of the double, whetherspontaneously or deliberately induced, seems to be brought about by a suddenfocusing of mental force. I am inclined to think that some of the surestvouchers for the material objective substantiality of the world beyond the gravewill be found among the phenomena attending the appearance of the double;inasmuch as the double, when most clearly manifesting, comforts itself like anearthly being with earthly necessities, and if this double be, as appears,identical with the soul-body which quits our mortal frame at death, we have onlyto collate and compare instances of the earthly double, and acquire the art ofprojecting our own double intelligently and without loss of memory while inearth-life, and we shall know beyond all doubt what its habits of thought, itsappetites and necessities are likely to be beyond the grave. In the witchcraftdays, what is called repercussion was a common phenomenon. That is, the witchwho appeared in astral form to her victims, if wounded with a knife, might beafterwards found to have sustained a similar wound in her physical body. Thiscarries out the idea of the Theosophists and other occultists, that thought haspower over matter, and that our physical frame is in reality molded by thespirit and soul which inhabit it. Col. Olcott151[index_split_019.html#filepos477083] gives an interesting account ofrepercussion in his own case.152 [index_split_019.html#filepos477378]Instances are not wanting where the earthly double has shown that its sexcapacity remains apparently unaffected by temporary separation from the body.The following case, though probably founded on the falsehood of a clever woman,shows with what serious respect the phenomenon of the double was viewed somethree hundred and fifty years ago.> In the Dictionnaire Infernal, 153 [index_split_019.html#filepos477751] . . .> there is, s.v. Fécondité, a report of a trial before the Parliament of> Grenoble, in which the question was, whether a certain infant could be> declared legitimate which was born after the husband had been absent from his> wife four full years.

Midwives and physicians were consulted, and reported on the> subject. As a result, the Parliament ordained that the infant should be> adjudged legitimate, and that its mother should be regarded as a true and> honorable wife. The judgment bears date 13th February 1537.154> [index_split_019.html#filepos478057] The following incident was told to me by a gentleman who had heard it from thelips of one of the parties. For obvious reasons, I suppress localities: > A gentleman who was intensely dark, of a Spanish type, was in love with a girl> of the true blonde type. They never married but later on she married someone> else and moved to another part of the country. One night this gentleman had a> very vivid dream, in which he fancied himself to be her husband.

A little child, a decided brunette, ran up to him, exclaiming> joyfully, \"Papa, Papa!\" \"Well!\" laughed the host, \"I am glad that she has> found someone to call 'Papa,' for she steadfastly refuses to recognize me as> such.\" Whereupon the lady appropriately fainted. The visitor learned> afterwards by making inquiries of her, that she had had a dream similar to his> at the same time, and just nine months previous to the birth of the child. Was this a case of repercussion? Did his double meet her double (but not herphysical self) on the astral plane, and was that thought-world more powerful inmolding her child than was her physical environment as a wife? Or was it merelya telepathic impression conveyed from his mind to hers with sufficient vividnessto \"mark\" the child? I may here remark, that I do not consider the theory thathe was the physical father of the child, as it seems to me that that would be aviolation of the natural laws of Borderland. Nevertheless, if he really was thephysical father, the stories would only be in keeping with the stories of thegiant progeny from angelic fathers, and the stories of women confined in hightowers and yet becoming pregnant by a celestial visitor. In the case of Danae,her visitor materialized as a shower of gold—quite after the fashion of modernapparitions of spiritualistic séances where the spirits often materialize asfloating masses of radiant mist. At recent séances, too, trained scientificobservers have perceived the medium's double (I now speak of mediums who are notfraudulent and who are willing to submit to experimental tests) partially orwholly dissociated from the medium's physical self. Col. Olcott gives aninteresting account of his double oozing through the walls of Mrs. Blavatsky'sroom on its way to the sitting-room to add three words to a MS. on which he hadbeen busily writing just before retiring. Both the earthly double and thecelestial spirit appear to possess this faculty of oozing through blank walls.May they not be one and the same? In that case, we see how easy it may be toconfound spirit bridegrooms from the world beyond the grave (who cannot begetchildren on the Borderland because this would be a violation of natural law),and astral doubles of earthly lovers who can stimulate the begetting of childrenupon the astral double of an earthly woman so vividly as to mark the child ofher lawful husband and herself with the likeness of the astral lover. At this point it may be objected that such information as I am here givingshould not be spread broadcast, lest unscrupulous libertines take advantage ofthis power of projecting the double to get innocent girls into their power,since high towers and bolted doors appear to offer no barrier to the double'sentrance. It is precisely for this reason that this information should be widelycirculated, in order that these possibilities may be made known to the generalpublic and guarded against. The present flood of Theosophic and other popularoccult literature, as well as the published records of the S.P.R., have alreadyplaced the knowledge of this power within the reach of the libertine, if hechooses to avail himself of it. When he can have this for the asking, it is hightime that the general public know something of it also, as well as of the factthat correct living and clear thinking will always protect us from evil inducedby occult means. It is an interesting question, however, as to whether childrencould really be begotten by a double upon a virgin, or, as in the case triedbefore the Grenoble parliament, upon a married woman whose husband is away. I aminclined to think not, since the double is for the time being on a differentplane of matter from the physical body of the woman—being, in fact, in the sameworld as it will be after death—so that it must obey the law of the Borderlandquite as much as if it were an angelic bridegroom, which is to sow no seed,inasmuch as no harvest can be reaped therefrom. But in this case, what becomesof the scientific basis of such stories as Danae and other virgins who becomethe mothers of children by a Borderland lover—whether earthly double or heavenlyangel? There is but one way, so far as I see, by which a Borderland bridegroomcould beget a child by an earthly woman. The woman must live each moment instrict obedience to the laws of her earth-life, and also of his heavenly life.She must be capable of appreciating the intellectual thought of his advancedworld. She must understand and live in accordance with the higher code of ethicscurrent in his realm. She must neglect no earthly duty; she must be conversantwith the intellectual thought-world of her earthly associates; she must notcrush out a single instinct of her nature, but properly use every physicalappetite and passion to round out a symmetrical earthly life. When emergenciesarise on either the earthly plane or on the Borderland, she must never make amistake, for to do so will cause the lines of communication to waver andpresently to part. In short, her life—judged not only by the highest earthlystanding but by the more advanced standard in the world beyond the grave—must beabsolutely perfect if she is to conceive, gestate for nine long months and givebirth to a child begotten by a Borderland father; that is, she must bepsychically on the same plane with him, and at the same time fulfill the laws ofboth planes, and that without a single break. Only thus were the laws on theBorderland obeyed.The Roman Catholic Church, in its dogma of the Immaculate Conception, claimsperfection for the blessed Virgin Mary. In so doing, it shows its wisdom. ThoughI am by no means a Romanist, I emphatically say that, from the occultstandpoint, the immaculate life of Mary, for a long period prior to theAnnunciation and until at least the birth of Jesus, is the only foundation uponwhich the possibility of the mysterious conception of Jesus as a Borderlandchild can rest. Having once attained this high plane, it is unlikely that shewould ever descend to a lower plane afterward: so that, accurately speaking, theRoman Catholic doctrine of her immaculate life must have been absolutely perfecton all points, or she could not have conceived a child by the spirit of God; forGod does not break his own laws. Nor is it likely that the heavenly bridegroomwould break his laws in order to beget a child upon an earthly woman, providedthat woman were suitably trained for some time for the occult espousal, andprovided that God has a tangible form, as He appeared to Moses to have when Hehad Moses remain in the cleft of a rock while He passed by. (Exodus 33:21,23.)This is the strength of the one Catholic doctrine concerning Mary'sstainlessness of life; and from the Apocryphal Gospels, it appears that Mary hadhad the advantage of being brought up as an orphan in the temple under the eyesof the priests. It was customary for her to see and talk with angels and toreceive food from them before her espousal to Joseph. My own idea of it,however, is that such a conception—if conception there were—would require Mary'smentality to rise not only to the standard of an angel but to the omniscienceand all pervading tenderness of God, in order for her to be so thoroughly hisspouse on the Borderland as to conceive and bear a child to him. On the otherhand, it is interesting to note, in connection with this, the record in theApocryphal Gospels as to the appearance of an angel visitor to Mary in the guiseof a handsome youth, and the opinion expressed to Joseph by the virgins left incharge of her during Joseph's absence, that it was the angel who had made herpregnant.Perhaps when we come into harmonious rapport with the mystical theory,popularized by the school of Divine Science and other mystics, that each one ofus is a part of the universal mind, and that that mind may know all things inthe universe, we might allow even this on the Borderland. However, the RomanCatholic Church has seemingly provided for the high standard of mentalityrequired from a spouse of Divine Science on the Borderland by ascribing to Marynot only the name, but the attributes, of \"Mother of God.\"In The Perfect Way, or the Finding of Christ, written by Anna Kingsford andEdward Maitland, occurs a remark about \"the notion, far from uncommon, that byabjuring the ordinary marriage relation, and devoting herself wholly to herastral associate, a woman may, in the most literal sense, become an immaculatemother of Christs.\"155 [index_split_019.html#filepos478385] It is needless toadd that the authors deprecate this, but their remarks show their totalmisapprehension of Borderland sex-relations, since it is only between husbandand wife that those relations can exist objectively; all else is but subjectiveillusion. And, therefore, the command of Mary's Heavenly Bridegroom that Josephwas not to approach her as a husband until after the birth of the mysteriouslybegotten child would be strictly in keeping with Borderland laws, because it isthe highest ideal of both worlds.The mediaeval witch, as well as the Blessed Virgin, had her chance of Borderlandnuptials on a high plane; but, unlike Mary, she failed to pass those ordealswhich require correct living and clear thinking on the part of the earthlypsychic. In the first place, the witch (poor woman) lived in days when thephysiological relations of husband and wife occupied a far lower place inpopular estimation than it did in the days of Mary, and moreover, in the Orient,Mary's home, the relation of husband and wife had then, and still has, aholiness on its physiological side which is foreign to European or Americanhabits of thought. When the peculiar psychical experiences of the witch set in,therefore, she naturally jumped to the conclusion that, first, they were sinful;second, that, being sinful, they were the work of Satan. These assumptions werea departure from clear, unprejudiced thinking, and from that moment began herdiabolical illusions, and she saw monsters, hobnobbed with imps, was lashed byscorpions, etc., etc., to the full extent of her willingness to receive theseillusions as objective realities. The poor creature indeed had not ouradvantages in the perusal of records of hypnotism and of the Society forPsychical Research, and would have been sadly puzzled to draw the line betweensubjective illusion and objective materialization. Nevertheless, her angel loverwas with her when she thought him the Devil. He comforted her in her poverty andloneliness (many of these witches, remember, were old women, whose lives hadbeen the bare, dreary lives of the terrible poor), and he promised her suchinfluence among her neighbors as she longed for most. This was an ordeal, hadshe but known it, which, if passed successfully, would have brought her a higherand sweeter pleasure. Some there were, here and there, who seem to have chosenthe better part, and to have become \"white witches,\" capable of clairvoyance, ofhealing human beings and cattle of strange diseases, forecasting the future andthe like. But usually, these poor old women had been so embittered againstselfish or heedless neighbors, that the influence they longed for most was topay back their wrongs (real or supposed) with interest. Here again, they brokethe occult law which calls for correct living on the part of the psychic, andtrod the downward path of hatred and diabolism. In many cases, no doubt, thepsychical experiences of a witch started from this fierce desire to be revengedupon those who had slighted her. She probably began with some simple form ofself-hypnotization imparted to her by a neighbor who had already acquired someproficiency in the art. Once she had accomplished this, the astral world layopen wide before her with all its illusions or all its realities, according tohow she proved worthy of one or the other. Sometimes, no doubt, she struggledupward to benevolent thoughts and prayers for help in resisting temptation andwas accordingly rewarded with true occult power, and with union with her angelicmate, who was both her husband and her guardian. That she thought him the Devilpartially interfered with the physical strengthening and psychical happinesswhich that union brought; while he, on his part, kept steady watch over herinfirmities, always ready to help the slightest impulse of her spirit to rise tohigher things, seeing, as only angels see, beneath that misshapen earthly body,the soul—the astral body which, despite the temporary disfigurements caused byevil thoughts, is ever young and fair—and waiting patiently throughout her poor,stumbling, sinful life, as only a man who truly loves a wife can wait, for thetime when she will live down her mistakes, and see as clearly as himself.If it be objected that this occult wedlock with an angel whom she igno- rantlymistook for a Devil brought her misfortune, I answer: Not unless she broke thelaw of correct living by trying to turn her occult powers to base purposes, orfailed to keep clear-headed.But in that case?In that case, also, her guardian angel took her through the deep waters andalong the rugged, toilsome mountain path for her evolution, that she might bemade perfect through suffering. Are we not all convinced that that is what Godmeans by putting us, who are not witches, in a world where each of us has towrestle with adverse circumstances in bitterness of spirit? In our inmost beingwe recognize God's wisdom in our being taken through sorrows, temptations andconflicts, for thus only can we grow strong and rise to our full stature as madein His likeness. And to the witch, Heaven was no less merciful than to us, inthat it forced ordeals upon her which, when she passed them, brought herhappiness, but which, when she failed to pass them, brought her suffering.It is noticeable that most of the witches who came to grief, and who confessedto intercourse with the Devil, referred to certain ceremonies customary at each\"Sabbath,\" although records of witchcraft point rather to subjective illusionsof performing abominable rites, which symbolized abnormal vices. For details,the reader may refer to almost any work on witchcraft. He will there see, thatwith all the fuss made by the judges and persecutors about this intercourse withSatan, there was very little of real impurity, and what there was seems to havebeen entirely subjective—the illusion of an insane imagining. In short, thewitch, as well as other brides of angelic lovers, was evidently far fromimpure-minded by nature at the start, and this, too, in an age of vulgarexpressions, coarse ideas, and from which even the genius of a Shakespeare didnot escape without contamination. Yet these women were mostly illiterate andmiserably poor. It is probable that their poverty, however, had been theireducator in ascetic deprivation and in bearing up under slights from morefortunate neighbors, and so had laid the foundations of that stern control ofself which is absolutely necessary in the true occultist. That thisfeature—their feelings under slights received from neighbors—played an importantpart in their thoughts and consequently in their development, is shown by thefact that many of their attempts (real or supposed) at bewitching date from anunkind refusal of a neighbor to give them a bowl of soup or an old shirt.Illtemper, then, morose broodings over wrongs, general sourness of spirit, werenot the least important of the causes which turned those earthly partners ofangelic bridegrooms into devil-handed witches.Another cause seems to have been their failure to think clearly and withoutprejudice. Poor creatures! They were nearly all of them prejudiced (i.e.,\"prejudgers\") from beginning to end. They prejudged angels to be the Devil; theyprejudged the monsters imagined by their own subconsciousness to be real; theyprejudged the wedlock into which they entered on the Borderland to be sinful;they prejudged their mysterious visitor to be a tempter to lead them away fromreligion and the church; they prejudged him as requiring unhallowed rites—dimlyremembered survivals from the ancient Sex Worship, too often on its vilest side;they prejudged him as the means of ignoble satisfactions of their hatred andtheir animal desires. And thus they sank to diabolism.There was yet another cause—not so much of evil as of illusions. This was the\"Devil's Mark,\" that special mark of his with which they supposed themselvesstamped on some part of their bodies. With this, we may classify the spot atwhich the Devil or one of his imps was said to suck them, and also thepeculiarity that their bridegroom, in his marital relations, chilled them asthough with ice.There are many phases of occult sensitiveness. The ear for the clairaudient, theeye for the clairvoyant, the easily-swayed arm and hand for the writing medium,are the three physical organs through which communications usually reach us. Butfor the wife of a heavenly bridegroom, the nerves of touch, it is evident, mustbe the chief focuses of occult sensitiveness. Now, in order that the delicatebalance of nerve sensation be maintained, it is important that such a psychicdistinguish readily between real touches and illusory touches, between objectiverealities impinging upon the ends of her nerves and hypnotic suggestions, eitherself-induced or induced by an outside intelligence, say by her spiritbridegroom. And not only must she learn to distinguish thus between real andunreal sensations, but she must also learn to resist all hypnotic suggestion tofeel sensations which do not exist or which are unlawful. No psychic can beconsidered thoroughly self-controlled who has not acquired this power ofresistance to hypnotic suggestion of unlawful touches or of unreal things asreal. No psychic's testimony can be considered reliable so long as she fails todistinguish between genuine and illusory touches. So long as she is lacking inany of these essentials to the wife of a heavenly bridegroom, just so long willher guardian persist in putting her through a course of training—a trainingwhich she must undergo until she passes her examination and is promoted into ahigher class, there to take up still more advanced lessons in psychicdiscrimination and psychic self-control.Now, the \"Devil's Marks\" and the \"sucking\" were both, so I hold, illusorysensations which the witch failed either to classify or to conquer, but to whichshe mistakenly succumbed. When the supposed Devil's imp showed nonsensitivenessto pinpricks, it was probably a case of autosuggestion—or, in the case of some,a hypnotic dulling to pain caused (oftentimes in mercy) by the angel guardian.Of the same illusory character is that phenomenon which has so puzzled all thewriters on witchcraft—the icy chilliness of the sperm. This experience isentirely subjective; because it is forbidden by Borderland laws to evoke anervous energy for no definite result; and, as a harvest in offspring on theBorderland cannot be produced, it is breaking Borderland laws to sow the seed.The very fact that the Devil, who is supposed to be a deity of fire, [appears]cold in the Borderland marital union, ought to have shown his earthly partnerthat it was an illusion. And the psychic who expects or thinks to enact aforbidden experience on the Borderland, has only her own ignorance to thank forthe illusion.Incubi and succubae, evil spirits who were supposed to force themselves aslovers upon both men and women, played an important part in witchcraft days.Deformed children were supposed to have sprung of such a union. Luther believedimplicitly in this. Virtuous women seemed to be especially subject to theattacks of incubi, and this was looked on as attesting the cunning of Satan, whothus aimed at those noted for purity of life. It rarely, if ever, seems to haveoccurred to people in those days that a virtuous woman, reasonably clear-headed,is a being who is under especial angelic protection, and that when such a womanwas persistently singled out by a spirit for lover-like attentions, it must havebeen owing to the favor of Heaven, and not to the malignity of devils. Thatthese attentions became a great annoyance at last was only because the womaneither broke the moral law in some way, or became prejudiced against every suchbeing as an emissary of Satan. In time, by the workings of the laws ofBorderland, she who through natural curiosity and romantic sentiment at firsthearkened to the angel lover, and afterward through the failure to live arightor think clearly felt bound to reject him as a devil, became subject tohallucinations, and also in some cases to annoying physical manifestations. Somepicturesque stories have been told of such women to whom the spirit lover hasappeared in the guise of a handsome youth, vainly wooing his earthly love nightafter night. The stories usually wind up with an account of fearful persecutionsat the hands of the rejected lover, who thus by his malignity reveals himself asthe Devil. Sometimes the priest is appealed to, but not always successfully. TheRoman Catholic Church has a regular rite to exorcise demons, and is probablysuccessful with the psychic through hypnotic suggestion. But in the case of aspirit lover who has once been received (whether as husband or by [a]communicating spirit), it would seem as though his hypnotic suggestion oftenoutweighed that of the priest to still exorcise the fiend in cases of demoniacalpossession. But I am inclined to think that the very lingering of thesesubjective experiences indicates that her psychic hallucinations were often notonly due to hypnotic suggestions by her spirit lover, but were also theresult—recorded in her subliminal consciousness—of a veridical phenomena whichshe at first encourages; whether through harmless curiosity, or through theromantic and tender sentiment of a pure heart, or through the grosser impulsesarising from a luxuriant and untrained imagination, matters not. When her seasonof ordeals set in and she was obliged to distinguish between the illusory andthe real, in order to maintain communication with her interesting visitor, sheeither grew alarmed at the phenomena of the ordeals or else rashly assumed thewhole thing to be diabolical. From this time on, it were indeed strange if sheshould fail to see subjectively what she expected—i.e., the Devil. All in vainnow was it for her to exclaim in terror or indignation, \"I will have nothing todo with you!\" Her angelic lover had indeed ceased to communicate; but hersubconsciousness had not ceased to vibrate along the lines of psychicalillusion; and unless she possessed great self-control and had her subconsciousnature well in hand, time and time only could work a cure unless, indeed, sheshould implicitly submit her inner self to the priest or to some other earthlyhuman being as her hypnotizer, in which case it was a change from the hypnoticcontrol of a clear-seeing angel to that of a more or less blind fallible earthlyman, who may or may not take undue advantage of the power placed in his handsover her mainsprings of action. When one (1) considers that every woman whoenters a convent is pledged to a mystic union with a heavenly bridegroom,denominated Christ; (2) that the union, more often than the public is aware,becomes so objectively real that the confessor feels obliged to term it\"congressus cum daemonis \"; (3) that ignorance on the men's part of Borderlandlaws will render her experience fantastic or diabolical; (4) that herdeliverance from these experiences may be secured by a change in the hypnotizer,from an unseen angel to a visible earthly priest: We see what a power resideswith confessors to mold the minds of the nuns to carry out his hypnoticsuggestions for the glory of the Church. For the person who has been hypnotizedby spirits, and who has not acquired the power of resisting hypnotic suggestion,will more readily yield to an earthly hypnotizer. That the angelic lover shouldforce himself upon her as an incubus against her will is contrary to Borderlandlaws; for in the world beyond the Borderland (the world beyond the grave), it isreckoned a sin for a woman to have aught to do with husband or lover save forlove's sake; and hence the idea that women may be forced into a marital union onthe Borderland is totally incorrect, inasmuch as the highest standards of socialand ethical duty in both worlds must be lived up to by the two who meet upon theborders of the two worlds. Rationalists have tried to explain the spirit brideand spirit bridegroom as a nightmare arising from a plethoric condition of thebody, an explanation which has force only when the spirit is an incubus and nota succubus and when the earthly psychic (man or woman) is asleep or dozing. Butthe clearest and most convincing manifestations of the objectivity of theheavenly bridegroom always come when the psychic is most clearheaded. It seems,indeed, that it is not even in a trance but only when the psychic is wide awakethat the marital union takes place objectively. And this I think will be foundto be the case with the witches. When their union with the supposed Devil wasbased on the faithful tender love of one woman for one man, and its reciprocity,in accordance with high moral standards, then was the union objective andnatural. The gross rites of the Witches' Sabbaths, with their abnormalities andabsurdities, were evidently the illusion of an insane imagination in greatpart—although it is also doubtless true that, as Professor Wilder says, there islittle reason to doubt that these \"witches' sabbaths\" were formerly celebrated,and that they were, in some modified form, a continuation of the outlawedworship of the Roman Empire.Early in the 17th century, a light dawned upon the horizon of these illusionsand diableries. That light was the manifesto of a secret society of mysticscalled the Rosicrucians or followers of the Rosie Cross. In 1603 the sect becameknown; in 1623 it placarded Paris with mysterious announcements; but itprofessed to have existed long before. Who its members were, whether the societyreally existed, or whether the whole affair was a joke on the mystics, arequestions which today remain still unsettled. But, whether a reality or a myth,the Rosicrucians were a factor in the literature and mysticism of their time,and a secret society of the same name still exists. They dealt a powerful blowat the superstition which assumed the spirit bridegroom and the spirit bride tobe diabolical.> They discarded forever all the old tales of sorcery and witchcraft, and> communion with the devil. They said there were no such horrid, unnatural and> disgusting beings as the incubi and succubi, and the innumerable grotesque> imps that men had believed in for so many ages. Man was not surrounded with> enemies like these, but with myriads of beautiful and beneficent beings, all> anxious to do him service. The air was peopled with sylphs, the water with> undines or naiads, the bowels of the earth with gnomes, and the fire with> salamanders. All these beings were the friends of man, and desired nothing so> much as that men should purge themselves of all uncleanness, and thus be> enabled to see and converse with them. They possessed great power, and were> unrestrained by the barriers of space or the obstructions of matter. But man> was in one particular their superior. He had an immortal soul, and they had> not. They might, however, become sharers in man's immortality, if they could> inspire one of that race with the passion of love towards them. Hence it was> the constant endeavor of the female spirits to captivate the admiration of> men; and of the male gnomes, sylphs, salamanders, and undines, to be beloved> by a woman. The object of this passion, in returning their love, imparted a> portion of that celestial fire to the soul; and from that time forth the> beloved became equal to the lover, and both, when their allotted course was> run, entered together into the mansions of felicity.

Itpurports to be written by an acquaintance of one Count de Gabalis.158[index_split_019.html#filepos480406] Sub-Mundanes refers to stories told of theGothic Kings being born from a bear and a princess of Pegusians being born froma dog and a woman; of a Portuguese woman, who was exposed on a deserted island,having children by a large monkey. The author goes on to say that the sylphs ofthe Rosicrucians, seeing that they are taken for Demons when they appear, inorder to diminish aversion, take the form of these animals, and accommodatethemselves thus to the whimsical weakness of women, who would be horrified atthe sight of a handsome sylph, but less so at a dog or monkey. Sub-Mundanes tells a story of a hard-hearted Spanish beauty who repulsed aCastilian gentleman so effectually that he left her and set off to travel toforget her. A sylph fell in love with her, took the shape of her absent lover,wooed her persistently and won her. A son was born; and when she was againpregnant, the earthly lover returned to Seville, quite cured of his passion, andhastened to call on her saying he should now displease her no longer, as he hadceased to love her. Result: a scene, tears, reproaches on the part of the youngwoman—parents come in and the whole matter is brought to light. The writercontinues:> And what part played the Airy-Lover (interrupted I) all this while? I see well> enough (answered the Count) that you are displeased that he should forsake his> mistress, leaving her to the Rigor of the Parents and to the Fury of the> Inquisitors. But he had reason to complain of her: She was not devout enough;> for when these gentlemen immortalize themselves they work seriously, and live> very holily; that they lose not the Right which they came to acquire of> Sovereign good: So they would have the person to whom they are allied, live> with exemplary innocence.159 [index_split_019.html#filepos480795] Sub-Mundanes also tells of a young Lord of Bavaria who was not to be comfortedfor the death of his wife, whereupon a sylph took her shape. The same story astold elsewhere, however, stated that it was his own wife who returned frombeyond the grave. They lived together many years, and had children. But he\"swore, and spoke lewd uncivil words.\" She reproved him vainly, and at last \"shevanished one day from him, and left him nothing but her Clothes, and theRepentance of his not having followed her Holy Counsels.\"160[index_split_019.html#filepos481055] These two stories show what stress is laid by the spirit lover upon thenecessity for the earthly psychic to keep the moral law.Another story, unreal and fantastic as is the catastrophe, shows that bigamy isnot condoned on the Borderland, and that no man can serve two mistresses withoutpunishment when one of the earthly partners of one of these nymphs is hisBorderland spouse. It appears that he> was so dishonest a Man as to fall in Love with a Woman; but as he Dined with> his new Mistress and certain of his Friends, there was seen in the Air the> Loveliest Creature of the World; which was the invisible Lover, that had a> mind to let herself be seen by the Friends of her unfaithful Gallant; that> they might Judge how little reason he could have to prefer a Woman before her.> After which the enraged nymph struck him dead immediately.161> [index_split_019.html#filepos481315] But popular prejudice regarding the reality of witchcraft died hard. TheRosicrucians were charged with doing as did the witches—projecting their astralforms for selfish and lawless purposes. > It was believed by the populace, and by many others whose education should> have taught them better . . . that gentle maidens, who went to bed alone,> often awoke in the night and found men in bed with them, of shape more> beautiful than the Grecian Apollo, who immediately became invisible when an> alarm was raised.162 [index_split_019.html#filepos481609] But this seems rather unlikely, when we carefully consider the followingpronunciamento, with which they placarded Paris. > We, the deputies of the principal College of the brethren of the Rosie Cross,> have taken up our abode, visible and invisible, in this city, by the grace of> the Most High, towards whom are turned the hearts of the just. We show and> teach without any books or symbols whatever, and we speak all sorts of> languages in the countries where we deign to dwell, to draw mankind, our> fellows, from error and to save them from death.163> [index_split_019.html#filepos481913] Moreover, the Rosicrucians \"maintained most positively that the very first vowthey took was one of chastity, and that any of them violating that oath would bedeprived at once of all the advantages he possessed, and be subject to hunger,thirst, sorrow, disease and death like other men. Witchcraft and sorcery theyalso most warmly repudiated.\"164 [index_split_019.html#filepos482194] And the editor of Sub-Mundanes, in a footnote, refers to the Rosicrucianmarriage with the elementary or Spirit-life, esteemed a duty by the sages andcultivated with fasting, watching, prayer and contemplation and acquiringthereby that condition of spiritual repose, only in which inspired visionsoccurred.Why did these mystics call themselves Rosicrucian? Some writers have attemptedto derive the name from two words meaning \"dew\" and \"cross\": but the usualinterpretation is \"followers of the Rosy Cross\"—a cross with a rose being usedas the society's symbol. Some derive the word from the name, ChristianRosenkranz, the reputed founder of the society: but in view of the fact that itis uncertain that he ever lived, and that the stories told about the opening ofhis tomb 120 years after his death have a decidedly mythical flavor, one may bepardoned for considering this personage a myth, invented as a convenientexplanation to outsiders to throw them off the track of the real meaning of thesociety's name.Now, the cross is an old, old religious symbol of the union of man and woman theworld over, and dates from an unknown antiquity. The rose is a well-known symbolof love under its most ardent form. We have already seen that the MexicanVirgin, Sochiquetzal, was presented by a heavenly messenger with a rose when theannunciation was made that she should bear a mysteriously begotten son; that hername means the \"lifting up of roses\": and that this event marks the commencementof an epoch called \"the age of Roses.\" We have seen that the Mexican Eve sinnedby plucking roses—which elsewhere are called, apparently, \"the fruit of thetree.\" We have seen that quite on the other side of the world, among theMohammedans, is found a tradition that Christ was conceived by the smelling of arose, and there is an Eastern legend that the burning bush in which the angel ofthe Lord appeared to Moses—a bush which burned without being consumed—was a rosebush. May not these roses be symbolically one and the same with the rose uponthe Rosicrucian cross? If so, remembering the Rosicrucian teachings about theduty of chastity, the joy of nuptials with a being from the unseen world, andthe obligation to enter upon that heavenly marriage with \"fasting, watching,prayer, and contemplation\"—we may well believe that they had learned the innermystery of aspiring through passion to communion with God and of placing therose of Divine Love upon the cross of marriage union in Borderland wedlock.Although in a book entitled In the Pronaos of the Temple of Wisdom, by FranzHartmann, occurs a list of Rosicrucian symbols followed by the significantremark: \"He who can see the meaning of all these allegories has his eyesopen.\"165 [index_split_019.html#filepos482462]Many of these symbols are evidently phallic, and yield easily to theinterpretation that they are symbols in the training of the occultist in thethree degrees to which I have already referred.But, despite the good work done by the Rosicrucians in lifting Borderlandwedlock to a higher plane in the estimation of the public, it was not all plainsailing yet. The Church—that conservator alike of the useful and the uselessthings of the past—clung to the old belief of witchcraft days: When one of hermystics—either nun or priest—became thus espoused, the Church seems to have amiddle course between the old and the new. Usually she termed such experiences\"Congressus cum daemonis \" and bent her powers to exorcising the evil one. Butoccasionally, as in the case of St. Teresa, the nun was a clearheaded woman ofknown integrity and purity. \"congressus cum daemonis\" was out of the questionwhere such a woman was one of the parties to the union in these instances. Bywhat one can only call an inspiration from on high, the Church promptly decidedthat the congressus was diabolical, but heaven-sent. And, since the nun was theprofessed \"bride of Christ,\" what more natural than that her experience shouldbe viewed as a mystical union with this Divine Bridegroom? In this, the Churchacted according to her light, and I think it must be admitted she did fairlywell, considering the ignorance and prejudice of the times.Latin scholars will notice that the laws of Latin syntax require a word to besupplied in translating this phrase—a general term, such as the word\"something,\" or \"that which belongs to.\" As this grammatical construction wasused by a very learned Catholic priest when discussing the matter with me, Icannot suppose it to be a slip of the tongue, as I should have supposed had thespeaker been less of a scholar. This construction however, instead of obscuring,really sets forth the matter with clearer resemblance to the psychic's usefulphysiological experience, as will be seen by comparing it with the legends Ihave referred to regarding the finding of the body of Osiris by Isis. Only bycomparing this Latin expression with the legends and their application will thephrase be properly understood.It is noteworthy, however, that in St. Teresa's case, her confessor, afterhaving her write out a detailed account of her experience, ordered her to burn agreat part of it. Was it because the objectivity of her experiences did notharmonize very well with the mystical idea of \"espousal to Christ\"?Where the earthly partner in these unions was a woman, and a nun at that,pledged to unfaltering obedience to her official superiors, it was probably aneasy matter for her confessor to lump all her experiences—veridical as well asillusory—under one heading, that of subjective. A virgin is usually, by reasonof her environment as a woman, so ignorant of the physiology of marriage that itis difficult for her as a psychic to distinguish what is real from what isunreal until she has been a Borderland wife for some time. But for the priest towhom the blessed experience of Borderland wedlock came in all its fullness, adifferent course of treatment must have been necessary; since, being a man, withthe opportunities of knowledge open to a man, and to a priestly confessor ofsinful men and women, he could not be hoodwinked by his superior into taking forsubjective illusions these experiences which were distinctly objective. Therecords of witchcraft contain accounts extending over forty or fifty years ofpriests who were burned at the stake for a union of this sort, with a spiritassumed to be the Devil in the form of a woman.Pope Gregory is known as Hildebrand, that pope who strove so persistently topurge the priesthood of simony and unchastity, and to emancipate the Church frominterference by the temporal power. But what is done with priests nowadays whoenter upon Borderland wedlock is not, so far as I can learn, revealed to thegeneral public. From a French physician however, I learn of a custom among theContinental priests concerning their sleeping arrangements which suggest thatmore allowance is made nowadays than formerly for those who Heaven has thussingled out, and that the Church bows to the will of Heaven in this matter, andlays no blame upon the priest.Théophile Gautier has written a novelette called Clarimonde which recounts thelove of a beautiful vampire for a priest. She comes to him each night and theymount a horse and gallop away to her palace, then he returns at daybreak for hispriesthood duties. The author represents the priest as struggling between hisduties as a priest and what he considers the allurements of sin, and inconsonance with the idea that punishment is visited upon the sinner. Gautierreveals her as a vampire sucking the blood of her lover while he sleeps.It would seem as though the author, especially for a priest of God, werecatering to the popular superstition that it is sinful to enjoy sensuous love.But if anyone in the world is entitled to the joys of true Borderland wedlock,it is surely a priest who has kept his vows of asceticism, and who is reallypure-minded. If anyone in the world needs it, it is surely the priest who issupposed to stand midway as a bridge-builder, between earthly sinners andcelestial beings of the unseen world beyond the grave, since it is prettygenerally acknowledged that a well-ordered sex life is necessary to thedevelopment of a symmetrical character. For what mean the words \"holy\" and\"holiness\"? They mean \"wholely,\" \"wholeness.\" The man and woman who expect to beindeed \"holy,\" must be \"whole,\" i.e., symmetrical. In Old Testament times,Jehovah forbade any priest who was a eunuch to minister before Him, thusrecognizing the importance of sex in the perfect man. The Rev. Arthur Devine,Passionist, in a book entitled Convent Life, or the Duties of Sisters Dedicatedin Religion to the Service of God—a book which the title page shows is \"intendedchiefly for superiors and confessors,\" takes up the subject of nuns who aresubject to visions and supernatural revelations. Considering the question as towhether such experiences are true visions or the results of deception and error,he mentions as one test the consideration of> whether it {the revelation} contains anything false, because in this case it> cannot proceed from the spirit of truth. Therefore, it is necessary to> consider whether it is conformable to Scripture, to faith and morals, to> theology and to the doctrine and traditions of the church. . . . Are they> {these communications} accompanied by the cross and by mortification, and do> they tend to the manifestation of the faith and the utility of the Church?166> [index_split_019.html#filepos482797]> > From which it will be seen that a heavenly bridegroom who is not a good Catholichas every prospect of being classed as demoniacal, if he happens to have thesame religious belief as herself (she being heretical). This is a case wherereligious prejudice furnishes the standard by which to test the com- munication,and it will be remembered that to start with; for, any subject, when dealingwith occult phenomena, is certain to bring about occurrences of a fantasticmisleading or diabolical character. The spiritus percutiens, or \"rapping spirit\" conjured away by old Catholicformulae at the benediction of churches was brought forward by some of M. deGasparin's critics. As his tables did not rap, he had nothing to do with thespiritus percutiens who proves, however, that the church was acquainted withraps, and explained them by the spiritualistic hypothesis.A learned priest has kindly looked for the alleged spiritus percutiens indedicatory and other ecclesiastical formulae. He only finds it in benedictionsof bridal chambers, and thinks it refers to the slaying spirit in the Book ofTobit.167 [index_split_019.html#filepos483158]The \"slaying spirit\" in the Book of Tobit, it will be remembered, was aso-called evil spirit who was in love with Sara and who objected to hermarrying, and who slew seven successively earthly aspirants to her hand on theirbridal night. He is always referred to as an instance of the incubus. But let usnot forget that so-called incubi are angels, and are never evil; since in orderto hold communication with the beloved earthly person they, as well as thepsychic, are obliged to live correctly and think clearly. And what is evil onthe Borderland is all subjective and never objective. And the number seven too,in regards to the husbands of a virgin who already has a spouse, has asuspiciously mythical, folklorish look.That the Roman Catholic Church should take account of such a spirit in thebenedictions of bridal chambers shows that it has had good reason to suspect thevisits of incubi to the virgins of its laity, as well as to the virgins of itsnunneries. Indeed, Tylor in his Primitive Culture tells us that the frequency ofincubi and succubae \"is set forth in the Bull of Pope Innocent VIII in 1484, asan accepted accusation against many persons of both sexes, forgetful of theirown salvation, and falling away from the Catholic faith.\"168[index_split_019.html#filepos483461]The following, which I take from Sub-Mundanes, refers to one of the most notedinstances in convent life of an incubus who was objectively, as well assubjectively, the spouse of a nun.> A little Gnome got into the affections of the Famous Magdalen of the Cross,> Abbess of a Monastery at Cordova in Spain; she made him Happy, when she was> but twelve years old; and they continued their Amours Libres for the space of> thirty years; until an ignorant Director persuaded Magdalen that her lover was> a Fiend; and forced her to demand absolution of Pope Paul the Third. Yet it is> impossible that this could be a Demon; for all Europe knew, and Cassidorus> Reniris has made known to all Posterity, the great miracles which daily were> wrought in Favor of this Holy Woman; which certainly had never come to pass,> if her Amours Libres with the Gnome had fallen so Diabolick, as the Venerable> Director imagined.169 [index_split_019.html#filepos483730] Another account, however, informs us that the abbess was accused by her nuns ofmagic—a very convenient accusation in those days when a superior was at alltroublesome—and that she very cleverly anticipated them by going to the Pope toconfess all and throw herself on his mercy. Inasmuch as he granted herabsolution, one cannot help wondering if he did not read between the lines ofthis confession the occult truth and recognize her as a lawful Borderlandspouse. Most of the accounts state that Magdalen's lover was the Devil, whoappeared to her as a black man. Here we come upon the same root idea, doubtless,as that behind the black Madonnas, the black Krishna and the black Quetzalcoatlof Mexico, a symbolism due perhaps in part to the darkness of the unknown worldwhence they emerge, and in part to their folklore and occult aspect as deitiesof night-time and Borderland nuptials. \"I am black, but comely,\" says one of thelovers in that mystical and passionate Song of Solomon. I have already referred to the Song of Solomon as being interpreted by Christiancomment and said to be a poetical statement of the rapturous union betweenChrist and his Bride, the Church. A side light is thrown upon the interpretationby a note in Kitto's Illustrated Bible, 170 [index_split_019.html#filepos483990]which quotes Lane171 [index_split_019.html#filepos484298] as saying that theodes sung by Mohammedans at religious festivals were of a similar nature withthe Song of Solomon, generally alluding to the Prophet as the object of love andpraise. In the small collection of poems sung at Zikirs appears one ending withthese lines:> The phantom of thy form visited me in my slumber; I said:> > > > \"O phantom of slumber! who sent thee?\"> > > > He said: \"He sent me whom thou Knowest:> > > > He whose love occupies thee.\"> > > > The beloved of my heart visited me in the darkness of night.> > > > I stood to show him honor, until he sat down,> > > > I said, \"O thou my petition and all my desire!> > > > Hast thou come at midnight, and not feared the watchman?\"> > > > He said to me, \"I feared: but, however, love> > > > Had taken from me my soul and my breath.\"172> [index_split_019.html#filepos484617]> > Finding that songs of this description are exceedingly numerous, and almost theonly poems sung at Zikirs, [and] that they are composed for that purpose andintended only to have a spiritual sense (though certainly not understood in thatsense by the generality of the vulgar), I cannot entertain any doubt as to thedesign of Solomon's Song. This religious mysticism finds a modern echo in a little publication recentlyissued by the Adi Brahma Samaj of Calcutta, as the first step in a newpropaganda. It is entitled The Religion of Love. In its pages occur these words:> Though these terms, Father, Mother, Friend, Husband of the soul, are all> allegorical, they very aptly express our sweet relationship with God, and we> have every right to use them. Among these allegorical designations the Husband> of the Soul is the best.173 [index_split_019.html#filepos484905] Zanchius wrote the Excellent Traite du Mariage Spiritual Entre Jesus Christ etson Église,174 [index_split_019.html#filepos485238] in which he drew a closeparallel between earthly wedlock and the spiritual and divine marriage of Christwith the Church Universal. Among other things, he laid stress on that Scripturalsaying of earthly husband and wife, that the twain shall become one flesh; andhe said that, according to Scripture, it was neither God the Father nor God theSpirit who is Sponsor of his Church, but the Son, who was made of like naturewith ourselves—like in all things to us, but without sin. He added: > His soul does not pervade all space, because it went out of his body when he> died and consequently was not in all places, since going out of the body, it> did not remain therein, afterwards being returned to the body {and} never was> and never will be (any more than the body) in all places . . . .> > In this spiritual marriage, all the person of each faithful one—that is to> say, the body and the soul—is conjoined with all the person of Jesus Christ,> and is made one flesh and one person with him.175> [index_split_019.html#filepos485582] As to the method by which this combined fleshly and spiritual union of theChristian with Christ can take place, Zanchius seemed to think that theEucharist in which one partakes of the body and blood of Christ is the soleappointed means. Now the Eucharist, or the use of bread and wine in a sacred rite, was an oldPagan custom bound up with the idea of entering into blood brotherhood, of whichJesus made use to emphasize his own brotherhood with his disciples. The ceremonyof the Eucharist was found in Peru when Jesuits first landed. In fact, it is avery, very ancient rite existing in widely separated countries. The Christianwriter Arnobius rebukes in cutting terms the Pagan mock modesty which blushed atthe mere mention of \"bread and wine\"—a matter which indicates some folkloreconnection between the Eucharist and sex; and if so, then between the Eucharistand the ancient mysteries of Phallicism. Inasmuch as by far the greater part ofall that was pure and holy in Phallicism is bound up with Borderland wedlock, itis possible that the Eucharist may have esoterically a wider significance thaneither Arbnobius or Zanchius was aware.Modern believers in the union with Christ have taken a less mystical and morepractical view of it than did Zanchius. Mrs. M. Baxter of the well-knowninstitution for Divine Healing, Bethlehem, London, issued a little pamphlet onthat text of 1 Corinthians 6:13, \"The body . . . for the Lord, and the Lord forthe body.\" In it, she says:> One of the most successful devices of Satan has been his attempt to divorce> our bodies from our souls in their relation to God. \"Your soul is the Lord's> of course, but your body is your own. You must serve the Lord with your soul,> but enjoy yourself with your body.\" Such is his counsel to those whose> tendency is gross and carnal, such as easily become drunkards, fornicators, or> prostitutes, and form the large class of fallen men and fallen women in our> midst. To another class he comes and says, \"You are religious; but it is your> soul with which you can serve God; all you can do with your body is to punish> it, and destroy it by slow degrees.\" Many look upon this as religious heroism;> but it is as much a lie to the truth of God, as is the grosser misuse of the> body for lust or appetite. God comes with his glorious claim. \"The body is for> the Lord and the Lord for the body.\"176 [index_split_019.html#filepos485832] \"Under the Divine Touch,\" a pamphlet written by Chester E. Pond of Philadelphia,contains the following recorded experiences, which, mystical as they may beconsidered from one standpoint, are singularly suggestive of the earlierexperiences of the psychic who has entered on Borderland wedlock, but who hasnot yet learned to distinguish between subjective and objective touches—that is,between a touch which is material, tangible, real, and one that is only ahypnotic suggestion made by the Borderland spouse. > For the last eleven months my whole being has been open more or less to the> joys, delights and peculiar sensations of heaven.

I find now in wondrous reality in Hiswritten Word. The meaning, hitherto unknown, of different passages, stands outclear and distinct—and Living Word within me, throbbing and thrilling andpermeating my whole being with His glorious Presence, bears witness of thewritten truth . . . .One day, I read in the Word, being led to it, the assurance of the angelconcerning Mary. Perhaps that day—or very soon after—the Spirit brought to me,as I was preparing dinner, \"Fear not, that which is conceived within thee is ofthe Holy Spirit.\" Such a rapid and powerful witness to the word went through andthrough me, beginning at the organs of generation, going all through, that I wasin great weakness, physically. The tempter had been busy about this time,casting fear upon me lest the flesh were in the matter. Thus the Spirit gave himanswer—with the revelation came the thought, \"I am with child!\"—but so sure wasthe witness, that instead of being greatly alarmed—praise the Blessed One, agreat joy swelled up within me at the thought of such a possibility.A glorious victory, afterwards. He showed me that it meant that this precioustruth of the marriage relation between us was, \"that which was in me was of theHoly Ghost.\" Praise the Lord! He has made me willing to do—to bear—to sufferanything for Him. He is making me fearless and filling me with His own desirefor the spread of all His truth —though I feel more especially the desire to winsouls for Him. I am assured that this, His most glorious and satisfyingrevelation of Himself must be acknowledged as He shall call upon us to do so, orwe shall come into darkness indeed, and distress. Shall the chosen and honoredwife shame to confess her husband when He would woo others, through her, to thesame high place?When we enter into this union, He is, as never before, the Life within us, andhow shall we seek to suppress the Life that has entered in to displace our ownold self-life, and to manifest Himself in and through us, in whatever way Hewills. He must be permitted to speak through us—and as I constantly pray, tolove, through me. Oh! with us there must be no question but one, viz: \"What wiltThou, my Beloved?\"—and ready response, opening up to meet His blessed will. \"AsThou wilt\"—\"no longer I, but Christ.\" No more my will, in the slightestparticular, but the honorable will of my Beloved.Reading Madame Guyon in Spiritual Progress, Part II, on \"Union with God,\" I findthe experience into which I have entered . . . .We have, in these last days, by the . . . been realizing, as we did in theearlier days, the Presence and power of Him whom we love. God comes upon us aswe meet together from 6 to 7 o'clock in the morning, to wait in silence beforeHim—at the table, before and after meals; as we partake of the food He gives. Wemeet Him in our rooms, and bow down before Him. As I go about my work, ofttimes,His Presence so fills me—or I hear the sweet wooing of His Voice, until I amconstrained to step aside, where I may—to be alone with my Love, and fall at Hisfeet in adoring worship . . . .One asks, how is this Baptism obtained?

Thenagain, lest one should make of it too scriptural a truth, separating it entirelyfrom the physical, it should be plainly understood that the union is as thesexual intercourse of husband to wife.If we expect this when the sensation comes, we will not be alarmed, butwillingly and freely give those parts to our Divine Husband as the Bride wouldnaturally do.I have written very plainly, because, first, I know it is the way He would haveme write; and secondly, because I would seek to save from distress and fear,that would harass, if the whole truth is not understood, viz: If one looks forone kind of manifestation (spiritual), and finds physical and animal.> Let me hear from you both, when the Lord leads.> > > > Lovingly in Him.178 [index_split_019.html#filepos486493]> > The same friend who showed me the above letter also showed me letters from agentleman who is the editor of a religious newspaper, giving a similarexperience upon several occasions in his life but with more circumstance ofdetail. Nevertheless, he regarded it as entirely a union with Christ, theBridegroom of the Soul, and spoke of it reverently. Madame Guyon179 [index_split_019.html#filepos486810] has left us memoirs of herrapturous union with the Divine Bridegroom of the Soul, and verses concerningHis love and watchful tenderness which are rare specimens of pure and delicatesentiment. Yet, so little was Borderland wedlock understood by the learned ofthose days, that Bossuet made a coarse joke about her marriage with the ChildJesus; and another French bishop, says Arthur Little, wrote what might almost becalled an episcopal lampoon. One couplet will be enough:> Par l'epoux quelque foi une jeune mystique> > > > Entend un autre epoux que celni du Cantique.180> [index_split_019.html#filepos487255]> > From which it would seem as though the Roman Catholic Church admitted that theremight be objective realities in Borderland wedlock (so far at least, as appearson the surface) which eschew objective phenomena on the Borderland and tries tokeep her mystics entirely in the realm of subjectivity—a realm where illusionsarise through the ease with which it is confounded with objective planes andwhere a well-trained mind is needed to distinguish between that which issuggested or thought hypnotically and that which actually occurs. And yet, it isfor a Divine Bridegroom on the Borderland that the Church has long trained hernuns in the life of ascetics. For in various forms of austere self-denial,asceticism as well as total suppression of the sex-nature is an absolutepreliminary step to Borderland nuptials, though only for a time. The questionarises however: who is this Divine Spouse of the purified and ascetic nun? Is itChrist? Or is it an angelic lover? The Church says Christ when the union isuplifting and insists that the relation is entirely mystical and not at allobjective. I think, from the testimonies in which I have adduced from Churchwritings, an angelic bridegroom is not impossible. And it is quite conceivablethat, where a nun believes that Christ is the only Borderland Spouse, herprejudice may result in her lover's appearing to her as Christ, just as themediaeval witch who believed that her Borderland spouse could only be the Devilwas pretty sure to see him with horns and hoofs and to be whisked away(subjectively) to a Witch's Sabbath of diablerie. Madame Guyon, indeed, admits that \"the vision is never of God himself norscarcely ever of Jesus Christ, as those who have it picture it to themselves: itis an Angel of light, who, according to the power which is given to him by Godfor this purpose, causes the soul to see his representation, which he himselftakes.\"181 [index_split_019.html#filepos487565] (That is, the vision issubjective, probably a hypnotic suggestion induced by the angel.)The following stories of saintly Catholic women who became espoused to aBorderland bridegroom show that they were untrained in distinguishing subjectivefrom objective phenomena. No wonder then, if they should mistake an angel forChrist himself.> The following is from the Act of Canonization:> > \"St. Mary Magdalene, born of the illustrious house of the Pazzi at Florence .> . . burned with so great a heat of divine love, that she would at times> exclaim . . .

(ut pararium aut veredarium.)183> [index_split_019.html#filepos488257] Various miracles were said to have been wrought through St. Rose of Lima suchas, for instance, the materialization of bread and also of honey in her father'shouse in time of scarcity; also, in answer to prayer, the payment of a debt ofher father's by a stranger who appeared at the house, bringing the money wrappedup in a cloth. > \"These are the assistances which her divine Spouse promised to the parents of> Rose, that he would give her as a dowry, when he wooed her in the character of> a heavenly sculptor.\"184 [index_split_019.html#filepos488532] In this last, we seem to be getting back to these angelic bridegrooms spoken ofin ante-Nicene Christian literature, who materialized gold and other preciousarticles for beloved earthly spouses. But, it may be asked, are these unions with a heavenly spouse mere maritalunions with angels, and does God (or Christ, as His human manifestation) playthe part in them? By no means. God is a party to Borderland wedlock in itshighest aspect, whether that wedlock be an objective marriage union as inearthly wedlock, or subjective and mystical blending with a divine invisibleintelligence. Madame Guyon was right in saying that her love toward God andGod's love toward her was the blissful feature in Borderland experience. Thereare lower aspects of Borderland wedlock than that which includes union with God;which are subject more or less to illusions, fantastic or diabolical. Only whenthe earthly partner aspires to the Divine Soul of all things, does the supremebliss of union with the angelic mate transpire. At such times one is fain toapply such a conception as that of Mrs. Gillen,185[index_split_019.html#filepos488796] a London teacher of Divine Healing, whichis:> The Universe consists of three factors—a Thinker, outward Expression of His> thought, and the realm of Mentality which lies between that Thinker and His> Expression, and which is the means by which the Untreated shapes what it> thinks into Expression in physical, material forms. If we conceive this Great> Thinker (God) as the central nucleus of a great circle 186> [index_split_019.html#filepos489473] which embraces the Universe, his> Expression of thoughts, motives, feelings, will be on the rim of the large> circle, and the sphere of Mentality, where those thoughts are being molded> into shape previous to Expression, will be the zone lying between the nucleus,> or Central Thinker and the outer rim of His all-embracing circle. Each living> creature, as part of this great circle, is a sector of the circle—thus:> > > > Image [images/00009.jpg]> > > > Such a sector consists, as does the entire circle, likewise, of three> factors,—(1) that which thinks; (2) mentality, where thoughts are shaped; (3)> the body, the material life, where spirit finds expression as outward form.> Nos. 2 and 3—mentality and the bodily form—are but the instruments of the> spirit, the thinker within us. The thinker within us is part of the Great> Thinker at the center of the circle of the Universe.187> [index_split_019.html#filepos489986] So that, according to Mrs. Gillen, it is incorrect to say \"I have a spirit.\" Weshould say \"I am spirit\": i.e., \"I am part of God.\" When the zone of ourmentality is kept unclouded between our material, bodily form and that within us(up at the point of the sector) Image [images/00010.jpg]which thinks, we are, as will be seen, in unbroken communication with the GreatThinker, God, who is Himself all in all: for our thinking self is part of Him.The application of this conception, from Mrs. Gillen's point of view, is thatwhen that zone of mentality is unclouded by dislike or other antitheses of love,then disease and other mundane annoyances no longer exist for us; since, beingpart of God, and being one with Him at the heart of the Universe, we have Hispower to create outward circumstances. From my own point of view, this conception has a bearing on the third andhighest degree in the mysteries of Borderland wedlock. But before enlargingthis, it may be well to begin with the preliminary training necessary to renderone the Borderland wife or husband of an angel, and to set forth the threedegrees in order with such detail as may be allowable in a work like this, whichis intended for the general public. The reader's hope to profit by theseinstructions for personal development, inasmuch if one can persuade one'searthly partner to try, with one's self, to live the life which is obligatoryfor Borderland wedlock, brings the Kingdom of heaven into earthly relations.The preliminary training necessary may be summed up by the admonition: Live acorrect moral life, according to our own highest standard (a standard, by theway, which should never be fixed, but always moving onward to still greaterexcellence) and to strive to think clearly and to form accurate conceptions ofideas, to express conceptions of ideas, to express conceptions with exactness,and to follow Truth, wherever she leads, and whatever your previous convictionsupon any given subject. Especially you must have high and clean thoughts aboutsex, that you can think about it, read about it, talk about all the detailswithout agitation, without grossness of thought, and with as impersonal a stateof mind as if you were discussing the circulation of the blood. And you mustlearn to recognize the educational value of sex attraction in the evolution ofhumanity from savagery into civilization. Chiefest of all, learn that sex isholy before God and the angels. During this preliminary training, all sex unionmust be refrained from absolutely. The nervous energy which has hitherto beenevoked for expenditure in this direction must no longer be expended, but, bycontinual self-mastery, be returned to the system for its upbuilding. Gradually,as the neophyte who has habituated himself to a pure-minded and idealisticconception of sex becomes accustomed to thus maintaining self-poise, no matterwhat the temptation, there will spring up in him a joy in his own power whichwill amply repay him for all his struggles.This process may take months, or it may take years. The Hindus have a sayingthat he who seeks a Borderland spouse must have known no women for seven years.But whether the process be long or short, whether the partner be sought byBorderland or on the earthly plane, it must be perfected before the first degreecan be entered upon. For those who would like to have at hand some textbook tohelp in passing this preliminary training, I would recommend a little pamphletentitled Practical Methods to Insure Success. 188[index_split_019.html#filepos490231] It is written from such a standpoint thatit can be placed in the hands of young people, and it is suggestive rather thanexhaustive of the subject under consideration. But it has nothing to do withBorderland wedlock, and, so far as I can tell, it seems to make thistraining—which I call preliminary—almost the ultimatum. It also advocates,incidentally, one or two ideas such as astrology and the necessity foroccasional fasting, the truth of which, it seems to me, remain to be proven. Butapart from these things, it is so admirably written that it will furnish a safegroundwork for any neophyte to build up his ideal sex life upon, and therefore Iearnestly recommend its perusal. The first degree should not be entered upon, asI have said, until the neophyte is proficient in this preliminary training.The first degree embodies the teaching of what is known as Alpha-ism. Itsprinciple is: \"No sex union except for the distinct purpose of begetting achild.\" The bearings of this principle will be discussed in my forthcomingtreatise on \"Psychic Wedlock.\"189 [index_split_019.html#filepos491255] Sufficeit to say here that the staunch adherence to this principle has uplifted andbrightened the lives of many husbands and wives who had begun to find themarriage state a hell on earth. But it is a mistake to consider this the mostadvanced teaching regarding the marital relation. It is beautiful, helpful, andnecessary to acquire for those who would live the life of the truly wedded: butit is only the first of the three steps which lead husband and wife up to theideal relation. In The Christian Life, a journal edited and published by Rev. J.B. Caldwell, Chicago, the teaching of Alpha-ism will be found set forth clearlyand reverently.190 [index_split_019.html#filepos491513]Following this should come another pamphlet called Diana, written by Prof.Parkhurst, the astronomer.191 [index_split_019.html#filepos492380] This pamphletis unfortunately marred by being printed in the reform spelling, but one forgetsafter a page or two. It is a psycho-physiological essay, intended for husbandsand wives, written from a high standpoint, and in refined language. Diana willfurnish the initiate with a bridge between the first and second degrees, and itis one of the most important and helpful contributions to the sex question thathave ever been published.It is evident that this first degree is likely to prove a stumbling-block tothose who degrade this beautiful principle of Alpha-ism (a principle embodied inthe Scriptural command, \"Be fruitful and multiply\") into an excuse for sowingmore seed than is needed to produce the harvest. The man or woman who, whetherin Borderland or in earthly wedlock, thus persistently distorts the aboveScriptural command into a permission for something very different from what wasintended, will never get beyond the first degree of the marriage relation. Tocreate children is not only a high and holy joy to every right-thinking husbandand wife, it is a solemn duty imposed upon them by the laws of their own being.And the psychic who shirks this duty in Borderland wedlock, although maintainingmarital relations by the angelic spouse, will be misled by all sorts offantastic or diabolical illusions. Conversely, whoever wedded on the Borderlandto an angel holds fast the thought of the duty of the married to create (undersuitable conditions), will ere long be shown the truth—i.e., that between twopeople dwelling on entirely different planes of matter, while the maritalrelation is possible, lawful and beautiful, to beget a child is impossible untilthe earthly partner shall have crossed to the world beyond the grave.The principle of Alpha-ism must be mastered by those who aspire to the seconddegree, whether on the Borderland or the Earthly plane. The second and the thirddegrees have this principle for their cornerstone. In none of the three degreesis it allowable to sow the seed except for the distinct purpose of begetting achild who has been reverently and prudently planned for at just that time. Noris it ever allowable to waste the seed by throwing it away (and with it thepsychic energy). The second degree launches the initiate upon the perilous waterof sense-gratification. If his previous training has enabled him to build astaunch craft for the voyage, well and good; otherwise he may be swamped at thefirst wave, or, if he rides its crest, and the crests of succeeding waves, hemay rashly venture too near the fatal rapids and be engulfed. It is possiblethat was the error into which Josephus says the \"giants\" fell when they trustedin their own strength. The second degree was practiced in the Oneida Communityfor thirty years, and was obligatory upon all its male members. The result washighly satisfactory despite the society's unsavory practice of community ofwomen. They do not seem, however, to have seen the necessity for a similartraining of female members. The author of that popular novel, The Strike of aSex, has been preparing a book called Zugassent's Theory, which is intended todeal with this method from a popular standpoint.192[index_split_019.html#filepos492923] I have not seen the work (which I believeis now going through the press); but from what I know of the author's reputationand his efforts hitherto in the cause of social purity, I feel that the book islikely to be judiciously worded and to be an aid in mastering the second degree.I doubt, however, if it deals with the training of the feminine partner. But theprinciples underlying the training of the man may be studied out from such awork and applied by the woman. The author is George N. Miller, 59 Murray St.,N.Y.The second degree is the most difficult of the three degrees to acquirephysiologically speaking, inasmuch as it exacts supreme self-control at acrucial moment. Those who have never attempted this degree, when told of it, areapt to either declare it impossible, or to scorn it as undesirable. But thosewho have once mastered this degree would no more forego the power which is nowtheirs, than a freed prisoner would voluntarily return to his dungeon. This waylies the path of liberty and life, and joy, and they who have once trodden it inthe perfect fullness of magnetic union with a dearly-loved spouse will nevercare to stumble along the old paths. The Oneida Community, despite its socialmistake of promiscuity, has made the human race its everlasting debtor, in thatit has left a thirty-year scientific experiment on record detailing the methodsand attesting the value of this second degree.But let it never be forgotten that this second degree must be built upon thefirst degree, Alpha-ism. To make use of it as a means to increased sensuality isto degrade it, and to do so effectually bars the initiate from entrance uponthat third and highest degree, where all joys—physical, mental, emotional andspiritual—reach an intensity beside which the joys of the first and seconddegree pale as a candle-flame in the radiance of sunlight. Moreover, if thisdegree be thus degraded by the initiate, it is almost certain to bring nervousdiseases of a very distressing character in its train.On the third, and highest degree, no book has yet been written, so far as Iknow. The teaching seems to have been handed down orally or else by picturedsymbolism or mystic rite, understood only by the initiates of this degree. I amnow compiling notes for my work on \"Psychic Wedlock\" which I hope will take upthe projected three degrees in more detail than is possible in this treatise.For the present, I can only lay down a few general principles, and theseprinciples cannot be fully grasped by any except those who have mastered thefirst and second degrees.The Hindus have the theory that God can enjoy food, drink and in fact allsense-pleasures, but only through the offering of an earthly devotee. Therefore,the devout Hindu offers God a share in all his gratifications of appetite—thusliving out, indeed, the Christian Apostle's admonition of \"whether we eat ordrink, do all to the glory of God.\" Too often, it is true, this doctrine isperverted into an excuse for sensual excesses, the debauchee soothing hisconscience by an offering to the god whom he worships. Thus has this sacredinner mystery become degraded by the unworthy. But even the tried and staunchinitiate of the first and second degree, unless he holds grace as he enters uponthis third degree, unless he holds fast to the teaching: \"Aspire to thehighest.\" Only in reverent and earnest aspiration to the Divine, to the Sourceof all things, to the Eternal Energy of the Universe, may this third degree beentered upon, either in Borderland or earthly wedlock. The more intense theemotion, the more absolute the necessity for aspiring with all one's facultiesto union with the Divine. Every element of selfish desire must be eliminated;one must aspire at that time, because it is right and beautiful to bring one'sholiest and tenderest and most ecstatic emotions into the presence of the GreatThinker, in order that they may there be purged of all dross and be a worthyexpression of our own best self. That is the first half of this highest degree.The second half is entered upon when spontaneously—not from selfish desire—itdawns upon us that to offer God a share of our pleasure at the moment may givehim pleasure. When singleheartedly, and in all sincerity and benevolent feelingtoward God, we invite him to become the third partner in the marital union,then, indeed, do we understand what it is to love and to be loved. We enter thusinto a personal relation with God in which, Impersonal Force though He be, werealize vividly that we are one with Him, and with Him one with all theuniverse. For that in us which thinks—the apex of our particular sector of thecircle of the universe, is on the one hand, in unclouded relation with ourphysical self on the outer rim, and on the other hand, it is merged into theGreat Thinker, the Great Nucleus who is at the center of all creation. From thatmoment, we are able to say to this Pantheos, Great Thinker, to thisAll-Pervading Energy, \"My friend!\" (And inasmuch as God is love in the fullestpossible sense of that expression, the connubial bliss of Borderland lovers isincreased tenfold.) From that moment, we know what it is to truly love God. Thisdivine trinity in unity must be the final goal of Borderland wedlock, if suchwedlock is to be permanent.It is in this sense, I am inclined to think, that Mme. de Guyon, St. Teresa, andother mystical Spouses of Christ received the Divine Bridegroom. Subjectivelymingled with this rapturous union with Deity, no doubt, were the experiences ofunion with the angelic husband, of whose very existence as such they wereunaware, confounding him with the Impersonal Deity who was the third element intheir union. Then, too, we must remember that these women, intelligent as theywere, were untrained in the nice distinctions of subjective and objective,hallucinatory, veridical, automatic, telepathic, subconscious, etc., [states,as] evolved by the modern Society for Psychical Research and other recentinvestigators of the occult. Moreover, there are psychical experiences inBorderland wedlock which are subjective while they seem to the untrainedoccultist to be objective. Of such a nature (apparently) was the experience of aPhiladelphia lady, a Spiritualist, who told me of her spirit husband. She was awidow, and this spirit was a deceased lover from whom she had been separated inyouth by a misunderstanding. He returned from the world beyond the grave toexplain matters, and to reclaim his lost love, and finally proposed that sheshould consider herself to be his wife from that time on, assuring her that itwas so recorded in his land. Thereafter, on several occasions, she experienced(when she was by no means prepared) a series of galvanic shocks extendingupwards through her body. These were doubtless hypnotic suggestions to prepareand train her for experiences of a more objective character. The manifestations,however, were interfered with by the return of a chronic complaint of the liverwith which she had suffered at intervals for years.If it be asked how a misty, vaporous being, such as a ghost is popularlysupposed to be, can sustain an objective marital union on the Borderland, Ireply that the ghost is not mist-like in reality, but only appears so because heis in a new world of matter, with a more extended scale of vibrations per secondfor the various forces of sound, heat, light, and electricity than obtain uponour earthly plane. Beyond the last faint violet ray of the spectrum, science hasdemonstrated that there are rays of color to which we are blind, but which solowly a creature as the ant can perceive. Dogs can trace a scent of which wehave no perception. Many people are so color-blind as to be unable todistinguish a red from a green light—a fact brought out some years since verymarkedly in an examination for railway service in England. An astigmatic personis almost, if not quite, blind to a fine line running in some one direction.Recent experiments by Galton193 [index_split_019.html#filepos493355] have shownthat cats and birds are sensitive to a whistle which is inaudible to the humanear. If our inferiors in the animal kingdom reveal such marked superiority toourselves in sensitiveness to vibrations, is it unlikely that our former equaland our superior, the deceased human being who has passed out of earth life intoa wider realm, shall also acquire sensitiveness to a wider range of vibrations?The ghost probably senses all things on our plane, plus a great many more thingson his own. Our sensations are included in his, but his extend far on each sideof our own. Therefore we cannot perceive his form or hear his voice in all hismaterial relations, because he is in a world where forms, colors, sounds whichwe are physically incapable of perceiving—except in the exalted condition of theclairvoyant or clairaudient—are part and parcel of his daily life. When we seehim, we see only through the narrow range of our own limited scale ofvibrations: so that we see him but in part, and therefore mistily, or hear hisvoice but faintly, or perhaps not at all, as it may cover a range of vibrationsper second quite one side or the other of our own scale of sound vibrations. Forthis reason, he is often obliged to speak to the psychic by the interior voice—ahypnotic rendition, apparently, of his voice through the medium of hersubconsciousness. For this reason, because his voice is not audible, as a rule,to her physical ears, the psychic must learn to discriminate accurately betweenthis interior voice and the voiced imaginings of her own subconsciousness, whichwill utter themselves quite as audibly as does the interior voice if the psychichas not acquired the faculty of holding her subconsciousness well under control.With experience, however, the discrimination comes in time to be madeinerringly, as St. Teresa has stated.Through the interior voice, a Borderland mystic may be wooed and won as a wifeif she be clear-headed and keep the moral law with scrupulous care. She does notneed to be clairaudient to hear her lover's voice interiorly. Nor does she needto be clairvoyant, if she be willing to go it blind, so to say. She is then inthe condition, however, of a person who is totally blind; and who is almosttotally deaf. She needs to be on the alert quite as much as if she weredependent on an ear-trumpet, in order to make no mistake in catching the remarksmade by the interior voice. Nevertheless, even people who are blind and peoplewho are deaf may fall in love with someone on this earthly plane and marrydespite the defective means of communicating ideas. Fortunately there are othermeans of transmitting ideas than by the interior voice or by the eye or the ear.In this connection the following article by Paul Tyner194[index_split_019.html#filepos493664] on \"The Sixth Sense and How to Develop It\"offers a suggestive thought:> I have said that I regard psychometry as the key to the development, on> rational lines, of the sixth sense. Psychometry itself seems to be a> development on the psychic side of that physical sense, which is at once the> finest, the most subtle, the most comprehensive, and the most neglected of all> the five senses—the sense of touch. While distributed over the whole surface> of the body, through the nervous system, this sense is more delicate and> sensitive in some parts than in others. The marvelous possibilities of its> development in the hands are shown in the cases of expert silk buyers and of> coin handlers. The first are enabled, merely by touch, to distinguish> instantly the weight and fineness of a score of different pieces of cloth> hardly distinguishable to the eye. Girls employed in the mints, while counting> gold and silver coins at an astonishingly rapid speed, detect at once the> minutest difference of overweight or underweight in the coin passing through> their hands. The remarkable sensitiveness developed by the blind in the tips> of the fingers, under such scientific cultivation as that provided in the> Perkins Institute, of which Laura Bridgman in the past and Helen Keller in the> present are such conspicuous examples, is familiar to most readers.> > It may not be so generally known that recent post mortem examinations of the> bodies of the blind reveal the fact that in the nerves at the ends of the> fingers, well-defined cells of gray matter had formed, identical in substance> and in cell formation with the gray matter of the brain. What does this show?> If brain and nerves are practically identical, is it not plain that, instead> of being confined to the cavity of the skull, there is not any part of the> surface of the body that can be touched by a pin's point without pricking the> brain? It shows, moreover, I think, that all the sensations generally received> through the other physical organs of sense may be received through the touch> at the tips of the fingers. It proves that a man can think not alone in his> head, but all over his body, and especially in the great nerve centers like> the solar plexus, and the nerve ends, on the palms of the hands and the soles> of the feet. The coming man will assuredly perceive and think in every part,> from his head down to his feet. Need I suggest the importance of remembering,> in this connection, how much in our modern life is conveyed by the hand clasp,> or the deep delight that comes to lovers in caressing touches, when impelled> to pat the hands or cheek of the beloved one, or to stroke her hair? It is> through the emotional life that our sensitiveness is led from the physical to> the psychic plane of sensation.195 [index_split_019.html#filepos494394] It is through the nerves of touch that Borderland wedlock becomes objective. Thelover may remain forever invisible, as in the fairy stories, materializing onlyat night, and then only to the touch of those nerves most capable of sensing histangibility. But, ghost though he be, it was the testimony of Reginald Scot inhis Discoverie of Witchcraft that the Witch \"hath more pleasure that way, theysay, than with anie mortall man.\"196 [index_split_019.html#filepos494713] Theangelic bridegroom, as well as this earthly partner, must live a correct morallife and think clearly; and this means that he must exercise a tenderness, aconsiderate regard for his wife's comfort and happiness, and also a maritalself-control of which too many earthly men are ignorant. No wonder then, that onthe plane of sentiment, she should prefer this ghostly spouse to \"anie mortallman.\" And on the plane of physiological relations, I think I have already shownthat the husband who is an initiate in the third degree, who has trained hiswife therein, can assure her of connubial bliss which is perpetual. TheBorderland bridegroom has this advantage, too, over the earthly bridegroom;being able to read his partner's thoughts, he can adapt himself to her mostdelicate fluctuations of sentiment at a moment's warning, and so never fail tobe truly her companion. \"If one could prolong the happiness of love into marriage,\" wrote Rousseau, \"weshould have Paradise on earth.\"In my own case, Paradise—the Kingdom of Heaven—has come into my earth life, andit has come through my heavenly bridegroom."},{"pageContent":"POSTSCRIPT: FROM IDA'S DIARY197 [index_split_019.html#filepos495031] (1895)"},{"pageContent":"THURSDAY, JANUARY, 3RD, 1895. I have not been making entries lately, because (1) I have been going to bed toolate to get much of anything; (2) Iases seems to have been choosing to use whatpsychic strength I had to issue instructions regarding the work on HeavenlyBridegrooms—a work which I think I can truly say, is much, much more due to hisdirecting intellect than I should have ever dreamed possible for me as apsychic. The more I think about the way that \"Heavenly Bridegrooms\" has been puttogether, the more I am amazed. Certainly, I, by myself, should never have beenable to concoct it as it now stands. That is not saying, of course, that it isgoing to be a suitable work for the public, although I trust it may be. But thegreat wonder of it all to me is that an outside intelligence seems to be runningthe machine, so to speak, and I am little more than amanuensis for him, —or it,whatever one may call that intelligence. Of course, I am, I trust, a fairlyintelligent amanuensis, so that I have no hesitation about making correctionspromptly of the matter given to me, when such corrections seem to be needed. Butoftener it is the other way round, and Iases corrects my work. Many of thetheories and explanations which I have put into \"Heavenly Bridegrooms\" I never,to the best of my belief and knowledge, had thought until the command came fromhim to write so-and-so at just that point in the treatise. But, when they werewritten, they commended themselves to my reason and common sense, and so Iallowed them to stand, sometimes modifying them with a \"probably,\" or \"it seemslikely,\" and so on, so as not to commit myself as holding such and such viewsimplicitly. The quotations and authorities I have, of course, looked up myselfin the first place. But Iases has arranged these quotations in such order assuited him best, I acting, as I have said, as a secretary for him. Many, manyquotations which I had laid aside for this work, he emphatically rejected, asoverloading the treatise, or as being calculated to shock the public and bringme into danger of legal suppression by the obscenists. From first to last, hisgreat insistence has been that the book should be \"suited to the generalpublic,\" and that it must not contain anything upon which the obscenists couldlay a finger.In some cases this has been a great regret to me, as I have had to leave out oneor two important arguments—for instance, arguments which would have included thephrase, \"mental masturbation,\" a term which explains, I have reason to believe,much that goes under the name of \"spirit communications\" in these matters. Then,again, I begged, and begged, and begged that I might explain the exact Englishmeaning of the Roman Catholic phrase, \"congressus cum daemonis,\" but Iasesobjected every time, insisting that it was risky in this edition. You willobserve, by the way, that the phrase as I have here written it and also in thetreatise, is \"congressus cum daemonis\" whereas, in speaking with you, I havealways used daemonibus. I have changed the expression for the followingreason—which, as Iases has forbidden me to put it in the treatise, you may beinterested in seeing here. I have never seen this phrase in any of the bookswhich I have so far come across, and have heard it only once—from a Catholicpriest with whom I was discussing my experience, and who was trying to frightenme by telling me that my husband was a demon. As I didn't believe in demons, anddidn't believe that any evil-minded person who had passed to the world beyondthe grave had power to communicate, much less harm me, I simply laughed at whathe said. He afterwards said to a mutual acquaintance that I was—I forget theexact word he used, but it meant \"invincible, unbreakable.\" Well, he at firsttold me there was a great deal of literature written on the subject; myexperience was nothing, as similar experiences had been known for centuries inhis own church, and the whole thing was very evil; there had been enough writtenon the subject to fill the room where we then sat. At once I asked, eagerly,would he please tell me the names of some of the books, so that I could read upon the subject? This was more than he bargained for, and he at once changed histactics, and tried to make me think that I had misunderstood him in this lastremark; what he had meant to say was that all that had been said on the subjectcould easily be crowded into that room. And from that moment I could get nothingout of him save that my experience was by no means unique, and that it wasentirely evil, and the work of a demon. He several times used the phrase,\"congressus cum daemonis\" as the term applied by the Church to such unions.Afterwards I looked up the declension of the word \"daemon,\" as it seemed to methere must be something wrong, grammatically speaking, about that phrase. As cum(\"with\") governs the ablative, and his expression was daemonis, which is thegenitive, I concluded (rashly, as I am now convinced) that he had made a slip ofthe tongue, and that he must have forgotten his declensions, and have thoughtthat daemon, which is really a noun of the third declension, was a noun of thefirst declension, whose dative and ablative plurals end in is. And so I alwaysused it afterward, in speaking to you, as \"daemonibus.\" But when I came to writeit out in my treatise, I saw there was still something wrong about it, for thatwould make the phrase literally \"congress with demons\" whereas a psychic usuallyclaims congress only with one, and not with a plurality of spirits. But beforethis idea had struck me, I had set myself to work to look up every possibleexception to cum's government of the ablative. I found, in a note, thatsometimes the word which cum governs is omitted, and only the genitive dependenton the missing word appears. So that the phrase \"congressus cum daemonis \" wouldbe quite correct, provided some missing word were understood—a word of anindefinite meaning, such as \"that pertaining to,\" \"the things of,\" etc. Thiswould make \"congressus cum daemonis\" mean literally, \"congress with somethingbelonging to a demon.\"Do you see the exquisite nicety of that rendering? Evidently, the psychics towhom that term was applied, had experiences just like mine, insofar as the factthat only \"something belonging to\" the spirit—i.e., his phallus—materialized; sothat their \"congress\" was literally with \"something belonging to\" him. Comparethis with what I have told of the two legends relative to Isis finding thepieces of her husband's body, in one case, all except the phallus, and in theother, none of the pieces except the phallus, from which solitary member shereconstructs the deceased husband. I did put in the legend of Isis, and wantedawfully to put in this about the \"congressus cum daemonis,\" but Iases wouldn'tlet me. The priest who used this phrase was a very intelligent man, with quite apassion for book study, so that, you see, it really is very unlikely he shouldmake this grammatical slip—in this language of all languages, which is thevernacular of the Catholic priesthood.28 [index_split_013.html#filepos108716] Theodore Schroeder, \"The ReligiousErotism of Ida C.\" (SCRC, 1930), pp. 8–9. 29 [index_split_013.html#filepos110163] Richard Westbrook, The Eliminator:Skeleton Keys to Sacerdotal Secrets (Philadelphia: J.

Modern psychology, however, generally evaluates mentaldisorders according to the degree to which they cause distress or otherwiseinterfere with an individual's ability to function productively in society. Bythese standards, it would be difficult to condemn Ida's behavior aspathological. Her symptoms do not neatly fit any of the diagnostic criteria forconditions such as schizophrenia or personality disorders. It is important tonote that, although Ida eventually did submit to psychiatric observation for aperiod of three months at the Pennsylvania Hospital for the Insane, she wasnever legally judged insane, and the hospital had no grounds upon which tocommit her involuntarily.

This account was intended only for the man who had financed herduring her researches in the British Museum. (TS note) [From an unpublishedtypescript, originally intended to form part of an introduction to Schroeder'spublication of Heavenly Bridegrooms. The \"man who had financed her\" was W. T.Stead. This version has been corrected and conformed to Ida's original diaryentry.] "},{"pageContent":"> CHAPTER 3SEXUAL MYSTICISM In Heavenly Bridegrooms, Ida Craddock described a system of sexual mysticismhaving three degrees. The first degree, which she called \"Alpha-ism,\" requiredstrict sexual abstinence, the only permitted exception being for the purpose ofprocreation. The second degree, referred to as \"Diana,\" allowed for sexualintercourse, but without ejaculation on the part of the male. Only after masteryof the first two degrees could the third degree be attempted, which involvedinviting God to become a mystical third partner in a couple's lovemaking, thusproviding them with access to divine consciousness. These degrees weresuccinctly set forth and elaborated upon in an essay entitled \"Psychic Wedlock,\"which Ida began assembling during the writing of Heavenly Bridegrooms andcompleted the following year. Ida's system has some intriguing similarities with that of the most well-knownoccult organization to practice sexual mysticism, the Ordo Templi Orientis(\"Order of the Temple of the East\" or \"Order of Oriental Templars\"). Formallyestablished by high-ranking German Freemasons in 1906, the O.T.O. also had threedegrees of sexual mysteries, originally developed by Carl Kellner198[index_split_027.html#filepos575188] around 1895. The first degree of Kellner'ssystem called for sexual chastity as well. In spite of these similarities,however, it is unlikely that Kellner was directly influenced by Craddock, orvice-versa. Although completed in 1895, neither Heavenly Bridegrooms nor\"Psychic Wedlock\" were published during Ida's lifetime; they were circulatedonly directly by her to a very limited audience of close associates. TheO.T.O.'s teachings were also unpublished and made available only to initiatedmembers. Nonetheless, a later leader of the O.T.O., Aleister Crowley, creditedIda with having \"initiated knowledge of extraordinary depth\" and \"access tocertain most concealed sanctuaries.\" He even speculated that her revelation ofthose secrets contributed to her untimely demise.199[index_split_027.html#filepos575600] Apparently she had hit pretty close to themark.It has also been suggested that Craddock and Kellner were inspired by the samesource.200 [index_split_027.html#filepos575830] Kellner may have been a memberof the Hermetic Brotherhood of Light founded in Boston in 1895, whichincorporated the occult sexual teachings of Paschal Beverly Randolph dating fromthe 1870s. The influence of Randolph undoubtedly found its way into the O.T.O.'ssystem of sexual magic, and the O.T.O.'s 1906 Constitution explicitlyacknowledges its origins in the Hermetic Brotherhood of Light. In HeavenlyBridegrooms, Ida cites works by two individuals with known connections toRandolph: Robert Fryar, publisher of Sub-Mundanes (from which she quotes) andthe main purveyor of Randolph's works after his death; and Paul Tyner, editor ofthe Arena and follower of Randolph's successor, Freeman Dowd. She also madenotes from In the Pronaos of the Temple of Wisdom by Franz Hartmann,201[index_split_027.html#filepos576168] an associate of Kellner and one of thefounding members of the O.T.O. But she didn't cite Randolph directly until shewrote \"The Marriage Relation\" in 1900, quoting from The Ansairetic Mystery aboutthe need for men to pace themselves to allow their partner time to orgasm.202[index_split_027.html#filepos576464] By this time, the details of herthree-degree system of sexual mysticism had already been worked out in full.Furthermore, there are key differences between Ida's system of sexual mysticismand Randolph's and the O.T.O.'s teachings on sexual magic. In HeavenlyBridegrooms, Ida acknowledges the potential of her third degree to be used formagical purposes, noting that \"an earnest wish breathed at that time . . . willnot fail to be granted.\" She dismisses this, however, as a mere side effect ofthe operator's requisite self-control and harmony with the universe; or, in theabsence of these, as \"black magic\" destined to fail.203[index_split_027.html#filepos576909] For Ida, the ultimate aim of sexual masteryis the mystical experience of union with the divine. This is in fundamentalcontrast to Randolph's teachings, which emphasize the attainment of magicalpowers through the sexual act.204 [index_split_027.html#filepos577322]Furthermore, Randolph insisted that \"it is absolutely essential that the neck ofthe uterus be bathed in and by the husband's prostatic lymph and ejected semenevery time they know each other,\"205 [index_split_027.html#filepos577622]exactly the opposite of Ida's injunction against male ejaculation.So although Randolph's works were certainly known to Ida, at least by 1900, theyprobably didn't play a significant role in the original formulation of herteachings. If that is the case, then where did they come from? We canconfidently answer this question through careful examination of the evidencefound in Heavenly Bridegrooms and in her diaries at the time of its writing. Thename of Ida's first degree, \"Alpha-ism,\" provides the first clue. The term isundoubtedly derived from E. B. Foote's 1882 book, Dr. Foote's Replies to theAlphites. Foote, whom Ida knew well through their Freethought connections,coined the term \"Alphites\" to refer to members of the Social Purity movement,which promoted the idea that sex should be undertaken only for the purpose ofprocreation. A prominent spokesperson of this group was Dr. Caroline Winslow,206[index_split_027.html#filepos577875] who published a journal called The Alpha;thus the term \"Alphites\" denoted her followers. The debate raged on through the1880s between Winslow and Foote, both medical doctors who advocated theirpositions from the standpoint of public health. Although politically andpersonally Ida would have been more sympathetic to Foote, she nonethelessrecognized the value of the Alphite doctrine within the scope of her firstdegree, and cited another advocate of Social Purity, Rev. J. B. Caldwell, in thetext of Heavenly Bridegrooms.Ida's second degree, however, was a distinct departure from Alphaism, because itspecifically inculcated sex for non-procreative purposes. Ida called this degree\"Diana,\" after a work she cited in Heavenly Bridegrooms entitled Diana: APsycho-fyziological Essay on Sexual Relations for Married Men and Women. Thiscurious pamphlet was written by a professor of astronomy, Henry Parkhurst, whohad previously been a court stenographer.207[index_split_027.html#filepos578202] The practice of Diana (named for the Romangoddess of chastity) was essentially Noyes' Male Continence, sexual intercoursewithout ejaculation. Parkhurst believed that this was a refinement of theAlphite doctrine, which made it practicable for ordinary men and women who wouldotherwise not have the discipline to carry it out. From Heavenly Bridegrooms,then, we can identify the sources of Ida's second-degree teachings as Parkhurst,Noyes, and George N. Miller (Zagussent's Discovery). In \"Psychic Wedlock,\" Idaalso introduces Alice B. Stockham's Karezza,208[index_split_027.html#filepos578696] which differs from the others in that itadvocates continence on the part of the female as well, requiring both partnersto refrain from orgasm. This recapitulated her own view, set forth in \"The Dansedu Ventre,\" that the woman's self-control during coitus was just as important asthe man's.In \"Psychic Wedlock,\" however, Ida introduces a second level to the seconddegree. At this level of mastery, the male obtains the ability to experienceorgasm fully, but without ejaculation.209 [index_split_027.html#filepos579208]She notes that \"this is a step beyond the teaching of even the Oneida Community,and I cannot refer the reader to any books upon the subject. But there are todaymen who have acquired even this power.\" This statement suggests that Idaacquired knowledge of this ability personally rather than through her libraryresearch, most likely from Westbrook.210 [index_split_027.html#filepos579610]She also describes a similar process for women, in which orgasm is repeatedlyapproached but not fully indulged until the partners are able to climaxtogether, \"in selfcontrol and aspiration to the highest.\"For the third degree of her, Ida provides no citations. In Heavenly Bridegrooms,she states that no book has been written about it, but its lessons have beenpassed down only through verbal, symbolic, or ritual means. Turning to her diaryfor the period, we find that, indeed, this was the case with Ida. In her entryfor October 1st, 1894, she wrote:> Mr. Harte called to see me yesterday, and we walked in Kensington Gardens, and> had a long and interesting talk. One thing on which he laid emphasis was the> Hindu idea that a god can enjoy only through a mortal, and that mortals ought> to share their delights with the gods, or with God; and that the difference> between the pious and the impious man was that the impious man forgets God,> while the pious man remembers Him, and offers him a share of all his earthly> enjoyments. Last night was the appointed time for union with Soph, and, as the> union progressed, and the usual time came for praying to be united with God, I> fell to thinking of Mr. Harte's remarks, and I thought how beautiful his idea> was. I at once longed to give God the pleasure which my husband and I were> having. I would here remark that I was playing Venus to his Adonis,211> [index_split_027.html#filepos579999] and that I knew it would probably be the> last night before tapu time; and I felt, doubtless for that reason, more> passionate than usual. At all events, I tried my best to be passionate and> voluptuous and self-controlled, and at the same time to offer my enjoyment—I> should say, our enjoyment—to God, as the all-pervading Spirit, the final Force> with which all forces, material and spiritual, correlate; and I offered it,> not as a mere scientific experiment, but out of love for God. I think I was> never so near to feeling what it is to love God. And all the while, too, I was> loving my husband, and striving to give him some of my magnetism, so that he> could pursue his studies successfully with more ease, and also I was rejoicing> with my husband over his promotion, and longing to make our union a sort of> festivity for that occasion. In short, I felt many, many things at the same> time; and the more I longed to give to God, the more I had to give. I cannot> describe the deliciousness of the physical union, the passion, the voluptuous> delight, far beyond any religious delight I ever had, of offering to God> something that He really cared for. Oh, if sensualists did but understand the> joy of self-control, of aspiration to God in the very midst of one's ecstasy,> and still more, the joy of sharing one's delight with God—well, they would> turn with loathing from their present methods of performing the \"act of kind\"!> I am so glad, so glad, to have had this experience, even if I never manage to> again on earth. It is the only right way, I know, I know, I know it. In her October 27 entry, she also noted: > Of late, since I have learned actually what it means to share our joy with God> thus, there are times when I feel that God, the All-Pervading Force, is my> personal friend. Not, by any means, as a human incarnation; it is as a Force.> And I feel as though I had a sort of claim upon him for help at trying times,> and for protection in my gospel work. I feel that I can turn to him, as to an> earthly friend, and say, at some special moment, \"Do please help me.\" I think> it is most wonderful and beautiful—this realization of the actuality of God at> once as the One Sustaining Energy of the universe, and yet as my personal> helper and friend, with whom I can interchange loving offices, giving pleasure> to Him as well as receiving it from Him.> > And all this has come about from that first Sunday morning chat with Mr.> Harte. So who was this very helpful Mr. Harte, who orally transmitted the doctrine ofthe third degree to Ida? Undoubtedly it was Richard Harte (1855– 1925), anAmerican journalist living in London at the time, who was a long-time personalfriend of Colonel Henry Steel Olcott (1832–1907), cofounder of the TheosophicalSociety. Harte had joined the Society early, within a few years of its foundingin New York in 1875. He served as acting editor of The Theosophist journal for atime, and traveled to India in 1888 to represent the American section at theSociety's headquarters in Adyar. But he eventually had a falling-out with MadameBlavatsky and, by 1893, was no longer active in the Theosophical Society. Heremained in London, however, and was probably introduced to Ida by her patron,W. T. Stead. Thus, all the pieces were in place for the writing of \"Psychic Wedlock.\" Ida'steacher of Divine Science in London, Alma Gillen, provided the philosophy of\"expression\" and the terminology of the \"Great Thinker\" set forth in chapter 2[index_split_013.html#filepos106326]. Albert Chavannes212[index_split_027.html#filepos580275] was Ida's source for the concept of \"sexualmagnetism\" exchanged by the partners in coitus as the true measure ofsatisfaction. Alpha-ism and Diana provided the basis for the first and seconddegrees treated in chapters 3 and 4 [index_split_028.html#filepos582309], andRichard Harte inspired the idea, confirmed by Ida's own experience, of the thirddegree's \"communion with deity\" as described in chapter 5[index_split_032.html#filepos710215]. This work represents Ida's full synthesisof a complete system of sexual initiation into the gnosis of divine bliss.I have also included in this chapter a short piece by Ida that TheodoreSchroeder extracted from her magnum opus, \"The Marriage Relation,\" written in1900. Schroeder titled it \"Spiritual Joys\" and submitted it pseudonymously tothe occult journal Azoth in 1918 under the name \"Cadi\" (\"Ida C.\" backward). Ihave restored two additional paragraphs from the original and included them herefor the first time in print.Image [images/00012.jpg]> Figure 5.

In theperfect union, the amount of energy expended on any one plane is in exactequation with that expended on either of the others. But when the reverseoccurs, the union is imperfect; and when the inequality is marked, the union hasno claim to be called true wedlock. Thus, when the energy expended upon bodily union is greatly in excess of thatexpended upon the mental and spiritual planes, it is called lust, andright-thinking people turn from it with a shudder.When intellectual and artistic tastes are the chief basis of union between manand woman, we have a partnership in which mentality is in excess. Such unionsare mutually helpful and bettering, for the two are then intellectual orartistic comrades. But if, as is too often the case, the body be ignored ordespised, it is not wedlock, but Platonic friendship which really unites thetwo.Union upon the plane of spirit in excess of either body or mentality is perhapsvery rare. Like mental union per se, it has its peculiar raptures; but no moodof spiritual ecstasy can be permanently helpful if it fail to translate itsraptures into an expression of energy upon the mental and bodily planes.It is to suggest the duties and the joys of union in an exact equation upon allthree planes that this little essay on Psychic Wedlock has been written.Image [images/00013.jpg]There is a great deal of misapprehension today, among intelligent and refinedpeople, regarding the relation which should exist between husband and wife. Sexunion upon the bodily plane is too often deprecated as a concession to adegrading appetite; those who thus deprecate it, tacitly follow in the footstepsof St. Paul, who advised marriage as an outlet for uncontrollable passion,saying, \"It is better to marry than to burn.\" The early Christian fathers almostuniversally chorused this idea, insisting that perpetual virginity in man andwoman is the state which those should seek who wish to live the ideal life.Marriage was looked on as impure; and this idea crops up in the Church and amongthe laity for several centuries, and is bearing fruit today in our social andreligious customs. Christianity, so far as the writer is aware, is the onlyreligion in the whole world which fails to give some teaching to its youngpeople concerning their sex capacities and duties, so as to prepare them for thesacredness of the marital union. From whom, let us ask, do the prospectivefathers of the race acquire their knowledge of sex powers? Usually fromprostitutes, from gross-minded schoolboys, or from depraved men of the world.From whom do the prospective mothers of the race acquire their knowledge?Perhaps, at most, from French novels, or in the unhealthy atmosphere of girls'boarding schools, or from married women scarcely less ignorant than themselves.But usually their knowledge is acquired from the aforesaid prospective fathers,upon the wedding night. Can we wonder that the offspring from such parents tendmore and more, as successive generations are born, to differentiate into twowidely opposing types—on the one hand, the ascetic and the prude, who loathe thebody as impure in all its sex relations, and on the other hand, thecarnal-minded man or woman, whose thoughts about marital union relate chiefly tothe body? It is the prudish silence of the Church and of those whom she influences, whichwe in Christian lands have largely to thank for the marital unhappiness in ourmidst.In savage tribes today, however ignorant, and in the old days of Paganism at itsbest—before Paganism had sunk into refined sensuality—we find a very differentstate of affairs. We find the dignity and holiness of the sex relation upheld bysymbol and rite, by mythic tales and sacred dances. We find the medicine-man orpriest instructing young men and maidens in the marital duties which they areabout to assume—crudely, indeed, but with a mingled frankness and reverence forsex mysteries which we today should be a purerminded people for imitating.The ancient medicine-man has disappeared in civilized lands, having split upinto three beings—the priest, the physician and the schoolteacher. But the oldwisdom still survives in out-of-the-way places, and can be restored by thelearned. And our wise men possess what the ancient Pagans and the modern savagesdid not and do not—a detailed knowledge of embryology, of many laws of sexphysiology, and of certain aspects of psychology. Why should not the modernheirs of the old medicine-man—the priest, the physician and theschoolteacher—resume the position which is naturally theirs, of instructors ofthe young in that which all need to know who are likely to enter the maritalrelation?The times are ripe for such a movement. People on all sides are eagerly seekingknowledge which shall lead them up, and not down, in sex matters. Will theChurch, the medical fraternity and our academies of learning continue to neglecttheir duty?Let us hope that all three will erelong awake to the vital necessity for someorganized and systematic teaching to the people upon sex—teaching which shalltreat frankly of those physiological matters which are expunged from ourschool-books; teaching which shall set forth in its true light the hygienicvalue of sex union for every normally constituted man and woman; which shallshow the moral obliquity of those who, whether legally married or not, createchildren by accident, and not by intention; which shall insist upon thesacredness of the wife's person; which shall uphold the duty of union inself-control and aspiration to the highest, and which shall not blush to franklyadd that such self-control and aspiration will result in increased pleasure toboth husband and wife. Last, but not least, let us have teaching which shows howthe path to that ideal life which we all of us hope and mean to live, liesthrough the senses to the Highest whom we variously term God, the Unknowable,the Ideal, Unconscious Energy, Law, Force, etc.Meanwhile, however, since our natural teachers, the physician, the priest andthe schoolteacher, remain silent on this vital question, we of the laity must dowhat we can to enlighten each other. And the present essay on Psychic Wedlock isan attempt to do this, in a small way. Such truth as I have discovered, I desireto share with my fellow-beings, hoping that they will add thereto, and pass ourjoint knowledge along to others.Image [images/00013.jpg]It will be observed that this essay treats of three degrees of initiation intopsychic wedlock. These three degrees seem to be bound up with the innermysteries of pagan religions everywhere; but the second and third degrees inespecial appear to have been jealously hidden from the people, and to have beenimparted only to those who had passed certain ordeals, and had thereby provedthemselves worthy. These things were also bound up with Borderland occultismunder certain aspects. In ancient times, the people had not the public school;they were more ignorant of the natural sciences than is the merest schoolboy oftoday; so that there was a good reason then for keeping advanced sex mysteriescarefully hidden from the masses. Moreover, the science of psychology (which wemay here use as a convenient term to include all effects of mind upon mind) wasthen in its infancy. What Dr. Carl du Prel213[index_split_027.html#filepos580785] terms \"the displacement of thepsycho-physical threshold of sensibility\" through dreams, hypnotism, drugs,insanity, anger, strong emotion, etc., was in those days studied and understoodonly by the learned few, mainly the priests. The latter produced the \"templesleep\" (nowadays known as the hypnotic sleep) in which the inner sensibilitiesof the hypnotized subject, exalted to an unusual degree, brought aboutremarkable results in prophecy, medical prescriptions, clairvoyance, telepathy,etc. Today, however, the science of hypnotism is exploited in medical and layjournals, so that any non-professional reader may inform himself of its wondersin detail; and the Society for Psychical Research has carefully collatedhundreds of well-attested cases of thought-transference which indicate that thefaculty of telepathy is a common property of humanity. But even today, the realm of psychology contains vast unexplored tracts.One of these as yet unexplored tracts is the psychic effect of mind upon mindduring the marital union. People who would shrink from drugging themselves withliquor or opium, and who hold that yielding to so-called \"spirit mediumship\" isdangerous, will, nevertheless, recklessly abandon their self-control during thesex ecstasy. It is well established that a child conceived when the father isdrunk will be mentally unbalanced, usually to the borders of idiocy. Ifintoxication—i.e., lack of self-control—at the moment of conception be producedby other means than by alcohol, is it likely that the resulting offspring willnot be tainted thereby?Now, the keepers of the ancient mysteries probably did not know what we inmodern days know about physiology, embryology, and similar ologies. But theyseem to have learned sufficient to realize the importance of never displacingthe psycho-physiological threshold of sensibility during the sex union, exceptin a state of absolute self-control. And the acquirement of this self-controlappears to have constituted the second degree in initiation. But because it putsthe begetting or non-begetting of children entirely within the power of theparents, and because it intensifies the delight of wedlock, they probably fearedthat it would be a dangerous knowledge to place within reach of any but a worthyinitiate. Hence it was and still is jealously guarded from the general public.But inasmuch as we of the nineteenth century live in an era of almost universaleducation, it would seem as though the time had come when this second degree,and also the third and final degree, may be more widely imparted.The following are the three degrees treated of in this essay: 1st. Sex union forbidden, except for the distinct purpose of creating a child atthat particular time. 2nd. Sex union enjoined in absolute self-control andaspiration to the highest. 3rd. Communion with Deity as the third partner in themarital union. To those who wish to train themselves in these three degrees, I would say:self-control is the keynote. And in order that self-control may be acquired withas few setbacks as possible, I strongly urge that all liquor, tea, coffee,tobacco, opium or other narcotics be dispensed with from the first moment ofentrance upon the training until the final acquisition of initiateship in thethird degree. These things, one and all, displace the psycho-physical thresholdof sensibility, each after its own fashion; so, also, does the emotion evokedduring the sex ecstasy; and it seems foolish to wantonly increase the ordealthrough which one must pass in acquiring the marital self-control of the seconddegree.Another point which is of the highest importance in the preliminary training ofthe would-be initiate is, that he or she shall learn to look upon the human formdivine with emotions which never degrade, but which always seek to idealizetheir object. Whatever the neophyte's opinion as to the wisdom or unwisdom ofthe nude in art, he must acquire the habit of viewing the human form, whereverand however he lights upon it, with chaste emotions, and without agitation.Until he can do this, he is not worthy to enter upon even the first degree.He must also acquire the ability—if he does not already possess it—of hearingsex physiology discussed without undue agitation, and of discussing it himselfupon a high plane. In short, he should strive to become master of his emotions,as a necessary preparation for entrance upon the first degree.But asceticism should never be an ultimate aim. It is useful only as furnishinga gateway to higher, purer, more refined and more spiritual, as well as moreenduring, sense-pleasures.If we would conquer a fractious horse, do we do so by felling him to the earth?By no means. We control him by the bridle, and by gentleness; or again, we applywhip or spur, being careful to hold a tight rein; and at last we can guide himat our will. To kill him or even to stun him is not to truly master him. And tocrush the sex nature out of existence is not to truly master it, either. We canbring our sex powers under our control only by applying similar methods to thosewhich we should adopt with a high-spirited, full-blooded horse. Sex desire isnothing to be ashamed of; it is something to rejoice in, provided it be governedas absolutely as we govern an impetuous horse, allowing it to do nothing butwhat our higher self wills it to do.And oh, the joy, the joy of self-control! Only they who have thus conquered canunderstand!"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 2: THE INDIVIDUAL AND THE UNIVERSE To appreciate the highest aspect of psychical wedlock, and therefore of theinferior degrees which have the third degree as their goal, it is necessary toframe some philosophical conception of the relations existing between theindividual and the universe. This conception should be one upon which Christianand non-Christian, Atheist and Theist can agree. To seek to measure the infinite by the finite is, of course, absurd; but todeduce from the finite some of the laws of the infinite—i.e., from the known, apartial knowledge of the laws of the unknown of which that known forms a part—isboth logical and satisfying.The following conception will, I think, be found to have at least the merit ofsimplicity:Sexual Mysticism 155 Every act of the individual is an expression (somethingpressed out) from the inner to the outer. The process consists of three stages.Let us say that a man > (1) Conceives the idea of pushing a ball out of his path. > (2) He determines how the ball shall be pushed aside, with hand or foot,> gently or powerfully, etc. > (3) At the command of his mentality, his body performs the act of moving the> ball. To produce the desired result, then, two factors concur: First. The conception of moving the ball from his path. Second. A definitethinking out of the method, and a transmission of the order to the body. If the second stage be gone through with clearly within the man's mentality, theresult in the third and final stage of the process will be an exact expressionof his original conception, \"I will push that ball out of my path.\" But if hismethod of pushing the ball aside be not planned out properly, so that his mindfails to exercise full control of the bodily muscles, he will find the inertiaof the ball successfully oppose him, and he may stub his toe, or let the balldrop on his pet corn before he accomplishes his intention. Clear-headedness, therefore, is of the greatest possible importance. Ourmentality must be kept clear and unclouded, if what we may term \"the thinker\"within us is to have its orders correctly transmitted to our bodily selves. Wemay view the mentality which intervenes between the thinker within and the bodywithout as an atmosphere through which rays of light stream from the inward selfto the outer body. When the atmosphere is clear and colorless, the rays reachtheir destination unaltered. When it is colored by prejudice or clouded byignorance or dislike of anything or anybody, they likewise become colored, orthey are distorted, refracted, or almost entirely swallowed up in the mist, sothat the few glimmerings which reach our intellect (that side of mentality whichblends with the body) can but mislead. Were our inward conceptions conveyed toour intellects through an atmosphere of absolutely unclouded, unprejudiced andloving mentality, our outward lives would be godlike, for the thinker withineach of us is godlike, and in truth desires to realize only the highest ideal.What if we imagine all humanity as laid side by side to match, so as to form onecontinuous body, one continuous mentality, one continuous inward self? We mightrepresent this blending of humanity as taking place in a circle, thus:Image [images/00014.jpg]In this imaginary representation of humanity, each human being is a sector ofthe circle, and at the apexes of the sectors, where each of us is the godlikethinker, the blending must of necessity be perfect, however imperfect theblending and sharply defined the sectors may be on the mental and bodily planes.At the center of this imaginary circle, where our godlike selves join those ofour fellow-creatures, we are blended into one godlike spirit which is really thedirecting spirit of humanity—its Great \"Thinker,\" so to say. If in this circlewe include each living creature, whether plant or animal, we blend upon the\"Thinker\" plane with the egos or inward selves of all animate nature. And, whatwith the recent theories of \"fatigue in metals,\" \"chemical affinities of atoms\"and \"sex in minerals,\" it would perhaps not be unwarranted to include inanimatenature in our representation of the circle and sectors. If the members of themineral kingdom have no life (as we understand life), at all events, they arethe result of law, and appear to be the expression of that law, so that it wouldseem as though they also should be included as sectors in our circle. This circle, it will be seen, images the universe, not as a kingdom, with theDeity as a king who distributes his favors with the partiality and favoritism ofan Oriental monarch; but as a republic, in which each sector, however tiny, hasa vote in the General Council which directs the entire universe. In Scripture,indeed, we are told that God not only made man in His own image, but also thathe breathed his breath into man in order to make man a living soul. In Scripturewe are also told that we are heirs of God and joint-heirs with Christ; and Jesushimself, in the Sermon on the Mount, exhorts us to be perfect, even as ourHeavenly Father is perfect. So that, from a Christian as well as from aphilosophical standpoint, we may consider ourselves as like unto God, and onewith Him in spirit. Within ourselves, at the apexes of our sectors, each of usis Creator, for there we are one with Him; there also are we love, wisdom,power, and can create our outward lives as we will—provided that we keep ourmentality clear and unclouded for the transmission of the godlike ideal of thespirit into the bodily life.In the circle, not only is each sector the equal of every other sector beforethe law; but each of the three planes has its part to play in the perfect whole,and is therefore of equal importance with the other two. It is true that, in thecarrying out of a conception, the order is:First. The conception of the thinker, on what is the plane of the spirit, whichis subjective to mentality, although objective to the inward thinker.Second. The molding of the thinker's conception into definite shape in theworkshop of mentality, during which process the evoluting conception isobjective to mentality, but as yet only subjective to the outward bodily life.Third. The carrying out of that conception on the material plane of the body, atwhich time it is no longer merely a subjective thought, but an objective act inthe world of matter.This, as I have said, is the order. But we must not forget that great law:\"reaction is equal to action, and opposite to it in direction.\" If spirit,through mentality, acts upon body, so, likewise, does body, through mentality,react upon spirit. And, also, the impulse to vibration being set up on thebodily plane, it is transmitted through mentality to spirit, resulting in areaction from the apex of the sector outward again to the bodily plane.Let us apply this philosophy to the marital relation. Where the three planes ofbody, mentality and spirit are in fairly harmonious adjustment, as they are inall normally constituted people who seek to live aright, the bodily sex relationwith another sector and the spiritual sexual relation with that sector interactupon one another through mentality, for the good of the two creatures and thehappiness of the entire universe. For, remembering that each of us is part ofthe Great Thinker at the apex of our individual sector, it will be seen thatvibrations set up in our bodily life, and transmitted through mentality to ourapex of spirit, must affect the universe on all sides.But only the initiate of the first and second degrees in marital union canappreciate and act upon the suggestive and far-reaching conception of therelation of the individual to the universe, and of the universe to theindividual."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 3: FIRST DEGREE > Sex union forbidden,> > > > except for the express purpose> > > > of creating a child> > In married life of the usual type, children are brought into the world with astrange recklessness. The Bible command, \"Be fruitful and multiply,\" has beentwisted into a sanction for immoderate sex union. So far as can be learned, menappear to be here the chief trespassers upon the privileges of the matrimonialstate. But if men are the aggressors, their wives are too often accessoriesbefore the fact, in that they yield their bodies to marital excess without amurmur, inwardly assuring themselves that by so doing, they are obeying God'sbehest to be dutiful wives. I recall a charming woman, whose husband is intelligent, refined and thoroughlydevoted to his wife. Both are devout Christians; both abhor drunkenness, and areliving lives of purity and aspiration, so far as an outsider can see. Yet thishappily married wife, when discussing with me certain aspects of the maritalrelation, remarked, incidentally, \"For my part, on going to bed at night, I amusually very thankful when my husband doesn't want me, and I can go quietly tosleep.\"\"When my husband doesn't want me!\" Why should he ever approach her, unless shewants him? It is not the man, but the woman, who must be the best judge of whenunion is desirable; and for her to yield to a husband's solicitations when shedoes not desire union is a fraud upon him, since he finds only a corpse or ahypocrite in the place of a sincerely loving and tender marital partner.Moreover, it encourages him to think that, no matter what his wife desires, sheis quite willing to serve at any time as a convenience for his lust; so that sheconfirms him in his selfishness, and degrades herself from the position ofpriestess in a sacred mystery, to become a mere cuspidor.A cultivated Philadelphia lady, who lost her money and took up the profession ofnursing for her livelihood, tells the following:She was attending a young wife in her first confinement. The patient had beengreatly lacerated in delivery. On the second day after delivery, while the nursewas attending to the baby, the husband entered, and requested the nurse to leavethe room. \"For God's sake, Nurse, don't leave me!\" exclaimed the sick woman. Buta look from the husband caused the nurse to obey him, nevertheless. Shortlyafter, she heard her patient scream, \"Oh, he'll murder me!\" Whereupon the nurserushed in, and found the husband in the act of committing a rape upon his wife.The nurse seized his arm, and endeavored to pull him away; but he did not yielduntil he was ready, when he allowed himself, sullenly, to be led from the room,covered with blood. The wife meanwhile had fainted. When she recovered, shecried, \"Oh God, would that my baby girl and I could die! That man promised onour wedding-day to honor, love and protect me; but every night since then he hasused my poor body!\"This is doubtless an extreme case; but the wife who allows her husband toapproach her whenever he wishes, regardless of her own desires, is the firstterm in a downward series of which this unfortunate woman is, alas! not thelast, as many a physician can testify.In Pagan lands and among the Jews, there are five days out of every twentyeightwhen the woman is forbidden to the man; and those who violate this taboo periodare looked on as law-breakers. Folklore and religion alike memorialize theabhorrence in which the violator of this taboo period is held, everywhere exceptin Christian lands. If the reader objects that no educated or refined man wouldfail to respect the five-day taboo period, let him inquire about this of somereputable physician with whom he is intimate, when he will learn how sadlynumerous in our midst are the husbands who respect no physical condition and nonight in the month.Modern researchers have shown the impressionability of the embryo child duringgestation. Napoleon the Great owed his remarkable military genius to the factthat, prior to his birth, his mother accompanied her husband through a militarycampaign. If the coming child be so impressionable during the nine months ofgestation, it surely behooves every conscientious parent to see to it that noabandonment to passion shall occur during that period to stamp the embryo, evenfor one little moment, with lack of self-control. And, on the other hand, itwould seem as though every act of mutual considerateness and every tender caressbetween husband and wife at that time must bear its part in making their comingchild self-controlled, sweet-tempered and affectionate.But not only should the nine months of gestation be free from the abandonmentsof sex passion. So, also, according to some authorities, should the nine monthsor thereabouts be devoted to lactation. The child that is suckling is a drainupon its mother's strength, and it is cruel, at least to the child, even shouldthe mother desire it, to draw further upon her nervous energies at that time,and to probably render the milk feverish, by abandonment to sex passion. Amongso inferior a people as the Zulus and Kaffirs, the wife's person is held sacredby the husband, not only during gestation, but also during lactation. It is truethat these people have more than one wife. That is their way of dealing withthis question. But will it be pretended that a civilized, high-minded white mancannot get along during his wife's pregnancy and lactation without indulgence,and that he must choose among polygamy, association with harlots, or violationof the person of a pregnant or nursing wife? If so, he should be prohibited bylaw from ever creating a child, since he cannot become a father withoutafterward committing a crime.Some sex reformers hold that the creation of a child should not occur oftenerthan once in three years, inasmuch as a little child is entitled to the mother'spersonal care during its infancy—a care which is interfered with when the motheris passing through the delicate condition of pregnancy.At all events, it cannot be denied that, were fewer children born to a family,those who are born could be better taken care of than they are at present. Apoor man is not able to properly rear and educate a large family. Nor, indeed,can any but the very rich do this. So that, from a financial as well as from ahygienic standpoint, large families are undesirable, as being an undue tax upontheir parents and also as rendering it unlikely that proper care can be bestowedupon each individual child.But if large families are undesirable, so, also, are the usual preventive checksundesirable, being abnormal, unhealthy and immoral, whether by withdrawal orother methods. They are immoral, because they place no check upon passion, butallow it full range. They are unhealthy, because the psychic powers of bothparties are depleted, without sufficient interchange of magnetism. And being aviolation of the natural and healthy relation, they are abnormal.The only lawful preventive to conception is self-control. The seed should neverbe sown where no harvest is prepared for or desired.The wife is the one to decide when that harvest is to be desired. She should bequeen of her own person, so absolutely as she was while still a maiden. Sheshould never consent to sex union unless she desires it. Otherwise, she degradesher wifehood into prostitution, for she is then little, if any better than thecourtesan who rents her body to a man for so much money a night.The coming child should be deliberately, reverently, and prudently planned for.To choose a time when there seems to be least likelihood of conception isdegrading the generative powers for purposes of sensuality. Moreover, the wifeis less desirous of union at such times. Nature's appointed love-season is,almost without exception, during the day or days immediately following themonthly taboo period. Those who allow this natural wedding-time to pass, and whounite two weeks later, at the ebb-tide of the woman's passion, should not besurprised if she manifests only indifference or disgust, instead of tenderaffection.Another thing: It must be remembered that the seed should be sown with the honest intention ofproducing a harvest. When it has been sown, it behooves husband and wife towait, it may be for weeks or even months, to learn, beyond the possibility of amistake, whether the seed has germinated or not. And of course, when pregnancyis assured, no further seed need be sown.This is the teaching of the First Degree. Not until the initiate shall have grasped the teaching in its fullness, will hebe worthy to enter upon the training for the Second Degree."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 4: SECOND DEGREE > Sex union enjoined> > > > in absolute self-control> > > > and aspiration to the highest> > In sex union there are two functions concerned—love and parentage. Likewise,there are two sets of organs for the performance of these functions. The organsof parentage are, in the woman, the ovaries and uterus; in the man, thetesticles and vesiculae seminalae.The organs of love are those which contact during sex union; and through these,when the union is normal and on a high plane, an interchange of magnetismresults which is helpful and strengthening to both parties.To secure a thorough equipoise of the whole being, it is important that thelove-function have healthy and normal exercise at frequent intervals. But thefunction of parentage should be very rarely exercised; and intervals of yearsmay elapse, without detriment to the health and general well-being, providedthat the love-function be exercised in moderation and upon a high planemeanwhile.If the reader asks, incredulously, how, on the man's part, the love-function maybe healthfully exercised without the wasteful scattering of seed supposed to bea necessary climax to each marital union, I would refer him to a little bookcalled Zugassent's Discovery, written by Geo. N. Miller.214[index_split_027.html#filepos581160] I would also refer him to the accounts ofthe Oneida Community, where for thirty years, this possibility was demonstrated.Also to Karezza, by Alice C. Stockham, M.D.215[index_split_027.html#filepos581454]If it be asked how this power of self-control is to be attained, I answer: bydegrees, as one would acquire proficiency in any athletic exercise or any art.One should resolutely decide at the outset that no seed shall be scattered, nomatter what the impulse may be at the moment, and should sternly abide by hisself-registered vow, to the best of his ability. It is quite likely that one ortwo failures may result at first; but as the power of self-control is developed,it becomes more and more possible for a man to do here just what he wills. Andno man who has once acquired this power will ever care to return to the oldhabit of abandonment to passion; for he will see that he was then a slave,whereas now he is a king. (Again, I would remind the reader that asceticselfdenial is Nature's appointed gateway to increased sense-pleasure.)In India, the philosophy of sex relations reached this high standard centuriesago; and today, such power of self-control appears to be a well-nigh universalinheritance among the natives.This is the first half of the teaching of the Second Degree—the ability tosuppress at will the scattering of the seed.Its effects are not only bodily, but psychic as well; and the husband who hasacquired this power can frequently turn a passive, indifferent marital partnerinto a tender wife.One reason why many women manifest indifference or disgust in the marital unionis that women are usually slower in coming to the climax than are men.Affection, tender considerateness, gentleness and delicacy on the man's part,accompanied by the exercise of prolonged and absolutely self-controlled union,would transform many a merely tolerated husband into a welcome lover.But the wife, also, has her part to play, and should look well to the managementof her own sex powers. She must learn not to abandon herself to emotion, anymore than she would willingly yield to a horse that is trying to run away withher. Let her act with her emotions as she would strive to act with such ahorse—control with whip and bridle, and make herself absolute mistress of thecreature. But let her also remember that to kill a horse is not to govern it.When both parties shall have acquired this self-control, they will begin tounderstand somewhat of the beauty and joy of psychic wedlock.An objection sometimes raised by men is that, on grounds of health, a bodilysecretion needs to be gotten rid of at frequent intervals. That depends. In thecase of tears, it is not so. We may go for months and years without suffering inhealth from not weeping; and yet, if occasion arise, the secretion is formedinstantaneously in response to our need. Why should not other secretions whichare evoked by occasional emotion be ranked in the same category as tears?It will of course be understood that the above does not apply to any secretionin the nature of a mucous fluid which is intended by Nature merely for purposesof lubrication. The Second Degree prohibits only that which is ejaculated—i.e.,the masculine creative seed.A more reasonable objection, however, is that, after a secretion is formed, itcannot be returned to the system without detriment to health. But Dr.Brown-Sequard216 [index_split_027.html#filepos581695] has asserted thatrepression at the last moment and restoring the seminal secretion to the systemprolongs a man's life and adds to his vigor. Dr. Brown-Sequard, however, seemsto have made the mistake of supposing that it mattered not by what means eitherthe secretion or the repression of that secretion was induced. Hence his theoryabout obtaining the \"Elixir of Life\" at such a moment from guinea-pigs, bullsand other male animals in which the secretion had been artificially induced—atheory which careful scientific experiment duly exploded. His crucial mistakelay in his not grasping the fact that the excitation should occur in a normalmanner, that the repression should be voluntary, and not brought about by anymeans but self-control, and that the strengthening value of the secretionconsists in its being returned to the system to which it belongs.Again I would remind the reader that the power evolved by the practice of theSecond Degree is psychic, as well as physical.Every ejaculation means a waste in psychic energy—a waste which may becounterbalanced in part by the exchange of magnetism in a tender marital union,but which can never wholly be made up.I have said that the first half of the Second Degree consists in the ability torepress the ecstasy entirely, however prolonged the union. And this power shouldbe acquired by the wife, as well as by the husband. The second half consists ingoing through the final ecstasy in absolute self-control, and with noejaculation.This is a step beyond the teaching of even the Oneida Community, and I cannotrefer the reader to any books upon the subject. But there are today men who haveacquired even this power.In this stage, also, the woman should go through with a corresponding trainingin self-control. To use a figure of speech, one may compare the last half of theSecond Degree to struggling through a mountain torrent. Again and again, as westrive to breast the dangerous stream, we are swept from our footing and nearlysubmerged; yet each time we manage to keep our head above water, and at last weemerge triumphantly on the other side, clamber up the steep bank, and go on ourway, rejoicing in the consciousness of our strength.The dangers attending the practice of this Second Degree by the unworthyinitiate are serious. It may be made the means of sensual excesses which degradethe moral nature and break down the health. I am inclined to agree, it is true,with other writers on the subject, in maintaining that, to the selfish man andthe libertine, the game is not worth the candle. Nevertheless, I should not bedoing my duty by the general reader were I to fail to utter a word of warning,and to insist that only in moderation and aspiration to the highest may theSecond Degree be safely practiced. Not only this. The Second Degree, without theThird and Final Degree, is not only imperfect, but is certain in time to becomedemoralizing, inasmuch as it deals chiefly with prolonged sense-pleasure uponthe planes of body and mentality alone.Let us, therefore, now turn to the consideration of the Third and HighestDegree, which is the one in which our spiritual natures find activity."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 5: THIRD DEGREE > Communion with Deity> > > > as the third partner> > > > in the marital union> > In the chapter on the Individual and the Universe, a philosophical conceptionwas set forth which represented the Great Thinker at the heart of the universeas consisting of the sum of minds which exist throughout nature. Reaction beingequal to action and opposite to it in direction, we showed that although ourinward spirit sends impulses outward through mentality into our bodily life, yetit is logical to infer that vibrations set up on the bodily plane will reactthrough mentality upon our spirit; and since that within us which thinks may beconsidered to be part of the Directing Spirit of the universe, our bodily life,by transmission through our mentality and this Central Thinker, probably actsupon the entire universe. If this hypothesis be accepted as logical, it would seem to be the duty of eachof us to so live that our bodily acts shall result in help and happiness to therest of the universe. The old-fashioned books tell us that we have within us asafe guide, called Conscience. Modern philosophy, however, has demonstrated thatConscience needs to be enlightened in order to be thoroughly reliable. Of onething, nevertheless, we may be reasonably certain. If we endeavor, to the bestof our ability, to keep our mentality free from prejudice, dislike andignorance, so that the light from our higher, inward self shall stream throughmentality uncolored and unrefracted, we shall be quite safe in following theguidance of that mysterious inner something which we term \"Conscience.\"This the Atheist would call living in harmony with law, inasmuch as itnecessitates clear-headedness as its first requisite. The Theist would call itseeking to know the will of God.Prayer is one of the ways of clearing our mentality, so that the vibratoryimpulses may be correctly transmitted from That Which Thinks, outward throughour mentality into our bodily life. Prayer is also a means of transmittingthrough our mentality, to the Great Thinker at the heart of the universe, theresults of what we do on the bodily plane, for the betterment of the entireuniverse.When, under the powerful influence of sex emotion, the psycho-physical thresholdof sensibility is displaced, an especially intimate communication is opened up,whether we wish it or not, between our bodily lives and the Great Thinker. If weaspire to act in unison with that Great Thinker at such a moment, the vibrationsset up within us by the sex emotion must result not only in our own betterment,but in joy and help to all the world.This is the first half of the Third Degree—the duty of aspiration during the sexecstasy to communion with the Great Thinker.And the second half of this degree is the joy accruing both to the Great Thinkerand to ourselves through such communion.The Hindus have a belief which many people would term a superstition, to theeffect that a god can enjoy material pleasures, but only when his worshipperoffers him a share. And so the devout Hindu offers his god a share of his foodand drink and even of his debaucheries, believing that he may enjoy himself ashe will, if only he gives the god a part. That is, of course, a degradation ofwhat is really a beautiful and inspiring idea—the idea that God can and doesenjoy the material world through our enjoyment.The second half of the Third Degree is entered upon when we realize that perhapsit is possible for us individually, after all, to give to the Great Thinker apleasure which no one else can, and when, out of sheer benevolence andgood-will, and with no selfish desire to secure our own pleasure, we offer theGreat Thinker a share in our delight, asking Him to become the third partner inthe marital union. Pantheos, Personal God or Impersonal, Unknowable Force as maybe that Great Thinker, nevertheless, if this offering be sincerely andreverently made, there will dawn upon the twain who are one flesh a realizingsense of the personal relation between themselves and the heart of the universe,which is obtainable in no other way. For the time being, they will know what itis to \"love God\" and to be loved by Him, and will be one with all the universe,in a rapture which is indescribable. And because at that moment the way liesclear and unclouded between their bodily lives and the Great Thinker, theinitiates of the Third Degree will realize in all its fullness genuine psychicwedlock—i.e., sex union upon all three planes of body, mentality and spirit, inthe exact equation which constitutes the ideal union of husband and wife.Image [images/00013.jpg]I have tried to set forth, with such clearness as seemed admissible in a workintended for the general public, the fundamental principles of genuine psychicwedlock—the only sort of union, it seems to me, which men and women ought toseek in the sex relation. Having succeeded at times in living up to thisphilosophy myself, I speak of its possibilities as one who knows. And so I amsending out this little essay, hoping that others, both husbands and wives, withwider lives than mine, may be helped thereby to attain the ideal happiness ofPsychic Wedlock."},{"pageContent":"SPIRITUAL JOYS (EXCERPT FROM \"THE MARRIAGE RELATION,\" 1900) An experience of sex union in which the controlled orgasm and sustained thrillby both husband and wife are passed through, with the Central Force of theUniverse, the Impulsive Power of Primordial Matter, as the third partner, is anexperience never to be forgotten; an experience which, once had, will be longedfor again. > \"O to realize space!> > > > The plenteousness of all, that there are no bounds,> > > > To emerge and be of the sky, of the sun and moon and flying clouds, as one> with them!\"> > So panted Walt Whitman. What he yearned for in those lines may at times berealized by the husband and wife who have learned how to enter into theself-controlled and ecstatic triune sex partnership with the Impulsive Power ofPrimordial Matter. I say \"at times,\" for, as I have already stated, no two suchunions with the Infinite Force are exactly alike; and the sexual thrills ofdelight which permeate one's entire being during such a union, physically,mentally and spiritually, now all at the moment, and again alternating with oneanother in successive vibrations of rapture, are never satiating. It does not get to be an old story; there is a new delight at each union, and awider apprehension of the pervasiveness of God's presence. Sometimes, indeed, itis as though \"space\" and \"the plenteousness of all, that there are no bounds,\"for whose realization Walt Whitman so passionately longed, had begun to beunderstood. Again—and now I must speak rather in the figurative terms of themystic, for it is well-high impossible to express subjective experiencesaccurately in spoken language—it is as though the Great Power Of All There Isheld one by a firm, tender hand, detained in a secret retreat of exquisitebeauty, where vivid colors and softly rounded forms are seen, and where, forsome organizations, fragments of soul-stirring melodies rise and fall upon theinner ear, and where, for some other organizations, rhythmical waves of poeticmeasure may pulsate to and fro until, in ever wider and wider arcs, fragments ofthese, also, sweep up through the subliminal consciousness to the very thresholdof the intellectual consciousness itself, and part of a poem is thus projectedfrom the Infinite Heart of the Universe into the heart of the individual. Andagain it may be as though one were privileged to see into Chaos ere theformative period of the world began. Strange blendings of colors surge to andfro, without order or place; or purposeless vibrations of sound are heard; orvague shapes flit about one, now separate, now blending like storm clouds. Then,suddenly, as the individual exerts his or her spiritual self-control, theseindistinct and purposeless shapes and colors and sounds begin to crystallizeinto that which is definite; and the trained mystic gets a glimpse in a way notto be expressed in words, of how the Purposive Center of All Thought-Force inthe universe originally worked a Cosmos out of Chaos. Or, again, the onrush ofsex passion in this triune partnership may appear to the inner senses as therapids of a Niagara, into which no untrained neophyte may dare to enter, for hewill be swept onward to destruction. But the husband and wife who have known thebliss of the controlled orgasm and sustained thrill in partnership with the MostHigh, tremble on the verge of these mystic rapids but for a moment, and thenenter, to find themselves, as it were, at the very Heart of those forces whichfirst sent the nebulous, unformed mass of our solar universe whirling intospace. They are in Chaos, but a Chaos which is being evolved into a Cosmos. Theystruggle in the foaming rapids of sexual creative passion, they and God all onetogether; the impetuous current seems momentarily about to sweep them from theirfeet, and they breast the waves in a delicious, thrilling agony; yet all thewhile they know themselves to be so firmly God-centered that, sway to and fro inthe whirl of sex passion as they may, to be swept to destruction will nothappen. Suddenly, as an especially high and impetuous wave of passion is met andsurmounted with the most intensely voluptuous thrill yet experienced in thistriune partnership, they feel firm ground beneath their feet; they bracethemselves for a final dash through the lesser rapids, and emerge on the fartherbank, triumphant, serene, mutually uplifted; they climb with steady andtranquilized nerves the heights of affection and spirituality; and on that highplateau they walk in the lovelight of the Divine, blended soul and body in awedded union whose happiness can never be expressed in words.Sometimes during such a triune partnership or at its close, God is sensed as wewere wont, when very, very small children, to sense our mother—a powerful,mysterious being of loftier stature than ourselves, in trailing robe, to whom welooked up with awe and to whom we clung as our protector; a being whose presenceradiated a comforting soul warmth, whose hands showered blessings on us if wehad been good children, and whose voice vibrated firmly, yet was tender withlove; and nevertheless a vaguely understood and somewhat feared personalityafter all.The closer one gets to God in a triune sex union, the more awful and gloriousand majestic appears the Divine Impulsive Force of the Universe, and yet themore unspeakably tender.At times it is as though one stood beside the Engineer who, with hand onthrottle, guides the rushing, mighty train of Universal Nature, and one feels aninexpressible thrill of delight at being so close to the Heart Of All There Is.And forever through and through these strange mystic experiences, be itremembered, bodily sexual desire and bodily sexual bliss rise and fall like thesurging waves of the ocean.The philosophy of the triune partnership is an old, old Oriental teaching, andlies at the base of all true occultism, although it is rarely taught to any butadvanced students, and then usually under a pledge of secrecy. It is centuriesupon centuries old; but when given forth, either orally or in writing, it hasbeen hitherto presented in a veiled way, which only the initiate couldunderstand; so fearful have the mystics been of this holy and precious truthbeing trampled underfoot or turned to base uses.For the first time in the history of the race, this sacred inner truth is givenopenly to the public, in this book and in the more condensed but lessphilosophic pamphlets which have preceded it. It is fitting that this importantteaching, so fraught with blessing for humanity, should come to the world withthe dawning of the twentieth century and in the land where freedom of thoughtand the triumphs of modern material science and diffused popular education domost obtain. America and Americans are ripe for the teaching.198 [index_split_020.html#filepos497285] Carl Kellner (1851–1905) was anAustrian industrialist, Freemason, and Theosophist whose wealth allowed him totravel widely.

In herdiary for June 20, Ida notes that her mother had come to London and helped hermove into a nicer room. But it wasn't until the summer of 1895 that Ida feltcomfortable enough to return to the United States. In July, she was back inPhiladelphia, living with her mother again, although still wary, as her motherhad threatened to burn all of her precious manuscripts given the chance. Thiskind of ambivalence was characteristic of Ida's relationship with her motherthroughout her life; in 1889, she wrote to a friend that she would not live withher mother after returning from California, yet she always eventually found herway back to Lizzie Decker's house at 1032 Race Street in Philadelphia. In 1895,Ida wrote to her patron W. T. Stead: > Poor Mother! It must be awfully hard lines for her, I feel sure. She would so> like to have me conventional, and I can't be, in the way she wishes. But if> she would only help me to work out my propagandism, I could get where she> wants me to; but it would be later on, and upon a much higher plane than she> now aspires for me.

And if> no other way offers, I shall (because I must) leave Mother's side, and do my> work by myself. At first, she did try to be conventional, as her mother wished, but the need tospread her \"gospel\" kept calling. She was convinced that her teachings about sexcould solve many ills of society by increasing marital satisfaction, and thusreducing the incidence of divorce, prostitution, and venereal disease. She feltthat her message was too important and its benefits too great for her to remainsilent. Not wanting trouble from the law, in 1896 she met with the InspectorGeneral of the Philadelphia post office, who informed her that according to theComstock Law, it was illegal to send any writing about sex through the mail,regardless of the motives of the author. Discouraged, she wrote in her diary: > Why should I remain here all my days, fretting my heart out, worrying to keep> out of the clutches of the law?

With these prophetic words, Ida took up her cause as a social reformer, managingto stay out of the clutches of the law by spreading her gospel directly toindividuals, teaching and counseling them one-on-one. In 1897, she rented anoffice on Arch Street in Philadelphia, not far from her mother's house. She paidthe rent by doing secretarial work for the Bureau of Highways at City Hallnearby. During this time, Ida became exposed to the sexual concerns and complaints of awide range of ordinary men and women who made up her clientele: young and old;single, married, and widowed; lawyers, doctors, schoolteachers, and housewives.She kept notes of her sessions with each client, which she later compiled into aseries of eighty-seven case studies under the title \"Records of Cases of MaritalReform Work,\" following the format of pioneering sexologist Krafft-Ebing'sPsychopathia Sexualis.218 [index_split_031.html#filepos703561] She alsodeveloped a program of \"Regeneration and Rejuvenation of Men and Women throughthe Right Use of the Sex Function,\" which required her clients to answer aninety-eight-item \"diagnosis\" questionnaire, anticipating Kinsey by forty years.By listening to her clients, answering their questions, and dispensing advice,she fulfilled a badly needed function halfway between that of doctor andminister, drawing praise from members of both professions even though she had noformal training in either. (The nascent field of psychotherapy was just beingdeveloped by Freud in Vienna at the time.)With the experience she gained through personal contact came a shift in Ida'swriting, from the spiritual and ideal to the worldly and practical. The resultwas Right Marital Living, written in 1899 as a distillation of Ida's philosophyon marital reform. The cornerstone of Right Marital Living was still sexualself-control, consistent with her earlier writings, but the emphasis was placedmore on its personal advantages to marital happiness and sexual satisfaction,and the resulting societal benefits of stronger marriages and fewer unwantedchildren. This was followed a year later by The Wedding Night, an even morepractical pamphlet containing advice for the bride and groom about to undertakesex for the first time. Some further development of Ida's theoreticalfoundations may also be discerned in these works. Right Marital Livingelaborates on the concept of \"sexual magnetism\" mentioned briefly in \"PsychicWedlock,\" quoting directly from Chavannes on the doctrine of \"magnetation,\"219[index_split_031.html#filepos704062] and The Wedding Night manages toincorporate yoga, newly introduced to America by Vivekananda220[index_split_031.html#filepos704513] whom Ida had recently read. The main thrustof both these works, however, remained practical instruction.It may be difficult for us today to appreciate the true significance of thesocial changes Ida advocated in Right Marital Living and The Wedding Night. Ofcourse, many of her views on sexuality were firmly rooted in the prejudices andmisconceptions of the time. For example, she subscribed to the well-establishedbeliefs that masturbation was unhealthy, male ejaculation resulted in a \"loss ofnerve energy,\" and a child conceived while its father was drunk would be born\"mentally unbalanced.\" She also opposed all forms of artificial contraception(though this put her at odds with her Freethought colleague Dr. Foote),correctly pointing out that the methods of the time were both unreliable andillegal, but also considering them to be masturbative and morally degrading.These positions were still within the mainstream consensus of 1890s America.Some of her other ideas were controversial for the time and remain so today. In1893, she wrote a letter to the editor of the Philadelphia Public Ledger,commenting upon the case of a gang rape reported by the paper. She noted thatimprisonment alone would probably not prevent the offenders from raping againafter their release, and recommended thorough training in sexual self-control;until such training was available, however, she maintained that rapists shouldbe castrated. In The Wedding Night, she went so far as to suggest infant femalecircumcision and even clitoral excision in extreme cases (for women who have an\"abnormally long clitoris\"), practices that were not unheard of in her time andthat unfortunately continue today.221 [index_split_031.html#filepos704973]In spite of her limitations, however, many of the things she wrote about maritalsexuality were extremely progressive, to the point of being revolutionary forher time. Foremost was her contention that there are two physiological functionsof sex—one for pleasure and one for procreation—and that both of these arenaturally and morally independent. This was a direct challenge to the notionthat the sole purpose of sex is reproductive, and that pleasure is a side effectmerely intended (whether by God or by evolution) to encourage reproduction. Theidea that sexual pleasure is subordinate to mating still has currency today; forexample, it is often invoked in the debate over same-sex marriage. But for Ida,it was clear that the organs of the \"love function\" were able to operateindependently from the organs of the \"parental function\" without threat to one'sphysical or spiritual health. By learning to control these functions separately,it would be possible to make conception a conscious decision for parents, notthe hit-or-miss proposition that it usually was. Ida was concerned about thetoll exacted by repeated childbearing on the health of women of the time, aswell as the social problems created by having more children than a family couldsupport. Maternal and infant mortality rates were extremely high in the late19th century. Ida empowered couples to mitigate these risks and reduce unwantedpregnancies by teaching them to choose when to conceive. Although opposed toabortion, she was definitely \"pro choice\" when it came to conception.Furthermore, Ida insisted that desire and pleasure were just as important forthe female as for the male in a satisfying relationship.222[index_split_031.html#filepos705678] She took a stand against the long-acceptedassumption that it was a wife's \"marital duty\" to provide sex for her husbandwhether she wanted it or not, bluntly stating that the wife who submits to sexwithout desiring it herself was no better than a harlot—worse than a harlot infact, because at least the harlot is paid for her compliance! She alsorecognized that a husband who sexually imposes himself on his wife against herwill is guilty of rape, which was inconceivable in American society at the time.In fact, a husband could not be charged with the rape of his wife in most statesuntil the laws began to change in the 1970s. Once again, Ida proved to be wayahead of her time.223 [index_split_031.html#filepos706110]Some other radical ideas she advocated included recommending at least twenty tothirty minutes of foreplay (which she called \"lovemaking\") before intercourse,to allow time for the woman's lubrication and desire to build; encouragingpacing on the part of the man to ensure that the woman would have theopportunity to orgasm as well; suggesting a variety of sexual positions andpassionate (but controlled) pelvic movements; and even allowing for sex duringpregnancy, should the woman crave it. All of these prescriptions were extremelybold for the 1890s and 1900s, as they promoted sexual parity in the bedroom at atime when women were not even allowed to vote. But Ida's pamphlets were alsoradical for the simple fact that they were addressing sexual subjects at all. Toher clients and supporters, among them respected physicians, her frank anddirect handling of such specific subjects as how to deal with a tough hymen or a\"matrimonial misfit\" (even if today we might cringe at the \"electricaltreatment\" prescribed to enlarge the male organ in such a case) were badlyneeded and unavailable anywhere else.To crusaders of moral decency such as Anthony Comstock, however, any opendiscussion of sex was \"obscene, lewd, and lascivious\" and therefore illegal todisseminate. Ida was well aware of the risk, and took precautions like requiringorders for her pamphlets to be submitted on pre-printed professional letterhead.But she felt that her mission was too critical to be compromised by mere threatsfrom the law, and she forged boldly ahead, counseling clients and distributingRight Marital Living and The Wedding Night to all who might benefit from heradvice.Image [images/00015.jpg]> Figure 6. One of many letters of praise for Right Marital Living and The> Wedding Night, from the Ida Craddock papers, courtesy of SCRC."},{"pageContent":"RIGHT MARITAL LIVING (1899) The following essay is an expansion of an article of mine upon this samesubject, which appeared in the Chicago Clinic, for May, 1899. It is published inresponse to requests from physicians and others all over the country for asimple, clear presentation of my teaching which could be handed by physicians totheir patients and circulated among men and women who desire to know how to livehealthy, wholesome, chaste lives as husband and wife. Among these correspondents a noted gynecologist of New York City writes to me asfollows:> If your method can be taught, it will almost entirely do away with adultery in> either sex, it will aid in suppressing prostitution, and do many things that> will make the world better and happier. In the marital relation, there are two physiological functions—the love functionand the parental function. These two functions are not always exercisedconjointly. There are also two sets of organs for these two functions,respectively. For the parental function, in the woman, the organs are the ovaries and theuterus (the womb); in the man, they are the testicles and the vesiculaeseminales. The organs of the love function are those which contact—the erectileorgan in man; the vulva (the external genitals) and the vagina in woman. Theuterus, however, also seems to be with many women a love organ; for, during thefinal ecstasy, where the man's organ is not sufficiently long to touch it, theuterus frequently descends into the vagina, as though seeking contact. It isprobable that the uterus is intended by nature to always take part in theculmination of the act; but this, it will be observed, is merely as an organ ofcontact. When the uterus becomes a receptacle, it is then a parental organ.The love function may and ought to be exercised periodically, in order that bothhusband and wife may have a healthy, well balanced physique and mentality.The parental function may remain for years unexercised, without harm to eitherhusband or wife.It is popularly supposed that the love function should never be brought intoplay without at least an abortive attempt at exercising the parental function.That is, when the love organs of husband and wife have been brought intocontact, it is supposed that the man's creative semen ought to be ejaculated,even though a child begotten at that time would be brought into the world underthe worst possible circumstances—circumstances which would result in its beingborn a pauper or an idiot, or predisposed to drunkenness or insanity orcriminality. To this mistaken belief (namely, that an attempt at parenthoodshould always terminate sexual intercourse)—a belief rooted in the popular mindby centuries of wrong living—the well-being of the future generation is dailysacrificed.Of course, preventives to conception are always wrong. And there never yet was apreventive invented which is certain. Moreover, they are all forbidden by law;and to sell a preventive, or to lend it, or to give it away, or to state whereor how it can be procured, is to commit an offense which, if known to theauthorities, renders the party liable to a heavy fine or imprisonment, or both.Most preventives are distinctly injurious to one or both parties at the time;many are said to injure the tissues of the woman later on. If used, they put nocheck upon passion; and they are, all of them, abominable and degrading. Thecondoms, womb veils and pessaries, by interposing a foreign tissue between thegenital organs of husband and wife during the act, render the relationsmasturbative for both parties. So do the various suppositories, which, bydissolving, cover the walls of the vagina with a coating of foreign substance.The syringe, by driving the spermatozoa nearer the mouth of the uterus, oftenhelps along the very thing it is intended to prevent; and some physicians claimthat, as it must be used while the tissues are still engorged, the shock isinjurious to the woman. It likewise detracts from the delicacy of the conjugalact, for people of refinement. Withdrawal is an act of onanism; it is unhealthyand morally degrading. And men who habitually practice it are apt to carry thesign of their unclean habit marked on their faces and in their manner, for allknowing people to read. The popular fourteen day period (two weeks after themenses) is decidedly not a sure preventive, as a woman can become pregnant atany time in the month; and it is unnatural to have intercourse at the time inthe month when the wife least desires it. Such coition tends to make her loathethe performance of her conjugal duty.All these methods are degrading; they all coarsen what should be a pure andexquisite attraction; and at any moment they may fail to prevent conception, andwill then, through the wife, stamp the child with unwholesome tendencies, mentalperversions, or physical deformities.Yet, to refrain from exercising the parental function (the ejaculation ofcreative semen) during coition, and to exercise only the love function (that is,the function of prolonged genital contact which mutually refreshes, stimulatesand upbuilds the entire nervous system) is popularly supposed to be eitherunhealthy or impossible.This is because, for many, many centuries, men have been perverting the naturalfunctions of their sexual organism, until that which is really the best way hascome to seem impossible to the many, and unwise to the few who have learned thatit is not impossible. I refer to the suppression of the ejaculation of the semenupon all occasions, except at the time when the creation of a child has beenprepared for by both husband and wife.Let us remember that the seminal fluid is bestowed by Nature upon man for onepurpose only—the creation of a child. It is quite true that Nature, in order tosecure the propagation of the race, surrounds the act of creation with all sortsof allurements. If it were not so, people would seldom take the trouble to begetchildren. But the semen itself is given, not for mere sensual gratification, butfor a creative purpose. To turn it aside from its natural purpose is to livewrongly as a husband. Also, to create children at random and by the wholesale,or in an environment unsuitable for either the mother or the child, is adegradation of the holy power of fatherhood.If, then, the semen has been bestowed by Nature on man for the one purpose ofcreation, it is wrong to sow any seed in a woman after the child has begun todevelop, for it is unnecessary, and is a waste of precious material. Now it isusually necessary to wait for over four months after the seed has been sown, inorder to determine with certainty whether or not it has germinated. It is truethat physicians do sometimes make fortunate guesses much earlier; but it issafer to wait until four or four and a half months shall have elapsed, by whichtime not only will the child have quickened, but also it will have becomepossible for a physician, by means of a stethoscope, to hear the child's heartbeat. The latter is held to be the one sure sign by which to determine theexistence of pregnancy; and if the educated ear of the physician distinguishesthe quick beating of the child's heart then, separate from the slower beat ofthe mother's heart, of course there will be no further need for seed-sowing atthat time. To persist in sowing seed during the remaining months of pregnancy isa violation of natural law.It is true that a woman is sometimes more amorous during pregnancy than at othertimes, owing to the swollen condition of the uterus, which induces excitement atthe genitals, so that she craves sexual satisfaction. Just as when a woman,during pregnancy, craves a peach or other wholesome food, she should be allowedto have it, so if she craves sexual intercourse during pregnancy, she ought tobe allowed to have it; but only in moderation, and with care not to press uponthe uterus, either from without or from within, in such a way as to injure thegrowing child. Of course this should not be made an occasion for seed-sowing.Genital contact should take place only for the purpose of interchanging sexualmagnetism.During the nursing period, it is unwise to unduly excite the mother sexually, asit is apt to render the milk feverish, and this will injuriously affect theinfant. And to render the mother pregnant while nursing, as is sometimes done,is cruel to her and to both children.And, surely, a little child is entitled to the care of its mother during thefirst two years of its life, is it not? Now, everyone knows that the care of amother for a young child is likely to be interfered with, if she be undergoingthe nervous fluctuations of pregnancy.This brings the time for a man's abstaining from ejaculation of semen up to twoyears and nine months—say, in round numbers, three years. But he may have sexualintercourse with his wife during that time, if he will refrain from ejaculatingthe semen.> It is popularly, but mistakenly, supposed that the semen is an excretion which> a man needs to get rid of periodically. But the reverse is the truth. \"The> male semen,\" says Dr. W. Xavier Sudduth,224> [index_split_031.html#filepos706528] a well-known nervous specialist of> Chicago, \"is an acknowledged tonic, ready prepared for absorption into the> system.\" Every expenditure of semen means a loss of nerve energy.

Some years ago, Dr. Brown-Sequard discovered that the voluntary suppression ofthe ejaculation of the semen, just at the last moment, strengthens a man andconduces to long life. He wrongly inferred, however, that the strengtheningeffect of this suppression was due entirely to the semen, thus returned to thebody; whereas it seems to be largely due to the mental act of self-control inaccomplishing the suppression, which thus acts as a tonic for the nervoussystem.An impression prevails among both physicians and the laity, that to exercise theorgans of the love function without also at least an abortive attempt on theman's part at exercising the parental function, will be prejudicial to hisnervous system, and, consequently to his health. That is, that it is dangerousto suppress the ejaculation of the semen during coition. This may be true, ifthe act of suppression be performed merely as a means for bodily, sensualenjoyment. It is not true, however, if the mentality (which, in its turn, as weall know, governs the nervous system) be kept in a state of serenity andexaltation, so that the inner spiritual forces may be brought into play.It is a medical dictum that the nervous system regulates the bodily functions,and that these functions are perceptibly affected, for better or for worse,according as the nervous system itself is in good or in bad working order. Now,the nervous system is controlled by the mentality. And the mentality can becontrolled by the inward self of the person—if he so desires.Take the matter of blushing. A blush is caused by a mental state ofembarrassment, of mortification, of exhilaration, or of passionate feeling. Thismental state acts upon the nervous system; the nerves act upon the capillaries;the capillaries call the blood to the face and the face gets red. Childrenredden easily with very slight provocation; but, as they grow older and, withadvancing years, more self-controlled, they tend less and less to crimsonuncomfortably under trying circumstances. People sometimes explain this bysaying that a grown person has become \"less sensitive.\" What has really happenedis, that the grown person, little by little, has learned to resist anysuggestion on the part of his mentality that there is something to get red inthe face about. That is, he has found out how to control his mentality in thisparticular, and, through the mentality, his nervous system, and through thenervous system, the capillaries, so that he need no longer blush, when to do sowould render him annoyingly conspicuous.The self-control which people usually learn to exercise in the matter ofblushing, may be extended to other bodily functions, in many surprising ways.But, in order to do this intelligently, one needs to understand how important itis to have one's mentality well under control. It is important, because it isimpossible for us to issue our commands directly to our bodies. All commandsmust be issued to the Mentality, and, through Mentality, be transmitted to thenervous system, which, in its turn, regulates the bodily functions. Thus, if wewish our hand to move, we may say, \"Hand, move!\" and we may keep on saying thisto all eternity, but our hand will never move until we think, \"I wish my hand tomove!\" That is, we practically say to our Mentality, \"Mentality, I wish my handto move!\" Thereupon, Mentality transmits, with more or less accuracy (accordingas we have trained it well or ill), our command to the nervous system; thenerves act upon the muscles; the muscles contract and the hand moves.If we wish the hand to perform a difficult piece of music on the piano, we mustearnestly and resolutely give instructions to Mentality over and over again,until Mentality gets so well trained, that our slightest suggestion issufficient to cause Mentality to attend to the muscular exercise of our handswith thoroughness and nicety, like a well drilled servant, leaving our inwardand higher self meanwhile free to occupy itself with other thoughts, if we sodesire.What can be done (through Mentality) in enabling the hand to master a difficultpiece of piano music, can be done similarly with other muscles of the body,especially with those which participate in the sexual embrace; but it must be bycontrolling Mentality.The orgasm, according to Dr. Sudduth, \"represents the height of nervous tension;it is a mental and physical act combined, which it is impossible to accomplishon a purely physical plane.\"Control Mentality, therefore, from the plane of the higher, inward self, and youcan control the orgasm (the ecstasy, or final thrill) which is set going byMentality.> How can this be done?> > > > There are three steps in the process:> > > > > > > (1) Total suppression of the orgasm itself when it is still afar off.> > > > > (2) Going gradually nearer and nearer to the verge, and stopping at the last> > moment, without the orgasm, and consequently, without ejaculation of semen.> > > > > (3) Going right through the orgasm, with the controlled and sustained> > thrill, but without any ejaculation of the semen; unless it be desired to> > create a child at that especial time, when the semen may be ejaculated at> > will.> > The first step (total suppression of the orgasm) is accomplished thus: justbefore the last thrill which precedes ejaculation, all motion on the part ofboth husband and wife should be promptly desisted from, and, on the man's part,the thoughts should be completely turned away from the bodily sensations, andfixed on something beyond and above the body. If he believe in God, let him pray to God at that moment, not only consecratinghis body to God and praying for strength, but also asking God to be the thirdpartner.If he be an Atheist and a Materialist, let him seek, in thought, to be inharmony at that moment with Nature, with the Ideal, the Beautiful, the True;with the Ultimate Force, the Unconscious Energy of the universe.This last is strictly logical, from a Materialistic standpoint. For theMaterialist insists that there is but one substance in all the universe, Matter,and that from Matter, every known force is produced, whether physical, mental,or emotional. Now, since it has already been demonstrated by physicists thatcertain physical forces, such as motion, heat, light, etc., may be transmuted,one into another, and that it is only a question of the difference ofvibrations; and since these physical forces, according to Materialism, are allof them manifestations of the Ultimate Force; and since, as we all know, themental state of a person has a very important effect on his bodily condition: itlogically follows, from the Materialistic standpoint, that if a givenaccumulation of thought force can be restored to the Ultimate Force of theuniverse, it may, under suitable conditions, be transmuted into some other forcewhich correlates with the Ultimate Force—say, the force of physical vibrationalong the nerves of the body. That is, the man sends thought force into what maybe considered the laboratory of the universe—the plane of Ultimate Force, ofUnconscious Energy, of the Primal Cause—where it is worked over and re-issued tohim on the plane of physical vibration. It went into the laboratory of UltimateForce as thought vibration; it returns to him (provided he has sent it thereunder the right conditions) as physical thrills which intensify his bodilysensation and invigorate his entire nervous system.I speak from the standpoint of a teacher of over six years' experience, when Iinsist to my pupils on the importance of aspiration to the highest during themarital embrace. Many a libertine stumbles upon this possibility of suppressionof the orgasm, and, with it, the suppression of the ejaculation of semen, andpractices it for awhile, only to find at last that he has wrought great harm tohis nervous system, and has, possibly, also enlarged his prostate gland. But thelibertine seeks mainly sensual gratification, and when he prolongs the act bysuppression of the orgasm, it is with the thought of increased sensual, bodilypleasure distinctly in his mind. He would be the last person to think of prayingto God at that moment, or seeking to enter into harmony with Nature, or tryingto turn his thoughts, during sex union, resolutely toward the Ultimate Force orthe Unconscious Energy of the universe. And so, being ignorant of thepsychological law which works upon his body during sex union, he fails toestablish healthy thought currents along his nerves. It is because the sexualorgasm is a mental, as well as a physical act, that it becomes so important atthat time to have the mentality well under control of the inward, spiritualself—that inward self which all deeply religious people feel to be a part ofGod. I therefore most earnestly urge the masculine reader, when he takes histhoughts away from the bodily sensation just before the last thrill comes whichprecedes ejaculation, to fix them, not upon something on the bodily plane, butto lift his thoughts to that which he considers the very highest and grandestpower in all the universe, call it by what name he will—First Cause, UnconsciousEnergy, Primordial Substance, Jehovah, Brahma, Allah, God, the Ultimate Force,the Divine.This is not religious cant; it is not goody-goody talk; least of all is it idlesentiment. So far as my observations go, it appears to be a psychological fact,that only in aspiration to oneness with the impulsive power of the universe,whether phrased poetically as \"Nature,\" or theologically as \"God,\" orscientifically as \"Ultimate Force,\" may the sexual orgasm be suppressed andfinally controlled without harm to the health in the long run.The first step—total suppression of the orgasm while it is still afar off—isquite easy, although it may seem difficult to the man who has never tried it.But he will speedily find, if he does take his thoughts away from the bodilysensation and aspire to the highest just before the last thrill comes whichprecedes ejaculation, that the tendency to ejaculate will subside. The erectionwill not subside immediately; and presently the movements may recommence.The second step—going gradually nearer and nearer to the verge, and encouragingthe orgasm, while he still suppresses the ejaculation of semen, and yet stoppingat the last moment without an orgasm—is much more difficult. But the experienceof mastery of the first step will help greatly in this. And let it be alwaysborne in mind that the second step is merely a half-way house on the road to thecontrolled orgasm and the sustained thrill. It should never be considered as anultimate act, but merely as a step in the training for selfmastery. Just inproportion as he masters this second step, will he be enabled to experience thecontrolled orgasm and the sustained thrill in a satisfactory manner. The secondstep is to be conquered in the same way as was the first step.In the third step he should pass through the orgasm without ejaculating thesemen, but with the full enjoyment of the final thrill, and in union with God,or Nature, or the Ultimate Force. It is to be mastered in the same way as werethe first and second steps.\"The intense pleasure of the orgasm,\" says Albert Chavannes of Knoxville,Tennessee, a writer on psychological subjects, \"is not, as is usually supposed,due to the ejection of the semen. While they are coincident, it is quitepossible for men to prevent, by the use of will force, the emission of semen atthe time of the orgasm. . . . The enjoyment of sexual intercourse is due to thegenerating of a current of sexual magnetism, created by a certain degree ofaffinity between the parties, and increased by friction. When this current hasbecome sufficiently strong, and a certain amount of magnetism has accumulatedaround the sexual organs, an overflow—orgasm—takes place, which, in obedience toinherited tendencies, sends a magnetic current to the testicles and causes adischarge of the seminal fluid. It is Nature's method to procure conception.\"> Magnetation is the application of the power which man possesses of controlling> this overflow, preventing it from taking its usual course and causing the> usual discharge, and compelling it to take another direction.

Uncontrolled, it goes to the testicles and causes an> emission. Controlled, it diffuses itself through the organism.230> [index_split_031.html#filepos708633] The cleaner the thought and the more aspiring the impulse which prompts a man toseek the sex union which culminates in what I call the third step, the moresatisfying to him physically, mentally and spiritually will this third step be.Those who seek only sensual pleasure therein are likely to be disappointed everytime. But those who resolutely lift their thoughts to the spiritual plane atthis time will experience thrills of physical rapture which they can experiencein no other way. I am sometimes asked by pupils who are church members, if requesting God to bethe third partner in the marital embrace be not sacrilegious. To such I reply asfollows:People who consecrate their lives to God, and then give him only the intellectand the heart, reserving the body for their own fleshy gratification, arefailing to keep their contract with the Almighty. \"The body is for the Lord, andthe Lord for the body,\" says the Apostle; and elsewhere, when he is exhortinghis readers to \"flee fornication,\" he asks, \"Know ye not that your body is atemple of the Holy Spirit which is in you, which ye have from God?\" In one ofthe two great commandments on which hang all the law and the prophets, we arecommanded: \"Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with allthy soul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy strength.\" How can a man obeythe Biblical command to love God with all his strength, if he fails to love Godduring the sexual embrace, and at least as strongly as he then loves his wife?At all events, a man need only live this doctrine for awhile, to know whether itbe good to follow or not. Even the feeblest aspirations of a sensual man, duringthe marital embrace, to the mere fringe of God's attributes of purity,tenderness, unselfishness, will be rewarded by God with an outgush of love whichthe man will feel in the remotest fiber of his physical body, as well asmentally and spiritually.The Hindus have a quaint superstition which is instructive at this point. TheHindu believes that the god whom he worships cannot experience bodily sensationsof any sort, unless his worshipper shares his own sensations with him.Therefore, when the Hindu is about to drink a glass of water, he pours out alibation on the ground, so that the god (poor thing!) may not go thirsty; andwhen he is about to eat, he likewise scatters morsels of food on the ground,that the poor god may not be hungry. And when he is about to go on a debauch, hemanages, in some symbolic way, to offer a share of his expected pleasure to thegod, after which he feels that the intended act has been consecrated and is allright.This superstition is probably a survival from an earlier teaching, such as Ihave set forth above, which may have been given, in the first place, to advancedinitiates by wise men, and afterward corrupted and carelessly bandied aboutamong the common people. There is at its core a beautiful suggestion—the thoughtthat Deity may perhaps experience personal pleasure when we share our ownenjoyment with Deity.Indeed, if we view the Primal Cause as God, we must surely hold that everything,even the capacity for personal enjoyment, emanates from God, and so he mustpossess the capacity to love us personally and to reciprocate our feelings ofgoodwill toward him.And from the Materialistic standpoint, it must certainly be admitted that, sinceeverything in the universe is a manifestation of an Ultimate Force (theimpulsive power of primordial matter), the capacity for personal enjoyment whichhuman beings possess must be somewhat seething or vibrating in the bosom of thatUltimate Force; in short, since a product cannot be greater than its cause, thecapacity for personal enjoyment and personal love must be an inherency of theUltimate Force of the universe, or it could not be so constantly sent forth tobe an attribute of human beings.Take it as you will—Personal God, Impersonal Spirit, or the Impulsive Power ofPrimordial Matter—there is no logical escape from the recognition of thepossibility of entering into personal relations of love and tenderness with theUltimate Force of the universe. And no man and woman who have once known what abeautiful and blessed thing it is to have that Ultimate Force as the thirdpartner in a sex union which is self-controlled and aspiring to the highestthroughout, will ever again wish to have a marital embrace from which personalrelations with that Ultimate Force are excluded.But those personal relations toward the Ultimate Force during the maritalembrace should not be entered on from base commercial motives—that is, with theidea of giving God so much and getting back an equivalent.If you are about to eat an apple, and a dear friend comes into the room, youinstinctively offer to share half of your apple with him, not because you thinkto yourself, \"If I give him this, I am going to get something from him inreturn,\" but because you like your friend so much that you want him to enjoy theapple with you. So should it be in offering God a third interest in your maritalpartnership. You should endeavor to make your offering to God with a feeling oftrue benevolence and good-will toward Him, a sincere, earnest wish to share withthe Deity whom you respect and whom you have every reason to love, a part ofyour most intense joy in life.If both husband and wife make this offering during the marital embrace, as theyshould, it practically amounts to returning to the universe a part of their ownpleasure for the good of the universe. It is depositing in the Bank of theUniverse a part of their own precious store of love and joy. And that bankalways returns such deposits with interest.I have spoken of the duty of the husband to practice self-control and aspi-ration to the highest throughout the act. It is also the duty of the wife. She,also, has her own three steps to master:> (1) Total suppression of her orgasm, when it is still afar off. This is to be> mastered in the same way as the man was directed to master his first step. > (2) To go gradually nearer and nearer the verge of her orgasm, and, just as> her vagina is about to take its spasmodic hold upon the male organ, to stop> resolutely, and refuse to allow that hold to be taken. This will doubtless> seem cruel at the time; but it must be remembered that it is merely a step in> the training for self-mastery. It is to be accomplished in the same way as was> the first step. > (3) To go right through the orgasm, allowing the vagina to close upon the male> organ. Keep self-controlled, serene, tranquil, and aspire to the highest. Pray> to God, if you believe in God and in prayer; if not, think steadily and> quietly what a beautiful thing it is to be at that moment in harmony with> Nature in her inmost workings, and rejoice that you and your husband are part> of Nature, pulsating with her, and according to her law. Rejoice that Nature> at that moment feels through you also, and through your husband. Feel love,> love, love, not only for your husband, but for the whole universe at that> moment. Remember that sex union between husband and wife is, according to the Bible, adivinely appointed ordinance (\"the twain shall be one flesh\"). And people whoconsider it impure are likely to reap little satisfaction in this third step. \"The pure in heart shall see God.\"While the man's ejaculation of semen should be totally suppressed, yet thereshould be, throughout the act, an oozing of fluid from the male organ, which isprobably intended as a lubricant, to assist it in effecting entrance easily, andalso to render it more sensitive.There should also be an emission from the woman, which acts as a lubricant, andwhich, mingling with the male fluid referred to, appears to form with it a sortof electro-chemical fluid which enables sexual magnetism to be interchanged withmore intensity to both parties. Without this emission from the woman, she islikely to experience comparatively little pleasure.For a wife to submit to genital union with her husband when she does not desireit, is to degrade herself so that she has no call to draw her garments asidefrom the harlot in the street. Indeed, the wife who allows her body to be usedas a convenience for her husband has degraded herself below even the harlot. Forthe harlot leases her body for ten minutes or for two hours or for a night, andshe is free to refuse embraces which displease her; but the wife leases her bodyfor a lifetime, and she mistakenly imagines that she dare not refuse any embraceof her husband's, however repulsive to her finer sensibilities. And so, year byyear, she coarsens and degrades the holy estate of matrimony, and paves the wayfor begetting children who shall be at least the children of a slave mother, ifnot also tainted with bestial propensities on the one hand, or, on the otherhand, impressed during the nine months of pregnancy with an unnatural loathingfor what was intended by Nature to be a pure and wholesome relation.A great mistake is made by wives in consenting to genital union without previouslovemaking on the husband's part. A man is always ready for sex union; a womanis not, although she may frequently be aroused by lovemaking. This is Nature'sindication that it is the woman, and not the man, who should indicate when unionis desirable; and also that lovemaking should precede all attempts at coition.Once in twenty-eight days Nature prepares a woman for creation; and themenstrual flow which manifests at that time is the outward indication of thecoming on of the creative mood. This creative mood may manifest in the longingto create a child; or in the creation of a poem or a picture, or plans for thespring house-cleaning; or in the designing of a new dress; or in the exchange ofcreative, magnetic strength with her husband. Whatever a woman especially caresto do, she can usually accomplish with effectiveness during her creative time.With most women, this time comes on the days immediately following the menses. Iknow of one exceptional case where it comes two weeks later; and of a few othercases where it comes just before. But, whatever the time in the month when thiscreative mood is on the woman, it is the time of all times to seek sex union.Married people who, in order to avoid conception, seek intercourse two weeksafter the menses, act most unwisely. In the first place, this method is not atall a sure preventive to conception, since a woman who is in a mood to desiresex union is in a mood to create a child. And, since it is not a surepreventive, women who do not desire to become pregnant are thus kept, from monthto month, in a state of mental torment which cannot fail to be harmful to thechild who may be accidentally conceived at that time. While, if the woman doesnot desire to have intercourse then, it is committing a rape on her to insistupon it.Although Nature's love-time is the period of the monthly creative mood for thewoman who has not reached the climacteric, yet, after change of life, the sexualfeelings and sexual attractiveness of a wife need not cease, if she have beenproperly trained in the exercise of her love nature. She can, if she wish,continue to be the beloved and desired wife, until far into old age. Ninon del'Enclos,231 [index_split_031.html#filepos708901] the famous French courtesan,was still sexually attractive on her 80th birthday.But for the woman who has not passed the childbearing age, her monthly love-timeis all important. And this time should be prepared for, on the husband's part,by days and days of tender lovemaking each month.It usually requires from twenty minutes to a half hour of affectionate caressesupon any given night, to arouse a woman to the point of desiring genitalcontact. If, at the end of a half hour of tender and reverent lovemaking, sheshows no signs of desiring genital union, her feelings should be respected.Comparatively few men realize that, while a man is a sexual animal, a woman isnot, but is a maternal animal. The normal woman desires to mother the man sheloves—to hold him in her arms, close to her bosom, and to caress him thus,without genital contact. She likes, also, to be held in her husband's arms; tobe caressed by him, and to exchange sexual magnetism with him on the affectionalplane, without genital contact. For there appears to be a secondary sexualcenter somewhere in the breast, near the heart, so that husband and wife may, inone another's arms, without genital contact, interchange sexual magnetism whichwill refresh, soothe and uplift. Men usually imagine, when a woman evincesdesire for affectionate caresses in her husband's arms, that she is ready forcontact at the genitals. Never was there a greater mistake. The woman cares, atthat moment, only for the interchange of innocent affection. And for a husbandto display unequivocal evidence of a desire for genital contact then does notattract her; it simply repels, and often disgusts her. It is, however, quitepossible that, if her husband behaved with consideration and self-control, andit were the right time in the month, she might eventually manifest a passionthat same night which would amply satisfy him. What she needs is to be graduallyaroused by the right sort of treatment. Husbands, like spoiled children, toooften miss the pleasure which might otherwise be theirs, by clamoring for it atthe wrong time.The man who thinks this prolonged courtship previous to the act of sex unionwearisome, has never given it a trial. It is the approaches to the maritalembrace, as well as the embrace itself, which constitute the charm of therelation between the sexes.One of these approaches—an approach too little practiced between husbands andwives—is the chastity of relation possible in a close embrace, in one another'sarms, night after night, with accompanying kisses and caresses, but with nogenital contact.Concerning this, one of my correspondents, a gentleman who is a highminded andearnest Christian worker, writes me as follows:> In the intimate affectionate converse of the married, far too little is> thought of the subtle and sympathetic influence of perfect contact, by which> the outward physical senses share and interpret the inward spiritual unity.> Too much insistence upon the . . . climax of union has thrown into the shade> the fine minor modes of loving expression. The truly married who realize the> infinite charm of being together—absolutely close, in loving union—resent the> suggestion of the interposition of apparel, as the lover would resent being> compelled to touch the lips of his adored through a veil or a Turkish yashmak.> True love tolerates nothing between. To those Christian husbands and wives who have come to shrink with horror fromthe thought of the human form divine, I would say they are violating the spiritof God's teachings, as set forth in the Bible. For, when God placed the firsthusband and wife in Eden, they were brought into each other's company \"naked andnot ashamed.\" Not until after they had sinned against God's ordinance, did theyview their nakedness as something to be ashamed of. And when God walked in thegarden in the cool of the day, and Adam hid himself, whimpering that he wasashamed to be seen because he was naked, God asked, scathingly, \"Who told theethou wast naked?\" Evidently, not God. In right marital living, the nude embrace comes to be respected more and more,and finally reverenced, as a pure and beautiful approach to that sacred momentwhen husband and wife shall melt into one another's genital embrace, so that thetwain shall be one flesh, and then, as of old, God will walk with the twain inthe garden of bliss \"in the cool of the day,\" when the heat of illregulatedpassion is no more.One thing which men do not always realize is, that the average woman comes tothe marriage bed far more ignorant of what is expected of her sexually than doesthe average man. For, even if a man has never had sexual experience with womenprevious to his wedding night, yet he usually knows, from the dreams of hisboyhood, pretty well what the sensations of sex contact are. Very few women,however, have amorous dreams previous to having sexual experience. And so, withthe first sensation of genital contact, whether it shock them so that theirparts become rigid and difficult to enter, or whether it come naturally andhealthfully after prolonged lovemaking, so that thrills of sexual magnetism willbe interchanged immediately on contact, it is in any event a startlingexperience to a woman. Now, women in civilized, Christian lands are universallyinoculated with the idea that it is immodest to show any liking for a man, and,very often, they carry this mistaken teaching into the intimacies of marriage.Too often, indeed, women think they have done their conjugal duty, if theysubmit passively to the conjugal embrace; and in some cases, they clinch theirhands as they force themselves to lie still, resolutely trying to resist anyanswering throb of passion during sex union. Poor, mistaken creatures! And thenthey wonder why the husband, after awhile, goes out to a harlot, who, at least,will pretend to the rapture which the wife thinks it immodest to show that shereally feels!A wife who behaves as Nature intended her to behave, will instinctively performpelvic movements during sex union. If she does not fall into the way naturally,she should consider it a solemn duty which she owes to herself and to herhusband, to try to perform them. If she will bear in mind that her love organs(the organs which contact) are given to her for the purpose, not merely ofreceiving pleasure, but also of conferring pleasure upon her husband's loveorgan, she will be better able to study out the sort of pelvic movements whichshe should perform. And she will soon learn that these movements can be dependedon to hasten her passion and to increase her lubricating emission, referred toabove.Let her also bear in mind that it is wrong for her to go through with thesepelvic movements for sensual enjoyment alone. Every throb of passion must bebrought under the control of the higher, inward self, and laid as an offering atthe feet of Deity, or blended, in thought, with the Ultimate Force, if she wouldhave the purest and sweetest satisfaction.Nature has so made a woman that it takes her from half an hour to an hour afterthe entrance of the male organ, to come to her orgasm. This is Nature'sindication that the man ought to wait for the woman, and not to hasten throughthe act, as is too frequently the case. A man who gets through in from three toten minutes after entrance, not only misses the most intense form of pleasure,but also fails to satisfy his wife properly. Her genitals being thus irritated,without being soothed by the discharge of her own sexual magnetism in exchangefor his, a congested condition of the internal parts is frequently set up, whichresults at length in her having to be placed under a physician's care. Many acase of lifelong and hopeless invalidism in a wife is traceable to the husband'shabit of hasty termination of the sexual act.If a husband wishes to treat his wife considerately, let him not hasten, eitherthe act itself or the approaches to the act. He should approach her gently,perhaps linger for awhile in contact with the outside only, enter slowly andwith self-control, rest tranquilly after entrance, and let his first movementsbe gentile and slow. In all things, let him seek, not to get the most pleasurepossible out of the relation for himself, but to give his wife the mostpleasure. Let him study his own movements, in their possibilities of conferringpleasure, and remember that these should be in the nature of caresses of herlove organs by his own love organ.To approach the woman's genitals with the finger for the purpose of excitation,is distinctly masturbative, and therefore wrong. The only lawful finger of loveat her genitals is his sexual love organ.Also, an orgasm which is induced mainly at the woman's clitoris is unwise. Theclitoris is a rudimentary male organ, with a similar power of erectility, thoughin a much lesser degree. To excite the woman at this organ chiefly, therefore(as is sometimes mistakenly done by quite estimable men), renders it impossiblefor her to exchange with the man her natural feminine magnetism, and the actbecomes more or less perverted, and destructive of her finer sensibilities. Theclitoris should play a very secondary part indeed, and the orgasm should beinduced within the vagina.Every marital embrace should be the occasion for the exchange of intellectualideas in conversation. Think and talk during the nude embrace, and also atintervals during the sexual embrace, of good books, pictures, statuary, music,sermons, plans for benefiting other people, noble deeds, spiritual aspirations.Do not speak of people against whom you cherish resentment, unless it be tothrow out feelings of love toward them. Do not tell indelicate stories. Do notchoose this time to worry over your household economies or business troubles.Shut out the world, with all its baseness, all its impurity, all its strugglesfor a livelihood, and let this be a time for the interchange of delicate, poeticsentiment, pure affection, playful, merry thought, and lofty religioussentiment. So strangely are human creatures constructed, that intellectualblending at this time is, by a psychological law, one of the most effectivemeans of welding the natures of husband and wife into a beautiful and perfectoneness.Not until the habit of self-control and aspiration to the highest throughout theembrace has been firmly fixed in the relations between the two, ought they startin to create a child.It is now well established that, if a man be drunk at the moment of impregnatinghis wife, or habitually drunk for some time previously, the resulting child iscertain to be mentally unbalanced, if not idiotic. This is because alcoholicintoxication has interfered with the coordination of his nervous ganglia.If intoxication at that moment, with the resulting failure to coordinate thenervous ganglia, be induced by other means, whether by drugs or by loss ofsexual self-control, is it not likely that the child will be similarly affectedfor ill?Of course, cases of children begotten by sexually intoxicated parents aredifficult to trace up; for sexual self-control may co-exist with the mostintense passion, while, on the other hand, a person of feeble sexuality maymanifest what little passion he or she does, in weak self-abandonment at themoment of impregnation. So that, at present, we can only reason by analogy whenwe say that, since alcoholic intoxication results in mentally unbalancedchildren, sexual intoxication is likely to produce similar results. But we doknow this: that a child begotten at a time when a husband and wife have returnedfrom a social gathering of friends, with their thoughts pervaded by genial andsunshiny memories, has, in more than one instance, been a child of sweet andserene disposition, in marked contrast to their other children.This instruction upon Right Marital Living would be incomplete, did I notmention one or two facts which an intending bride or bridegroom ought to know.One is, that the custom of brutal rupture of a woman's hymen upon the weddingnight, and, too often, the consequent tearing of the walls of the vagina, withattendant pain and loss of blood, is wholly unnecessary. The bride-elect shouldgo to a physician some little while previous to the wedding, and, if there be ahymen of any toughness, have it snipped by a pair of surgical scissors. Thiswill not be painful; and the hymen, which is a membrane attached to the walls ofthe orifice, will soon shrivel away, being now but a piece of dead skin. Itwould be advisable, however, for the woman to let her future husband know thatshe intends to do this, for the reason that there exists a popular superstition,to the effect that the presence of the hymen is a proof of virginity. On thecontrary, it is not a true test of virginity, for many women never had anyhymen, and others have lost theirs when children, by romping. Also, prostitutesare on record as having had a hymen which deceived physicians into thinking themvirgins. Nevertheless, because men still ignorantly hold to the popularsuperstition about they hymen, it is prudent for the bride-elect to state herintention ahead of time. Some men with brutal instincts feel themselvesdefrauded of their rights if the bride's hymen be not there, unbroken, for themto rupture. Of course, no intelligent, self-respecting woman would feel herselfbound to accord a husband such a right, if she knew beforehand all the pain andsuffering which the exercise of his supposed prerogative would involve. (I knowof one case where a bride was confined to bed for six weeks with abscesses inher vagina, because of her husband's brutal manner of effecting entrance on thewedding night.) And, if the bridegroom-elect be the sort of man who claims thisas his conjugal right, perhaps it would be as well for the bride to find it outbefore she marries him.But, of course, the natural instrument for effecting entrance is thebridegroom's organ of penetration, and, if at all possible, it should beemployed in preference to any other. Even where there is a fairly tough hymen,if the bridegroom will use gentleness, patience, and tender lovemaking, andrefrain from genital contact until the bride is thoroughly aroused, it willusually be found that she will, upon genital contact, instinctively bear down soquickly and effectively that the dreaded entrance will be all over within amoment. Allay the bleeding by the use of water as hot as can be borne.It should be the privilege of the woman, and not of the man, to choose betweenthese two methods.Another thing which often causes unnecessary suffering to the bride on thewedding night, is the smallness of her orifice, as compared with the husband'sorgan, especially if the latter be unusually large. Like a glove which is atrifle small in the fingers, however, this can be overcome by successiveattempts at entrance, provided these be gentle and slow, and provided, also,that the parts be anointed with some simple ointment, such as petrolatum,cosmoline or vaseline. Do not use an ointment containing unknown ingredients, asthere may be a harmful drug among them. Nature will, indeed, furnish a naturallubricant in the woman's own emission after awhile; but at first, it is well tohave the ointment at hand. Do not be in a hurry; be patient. In some cases, itmay take months for the parts to become fitted to each other; but the resultwill repay you. \"Patience and a little oil will do wonders,\" is a saying whichapplies here.While the natural position is for the woman to lie upon her back, and allow theman to be on top, yet, where the man is very heavy, or for other reasons, it issometimes better for the woman to mount the man. Again, there are various sidepositions, which different couples can find out for themselves, byexperimentation.As to how frequently genital union should take place, no hard and fast rule canbe laid down. The one safe guide is the after result to the husband and wife,mentally and physically. If the union take place according to the method hereset forth, and be not practiced intemperately, there should be no sense ofdepression at the close, nor should there be any feeling of nervous irritation;but on the contrary, both husband and wife should feel soothed and tranquilized.And the next day, they should feel serene and more than usually clear-headed;they should feel as though they walked on air, and as though the world were fullof brightness and joy.When either husband or wife is physically weary, or mentally fagged out, allgenital contact should be sedulously avoided. But the quiet embrace in oneanother's arms at such a time, without genital union, will be usually found tostrengthen and refresh, sometimes to such an extent, indeed, as to pave the wayfor genital contact a little later.In preparing for the creation of a child, let it be a matter for thoughtful,prudent, reverent deliberation long beforehand. Choose a suitable environmentfor the moment of impregnation, and do not attempt to create a child until bothof you have acquired the habit of self-control and aspiration to the highestduring the marital embrace, through repeated unions. Let the impregnation takeplace, not in the dark, but, if possible, in a warm, sunshiny room, in pure air.Prepare this room, as you would a temple for a sacred rite, by placing beautifulpictures and growing plants and statuary of an artistic order therein. If thelatter prove too expensive for your purse, you can get, from any Italianimage-vendor, cheap plaster of Paris statuettes which are copies of the world'smasterpieces. Do not overload the room with gewgaws and tidies and meaninglessbric-a-brac; let it be furnished with ideal simplicity. Set this room apart as asacred place for nine months, so that the pregnant mother may have a sanctuaryto which she can retire, at intervals in her daily household duties, to thinkthe thoughts of beauty, of purity, of serenity, of moral duty, of studiousintellectual work which she and the husband wish to impress with intensity uponthe brain of the embryo child. It is the right of every child to be conceivedand gestated in the very sweetest and sunniest and happiest environment that itsprospective parents can command.The parents, and especially the mother, can mold the coming child's tendenciesas they will, by the thoughts which they think at the moment of impregnation andfor some months before, and which the mother thinks with especial intensity orpersistency during the nine months of pregnancy. She can make of the comingchild an artist or a musician, a machinist or a preacher; she can give it apowerful bias to Roman Catholicism, to Protestantism, or to Freethought; she canmake it a student and lover of books, or an idle sports- man, or a dull,plodding nonentity; she can make it respect all that is chaste andself-controlled, or she can curse it with an irritability of temper or alasciviousness of ideas which it will take many long years of struggle on thatchild's part to eventually conquer. By dwelling in thought upon the perfectforms of the statuettes in her little temple of peace, she can do wonders towardendowing the coming child with a perfect form itself; by contemplating, dayafter day, the exquisite loveliness of a Mary Anderson,232[index_split_031.html#filepos709217] or the pure, spiritual face of someMadonna, or the clear-cut, sensuous features of some Greek youth, she may bestowupon her child the gift of a beautiful and expressive countenance, which may beworth more to it than uncounted gold, in after years.Such motherhood, coming as the consummation of months or years of repeated sexunions in self-control and aspiration to the highest, cannot fail in evolving achild who shall be well balanced, lovable, destined to success in life.It is sometimes objected that it is unwise to spread among married people theknowledge which is set forth in the foregoing pages, as they would straightwaycease to beget children, and so the human race would die out. This objectionshows how little the differences in the mental attitude of men and of womentoward the marriage relation are understood. The average woman longs, with allthe intensity of her nature, to have a child or children by the man whom sheloves, at some time in her life; but it is for her to choose the fitting time. Awoman who is made pregnant against her will, naturally resents the outrage.I claim for this method of Right Marital Living, that the quality of childrenborn from people who have lived in this way will (other things being equal) besuperior to that of children who are the result of accident or lust.Also, it has more than once happened that a married couple who have longed invain for years for a child, have eventually become happy parents, by reason ofconserving the male semen for the one creative purpose for which it is intendedby Nature, and allowing it to be expended only at long intervals, so as to givetime for the spermatozoa to come to full maturity and thus be potent forfatherhood.Another objection which is sometimes raised to the spread of this knowledge is,that if young unmarried people get to know of the possibility of controlling thefecundating power, seductions, promiscuity and illicit unions of all sorts willincrease. In reply, I would say that I find that the average libertine isunwilling to try this method, as he considers it \"too high for his purpose.\" Infact, a man who practices this method and who teaches it to the woman (as he isapt to do, in order to increase his own pleasure) will not be a libertine; forthe habit of aspiring to union with God (or with whatever else he recognizes asthe Ultimate Force of the universe) during the sexual act, and of encouragingthe woman to do so likewise, has the curious psychological effect of tending tomake him too loyal to that one woman to want to break with her. For this method,while it always satisfies, never satiates a man; and it renders the relation aperpetual honeymoon. On the other hand, should the man neglect to aspire to thehighest throughout the act, but keep in thought upon the sensual plane, theresult is likely to prove harmful to his nervous system, through the working ofthe psychological law upon which I have spoken at length, several pages back.Also, the union will be far less satisfactory. There are, therefore, twoinducements to any man who learns this method to rise above the merely sensualplane, and to aspire to the highest throughout the act: first, the increasedsatisfaction if he does, and, second, the dread of serious harm to his nervoussystem if he does not. And if he and his partner live this method, they willtend, with each successive union, to become more and more closely welded into apartnership which nothing could induce either of them to break. Thus theinstitution of marriage will be strengthened, not weakened, by the widespreadknowledge of this method of Right Marital Living.Image [images/00013.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"TAKE NOTICE Inasmuch as the United States postal authorities regard the careless mailing ofmarriage reform literature to unknown parties, however refined that literaturemay be, and however worthy the motive of the sender, as an indictable offense,because the unknown person to whom it is mailed may be a minor, Mrs. Craddockrequests that whoever sends for this book will, if personally unknown to her andif a business or professional person, write upon his printed letter-head, andsign his name to his letter; or, if he have no printed letter-head, that he willget some friend who has a business or professional letter-head to write on thatletter-head a signed statement that the person sending for this book is overtwenty-one years of age.

How shallwe chant thy praise?Of thy joys even the poets dare not sing, save in words that suggest but do notreveal. At thy threshold, the most daring of realistic novelists is fain topause, and, with farewells to the lovers who are entering thy portals, let fallthe curtain of silence betwixt them and the outside world forevermore.What art thou, oh, night of mystery and passion? Why shouldst thou be thusenshrouded in an impenetrable veil of secrecy? Are thy joys so pure, sodazzling, so ecstatic, that no outside mortal can look upon thy face and live?Or art thou a Veiled Prophet of Khorassan,233 and, under thy covering of silverlight, a fiend, a loathsome monster, a distorted and perverted semblance of whatthou dost profess thyself to the world?Whatsoever thou art, it were well, methinks, that the veil, for a moment, werelifted from thee, that the young and ignorant may see thee as thou art, and,seeing, be not misled by thy glamour to their own undoing, but keep the higherlaw when they shall have entered thy radiant doors.Image [images/00013.jpg]When the last stanzas of the wedding march have died away, and the bride, inshimmering white, places her hand in that of the bridegroom and pledges herselfto be his wife \"until death do part,\" a shiver of awe stirs the audience, as afield of wheat is stirred by a strong wind. An uncomfortable feeling pervades usall during these few moments, for it is felt to be a solemn occasion; and whenthe final words of the marriage service have been pronounced, every one feelsrelieved. Yet there is a more solemn moment to follow. It comes when the last kisses ofmother and girl-friends have been given, and the last grain of rice has beenthrown upon the newly wedded pair, and the last hack driver and hotel or railwayporter have been gotten rid of, and the key is turned in the bedroom door andthe blinds drawn, and the young girl, who has never been alone in a locked roomwith a man in all her life, suddenly finds herself, as though in a dream,delivered over by her own innocent and pure affection into the power of a man,to be used at his will and pleasure. She, who has never bared more than herthroat and shoulders and arms to the world, now finds that her whole body,especially those parts which she has all her life been taught it was immodest tofail to keep covered, are no longer to be her own private property; she mustshare their privacy with this man.Fortunate indeed is the bride whose lover at such a moment is a gentleman inevery fiber of his being.Image [images/00013.jpg]For there is a wrong way and there is a right way to pass the wedding night. In the majority of cases, no genital union at all should be attempted, or evensuggested, upon that night. To the average young girl, virtuously brought up,the experience of sharing her bedroom with a man is sufficient of a shock to herprevious maidenly habits, without adding to her nervousness by insisting uponthe close intimacies of genital contact. And, incredible as it may sound to theaverage man, she is usually altogether without the sexual experience which everyboy acquires in his dream-life. The average, typical girl does not have eroticdreams. In many cases, too, through the prudishness of parents—a prudishnesswhich is positively criminal—she is not even told beforehand that genital unionwill be required of her. I once talked with a young married woman, the daughterof a physician, well educated, and moving in cultured society, who had beenallowed to marry at the age of 20, in entire ignorance of this. She remarked tome: \"I think the relation of husband and wife is something horrid. I knew, ofcourse, before I married, that married people had children; but I supposed thatGod sent them babies, and that that was all there was about it. I was never toldabout the physical relation.\" Her husband was so lacking in self-control as tomake her pregnant on her wedding night.And her experience is but one out of thousands.In the ideal honeymoon, the bridegroom will not seek genital contact until thebride herself shows indications of desiring it. \"But she might never want it?\"My dear sir, you must be indeed lacking in manhood to be unable to arouse sexdesire in a bride who loves you with even a half-way sort of affection.\"How can this be done?\"Well, I think that the very first thing for you to bear in mind is that,inasmuch as Nature has so arranged sex that the man is always ready (as a rule)for intercourse, whereas the woman is not, it is most unwise for the man toprecipitate matters by exhibiting desire for genital contact when the woman isnot yet aroused. You should remember that that organ of which you are, justly,so proud, is not possessed by a woman, and that she is utterly ignorant of itsfunctions, practically, until she has experienced sexual contact; and that itis, to her who is not desirous of such contact, something of a monstrosity. Evenwhen a woman has already had pleasurable experience of genital contact, sherequires each time to be aroused amorously, before that organ, in its state ofactivity, can become attractive. For a man to exhibit, to even an experiencedwife, his organ ready for action when she herself is not amorously aroused, is,as a rule, not sexually attractive to her; on the contrary, it is often sexuallyrepulsive, and at times out and out disgusting to her. Every woman of experienceknows that, when she is ready, she can cause the man to become sexually activefast enough.If this be so with the wife who has had pleasurable experience in genitalcontact, how much more must the sight or touch of that apparent monstrosity in aman shock and terrify the inexperienced young bride!Yet, if you are patient and loverlike and gentlemanly and considerate and do notseek to unduly precipitate matters, you will find that Nature will herselfarrange the affair for you most delicately and beautifully. If you will firstthoroughly satisfy the primal passion of the woman, which is affectional andmaternal (for the typical woman mothers the man she loves), and if you will kissand caress her in a gentle, delicate and reverent way, especially at the throatand bosom, you will find that, little by little (perhaps not the first night northe second night, but eventually, as she grows accustomed to the strangeness ofthe intimacy), you will, by reflex action from the bosom to the genitals,successfully arouse within her a vague desire for the entwining of the lowerlimbs, with ever closer and closer contact, until you melt into one another'sembrace at the genitals in a perfectly natural and wholesome fashion; and youwill then find her genitals so well lubricated with an emission from her glandsof Bartholin, and, possibly, also from her vagina, that your gradual entrancecan be effected not only without pain to her, but with a rapture so exquisite toher, that she will be more ready to invite your entrance upon a future occasion.If the wedding day has been one of prolonged excitement, the most sensible thingthat the bride and bridegroom can do upon retiring, is to go straight to sleeplike two tired children. On waking in the morning, the first marital endearmentsmay suitably take place, and will be found conducive to the exchange of sexualmagnetism which will strengthen and refresh. Indeed, you should never, neverallow genital contact to be attempted when either of you is physically weary ormentally fagged out.If you are accustomed to the use of tobacco and alcoholic drinks, it is to behoped that you will have sufficient self-control and consideration for you brideto abstain from them at least upon your wedding night. Not only are their odors,especially when stale, disgusting to any woman of delicate sensibilities, butthe use of either or both will go far toward coarsening your emotional relationstoward her on that occasion.The effect of alcohol will be to lessen the co-ordination among your nervousganglia, accentuate your prominent weaknesses (this, too, at the very momentwhen you wish to appear especially manly in her eyes!) and inhibit your powersof self-control.The effect of tobacco always is to deteriorate the moral and emotionalsensibilities through its capacity for blunting sensation.Do you wish to be truly a man upon the wedding night? Then forego both tobaccoand alcohol upon that occasion and for a long time previously.Do not, upon any account, use the hand for the purpose of sexual excitation atthe bride's genitals. There is but one lawful finger of love with which toapproach her genitals, and this is the male organ. Even where there is a hymenwhose orifice requires to be gradually enlarged in order to effect a painlessentrance, the male organ, and not the finger, should be employed, lest amasturbative response be set up in the bride at the outset, which would be mostunfortunate.Bear in mind that the more gentle, slow and lingering your entrance, the morepassionate will be the response of the bride. Also, the more readily will youyourself attain to the sexual self-control inculcated in my Right MaritalLiving.As to the clitoris, this should be simply saluted, at most, in passing, andafterwards ignored as far as possible; for the reason that it is a rudimentarymale organ, and an orgasm aroused there evokes a rudimentary male magnetism inthe woman, which appears to pervert the act of intercourse, with the result ofsensualizing and coarsening the woman. Within the duller tract of the vagina,after a half-hour, or, still better, an hour of tender, gentle, self-restrainedcoition, the feminine, womanly, maternal sensibilities of the bride will bearoused, and the magnetism exchanged then will be healthful and satisfying toboth parties. A woman's orgasm is as important for her health as a man's is forhis. And the bridegroom who hastens through the act without giving the bride thenecessary half-hour or hour to come to her own climax, is not only actingselfishly; he is also sowing the seeds of future ill-health and permanentinvalidism in his wife.A woman's clitoris is sometimes hooded, which, of course, is an unnaturalcondition, and is apt to result in sexual coldness on her part, or, at best, ina stunted sex desire. Here a physician should be appealed to, as the clitoriscan be freed from its hood by circumcision; and the earlier that this is done ina girl's life the better for her health. Many a girl infant, it is nowmaintained by some physicians, is nervously deranged by the existence of such ahood, and would be restored to health by its circumcision.Some women have an abnormally long clitoris, which it is impossible not toengage during coition, and such women are usually sensual, and lacking in theability to prolong the act. In extreme cases the excision of such a clitoris maybe beneficial; but it would seem preferable to first employ the milder method ofsuggestive therapeutics, and for the wife to endeavor to turn her thoughts fromthe sensation induced at the clitoris to that induced within the vagina, whichis the natural and wholesome sensation to be aroused in a woman.Do not expend your seminal fluid at any time, unless both you and the bridedesire a child, and have reverently and deliberately prepared for its creationon that especial occasion. Your semen is not an excretion to be periodicallygotten rid of; it is a precious secretion, to be returned to the system for itsupbuilding in all that goes to emphasize your manhood. It is given to you byNature for the purpose of begetting a child; it is not given to you for sensualgratification; and unless deliberate creation be provided for by both of you, itshould never, never be expended. This, however, does not mean less pleasure, butmore pleasure than by the ordinary method of sex union. As to the details of howsuch sexual self-control may be exercised during coition, and without harm tothe nervous system, you can learn these from my pamphlet on Right Marital Living(price fifty cents).I would add that the habit of using a wife as a convenience for a man's easinghimself of a fluid which is looked on as an excretion, is chiefly responsiblefor the widespread idea that the sex relation is unclean, and for the growth ofComstockism, with its baneful efforts at suppression of all enlighteningliterature upon the details of coition as being \"obscene, lewd, lascivious.\" Thesex relation is indeed unclean, when made use of by a man for the purpose ofeasing himself of a supposed excretion; and the details of such a union aretruly \"obscene, lewd, and lascivious.\" No bridegroom of any delicacy ofsentiment will want to thus befoul his wedding night or his honeymoon. But whenthe higher law is known and kept—that of genital union in self-control andaspiration to the Divine—the sex relation at once becomes refined andspiritualized, and the morbid ideas about its being impure cease.When you are performing your movements, do not indulge in the thought of howmuch you are enjoying them; rather dwell, in thought, upon how much pleasure youare giving to your bride, and study carefully every movement with reference toits pleasure-producing effect upon her.Also, to the bride, I would say: Bear in mind that it is part of your wifelyduty to perform pelvic movements during the embrace, riding your husband's organgently, and, at times, passionately, with various movements, up and down,sideways, and with a semi-rotary movement, resembling the movement of the threadof a screw upon a screw. These movements will add greatly to your own passionand your own pleasure, but they should not be dwelt on in thought for thispurpose. They should be performed for the express purpose of conferring pleasureupon your husband, and you should carefully study the results of variousmovements, gently and tenderly performed, upon him.We human beings are so constituted that when we seek happiness for ourselves, iteludes our grasp. But when we seek to make other people happy, happiness comesand abides with us. If each will seek to give pleasure to his or her weddedpartner, the bliss of each will be greatly intensified. Especially will this beso if God be included in this pleasure-giving partnership, along the lines whichI have laid down in Right Marital Living.The custom of brutal rupture of a woman's hymen on the wedding night, and, toooften, the consequent tearing of the walls of the vagina, with attendant painand loss of blood, is wholly unnecessary. The bride-elect should go to aphysician some little while previous to the wedding, and, if there be a hymen ofany toughness, have it snipped by a pair of surgical scissors. This will not bepainful, and the hymen, which is a membrane attached to the walls of theorifice, will soon shrivel away, being now but a piece of dead skin. It would beadvisable, however, for the woman to let her future husband know that sheintends to do this, for the reason that there exists a popular superstition tothe effect that the presence of the hymen is a proof of virginity. On thecontrary, it is not a true test of virginity, for many women never had anyhymen, and others have lost theirs when children, by romping. Also, prostitutesare on record as having had a hymen which deceived physicians into thinking themvirgins. Nevertheless, because men still ignorantly hold to the popularsuperstition about the hymen, it is prudent for the bride elect to state herintention ahead of time. Some men with brutal instincts feel themselvesdefrauded of their rights if the bride's hymen be not there, unbroken, for themto rupture. Of course, no intelligent, self-respecting woman would feel herselfbound to accord a husband such a right, if she knew beforehand all the pain andsuffering which the exercise of his supposed prerogative would involve. (I knowof one case where a bride was confined to bed for six weeks with abscesses inher vagina, because of her husband's brutal manner of effecting entrance on thewedding night.) And if the bridegroom-elect be the sort of a man who claims thisas his conjugal right, perhaps it would be as well for the bride to find it outbefore she marries him.But, of course, the natural instrument for effecting entrance is thebridegroom's organ of penetration, and, if at all possible, it should beemployed in preference to any other. Even where there is a fairly tough hymen,if the bridegroom will use gentleness, patience, and tender love-making, andrefrain from genital contact until the bride is thoroughly aroused, it willusually be found that she will, upon genital contact, instinctively bear down soquickly and effectively that the dreaded entrance will be all over within amoment. Allay the bleeding by the use of water as hot as can be borne, dippingtherein a wad of clean absorbent cotton, squeezing it out, and placing the wadup between the lips of the bleeding orifice.It should be the privilege of the woman, and not of the man, to choose betweenthese two methods.Another thing which often causes unnecessary suffering to the bride at first isthe smallness of her orifice, as compared with the bridegroom's organ,especially if the latter be unusually large. Like a glove which is a triflesmall in the fingers, however, this disparity in size can be overcome bysuccessive attempts at entrance, provided these be gentle and slow, andprovided, also, that the parts be anointed with some simple ointment, such aspetrolatum, cosmoline, or vaseline. Do not use an ointment containing unknowningredients, as there may be a harmful drug among them. Nature will, indeed,furnish a natural lubricant in the woman's own emission after awhile, but atfirst it is well to have the ointment at hand. Do not be in a hurry; be patient.In some cases, it may take months for the parts to become fitted to one another,but the result is worth the trouble.Many and many a divorce dates its beginning to the ignorance or the lack ofconsideration shown by one party for the other in the nuptial chamber. And thosewho think to render marriage pure and holy by keeping our young people ignorantof the functions and proper management of their bodily organs, are the onesdirectly responsible for such divorces.The following out of the above directions is of especial importance where theorgans of the bride and bridegroom are so ill-matched as to make what is termed\"a matrimonial misfit.\" Sometimes the man's organ, which in a state of activityshould be about six inches in length, is much longer and proportionately large;and if the woman's orifice and vagina chance to be unusu- ally small, greatsuffering will result unless one party or the other has been cautioned and knowswhat to do. In a case where the organ had attained a phenomenal length, the manmarried a young woman of average proportions, and almost killed her upon thewedding night. Fortunately, the family physician, to whom the suffering bridereferred her case, insisted that the husband should wear a pad, made as a ring,which prevented the entrance of the organ beyond a certain distance; and thecouple are now living happily and have had several children. In other cases theman's organ is small, like a little boy's, so that entrance is an impossibility.Such a husband simply arouses and excites his wife, without being able to affordher the normal sexual satisfaction. Or, again, the organ, while of averagelength, may be slender, and the woman's orifice and vagina unusually large, sothat his organ does not completely fill it, and this also often fails to resultin full satisfaction to the woman. In the latter case the male organ cansometimes be enlarged by electrical treatment. But I think that where the organsof either party depart very greatly from the average size, the party who isabnormal in size one way or the other is committing a great wrong upon the otherparty not to give due notification of his or her abnormality in advance. Suchnotification, if given to the family physician, could be acted upon by him andadvice given which in many cases would greatly lessen the annoyance of thematrimonial misfit, and preserve both parties from making a wreck of theirlives.It is possible that much could be done by suggestive therapeutics to graduallyadapt the organs of such ill-matched couples to one another. Intelligent controlof the subconsciousness, and, through it, of the sympathetic nervous system, ata time when the sexual organs of both parties are excited and engorged withblood, ought to be able to effect very marked changes in the tissues of theseorgans.I here use the term \"suggestive therapeutics,\" because this is a term which doesnot jar upon the orthodox medical ear. But the method may also be called appliedpsychology, or mental science, or divine science, or yoga. The phraseologyadopted by these several schools of thought varies; so, also, does some of thephilosophy taught; but the scientific process is essentially the same in all.To the average uninstructed man or woman, there is no apparent relation betweenthe honeymoon and that philosophy which I prefer to call \"yoga.\" And yet, ifyoga were properly understood and practiced in the marital embrace by everynewly married couple, their sex life would be, from the start, so holy, sohealthy, so happy, that they would never care to descend to the methods commonlypracticed among married people today—methods which involve loss of sexualself-control, tigerish brutality, persistent rape of the wife's person, anduncleanness.The word \"yoga\" is a Sanskrit word which means \"union.\" It comes from the sameroot as our English word \"yoke,\" i.e., that which unites. It has been used forcenturies by Hindu occultists and metaphysicians, to signify the philosophywhich teaches mankind to enter into that state of oneness with the Divine whichwill secure them both spiritual bliss and power over their bodies and overmaterial things. To what a wonderful extent this yogic power can be carried isonly beginning to be dimly apprehended by us in America, here and there, amongstudents of the \"higher thought.\" But the Orientals have known of it forcenturies.\"Whosoever is born of God,\" writes the Apostle John, in the third chapter of hisfirst Epistle, \"doth not commit sin; for his seed remaineth in him; and hecannot sin, because he is born of God.\"Paul (I. Thess. 4) admonishes: \"This is the will of God, . . . that ye shouldabstain from fornication: That every one of you should know how to possess hisvessel in sanctification and honor; not in the lust of concupiscence {unlawfuldesire of carnal pleasure}, even as the Gentiles which know not God:. . . . ForGod hath not called us unto uncleanness, but unto holiness.\" In Genesis 6 wefind that Noah is especially praised because he was \"perfect in his generations;Noah walked with God\" (evidently, during coition).In my Right Marital Living, I emphasize the importance of thought union with theDivine, Central Force of the universe as the third partner during the sexualembrace. This is physiologically of importance because, without such union, itis impossible to fully control one's mentality or subconsciousness, and, throughthe mentality, the orgasm, which always begins on the mental plane, and which ispartly worked out on that plane; and if the orgasm be not fully controlled, itis dangerous to the man to attempt to suppress the ejaculation of semen at thismoment, as such suppression is apt to result in an enlarged prostate gland, orin damage to the nervous system in various ways.But there is another reason for union with the Divine during the act; it is thatone thereby enters into fuller harmony with the universe, giving and receivingsexual pleasure, in a way undreamt of without such union.Moreover, it is a duty—a courtesy, if one may use such a term in thisconnection—which we owe to that wonderful, all-pervading Force in whom we liveand move and have our being.Take, for instance, the case of a child to whom you give a box of bonbons. Ifthe child has been properly brought up, the first thing it will do, afterthanking you for the gift, will be to open the box and share the goodies withits little brothers and sisters, and its father and mother; then it will come toyou, the giver, and offer to share them with you, and insist, sweetly, that itwill enjoy them ever so much more if you will eat just one or two also. This isthe right thing, the courteous thing, the loving and altogether fitting thingfor a child to do on such an occasion.Now the Lord has given each one of us a box of delicious sexual bonbons, and,for my part, I think it is little enough that we can do, to offer to share oneor two of these bonbons with the Giver. It would seem, at least, common courtesyon our part to do so.\"But,\" you object, \"the Ultimate Force which we call God is impersonal, and doesnot experience sexual desires or passions.\"Indeed! Then, may I inquire, my friend, whence you received your own sexdesires? Do you suppose, for one moment, that there is any attribute of yourbeing which is not an inherency of the First Cause?Is there, indeed, anything in all the universe, even your own capacity forindividual, personal liking for a given man or woman, which can be conceived ofas not inherent in the First Cause?Therefore the First Cause, the Ultimate Force, impersonal though it be, must beinherently capable of sexual feeling and of individual personal attraction toany given creature.The Ultimate Force of the universe must, of necessity, be both masculine andfeminine in its inherencies. As masculine essence, it should be thought of asentering through the man's organ during the sexual embrace, giving pleasure andreceiving pleasure from the wife. As feminine essence, it should be thought ofas residing within the wife's body (the temple of the Holy Spirit) at the vaginaand uterus, riding the man's organ, giving pleasure and receiving pleasuretherefrom. Thus, the experience is shared with God in every possible way, and issanctified and glorified.Remember that Jesus said that the first and greatest commandment is to love Godwith all our soul and mind and heart, and with all our strength.No bridal couple who have once shared the joy of a controlled orgasm andsustained thrill with God will ever care to leave God out of the partnership infuture.The Oriental occultists claim that a prayer breathed at such a supreme moment ofself-controlled and rapturous union with Deity is sure to be granted. This isbecause such a process is a divinely ordained way of so displacing thepsycho-physical threshold of sensibility as to enter into the most perfectcommunion with the Spirit of God which is known to us earthly beings. When theinward self realizes its oneness with the Ultimate Force of the universe, itwill ask only for what it is right it should receive; and, as the DivineScientists insist, all power is ours, when we rise in thought to onenessinwardly with the Divine Central Force.Only that wedding night, only that honeymoon in which spiritual communion withthe Ultimate Force of the universe forms part and parcel of the sexual act, istruly blest.217 [index_split_028.html#filepos585702] Legendary 14th-century Swiss hero whoopened a breach in enemy lines by throwing himself upon their spears. 218 [index_split_028.html#filepos588276] Richard von Krafft-Ebing (1840–1902),an Austrian psychologist and sexologist, coined the terms \"sadism\" and\"masochism\".

In an 1895 diary entry,she wrote: \"I remembered having read that there are some savage tribes whoregularly circumcise the clitoris of the women--or, rather, cut it out.

"},{"pageContent":"> CHAPTER 5SACRIFICE By limiting herself to direct personal instruction, Ida had hoped to mollify thetwo most powerful forces that threatened to prevent her from sharing her messagewith the world: her mother and the law. At first, Lizzie Decker seemed satisfiedwith her daughter's compromise, but when Ida wanted to use the office at 1034Race Street to see her clients, her mother flatly refused, proclaiming that, aslong as she was alive, she would not allow her house to be used for teaching\"the slimy subject of sex.\"234 [index_split_035.html#filepos773838] Ida realizedthat she would eventually have to break completely with her mother in order toachieve her goals. In 1895, she wrote: > I know so well, from the experience of years, that as long as I stay anywhere> within Mother's jurisdiction, I shall be like a poodle at the end of a chain,> never knowing when I shall be hauled up short for some innocent excursion, and> liable to be switched off even from my expected pat at any corner of the road.> While I remain with mother, I shall never do anything; my life will be a> nonentity in the future as it has always been in the past. . . .

Her> prejudice seems to render her blind and deaf in advance to ideas to which she> would have gladly listened a few years ago. I am afraid it will end in my> having to go away from her for the sake of peace and freedom.235> [index_split_035.html#filepos774083] The first step was to obtain an office where she could see her clients withoutinterference. With help from her spirit guides, Ida found a room for rent onArch Street in Philadelphia that met all of her needs: at seven dollars a week,it was just affordable on her salary; it was within walking distance to her jobat City Hall; and the landlady was sympathetic to her teachings, being familiarwith the work of Alice Bunker Stockham. By August 1897, Ida had thus secured ameasure of independence, although, with her mother living only blocks away, shewas not entirely free of her influence. With renewed confidence, Ida also began to dispense some of her teachings tocarefully selected clients by mail. In so doing, however, she also tempted herother great nemesis: Postal Law 3893, the so-called \"Comstock Law\" thatprohibited the sending of \"obscene, lewd, and lascivious\" literature through themail. And it was not long before the law caught up with her. In the spring of1898 she was indicted by a U.S. District Court in Philadelphia for mailing threepamphlets: \"Letter to a Prospective Bride,\" \"Advice to a Bridegroom,\" and herexpanded \"Danse du Ventre.\" Ida suspected that the charges were actuallymotivated by her refusal to pay assessments to the Quay party,236[index_split_035.html#filepos774361] which were regularly collected from theemployees at City Hall. In any event, her mother struck a deal with U.S.District Attorney Jones: the case would be suspended if Ida promised not to mailthe pamphlets again. Reluctantly, feeling she had no choice, Ida agreed.But Mrs. Decker and D.A. Jones also struck a secret deal, in which Ida wouldavoid prosecution only by allowing herself to be admitted \"voluntarily\" forobservation to the Pennsylvania Hospital for the Insane, also known asKirkbride's Asylum.237 [index_split_035.html#filepos774718] Again feeling shehad no choice, she stayed a patient at the asylum for almost three months duringthe summer of 1898, diagnosed with nothing more specific than having \"a chronicform of mental trouble.\"238 [index_split_035.html#filepos775427] However, shewas not legally committed, or ever judged insane by any court. In September, shewas allowed to leave, the experience convincing her that she would rather sufferprison than ever to return.Worried that her mother might try to send her back to the asylum, she fled oncemore to London and the sanctuary offered by W. T. Stead. This time, however, herstay was short-lived. Mrs. Decker wrote to Stead, incensed by the fact that herdaughter had taken to calling herself \"Mrs. Craddock,\" thereby attempting tolegitimize her spirit marriage. It was all a lie, insisted her mother. Stead, ofcourse, knew better. Unfortunately, he was out of town when the letter arrived,and it was read by his wife instead. Mrs. Stead had not been let in on thesecret that Ida wasn't conventionally married, and was not as understandingabout the idea of spirit marriage as her husband was, so he had quite a bit ofexplaining to do when he returned to London. Although the Stead marriagesurvived the scandal, Ida did not feel comfortable remaining in London withthem. She set sail for New York on December 30, 1898.Once back in the U.S., she made her way to Chicago, being careful to avoidPennsylvania on the way, as her mother had hinted that she had \"parole papers\"she could use to have Ida committed to the asylum for good. She probably choseChicago because Alice Bunker Stockham was there; before leaving England, shetold her correspondents that mail could be sent to her in care of Stockham'saddress. Once established in Chicago, she rented a room on Dearborn Street thatserved as both her home and her office for seeing marital reform clients—her\"pupils,\" as she called them.Ida flourished in Chicago. It was here that she wrote Right Marital Living andThe Wedding Night, distributing them to her clients both in person and throughthe mail. Also, inspired by Vivekananda's Raja Yoga, which was sweeping thenation in popularity at the time, she established the Church of Yoga withherself as \"pastor and priestess.\" Not to be confused with the more physicaltype of yoga (hatha yoga) ubiquitous today in the form of workout videos andfitness studios, the raja or \"royal\" yoga embraced by Ida emphasized meditation,breathing exercises, and the attainment of advanced states of spiritualconsciousness. Its requisite discipline and selfcontrol nicely complemented herown teachings.While in Chicago, Ida also made contact with a mysterious \"Oriental teacher\"whom she described as a Persian Sun worshipper who had trained at the MazdaznanTemple of El-Kharman, in what is now Iran. This was Otoman Zar-AdhushtHanish,239 [index_split_035.html#filepos775714] founder of the Mazdaznan TempleAssociation, the first Zoroastrian religious organization established in theUnited States. Ida studied \"Mazdaznan breathing\" techniques under Hanish, whoalso had his own sexual teachings involving the prolongation of intercourse forspiritual purposes.240 [index_split_035.html#filepos775982]In May of 1899, the medical journal Chicago Clinic published an edited versionof Right Marital Living that generated much interest among its readership andresulted in orders for Ida's pamphlets to start pouring in from doctors all overthe country. It also attracted the attention of the postal authorities, whopromptly declared the issue un-mailable and began to investigate Ida once more.In October, she was indicted in U.S. District Court for sending copies of RightMarital Living through the mail in violation of the Comstock Law. She wasdefended by the famed attorney Clarence Darrow,241[index_split_035.html#filepos776383] who posted her $500 bond and convinced herto take a plea bargain in exchange for a three-month suspended jail sentence.Ida later described the incident in \"The Marriage Relation\":> Of course, there was no prospect of a fair trial; and as the United States> Court invariably stands for conviction upon such a charge, my lawyer very> prudently counseled me to allow him to effect a compromise; which was done.> The prosecution demanded, if they were to compromise, that I give up to be> burned, not only the Right Marital Living pamphlets, but also the other> three,242 [index_split_035.html#filepos776797] which were quite outside the> jurisdiction of the Court. As I was helpless before the Holy fathers of the> American Inquisition, there was nothing for me to do but to tamely submit to> this outrage, if I did not wish to go to trial and risk being sent to the> penitentiary.243 [index_split_035.html#filepos777082] Discouraged, especially by the loss of her stock of pamphlets which she hadstruggled to raise enough money to print, Ida moved to Denver in the summer of1900. There she was also able to pick up a few pupils, but mostly she lived aquiet existence, spending \"months of unremitting toil\" writing her magnum opus,\"The Marriage Relation,\" which encompassed all of her accumulated knowledge onsexual mysticism and marital reform, incorporating and elaborating upon many ofher previous works. The result was a dense 437-page typescript with chapters on \"Sex: The ChiefFactor of Civilization,\" \"The Religion of the Body,\" \"Unscientific andIrreligious Marriage: The Legal Prostitutes of the United States,\" \"The PhysicalSide of Marriage,\" \"The Metaphysical Side of Marriage,\" \"The Mother,\"\"Parenthood and Heredity,\" \"The Lover,\" and \"Our Young People: Their SexualLife.\" Its ambitious scope covered such diverse topics as sex in plants andanimals, methods of selecting the sex of a child at conception, venerealdiseases, hygiene, and dress reform. Included were all of the components thathad contributed to her philosophy: the Danse du Ventre, male continence, DivineScience, New Thought, magnetation, yoga, Mazdaznan breathing, and more.She also acknowledged it to be \"the most frank and explicit book on the detailsof the marriage relation that has ever been offered to the public.\"244[index_split_035.html#filepos777356] In it, she openly discusses such taboosubjects as masturbation, \"the French method\" (fellatio), and homosexuality (allof which she condemned), and earnestly advocates radically progressive positionson sex education for children and trial marriages for the young (involving sexbut no pregnancy, thanks to male continence). She knew, however, that it couldnot be published \"until such time as the public shows itself ready for it\"245[index_split_035.html#filepos777613] and so kept it under wraps.After sending off her latest draft of \"The Marriage Relation\" to W. T. Stead inLondon for safekeeping, Ida left Denver in the spring of 1901 and moved toWashington, DC, where she intended to stay for some time. This was not to be,however, as she was, in her own words, \"fired from the city.\" The authoritiesvery quickly caught on to her, tipped off by a secret informant. On April 24 shewas arrested and arraigned once more for mailing her pamphlets. This time,however, she was released without trial on the condition that she leave the cityat once.So she made her way directly and deliberately to Anthony Comstock's hometown,New York City. She was tired of the secret charges and judicial deals that,although they kept her out of jail, also prevented her from fulfilling hermission by suppressing her teachings from public view. She was eager to have herpersecution come out in the open so all could see what was being done to her. Ina letter to the Chicago Clinic, she wrote: \"I have an inward feeling that I amreally divinely led here to New York to face this wicked and depraved manComstock in open court and to strike the blow which shall start the overthrow ofComstockism.\" She would soon have her chance.In the meantime, she rented an office at 134 West 23rd Street for seven dollarsa week, where she also slept on blankets on the floor until she was eventuallyable to afford a chaise. She advertised her Church of Yoga and began seeingpupils again, and responded to a steadily increasing volume of correspondence,including more requests for The Wedding Night and Right Marital Living fromprofessionals and laypeople alike. Also during this time, she continued herstudies on behalf of W. T. Stead, producing two well-researched typescriptsentitled Lunar and Sex Worship and Sex Worship—Continued at his request and withhis financial support.246 [index_split_035.html#filepos777962] But all thewhile, she knew the clock was ticking a steady countdown toward her eventualshowdown with Comstock.Ida did not rush recklessly to meet her fate, however. She was careful to mailher pamphlets only to professionals who sent their requests on printedletterhead, giving her some measure of assurance that they would be usedresponsibly. This policy did not provide Comstock with any opening to nab herfor mailing the offending material to anyone who had actually requested it,since they did not make any complaints. So he tried another approach, employinga strategy that is still widely used to justify the prosecution of indecency inthe United States today: the \"harmful to minors\" ploy.247[index_split_035.html#filepos778241] On February 3, 1902, Comstock sent a decoyletter to Ida, in which he pretended to be a seventeen-year-old girl named\"Frankie Streeter\" and asked if she admitted young girls to her lectures. Healso enclosed fifty cents and asked her to mail him a copy of The Wedding Night.Ida did not take the bait. Instead, she wrote \"Frankie\" a long reply, returningher money and refusing to send her the pamphlet she requested. She also statedthat she had never knowingly admitted any minors to her lectures, due to \"asocial superstition that young people should be kept as ignorant as possible ofall that pertains to the marriage relation,\" and that because of thissuperstition, \"anybody who instructs a minor in these matters . . . can be dealtwith by law.\"248 [index_split_035.html#filepos778941] In fact, Ida had figuredout that it was Comstock who had sent the letter in an attempt to entrap her,and she sent a copy to her attorney just in case.Image [images/00017.jpg]> Figure 8. Decoy letter sent by Anthony Comstock to entrap Ida Craddock,> published in The Truth Seeker (New York), November 8, 1902, p.710. The fact that he had no evidence against her did not stop Comstock, however. Afew days later, he had her arrested for violating federal law by sending obsceneliterature through the mail.After making bail, Ida began to formulate plans for her defense. But withvindictive zeal, Comstock had her arrested again a few weeks later and chargedwith violating the New York state law against selling obscenity—taking theopportunity to prosecute her twice for the same crime.249[index_split_035.html#filepos779247] Due to a delay in securing the bond, shehad to spend a sleepless night in the city jail among drunkards and pettythieves before being released once again.This time, however, Ida would not go quietly. The weekly Freethought newspaper,The Truth Seeker, reported on her arrests, and her old friends E. B. Foote andHenrietta Westbrook provided steadfast support. Foote printed up a pamphletentitled \"Comstock Versus Craddock,\" giving details of her persecution andtestimony from doctors and clergymen lauding the value of her instruction. AndWestbrook offered to appear in court on her behalf, telling her that \"I havenever considered you insane. I never have considered anyone insane simplybecause they knew more about something than I do.\"250[index_split_035.html#filepos779690]Ida's state trial took place on Friday, March 14, 1902 before a Special Sessionscourt presided over by three judges in lieu of a jury. As expected, the judgeswere decidedly hostile, blocking testimony from doctors as to the educationalvalue of her pamphlets. Because she would not send him The Wedding Night inresponse to his decoy letter, Comstock claimed instead that he had receivedcomplaints alleging that Ida had given her pamphlets to two girls under sixteenyears of age; but he was not required to produce any witnesses or even the namesof his supposed informants. He also improperly attempted to bias the court bybringing up Ida's previous obscenity arrests. Meanwhile, Mrs. Decker tried toconvince her daughter's attorney to introduce an insanity defense, but herefused to do so without his client's permission. On Monday, March 17, thejudges sentenced Ida to three months in the city workhouse on Blackwell'sIsland, notorious for its harsh conditions. In pronouncing her sentence, one ofthe judges remarked: \"This is the most awful case that ever came into thiscourt. I have never before known of such indescribable filth. I cannot believethat this woman is in her right mind. No woman in her right mind, gentle bornand well educated, as the literary style of this book shows, could conceive suchfilthy phrases. She has caused just such trouble as this in Chicago, Washington,and Philadelphia before she came to this city. We consider her a danger to thepublic morals.\"251 [index_split_035.html#filepos779980]Ida was allowed to write only one letter per month from prison, scrawled inpencil on small scraps of paper. The knee-length skirts provided to the inmatesleft her legs bare, and in the cold she suffered from a chronic sore throat. Toadd insult to injury, she was twice forced to receive vaccinations against herwill. When she protested, she was informed that, as a prisoner, she had given upall of her civil rights, which greatly disturbed her. She was told that, if shecontinued to resist, she would be sent to the dreaded \"black room\" for solitaryconfinement and a diet of bread and water. About the incident, she wrote: \"Ihave been at a white heat of indignation over the two outrages inflicted on myperson by vaccination by this physician by force, first in the Tombs and thenhere. These two times are the only instances where a man has ever laid forciblehands on my person, & I have an outraged feeling within my soul, somewhat asthough I had been raped. Oh, it is dreadful!\"252[index_split_035.html#filepos780268]And yet she did not despair. Most of the content of her letters involvedplanning her defense in the upcoming federal trial, and making sure that therent and utilities continued to be paid on her office. It is clear that sheintended to continue the fight, and was hopeful that she might expose Comstock'slies in court. She was visited in prison by her lawyer, her mother, and herfriends, who provided her with care packages of food and medicine to help lifther spirits and treat her failing health. An appeal for clemency, sent byHenrietta Westbrook to the governor of New York, was acknowledged by his office,but not acted upon.She was released from prison on June 17, 1902, ill and exhausted, but undeterredfrom her mission. The Free Speech League sponsored a dinner in her honor at theClarendon Hotel on the 20th, at which many prominent luminaries of theFreethought movement, including her friend E. B. Foote, gave speeches of praiseand support. Ida was greatly touched by the reception she received, andexpressed hope that she would be vindi- cated at her next trial. And she pledgedto the assembled audience that she would continue to support their sharedstruggle for freedom.253 [index_split_035.html#filepos780550] For the next fourmonths, Ida stayed very busy responding to the outpouring of correspondence frompeople all over the country expressing their support and requesting copies ofher pamphlets.254 [index_split_035.html#filepos780825]Ida's trial in federal court took place on October 10, 1902, this time before ajury. However, once again, the trial was rigged against her from the beginning.The medical experts whom Ida had asked to appear as witnesses were not allowedto testify. The jury was not even allowed to see the offending material.Instead, the judge took it upon himself to declare that The Wedding Night wasobscene, and directed the jury to render their verdict based only on whether ithad been mailed, to which Ida had already admitted. The jury had no other choicebut to find her guilty, which they did without deliberation. Sentencing was setfor October 17, and Ida was released until then under a bond posted by herattorney.Faced with the certainty of an even harsher prison sentence, Ida put her affairsin order. She shipped the last of her diary entries and precious manuscripts toW. T. Stead in England, safely out of the reach of both the American authoritiesand her own mother, at either of whose hands they would certainly be destroyed.And she spent the night before her sentencing writing several letters, which shesent to her attorney, E. W. Chamberlain. On the 17th of October, which was to beher last day of freedom, she arranged to meet her mother for breakfast beforethe sentencing hearing, which was scheduled for 10 A.M. When Ida didn't show upat the restaurant, Mrs. Decker went to her room at 134 West 23rd Street to lookfor her. There she made a horrible discovery: Ida had committed suicide bydisconnecting the conduit from her stove and filling the room with natural gas.She had also slashed her right wrist with a razor, but the bleeding was notserious enough to have caused her death before she succumbed to the gas.255[index_split_035.html#filepos781148] Her body was stretched out on her chaiseand her belongings neatly packed into her traveling trunk, as if she werepreparing to go on a long journey. Only her trusty Remington typewriter, nowfinally silent, bore witness to her last recorded thoughts.Although it shocked and surprised everyone, her suicide was not a desperate actof despondency or capitulation, but a deliberate and wellconsidered act ofdefiance and martyrdom. Ida knew that her death would speak louder than anythingthat Comstock could say to claim victory in her case, and she made carefularrangements to ensure that she would have the last word, even notifying thepress that they would be receiving a letter from her attorney. Ida wrote twosuicide notes. One was personal, addressed to her mother, explaining that shehad chosen to take her own life rather than end up in either an asylum or prisonagain. The second was addressed to the public and clearly intended forpublication. In it, she was finally able to make her case to the world,unimpeded by any judge. The originals are not among her collected papers, butboth were printed by the Truth Seeker, from which they are here reproduced.That her suicide was not a hastily conceived reaction to the circumstances isborne out by the fact that she had previously considered the possibility thatshe might have to die for her beliefs. In her diary for December 6, 1896, notlong after the \"The Danse du Ventre\" was first censored by the Post Office, Idawrote prophetically:> Well, it is my last ditch. I don't care tuppence for my life now. I will lay> it down gladly for the cause of preaching right sexual living. But, when I lay> it down¸ I intend to do it in a way that will advertise widely the great wrong> to liberty which chokes my soul's freedom of speech.

But I cannot and I will not be silenced!> If not in life, then in death, this gospel shall be preached throughout the> world.> > As to what awaits me after death—whatever punishment may be mine for quitting> this world ahead of time, at least I shall be in a land where people think> purely about sex relations. That, of itself, would make almost any punishment> endurable, and would constitute Heaven for me. Ida's death was widely reported in the newspapers, from New York to Los Angeles,Atlanta, Chicago, and Washington. The New York World, which had first printedher \"Danse du Ventre\" letter, included her picture and quoted from her suicideletters. But the most outrage was expressed in the pages of the Truth Seeker,which carried both of the suicide letters, Comstock's original decoy letter andIda's response, and several articles and letters critical of the trial. Comstock, meanwhile, remained smug, insisting that Ida had furnished herteachings to minors and denying ever receiving her response to his decoy letter,charges refuted by her lawyer. But public sympathy favored Ida and turnedagainst Comstock. Chicago physician Juliet Severance256[index_split_035.html#filepos781445] wrote that \"Ida Craddock was a pure-minded,intelligent woman, working with a clean conscience for the good . . . ofhumanity.\"257 [index_split_035.html#filepos781857] The Washington Post notedthat \"she was a woman of culture.\" And a prominent New York clergyman, Rev. W.S. Rainsford,258 [index_split_035.html#filepos782135] publicly condemnedComstock for hounding her to death and called for his dismissal from the NewYork Society for the Suppression of Vice.259[index_split_035.html#filepos782453] A stung Comstock responded by threateningto sue Rainsford for libel, which did nothing to bolster his reputation in theeyes of the public.260 [index_split_035.html#filepos782710]Ida's suicide, and the public outcry it generated, marked the beginning of adecline in Anthony Comstock's power and influence. Although the NYSSV stood bytheir man, contributions to the society dropped off sharply after the episode.And in December, the U.S. government informed Comstock that they would no longerpay his witness fees or subsidize his travel, important sources of revenue forhim. The next year, he suffered a nervous breakdown and was forced into anextended convalescence. Although he eventually recovered, he was a shadow of hispreviously formidable self. He died in 1915 after unsuccessfully attempting toconvict Margaret Sanger261 [index_split_035.html#filepos782967] for promotingbirth control through the mail.Image [images/00018.jpg]> Figure 9.

York, May 12. 02, Monday Dear Dr. Foote: Referring further to the letter I sent you on Saturday secretly by a prisoner(and which I hope you got), I would say that that Board of Health physician, Dr.Richards, came again this mng. as he threatened he would, to re-vaccinate me;but it had begun to take (only slightly, however, I suspect). So he made no morecriminal assaults upon me. I asked him for a certificate of the vaccination; herefused this in the presence of Mrs. Keegan, one of the matrons, scolding, whenI grew indignant; \"See here Mrs. Craddock; when you become a convict, you loseyour civil rights.\" I replied that I am not a convict, as I am only in theWorkhouse; he replied that I am. Help me. Please ask Pentecost if it be really true that I lose my civil rights by beingsent to the Workhouse. When I told my fellow-prisoners that he said I am aconvict through being here, they were very indignant; they say that people aremerely sent here for misdemeanors.So please answer my letter of Saturday, if just a few lines. I have been at awhite heat of indignation over the two outrages inflicted on my person byvaccination by this physician by force, first in the Tombs and then here. Thesetwo times are the only instances where a man has ever laid forcible hands on myperson, & I have an outraged feeling within my soul, somewhat as though I hadbeen raped. Oh, it is dreadful!I enclose a letter to my mother; won't you please mail it to her, after readingit over? I have only two stamps left, which I obtained \"underground,\" so to say,& I am saving these for future emergencies. Any stamps sent in letters areconfiscated before letters are handed to us. I will make this stamp good to youwhen I come out. Mother's address is: Mrs. Lizze S. Decker, 1032 Race St.,Philadelphia, Penn. The \"check\" to which I refer in my letter to her is for myrent & gas bill. Chamberlain wrote her he would send her the two bills, but hasnot done so; & I fear he must be too ill to attend to them. If so, my rent untilMay 15th is still unpaid: ditto my gas bill; & this alarms me. I have beenanxiously looking for news from either you or Pentecost as to whether I shall orshall not be able to have my U.S. trial this June. So please let me know, one orthe other of you! It is dreadful to be a prisoner, unable to communicate openlywith one's friends. I want Mother to send you the check for my rent & gas, ifshe does not hear from Chamberlain; I do hope you won't find it too much bother.Gas office is, I think, \"New Amsterdam Co.\"; it is corner of 25th & 3rd Ave. Thelast two boxes of fruit contained some bananas, some of which were so rottenthat I had to throw several away, wholly or in part. I threw away three fromSaturday's box. Please get your grocer not to send me Zwiebach; I don't care forit; nor do I care for so many lemons. I'd rather have fewer lemons, & more ofsome other fruit. I'd like an occasional pound of dried California prunes,rather; & just 3 or 4 lemons a week. These prunes are only 12 (twelve) cents apound. I'd like occasionally—not every box—some sweet crackers or plain sweetlittle cakes, please, instead of Zwiebach. In replying, do not mention havingreceived either this or Saturday's letter, or it may be read, & I may get \"theblack cell,\" in foul air & among the cockroaches, on diet of bread & water.Eventfully yours, Ida C.

My dear, dearmother, oh, how sorry I am to hurt you, as I know this act will do. But, oh,mother, I cannot, I will not consent to go to the asylum, as you are evidentlyplanning to have me go. I know that this means a perpetual imprisonment all mylong life, unless I either recant my religious beliefs or else hypocriticallypretend to do so. I cannot bring myself to consent to any of these threealternatives. I maintain my right to die as I have lived, a free woman, notcowed into silence by any other human being. If, on the other hand, the prisonto which Judge Thomas evidently proposes to send me were to be my destined lot(you know very well that he wishes and means to lock me up for a long, longterm, which is practically my death warrant), my work is ended so far as thisworld is concerned. My books have been given a start, approved by physicians andother reputable citizens, but the world is not yet ready for all the beautifulteachings which I have to give it. Other people will take up my work, however,some day—will take it up where I laid it down, and will start from where I leftoff and do better work than they could have done but for me. Some day you'll beproud of me. You will understand that what I have done has been done because youand my father prepared me for just such a propaganda to humanity. You may askwhy I did not give it up and come home to live with you, resuming my name of\"Miss Craddock,\" and taking up other work. But, dear mother, I could be of nopossible help to you, with the shadow of reproach which bigots and impure-mindedpeople have put on me. I should be only a hindrance to your respectability.Moreover, my individuality has some rights. I cannot recant my beliefs and throwaside a principle for which I have toiled and struggled for nine years, even atthe behest of a mother that is dear to me. Do not grieve, dear, dear mother; the world beyond the grave, believe me, is farmore real and substantial than is this world in which we today live. This earthlife which the Hindus have for centuries termed \"Ma-ya-,\" that is illusion. Mypeople assure me that theirs is the real, the objective, the material world.Ours is the lopsided, the incomplete world. You and I shall meet in thatbeautiful world over there and shall know each other as individuals just asclearly as we do here, only more so. I do not know whether it will be possiblefor me to return to you; but if I can, I will do so. Only remember that you musttry to keep the five rules for clear thinking and correct living which my peoplehave given me. If I do come back, of this I feel sure. As you may have forgottenthese, I am going to give them here again: 1. Do your daily earthly duty undeterred by calls to mediumship from any source. 2. Be self-controlled and strive to be more amiable and loving every day. 3. Wait and watch for the highest. 4. Avoid selfish seeking of self-ease. 5. Abide in purity, not merely moral purity, but physical cleanliness; and still more, intellectual clearness—that is freedom from prejudice; think clearly.Love all people, even those who have wronged you, if you would receive clearcommunications from over the border. It is possible that I may come as I havesaid. I do not know. But in any event, it cannot be long before you will join meover here, and I shall be on hand to welcome you, dear, dear mother, when you docome. Oh, if only you could have brought yourself to have let me live at home to carryon my propaganda under your modifying advice, then this need never have been,and I could have lived for many years to carry on a moderate, far less crudelyradical propaganda than I have done. I have had nobody to stand by me and tohelp me; I have had to carve out my own road without any predecessors to guideme.You will find $40 in my trunk. I have written to Mr. Chamberlain tonight to tellyou just where I have placed it. I do not know who may read this letter beforeyou get it, and so have taken this precaution.Will you mind expressing the various books I addressed here tonight? As youknow, I have been unable to get out today to send them off as I hoped to do. Forthere is an Adams Express Company on this street, several doors this side ofFifth Avenue.Dear, dear mother, please remember that I love you, and that I shall always loveyou. Even if you get fantastic communications from the border land, rememberthat the real Ida is not going there.The real Ida, your own daughter, loves you and waits for you to come soon overto join her in the beautiful blessed world beyond the grave, where AnthonyComstocks and corrupt judges and impure-minded people are not known. We shall bevery happy together some day, you and I, dear mother; there will be a blessedreality for us both at last. I love you, dear mother; never forget that. Andlove cannot die; it is no dream, it is a reality. We shall be the individualsover there that we are here, only with enlarged capacities. Goodbye, dearmother, if only for a little while. I love you always. I shall never forget you,that would be impossible; nor could you ever forget me.

The book has been favorably reviewed by medical magazines of standing, and hasbeen approved by physicians of reputation. The Rev. Dr. Rainsford of this city,in two letters to me, partially approved this book so far as to say that if allyoung people were to read it, a great deal of misery, suffering, anddisappointment could be avoided, and that to have arrested me on account of it,as Mr. Comstock had done, was ridiculous. This little book, The Wedding Night,and its companion pamphlet, Right Marital Living, have been circulated withapproval among Social Purity women, members of the W.C.T.U., clergymen andreputable physicians; various physicians have ordered these books from me fortheir patients, or have sent their patients to me to procure them or to receiveeven fuller instruction orally; respectable married women have purchased themfrom me for their daughters, husbands for their wives, wives for husbands, youngwomen for their betrothed lovers. On all sides, these little pamphlets haveevoked from their readers commendation for their purity, their spiritualuplifting, their sound common sense in treating of healthful and happy relationsbetween husbands and wives.In contrast with this mass of testimony to their purity and usefulness, a paidinformer, who is making his living out of entering complaints against immoralbooks and pictures, has lodged complaint against one of my books as \"obscene,lewd, lascivious,\" and proposes to indict the other book later on, so as toinflict legal penalties on me a second time. This man, Anthony Comstock, who isunctuous with hypocrisy, pretends that I am placing these books in the hands ofminors, even little girls and boys, with a view to the debauchment of theirmorals. He has not, however, produced any young person thus far who has beeninjured through their perusal; nor has any parent or guardian come forward whoclaims even the likelihood of any young person's being injured by either ofthese books; nor has he even vouchsafed the addresses of any of the people fromwhom he states he has received complaints. In addition, he has deliberately liedabout the matter. He stated to Judge Thomas of the United States Circuit Court(secretly, not while in court), that I had even handed one of these books to thelittle daughter of the janitress of the building in which I have my office. Itso happens that there is no janitress in this building, nor is there any littlegirl connected with same. I took a paper around among the tenants to thiseffect, which they signed, and which I sent to the judge by my lawyer; also apaper to the same effect, which my landlord stood prepared to attest before anotary, if need be. But even this made no impression upon Judge Thomas; he stillis firmly convinced (so he says) that Anthony Comstock is a strictly truthfulman.On Friday last, October 10, I underwent what was supposed to be a fair andimpartial trial by jury; but which was really a most unfair trial, before athoroughly partisan judge, at the close of which he abolished my right of trialby jury on the main question at issue, namely the alleged obscenity of TheWedding Night book. My counsel was not permitted to present in evidencecirculars which showed that as far back as 1898 and 1899 I was accustomed tostate in print that any applicants for oral instruction upon marriage who wereunder 21 would have to produce written consent from a parent or a guardian. Myevidence was almost wholly choked off; neither my counsel nor myself waspermitted to endeavor to justify the book by argument. The most the judge woulddo was to permit me to read from various paragraphs in the book, withoutcomment, if these could explain the indicted paragraphs. Even with this tiny bitof a chance, I made such good use of my opportunity before the jury, that JudgeThomas, who was evidently prejudiced in advance against both myself and my book,saw that he dared not now risk the case to the jury, or he might not manage toconvict me after all. And so he announced that he himself intended to pass uponthe character of the book. He stated that there is in existence a decision ofthe United States Supreme Court which gives him this right.He said he would not let the question go to the jury; he considered the book\"obscene, lewd, lascivious, dirty.\" He added that he would submit to the juryonly the question of fact: Did the defendant mail the book? (The charge was\"mailing an obscene book.\") He said: \"Gentlemen of the Jury, the question foryou to pass upon is, Did the defendant mail the book? You know that she admitshaving mailed the book. Please render your verdict. I do not suppose you willcare to leave your seats.\" And the poor little cowed jury could do nothing butto meekly obey the behest of this unrighteous judge, and to pass in theirballots, \"Guilty of mailing the book.\" Which, of course, was no crime at all.I fully expected that the public press of New York City would duly chroniclethis most remarkable invasion of the rights of the people by such an abolishingof the trial by jury; but so far as I could learn, the press remained totallysilent.It is evident that the political pull of the party which fathers AnthonyComstock is too powerful for any newspaper in New York to dare to raise aprotest when, at the instigation of this ex officio informer, an innocent woman,engaged in a laudable work of sex reform, indorsed by reputable citizens, isarrested on false information and denied her right of trial by jury.Since Friday last, people of influence and respectability have written to thejudge on my behalf and have been to see him; but he announces his inflexibleintention of sending me to prison, and, he is careful to malignantly add, \"for along, long term.\" I am a \"very dangerous woman,\" he adds; Mr. Comstock has toldhim most shocking things about me—not in court, however, this paid informerbeing far too cute to dare to face his victim openly with any such lies.At my age (I was forty-five this last August) confinement under the rigors ofprison life would be equivalent to my death-warrant. The judge must surely knowthis; and since he is evidently determined to not only totally suppress my work,but to place me where only death can release me, I consider myself justified inchoosing for myself, as did Socrates, the manner of my death. I prefer to diecomfortably and peacefully, on my own little bed in my own room, instead of on aprison cot.I am making this statement to the public because I wish to call attention tosome of the salient features of Comstockism, in the hope that the public may beled to put down this growing menace to the liberties of the people.As I said not long since in the Boston Traveler, if the reading of impure booksand the gazing upon impure pictures does debauch and corrupt and pervert themind (and we know that it does), when we reflect that Anthony Comstock hashimself read perhaps more obscene books, and has gazed upon perhaps more lewdpictures than has any other one man in the United States, what are we to thinkof the probable state of Mr. Comstock's imagination today upon sexual matters?The man is a sex pervert; he is what physicians term a Sadist—namely a person inwhom the impulses of cruelty arise concurrently with the stirring of sexemotion. The Sadist finds keen delight in inflicting either physical cruelty ormental humiliation upon the source of that emotion. Also he may find pleasure ingloating over the possibilities to others. I believe that Mr. Comstock takespleasure in lugging in on all occasions a word picture (especially to a largeaudience) of the shocking possibilities of the corruption of the morals ofinnocent youth.This man serves two masters; he is employed and paid by the Society of theSuppression of Vice, but he secures from the United States Government anappointment as postal inspector without pay; so that he is able, if he wishes,to use his official position for the furtherance of the private ends of hissociety and, presumably of himself. Ex officio informers, with their attendantspies and decoys, have been throughout history notoriously a means of exploitingthe government for private and corrupt purposes.For over nine years I have been fighting, singlehanded and alone, againstComstockism. Time and time again I have been pushed to the wall, my books havebeen seized and burned, and I myself have been publicly stigmatized in the pressby Comstock and Comstockians as a purveyor of indecent literature. Yet this veryliterature has been all the while quietly circulating with approval among menand women of the utmost respectability and purity of life, and I have receivednumerous letters attesting its worth.Not only this. Comstockism can be used, as was the medieval Inquisition attimes, to gratify private malice, as the complainant does not need to appear incourt. This was done to me in Philadelphia because, while holding a pettyposition as amanuensis in the Bureau of Highways, I declined right along to paypolitical assessments to the Quay party. For months they tracked me night andday wherever I went, vainly hoping to learn something detrimental to mycharacter, and at last they arranged to have me indicted for mailing immoralliterature, as they could find no other means of successfully damaging myreputation.John Wanamaker once stated in a political speech that the Quay party wererelentless in hounding those who refused to pay political assessments. Theywould follow up such a person even when he went into the service of otheremployers, and leave no stone unturned to ruin him in after years. This may ornot be so in my own case; I do not know. But I do know that when I went toWashington a secret complaint was lodged with the police. My accuser never facedme openly in court. I pleaded my own case before the police judge, saved onebook (Right Marital Living) and won many encomiums from those present in courtbecause of the uplifting character of my plea; nevertheless I was driven fromthe city.Each time that I have been arrested, I have escaped by a compromise; but Iresolved, when I came to New York, that if again attacked by Comstockism, Iwould stand my ground and fight to the death. Perhaps it may be that in mydeath, more than in my life, the American people may be shocked intoinvestigating the dreadful state of affairs which permits that unctuous sexualhypocrite, Anthony Comstock, to wax fat and arrogant, and to trample upon theliberties of the people, invading, in my own case, both my right to freedom ofreligion and to freedom of the press. There is only one lawful excuse for thecommunity's interfering with anyone's religion or publication in America; andthat is, the invasion, by means of that religion or those publications, of otherpeople's rights to life, liberty, or the pursuit of happiness. No proof of suchinjury wrought has been produced in my case; the testimony for the governmentagainst me rests entirely upon the mere say-so of this paid informer.Every one of the paragraphs indicted in The Wedding Night is the outcome oftalks which I have had with distinguished physicians and also with men and womenamong my pupils. I have looked into the hearts of hundreds of men and womenduring the nine years in which I have been engaged in sex reform work, and mysoul burns within me when I see how husbands and wives are suffering, and hownearly all of this suffering could be done away with, if only Anthony Comstockwere not hoodwinking the public into believing that sexual information inprinted books must be kept away from them, so as to protect the morals ofinnocent youth. Surely, Mr. Comstock's idea of the nature of the marriagerelation must be singularly impure, when he ventures to pretend that it shouldnot be known of as to its details by young people who are sufficiently mature tobe seeking for enlightenment!In the courts, however, in obscene literature cases, a precedent has beenestablished by which the defendant is forbidden to produce witnesses in behalfof the accused book, so that I was legally prohibited from summoning physiciansto testify on behalf of the book.Owing to this and to other legal precedents which hamper the defendant inobscene literature cases as is done in no other criminal cases anywhere; owingalso the dense ignorance and prejudice which prevail in regard to thescientific, open discussion of sexual matters; and, most of all, owing to Mr.Comstock's persistent lies and to his adroitness in depicting the shockingpossibilities of corrupting the morals of innocent youth by permitting youngpeople to peruse any enlightening literature upon the details of normal,healthy, pure marital relations—matters have now reached the point where it isonly necessary to accuse a person of mailing so-called \"obscene\" literature inorder to convict him. As no witnesses are allowed to testify as to the effect ofthe book upon themselves or their young daughters or young sons, or, ifphysicians, upon their patients, neither judge nor jury are in a position tolearn the actual facts in the case. And now, in my own case the other day, thelegal precedent has been established by the action of Judge Thomas, in theUnited States Circuit Court, of not only excluding witnesses in behalf of theindicted book, but even forbidding either the defendant or her counsel toattempt to explain the reasons for printing the indicted paragraphs or in anyway seeking to justify, in an argument, the publication of the book; and thenfinally, by a legal subterfuge, abolishing the defendant's right of trail byjury; the latter being a proceeding which has always been recognized by truepatriots as a serious menace to the liberties of the people.In addition, in my own case, there is the matter of persecution for my religiousviews. Although this question did not directly arise before Judge Thomas, yet,from the paragraph which I read from my book, and which I was permitted to readonly without explanation, it must have been evident that the book contained areligious propaganda, and that, indeed, the religious teaching was the foremostmatter, the physical teachings being only subservient thereto.But in my trial under the New York state law last March, before three judges,the religious question did very decidedly arise. In that court, Judge McKean sofar forgot his oath of office (to administer justice impartially) as to hotlydenounce my book as \"blasphemous\" (presumably because I am teaching the duty andthe joy of communion with God in the marriage relation, so as to render itsacramental). Of course, this was illegal on his part. No judge has any right todenounce a prisoner because he differs with that prisoner in his religiousbelief.I earnestly hope that the American public will awaken to a sense of the dangerwhich threatens it from Comstockism, and that it will demand that Mr. Comstockshall no longer be permitted to suppress works on sexology. The American peoplehave a right to seek and to obtain knowledge upon right living in the marriagerelation, either orally or in print, without molestation by this paid informer,Anthony Comstock, or by anybody else.Dear fellow-citizens of America, for nine long years I have faced socialostracism, poverty, and the dangers of persecution by Anthony Comstock for yoursakes. I had a beautiful gospel of right living in the marriage relation, whichI wanted you to share with me. For your sakes, I have struggled along in theface of great odds; for your sakes I have come at last to the place where I mustlay down my life for you, either in prison or out of prison. Will you not dosomething for me now?Well, this is what I want the American public to do for me. Only one of mybooks, that on The Wedding Night, is at present under legal ban. Right MaritalLiving, which is by far the more important book of the two, and which containsthe gist of my teaching, has not yet been indicted. Mr. Comstock, however, toldme, when arresting me, that he expected to get both books indicted. Ifsufficient of a popular demand be made for this book, and especially if thatdemand voice itself in the public press, he will not dare to attack the book inthe courts. Will you do this one thing for me, those of you who have publicinfluence? Remember, it is for you and for your children that I have fought thisnine years' fight. And although I am going to a brighter and a happier land,nevertheless, I shall still look down upon you all here, and long and long andlong that you may know something of the radiantly happy and holy life which ispossible for every married couple who will practice these teachings. Even inParadise I cannot be as happy as I might, unless you share with me thisbeautiful knowledge.I beg of you, for your own sakes, and for the future happiness of the youngpeople who are dear to you, to protect my little book, Right Marital Living.I have still other teachings to follow this, upon the marriage relation, lateron. I have written a book of between 450 and 500 pages upon \"Marriage\" in whichmy teachings are set forth more fully. This book, in manuscript form, is atpresent stored in a safe place, in friendly hands. It will not be given to thepublic until such time as the public shows itself ready for it, and prepared toprotect this fuller and franker book from persecution. Meanwhile, however, RightMarital Living remains unindicted; it sets forth a gospel of marriage which isbeing preached by no other teacher in America. Its teachings will make yourmarried lives healthier, happier, holier. Will you publicly voice your demandfor this little book, Right Marital Living, and protect it from AnthonyComstock?Ida C.

"},{"pageContent":"EPILOGUE Ida Craddock's literary legacy would have faded into complete obscurity were itnot for the efforts of a New York free-speech lawyer, Theodore Schroeder. Theirspheres only just overlapped; Schroeder moved to New York in 1900 and foundedthe Free Speech League, which sponsored the reception for Ida upon her releasefrom prison, but he never met her in person. In 1913, however, he becameinterested in her case and began to research her life. He wrote to Ida's motherand to the asylum where she had briefly been a patient. He also tracked down herfriend Katie Wood, with whom he corresponded several times and met at leastonce. But most fortunately for us, he also made contact with W. T. Stead'swidow, Estelle, in London. She agreed to send all of Ida's diaries andmanuscripts, which had been in the possession of her late husband. The letters, diaries, typescripts, pamphlets, photographs, and clippings amassedby Schroeder form the bulk of the Ida Craddock collection at Southern IllinoisUniversity, Carbondale, where Schroeder's papers were deposited after his deathin 1953. The sheer volume of the material was doubtless daunting to him as hetried to decide how to make best use of it. He made at least two attempts at abiography, and took extensive notes toward a presentation of Ida's ideas thatwas to be entitled Metaphysics of Sex: The Philosophy of an Erotomaniac. But ofher original works, he only succeeded in publishing one, Heavenly Bridegrooms—first in serial form in the journal Alienist and Neurologist between 1915 and1917, then as a book in 1918 accompanied by a brief introduction.It is also through Schroeder that the value of Ida's works eventually becamerecognized by the leadership of Ordo Templi Orientis, whose distinct system ofsexual magic was being developed around the same time that she first articulatedher own mystical sexuality in Heavenly Bridegrooms. In 1919, Aleister Crowley,then the head of the British O.T.O. and soon to become its world leader,published a favorable review of Heavenly Bridegrooms in the Order's journal, TheEquinox. This is included as an appendix [index_split_037.html#filepos789225] tothe present work. The American branch of the O.T.O. has continued to support thepropagation of Ida's legacy, formally recognizing her contribution to theprinciples for which it stands by inducting her into its honorary Order of theEagle in 1999. The organization also maintains a website, www.idacraddock.org[http://www.idacraddock.org], which makes available electronic versions of hermost important works.Ida's influence can also be discerned in Louis Culling's book, Sex Magick.264 Infact, Culling borrowed heavily from Heavenly Bridegrooms to create histhree-degree system. The first two degrees, called \"Alphaism\" and \"Dianism,\"are, for the most part, identical to Ida's formulation. Although Culling brieflymentioned Ida in his introduction, he failed to credit her as a major source forhis ideas. Another work that bears the unattributed imprint of Ida's teachingsis Inner Studies: A Course of Twelve Lessons by the Zoroastrian guru OtomanZar-Adusht Hanish, of whom Ida was briefly a disciple in 1899.In addition to the specific influence of her writings, however, Ida must also berecognized for her pioneering contributions to the early history of the freespeech, women's rights, and sex education movements. She was neither the firstnor the last woman targeted by Comstock, but she was the first to outmaneuverhim successfully in the end and to turn the tide toward his eventual downfall.Later crusaders for the sexual rights of women, particularly their right tocontrol conception—women like Emma Goldman and Margaret Sanger—owe a debt toCraddock for paving the way with both her innovative clinical work and hercourageous publishing efforts. Although there are significant ideologicaldifferences between Ida's advocacy and that of later reformers, she deservescredit for challenging the status quo of 19th-century American sexualrepression, and paying the ultimate price for the cause of freedom.264 First published as A Manual of Sex Magick (St. Paul, MN: LlewellynPublications, 1971). Louis Turley Culling (1894–1973) was a senior member ofboth O.T.O. and C. F. Russell's magical order G.B.G. (\"Great Brotherhood of God\"or \"Gnostic Body of God\"). "},{"pageContent":"APPENDIX Although it attracted little attention in the mainstream press, HeavenlyBridegrooms did catch the eye of the famed British occultist Aleister Crowley.Crowley had been introduced via correspondence to Theodore Schroeder through theAmerican poet Harry Kemp.265 [index_split_038.html#filepos795662] When Crowleycame to America in 1914, one of the first things he did was to write Schroederand arrange a meeting. Crowley wanted Schroeder to organize public lectures forhim in America, and Schroeder was interested in Crowley's writings on sex andreligion. Crowley eventually sold him a copy of his Bagh-i-muattar: The ScentedGarden of Abdullah the Satirist of Shiraz (1910), and even offered Schroederaccess to proprietary O.T.O. documents on sexual mysticism if he would agree tojoin the Order and swear not to reveal its secrets. Schroeder never took him upon the offer. It was through Schroeder that Crowley became acquainted with the ideas of IdaCraddock, with whom he was unabashedly impressed. He wrote a glowing review ofHeavenly Bridegrooms for his occult periodical The Equinox. It is significantthat he signed the review as \"Baphomet,\" using his name as head of the O.T.O. inthe English-speaking world, thus implicitly affirming the relevance ofCraddock's work to the O.T.O.'s mysteries. (Crowley regularly wrote reviews inThe Equinox under several different names, depending on the subject.) One of hismost famous quotes also came from this review: \"When you have proved that God ismerely a name for the sex instinct, it appears to me not far to the perceptionthat the sex instinct is God.\"Crowley also took issue with the skepticism expressed by Schroeder in hisintroduction to the book, seeing no reason not to take Ida's claims at facevalue rather than assuming they were hallucinations. After all, Crowley was apracticing occultist who knew very well the power of the subconscious mind tocommunicate through visions and other mystical states. In one of his books ofmagical instruction, he wrote: \"In this book it is spoken of the Sephiroth andthe Paths; of Spirits and Conjurations; of Gods, Spheres, Planes, and many otherthings which may or may not exist. It is immaterial whether these exist or not.By doing certain things certain results will follow; students are most earnestlywarned against attributing objective reality or philosophic validity to any ofthem.\"266 [index_split_038.html#filepos796043] In other words, whether or notthe existence of a spirit guide or Borderland husband can be proven objectively,the important measure is the value of the experience to the mystic. In IdaCraddock's case, it is hoped that this book has provided sufficient basis forthe reader to judge."},{"pageContent":"ALEISTER CROWLEY'S REVIEW OF HEAVENLY BRIDEGROOMS 267> Heavenly Bridegrooms. By Theodore Schroeder and Ida Craddock.> Reprinted from The Alienist and Neurologist. This book has been left entirely unedited by Mr. Theodore Schroeder, with theexception of a very brief explanatory note. I may say that it is one of the mostremarkable human documents ever produced, and it should certainly find a regularpublisher in book form. The authoress of the MS. claims that she was the wife ofan angel. She expounds at the greatest length the philosophy connected with thisthesis. Her learning is enormous. She finds traces of similar beliefs in everycountry in the world, and (having a similar experience of her own) she canhardly be blamed for arguing that one thing confirms the other. Mr. Schroeder isquite logical in calling her paper An Unintentional Contribution to theErotogenic Interpretation of Religion, but commits the errors of petitioprincipii268 and non distributio medii269 with the most exquisite nonchalance.Only a lawyer could be so shameless. He begs the question with regard to thisparticular case, assuming that her relation with the angel was purehallucination, of which he has no evidence whatsoever. He argues that, since oneperson both loves and is religious, religion is nothing but a morbidmanifestation of the sexual instinct. One does not have even to disagree withhim to see how worthless is his reasoning. As a matter of fact, I do half agreewith him in my calmer moments in a general way, but the conclusion can becarried a step further. When you have proved that God is merely a name for thesex instinct, it appears to me not far to the perception that the sex instinctis God. This particular MS. is absolutely sane in every line. The fact that the womancommitted suicide twelve or fifteen years afterwards is no more against thesanity of the MS. than the suicide of Socrates proves that the Republic ismerely the lucubration of a lunatic. I am very far from agreeing with all thatthis most talented woman sets forth in her paper, but she certainly obtainedinitiated knowledge of extraordinary depth. She seems to have had access tocertain most concealed sanctuaries. I should personally be inclined to attributeher suicide rather to the vengeance of the guardians of those palaces than toany more obvious cause. She has put down statements in plain English which arepositively staggering. This book is of incalculable value to every student ofoccult matters.
