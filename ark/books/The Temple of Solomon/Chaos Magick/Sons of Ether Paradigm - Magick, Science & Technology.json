[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":" SONS OF ETHER PARADIGM: MAGICK, SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY, THE THREE KEYS By Wayne Myers and Billy Bishop "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Paradigm Through \"magick\" and \"science,\" \"technology\" is created. These three concepts make all reality possible. Within the MST system: Magick: Raw creativity. The building blocks of reality, also known as \"strands.\" Random Probability Creation (RPC). Humanity is the only known species to have demonstrated the use of magick. At this level, all things are ephemeral. Science: Through random interactions and changes, order came about. Science is this order. Science tends to guide Magick by channelling it, speeding it up, slowing it down, etc. Also known as Logical Composition Structure (LCS) Technology: Science \"uses\" Magick to create Technology. Technology is an end product. It is what Sleepers think of as Reality. The combination of RPC and LCS. Ascension Reality is a Robot, also known as Science. Each Divine Engineer (DE) wants to find a gateway to the Superfluous Flux, the source of Magick which lies outside the Robot. Once there, Divine Engineers will be to perfectly express their creativity and personal vision throughout their own cosmos and eternity as Robots themselves. Magick Engineering. This is not Magick in the MST3K sense. This is the working, manipulation and understanding of the Robot and its function. Paradox Electrotonus. In the act of channelling Magick, Science strips Magick of some of its probability. This probability is conserved and becomes, generally speaking, a destructive"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"by-product. DE's tend to accumulate Waste Product by their Science as well. Some of this conserved probability actually creates destructive entities as well. Spheres Applications; as above, these are applications of Magick, Science, and Technology. Correspondence: Crawl Space. This is a product of Science, though there are Technological implications. The Robot needs an internal means of finding and transporting items as well as allowing for self-maintenance and repair by DEs. Of course, maintenance requires the ability to see the problems that need troubleshooting, so the Crawl Space has many conveniently located View Ports and Observation Stations. Entropy: Malfunction. Probability in Technology naturally declines. The study of malfunctions involves understanding these breakdowns and how to reverse or speed them up. Forces: Electromagnetic Force (EMF) Technology requires power for non-Magickal change. Through Science, a DE can sense and utilize the Robot's internal power sources. Life: Automata. Living things are somewhat similar to the Robot. They have the capacity to use Magick and Science in varying degrees. Because of this, automata have more inherent probability than matter. Automata that are aligned with spirit tend to be more versitile than other automata. Matter: Structure. These are threads of relatively low probability. These can be manipulated to change their apparent form. By using Science, pure Magick can have enough probability removed from it to become Structure. Mind: Logic Gates. A DE may manipulate logic gates to optimize personal performance or to read or change the ongoing operation of logic gates in others. Eventually, the DE can travel the gates themselves. Prime: Magick. This has to do with the measurement of the amount of magick in a given thing or place and with changing that if desired. Spirit: Alogicals. This MST is not well understood. It defies nomal logical reasoning. Really efficient automata are noted as having alogicals. Alogicals seem to have a part of the Robot all to itself, though DE's may travel there with sufficient understanding, or perhaps lack of understanding. "},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Time: Trace Pattern. As Magick breaks down, it leaves behind minute amount of Waste Product. By measuring this, the DE may see how events took place in the past or predict how they will occur in the future. By increasing or decreasing this decay, time may seem to speed up or slow down, or even stop entirely. Arete FREES - Familiarity of Robot Electronic Engineering. Quintessence Flux. Magick leaks into the Robot from the Superflous Flux. As such, it has very high inherent probability which may be used in manipulation of the robot's systems. Mage Backgrounds Arcane: Baffling. Sometimes the Robot closes Logic Gates around a DE to protect him. Other times, the DE does this himself. Either way, others find it difficult to think about the DE. Avatar: Flux Capacitor. Superflous Flux sometimes leaks directly into the DE. This flux can be used in engineering. Destiny: Asymtotic Relay. Some DE's have greater system protection than others. When their probability of existence drops below an unacceptable level, the Relay protects them from achieving zero probability. However, this system has been known to break down or function ineffectively. Beware. Dream: Machine Insight. This gives increased, specific, and regretably temporary, knowledge of interactions within the robot. Node: Flux Node or Node. This place is where Superflous Flux leaks into the Robot. "}]
