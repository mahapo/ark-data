Lovecraft, 1936During the 1930’s, three American writers of fantasy and horrorfiction contributed to an interlinked, correlative catalogue ofwork, consisting of short stories and novelettes, which laterbecame known as the Cthulhu Mythos. These stories concernthe return to Earth, after millenia of absence, of certain trans-dimensional gods and entities, the Mythos taking its name fromthe central deity. The first, and most important of these writerswas Howard Philips Lovecraft, of Providence, Rhode Island.The second, more widely known for his tales of epic fantasyin exotic settings, was Robert Ervin Howard, of Cross Plains,Texas. The third, and equally fascinating writer, sculptor andpainter, was Clark Ashton Smith.Clark Ashton Smith was born on January 13, 1893, in LongValley, California. Like H.P Lovecraft, he could trace hisancestry back to New England and Europe - his mother’sfamily, the Gaylords, part of the Huguenot Gaillards, had fledto New England after the revocation of the Edict of Nantes."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Smith’s father, Timeus Smith, travelled extensively in earlylife, finally settling in the town of Auburn, California, wherehe was to remain until his death in December, 1937. And itwas here, on a 39 acre backwoods estate only six miles fromhis birthplace, that Clark Ashton Smith also lived and workedfor the greater part of his life, sharing a four-roomed woodencabin with his ageing parents.A highly sensitive child, Smith found school life unbearable1,and after five years his parents took him out of grammar school.From this time on, Smith was wholly self-educated, gaining acomprehensive mastery of English usage, as well as enoughof French and Spanish to compose verse in these languages.He began writing in earnest at the comparatively early age ofeleven, and by 1910 he was selling his stories to such magazinesas The Black Cat and The Overland Monthly.However, it was for his poetry that he initially received publicattention and acclaim - his first collected volume, The StarTreader and other Poems appeared two years later. This volumewas greeted with front page reviews in the San Franciscanpress, who hailed Smith as “the Boy Genius of the Sierras”and “the Keats of the Pacific Coast”. In 1918, the prestigiousBook Club of California published a second collection - adeluxe edition of Odes and Sonnets, with an introduction bySmith’s close friend and mentor George Sterling. In these earlydays, Smith moved freely in the artistic and bohemian circlesof San Francisco, which at this time included such literaryfigures as Jack London, Ambrose Bierce and DashiellHammett.By 1922, however, interest in Smith’s poetry was beginningto wane, and his next publication, Ebony and Crystal wasissued privately, financed by Smith himself. Lovecraftdescribed the long poem “The Hashish Eater”, contained in"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"this volume, as the “greatest imaginative orgy in Englishliterature.” Smith was greatly influenced by his favourites ofthis period - the works of Poe, William Beckford’s Vathek,and Sir Walter Scott’s tales of the Arabian Nights - which lefta permanent impression on his own elaborate and lyrical style.It is important to remember though, that it was Lovecraft, incorrespondence to Smith dating from August 1922, who firsturged him to begin experimenting with the newly-popularhorror fiction genre. (Lovecraft was later to send samples ofSmith’s writing to Edwin Baird, editor of “Weird Tales”, andsuggest that he contact Smith with regard to publishing hisstories.)Over the next decade, Smith contributed to over fiftymagazines, including “The Yale Review”, “The LondonMercury”, “Asia”, “Wings”, and “The Philippine Magazine”.His translations from Baudelaire (another important influence)were included in an anthology of The Flowers of Evil publishedby the Limited Editions Club. But it was not until May 1930,with the publication in “Weird Tales” (an American pulpmagazine specialising in horror and supernatural fiction) of anarrative entitled paradoxically “The End of the Story”, thatSmith embarked upon what was to be a major contribution tothe literature of the fantastic. From that date until 1934, whenhe virtually stopped writing, he produced over 100 short stories,mostly for magazines such as “Weird Tales”, “Strange Tales”and “Wonder Stories”, and “Stirring Science Stories”. The bestof these were anthologised as The Double Shadow and OtherFantasies (1933), Out of Space and Time (1942), Lost Worlds(1944), Genius Loci and other Tales (1948), and TheAbominations of Yondo (1960). He also started and abandoned,two novels.Fritz Leiber, another contributor to the Cthulhu Mythos, hascompared Smith’s stories to “Innsmouth Jewellery; like strange"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"ornaments, the metal elaborately inlaid and fired, studded withunknown semi-precious stones, from an unknown and timelessculture.” Certainly, one of the strongest characteristics ofSmith’s prose is its sheer over-abundance of outré detail andoccurrence, almost a kind of descriptive excess. (This verbalextravagance is at its most extreme in his science-fiction andscience-fantasy pieces.) However, another aspect soon becomesapparent to the reader, the dry humour and irony whichunderlies many of his stories. To a degree, these qualities helpto offset or counterbalance some of his more acute deviationsinto purple prose.The majority of Smith’s tales of cosmic horror take place inlocales far removed from the mundane world - in otherdimensions, on other worlds, in the distant past or far future.Certain groups of stories are linked by a common imaginarysetting - “Hyperborea”, the mythical northern continent,claimed by Madame Blavatsky to have been the earliestterrestrial civilisation; “Zothique”, a land at the very end ofEarth’s life-span; or “Xiccarph”, a distant planet teeming withexotic flora and fauna. Another story-cycle is set in theimaginary medieval kingdom of Averoigne. His strongestnarratives, however, take place in Smith’s own neighbourhoodsof San Francisco and Auburn. Against these commonplaceeveryday backgrounds, his trans-dimensional horrors seem allthe more effective.Though Clark Ashton Smith was undoubtedly influenced inhis poetry by the English Pre-Raphaelite and French Symbolistpoets, it was the work of the New England writer H.P. Lovecraftwhich was to prove the single most important influence on hisfantasy fiction. Of the contemporary writers who contributedto Lovecraft’s Cthulhu Mythos, Smith was the most prolific,encouraged by Lovecraft himself. Lovecraft welcomed theadditions to the cosmology of the Old Ones, and incorporated"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"them into his own works in progress. To the original pantheonof deities (Cthulhu, Yog-Sothoth, Dagon, Hastur, Nyarlathotepand Shub-Niggurath), Smith contributed such entities as “theblack and amorphous god Tsathoggua”; the spider-god “Atlach-Nacha”, and the primal deity, “Ubbo-Sathla”. To the Mythoslist of infamous and forbidden grimoires - the “Necronomicon”,“Unausrechlichen Kulten” and “Cultes des Goules”, he added“The Book of Eibon, a collection of dark and baleful myths,of liturgies and incantations both evil and esoteric.”Less superficially, Smith was able to imbue his mythos taleswith a sense of the vast epochs of time, the strange eons throughwhich the Old Ones have slumbered, awaiting the time whenthe stars are right, and they will again rule the earth. In “Ubbo-Sathla”, a modern day occultist discovers a magical crystalthrough which he regresses, via past incarnations and atavisticreversions, to the protoplasmic souce of all terrestrial life. In aquotation from the ‘Book of Eibon, Smith describes this entityin a phrase very reminiscent of Lovecraft’s ‘Old Ones -“...For Ubbo-Sathla is the source and the end. Before thecoming of Zhothaqquah or Yok-Zothoth or Kthulhut fromthe stars, Ubbo-Sathla dwelt in the steaming fens of thenew-made Earth.”In “The Return of the Sorcerer”, a young scholar is hired bya wealthy recluse living in Oakland, California, to translatepassages from the “Necronomicon” - Smith includes withinthe text of the story a passage from the most famous ofLovecraftian grimoires. His next piece in print, “The Tale ofSatampra Zeiros” (published in the November 1931 issue of‘Weird Tales’), contains the first reference to the god“Tsathoqqua”. Lovecraft had incorporated this deity into his"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"own story, “The Whisperer in Darkness”, in the followingpassage;“Its from N’Kai that frightful Tsathoggua came - theamorphous toad-like god-creature mentioned in therPnakotic Manuscripts and the Necronomicon and theCommorian myth-cycle of Klarkash-Ton.”“Klarkash-Ton” is of course a reference to Smith himself -the “Commorion myth-cycle” refers to his series of stories setin Hyperborea. As “The Tale of Satampra Zeiros” waspublished two months after Lovecraft’s story, it would appearthat Smith had shown Lovecraft a copy of the manuscriptsometime before 1931.Another tale in the same sequence, “The Door to Saturn”,introduced the Hyperborean wizard, “Eibon”, as well aspresenting more information concerning Tsagthoggua, namingthe beings which spawned him, and the planet (Saturn) fromwhich he descended to the Earth. “The Nameless Offspring”,published only a few months later in Strange Tales, beginswith another long quotation from the “Necronomicon of AbdulAlhazred”;“Many and multiform are the dim horrors of the Earth,infesting her ways from the prime. They sleep beneath thesea and in subterranean places...”This piece clearly shows Smiths deepening interest andinvolvement with the basic themes of the Cthulhu Mythos.Though only eight of Smiths stories2 can strictly be classed asbeloging to the Cthulhu Mythos, if the usual criteria of theinclusion of related god-names, locations and grimoires are"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"applied, others certainly share the atmosphere and structure ofthe typical mythos tales. Such stories include “Genius Loci”,“The Treader of the Dust”, “The Seed from the Sepulchre”,and “The Devotee of Evil” - there would seem to be a goodcase for their inclusion in the mythos on purely stylisticgrounds.Many of Smith’s plots also echo those found in Lovecraft’sfiction - for example, “The Hunters from Beyond”, which bearsa close resemblance to Lovecraft’s story, “Pickman’s Model”.In both, an artist’s representation of sub-human monsters arerevealed to be taken ‘from life. The theme of this story mayalso in a sense be symbolic., for Smith was himself a prolificvisual artist, producing a huge number of paintings, drawingsand sculptures, many of subjects which parallel his writtenwork. His colour paintings of bizarre vegetation and fungidepict landscapes from his imaginary worlds, Hyperborea andAtlantis. He also illustrated scenes from his own stories, andthose of Lovecraft,3 executed in watercolor and crayons.Though these images are stylistically rather crude, they havean underlying primitive power, and have been favourablycompared to the paintings of the symbolist, Odilon Redon,particularly with regard to Redon’s later colour work. In hismemoir of Clark Ashton Smith, E. Hoffman Price describeshis first viewing of Smith pictures:“Pencil - crayon - watercolour - many, pen drawn, withinks of diverse colours, these being done in laboriouslyminute detail. Some were two-dimensional equivalents ofhis sculptures. Other were ornate and highly stylizedrepresentations of plant life which appeared to be mergingwith the animal kingdom.”"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Of greater interest perhaps are Smith’s miniature sculpturespieces, mostly small enough to be held in one hand. Amongstthese are subjects from the Mythos, as suggested by titles suchas ‘Cthulhu’, ‘Dagon’, ‘Tsathoggua’, ‘The Outsider, andHastur’; others are bizarre heads like those of Easter Island.These pieces, often carved from the rare and unusual stonesfound in the California foothills, evoke comparison with certainforms of pre-Columbian and Polynesian artefacts. Concerningthese sculptures (which Smith fired in his kitchen stove) Pricerecalls:“many were android: subhuman, quasi-human,superhuman -comfortably gross- acutely devilish - stupidlycomfortable -sinister - malicious - full figures - busts - mereheads...”Unlike Lovecraft, who was a conspicuously introverted andself-effacing individual, Smith also worked at a variety of non-literary occupations - as a fruit-picker, lumberjack, digger ofwells, gardener and hard-rock miner - and seems to haveenjoyed a robust, outdoor existence. These part-time jobs alsoallowed him to produce highly individual stories without theneed to consider their commercial potential, as he never hadto rely soely upon the revenue from his literary and artisticendeavours. Smith also had a liking for strong liquor - againin marked contrast to Lovecraft’s apparent abstinence.In the spring of 1934, for no apparent reason, Smith’s copiousoutput of stories came to an abrupt end. From this time untilhis death in 1961, he produced only a handful of tales, despitethe fact that he had become one of the most prolific and popularof the “Weird Tales” writers, and was at the height of hiscreative powers. It seems as if the informative current which"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"had found its outlet in Smith fantasy fiction had been cut offor withdrawn. This is all the more remarkable when consideredin parallel to Lovecraft’s career - he also stopped writing shortlyafter this time, and died within a year and a half of completinghis last story.In the same way as an Occult lodge may be established inorder to transmit a particular magical current over a particularperiod of time (perhaps determined by astrologicalconsiderations), it appears that the ‘Lovecraft Circle’ of writers4provided, in the late Twenties and early Thirties, a focal pointor ‘receiver’ for the elements of the Mythos. The fact that thisprocess was largely a subconscious one, merely demonstratesthat is is when the imagination is operating most strongly, andhelping to block’ the rational, conscious mind, that thetransmissions of ‘magical’ knowledge is likely to occur. In thewords of Clark Ashton Smith (from a letter to Lovecraft):“My own standpoint is that there is absolutely nojustification for literature unless it serves to release theimagination from the bonds of everyday life.”“The Devotee of Evil” (1933) presents, through the char actorJean Averaud, Smith’s intuitive speculations concerning thenature of the ‘Power of Evil’, which he delineates in thefollowing passage“...I do not think that the power is personal, in the senseof what we know as personality. A Satan? No. What Iconceive is a sort of dark vibration, the radiation of a blacksun, of a center of a malignant eons - a radiation that canpenetrate like any other ray - and perhaps more deeply.’"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"‘For a long time past, my life-work has been to ascertainits true nature, and to trace it to its fountain-head. I amsure that somewhere in space there is a center from whichall evil emanates.”These statements are remarkable in that they foreshadow soprecisely certain esoteric doctrines revealed by Kenneth Grantin his “Typhonian Trilogy” and other books. (These includesuch concepts as ‘the Black Sun’, ‘the Kali Yuga’, transplutonicpower-zones, and the influx of magickal energies from thestar Sirius.). In Cults of the Shadow (1975), Grant himself refersto Clark Ashton Smith as ‘one of the major visual interpretersof the Cthulhu Mythos’, and goes on to state that ‘It is claimedby the Lovecraftian Coven that Smith is working with LesOphites - a sect of the Black Snake Cult - from the ‘otherside’.In July, 1953, Smith was asked what he considered to be hisown contribution to the Mythos. He replied:“I believe I added about as much to the Cthulhu Mythosas I borrowed - Tsathoggua and the Book of Eibon weremy creations, and were promptly utilized by Lovecraft.”5Clearly, an equally important resultant of Clark AshtonSmith’s additions to the Mythos can be seen as being theirsubstantiation, both of Lovecraft’s material, and of the channelsthrough which it was transmitted.In late 1954, Smith married Mrs. Carol Dorman, a divorceewith three teenage children, in Monterey, and moved to set uphome with his new family in nearby Pacific Grove. Despite a"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"succession of minor strokes, he continued to earn a smallincome by tending other people’s gardens. Though his wiferemained vague on the subject, it appears that Smith becamedeeply interested in Buddhism during his last years, if notactually converted. He died on August 14, 1961, aged 68."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"NOTES1. Like Lovecraft, Smith was also affected during childhoodby periods of ill-health, caused by some unidentifiedcondition.2. See appendix3. F. Lee Baldwin, in a biographical sketch of H.P. Lovecraftpublished in “Fantasy” magazine, April 1935, describes thefirst appearance of his story, “The Lurking Fear”: “Later in1922, ‘Home Brew’ published ‘The Lurking Fear’ as a four-part serial with illustrations by Clark Ashton Smith, whomhe met through amateur journalism.”4. This included Frank Belknap Long, August Derleth, HenryKuttner and Robert Bloch. (Of his fellow ‘weirdists’, Smithonly met Donald Wandrei and E. Hoffman Price in person.)5.
