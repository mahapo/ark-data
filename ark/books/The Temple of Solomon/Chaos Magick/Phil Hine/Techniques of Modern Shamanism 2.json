These are of course, not separaterealms, but areas of experience which mesh together all thetime. Separating them into three regions allows us to examinethem, and in turn, gain insights into how each contributes tothe other.The Social WorldThis is the everyday world of consensus reality - the conven-tions that we more or less agree to uphold with each other. Inthis world we take on various roles and play them in situationswhich are laid out to a set of ground rules. Understanding thesesocial rules and games enhances our ability to manage in thesocial world. Poor understanding or awareness of the subtle-ties of the social usually results in poor performances. Theexercises given in the section on the Social world look at dif-ferent ways of expressing and sharing our experiences, throughgroup activity.The Mythic WorldThis is the realm of metaphor and symbol; the larger-thanlifeworld of theatre, fantasy, legend and television culture. In ev-ery era, stories & legends have provided a mythic reflection ofour hopes, fears & aspirations. Our ancestors had the deeds ofheroes & goddesses, while we have the daily diet of film andtelevision soaps. This is the world where magick is perhaps atits most obvious, in which the shaman stands as a mythic fig-ure, interceding between personal visions and social cohesion,between the worlds of spirits and gods, and the people forwhom those spirits are a reality, yet remain mysterious. Thesection on the Mythic world looks at different approaches toexploring the Mythic, through innerworld journeying, Center-THE THREE WORLDS"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"6ing yourself, and working with Power Objects.The Personal WorldThis is the most intimate arena of our experience, the intrapsy-chic world of the self. Of the three worlds, this one holds themost mystery for us, and it is through the mythic world thatwe may plumb the depths of our personal experience. Knowl-edge of self is a key to all magickal development, and the exer-cises in this section begin the process of learning to look atones self and develop intuitive faculties.Of course, working in one realm is not enough, and youshould be looking at your development in terms of all threeworlds. The Personal and the Mythic will begin to mergethrough continued analysis and experience, but the Social -how we relate to other people; how we empathise with others -should be the world in which we look for signs of change anddevelopment. If you do not have any companions to explorethis work with, you should still bear in mind how the work youdo changes how you feel and behave socially, and what, if any,changes other people perceive in you. You may have a veryhigh opinion of yourself, but if everyone else thinks you’re aprat, then it might well be time to sit and think where you’regoing wrong.The shaman is an archetypal figure who mediates betweenthe most intimate aspects of our experience and the social con-ventions of community or peer group. The Mythic World isthat which stands ‘inbetween’ the Social and the Personal.Myths in all forms refer not only to historical (social) events,but draw deeply upon aspects of common human experience.Listening to a story-teller, or watching a film can ‘move’ usemotionally, so that we are transported momentarily into theMythic world. In this world, the conventions of social realitycan be challenged or overturned without threatening disaster.At the same time, the secrets of our psyche may be broughtforth & articulated without threatening the sense of being astable self. Myths have their roots in the ‘Deep Mind’, andprovide the rationale, or psychic drive, on which societies run."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"7Myths provide us with meaning and motivation, from the cul-tural fantasies of becoming a rock’n’roll star, or President ofthe United States of America. Or becoming a shaman, for thatmatter. Dictators in every era have learnt quickly that if youwant to weaken the will of a people, then you have to destroytheir dreams, making their myths meaningless and replacingthem with your own. The Dream-worlds of the Red IndiansAnd the Australian Aborigines were destroyed this way by thewhite invaders. Their psychic freedom was removed and theywere literally bound into a limited space, in which they werepoor, ignorant, second-class citizens. Myths affect us all, somuch of the time that we are not even aware of their effect.They become most dangerous (and insidious) when metaphoris mistaken for literal truth, and when stories become fixeddogmas.By entering the Mythic world for a time, we learn to changeourselves, and by so doing, bring about change in the worldaround us. Participation in this world may be shocking or dis-turbing, but above all, it can be healing. By enacting storieswhich give experience a Mythic stature, we can reintegrate thecontents of our psyche; come to see ourselves and our situa-tion from different angles, grow away from conditioned habitsand beliefs, and adapt to new courses of action which growfrom new insights. Once we enter the Mythic world, the nor-mal rules to which we abide may be suspended, and we arefree to converse with angels and dance with half-forgotten gods.The myths act to intensify the changes we pass through - birth,growth, rites of passage, loss, death and renewal. Participa-tion in the Mythic experience, whether as actor, mediator, oraudience, returns to us a sense of the dynamic vitality of life,which is all too easily forgotten in the day-today routine ofliving, and can revive our sense of the extraordinary, withinthe ordinary.The medium of the Mythic is our imagination, which knowsno barriers except those which we impose upon ourselves. Allideas have their source in the imagination, which springs fromthe Deep Mind, beyond Personal awareness or the Social world.There is always a certain amount of tension between the para-"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"8mount reality of the Social world, and individual wishes,dreams, and fantasies.Many people become interested in finding alternatives, spiri-tual growth or magickal reality from a growing dissatisfactionwith the “normal reality” of western culture. Many of us areseeking change and renewal and, rather than accepting the limitsof paramount reality, we are beginning to voyage beyond theexisting maps and pathways of living.A modern definition of magick is that it is an organisation ofthe imagination. Once we begin to explore the inner world ofthe Personal, and how it affects that of the Social (and viceversa), using a set of Mythic symbols and images, then we willbegin to have experiences which are meaningful within thosemyths. By assimilating ideas until they become familiar, weclothe our imagination into distinct forms, so that the DeepMind throws up images which accord with those myths.To go into the Deep Mind, we need signposts & maps tohelp us in our first, faltering steps. This is the task of visionar-ies, artists, shamans, magicians, indeed anybody can becomea ‘scout’ in this way. In modern western culture, we are nolonger bound by a dominant series of Mythic images. Instead,our culture abounds with myths, from those of magickal real-ity to that of Marxism, and we may adopt many such Mythicmaps of the world during our lives, knowing at any one time,that the current one we hold is truer than the others. There isa myriad of sects, philosophies, belief systems & religions whocan provide different sets of Mythic images. Some of us arehappy enough to accept an established mythic map, while oth-ers seek their own ways into truth. It is the growth of an unre-strained imagination which encourages us to transform ourdeepest longings into our highest aims, and thereon into achiev-able reality.An advantage, and a problem, for the would-be shamanicpractitioner, is this myriad of myths. We can draw from themythic pools of many different cultures across history, andcan also draw from fictional sources. The mythic power offiction is often undervalued because people persist in thinkingthat it “isn’t real”. Yet once we enter the Mythic world, his-"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"9torical validity is irrelevant. If a story moves us, and can giveus a valid and powerful experience, re-connecting us with deepaspects of our experience, then does it really matter whether itis ‘true’ in the historical sense? In recent years, writers onpopular shamanism like Lynn Andrews and Carlos Castenadahave both been criticised by people saying that they are writ-ing fiction disguised as fact. Whatever the case, their work hasallowed shamanic techniques to be much more accessible topeople, proving that they can act as an entry point for thosewho wish to explore the as yet uncharted realms which liebeyond the boundaries of the known world. Shamanism, atleast for me, is less about doing things in a certain way, butmore of an essence, a thread which runs through everything Ido. Thus all my magick has a shamanic quality to it, since,regardless of the flesh, it is the bones which are important. Itworks in a way which satisfies me and through me, appears tosatisfy the other people I work with as clients or colleagues;and in using shamanic techniques, I do not aspire to anythinggreater."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"10EXPLORING OUR PERSONAL WORLDSThe exercises in this section relate to the Personal World as anarena of our experience. The aim is to direct awareness to-wards the inner dynamics which shape our self-image; the half-heard (and often forgotten) internal dialogues out of whichgrows our story of who we are, and where we are going. Ofthe exercises in this book, these are written specifically forsolo work, although they can be used, with a little modifica-tion, as group exercises or points for discussion.Stories & ConversationsA great deal of our behaviour, beliefs and attitudes are con-tinually shaped by the inner conversations and stories whichwe have with ourselves. They are often of the nature that “Icannot be/do ..... because of ..... “. Many of them originate inour early learning experiences, or arise out of intense emo-tional situations. A common conversation is based around theidea “I can’t succeed at anything”, which of course means thatas long as I act from such a basis, I won’t try and overcomeanything that fulfills that prophecy. Some of the inner conver-sations are easy to recognise, while it is likely that others havebeen repressed, so that while we may be aware that somethingis going wrong in our lives, we can’t see the why.It’s essential that we begin to look at these conversations,and if possible, revise them or challenge them. Awareness ofyour own faults, weaknesses and blind spots is essential if youare attempting to develop yourself so that you can act moreeffectively. At times, a period of initiation will force upon youthe realisation of what a prat you’ve been for the past fewmonths. This is never pleasant, but you must try, at such apoint, to do something about it. Of course the more embeddedthe conversation is in your mind, the harder it is to change it.Often this is because you have something invested in uphold-ing that conversation. For example, if I “know” that I’m never"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"11going to succeed in anything, it’s easy to give things up, and ofcourse, much harder to break out of that conversation by actu-ally getting something done. However, these conversations serveto limit the range of possibilities open to you. If, on the otherhand, you do manage to break away from the limits you’veimposed on yourself, it’s like being brought into a new world,where to your vast surprise, you may find that you can do thatwhich you thought impossible. I’m not talking about thingslike flying or becoming master of the world, but the truly im-possible things that we’ve long ago convinced ourselves cannever happen, like getting on with your parents, paying offyour overdraft, or managing to hold a job down. Sure, it’spretty mundane stuff, but it’s usually this sort of problem whichhas the most effect on our lives. Now these problems can’t betackled all at once, but they can be approached, so long asyou’re aware of them, and prepared to act on them. All ‘Im-peccable Warriors’ will find their worst foes in the realm ofthe ordinary worlds (Social & Personal), rather than the Mythic.The foes are, of course, the barriers which we set up ourselves,and then cling to, all the while becoming tenser and tenserabout doing so.ShieldsThis is an exercise from The Shamanic Development Course,but it comes up in many different forms and styles. The basicidea is that you produce a symbolic representation of yourselfand the things most important to you, ideals, directions in whichyou wish to to travel, etc. This can be as complicated or assimple as you wish, and designs can follow a wide variety ofpatterns such as free-form paintings, collages, a wheel dividedinto the four quarters (with yourself standing at the centre), ora mandala. These shields are useful in group ‘sharing’ discus-sions when members are discussing personal feelings and ide-als with each other. In many ways, they are ‘maps’ of our ownfield of experience, displaying territories, high points of inter-est, hopes and fears. Elaborated, the shield may become a ‘lifeplan’ - where you wish to develop, in the various ‘segments’"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"12of the shield, for a given period. How long this is depends onhow much you make your shield an ‘overall view’. I have heardof people doing fifty-year life plans, and if you think that’s along time, there are two hundred and fifty year life shields!Not that many people plan to live that long, but the idea is thatyou create a vision of what you want to happen in the world asa consequence of you having lived. Which is good, positivethinking; that no matter how small the change, you will havecontributed something to the development of your tribe - thehuman race.In a group setting, you can work together to develop ‘GroupShields’, which are an expression of the group becoming acollective entity. In designing and making a group shield, youare drawing on the power of banners, coats of arms, clan tat-toos etc, that all reinforce the group’s identity, and becomeattractants for the group’s energies. Over time, group and in-dividual shields can become powerful magical devices, whichcan be drawn upon in various exercises and activities. Groupswho perform seasonal rites and celebrations sometimes evolve“Year Wheels”, which at once both reflect and remind mem-bers of how the group has grown and evolved through the year,with appropriate symbols, images, and “talismanic” objectsfrom each seasonal rite represented on the wheel.ScryingScrying is a basic divinatory technique which helps to developone’s clairvoyant abilities. It can be performed using any re-flective surface, such as a mirror, preferably a shiny blacksurface, or a bowl filled with dark fluid. Gazing into the em-bers of a fire is another common method. Scrying requires thatyou be able to enter a light trance state where image arise inyour mind, rather like day-dream visions, or the pictures thatyou see before falling asleep. The ‘trick’ of scrying is to tryand relax, and let any images appear before you, gazing steadilyinto the medium that you are using, without staring too hard orintensely concentrating. This only comes with practice. At firstit should be enough to let random images well up, and later on"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"13to try and answer specific questions.The area in which you are practicing should be dimly lit,and lights (candles are excellent, being less harsh than electriclights) placed so that they do not reflect in the medium you areusing. Incense can also be a useful aid, particularly those res-ins & oils which act as relaxants. You may find it useful toperform a meditation or relaxation exercise prior to attempt-ing to scry. A Centering ritual, performed before and afterscrying, is also recommended.Pathworkings designed to relax and stimulate the Deep (sub-conscious) Mind to throw up images can be used. Scrying canlead to drowsiness, and it is a good idea not to make yourinitial practice sessions go on for too long.Divinatory techniques such as these help develop the intui-tive and psychic faculties, and the trick of relaxing and lettingimages arise in your mind is also a key to other talents such aspsychometry and aura reading. Once you have tried the basicmethod, then regular practice will help you develop it.Smoke MirrorThis is a meditative/reflective exercise developed from aDramatherapy exercise (originally by Marsha Robbins). Itshould be performed sitting or lying down, and preceded byCentering or a few minutes of relaxation & deep breathing.“Try and become very quiet inside. As you breathe, imaginethe breath you exhale gradually becoming smoke, which formsa billowing cloud before you. The cloud clears, forming be-fore you a full-length mirror, in which you can see yourself.Examine yourself slowly and calmly, and at first, pay atten-tion to your posture, and how the mirror reflects your body - itmay exaggerate some part of your body, such as your head, oryour hands, for it reflects aspects of yourself that you are notalways conscious of. Once you have examined yourself to yourown satisfaction, you will find that the mirror begins to cloudover. As it does so, try and think of a time when you were veryyoung, preferably under the age of twelve, and see an image ofyourself forming in the mirror before you. What do you look"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"14like? What are you wearing? What is it like to be that age?Who are your friends? What do you like to do best? Whatstories do you tell yourself? What makes you angry? Whatscares you? What would you like to change? Now, as you turnthese questions over in your mind, you find that the Mirror isbecoming a doorway to your past - that you are able to speakto your younger self and have a conversation back and forth -is there anything special which you need to say? Make contactin any way that you wish (allow time for this).Then, as you regard your younger self in the mirror, it be-gins to cloud over, turning slowly into smoke again, billowingand growing thinner, and you know that as you breathe in, youare drawing the experience inside you again, and retaining theawareness of your encounter with your younger self. Whenthe smoke has vanished, count backwards from10...9...8...7...6...5...4...3...2...1... And Awake!”For maximum effect, this guided fantasy (not a pathworking)should be taped onto a cassette recorder. I find that it helps tofollow the “Awake” instruction with some light bell tones. Anyinsights you have can then be committed to paper or cassettetape. This exercise can, of course, be used in a group situa-tion. Meeting ourselves in younger “incarnations” is therapeu-tic - aiding memory and self-awareness, and it also reminds usthat much of our “adult” self has grown from earlier experi-ence, although we do not always like to acknowledge this.Power SpotsThis section was developed from the ideas of Stephen Mace,an American magician whose work is worth much scrutiny (ifyou can find it - see the Resources section at the end of thisbook). It is all too easy, when attempting to set shamanisticpractices within a modern context, to resort to an overly psy-chological attitude, and place much emphasis on inner-direct-edness. We are encouraged to find our power from within, butat the same time, should remain mindful that power is all aroundus. In addition to the power within us, there are the vast, cos-mic tides within, and around us, and also, there are Power"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"15Spots. These may be considered as magickal vents on the sur-face of the earth, or pores in the skin of Gaia. If found andmade knowable, they can be tapped, supplementing your ownpower, or providing points of contact with the innerworldsthrough which we gain access and knowledge of the other en-tities with which we share the biosphere. The discovery ofsuch Power Spots is a personal process, requiring intuition,critical insight and common sense. Here, the Personal Worldderives from your own interaction with the surrounding land-scape. Writers such as Carlos Casteneda and Lynn Andrewsboth place emphasis on the importance of discovering spotsthat for you - have personal power, and both warn that, just aspower may pour out of a place, so too a place can suck powerdown into itself - to the detriment of the unwary. All too com-mon is the assumption that all stone circles or ley points areappropriate places for ritual or other forms of magickal work.A more prudent approach is to try and suss out the “vibes” ofa place, by allowing yourself to become receptive to fleetingimpressions (see Walking Between the Worlds), or using dows-ing or scrying.A “traditional” type of power spot is the place where roadscross, associated with deities such as Hecate (Greek), Odinn(Norse), Ganesha (Hindu) and Papa Legba (Haitian). Thereare also numerous folk tales about meeting “the devil” at cross-roads. If this holds true for the modern age (and why not?),then tangles of motorway such as the Spaghetti Junction mustbe sources of strange power indeed!In general, there are two types of Power Spot. The first is aplace that is associated with a specific type of power. A con-tact point where, if we enter trance (the techniques of whichare described in WBTW) and project ourselves into an appro-priate innerworld, we can gain some understanding, or feelingof, a specific element. Thus, if you wish to enhance your rap-port with the earth, then a cave or narrow valley may suffice.To call upon the powers of the sea, some vantage point aroundwhich the tide surges will engender the appropriate mood. Tofeel the brooding energies of a city, the roof of a multi-storeybuilding may be the best vantage point. One of my favourite"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"16routes for contemplation was a walk through miles of desertedfactory buildings - a hollow testament to the industrial declineof the Colne Valley, populated only by rats, cats, and the ghostsof the Industrial Revolution.The second type of Power Spots are more difficult to dis-cover, and rely much more on your personal openness to clair-voyance, omens, and sensory awareness. The easiest way torecognise the more specific type of Power Spot is to look forincongruities of terrain. Examples of this are a single rocksticking up out of acres of grass or marsh, or a solitary springor tree on a whole mountain. Any element which is a starkcontrast to the rest of the surrounding landscape can be a po-tential source of power. Only personal discovery and experi-mentation will discover the affinity the spot has with any par-ticular activity. Some spots are conducive to trance work, whilstothers may diffuse an energy that helps you center yourself.Now while some spots may feel weird, this doesn’t automati-cally mean that they are good to use. Some spots you willencounter will have a definitely malign feel to them, andshouldn’t be messed about with. It doesn’t mean that they’re“Evil”, or even that they’re sources of ‘negative energy’ - allpowerful places should be treated with respect, and it is worthbearing in mind that we don’t automatically have the right touse any place we want to, just because it feels strange. A com-mon piece of lore in many lands is that of a Genius Loci, or‘place spirit’ - the idea that certain spots have their own guard-ians. It is worth bearing this in mind when you approach powerspots.Omens are harder still to spot, but again, depend upon howaware you are of fluctuations in your personal landscape. Theymay come in the form of meetings with animals, unusual cloudformations, or coincidental meetings with friends. If you goout with the attitude that you are prepared to be led by omens,you will often obtain interesting results. Much depends on be-ing open to the possibilities of an adventure. I was once led toa power spot by a cat who insisted that I follow it across fieldsto a tree stump, whereon it promptly shot off into the under-growth. The important thing is to start to behave as though"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"17these things are real - and who is to say that they are not? Inturn, this mindful wandering about, whether it is through fieldsor city streets, enhances our awareness of surroundings, bothphysically and psychically. It also gives a greater awarenessof our personal relationship with the ‘scapes through whichwe move. Each place has it’s own pulse and beat, and by be-coming open and aware of it, we can immerse ourselves, at avery personal level, with the life around us. This can allow usto sense the subtle changes in patterns of life that constantlyswirl around us. Haitian shamans say that each person of powerhas their own “garden”. Your sense of “garden” may not ex-tend past your front gate, or on the other hand, it may cover anentire region of the city in which you dwell. The sense of thisis harder to convey, but is an essential feature of magickalliving - being open to omens, signs and imports - feeling theripples in your garden, whether through dream or vision, aschanges and visitors appear.A related exercise from the Shamanic Development Course,developed by Sheila Broun, is called “Finding your Place ofPower”. To do this we chalked a nine-foot circle in a room,then asked group members to walk around it, trying to “feel”what was the most appropriate place for them within it, andwhen they had decided, to sit on that place. When all had cho-sen their spot, a compass was produced and the four directionsidentified. This exercise was then used as a starter for a dis-cussion on the role of the circle, and the four cardinal points inmagick."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"18EXPLORING OUR SOCIAL WORLDSThe exercises in this section are a variety of group exercises,chosen for their value in demonstrating the value of group ex-perimentation. I believe that one of the main strengths of groupshamanic exploration is the sense of the communal. In creat-ing a space where we can inspire each other, and experimentwith relatively simple exercises that nevertheless bring aboutamazing results, we can learn that there is little need to ac-quire lots of “knowledge” from books or “teachers”. Shamanictechniques are not bound up with concepts such as “spiritual-ity” or “personal transformation” - shamanic magick is firmlyrooted in the social world of meetings, dramas, and gather-ings. Whether you are undertaking identity work or investigat-ing the worlds of the Mythic, you must eventually return to theworld around you.SoundscapesSoundscapes are a group exercise in exploring how to usewords, tones and sound patterns to build up a “picture” - cre-ating the atmosphere appropriate to the chosen theme. Myfavourite example of a vocal Soundscape is one produced byan experimental drama group, when asked to express the themeof “Sweets”. The group members each chose “mantras” usedin advertising jingles and developed individual rhythms, so thatthe resulting Soundscape was a mix of:1. “Only the crumbl-iest, flaki-est choc-late, tastes like choco-late nev-er tasted bee-fore!” (drawn out, sung high)2. “Hot chocolate, Drink-ing chocolate.” (Chanted fast). 3.“Skit-tles” (repeated with a pause inbetween)4. “Mars-Bars” (Bass chant, slower than No.2)5. “Smartie-People-are-happy-people” (light refrain)Get the idea? It’s useful to get people to brainstorm ideasabout a particular subject or theme, and then to choose oneword or phrase to use as the beginnings of a chant. You can"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"19also use soundscapes to evoke and exaggerate moods, and de-velop groupgrown chants for rituals and spellcasting.DreamscapesI was introduced to the idea of Dreamscaping while partici-pating in an experimental drama group - The Theatre of Voo-doo (now sadly defunct). The basic idea is that as groups gothrough the process of forming, people obviously become moreintimate with each other, and this can be reflected by shareddreams, or dreams where members of the group are in a par-ticular situation. As a group develops, it also develops a sharedpsychic space - the Gestalt (a German word meaning ‘morethan the sum of its parts’) mind. Dreamscaping is a develop-ment of role-playing where one person describes their dream,and the group works to turn the elements of the dream into adramatic event, where the originator of the dream takes on oneof the dream-figure roles, and someone else becomes the‘dreamer’. One of the examples that we tried was that usingthe theme of “nightmares”, we all shared recurring nightmareexperiences, and then scripted out a play that used imageryfrom each group members’ dreams. The dreamscapes werebuilt up using a combination of soundscaping, tapes, lightingeffects, masks and other props. We found that working witheach others’ dream images helped develop a kind of groupmythic world, which could be accessed through dreams andgroup activities.Acting out dreams is also very beneficial in terms of under-standing your own dream-symbolism, and we found that aswe began to work with each others dreams, then images fromeach others dream-worlds would begin to ‘bleed’ into eachothers’ dream-experiences. Dreamscaping can give rise toemotional surges, and it is wise to go carefully with it. It wouldbe interesting to find out if it is possible to enter a sleepingperson’s dreamworld using this kind of practice. We think ofdreams as highly personal, but they can be brought into thesocial world - and likewise, the social world can provide uswith a backdoor to them."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"20MimeI think that my first awareness of not knowing what to do withmy hands came to me during one of my first attempts at publicspeaking. They were suddenly transformed from manipula-tors of tools to inconvenient things which, no matter what I didwith them, didn’t make me feel very comfortable. It was onlywhen I began to look at how stage performers used their hands- in either emphasising speech or giving out another messageentirely, that I began to realise the potential and power of mimeand gesture. Being able to mime messages is a useful skill,which is very much part of the shamanic repertoire, used bytricksters, sacred clowns and performers in every age and cul-ture. For example, a man sits cross-legged, eyes closed andface impassive. A woman approaches carefully, exaggeratingher movements. Squatting beside him, she appears to be care-fully extracting something wormlike from the mans ear - hegrimaces with pain, while all her movements suggest that theworm (if such it is) is resisting her efforts to withdraw it. Fi-nally, with a flourish, she yanks it out, and as the man relaxes,she rubs her hands together, as though cleaning something slimyfrom herself. Now depending on the circumstances, this scenecould be a comedy acted out for amusement, or the descriptioncould equally well apply to a shamanka healing a client byextracting a bad spirit. The point I’m making is that while wecan use mime while clowning or communicating, its also animportant part of other magick, such as healing or wrestlingwith spirits.Miming is also a useful technique because of its elements ofbeing a physical language. Spoken language, is for the mostpart, directed to our waking awareness. Physical languages,on the other hand, speak directly to the Deep Mind. Look aroundyou and see how we all utilise gestures, and you will begin tounderstand that a great deal of their power comes from ouralmost unthinking reactions to them. We can, quickly and sim-ply, convey a message with a few gestures in less time than itwould take to speak or write them. Gestures also reinforce the"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"21‘power’ of a spoken phrase. An easy way to demonstrate thisis to have people try out giving conflicting spoken messagesand gestures, such as telling someone to “come here”, while atthe same time gesturing for them to stay where they are oreven go away!It can also be useful to look at sign languages, such as thosedeveloped for people who have no, or impaired speech. Expe-rienced users can ‘sign’ much faster than if the same messagewas spoken aloud, and sign languages are also used in situa-tions where the need for silence is paramount - such as in hunt-ing or warfare. This leads on of course, to the idea of sacredgestures - such as used by sacred dancers, those performingBodymind disciplines, and ritual gestures.In Walking Between The Worlds I mentioned Shape-Shift-ing as an example of using mime, but of course any recognisablefigure from folklore to television soaps could be suitable, pro-viding they have a base characteristic which can be workedon. Here are some Mime exercises which I have used in groups:ElementalsThe set-up of this exercise requires the group to be lying down,with plenty of space between each person, and the facilitatorperched on a chair or stool in the middle. The facilitator ex-plains that s/he is a mighty wizard, whilst the group form thebase for elementals, of different natures, and that the wizard isgoing to allow them to take on the shape of the elemental na-tures. The ‘wizard’ gives images using phrases, whilst the groupmime, in their own ways, the feelings and thoughts which thosephrases evoke. A sequence might go on the lines of:1. Earth - tectonic plates shifting, continents drifting, gran-ite hills grinding against each other, earth tremors, rumblings,volcanoes belching forth...2. Fire - flames dancing, reaching forth, consuming, writh-ing, growing, spreading, whipped by the wind, becoming...3. Air - gentle breezes, sudden gusts, rising, falling, cloudsdancing, tornadoes swirling, storms bending low above thewater, reaching lower across the waves..."},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"224. Water - the depths, gentle swirls, currents, trickling, flow-ing, gurgling, crashing, storms at sea, breakers, surf, pound-ing against the rocks...becoming rocks againAt this point you could go back to earth, and bring everyoneto rest again, or you could go further, and mime the growth oftrees, or even cities.Another development of this exercise is, when performingrituals, to have people acting as elementals, and to dance ormime their particular element, to add its power to the ritual.This kind of group activity can be enhanced by each individualexploring their own personal relationship with each element.Mime GamesGroup games involving mime can range from sitting in a circleand miming an action to one’s neighbour - who must then guesswhat the mime was, to miming each other’s characteristic pos-tures and gestures. While these are games, they act as a useful(and fun) introduction to the power of mime & gesture. Oncewe begin to look at the everyday power of these physical lan-guages, then we can start to work around them. Two-minuteplaylets can be useful here, for example, quick mimes of vari-ous creation myths. Mimes can also be acted out in slow mo-tion - when combined with other techniques, it can be veryeffective in enhancing group trances."},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"23EXPLORING OUR MYTHIC WORLDSThe bulk of this booklet is concerned with techniques and con-cepts related to working in the Mythic arena of our experi-ence. The following exercises should be taken as guidelinesfor beginning such an exploration. Where possible, I have at-tempted to explain the underlying structure beneath an exer-cise or concept, and to relate them to the Social and PersonalWorlds.Innerworld ExplorationsThe ‘Innerworlds’ are the mindscapes which we can travel in,encountering various entities, and moving through transfor-mative experience and learning, using stories, legends, andcycles which have Mythic proportions. But are they real? youmight ask. That really depends on who you ask, and answerswill probably range from one extreme - yes they are real, tono, they are no more than imaginary fantasies. Either extremeis a misunderstanding of the nature of imagination. In any case,when you approach magick, the whole idea of subjective andobjective realities becomes obsolete. We tend to think of theimagination as a passive quality, not as a medium throughwhich we can affect the world. Yet through the imagination,given structure and meaning by being clothed in symbolic im-ages, we can tap the release the energies of the Deep Mind tochange our selves - to perform identity work, to influence ourbodymind complexes, or to bring about changes in the ‘exter-nal’ reality around us.The innerworlds are real in so far as we invest belief in them.The innerworlds are mindscapes which reflect and reinforceparticular transformative learning experiences, so that we canfocus awareness onto one set of experiences, isolating and in-tensifying them, out of what Austin Osman Spare called “thechaos of the normal.” Our relationship to them is much likeour relationship with the worlds we enter when we watch “the"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"24silver screen” of film or television. Despite knowing that theseworlds are illusory, we still get caught up in the plot of TVsoaps, get frightened by horror films, stirred by drama - it’snot unknown for periods of initiation to be triggered by a filmor television programme. It is the quality of belief which al-lows these worlds to become real, and a lot of people, invest-ing an innerworld with belief over a long period of time, give itpower so that it becomes Mythic - a reflection of our psychol-ogy; our hopes, fears, aspirations, through stereotypes - enti-ties which embody particular qualities or facets of our experi-ence. The main difference between the electronically-gener-ated innerworlds and those magickally generated is the inten-sity of transformative experience that they afford us. A TVsoap opera like ‘Eastenders’ has many points of contact withour Social & Personal worlds - the stories are those of socialrelations and there is little that is inherently esoteric. The in-tensity of fantasy is low, and the so the world of Eastendersseems just within reach.Let’s look at something a bit more fantastic - the world of‘Star Trek’. More people are familiar with the universe of StarTrek than any of the mystery religions. It’s a fairly safe betthat more people are going to know who Mr. Spock is, thanwho know who Lugh is. The Star Trek universe has a highfantasy content, and seemingly few points of contact with our‘everyday’ worlds of experience. Yet Star Trek is a modern,mythic reflection of our psychology. The characters embodyspecific qualities - Spock is logical, Sulu is a often portrayedas a martial figure, Scotty is a ‘master builder’, and Kirk is anarbitrator, forever seeking resolution of conflict through peace-ful means. As we “get into” the Star Trek universe, we findgreater depth and subtlety. We find that the universe has itsown rules which the characters are subject to, and is internallyconsistent. Each episode, we may find that we are being giveninsights into the Personal world of a key character. Like oureveryday worlds, the universe of Star Trek has a boundarybeyond which is the unknown - the future, unexplored space,the consequences of our actions - whatever wild cards that wemay be dealt. So we watch TV, and enter, as an observer, the"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"25unfolding of a Mythic event. We can increase this sense ofparticipation through a role-playing game, where group beliefallows us to generate, for a few hours at least, the semblanceof the Star Trek universe, in the comfort of your sitting room.It’s relatively easy to generate the Star Trek world, due to theplethora of books, comics, videos and roleplaying supplementswhich are available to support that universe.Now this is all very well you might say, but after all, it’sonly entertainment. The magickal innerworlds are concernedwith spiritual development and bringing about a change inconsciousness, and doesn’t television stifle the imaginationanyway? The answer of course, is that it depends how you useit. The world of magick & shamanism abounds with expertsand authorities on every subject. Sooner or later you’re goingto have to develop a sense of discrimination as to what is use-ful for you and what isn’t. As you’ve probably guessed bynow, I’m well into Star Trek. While I’m entertained by enter-ing the Star Trek universe, I could also use it (with some modi-fication) as a Mythic world in which to enter into to bringabout change.What I’m saying is that I don’t favour one set of innerworldsover the others - Star Trek, Celtic Myth, Tarot trumps, Al-chemical images, Greek creation stories, Amerind worlds - it’sreally a case of whatever turns you on. Some people mightargue that the older a Mythic cycle is, the more powerful it is.This isn’t necessarily true though - it seems more importantthat the clarity of the essential nature of the cycle is reflected,rather than muddied, by the images and symbols used. Oldmyths have very often, been messed about with. Much de-pends on who’s writing them down, and from what angle -myths can be bent by politics.When approaching innerworlds, it is the underlying struc-ture that is important, rather than the surface details. It’s use-ful to bear in mind the following points:1.The symbolism & imagery should be internally consis-tent. If you are going to use Celtic symbolism, then the intru-"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"26sion of something patently non-Celtic, like a laser gun, isn’tgoing to reinforce your belief in that innerworld’s ‘realness’.2. Don’t go overboard on detail. People who have playedfantasy role-playing games should appreciate this - you can’tmake an innerworld too detailed, as it’ll take you hours towork through it. The imagination works best when it has freeareas in which to flow, where symbols and images arise or-ganically from the Deep Mind. No world is complete in itself,and the innerworlds are a means of approaching the unknown.The most powerful symbols are often the simplest, clearly statedor momentarily glimpsed. A recent example of this I experi-enced was during a pathworking designed to create the appro-priate mood for scrying. It was a simple walk through a desert,until we came to two vast pillars of rock. Standing betweenthem was a guide - a Jackal-headed god who led us into anunderground temple which was to be the place where the scryingtook place. The imagery was vaguely Egyptian, but very loose.Instead of giving a full description of the guide (Anubis) as atraditional Egyptian God-Form, he was merely described as“...jackal-headed God...opener of the way”. The image I sawwas that of a jackal-headed humanoid, wearing a complex suitof body-armour, with pipes and circuitry visible, and with laser-light beams penetrating the darkness. It may have not beenexactly traditional, but it was appropriate for me, which iswhat counts.3.Allow yourself to enter different situations. You can de-vise an innerworld where everything is nice and pleasant andrelaxing - if relaxation is all you require. If however, you areseeking change, such as in identity work, then you will have toenter situations which are challenging, daunting and even fright-ening. By focusing on different aspects of the self, reflectedthrough the Mythic images, an innerworld working can triggerthe transformative process in us, which enables us to adaptand change in the ways that we desire. Many innerworld jour-neys are feints at death - threatening the ego with breakdown,so that we may slowly transform ourselves into more vital and"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"27dynamic patterns. The more potent the images and symbols,the further they reach into the Deep Mind.4. A map is very helpful. Want to go somewhere you’venever been before? Easy, you get a map. The map isn’t theterritory itself, but it’s a tool to help you find your way in,about, and out of the territory. The same is true for theinnerworlds, and this is why there is such a multitude of cos-mological and psychological maps abounding in different cul-tures, from the maps allowing us to enter fictional worlds tothe shamanic cosmologies and the more formal structure ofthe Qabalah. These maps are not merely arbitrary concepts,but act to focus and direct the energies tapped through enter-ing the symbolic structures. The maps are in a sense circuitdiagrams, allowing us to differentiate between different as-pects of experience. By creating patterns of ordered experi-ence, we can harness the powers of the Deep Mind. Thus weenter different innerworlds for different reasons, and can enterinto different Mythic structures to achieve particular goals.As you develop, you will tend to find that you will discover‘secret routes’ to territories not marked on the map you arefollowing, or, as a result of your exploration, find territorieswhich have never been mapped before! All sacred maps have“hidden doors”, tunnels or portals through which only thosewho know the “sacred alignments” may enter. You must learnto know your way around the well-trodden paths before youcan start taking chances with the invisible routes.5. Don’t overdo it. Innerworld journeying can be a very use-ful technique, but it has its limitations and even dangers. Themost obvious danger is that it is habit-forming. You can get tothe extreme where you prefer your innerworld to what’s goingon around you, and it is easy to lose your sense of balance anddiscrimination. Innerworld Journeying is popular - you can doit alone, using a book or tape, and it doesn’t take much effort.It can serve to reinforce the division between mind and bodywhich is so prelevant in our culture. It is at this point that youshould call your attention to why you are doing this in the first"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"28place. Innerworld journeying is a means - to enhanced aware-ness, insight, and to connect strings of symbols and associa-tions in the Deep Mind - and not an end in itself. Bear in mindthat they can trigger powerful transformative experiences, andshould be approached with caution. Some form of Centeringexercise (described later) is useful as a prelude, and follow-on, to pathworking.6. Keep a record of all journeys. This has to be stressed,time and time again. I know that our ancestors didn’t writethings down, but nor did they live in a culture that is fast ap-proaching information overload, where so many signals jostlefor attention that its’s all too easy to forget things. Keeping arecord is a discipline - it helps ground your experiences, andgives you a means of assessing your progress. Describing im-ages, sights and encounters also helps embed the images in ourminds, and people often find that, when writing down apathworking, they remember things that they had forgotten, ornot noticed, earlier.How are Pathworkings Useful?The number of mindscapes are infinite - limited only perhapsby your own notions of the worlds you want to enter.Pathworking provides us with a way of entering larger-than-life situations where, in participating in a mythic cycle, meet-ing with goddesses, spirits, beings from all aspects of reality,you may gain new insights about ourselves and the world, orcan initiate new cycles of change and activity. You can exploresymbols & myths which arise from the Social world - from thepast and from fantasy, and you can also explore images whicharise from the Personal world. Through them, you can exploredream imagery consciously; re-enter your personal past anddiscover the forgotten or hidden oaths or promises which wemake to ourselves. You can explore other senses, using music,incense or tastes, and “see” what associations and images wellup from the Deep Mind. You can take on the shapes of ani-mals, real or imaginary, and discover qualities which might liebeyond other people’s writings and correspondences. You can"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"29“die” periodically, and be reborn, altered subtly by the experi-ence. You can form relationships with spirits of all aspects,which can then be further worked into other magickal activi-ties. Perhaps most importantly, they can help in developingboth the intuition and the sense of discrimination. Not every-thing you’ll encounter in your mindscapes will be benevolent,nor will it necessarily be telling the truth. We have an amazingcapacity for lying to ourselves, making out we know things wedon’t, trying to impress others, and these qualities, just as anyothers, can be found in the innerworlds. All magickal systemshave stories about this, about spirits who lie or distract theunwary. Ghosts are notoriously capricious, and you need todevelop a sense to recognise the validity of an experience. Thisis difficult, especially in a society like ours when most infor-mation comes out of books or a screen. This, like many othertimes, is where it is beneficial to have someone else around totalk to.You can begin experimenting with pathworkings by perform-ing simple journeys based around the images of what you knowabout yourself. You must be willing to explore and map theareas of self - likes, dislikes, habits, fears, past experiencesand dreams, translating them into images from which you canbase a journey on; otherwise, the mindscapes you consciouslydecide to explore may serve only to further distort the story ofhow you would like to see yourself as, and how you actuallyare."},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"30AXIS MUNDIThe Axis Mundi, or central axis, is the centre of the shamanicuniverse. It is the point from which the shamanka can begin alljourneys, and is found, in different guises, in all shamanic andmagickal systems. The Axis Mundi is the place “where all thespheres meet”, from which the shaman can move into any ofthe innerworlds, and perform magickal feats and tasks. It ap-pears, in different cultures, in many forms. For example, forthe Warao Indians of Venezuala, the hub of the universe is thethe sacred rattle. In Haitian Voudou, the crossroads is the cen-tral point “where all roads meet”. A contemporary practitio-ner of Voudou has described New York City in terms of everycrossroads being a place sacred to the Gods, and references tocrossroads as places with magickal virtue can be found in Brit-ish folklore. Elsewhere, the axis mundi appears as a sky lad-der, world-tree, post, pillar, or sacred mountain. The image ofthe world-tree is a very enduring one, which appears inshamanic cultures all over the world, and it is likely that theBiblical tree of knowledge, and its esoteric counterpart, the‘Otz Chaim’ of Qabalah have been developed from shamanis-tic sources. Remember, shamanism is the root of magick, aswell as art, dance, theatre, and philosophy. All magickal sys-tems have elements of the shamanic in them. The world-treeimage also appears in alchemical texts, is depicted in cave-paintings that date back to the Palaeolithic era, and in tantrikiconography as the tree on which the sacred letters of the Hindualphabet hang.It is important to recognise that, for practitioners of magick(whatever approach you adopt), that the Axis Mundi is notonly a physical object or place, but also an internal condition -the axis, as it were, of your inner life and experience. It is amatter of poise or equilibrium - developing inner balance. Atfirst, this statement seems to be paradoxical, after all, much ofshamanic activity often comes across as incomprehensible to"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"31the outsider, and as I pointed out in Walking Between TheWorlds, shamanic work can be very taxing, both mentally andphysically. A popular misconception has arisen is that the sha-man is an outsider figure, because of some form of insanitywhich is seen as ‘sacred’. There is little evidence to supportthis. Although shamanic experience does involve periodic boutsof psychic crises, vocational illnesses, and descents into theunderworld by means of some form of creative derangement,these are but necessary transitions, or ‘peak’ periods of initia-tion. It is through these trials that the shamanka develops thepoise and balance necessary to journey between the worldsand work with spirits. Mircea Eliade, in his classic work onshamanism explains the relationship between the shaman andthe initiatory trials:“That such maladies nearly always appear in relation tothe vocation of medicine men is not at all surprising. Like thesick man, the religious man is projected onto a vital planethat shows him the fundamental data of human existence, thatis, solitude, danger, hostility of the surrounding world. But ..the shaman, is not only a sick man; he is, above all, a sickman who has been cured, who has succeeded in curing him-self.”Don’t forget that it is the shaman who acts to mediate be-tween community and cosmology - between the tribe, and theworld of spirits, omens and ancestors. Another popular mis-conception is that if you are using shamanic techniques, thenyou don’t have to perform any long-winded or rigorousmagickal exercises such as yoga or visualisation. Some peopleseem to think that because shamanic magick is seen to be‘spontaenous’ or ‘intuitive’, then you can get away with a hap-hazard approach. This, to put it bluntly, is foolishness. Youcan be this kind of ‘shaman’ in the safety of your bedsit, but inthe wild world, sloppy shamans wouldn’t last very long! Ifyou look at legends from differing shamanic cultures, they alltend to emphasise that not just anybody is a shaman; that to bea shaman requires a sense of inner balance or poise, whether"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"32you are running up a ladder of knives or crossing a chasmwhich is spanned only by a single strand of hair.CenteringHaving emphasised the need for balance, let’s have a look atsome exercises that will help you develop it. This sort of workis generally known as Centering. In Western (post GoldenDawn) magick it is also known as banishing. The most well-known form of banishing is the short ritual known as the “ban-ishing ritual of the lesser pentagram” which involves tracingpentagrams in the air, invoking archangels, and calling on di-vine forces. Hold on, you might think, this isn’t very ‘shamanic’is it? Well don’t worry, I’m not going to describe it (see Fur-ther Reading for more details), nor am I going to foist a‘shamanic’ counterpart onto you. What is important, however,is the principles behind this exercise. In Western ritual magick,a banishing is performed at the beginning and end of everyworking, whether this be full-scale ritual, an innerworld jour-ney, meditation etc. The first banishing acts to help you pre-pare yourself in the following ways:1. It focuses your attention on the work you are about to do,and helps you close off from thinking about everyday con-cerns - bills, what you’re having for dinner, etc.2. It allows you to begin to take up your ‘role’ as a Mythicfigure yourself - however you like to see yourself when work-ing magickally.3. Most importantly of all, it acts to Center yourself withinyour magickal universe.So what does Centering involve? Most Centering exercises,whatever tradition or culture they originate from, share simi-lar elements. These are:1. Marking out or otherwise defining the area being used as‘sacred space’.2. Symbolically ordering, by identification, the main zones,gates, or dimensions of the chosen magickal universe. The"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"33centerpoint of which becomes the Axis Mundi - a physicalreflection and reinforcement of one’s inner poise.3. Identification with a chosen source of inspiration - merg-ing the macrocosm (total universe) with the microcosm (self).The first part of the exercise is known generally in WesternMagick as “Casting the Circle”. Here’s Sheila Broun describ-ing how she creates her circles:“By formally creating a circle, you define the boundaries inwhich you are working. I like to create my circle by decoratingit. I place incense or feathers in the east for air, along with anappropriate colour such as blue. Candles and red things in thesouth for fire, water and shells in the west, and rocks and crys-tals in the north.”Other ways of defining the space include sweeping it out,setting up staves carved with the heads of totemic animals,marking out the territory with ash, chalk, flour or cords, orlaying down cloth with patterns traced on them.The second part is to symbolically order your magickal uni-verse. The sacred space is a reflection of the wider universe,so by moving to what is in effect the Axis Mundi, you canaccess or influence any part of the universe. This can be doneby marking out the basic elements of the universe. This canrange from the simple - The four cardinal directions of east,south, west and north, to complex arrays of gateways and tun-nels. In the standard Western Centering, the magician standsat the centre of the four directions, having focused on each asphysical direction, inner qualities, and spiritual force. Again,this takes various forms, such as calling upon the four winds(Greek mythology), the four great archangels of the qabalah,the elemental stewards of Hindu myth, or the four ‘watchtow-ers’ in Wicca (which originates from the Enochian magick ofDr. John Dee, an Elisabethan magus). Some systems, such asChinese or Tantrik magick, divide the circle into eight direc-tions. It also helps to place any elemental Power Objects thatyou have at the appropriate points of the circle.The third part of the exercise sounds abstract, but is quitesimple. In effect, you adopt the stance of being “at one” with"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"34whatever image or symbol you have of the primal source en-ergy - such as “the Great Spirit”, a Goddess or God, Tao,Void, etc.The symbols & images which are adopted to enact the exer-cise are, generally, up to you. The most important thing is thatthey be meaningful, and consistent with whatever symbols andimages you are working with. If you are exploring Celtic sha-manism, then a Qabalistically-based centering ritual will be abit incongruous. It is important to use symbols & images whichare powerful for you because centering stirs the Deep Mind,triggering associations and images. If you focus attention onthe east for example, calling a chosen spirit to stand beforeyou and become ‘part’ of the circle; what you are effectivelydoing is to link a series of associations: the physical qualitiesof the relevant element - the psychological qualities of the ele-ment - the spiritual energies associated with that element - anyassociated myth or legend. These links form a chain that bindsexperiences from the social, mythic and personal worlds; thatreaches down into the Deep Mind, drawing upon archetypalexperiences, and stimulating the release of energy. Each partof the Centering exercise is enabling you to balance the differ-ent aspects of your self into a more dynamic whole. Each timeyou do this, it is increasingly effective.This first centering exercise, is a preparation for magickalactivity, though of course, it can be done as an exercise initself. If you have a power spot as described earlier, then thiscan be used as your Axis Mundi, and the centering exercisecan be a lot simpler - this is a matter of individual taste andconfidence. Personally, I started out using fairly complex cen-tering rituals & exercises, such as the Lesser Pentagram Ritualmentioned earlier, and then moved to more simpler exercisesas my confidence increased. I’ll go into the use of Power Ob-jects as central axes shortly.After you have performed the main focus of your activity, itis essential to repeat the Centering exercise. Why is this neces-sary? Well, just as when you are doing your trancework,innerworld journey, etc, the last thing you need is being side-tracked by thoughts such as “I wonder what’s on TV later"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"35on?”; its equally undesirable to have a sudden vision from yourwork crop up during your everyday activities (unless of course,you specifically want this to happen). This part of Centeringis known as Grounding yourself - i.e literally bringing your-self ‘back to earth’. A clairvoyant friend told me of a ratherextreme anecdote which illustrates why grounding is a neces-sity. She had been performing some scrying exercises, but hadneglected to ground herself afterwards. Whilst driving to workthe next morning, she glanced briefly into her rearview mirror,and suddenly her mind was flooded with a rush of images ratherlike the hypnagogic images you sometimes see when you arevery tired. Fortunately, she retained control of the car and pulledup, but had she been in rush-hour traffic, the outcome couldhave been nasty!Any kind of magickal work stirs the Deep Mind. Many ex-ercises and techniques allow you to bring one aspect of yourpsyche into the forefront of your awareness. Grounding servesto restore equilibrium, so that you retain your sense of poiseand balance. Periodically, you will probably enter periods ofimbalance - its impossible to grow without doing so. Its im-portant to recognise this when it occurs and open yourself toit, at the same time, there is a difference in totally “drowning”in such an experience, and knowing that it a necessary time togo through - and come out at the other end."},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"36POWER OBJECTSMost magickal systems have physical objects to aid the prac-titioner. In Western magick these are known as Magickal Weap-ons or Tools. In the terminology of modern shamanism, theyare known as Power Objects. They include quartz crystals,instruments such as drums, bullroarers, rattles, and anythingelse the individual shaman uses as an aid. Some Power Ob-jects may be “traditional” - part of the culture, while othersmay be “found objects”. As shamanism has captured the popu-lar imagination, there’s a market been created for “authentic-looking” shamanic artifacts. Which is fine in itself, but caneasily be taken to extremes - like the news recently that somerare species of birds in America are being ruthlessly hunted sothat New Agers can have shamanic objects that look the part.Some people clamour to buy crystals without realising thatthey are imported from third world countries, having been dugout of the rock by underpaid and poorly protected workers.There’s also an assumption that shamanic objects shouldlook ethnic, when in fact, there is much to be said for makingthem yourself, out of what’s available round you. I once saw apicture of a Venezualan shaman’s altar. Amongst the collec-tion of objects was a second world war vintage bayonet, aneighteenth-century cutlass, and a rattle made from an old tincan! We tend to develop fixed ideas about what things ought tolook like. This was illustrated during the Shamanic Develop-ment Course when we came to look at improvised musicalinstruments. When we declared that the next project was tomake at least one musical instrument by the next weekly meet-ing, at least one person turned round and said that this wasn’tpossible - this being, because of their ideas about what consti-tuted a musical instrument. And much the same is true of PowerObjects. It doesn’t really matter what they look like, so long asthey work for you.Some types of Power Objects serve specific functions. The"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"37following examples are taken from different shamanic cultures:The RattleThe Rattle, as mentioned earlier represents, in some cultures,the central axis of the shamanic universe, and is used by theshaman to summon spirits and Gods. The vertical handle ofthe rattle is another version of the world-tree, which the sha-man ascends during trance. The head of the rattle representsthe skyrealm of spirits and ancestors. For some shamanic cul-tures, the rattle also symbolises fire, as a purifying and invigo-rating element, used in healing rituals to counter the heat offevers. An interesting example of the importance of the sacredrattle in a shamanic culture is the Warao Indians of Venezuala.Their sacred rattle (usually a community only possesses onerattle), is not only made out of sacred wood and a gourd whichhas mythic properties and legends associated with them, butthe association with fire is made all the more dramatic as therattle, when whirled vigorously by the shaman, actually emitsa shower of sparks! The wood of the handle is highly combus-tible, and the pebbles and crystals that the rattle’s gourd headcontains rub off fine particles of wood, which are ignited bythe friction of the crystals in the gourd, the sparks flying out ofthe rattle’s mouths.The FluteThe flute turns up in almost all shamanic cultures, made froma variety of substances such as bone, bamboo, reeds and sa-cred woods - often by burning out the inside of a dry stick.They are seen as channels for the voices of spirits and areoften associated with bird-spirits. In some shamanic cultures,flutes have phallic associations (with similar associations tothe wand in Western Magick) and are used in male initiationrituals and rites of passage. For some of the aborigines of NewGuinea, the male-only association of flutes is so strong that itis taboo for women and children to even look at them. In con-trast, for the Thompson River Tribe of North America, thewhistle was a sacred instrument for women, and featured promi-"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"38nently in the rites of passage. Sometimes flutes are five or sixfeet long, and take a great deal of effort to play. Some flutesare paired as ‘male’ and ‘female’, and played against eachother in tribal ceremonies. The ancient Greeks regarded theflute as an instrument of healing, and Democritus recommendedthat the flute be used to cure a whole host of ailments includ-ing snakebite!The DrumA great deal has been written about shamanic drumming. It isone of the most popular ways of entering ecstatic states (apartfrom sex and drugs, that is!). Drums come in all shapes andsizes. made from a wide variety of materials. The rhythmsproduced can propel listeners (and beaters) into trance states,and changes in drum-beats can shift trance awareness to dif-ferent parts of the ritual. Shamanic cultures that employ drum-ming usually have a battery of specific rthymns for ceremo-nial use. Haitian Voudou, for example, has distinct “schools”of drumming associated with particular rituals and deities.Rhythms carry our consciousness along, from heartbeats,to cycles of breathing, sleeping, night-day and the passage ofseasons. rhythms promote associated body movements andadjustments, and act as a signal to begin movement withoutconscious effort, so that less energy is expended when youbegin; for example, it has been shown that soldiers can marchfurther, and in beter form, with less fatigue, when accompa-nied by a marching band. The feeling of being “carried” comesfrom the structure that rhythm gives to our time-sense, andthe pattern gives a sense of continuance. It becomes a motorattitude, and one’s attention is freed (if this is desired). rhythmsalso become “mirrored” by our brain activity, and they alsoaffect heartrate.CrystalsAgain, there’s a lot of material available about crystals, andlike shamanism, they’re very popular at the moment, havingbeen incorporated into therapies and the general lore of the"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"39“New Age”. In Western Magick, crystals are mostly used for‘putting things in’ - the things being, for example, trouble-some entities. Unstable energies can be successfully containedwithin a crystalline structure, and crystals can be easily‘charged’ to accept specific energies. Incidentally, this is whysalt is used as part of cleansing rituals. Salt easily picks uppsychic energy, and when dissolved in water, enables the wa-ter to be more readily charged with energy.For the Huichol shaman, the crystal is an ancestral shaman,returned from the skyworld as solidified light, in order to dwellamongst his kin as a guardian and guiding spirit. This idea, ofthe crystal as condensed spirit is common in many shamaniccultures, from America to Australia. The crystals used in thesacred rattle of the Warao are known as the shaman’s “familyof familiars”.BoneIt is a common shamanic belief that the essential life force orsoul resides not in the flesh, but in the bones. This makes bonea sacred substance much used for the creation of Power Ob-jects, and hunting rituals involving bones are found in allshamanic cultures. Skeletal figures appear in shamanic under-world myths and can be found carved or painted onto instru-ments and costumes. Indian Tantriks made great use of bone,turning it into headresses, bowls, and trumpets made fromhuman thigh-bones.Found ObjectsThe examples given above should give you an idea about thecomplexity of Power Objects. What is obvious is that the sha-man is prepared to utilise any aspect of the environment, giv-ing it a sacred purpose. The philosophy underlying this ap-proach is that the shamanka is on an equal footing with allaspects of her environment - animals, plants, spirits. Human-ity is a participant in the world, rather than being perceived aseperate from it. It is difficult to conceive of the Westernersacting from a similar premise, since part of the attraction of"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"40shamanism for some of us is its promise of return to a primalnaturalness, as opposed to the rampant advance of modernculture, many aspects of which we tend to find abhorrent. Canwe see machines as imbued with a spirit? Can Acid Housepropel us into trance states? We tend to associate shamanismwith the great outdoors (what’s left of it), but since most ofour people live in cities, how does being a shaman help thecommunity? These are questions that it’s easy to shrug off oravoid, but if using shamanic techniques means adopting ashamanic outlook, then that involves looking for the sacred inevery possible place. One way of starting this is by consider-ing Power Objects - things which you either make or find, andin which you place (ceremonially or otherwise) spirits.The most basic form of Power Object is of the lucky rabbit’sfoot variety. This sort of object builds up a talismanic associa-tion - you could say that it holds a spirit which increases yourpersonal power or luck. I used to have a small ceramic piskyfigure, and one day, after reading about Gnomes, decided toimbue this figure with the ability to find things. Rather thandoing a formal ritual, I began to treat the figure as though “he”was a person; politely asking him to find things for me - grate-fully thanking him when the things I’d lost turned up (whichthey invariably began to do), and occasionally giving him bitsof metal, small chips of rock etc, so that a small shrine wasformed; I also greeted him in passing, and kept him dusted.Eventually, when other people started losing things, I’d say tothem “Go ask the Gnome”, and if they humoured me and didso, and the lost item appeared (as it usually did), then I’d tellthem to go and thank him. If they didn’t, he’d get mischeviousand hide things so that they disappeared, turning up later inodd places.If you can adopt the habit of treating what we usually thinkof as inanimate objects as independent entities - perhaps ashomes for spirits, they you might be surprised as to how yourrelationship to them changes. The example above is only oneway of ‘placing’ a spirit into an object. Different schools ofmagick have different approaches, depending on the complex-"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"41ity of the cosmology, but it’s generally held to be a good ideathat if you’re going to place spirits into objects, then treatingthem with due respect and reverence is the way to go about it.Try treating all the tools you use as though a spirit inhabitsthem, and see what difference it makes to how you use them.Don’t be dogmatic about this - burning incense near a com-puter for instance, will not give pleasing results! Of course,not all tools need a spirit in them - perhaps just the ones wetend to personalise - like cars, for instance. The tools you useas Power Objects are extensions of yourself and your chosencosmology, and you will benefit greatly from treating them asliving entities, imbued with a certain amount of their own vo-lition. It is not unknown, for example, for Power Objects ofgreat antiquity to have their own familiars, having acquired agreat deal of Mythic significance from their owners, and yearsof use. Shamans around the world often sing and offer gifts totheir Power Objects, and it is a good habit (and one that paysoff!) to get into."},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"42DRAWING THREADS TOGETHERAll the techniques in this book can be used as separate exer-cises, but to draw things to a conclusion, here is an example ofhow different ways of exploring each world can be combinedinto a process of exploration - drawing threads together andweaving them back and forth to form a whole. The followingexample is developed from the as yet unpublished work ofNeil McLachlan.One of the simplest, and yet profound explorations is theunderstanding of how we relate to the basic elements of theuniverse: Fire, Air, Water, Earth, and that which is knownvariously as spirit, tao, or void. On the circle (itself a symbolof totality) the four elements are related to the four cardinaldirections - South, East, West and North), and the fifth ele-ment, to the centre. What follows is a series of exercises, work-ing in each of the three worlds, to develop an awareness, andunderstanding of each element, and of the whole.The first steps would be to gather together the correspon-dences of each element, given in books. After which, you couldmeditate upon each element, attempting to recognise in whichways, by what qualities, each element contributed to you as aperson - how do you relate the element of air and its qualitiesfor example, and so on. In so doing, you are relating the con-cept of the elements to your Personal world, and you mightfind the technique of Scrying useful in helping you meditate onthe elements. From these insights, you could develop a Shield(or even a series of shields) showing how the elements relatewithin you - for example, a circle divided into 4 elements withspirit at the centre and beyond the circumference. The shield(s)can be as simple or complex as you wish, and you may want tokeep developing them.The next step is to get to know each element in turn, and forthis part, you will need to be aware of Power Spots. You couldfind places where one of the elements is predominant, such as"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"43an exposed place on a windy day for air; a beach or spitheadof land where you can feel the power of water; a place whereyou can build a fire undisturbed for fire; and for earth, a moun-tain, hillside or fertile valley. The fifth element void, is a littleabstract, but a quiet indoor place, or an outdoor place whereyou can see the night stars should suffice. These are the placesto open yourself to the elements, to let drop all your precon-ceived ideas about them (what elementals look like and so forth)and let the feeling of them flood through you. Try and ‘be-come’ the element, soaking yourself in what you feel to be itsqualities, and let your mind wander to find all the ways inwhich that element appears, all the ways you know of, yourearliest recollections of them. For example, look into your fireand recall candle flames, garden bonfires, volcanoes, factoryflames. Everything from primordial fire kept alive in a cave tothe nuclear fire caught within a reactor. Be aware, again, ofhow the element appears in your life. For spirit, or void, thinkof all the various ways in which this element is expressed, inworld religions and icons, and feel it as a deep centre withinyourself and everything else. the source of all. Do this at eachplace you have chosen as being appropriate.The next step is to seek a Power Object to condense yourexperience of each element into a solid form. To do this, youmight return to each of your places of meditation, and askeach element to provide you with a token or gift. Again, youshould be open to Omens here. The token may appear as a‘found object’ or be given by someone, or attract your eyefrom a shop window. How it comes doesn’t matter, but thatyou are aware that this is something special. An earth tokenmight be, for example, a pebble or a bought crystal, while youmight find some bird feathers lying across your path one dayfor air. A lump of fire-charred wood (which can be varnishedlater) might be your token for fire, while a seashell or piece ofdriftwood may be given to you for water.For the void - well, a unique or black object might turn up,or your token could be a meditative state - a feeling of calm-ness, which you come to recognise, and learn to feel drawingupon you."},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"44Once you have your five Power Objects, the next step is toreturn to your elemental places and fuse the experience of theplace with the object. You can do this by again letting the ex-periences of each element flood through you, but holding thetoken so that the energies pass through you into the token.From now on, the five Power Objects will act as gates be-tween yourself, and the five elemental energies. You could utiliseeach token by creating a Pathworking based on some of thefeelings and images that are compressed into each token. Youcan use them as the points markers in a Centering exercise, orby selecting two complementary qualities for each element,such as gentleness and strength, for earth, incorporate theminto your self as qualities which you wish to express. Finally,in group work, you could use your enhanced perception of theelements in devising means of expressing them - through dance,games, playlets, mimes, and soundscapes. In doing all of this,you will not only balance yourself in terms of those elements,but also increase your awareness of the worlds about you,within you, behind you, and beyond you. You can go on toexplore the relationships between elements in the physicalworld, in the world of human society, and in the myriad ofmyths which we have access to.
