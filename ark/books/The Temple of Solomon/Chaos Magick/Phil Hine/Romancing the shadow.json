Today I talk about getting government off ourbacks. I dream of a world where someday, you can buy liquor, cigarettes andfirearms at a drive-thru window and use them all before you get home. Basically,anything that gets rid of people is okay with me. But before you go, buy my newbook.\"Seven years of highly defective people, Scott AdamsIt'd be too easy to write off \"The Psychopath's Bible\" (TPB) as a cynical attempt tocash in on the insecurities of all those death-metal wannabe neitzchian 'supermen'out there, or the sort of people who read Anthony Robbins books but don't have acorporate culture with which to put it all into practice. There’s a little more to itthan that, however.American dreamtimeTo begin, there's that highly charged term, \"Psychopath\". Just reading the title,The Psychopath's Bible is evocative for the reader, firing up mental/emotionalassociations, which will inform a person's reading of the text even before they getto page 1. From a clinician's point of view, the term \"psychopath\" is complex–some psychiatrists are tending to favour the terms \"sociopath\" or \"anti-socialpersonality\" for describing such individuals. But \"The Anti-Social Personality'sBible\" just doesn't have the same ring, does it? Nor would it draw on the sameemotive power that \"psychopath\" has for us. Aha. I just wrote \"individual\", didn'tI? America, like no other Western culture, has a deep fascination (evenidentification) with a particular 'ideal type' of individual - the rebel - the 'outsider'- it's something very close to the core of the American Dream, from the lonefrontiersmen who tamed the 'wild west' to the contemporary business magnatewho shapes a dream into a multi-billion dollar company. The figure (or spectre) ofthe psychopath is, arguably, the 'shadow' of the American fascination withextreme individualism. The most obvious way that this is expressed is in film, andwe don't have to look far into Hollywood's (dream-America's akashic records?)output to find many examples. Hyatt himself provides a film guide to onscreenpsychopaths. The most obvious ones are the demonic killers, but there arepsychopathic elements to superheroes (check out Alan Moore's Watchmen andFrank Miller's Batman: The Dark Knight Returns for graphical novels dealing withthe 'darker' side of the American superhero), the femme fatale, the ruthlesscorporate player (organised crime, politics, business), and even the occasionalcomic figure. In fact, the more you examine American film-culture, the more'psychopathic' types turn up.Films do not merely present psychopathic personalities; they draw us towardsthem, perhaps invoking feelings of empathy or compassion towards them.Watching the psychopathic characters in \"Silence of the Lambs\" projects us intotheir world - a glimpse of the world through their eyes - affording a degree ofempathy which is often unnerving for the viewer (and also a degree of irony, asone of the clinical features of the psychopath is their marked inability toempathise with others).Defining the psychopath?In the introduction to TPB, Nicholas Tharcher cites both the World HealthOrganisation’s classification of “Dissocial (Antisocial) Personality Disorder” and theAmerican DSM-IV classification of “Antisocial Personality Disorder.” The readermight very well make the assumption that these classifications are ‘fixed’ andtherefore are generally reliable. Unfortunately, when digging deeper into thepsychiatric literature, one finds that matters are not so clear-cut. There is a greatdeal of debate around the terms psychopath, sociopath, and Antisocial PersonalityDisorder and the related clinical classifications. In the UK, for example, the term‘psychopath’ only exists as a legal definition in the 1983 Mental Health Act:"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Articles : Phil Hinehttp://occultebooks.com/essays/phil/tyranny.htm2 of 61/25/2007 1:48 PMSection 1(2) \"psychopathic disorder is a persistent disorder or disability of mind(whether or not including significant impairment of intelligence) which results inabnormally aggressive or severely irresponsible conduct.\"Unsurprisingly, this legal vagueness has been widely criticised by researchers,clinicians and legislators. An extensive study into the issues relating to personalitydisorders completed in 1999 at Ashworth Special Hospital concluded (amongstmany other findings) that “psychopathic disorder” is a redundant term”.The origins of ‘Psychopath’ as a clinical term date back to the mid-nineteenthcentury. In the early 1950s, the American Psychological Association (APA)dropped it in favour of ‘sociopath’, following a growing argument that psychopathywas an exclusively social, rather than mental maladjustment. However, it isargued that psychopath and sociopath are not synonymous terms, and that thesociopath is defined in terms of overt criminal behaviour – habitually violatingsocial norms and failing to learn from prior experience. In 1968, the APA wheeled out a new term – Antisocial Personality Disorder –largely defined in terms of repeated violations of social norms, and used inDSM-III (1980), DSM-IIIR (1987) and DSM-IV (1994).This was an attempt toencompass the earlier definitions of psychopath and sociopath into a collectivepersonality disorder that could be tested and measured. One of the reasons forthis shift in emphasis was that previous classifications of psychopathy werecouched in terms of personality traits, which are difficult to measure reliably.Hence DSM-IV’s classification of the Antisocial Personality relies heavily onbehavioural indicators, as it’s easier to agree on the behaviours that typify adisorder, than the causes of a disorder. DSM-IV has been heavily criticised, bothin terms of specific classifications and its general approach to psychiatricconditions. One major criticism of DSM-IV’s classifications is that they areartifactual rather than empirical. With respect to psychopathy, DSM-IV’sclassification of Anti-Social Personality Disorder (ASPD) has been criticised by Dr.Robert Hare, Professor of Psychology at the University of British Columbia. Haremaintains that there is a difference between individuals classified under thecriteria of ASPD and psychopaths. he says that whilst most psychopaths ‘fit’ thecriteria for ASPD, not all those who ‘fit’ the criteria for ASPD are psychopaths.Medical Psychologist Michael G. Conner helpfully summarises Hare’s indicators ofpsychopathy as:A psychopath can have high verbal intelligence, but they typically lack \"emotionalintelligence\". They can be expert in manipulating others by playing to theiremotions. There is a shallow quality to the emotional aspect of their stories (i.e.,how they felt, why they felt that way, or how others may have felt and why). Thelack of emotional intelligence is the first good sign you may be dealing with apsychopath. A history of criminal behavior in which they do not seem to learnfrom their experience, but merely think about ways to not get caught is thesecond best sign. ... Psychopathy involves poor emotional intelligence, the lack ofconscience, and an inability to feel attached to people except in terms of theirvalue as a source of stimulation or new possessions. There are many expressionsand forms of psychopathy.Research based on Hare’s model of psychopathy has led to a more complexunderstanding of the psychopathic personality that belies some of the popularassumptions. As TPB points out, ‘popular’ definitions of the psychopath emphasizeimpulsiveness and lack of control. However, research indicates that somepsychopaths are adept at controlling their tempers and appear as though theyhave everything under control, appearing ‘calm and collected’. Rather thanexhibiting an explosive temperament, they are more apt to be outgoing andcharming, displaying a high degree of verbal skills (and thus being able to talkthemselves out of trouble). Studies of Psychopath’s conversations indicate though,that their speech content tends to take the form of stock phrases, repetitions ofthe same ideas, idiosyncratic jargon & terminology, and logical inconsistencies.Another characteristic of psychopaths is emotional flatness. Although psychopathsare excellent actors – able to mimic appropriate emotions skilfully, they areunable to experience emotional depth. As one researcher put it [psychopaths]“know the words but not the music.”Hare has produced diagnostic tools such as the PCL-R – Psychopathy Checklist(revised) that have gained widespread use in North America as aids for assessingpsychopathic personality disorder. Interestingly, there appears to have been littlecross-cultural research into its relevance to the assessment of psychopathy inother countries. It’d be too simplistic too assume that what defines a psychopathin North America is going to be globally applicable, just as some cultures havevery different attitudes to Western societies to the expression of individualism.Whilst TPB asserts that “Most Toxick Magicians are made, not born” (p23), there isa growing body of psychiatric research that suggests that for psychopaths, it’s theother way round, and that psychopathic traits are not so much the result of poor"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Articles : Phil Hinehttp://occultebooks.com/essays/phil/tyranny.htm3 of 61/25/2007 1:48 PMsocialisation, but reflect neurobiological abnormalities.Rather more germane to this discussion is Hare’s contention (see his book,Without Conscience) that some psychopathic ‘traits’ – such as egocentricity, lackof concern for others, emotional detachment and manipulation – are not onlytolerated, but valued. It is to this idea that I will now turn.As long as we're talking shelf-lifeAt this point I have to pose the question, \"how much of an 'outsider' is thepsychopath? The 'popular' view (i.e. popular culture) is that they are very much'outsiders' - objects of fascination and repulsion. But they're everywhere, andthere's a vast amount of media given over to them - not only film, but alsoliterature, graphic novels, etc. Then there's all the psychological stuff - rangingfrom the popular to the learned papers - and the adulation of 'leaders' in business& politics, many of whom can be seen to be 'psychopathic (more of which in amoment). Not to mention the occult literature on 'antinomian' god-forms and thelike. So are psychopaths really that 'shocking'? We may be shocked by their acts(particularly those who's tastes run to murder and violence) but outsiders? Notreally. The fact that many people can fantasise about being \"psychopaths\" (Andone suspects that this is an attraction for some of the people who might buy TPB)shows that they are a 'safe' form of outsider. Not necessarily applauded, but to acertain degree, accepted. The real outsiders of 21st-century western culture - thepeople who just on mention, invoke the strongest emotion of loathing and fear -are the paedophiles. Just as insidious as the psychopaths. But more invisible, andas far as I know at least, no one has tried elevating them to the status ofanti-heroes. A case in point, here, is the reaction to Judith Levine’s new book,Harmful to Minors: The Perils of Protecting Children from Sex, published by theUniversity of Minnesota Press. In April of last year, a campaign was launched byAmerican conservatives, (including a candidate for the state governorship), toprevent the book even seeing publication. Within a month, Minnesota StateGovernor Jesse Ventura received over 19,000 emails demanding that the book bequashed and those responsible for it fired – before the book had even made it tothe shops and people could actually find out what it was about.It's a question of degree, really. One might think of Satanists as 'outsiders' - andto some people they are 'demonic' figures, but with high-profile groups such asthe Church of Satan and Satanic funerals being held for U.S. military personnel,their 'outsider' status is weakened considerably. And I think it's much the samefor \"psychopaths\". The very fact that New Falcon can release TPB without havingit seized immediately and Dr. Hyatt universally reviled shows that the figure of thepsychopath as an object of fear and hate has lost it's top-slot status. If such abook had been released when 'psychopathic' serial-killers were big in the newsand had 'real' bogeyman status, it'd probably have been a very different story.Corporate psychopaths?I promised earlier to look at psychopathic types in modern business, as I feel thisis an important element of the overall picture I am painting. Business leadershave always been an integral part of the American Dream, yet until recently, theywere just businessmen - faceless CEOs or reclusive magnates. Over the lastdecade or so, they've become superstars as never before, not only applauded forbeing successful, but also actively sought out for their views on what traditionallyhave been non-business matters. Now they are held up as visionaries, withmessages which are not only important for business but for society at large. Theyare much-admired, emulated and analysed by consultants and writers of 'personaleffectiveness' manuals. So how are they ‘psychopathic’?Michael Maccoby, writing in the Harvard Business Review (Jan-Feb 2000) talksabout \"Narcissistic Leaders\" - examples he gives being Bill Gates (Microsoft), PehrGyllenhammer (ex-Volvo) and Jan Carlzon (ex-SAS). Narcissistic leaders have twostrengths, which are often associated with being 'great' leaders: they have acompelling vision, and the charisma to attract followers. However, there are anumber of problems. Narcissistic leaders need affirmation from their followers -preferably adulation. Secondly, narcissists tend to be isolated, dismissing cautionand advice from others. Rather than attempting to persuade those who disagree,the narcissist tends to ignore them. They only listen to the kind of informationthey seek, and don't easily learn from others. They prefer indoctrination or controlto teaching. They also tend to shun emotions, and given their own difficulty withknowing or acknowledging their own feelings, they tend to be extremelyuncomfortable with other people expressing theirs - particularly negative feelings.They cannot tolerate dissent, bruise easily, and can easily become paranoid. Somenarcissists are so defensive that they actually make a virtue of the fact that theydo not listen to others. Whilst narcissists often crave empathy from others, theydo not, on the whole express empathy for others. Whilst narcissistic leaders oftensay that they want teamwork, what that means in practice is that they want agroup of yes-men. Narcissists see no reason to change their behaviour, and aslong as they are 'successful', they don't have to. This portrait has telling"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Articles : Phil Hinehttp://occultebooks.com/essays/phil/tyranny.htm4 of 61/25/2007 1:48 PMsimilarities to the behaviours often associated with the psychopath:Psychopaths (from Hare, 1993) Narcissistic leaders (from Maccoby)Grandiose sense of self worth Driven to achieve power and recognitionlack of remorse or guilt callous/lack of empathy shallow emotional responsepathological lying lack empathy with others, rarely have any regrets, and caneasily direct downsizing, layoffs, destructive cost cutting and other relatedinitiatives.conning/manipulative They are poor learners and prefer to convert others to theirway of thinkingneed for stimulation/prone to boredom They are often ruthless competitorspoor behavioural controls impulsivity, irresponsibility They are poor listeners andtend to overreact to criticismlack of realistic long term goals glibness/superficial charmMaccoby highlights the case of Jan Carlzon former CEO of Scandinavian Air Lines(SAS) as a 'classic' of narcissistic leadership. In the 1980's, Carlzon achieved gurustatus amongst business analysts - Tom Peters (author of \"Thriving on Chaos\")called him a 'model leader'. Carlzon followed his own vision for SAS and ignoredboth his advisors and subordinates. Seduced by the flattery he received in theinternational press and the euphoria of his own success, he believed he could dono wrong. He threw money into acquiring hotels and made a high investment inContintental Airways mere months before they filed for Chapter 11 (protectedbankruptcy). Carlzon was fired as CEO and SAS lost their 'glamour' as a 'model'company (although both they and Continental are still going strong). Carlzon maywell have been kicking over the traces within SAS, but he was probably followinga general trend at the time of European carriers attempting to expand into theAmerican market - all of these ventures failed, possibly due to the significantdifferences between how the airline industry works in America as opposed toEurope. Some analysts believe though, that there was an element of transferencein there too - European companies trying to acquire the 'success' they perceivedin the American business model. It used to be the Japanese who set the pace inbusiness culture innovation - until the Asian economy crashed and burned. Thenthe Americans took over, and companies desperate for 'success' try looking atmore successful ones and emulating what they do - which has had the effect ofpromoting the \"Narcissistic Leader\" style even further.EnronomicsThe recent problems in America with the WorldCom, Xerox & Enron scandals haveshown up the cracks in the promotion of this style of leadership. When companiesdevelop a culture of ruthless, relentless competition, this can easily becomearrogance - the \"take no prisoners\" approach where winning at any costs runsthroughout the company. J. Timothy McMahon, a professor of management at theUniversity of Houston comments:\"...winning big and fast was at the core of Enron's culture. Reward systemsencouraged this short-term view. Progressively better quarterly earnings andhigher stock prices would be attained -- obviously, in any way possible.\"and:\"I have yet to hear or read one word of regret from either Skilling or Fastow[directors of Enron] -- no sign of empathy for employees who lost their jobs andretirement funds or for others who experienced staggering financial losses.\"These high-profile scandals have rocked America, but what needs to be addressedat some point is how such a destructive business culture developed in the firstplace. It's not exactly an unknown quality, as ruthless business figures have beenwell portrayed in Hollywood (Gordon Gekko in \"Wall Street\" is a good example).My contention is that there's an element of the American-based love of the ruggedindividual - the 'successful' outsider that has what can be characterised as a'psychopathic' element. The \"take no prisoners\" approach to life and the desire tocontrol and manipulate others to one's own benefit can equally be discerned inBandler & Grinder's works on NLP and the work of authors such as AnthonyRobbins. There are various shades of this tendency in occult literature as well - anarena that is perfect for controlling, manipulative individuals to thrive in.Work to win?Maybe this would be a good point to take a closer look at the personaldevelopment (PD) ethos, as it seems to me that it does fit well with thediscussion, particularly in terms wider issues of ‘control’ at a cultural level – again,something which Hyatt deals with in TPB. Authors such as Anthony Robbins &Stephen Covey (Seven habits...) are not only dealing with techniques for personaldevelopment, they are also promoting a particular set of values – an ethos, if youlike, of what constitutes ‘successful’ human behaviour. If you read PD-style books,"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Articles : Phil Hinehttp://occultebooks.com/essays/phil/tyranny.htm5 of 61/25/2007 1:48 PMseveral key idea float to the surface: setting goals (which are used as a form ofsecular prayer); optimising time (‘what are you doing right now which brings youcloser to your goal’); choosing suitable role models (PD ‘visionaries’ tend to be‘successful’ CEOs); flexibility (use what works to achieve your goal, discard whatdoesn’t); stability (continual progress towards one’s goal); hard work (for PDpundits, industry is almost a goal in itself); results (PD places a great emphasis onbeing able to state clearly how whatever one has done in a given period helpsachieve the desired-for goal). In PD terms, becoming ‘successful’ in the worldrests on achieving clarity and certainty. One states ones’ highest goal, and thenmoves towards it, excluding anything (and anyone) that isn’t relevant to achievingthat goal. This doesn’t sound too dissimilar from some of the ideas in the TPB, butmore importantly, the PD ethos reflects both a dominant cultural trend – theapplication of work-values into what traditionally were seen as non-work areas(lifestyle, leisure, ‘spirituality’) and the overall Protestant Ethic as discussed byMax Weber. The PD values are the values of modern business enterprises appliedto the individual’s personal life – so that life becomes permeated with visions,goal-setting, developing strategies, projects, and regular auditing. Although theseideas have been restated into modern (PD) parlance, they are not in themselves,particularly new. Pekka Himanen (The Hacker Ethic and the Spirit of theInformation Age, Vintage 2001) points out that these values are very similar tothose expounded by Benjamin Franklin, and even earlier, those of ChristianMonastic teachings. In other words, it’s the values of the Protestant Work Ethicencroaching into all spheres of life. Winning is work and work is about winning.This can be seen in the way that traditional leisure activities get talked about –hobbies, sports activities, etc., become forms of ‘work’ (look at the way hobbiesget turned into ‘work’ by CV experts – sports are good to put on CVs as they showyou’re competitive, and a ‘team player’) and, as I have noted in Prime Chaos,there’s a very strong Protestant Ethic undercurrent in developing magical skills –the view that magical development requires hard work, struggle, and personaldiscipline, almost to the extent that all the ‘fun’ gets leeched out of it.In one sense at least, The Psychopath’s Bible is a clever articulation of aspects ofAmerican culture that are readily discernable, though perhaps not explicitlyarticulated. If Dr. Hyatt had released his material aimed at the kind of people whobuy books with titles like \"Seven habits of highly effective people\" it's possiblethat no one would have batted an eyelid. Aiming it at occultists however, wasperhaps a little cruel. The book also has that rare quality of being thoughtprovoking, which in itself is rare enough to make it worth a few re-readings.To sum up, then, my contention here is that the ‘psychopath’ and the worldviewassociated with that ‘ideal type’ are not really as outré – at least in terms ofcultural imperatives – as one might initially suppose. On closer examination, onefinds that there are elements of American culture that do much to support andvalidate that perspective. After all, the behavioural characteristics generallyassociated with psychopaths that seem to hold an attraction – autonomy,emotional distance, detachment, becoming an ‘alpha individual’, control andmanipulation of others, etc., are very strong cultural messages in modern society,particularly for men. Charlene Spretnak (States of Grace, 1991) sums this upquite neatly:“For anyone whose identity is entwined with the patriarchal project ofseparateness and reactive autonomy – which is a personal choice, not a matter ofbiological determinism – the cultural history of the West could indeed be viewedas a triumphant progression towards the unencumbered strutting of the existentialLone Cowboy.”In a similar manner to the PD ethos of ‘success’ using corporate strategies, theidea of identifying with the psychopath provides the lure of clarity andsingle-mindedness of purpose, obviating any requirement to confront thecomplexities and ambiguities of modern culture. After all, misanthropy meansnever having to say you’re sorry.coda: Is the psychopath passé?One problem with TPB is that it's very focus - the desirability of exploring andutilising that psychopathic world-view is both culture and time-bound. Some haveargued that the Hollywood interest in the psychopath as anti-hero peaked in the1990's, and may now be on the decline. In the wake of Enron et al, George Bushhas been mouthing terms like \"integrity\" and \"conscience\" in terms of businessethics, but at the moment it's difficult to tell whether this is merely anass-covering exercise or a the beginning of a serious sea-change in howAmericans think about business - and by extension - about the individual. Theresearch into the phenomenon of narcissistic leaders is going hand-in-hand withthe concept of \"Emotional Intelligence\" - which involves factors such asself-awareness, self-regulation, empathy and social skills - and there are somestudies which indicate that, where 'leaders' embody these skills, their companiesare more 'successful' than those with narcissists at the helm. These views are"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Articles : Phil Hinehttp://occultebooks.com/essays/phil/tyranny.htm6 of 61/25/2007 1:48 PMstarting to filter out into wider American culture, and it's possible (though by nomeans probable) that they could in time, shift the view of the psychopath fromruthless winner to dysfunctional pariah. There's also some new clinical research,which is questioning the popular image of the psychopath as lacking empathy andfeelings for others. Dr. Willem Martens (Psychiatric Times, Vol.XIX/Issue1) arguesthat:\"Psychopaths are at least periodically aware of the effects of their behaviour onothers and can be genuinely saddened by their inability to control it.\"and:\"Despite their outward arrogance, inside psychopaths feel inferior to others andknow they are stigmatised by their own behaviour. Although some psychopathsare superficially adapted to their environment and are even popular, they feelthey must carefully hide their true nature because it will not be accepted byothers. This leaves psychopaths with a difficult choice: adapt and participate in anempty, unreal life, or do not adapt and live a lonely life isolated from the socialcommunity. They see the love and friendship others share and feel dejectedknowing they will never take part in it.\"Martens makes the point that her studies of psychopaths have indicated acorrelation between the intensity of sadness and loneliness experienced by apsychopath and the degree of recklessness and impulsivity. She also points outthat, over the last decade or so, there has been a good deal of advancement inthe neurobiological understanding of some of the 'traits' associated withpsychopathology and suggests that a combination of psychotherapy,psychopharmacological and/or neurofeedback treatments may be effective intreating psychopaths.As one of the attractions of the psychopath in popular culture is their seeming‘inhumanity’ and distance from other people (i.e. ‘superiority’), research such asthis could put a serious kink in their perceived attractiveness as ideal ‘outsiders’.
