Itís not really atraining manual like its predecessors, but gives one viewpoint(mine) on tackling the problem of living and acting from abroadly shamanic stance, within a city culture. Starting out withthe premise that shamanic work is less of a purely personal tripand more related to the recovery of a functional role thatindividuals may come to play in their community, I have triedto present a clear picture of my own approach, in the hope thatit may point others to explore what remains, largely, unknownterritory.This book does not offer any prescriptive solutions to theproblems it highlights - we tend to look for easy solutions toproblems almost before weíve fully grasped whatís going on.Iím more interested in the development of approaches tosituations, which ultimately, gives a more flexible approach.Magick, for me, is a way of enhancing survival in ourenvironment, whether it be open countryside or inner city. Thereis a race of gnomes, so the story goes, who believe that nothingis possible; and there is a sect of magicians who believe thateverything is. Shamanism in its original form developed fromearly human approaches to survival and evolution. We seem tohave reached a point in our collective story where we mustmake a drastic evolutionary leap, in order to continue. Shamanictechniques, and a broad, shamanic outlook can help us here.Some sections of this book are to be taken as ëatmosphericítext, as some of the sense that Iím trying to put over can only besidled up to sideways. Also, there isnít space here to describe allthe different techniques Iím discussing, so itís up you to do somefollow-up work. Itís worth bearing in mind that itís taken me 14years of magickal training, group work, academic work and"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"6constant activity to get to the point of writing this, and half thetime I still feel like a novice in new territory."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"7Personal Reflections on Urban ShamanismBack in í87, I wrote a brief article for Moonshine on the subjectof ëurban shamanismí, tentatively asking the question Can webe Urban Shamans?î - and if so, how do you go about it?Three years on and Iíve managed to glean a few personalanswers, only to find yet more questions waiting in the wings.One option is to become involved with the weekend workshopscene - first as a learner, then as a trainer. It seems to help if youtrain under someone whoís a ënameí, and then pick up a fewcredentials such as ëfourth gateway pipe-carrierí, then go an getan alternative therapy qualification, add the magic wordìshamanicî to your practice, and away you go. Itís also worthconsidering a name-change; anything with the words ëcrystalí,ërainbowí, or ëMoondancerí in it is a safe bet. Moving to Londonor Glastonbury is also worth thinking about, since there probablyisnít much call for chakra masseurs in Batley!The current ëglamourí of shamanism has a very ethnic glossto it. Reading between the lines one can feel the search for asense of stability, permanence, or connection with the past; whilstaround us the rate of social change seems to accelerate everyday. No longer psychically bound to our cultural landscape, wecan choose from myriad shards of belief, from the wisdom basedon historical traditions, to the myths of rehashed/recoveredknowledge. Our society is becoming too big for us to handle, asindividuals. The total symbolisation of the environment meansthat we are rapidly approaching information overload, whilstthe social control systems of culture are fast becoming trulyesoteric. In the midst of all this chaos, it is easy to understandand share the yearning for a simpler existence, where all is, atleast, potentially apprehendable.The other way to developing a shamanic stance is to burrowyour way into a community and become a ëusefulí person."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"8ëUsefulí people are those who everyone else tells you to go andsee when youíve a particular problem, be it blocked drains, theDSS, or ìthereís something ëorrible lurking in the cellar - whatdo you think it is?î Itís surprising how many people haveëpsychicí or otherwise unexplainable experiences that they donítlet out to just anyone, for fear of incredulity or perhaps, toomuch credulity from others. Many people tend to view theirexperiences of the weird as signs of possible aberration - if youcan assure them that this isnít so; that ìit happens all the timeî(perhaps relating a similar incident that you know about), thenyouíre well on your way to becoming a ëuseful personí. I recallthat one of my first ëbig breaksí at being classed as ëusefulí bymy peers came up over a well-known haunted house. I heardtales of moving carpets, banging doors & creeping presenceson the stairs; and promptly stayed the night there with itís soleremaining resident. Word must have spread on the grapevine,as people started to seek me out (not in droves, mind you) tocome and look at the things in their flats & houses; do Tarotreadings, and generally talk about the intrusions of the uncannyinto their lives. I wonít pretend itís a living, ëcos it isnít, but it isrewarding in the sense of making connections, learning andoccasionally, getting into sticky situations.Occasionally things do get nasty. One of my friends wassubjected to a week of threatening telephone calls, and thenreceived a really nasty curse object through the post. How doyou deal with this one? Well the obvious thing to do is somekind of protection for those involved, backed up by what wemight call magickal (oh all right then, ëshamanicí...) counselling;what they can do to protect themselves, how the curse operatesand what signs to look out for, and finally, dealing with thecurse itself, and, if you can find them, the perpetrators. Again,thereís more of this sort of thing going on than you might expect,and while most of it is done by amateurs, that doesnít mean tosay it isnít effective.Psychic Attack is another example. Most psychic attack is self-induced, meaning that someone thinks that the black lodge downthe road is sending malign blasts at them (goddess knows why),which eventually becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy, even if the"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"9black lodge turn out to out not to exist after all. From myexperience, it seems that most psychic attack, like rape and childabuse, is carried out by people who are known to the victim;such as ex-, or even current lovers. Itís not enough being able torecognise the signs, you should know the methods of dealingwith it as well. It can be life-threatening, especially if someoneis becoming suicidal, or so confused that they step out in frontof a car one day. Something which occasionally crops up, andmay well be on the increase, is pagans being prayed over inrelays by groups of born-again fundamentalists. A variant ispeople who get involved with some form of occultism orpaganism (or indeed any lifestyle that parents or ëfriendsí findthreatening) and find themselves being prayed over, exorcised,and generally told that they are possessed by the the devil. Ormad. In my book, this amounts to psychic attack just as much ashaving a poppet of yourself prodded with pins - having yournewly-found belief system or self-image forcefully battered bysomeone who is 110% sure that theyíre right and you needsaving can lead to severe trauma.This probably sounds like racy stuff, but its all happening outthere. Magick is alive and well and being practised in the suburbs,squats, and housing estates. Thereís an infinite plurality ofapproach, which is partly why I donít stick to one systemexclusively - having an eclectic approach, and being adaptableto new situations is more useful for me.Healing takes up a large part of my ëworkí, and is usually themost difficult. There are some things I can do, and some thingsI canít, and its usually a wise move to say to someone that youdonít know the fine details of a subject, but can possiblyrecommend someone who does. Having a background inallopathic medicine helps here, as in the case of people whowant to know more about the drugs theyíve been prescribed, orthe drugs theyíve acquired in other ways. Healing tends toinvolve counselling, trance induction, working with bodyenergies, teaching relaxation & centering exercises, getting spiritsto take care of specific problems, and occasionally, ritual work.Different clients respond to different approaches - some respondbetter to full-blown ritual, while others prefer light trance work"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"10with minimal trappings. Of course, much depends on thesituation & the problem.The flipside of shamanic work is dealing out retribution ofone kind or another. Historically, and in existing shamaniccultures, itís accepted that the shaman/ka occasionally has toroll up their sleeves and get stuck into a situation thatís, shall wesay, murky. Turning curses back onto the people who sent themout in the first place is the prime example. The occult is full ofpeople who think they can get away with anything, and do,until someone else puts their foot down. Letís take an example.A friend of mine had his car stolen. It was recovered, but thethieves had taken some items which had great sentimental value.He wanted me to throw a scare into them - not a smoking bootjob or anything, but to impress on them that stealing cars wasnot a nice thing to do. In the end, I set up the situation so thathe was the one who gave the thieves a fright by turning up intheir dreams. Anyone whoís gasping in horror reading thisshould be aware that this sort of incident is rare - but thenagain, people in our community tend to stick up for one another.If Iím asked to help out in a situation, I will, and consider it myfunction in the community. Many situations are unsavoury, butby steadying each other through the bad times, we learn toappreciate the good times even more. All the same, such activitiesshould never be undertaken lightly.For me, the basics of the urban shamanic approach requirean ability to adapt in the face of necessity. When walking into anew situation, like as not armed only with my thunderbolt, tarot,and notepad, I try and find my ëpoint of powerí from which toact - the role I will play in the unfolding of events: upfrontsupport or backstage prompt. Once I have found the point fromwhich to work, I try and stick to it - knowing that thatís the bestway for me to influence the situation (of course itís rarely thatsimple). What I can actually do in a given situation is partlydefined by my clients. A first step is to look for possible loopholesin what, on the face of it, is a no-win situation. Extreme situationsusually require extreme strategies, and people are generally moreinterested in results than intellectual niceties.As I have said, I donít use just one approach to shamanic"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"11magick - I use whatever seems necessary to get the job done.This colours my writing, and Iím far more interested in puttingacross the general understanding of a subject than describingprescriptive solutions. This is because situations will alwaysoutstrip existing prescriptions. The complexity of working in acity easily outstrips current magical realities. They may be greatfor connecting you with a sense of continued tradition, puttingyou back in contact with inner wisdom, natural cycles, or eternalarchetypes, but often, they donít help you deal with the wildcards thrown up at you by the urban jungle. Example: A 23year old junkie who desperately needs to detox before her heartquits on her asks you to help her ìmagicallyî. Any goodanswers?; Iíd like to hear them, ëcos exorcising a house is peanutscompared with human problems. Meeting up with other peopleíshorrors is instructive - it stops you dramatising your own innerconflicts into cosmic catastrophes.Intervention can of itself, become an addiction. Eventuallyyouíll fetch up with a situation that no matter what you do, youcanít do anything to help out. Trying only makes it worse. Onceyou manage to convince yourself that youíre a shaman, healeror whatever, and continue to feed that smug little thought, thenwatch out. You may go rushing in and unwittingly screw thingsup even more. An acquaintance got addicted to giving hugs.Everyone got big, jolly, reassurance hugs. Now donít get mewrong, I like a good hug myself, but itís not always appropriate,especially when the personís body language is screaming ìDoníttouch me.î Look before you leap in; at the situation, the people,and yourself.Information-gathering is of prime importance. You can neverhave too much of it. Iíll talk to anyone or anything, from familiarspirits to social workers, if it will give me a clearer picture orthrow up a different slant. All data is potentially valuable, evenif, on the surface, itís got nothing to do with the matter in hand.Our cities are myths; constantly rewriting themselves andspawning our demons; incest, rape, child abuse, drugs, poverty.Besides these ëbeingsí, anything you can tempt into a porta-triangle is nothing by comparison. Yet we donít seem to have amagical approach to the complexities of city-life. Weíve hardly"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"12begun to touch the psychic complexities of urban living; how itaffects us and generates weird elementals and semi-sentientnexuses of energy. It seems to me that we spend too much timesearching for a connection with the past, whilst doing our bestto ignore that we are hurtling at breakneck speed into the future.For me, magick, call it shamanic or whatever you like, is away of improving our ability to survive - as individuals, and ingroups. Shamans help their community to survive and develop,which in turn helps their own progression. I suspect its avocational calling, where the return comes back as love, support,and mutual trust. Some things, like the need to be warm andhold someone else, are eternal, whether you live in a cave orcouncil house."},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"13Staking out the TerritoryTo begin with, Iíll clear up two questions regarding the UrbanShamanic perspective. These are; a) What roles/functions canthe shamanic practitioner aspire to, and b) What is the territoryin which they are carried out - i.e. what do I mean byëcommunityí?Firstly, letís examine some shamanic roles, examples of whichmight be: Sorceror, Mythographer, Therapist, Sacred Fool, Priest,Artist, Musician, Poet. A short list, but thereís a hell of a lotinvolved in those roles; after all, developing the skills and insightsof any one of them can take a lifetime. Letís say that thedifference would be that a shaman, for example, takes on all ofthose roles whilst remaining, essentially, a shaman. Thatís quitedifferent to, for example, an artist who occasionally doesëshamanicí pictures, or a therapist who uses one or two shamanictechniques.SorcererìSorcery is the art of capturing spirits and training them to work inharness, of sorting out our powers of mind so we might manipulatethem and make them cause changes both within our minds and beyondthem.îStephen Mace, Stealing the Fire from HeavenSorcerers work with spirits, and use their abilities to causechanges in the world. By ëspirití, I mean any non-organic entitythat has some degree of individuality, from the little beings whoflit around poorly-insulated power sockets, to the Goddesses &Gods whoíve been around for thousands of millenia and arenítabout to let you forget it. All the different approaches to shamanictechniques have their own rules about spirits; how to contact"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"14them, treat them and get them to do things for you and so forth,but as a general guideline Iíd say treat them with respect and, ifyouíre not quite sure where you stand with them, a little bit ofcaution. Just like other people or unfamiliar animals really. Somespirits are quite wary of humans, while others will seem to us asmischievous or downright malicious. What is generally agreedon is that quite a lot of them like doing things for us. Withoutgetting too metaphysical about it, it seems that spirits donít havethe same kind of individuality that we do, and so by workingwith us highly individualistic beings, they acquire a ëpersonaí -in terms of a name, appearance, sigil, and something to do,and eventually a ëlife historyí of their own. By feeding themenergy, they grow in power and eventually, can becomeindependent of the person who created them in the first place.Now I realise that thatís a very simplified explanation, but Iílldeal more fully with spirit work in another volume.So, having made the point that spirits are all around us, letíshave a look at some of their uses. Most spirit-work that I tendto do is healing; enhancing a personís capabilities to fight off anillness and speed their recovery, by creating a spirit specificallyto deal with that person. Spirits tend to be good at increasingthe probability of something happening, given that itís possiblein terms of a particular situation. For example, you could makea spirit with the purpose of helping someone get a job, forexample. However, if that person had no real motivation towardsseeking employment and stayed in the house all day, then thechance of the spirit being able to manifest a positive result wouldbe much less. Thus, in this case, you might reason that the realproblem wasnít so much related to ëgetting a jobí, but to apathy,lack of self-confidence or fear of the necessary life-changesemployment would entail. It could be that your spirit workingwould have more success with one of these components of thesituation. Hence the necessity to assess a particular situation sothat your actions breed the most effective results.AmuletsAnother aspect of spirit-working is the making of amuletsobjects which have a spirit bound into them so that they enhance"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"15a particular quality such as health, courage, or restful sleep.Amulets are always in much demand, with the predominatetrend at the moment being towards using crystals as the materialbase.DivinationUsing divinatory techniques is probably the most obvious skillsconnected with shamanism in a modern setting. As soon as wordgets around that you can read the runes, cards, or palms, youcan guarantee a steady flow of people wanting readings. One-to-one sessions can lead to counselling and problem-solving.For example, I use the four tarot suits to break down a situationas follows: Wands - ideas/motivations; Cups - Overall view ordesired result; Swords - can the problem be broken down intomanagable steps; Disks - Actions that need to be carried out.Looking at a problem using this procedure may involve goal-setting and teaching the client how to draw energy or advicefrom appropriate spirits bound up into the cards. Such sessionscan also be a useful point to look at any established copingpatterns that need to be identified and modified; or to teachmethods of relaxation and Centering.A second use of divination systems is to examine a situationin terms of its different facets, the people involved, what spiritsdominate it, and what role you play in it. I mentioned this inthe introduction - the necessity of being able to ëplaceí yourselfwithin a situation so that you know from what point to act - ifindeed you should be involved at all. This is part of theassessment procedure. You can appear to others to be a bystanderin a series of events, but still be influencing the outcome, or, atthe other extreme, you can be rushing about being everyoneíscrying shoulder and up all hours of the night. Once you findyour place of power, you should stick to it, unless a drastic changeoccurs.A third role for your divinatory abilities is ësensing changeí ina broad way. Rather than focusing awareness onto a set ofsymbols, this comes to me in those moments of no-thought as Iwander the streets. The clues are fleeting and diverse - a slowbuild-up of ësomethingís about to happení which may be hinted"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"16at by the creaking of a wrought-iron gate and the simultaneousblare of horns; by the suddenly-understood shapes made bythe flocks of starlings who fling themselves across the buildingsin city square; the sense sneaks in sideways. With time, you canrecognise the truth-sense sweeping you up, and be prepared toplay and reel in the fragments - a name, a place, how bad itísgoing to be this time. In its pure form this is known as prescience.Noticing coincidences is one route towards this state; after allëcoincidenceí means two events which happen in harmony witheach other.Essentially, there are two approaches to divination; the first isthe formalised symbol systems of the Tarot, I Ching, or Runes,and the second is the more free-form approach which uses blackmirrors, pendulums and automatic drawing. You can also usespirits to help in seeking knowledge, either as Familiars residingin objects, pictures, or freely mobile, or by seeking contact withthem in Innerworld exploration via trance techniques. Ratherthan concentrate on one method, Iíd say it was a good idea touse as many different approaches as possible - that way youhave a flexible response to meet differing needs. A very practicalexample is in the case of losing things. Several times Iíve goneround to peopleís houses only to find them frantically turningthe living room upside down as theyíve lost the ..... (any numberof things). Iíve missed out numerous occasions with which toearn undying gratitude and appreciation because I didnít havea pendulum handy, nor have. at the time, a spirit who couldreliably find things (I used to have, but he doesnít live with meany more).ExorcismMention exorcism and youíll see people instantly conjuringmental pictures of children vomiting and being able to rotatetheir heads 360∞ whilst intoning in a deep voice ìIím thedevillll....î ahem. Basically though, thereís two situations whereexorcism becomes necessary, where spirits are bothering placesor objects, or people. Probably the most popular form ofdisturbance is haunted houses/flats/basements. Disturbance bywhat? you might ask. Good question. I once worked in a hospital"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"17which had a haunted ward. The regular staff kept a ëghost bookíin which all uncanny happenings were reported - what was seen,heard or felt; at what time did this occur; and in what part ofthe ward. The general opinion was that the ëghostsí were theconfused shades of ex-patients wandering about. This soundedplausible, as ëthingsí did wander about, occasionally enteringthe nurses residence and disturbing peopleís sleep. On anotheroccasion, I spent several nights in a haunted house which had aheavy, depressing gloom about the place - no one lived therevery long and there was rumour of a suicide there years ago.The last night, I was woken from a fitful sleep by the ëechoí of athick, sluggish, bubbling, and dimly perceived a faintly glowingshape in the far corner of the room. The nearest I can describeit is as a skinned horseís head with a suggestion of a slug-likebody. I only glimpsed this apparition for a second (and believeme, that was far too long) but the sense of a malevolent presencewas overwhelming. Needless to say, I beat a hasty retreat andhavenít visited the place since. Enough anecdotes. I donít havean overall theory for explaining such occurrences, but sometactical approaches are useful.AssessmentThis is a firstly a matter of asking some searching questions,such as; How long has the disturbance been going on?; in whatways does it manifest?; how many people have experienced it?;is it localised to one spot or does it move around?; does it happenat any particular times?; has the place had a past history of suchoccurences?; what do the clients think is causing the disturbance?A case I recall that illustrates the importance of asking theright questions concerned a house where the tenants wereexperiencing some upsetting disturbances - footsteps in thecorridor, being touched by invisible hands, and doors thatunlatched themselves. They believed that the source for thedisturbances was a previous tenant who had killed herself. Onthe surface, this sounded plausible enough, but subsequentdigging around revealed that one of the present tenants had ahistory of such phenomena - they seemed to follow herwherever she went, so it was more likely that the source of the"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"18manifestations was from her own Deep Mind. A placeboexorcism was performed to generally calm down the tensionsin the house, whereas the core of the case involved investigationof the person whoís own errant spirits were the source of thedisturbance. This involved referral to another magician whohad trained in hypnotherapy.Once youíve built up as much detail from your clients, youcan then investigate the situation more deeply. Freeformdivination techniques such as using a black mirror might beuseful, as might spending time in the place seeing whatimpressions you can pick up. If the spirit likes to bang thingsabout it might be a good idea to stretch cotton across objects ordoor-frames; sometimes, a pendulum suspended from a standof some kind can be used as an indicator of somethingappearing. In this sort of situation, any trick which you candevise which you think will be helpful is worth trying out.Assuming that youíve established that there is somethinglurking around, where do you go from there? Assuming thatyou canít ring the local branch of ëGhostbustersí, the next stepis to decide what should be done. Probably the most obviousthing is to go in with wands blazing and try and zap the thinginto ectoplasm; but itís a more sensible approach if you try andmake contact with the spirit, for example using a technique suchas scrying, being ëopení to impressions, or having a third partypresent to act as an independent observer.Priest/essIntercessionThe main function that a priest of any religion plays is that ofintercession between congregation and divinity. Both the highchurch priest and the Voudoun Houngan are playing the samerole - master (or mistress) of ceremonies at a meeting whereworshippers may converse (to differing degrees of directness)with their divinities.For the modern shaman, one of the likely manifestations ofthis role is being asked to perform pagan marriages (usually"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"19known as hand-fasting); naming ceremonies (of children, or re-naming of adults), house blessings; initiations, and the like. Aless than serious example of the latter is that I was privileged toordain the first Erisian Papess of York. How one ëscriptsí suchevents is purely a matter of taste and experience. Another levelof such a role is being the mc at a communal gathering - whetherthis be a drum-in, solstice celebration or acid-house party. Thisis closest to the shamanic function of leading ecstatic ceremony,which can range from tribal dance rituals to group psychedelicexperiences. In this situation, it is the shaman who leads thedance, or sets the parameters for the hallucinogen-aidedinnerworld journey, thus acting as a guide between the worlds.The shaman leads others, or opens the doorways into the dream-tracks of the inner landscape and the Mythic World. (Iíll comeback to this in more detail when looking at the Shaman asHealer). Group ecstasy is a powerful source of energy, so muchso that our culture only permits ëacceptableí outlets - take forexample the continuing furore over Stonehenge, free festivals,and acid house parties. This is not an age where ëfrienzied ritesí(such as the Greek Bachannalia for example) are frowned upon.Useful skills to acquire for this kind of situation would bedrumming, dancing, learning a few chants, using (and making)musical instruments, and enthusing/inspiring groups of peopleto get together, drum and chant. Itís simple, itís fun, anybodycan join in, and such events are wonderful for strengtheningbonds, beginning friendships, raising energy, and for having agood time. Time for a word about leadership. Anyone whotries to ëdirectí an open festival gathering by ëorganisingíeveryone else into a particular sort of ritual will only generateargument and insults. In many situations, itís not a good idea totry and visibly lead the direction an event takes. A moresuccessful approach is for example, when sitting around a fire,begin a drum beat or chant and let others take it up (or ifeveryoneís too spaced out, let it drop off). Obviously, some eventswill need more conscious direction than others, and will requiremore stage-managers - other shamans, or perhaps people actingas spirit-helpers. An obvious parallel to this is the shaman asrock ëní roller."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"20DeathDeath is one of the greatest taboos from which our culturecringes. There are a vast variety of beliefs about death and what(if anything) happens afterwards. Reincarnation; EternalDamnation; The survival of the Personality; all act as supportsfor much of our behaviour and ego-complex whilst currentlyalive. If, rather than believing that if you sin youíll be eternallycast into the fires of Hell, you believe that what you do at presenthas no possible effect on your next incarnation; itís quite likelyto affect how you go around behaving. As we go through life,our ideas about death change as we go have different experiencesand get exposed to different ideas and beliefs. Strangely enough,in times of bereavement, oneís parentally (and socially) acquiredconditioning about death reasserts itself - usually in terms oftaboo and social behaviour concerning how to act aroundbereaved people - all too often, unfortunately, this can manifestas peoplestaying away, or not allowing others enough space to mourn.Some psychiatrists for example (helpful as ever) seem to thinkthat if a person mourns for a longer period of time thanëaverageí, then this is an indicator of mental breakdown. Forthe modern shaman, brushes with death can involve you withanything from appearing at funerals, counselling the still-living,and perhaps even a rite to guide or celebrate the bodiless spiritto its meeting with the guardians of the lands of the dead. Toperform this latter task is known as acting as a Psychopomp. Ingetting to grips with counselling, then some form of course isprobably in order, as bereavement counselling is a delicate art.One sort of shamanic priest, in discussing death, may discussdifferent beliefs about death, while another sort might chooseto favour their particular chosen or favourite set of beliefs aboutthe subject. Again, this is a personal matter for each individual.InvocationInvocation is a battery of magical techniques which, when used,allow the individual to identify with a particular entity sopassionately, that some quality or attribution associated with"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"21that entity manifests in the person - such as enhanced oracularperception or ëhidden loreí. While this ability may be developedby anyone who practises magick, most people donít do it, andthus a shamanic practitioner may be asked to act as theincarnation of a particular entity as part of an event - or tobring about a similar experience in another person - ëinvokingupon someoneí, as it is known. An extreme degree of this typeof trance is possession, which, while quite common in shamaniccultures, is rarely found in modern approaches to ritual. It isnot uncommon, for example, for a Voudoun Houngan orMambo to search out ëhidden loreí (i.e. knowledge) by allowingthemselves to be ëriddení by entities (known as Loa) who speakthrough them, providing the answer. More common, in ourculture, is the phenomena of overshadowing, where theindividualís awareness is partially submerged in that of the entity.This also happens to actors, who sometimes find that, whileplaying a particular role, become so identified with that rolethat they, while on stage, can perform tasks - such as singing ordancing - that are associated with the character, but that theythemselves are not usually able to do. This is no different frommagical invocation, and the techniques involved are virtuallythe same - visualisation, speech, gestures, posture, and othersenses - particularly smell for example, with regard to incenseor essential oils. The shaman, to some extent, is also responsiblefor instructing people in how the gods behave - in many cultures,spirits (masks wearing human bodies or spirits riding humanbodies) are thought to be above the law, or can behave in waysthat are unacceptable under normal circumstances.HealerThe shamanic role of Healer has received a great deal ofattention from the pundits of the current vogue in new ageshamanism - almost to the extent that other shamanic roles havebecome obscured. ëShamanicí therapies abound, as the glamourof the shamanic stance has been taken on board by the newage/human growth schools. The growing dissatisfaction with"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"22allopathic medicine is leading more and more people to seekalternative approaches to dealing with health problems.ListeningBeing able to ëlistení to others is one of the primary skills ofany healer. We often get so caught up with what we want to sayin a conversation that we miss out on what others are actuallysaying. A good exercise in this respect is to try listening to whatsomeone else is saying to you, whilst keeping your mind blankof thoughts - thus stopping your replies leaping out of yourmouth before youíve fully digested what has been said. It takespractice to listen with attention, and then yet more practice togive an appropriate answer. Some people are good at thisnaturally, while for others some form of formal counsellingtraining might well be appropriate.A great deal has been written about the shaman as healer byother people, so Iím not going to add much more to the weightof words in other books. Suffice to say that healing is moredifficult that you might think, and should always be approachedrealistically. By this I mean that if you try and take on a problemwhich deep down, you know you canít do much about, then itis wiser to pass the person concerned to someone moreappropriate.

It was performed in Britain and Europe on the SummerSolstice between 12 - 2pm (1987), and repeated as part of SheilaBrounís Listen to the Earth project on 9th April 1990.Heal The Earth began as an idea - appearing in the midst ofa group of Leeds magia who were discussing the possibilities"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"23afforded by poiliticised magick. If, as we are told, the clansgathered together in the New Forest to work magick against thethreat of the Nazi invasion wasnít it about time, we thought,that we did something along the same lines? The original ideawas for a mass-ritual, co-ordinated through a group symbol orimage, and carried out by individuals and groups at the summersolstice.Having grasped the original idea, we then took it aroundother local pagans and asked for general feedback - and everyonewe talked to was very enthusiastic about the project taking offand being a success. this helped gather impetus and energytoward making it so.Having begun to raise energy towards realising the project,the next step was to consider the targetting of the ritual. Wediscussed the idea of focusing on very specific political issues,but eventually decided to go for a general raising of awareness- a ripple across the human planetary mind.Next, we designed the leaflet - magical artist Sheila Brounvery kindly allowed us to use her tarot design for the Ace ofCups as the central image - through which the participants inthe rite could link up their efforts. The leaflet was worded to tryand get the idea across in as succinct a way as possible, since wewanted as many people as possible to join in. A description ofthe qualities of the Ace of Cups was included, and a quotefrom the Tao te Ching expressed perfectly what we were tryingto do:ìUnder Heaven nothing is more soft and yielding than water, Yet forattacking the solid and strong, nothing is better - It has no equal.îLao Tzu.Once the leaflet had been designed, we then utilised our networkcontacts to reach as diverse a number of people as possible,and leaflets were taken abroad by friends, displayed in shopsand windows as A4 and A3 posters, handed out at theGlastonbury festival, and distributed at various gigs up and downthe country. Together, the Leeds group alone distributed over7000 leaflets (later information revealed that over 2000 leaflets"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"24were distributed in total).During the weeks running up to the Solstice, there was afeeling of energy being raised in preparation for the event. Ispent the solstice period with other project members, drummingfor the two hours on Ilkley Moor, in a ritual dedicated to Arwen,Goddess of inspiration. At various points, we all ësawí and feltthe great current of energy pouring forth into the chalice whichwas the focus for the energies.Of course, this idea isnít unique, and many different groupshave been organising mass ëritualsí for some time, and they arebecoming more popular.Raising peopleís awareness about an issue is probably moreeffective than trying to influence such a global situation directly,since to be able to act upon a problem requires consciousawareness that there is a problem in the first place. Such actsare empowering because we are conditioned into believing thatwe are basically powerless to try and change such huge issuesindividually. Participating in mass-workings reminds us that wecan be individually effective, and can contribute support in manydifferent ways. Itís all too easy to feel overwhelmed and powerlessabout major problems.MythographerProbably one of the most important shamanic roles is that ofMythographer - the person who remembers, interprets, andextents the mythic pool of their community. Myths may wellhave an eternal quality about them, but they are constantlybeing rewritten, destroyed, and recovered. Joseph Campbellsaid recently that our society desperately needed some newmyths. Not that there is a lack; just that modern myths havebecome fragmented. Examples of how myths grow are notdifficult to find. While modern ëshamanicí writers dissect andrepackage the mythic structures of the Australian Aborigines,for example, they are busy having dreams about cars and jetaircraft - such things have always existed in the Dreamtime,they say - it is just that they have only just begun to visit thoseparticular parts of the Dreaming.

In our cultures, the roleof mythographer is often expressed through the medium ofliterature and film - the old myths are constantly being retoldthrough different channels and guises. We tend to spent a greatdeal of time digging up the myths of crumbling or dead culturesand, as often as not, projecting dreams and fantasies about howwe would like the world we live in to be, onto them. Both thepast and the far-flung future are infinitely malleable, but whatabout the now - the future thatís just around the corner?"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"26Social WoundsPerhaps the most difficult aspect of using a shamanic approachin a modern setting is getting to grips with the complexities ofliving and working in the urban environment. Weíve hardlybegun to understand how living in cities affects us from a psychicpoint of view, although the experience of ëanomieí or rootlessnessis well-documented. Our cities are spawning-grounds for spiritsof many different natures, from the very real demons such aspoverty, despair, and frustration to the elementals arising fromthe tangles of electrical cables and heavy industrial areas. It isprobably easier to get a grip on cities if we regard them asliving entities; immensely complex systems in which we are justone indwelling organism. An initial problem with getting to thefeel of such a place is that it takes time to do this; time to putdown roots and feelers so that you can extend your perceptioninto the streets and roads and learn to sense the citiesí pulse -how it changes according to the seasons, and how it responds tothe subtle mood changes in its resident populations. The citygrows from generations upon generations of experience - whichdonít fade away, but become embedded in its collective psyche.A building is torn down, and another grows in its place, leavingthe ghost of the old to linger in memories and archivephotographs.The city nurtures us and crushes us at the same time. We canseek escape routes by taking our magick into the hills, or bycreating inner-world spaces in the safety of our own homes, butthe cityscape returns us to paramount reality, with the routinesof everyday life and the dependence on others for the serviceswhich allow us to live in varying degrees of security. Many ofus live in cities with an attitude of necessary sufferance,dreaming of escape.

Loose ëcommunitiesí and cliquesarise and fall as the different social strata constantly shift acrosstime. The psyche of a city can be terrifying - vast, constantlychanging; slow, yet its moods are perceptible. Itís difficult enoughto establish empathy with our fellow humans - how do we cometo terms with these vast beings through which we move eachday?In non-industrial cultures, the ëpowerí of the shamanicpractitioner may sometimes be inherently bound up with anindividualís ëterritoryí - be it a village or sacred ground. Afterliving in Leeds for three years, Iím starting to feel this sort ofaffection for the city. Sometimes I canít wait to escape from itsembrace - itís nice to wander around, but Iím beginning to feelaffinity with the entity which is Leeds itself, even though Iíveonly come to know a small part of it with any sense of familiarity.Much of this awareness grows over time - getting to know aplace, but I sometimes find it useful to let my awareness wanderthrough the streets in the form of a cat or bird, exploring theinnerworld map of the city in my head, and then to wanderthrough the different areas, trying to sense the dominant moodsand histories that settle like sediment in the under-levels.Perhaps one of the key tasks for would-be shamans living incities is to try and make sense of we live in them. A mammothtask, certainly, but worthwhile if we can develop a magicalmethodology which is able to come to grips with the complexitiesof city life, and look at the magical properties of thatenvironment. For me, this is a very slow process of feeling myway through territory which is familiar surroundings, yet thereare few guidelines to work from. One of the first questions thatI tried to get to grips with was, is it possible to magically affectthe collective psyche of a city, or a particular region? Since areascan be ëscarredí, for example by disasters such as occurred atHillsborough in Sheffield, or by economic decline, is it possibleto try and heal the scars, if only fractionally? Such scars of coursehave far-reaching effects for the people involved, but thewounding seems also to permeate the whole area.

One tends to be cynical about hearing ëauthoritiesítalking about ëcommunity spirití, but much more accepting ofoneís contemporaries. For me, community arises from a senseof being in a particular network of relations, where people havea consensus of shared concerns and viewpoints, and colludewith each other to maintain them. This can range from everydaysurvival concerns, to evolving a distinct, but often very subtle,set of mores about how individuals interact with each other.You can see this happening when you enter a new communityfor the first time - itís very easy to make social gaffs, before youare accepted and treated like anyone else in the area. Often,ëcommunityí can be used to imply that everyone in a particulargroup shares common values, and itís easy to forget that thatwithin the network of social relations, individuals donít usuallyshare all the same views on all issues. This can be seen veryclearly when people who are perceived as being a part of adistinct community gather together, and, surprise surprise,arguments break out over particular issues. Usually, communitiesare much more complex than we like to think.In the previous section of this book I looked at some of theroles that a shamanic practitioner might fulfil in an urbancommunity, the emphasis being on working with individuals.Another approach that I have admittedly only begun to look atis workings for particular communities as a whole, in a similar"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"29way that a tribal shaman can work for her or his tribal group.FuriesLast year (summer í89) brought a heat-wave to the communityin which I live, and as the temperature climbed there was arising spiral of violent or potentially-violent incidences againstwomen in the area, plus a surge of homophobia. Several of usdiscussed a possible magical approach to counteracting this trend,which resulted in a ritual to unleash ëthe Furiesí - a group offemale spirits whose action is to constrain oppressive males(originally from the Greek mythos). Essentially, the ritual was ahighly concentrated vortex of energy which allowed the Furiesinto the collective consciousness of women across Leeds. Therite served to enabled the women involved to articulate anddirect their anger about oppressive male behaviour, so that theenergy was channeled into the rite, rather than being held withinand repressed (which is highly stressful). Liberating anger inthis way can be healing in itself. In the weeks that followed theworking, we heard of several cases of women turning uponmen who were oppressing them, and the spate of local incidentsdropped also.The ScreamThis is an anger-channeling exercise which was worked out aspart of the Furies working, which should give you some idea ofthe approach to this kind of magickal work.ìImagine yourself to be all-woman, from every culture, in every country,throughout all the ages, down throughout the centuries, all faces, allages, all races, gathering your anger at oppression, and shouting that youhave had enough and are not taking ANY MORE SHIT!îAs the energy is not directed at specific individuals, it becomesëfree energyí (or pure Will) which can be magically directed,causing a ripple across the collective psyche of the groupconcerned.

At the moment Iím trying to work with situations -which requires looking dispassionately at the different elementsin an evolving situation; divining probable outcomes, anddeciding at what point, and most importantly, how to intervenemagically - if indeed such is required at all. Iím often asked tobecome involved with developing situations, and occasionally,find myself ëhanging backí for no apparent reason. I findfollowing my intuition on such occasions usually leads to mefinding out why it isnít a good idea to become involved, at leastin the manner initially indicated.

Thomas Vaughan, Anthrosophia Theomagica, 1650.In the 1930ís, Wilhelm Reich, observing the battle betweencommunist Left and fascist Right, observed that the problemthe Left had in gaining mass appeal was that it gave an Intellectualanswer to lifeís problems. Unable to move beyond the level ofmaterial changes (jobs, housing, wages), it lacked a sense ofCosmogeny (a total reality) as a backdrop. In contrast, Reichsaw that the fascists understood the necessity for a mythologicaldimension to their political gatherings. For it is by appealing tothe mythic world of experience that social reality may bemanipulated. The Nazi party made constant and efficient useof symbolism, myth, and powerful emotive ideals to projecttheir visions into the mass mind of German culture. Of course,it is not wholly responsible for the fascistís rise to power, but itsimportance is often neglected when one approaches the modernpolitical arena.The British Nationalist Party for example, are a good exampleof a political group well aware of magick (if only unconsciously).They are mimetic, sending tendrils into any kind of situationwhich will feed them - Green Politics, Paganism, The Campaignto save Leeds Markets - all issues which have a direct, emotionalappeal. They are further reinforced by the Meme (viral idea) ofXenophobia, and itís mutation of anti-intellectualism - the virtueof stupidity.

The Word Virus is avery small unit of word or image that entraps the energy of itshuman host into recycling an instruction or behaviour pattern.Ever walked around, unable to get a popular tune out of yourhead? Advertising, slogans, jingles, words and images are allcarriers for the parasitic virus.

Somepeople tend to shy away from political magick, but since theSeventeenth century, magick has had a close association withthe political struggle for freedom.Political magick, for me, is a matter of ground zero politics -that is, survival against oppressive institutions and viruses. Thefirst Heal the Earth working drew its inspiration from StarhawkísDreaming the Dark, which draws together political issues and amagical approach to regaining power, and opposing oppressivestructures without falling back into the power-games throughwhich they are maintained.

If you believe in individual free will (surelya fundamental pagan belief?) then any attempt to gain ëpoweroverí another individual is not only contradictory, but alsodevalues yourself. Most cases of cursing that I have come acrossare related to petty arguments and desires to maintain controlover a situation which has changed in a way that the peopleinvolved are emotionally unequipped to deal with. However, itshould be pointed out that in some cultures, cursing is seen as avalid approach to resolving problems. Techniques of cursingseem to be most highly developed in cultures which havesuffered from repression from a more powerful group, and areotherwise unable to articulate and recover their power. This isone of the shamanic roles which has received scant attention,apart from some Feminist writers who have looked at ways ofconstraining and binding rapists. Modern approaches to thiskind of magick have generated the tactic of cursing institutionsrather than individuals, an example of this being Pagans againstthe Poll Tax.Pagans Against the Poll TaxThis is an anonymously-circulated document which sets outguidelines for magically countering the Poll Tax. The basic ideais that the exchange of money is a form of energy transfer whichhas very powerful associations - being one of the basic roots ofour society. An old wart-charmerís trick is to ëbuyí warts off asufferer and transfer them somewhere else. The Poll Tax curseis a blank cheque where the user signs using a magickal persona,writes in appropriate sigils instead of money, and ëpaysí thetargeted authority a ëproblemí which will disrupt theimplementation of Poll Tax collection, such as ësix months ofcomputer troubleí.

Essentially, this is a matter for each individualto consider, but consider this; being on the receiving end ofrepression and not being able to do anything about it can grindyou down awfully quickly. Likewise, Starhawkís magicopoliticalwriting came out of the Seventies, before eco-action was seenas acceptable. Morever, you canít expect freedom and acceptancefrom a power structure that survives by perpetuating limitationsand intolerance. I wouldnít be surprised to hear of third-worldshamans who are engaged in magical action against forest-burners, land developers and low-flying military aircraft whichthreaten their way of life. The Emerald Forest explored such astance, with its final scene of a dam being destroyed by tribalearth magick. Peasants in the Middle Ages often resorted topoppets and pins to strike back at oppressive landowners.The Furies working I mentioned in the previous section canalso be considered as a ëcurseí - against violence and oppressionby one section of society against others. It was perhaps, anextreme situation which demanded, so we felt, extreme action.But if we must curse at all, surely it is better to try and changeoppressive structures and ideas; to attempt to destroy the demonsbred of fear, ignorance, hatred and repression than leave themto wander across the world unchecked? For something to grow,whether it be an individual, an institution, or a culture, sometimesit is necessary to destroy the psychic structures by which theentity maintains itself in a limited space - a fortress, if you will,of fixed beliefs, dogmas, and entrenched attitudes. Sometimesthese fortresses cannot be unbricked by rational argument andgentle persuasion - especially when whatever is lurking insidethem is trying to crush you (whether with boots, bureaucracy orby removing your freedom to act).

It should also be stressed thatthese techniques are continually being updated and developed,as individuals are attracted to the shamanic perspective fromdifferent backgrounds and interests. We have seen the resurgenceof shamanism in all forms, from the ëhistoricalí traditions suchas Celtic, Amerind, Nordic, Finnish and Aboriginal Shamanicapproaches, to the New Age formulations ëchannelledí fromspirit guides or dolphins. Shamanism contains both an effectivepsycho-technology and an positive life ethic, and is malleableenough to be adapted to differing situations and requirements.Shamanic techniques and concepts can also be found lurkingin many modern institutions, from sports psychology tomanagement training; alternative therapies to drama training.Sometimes, I have the impression that shamanic techniques arein danger of becoming ësanitisedí - that the magical essentialsof shamanic practice are being edged out as the ëshamanicíself-improvement manuals stream out of the publishing houses.So too, I am becoming increasingly wary of those who rush tolabel themselves as shamans. As I hope Iíve demonstrated inthis book, itís by no means an easy label to live up to, andpersonally, I would say that though I spend a great deal of timeusing ëshamanic techniquesí, I donít see myself as a shaman -that, for me, is a glamour to be avoided.As far as future developments in shamanic practice go, I wouldlike to see more exploration of what the implications of usingshamanic techniques in the big cities might be.

The essentialsof magical experience and praxis are similar, no matter whatsymbols and words we wrap them up in, and once youíve got togrips with one particular approach or technique, itís easier tolearn another. Of course, deciding what next to incorporate inyour approach to practice is a matter of personal taste andjudgement. Increasingly, I find that virtually any life skill can beuseful, whether it is information-based, a practical creative skill,or a set of magical techniques from a particular system.Personally, I hold the view that the idea of separate traditionsand systems belongs to another age. Whilst training as anOccupational Therapist, I was taught to approach situations anddeploy a battery of techniques and approaches that were mosteffective in that situation, and I approach shamanic practice ina similar fashion, drawing from my past experience andknowledge, and selecting what seems to me the best approachgiven the circumstances. I would find this difficult to do if Ionly worked within a single ëtraditioní - since the world generallyoffers up a wider variety of problems that any one approachcan deal with. And we live in an increasingly complex worldwhere perhaps, no single individual can cope with taking onthe many different roles that the shamanic perspectiveencompasses. Knowing other people who are working fromdifferent perspectives, concentrating on different areas of workis increasingly important. We need more dialogue betweendifferent practitioners; a dialogue which transcends personaldifferences and the wariness which comes from not understanding(or appreciating) the validity of another personís approach.Growth comes from the cross-fertilisation of ideas, and thehealthy exchange of views.
