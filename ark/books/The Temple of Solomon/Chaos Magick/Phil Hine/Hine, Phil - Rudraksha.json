[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"Rudraksha is an irregular newsletter from theGanna Chakra. We are a London-based groupof magicians exploring the mysteries of TantricSadhana. The “Gannas” are the troop ofhobgoblins, ghouls and night-walkers whohang out with Shiva, and have been describedas “the hooligans of heaven.” We hope thisnewsletter will become a forum for sharingideas, exchanging info and tips, etc, for anyonewho is interested in Tantric Magic.Rudraksha BeadsThe chains of Rudraksha beads that Siva wearsaround his neck, arms, ankles and hair aretrophies of victory. In his incarnation as Kali hebeheads demons and lets their heads dry andshrink, so that they become the beads of a prayer-chain, like a rosary. Siva’s followers wear thosebeads as well, as tokens of their victories ofdemons such as egotism, hatred, fear, desire,jealousy, etc. The name Rudraksha means “Eyeof Rudra”. It is also said that the beads are tearsof joy shed by Siva, after he had destroyed a titanmonster, and all the gods showed theirthankfulness.In India, there is a very special and complicatedscience that deals with the symbolism of theRudraksha beads. For example, the varyingcolours - white, red, yellow and black berriessignify the four castes of Brahmins, Warriors,Citizens and Slaves. Of particular importance arethe grooves, or “mouths” in the bead.The most common bead has 5 grooves, and it isthought that Siva himself appears in these. Somebeads have only one groove, whilst others haveup to thirty-two. The more uncommon the bead,the more expensive they are when sold.Apparently the rarest type of bead is a mutation,shaped like a banana, and bearing only onegroove. A bead such as this is so special andvaluable that it is set in gold. It is said that onlyrarely does a tree yield a berry such as this, andthat if it does, it occurrs in a three-fold fashion:one flies to heaven, one sinks into the earth, andone falls to the ground to be found by a chosenman. Apparently the King of Nepal has a few ofthese beads amongst his treasures, and the templeof the Lord of the Animals (Pashupati) containstwo of these beads, which are shown to devoteesonly once a year, at the November New MoonFestival. It is thought that seeing such a beadonce will rid one of all accumulated sins.Beads with two grooves are called “Siva-Sakti”,and they fulfill all desires of the owner. Beadswith three grooves are called “Brahma-Vishnu-Mahesh” and they glow with wisdom and wealth.Beads with four grooves are said to be anincarnation of Brahma and they help the wearerachieve the four life goals: Dharma (Right Wayof Living), Artha (Wealth), Kama (Joy), andMoksha (Salvation). As Brahma is the god ofintelligence, this bead helps the wearer overcomememory problems, stupidity, and speech defects.When a bead has five grooves, Siva appears init. He who wears this bead overcomes allproblems. This bead is related to the fifth headof Brahma, which Siva cut off, hence it can alsohelp one deal with the sin of murder. A bead withsix grooves can symbolise Kartikeya, Lord ofWar, or perhaps Ganesha. A bead with sevengrooves symbolises the Saptamatrikas - theSeven Mothers. A bead with eight grooves grantslongevity, and hinders the speaking of lies. If a"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"bead has nine grooves, it symbolises the goddessDurga. It must only be worn around the neck,and it makes the wearer fearless. A bead withten grooves is the bead of the god Krishna. Abead with eleven grooves is worn by wives, andhelps the longevity of their husbands. A beadwith twelve grooves is dedicated to Surya, theSun God, and protects the wearer fromunemployment and sickness. A bead withthirteen grooves helps in the conception ofchildren, and advances the wearer’s wealth andluck. A bead with fourteen grooves heals withthe power of Rudra or Hanuman, and givessiddhi.There are further rules concerning how to groundbeads up for curative potions; in what manner,place and time the beads should be worn; howthey should be cleaned and charged, and whichfoods the wearer should eat, and which shouldbe avoided - for it is believed that eating foodwhich is inappropriate to a particular bead willinvoke its adverse effects.Lila DurgaA Shiva Opening RiteThis basic opening rite establishes aspects ofShiva in each of the 4 cardinal points, the Upperworld, and the Nether World, and proceeds toawaken the indwelling divinity by means ofNyasa and meditation. It can be used as a dailyrite, as a preliminary to further magical work,and this basic format can be developed muchfurther - one example being that it could be usedto open puja on any of the aspects of Shiva asgiven below.Format:0.

Union with ShivaThe celebrant should then meditate on himselfas Shiva as the Mahadeva (Great God) for aspace, until he decides to continue with whatevermagical work he desires to perform. I wouldsuggest that, if using the rite as a completeworking in itself, or, as a transition to other actsof magic, the celebrant meditate upon himselfas Shiva The Lord of Yoga - his body is still as arock, his mind floats freely, like a leaf blown onthe wind. He sits calmly, at the centre of theUniverse.4. A Suggested ClosingMeditate for a period upon yourself as the Lordof Yoga. Then, facing East, bow and say:I close this circleMay all experience peace, freedom andhappinessOm Shiva Shanti.NotesThe verses for each of the aspects of Shiva donot hail from any one source. I have attemptedto present appropriate symbolism and phrases formeditation for each of the aspects.KalkinathSources:Gods of Love and Ecstasy - Alain DaniélouThe Myths and Gods of India - Alain DaniélouTantra Magick - AMOOKOSThe Presence of Siva - Stella KramrischConneXionsWeirdglowInternational Newsletter of the Nathas.

The concept is closeto the old Hermetic idea of the union of theMicrocosm and the Macrocosm. in order toloosen the boundaries of self, the self issubmerged in a bigger image and asked tovisualize paradoxical conditions, i.e. being in aflower, the ocean and physically doingsomething, all at the same time.There are various oceans in which sadhana canbe undertaken. These include: oceans of milk,clarified butter, sugar, and many others. Each hasparticular difficulties and effects which can beexplored.Often these meditations are ritualised.In India, for many people, alcohol is taboo. Forinitiates of many left-handed tantric sects, wineis regarded as a goddess and drinking as a sacredrite. This meditation should be viewed in thiscontext.“Imagine that your spine is the stem of aflowering plant growing in an ocean of the purestred wine. The long stem flowers above your skulland the red flower floats on the surface of thewine. Place an image of yourself, dressed in redclothes, in the centre of the red flower. The oceanglints and shimmers in the strong light. You seea long way on thelimitless ocean of wine. Feelthat the stem is tugged gently from below thesurface. The flower is slightly submerged andwine pours in over the petals and syphons downthe stem, slowly filling up your body, making itindistinguishable from the ocean in which it issubmerged.When you are ready to finish, feel that thepressure on your stem is released. The red flowerbobs up to the surface and wine ceases to pourinto your body. Place the image of yourself backin your heart and allow yourself to focus againon the place where you are working.”VishvanathGanna ChakraDevelopments* Bhairavi *The Ganna Chakra is currently exploring theGoddess Bhairavi.
