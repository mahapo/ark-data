Self-awarenessis not automatic, nor is it a constant. Exercises and techniques ofenhancing Self-Awareness come under the domain of Ego Magic.Ego Magic is concerned with increasing one’s ability to makerealistic assessments of one’s own self-image and identifying andmodifying behaviours and cognitive patterns which aredysfunctional. At least that’s the theory. Considering how importantEgo Magic/Deconditioning techniques are stressed as being to thepractice of Chaos Magic, it’s amazing how little information onthem there actually is. When one considers the Ego Magic techniquesthat have been made available through Chaos Magic texts, thefollowing points should be considered:(1) It is very easy to make a shift in belief content which does notactually change the process (the way the belief is enacted) - i.e. ashift from fanatical Christian to fanatical Pagan isn’t verychallenging.(2) It is very easy to rationalise a lot of potentially boundary-breakingactions in such a way that they no longer present a threat to one’sself-image. “I let X fuck me as an act of Anathema (see Liber Nullp48).”(3) We are really good at fooling ourselves as to what constitutes,for us, liberating behaviour, and we all seem to share a commonhuman tendency that goes: “I am more liberated/alive/free becauseI am into magic/wear a bolt through my tongue/leather trousers,than those who don’t.”(4) We’re also really good at glossing over ‘core’ problems withsurface behaviour which serves as a distraction from the underlying"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"4issue, but doesn’t make it go away. “No amount of fucking aroundwill allow me to escape from not liking myself.”(5) There is a common tendency to avoid Ego Magic as it is oftenthreatening, painful, and may resist ‘instant’ solutions.Although there is a tendency to consider Ego Magic as anindividual task, it becomes obvious that most actions relating toEgo Magic are pretty pointless unless they involve, at some point,other people. Whilst it is generally understood that social groups ofvarious kinds play a large part in shaping our beliefs, attitudes, valuesand social behaviour, it is rarely acknowledged that working withEgo Magic techniques in a small group can be beneficial in gettingto grips with, and working for effective changes.How Can a Group Be Helpful?Group Members can provide the impetus for work to take place andcontinueA Group has more resources available (experience, ideas,knowledge)A Group can provide immediate Feedback to its membersA Group can act as a space for ‘taking risks’.For this project to proceed effectively, participating groups need tobe clear about:1) ConfidentialityAny disclosures made by a participant during times when this projectis being run, must be treated as strictly confidential.2) CommitmentFor the project to be successful, participants must want to do it -otherwise there seems to be little point."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"53) HonestyParticipants need to be honest about their own, internal responses,and honest in their feedback to others. This is a major problem, aspeople tend not to take social risks, for fear of changing the balanceof a relationship.4) Ground RulesAny ground-rules set up by a group must be adhered to rigorously.PERSONAL AWARENESSThis introductory module focuses on the development of Personal,or Self-Awareness skills, recalling the injunction made to the initiateto the Eleusinean Mysteries - “Know Thyself.” Most individualsare capable of improving their understanding of themselves andbecoming more aware of their motivations.Self-AwarenessSelf-Awareness can be broadly defined as one’s capacity forintrospection towards one’s own biography, values, attitudes,identifications, needs and how one’s behaviour is affected by others.It also includes awareness of being an individual, and beingresponsible for one’s own actions. A high degree of Self-Awarenessis generally held to be necessary for one’s well-being.Although all individuals are unique, patterns of behaviour,motivation and thought are similar and it is generally believed thata high degree of Self-Awareness is necessary in order to understandthe behaviour of others. Whilst we like to think of ourselves asunique and different from others, our sense of selfhood is alsodependent on our psycho-social environment. If we understand therelationship between self and (social) environment, we are betterable to relate to other people, particularly if their behaviour and‘personality’ seems to be fundamentally at odds with ours."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"6This module presents some simple exercises aimed at increasingSelf-Awareness. Please note that an exercise is successful only tothe extent that it provokes some further thought, discussion, or actionbeyond itself. I have kept theory to a minimum, as I want to focusattention on practical experience.Module ObjectivesExamine Self-AppraisalRecognition of Abilities & LimitationsIdentification of RolesRecognising/Evaluating Personal AimsExploring Self-EsteemBeginning The ModuleI have designed this module so that a minimum of introductorytheory is followed by exercise sets, each with any support theoryrequired for discussion and clarification. To work through theexercises, one member of the group should be designated as the‘facilitator’ (since everyone participates in the exercises, there isno leader in the distinct sense). You may like to rotate the facilitatorfor each exercise set, but please remember, all of you are equallyresponsible for doing the exercise. The role of the facilitator is tolead-off and prompt discussions, announce the end of exercises,prompt for feedback, etc. Each subsequent Module session shouldbe begun by any feedback and discussion arising from the previousone.Facilitators should read through exercise sets before presentingthem and ensure that any required materials or props are assembled.Pacing ExercisesI would recommend that you do not cover more than one exerciseset per meeting of your group. This gives plenty of time for follow-through work, assimilation of points raised and feedback. Wherepossible, I have noted an average time for the duration of the exercise,"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"7but please remember that exercises should be followed by groupdiscussion.Follow-Through WorkYou will notice that some exercises are tagged with Follow-Throughoptions. Follow-Through exercises can be done by participantsoutside of the group meeting, as further experiments in PersonalAwareness, and any results can be discussed at the next meeting.Follow-Through work is an optional addition to the main sequenceof exercises.Some Key Concepts related toSelf-AwarenessSelf-ImageThis term is used to refer to how an individual perceives himself,and core elements of the Self-Image include: name, bodily presence,body-image, age, sexuality, dominant roles & identifications. Someaspects of the Self-Image are more important to a person than others:it is more upsetting if these are challenged. How far does a person’sself-image correspond with the way he is seen by others? Peopletend to present a somewhat improved, idealized and censored versionof themselves for public inspection, so there is likely to be somediscrepancy. Also, some people succeed in insulating themselvesfrom the views of others so that they are unaware of how they areregarded.Ego-IdealThe Ego-Ideal is the kind of person one would most like to be. Itmay consist of a fusion of desired characteristics drawn from varioussources. There are varying degrees of conflict between Self-Imageand Ego-Ideal, and this dissonance can be extremely complex. Somepeople, for example, appear to show little conflict - because they"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"8perceive themselves so inaccurately. Furthermore, if a person showsmuch conflict between Image and Ideal, it contributes to low Self-Esteem, but may also lead to efforts to attain the Ego-Ideal. Suchefforts can take a variety of forms. One is to be concerned with theactual attainment of certain standards, ideals or results. Another isto make an intensified effort to project a certain self-image. If theappearance is in conflict with the reality, this strategy will producefurther stress and inner conflict.Self-EsteemSelf-Esteem is the extent to which a person approves of and acceptshimself - as himself, or in comparison to others. Like Self-Image,Self-Esteem has a more or less stable core, together with a series ofsubordinate esteems based on relationships with different groups.Self-Esteem can become quite complex because, for example, somepeople develop an exaggerated self-regard in order to compensatefor basic feelings of inferiority.RolesRoles are generally understood as sub-identities which an individualholds in relationship to particular activities, groups or otherindividuals. Individuals tend to play roles in a characteristic style.The way an individual sees himself in each role is a part of his Self-Image. He may perceive himself vaguely or clearly."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"9SET ONE: SELF-CHARACTERIZATIONa) Third Person SketchWrite a Character Sketch of yourself in the third person, i.e. “JohnSmith is.....” as might be written by a very close friend. Allow 15minutes for this to be done. After all have finished, each personpasses their sketch to the person on their left, and then each sketchis read out in turn.Points for Discussion: was this difficult or easy? Did anyonefeel uncomfortable? Why do you think it might be useful?Follow-Through ideas:Write third-person Character-Sketch as though you were appraisingyour suitability for a job.Write Obituary as though ‘you’ had just dropped dead that moment.As above, but project the Obituary forwards to five years in thefuture.b) Personal Strengths(i) Each person makes a list of six strengths and six weaknessesthat you see yourself as having. Note: you do not have to discussthese in the group.Discussion points: how difficult/easy was it to draw up the lists?Why? Was it easier to think about weaknesses? If so, why? Discussas a group anything which anyone thinks, feels or has learned as aresult of the exercise.(ii) Each person identifies and talks about “A strength I wish I had,and what I would have to do to acquire it.”"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"10Follow-Through ideas:Look at the Strengths and Weaknesses that you have identified.Is there a way that you could use one of your perceived strengths toovercome one your perceived weaknesses. If so, how? Will you dothis?c) Intentions and OutcomesChoose two social groups that you are a member of:i) Why did you join them?ii) What did you originally want from them for yourself?iii) Have those intentions been realized?iv) Have you modified your original intentions?v) What are they at the momentvi) Divide overall group into 2 subgroups, discuss each other’sintentions, and, using keywords, create a list of everyone’s desires.vii) Compare & discussviii) Discuss strategies for tackling some or all of these ideas"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"11SET TWO: SELF-ESTEEMIt’s generally believed that some degree of self-esteem, and alsothe sense that other people value one, is necessary for individualfunctioning. Self-Esteem is socially useful. To discount altogetherthe value that other people give to you, or equally, to be swayedentirely by their values so that you are uncomfortably over-dependent on them, indicates a problem with Self-Esteem.What we generally need is a realistic sense of ourselves asloveable, in some ways capable, able to give out regard, in someways talented and skilful, before we are likely to feel secure enoughto ‘let in’ other people’s perceptions of us. We may not take thementirely on board, but will at least get a ‘feel’ of them, rather thanblocking them out or rubbishing them.Being open about having a good opinion of yourself is particularlytaboo in Britain, although our Norse ancestors saw nothing wrongin bragging. The heroic boast was accepted as a necessity if someonewished to encourage himself to heroic deeds.a) Self-WorthEach person takes a turn in telling the rest some of what they likeabout themselves. As each person speaks, the rest of the group shouldbe particularly aware of whether the speaker sounds, looks, & feelshonest, confident or convinced about what they are saying, or ifthey are enjoying it or not, and give feedback on this basis. Doingthis can bring up great defensiveness, which is sometimes expressedas silence, nervous laughter, or rationalisations about avoiding ego-inflation. It’s not necessary (or desirable) to totally focus on Self-Esteem all the time, but it can be useful to check your feelingsperiodically."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"12After everyone has taken a turn at doing this, discuss your findingsas a group.b) Anchors to Self-Esteem(i) Each person lists six things which they feel are essential to theirsense of Self-Esteem, for example, “being valued for what I know Iam good at”. This list need not be ranked in terms of which is mostimportant - just six points.(ii) One member of the group rolls a six-sided dice and calls out thenumber. Then each person in turn discloses that numbered item “Ineed to be working to feel worthwhile.” Other group members canquestion this statement, probe for more information, & discuss it.Follow-Through idea:Select one of these anchor points and explore, through meditation,visualization etc, how the absence of it affects you. Do thisthoroughly, until you can find a way to accommodate for this lacksuccessfullyc) ExaggerationsThis is a two part exercise. For the first part, everyone millsaround, making eye contact with another person briefly and makinga statement which runs themselves down “I can’t run for toffee”, “Ican never get to meetings on time.”For the second part, everyone moves around making brief eyecontacts to signal communications, but this time make unqualifiedboasts, which need not necessarily be true: “I’m speaking atWembley next week; I’ll get rave reviews.”Discuss the effects of this. Did people have a harder time boastingthan running themselves down, or vice versa? Can wild boasts tellus something about ourselves?"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"13Follow-Through Ideas:Between now and the next meeting, make a few boasts and a fewself-depreciating statements to a cross-section of people. Noticetheir reactions to this, and how you feel afterwards."},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"14SET THREE: ATTITUDESAttitudesWhat are attitudes? Broadly defined, an attitude is a tendency to actfavourably or unfavourably to certain objects, persons, or situations.Attitudes are expressed in the form of Opinions. Opinions are oftennot as extreme as the attitude which it is an expression of, as mostpeople express themselves in fairly moderate terms. Attitudesstrongly influence behaviour, even if we are are not aware of them.Factors Associated with Attitude Formation:i) AttributionWe tend to attribute other people’s behaviour in a situation to theirdisposition, rather than factors of the situation, although we are farmore willing to attribute our own behaviour to the situation, ratherthan our inherent disposition. Attribution also refers to the personalrules & assumptions (called ‘implicit personal theories’) we use tojudge people.ii) The Primacy EffectWe are generally biased towards creating attitudes based on initialimpressions. This first view, which can be taken in as brief a periodas fifteen seconds, can be both difficult to dislodge and is often thelongest lasting. Anything that a person does in subsequent meetingsis likely to reinforce that first impression."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"15iii) The Recency EffectIf there is a long gap between encounters, then our most recentexperience of a person, for better or for worse, increases inimportance. Note that both Primacy and Recency Effects not onlyoperate for individuals, but also any message they are putting across.iv) StereotypesA stereotype is a set of attributes assumed to be characteristic ofcertain kinds of individuals. Stereotypes can be very useful so longas they remain flexible.DiscussionThe group discusses the above points and each person shouldrecall a situation in which they were involved, where they canidentify the operation of each of the above four factors.a) Attitude IdentificationEach person lists three attitudes which they carry. For each attitude,try and identify its Cognitive component (What I think about...), itsAffective Component (What I feel about...) and its BehaviouralComponent (What I do when....). When everyone has finished,discuss any findings & feelings raised. Note that Behaviour is notalways consistent with attitude, and may even be contradictory.Changing AttitudesChanging attitudes can be difficult, if only because we tend toactively avoid information which challenges our views, and alsotend to continuously be reinforcing our own attitudes, interpretingany ambiguous situation in support of our attitudes."},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"16b) Discussion topic:You meet up with an old friend who, whilst being sympathetic tomagic in general, seems to have a very negative attitude to ChaosMagic. Assuming that you want to do something about this, howwould you try and alter this person’s attitude?NB: This could also (optionally) be tried out as a role-play, withone person taking on the role of the ‘friend’, another the personwho is trying to change their opinion, and the other group membersobserving the interchange. Different people could attempt differenttechniques, and then any outcome discussed.c) Owning OpinionsOwning personal opinions, can be at times difficult. We share acommon tendency to distance ourselves from our perceptions andjudgements and try and make ‘objective’ statements, or statementswhich are somehow definitive. This involves the use of impersonalconstructions “It’s a pity that...; It’s good that...” and generalities“Most people think...; We all think; I’m sure I can speak for everyonewhen I say...”.i) Have a short group discussion on this tendency. Why do we doit? Does it feel good to make general statements? If so, why?ii) Between now and the next group meeting, monitor your speechpatterns so that you avoid whenever possible, generalities andimpersonal constructs. Instead, say “I...”. It isn’t egotistical, it’smore accurate. Be aware of how doing this makes you feel, andhow other people respond to this. Also, be aware of how other peopleuse impersonal constructs and generalities. If appropriate, try andchallenge them and monitor their response."},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"17SET FOUR: ROLE IDENTIFICATIONIndividuals all take on a wide variety of roles in society. The rolesare interactive and individuals move between them. Each role isaccompanied by personal attitudes, values, learned behaviours andinternalised expectations. Roles provide an easy solution to theproblem of self-image - there is a clear identity which can be adopted.However, they can also be a problem since so much of the selfcannot be expressed in a particular role, and a standard solution isto act in such a way that one becomes slightly ‘distanced’ from therole - indicating that there is more to oneself than can be seen injust this role. We also need to be aware of:i) Role Expectation - the norms associated with that role that identifythe attitudes, behaviours and cognitions that are required andexpected for someone who occupies a particular role.ii) Role Conflicts - an example of Role-Conflict is where there is avariance between how you perceive a role, and how others expectyou to perform in it.All of us have ‘audience groups’ who monitor our performance, forexample a doctor has colleagues and patients. There are also‘reference groups’ against which we measure our performance. Wehave to continuously make choices about the degree of significancewe give to these. Our behaviour in roles is both a function of personalchoice and extrinsic factors."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"18a) Role IdentificationEach person chooses 2 social groups of which they are a memberand attempts to identify (& list) the different roles which they takeon in those groups. Then each person attempts to identify who inthose, are your “Audience Group” and your “Reference Group” ineach group. Then identify which roles you enjoy most - and why;and which roles you like least, and why. This is followed byFeedback & discussion.b) Autonomy and MutualitySome psychologists believe that in all groups, there is a varyingdegree of tension between ‘mutuality’ - the degree to whichindividuals take on and express the norms of the group, and‘autonomy’ - the ways in which individual uniqueness is stressed.To paraphrase Irving Goffmann: Our sense of self arises from thewalls of society, yet our sense of being a unique individual residesin the cracks.i) Each person selects a social group of which they are a memberii) Attempt to identify the norms of that groupiii) Identify how you express those normsiv) Identify any way in which you distance yourself from thosenorms- Discuss.c) Role NegotiationThis is a more interactive exercise aimed bringing more reality intoyour perceptions of yourself.i) Everyone sits with pen and paper in a large circle and writesdown everybody’s names in a column on the left of the paper. Therest of the page is divided into 3 columns headed MORE, LESS andTHE SAME. For each person present you write a one-word or shortphrase to describe what you want more of and less of from them,and what you want maintained."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"19ii) In the next part, you pair with everyone in turn and tell themwhat you have written about them and hear what they have writtenabout you. You may have to use words carefully here. At the sametime, you have a second sheet of paper divided up the same way asthe first, entitled ABOUT ME, on which you write down whateveryone else wants from you.During the paired conversations, you can negotiate with other peopleabout monitoring each other - supporting each other’s wants.iii) Finally, reset the circle and give feedback for discussion. Checkif people’s self-esteem has been enhanced or lowered."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"20Feedback EvaluationOnce all the exercises have been worked through, please make aGroup Evaluation of the module.1. Consider each exercise in turn, and for each:a) Rate it’s usefulness for each person on a scale of 1 to 10 (where1 = not useful and 10 = very valuable).b) Rate its difficulty for the group to complete on a scale of 1 to 10(where 1 = easy and 10 = very difficult).c) Make any additional comments for each exercise, including anyof the Follow-Through options used.2.
