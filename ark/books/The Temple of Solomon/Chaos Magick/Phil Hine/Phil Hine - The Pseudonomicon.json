To enter the faery realm takes but a single step. Magic is not something which one merely 'does.' It's personal, up-close. It twists you and skews your perception of the world, tipping you into a world of signs and portents. A territory of fathomless symbol; of mysteries lurking in the shadows. The cian is hypersensitive to the sudden implosion of significance, which is at times a blessing, and at others, a curse. How do we gather meaning frorn this magical world of What makes one valid and another not? Despite the claimed empiricism of modern magicians, this is not a rational pro­cess.

This isn't in the books of magic, why? For one thing, it's all too easily forgotten, and for another, you have to find it out for yourself. And those who would sanitize magic, whitening out the wildness with explanations borrowed from pop psychology or science-well, madness is something that we still fear~the great taboo. So why did I choose Cthulhu? High Priest of the Great Old Ones. Lying dreaming \"death's dream\" in the sunken forgotten through layers of time and water.

I'd been \"working\" with Gaia. No new-age mommy with a channeling about saving whales or picking up litter. I felt a pressure inside my head building up-something huge trying to pour itself into me.

This sort of experience helps me to clarify my feelings on Cthulhu. Alien but not alien. A vast bulk stir­somewhere around the oit of my stomach.

Familiar because of the thousand and one books that chart it, analyse it, and, in some cases, offer sign­posts along the way. Which brings me back to why 1 chose Cthulhu, or rather, why we chose each other. There's something very romantic about H.P Lovecraft. The same romance which brings people to­wards magic by reading Dennis Wheatley. As Lionel Snell once wrote \"When occultism dissociated itselffrom the worst excesses Dennis Wheatley, it castrated Use,,!for the worst excesses of Dennis Wheatley are where it's at.\" There's something gut-wrenching, exciting, awe-ful-romantic-about Lovecraftian magic. Contrast it with the plethora of books available on different magical \"systems\" which abound in modem bookshops. Symbols everywhere-every­has become a symbol, and somehow, (to my mind at least), less real. Awesome experiences have bad all the feeling boiled out of into short descriptions and lists-always more lists, charts, and attempts to banish the unknown with explanations, equations, ab­stract structures for otber people to play in. magic is elementaL, it has an immediate presence, and resonates with buried fears, longings, aspirations and dreams. 11"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"The Great Old Ones and their kin can only ever be fragments of the mysterious, never to be codified or dried out for scholars to pick over.

It may not be nice to hear, but unfortu­nately one of the attractions of the occult for some people is that you can convince yourself that you are a mighty adept whilst everyone else is continually amazed at your total ineptitude on planes more solid than the astral. The reason I am saying this is wben I first started doing magick, and in the Cthulhu Mythos entities. It's through, like having zits or to grow out of it. 15 "},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Antinomianism Cthulhu Mythos magick can contribute to the development of an Antinomian stance. A core principle of Chaos Magick is that contin­ued deployment of antinomian techniques upon yourself is vital to magical development, hcnce the various Libers of Crowley, and the stress placed on metamorphosis and liberation in Liber NuU, to name but two sources. The criteria for sllccess with You can stance practice is associated with the concept of becoming \"alien\"-sornething which again has a romantic glamour. But becoming \"alien\" is much more than a matter of dressing in strange clothes and saying \"beep beep\" to people (or \"Hail Shub-Niggurath,\" if you prefer). No, look again at the movies and horror-stories. Often, the most successful aliens are the ones who blend into the crowd. So how does the Cthulhu Mythos this process?

Now this sort of can easily lead to you end up if you misunderstood the says that a on the so many choose a life of self-imposed poverty to one of indulgent opulence as a way of being mystic, we may never know. Fortunately, good magicians avoid such a fate. But there is more to it than metanoia-seeing yourself from a different perspective. A core feature of the Cthulhu Mythos is Transfiguration-evolution into a new mode of being, such as a Deep One or Ghoul. This transfiguration brings not only a new per­16 spective, but also the ability to live in other worlds, and a kind of self-sufficiency that does not depend on other people's views and judgements. This is akin to Spare's principle of Self-Love, which I have examined in some depth in Prime Chaos. The theme of Trans­figuration is closely examined later in this book. Becoming the Beast i'\\.l:Ctall:CU to both the and is the process of Souls.\" process has three which might be described as: Fear the Beast; Feel the Beast; the Beast. In practice, this process is akin to entering atavistic states of awareness in order to integrate them within the psyche-under will, as it were. There is a great deal of power in this aspect of the Great Old Ones-the shadowy adum­bration's of power which have been long suppressed and denied, that which is beyond the \"ordered\" universe which we inhabit most of the time. Which is why I so persistently disagree with attempts to mesh the Great Old Ones into magical systems their power lies in the fact that they are \"undimensioned and unseen.\" the dark terrors of the psyche retain their power because thev can never be bound. You cannot bind them into a tfi angle-you have to abandon all safety and enter their world. If you return, you will return trans­formed. The elements of this three-stage process can be discerned in the works of Kenneth Grant, and more recently, Linda Falorio and Mishlen Linden. The Tunnels of Set are but one route into this Gnosis, and I shall examine other facets in due course. Earth Rites The factol's which 1 have discussed above relate to the chic condition of the magician. However, another factor brought up by working with the Great Old Ones is that of perceptual interaction with Nature. At first this might sound strange, as the Old Ones are generally thought of as being beyond the natural. However, as Lovecraft writes, \" ... the wind gibbers with their voices and the earth mutters with their consciousness.\" 17"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"to understand the Old Ones from the perspective of the general western magical tradition is very much akin to that of a sci­entist trying to grips with natural phenomena. As Benoit Mandelbrot (1984) says: The existence of these patterns challenges us to study these forms that Euclid leaves aside as being formless, to investigate the mor­of the amorphous. Mathematicians have disdained lhis challenge, however, and have increasingly chosen to flee from nature by devising theories unrelated to anvthine we can sec or feel. I feel this view is similar to that of western magick, which has a very \"indoors\" feel to it. At least, whenever I performed rituals such as the Lesser Banishing of the Pentagram, I have always felt that such procedures are not appropriate for outdoor work. Just as scien­tists have retreated frorn the chaotic complexity of nature, in favour laboratory testing and the search for microscopic particles, so tends to create an internal Tower Babel, where symbolism shields the user from direct perception of magick stands outside the edifice of symbol systems and constructed hierarchies of spirit. The stress I have pJaced on decon­ditioning and antinomianism serves to reduce the tendency to map perception according to conditioned reflexes. Rather, perception becomes an act of sensuous communion with the world we are immersed in. Perception has been traditionally described as a passive, internal event, with each sense thought of as separate from the others. This is how perception has been studied, but it does not correlate to our immediate experience of perception, which is global, rather than categorised. A deal of magical technique is designed to focus awareness along a single directional vector. The use of sigils, meditational sym­mantras, etc., help to achieve a state where consciousness of is lost, and the focus of attention, fueled by gnosis, is pro­jected forth. I have found that, in working Mythos magick, it is use­ful to develop a reverse talent, the widening of awareness until one perceives all aspects of the immediate environment as a medium for possible communion. Our perception of the environment does not remain constant. Spend a week or so away from the image-haze of urban life, and you will begin to notice changes in your perception of the immediate 18 if the internal word dialogue is replaced long periods. \"Normal\" consciousness of urban life from \"normal\" consciousness of thc Translate these awareness shifts into your awareness of urban living and you will find new vistas of perception unfolding around and within you. You are bringing pcrception of the Old Ones back into the Transmutations One consequence of Cthulhu Magick that has often becn pro­posed is that the magician who aligns himself with this cllrrent is such elements into the human life-wave. This is a very common idea in magical metaphysics, and most magical orders tend to the view that their work is contributing (in one way or to the evolutionary development of human culture. Those who adhere to this view with respect to the Cthulhu Mythos posit the that contact with the Old Ones is a process of uniting the chthonic roots of primeval consciousness to the stellar magicks of the future. This idea can be discerned in the magical writings of adepts as distinct as Diol1 Fortunc, Kenneth Grant and Pete Carroll. Below the abyss. this issue is debatable. Above the abYss. it is irrelevant. [9 "},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"THE MYTHOS AND MAGICK A good deal of my impulse to attempt a work of this nature comes from the dissatisfaction I have felt with other lexts which have to translate the Cthulhu Mythos into an operational cal format. Most texts tend to follow the format of a grimoire-a collection of rituals and spells for the reader to use. However, given the nature of the Cthulhu Mythos, I have never felt that it is entirely appropriate to simply fit existing magical procedures around it. Consequently, when working with the Great Old Ones, I have tended to operational procedures which differ from those inherent in the west­ern magical tradition. This seems to me to be in keeping with the of the Mythos tales, where the sorceries relating to the Ones bear more relation to the ecstatic practices of sha­manism, witchcraft survivals, or voudoun. rather than the intellectual tradition of the Golden Dawn and its Theory and Application Much of what passes for theory is a hodge-podge of concepts, from theosophy-derived maps of the inner to pop psychotherapy and \"alternative\" physics. The question of how much of it is \"True\" in the absolute sense is irrelevant, at least from a perspecti ve, it is the investment of belief in a concept which makes it viable, rather than its coherence. Most occult theories are treated in the same way as general scientific descriptions of the world. That they are presumed to be \"true\" independently of human These are known as Theories-oFAclion. How­ever, there is a second type theory, 171eory-in-Use, which relates to the guidelines and patterns that a practitioner through prac­and individual experience, which eaable him to be effective. 20 this distinction between formalized and personal concepts to be particularly useful when approaching the Cthulhu Mythos. Theories-in-use cannot be taught: they are personal and tend to operate at the level of unconscious assumptions. They can only be learned by the individual by a process of practice in \"live\" ence. In the same way, magical theories-in-use cannot be taught. A fledgling magician can be given theories-or-action and taught basic techniques and application of them, but he must develop his own theories-of-use as part of the process of becoming an Adept. In these terms, an Adept would be the magician whose personal theories-in­use have been honed to the point where he no longer requires any set formulations or theories. r have found that working with the Cthulhu Mythos entities is very much a personal process, and so much so that 1 do not feel that it is appropriate to give out set formulations for rituals and the like. Instead, I will examine some of the magical techniques which are particularly appropriate for Cthulhu Mythos work, but it is up to you as to when and how you apply them. On Banishing The ubiquitous 'Banishing Ritual' is generally considered a key element of standard approaches to ritual magic. So much so, that it is often automatically assumed that every ritual event should begin with some kind of banishing ritual. In other words, it becomes a habit, the LIse of which is not questioned. The concept of the Banish-Ritual seems to have originated with the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, and gone on to permeate most post-Nineteenth Cen­approaches to magic, from the various 'traditions of Wicca to Chaos Magic. In order to discuss the relevance of Banishing Rituals (0 Cthulhu Magic I will pose the question, what is a Banishing Ritual I\"or? Again, the answers to this wi 11 depend very much Oil individual laste, but here are two common 'explanations' for the usage of ban­ishing rituals: \"The ritual creates a fortified and cleansed physical/astral space is a vital precondition for any formal act-be it medi­lalion or further works of ritual.\" \"It prevents the magician being attacked by malevolent forces.\" Generally, a Banishing Ritual consists of the willed re-ordering ;lIld sacralisatlon of space, according to a particular schema or struc­Illn::.

He continually stresses the the door both ways. The infamous Simon Necro­nomicon presents the rather melodramatic warning that are no effective banishings for the forces invoked in the NECRONOMI­CON.\" Some occult critics of Cthulhu magic appear to take this lit-whilst others have rightly, to my mind, it as a of magical 'hype.' For me, the issue is not so much that Cthulhuoid entities cannot be banished, but whether the concept of _ itself is useful when approaching the that Lovecraft has beoueathed us. Alternativ{~s to Banishing The first point to consider is that banishing is cOIlte.ytual. There may be situations when it is entirely appropriate to begin and end a magical event with a formal banishing ritual, and others when it is not. One can only make this kind of distinction through experience. Secondly, it can be useful to distinguish between the two modes of banishing-opening and closing. Once this is done, then it becomes easier to consider alternative approaches to formal ritual structures. For opening a magical event, we might consider other to acknowledging moments transition. A simple, yet often effective approach for indoor workings is to make changes in light. Moving from electric to and then to candle or fire-light can itself create a subtle shift in mood. Another simple approach is the use of sound. A magical event in silence, into which gradually creeps the sound of a flute, gong, or singing bowl. Simple methods such as these can do a great deal to build an atmosphere of tension and the part of celebrants, which is event. In outdoor sound can be particularly especially if it is some away from the immediate site. For solo practitioners, developing patterns of silent movement & can be useful Wilson's I book, Chaos Rilual gives some excellent exercises for devising personalised postures, gestures, alternatives to more formal rituals. 23 "},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"Events as opposed to rituals For the present discussion, I'd like to draw the reader's attention to the distinction between magical rituals and magical events. The term \"ritual\" usually implies some of formal structure, or sequencing of distinct elements (even if the ritual is enacted on an ad hoc basis). Rituals have distinct beginnings and endings. events however, can be a lot more 'fuzzy' around the edges. Whilst rituals are usually intentional activities, events need not be, and can include those odd, spontaneous situations wherein the un­canny intrudes into everyday life without those present necessarily having to do anything intentional. Thus a 'magical event' may be triggered by a ritual or some other intentional magical act, or con­versely, a magical event may lead the participant(s) to enact a ritual in response to it. A magical event can encompass a great deal more than a particular ritual or its immediate consequences. Sometimes, it is only in retrospect that we can pinpoint the 'trigger' of a magical event. Talking about magical events rather than rituals allows us to consider those elements of magical experience that create context and All too often, rituals arc presented as distinct 'scripts' which are devoid of any background-much in the way that a cook­ery recipe is presented, but with less attention to the result. Person-I find it much more interesting to read about a ritual within the creators' or users' personal context-what led them to create or the ritual, their observations on it, how they felt afterwards, followed by any long-term consequences or other results. events can also include intentional acts that are not yet undeniably have an effect on the participants. Orchestrating events When to orchestrate any kind of magical event, I feel it is important to take into account the kind of emotions and sensa­tions that are appropriate to it. Just by tone of voice you can raise in yourself (and any others present) a scnse of expectancy or an ending to an event. Speaking in a hushed tone and speaking in a firm, authoritative voice carry different messages. In amongst the nebulous discussions of symbolism and magical energies, easy to forget that even a formal banishing ritual is a movement, gesture, and speech, and that these are if not more so, than the svmbolic elements. 24 Achieving closure Achieving the closure of a magical event is often more difficult than opening one. Using formal banishing and circle-closing ritual structures tends to give rise to the belief that once these have been the magic 'stops' and all participants are 'back to nor­mal.' However, from my experience of doing magical work hoth as an individual and in various groups over the last twenty-odd years, I have to say that things are rarely so simple. Recovery, or \"coming down\" from an intense magical event may be a lengthy process. I have participated in rituals which have been 'closed' by a banishing and the ritual leaders have assumed that everything was 'back to normal' even when some participants were clearly not recovered from the intense state of consciousness which the ritual helped them achieve. When you think about it, this is not so Magical work can thrust practitioners into intense states of con­sciousness, occasionally culminating in intense visions, and life-changing experiences. So perhaps it would be useful to dis­tinguish between immediate closure and long-term closure. ate closure is the demarcation made to signify the ending of a cal event-what one does to wind down, in other words. This can range from and declarations of closure to taking down any props or trappings used, writing immediate perceptions of the event in a diary, discussing the event with fellow participants, etc. Long­term closure is more related to dealing with the effects that the magi­cal event has had on you. Participating in a magical event is rather like going to a good movie or play. It transports us into another realm. When the lights go up and the curtain comes down, the imme­diate event is over, but we leave that magical space with the feelings & thoughts that it has evoked in us. If we go with friends, the event may continue as it is discussed, dissected, and favourite moments shared and re-lived. Sound bites get used in conversation, provoking laughtcr and reconncction. A magical event may also do this. Indeed, for me, a measure of success for a magical event is that it brings forth new ideas, new connections between concepts, a sense of reconnection with the world. So long-term closure is for me con­cerned with the personal integration and assimilation of the effects of the ritual into my life at a day-to-day level. Of course how one docs is more amorphous and of necessity, going to be different for each individual.

There is a good deal of magical apocrypha-tales of interper­sonal mayhem and downright weirdness-ending with the punch­line-\"Well, helshelthey didn't banish properly, you see.\" One of the most common types of storyline, and one which comes up a great deal in respect to Cthulhuoid magics is that of the practitioner behav­ing oddly or apparently 'going mad' for a period, the cause of which it seems popular to lay at the door of either the fact that person(s) in question were experimenting with the Cthulhu Mythos, andlor that didn't banish 'properly.' I've heard this said about various indi­viduals by third parties, and even on occasion, by those concerned themselves. In my opinion, it's too easy to make pat comments about either 'not banishing' or whether one magical system or another can lead to 'madness' or not. When it comes down to it, the practice of magic leads to change (otherwise, why do it?), and it has to be admit­ted that change is not always (indeed, IMO, it's not usually) as it's portrayed to be, the gradual move towards 'higher' states of consciousness and degrees of superior holier-than-thou-ness. Even the most lemon-scented new age niceness can do your head in, if you're up for it. The underlying issue, for me, is not that we can periodically find ourselves behaving like assholes, but that we take responsibility for doing so after the fact, rather than blaming it on the magical work we were doing, be it alone, or with other people. Try­ing to do otherwise, is tantamount to saying \"god (insert appropriate entity) made me/us do it.\" The Liminal G l10sis I lise this term to group the magical techniques used for willed dreaming, scrying, astral (virtual) explorations and the like. Liminal Gnosis can be loosely described as a passive state of consciousness where the magician allows thoughts, images, sounds, visions, etc. to well lip before him. This state can be accessed, for down and relaxing after physical exertion. Part of the trick here is not to attempt to direct the visions that arise, but to relax into them and let a thread of cohesion emerge organically.

The rapid delivery of vowel/consonant sets at random (glossolalia) can be used to develop a route to gnosis which can climax as possession by \"nameless\" masks which speak in word-bursts. If such an exercise is prefaced by a particular intention, then you develop your own power­words for a wide variety of use and application. One example of this technique in Mythos magick is to enter trance via any preferred method and seek to meld your awareness with a specific facet of the Great Old Ones-not so much identifica­tion with one \"name\" or another, but what lies beyond that name, and, as you slip into that altered perception, begin glossolalia and continue until a sound-burst evolves. Emerging primal mantras can be vibrated in a wide variety of ways, from staccato hissing, to a deep rumbling from the stomach. Experiment and find your own power mantras to evoke routes into the gnosis of the Old Ones. Sorcery The techniques of enchantment for direct results do not tend to be of primary significance in Mythos magick, since the Great Old Ones have little interest in human desires and motivations. However, techniques for the creation of fetish images, totems and magical weapons are useful occasionally, if you wish to surround yourself with physical representations of the alchemical process of identifica­tion with the outer voids. Having said this, I occasionally use R'Lyeh as a \"transmission point\" for sending sigilized desires outward as a telepathic ripple, and on one occasion became possessed by Tsathog­gua during a healing ceremony. So the Mythos magick is not entirely devoid of sorcerous application, but is generally less so than other paradigms. Obsessive Fetishes The creation and collection of personal fetishes, artworks and devices aids the process of embedding the Mythos awareness, and many magicians who have worked with these entities have produced images and magical objects which convey aspects of experience which do not translate into words easily. A Mythos fetish need not be, however, a clay representation of Cthulhu, for example, but any object or item which becomes associated with a resonant state of consciousness. Some years ago I possessed a crystal pendulum which was suspended from a metal retort stand. During one phase of Mythos work, I came to identify the stir­rings of the pendulum with the onset of a liminal gnosis which for me, heralded the sense of \"nearness\" of the Old Ones. This particular state was also heralded with a rising fear of glass window-panes. In such a state, everyday objects or sounds (such as the ticking of a clock) become loaded with a kind of global significance. Into this classification also fall peculiar states of oracular percep­tion, as distinct from the deliberate use of divination techniques. Again, it is very much the case that one is swept into these states-a collision with oracular time which may be triggered by events in the environment-the patterns glimpsed as flocks of starlings whirl between buildings; the meaning arising from the movement of traf­fic; the distant creaking of an iron gate. Much depends on the state of consciousness of the magician, and this will be explored further in the section entitled Purposive Disintegration. Frenzy Although many of the magical techniques alluded to in Love­craft's work are generally that of the solo magician, such as scrying, dreaming, etc., Lovecraft also made mention of Frenzied Rites rem­iniscent of witchcraft or voudoun, in LoveCl'aft's mind \"degenerate\" orgies by which cultists summoned the Old Ones. This reminds us of the power of the physical forms of gnosis: drumming, chanting, flag­ellation, dancing, and the abandonment of sexual taboos and self­restraint. Such extremes are common in mythic history, such as the Bacchanalia, or the archetypal witches' sabbat. Such cultic activities celebrate thc primal power of the Old Ones, and can be used as forms of communion, wherein the \"walls\" between order and chaos are momentarily dissolved, and all sense of self is negated in the timeless rhythms of ecstatic frenzy. The construction of such \"Free Areas\" is rare in western magick, where total abandonment is extremely difficult to achieve, particu­larly in a group setting, where spontaneity and abandonment tend to clash with the linear sequencing of most ritual arrangements. There have been a few experiments in ordered group work arising from chaotic flow, but this area requires more work. A combination of whirling, low-frequency strobe lights, tape-effects, masks, and 30 31"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":",II sudden shifts in the pace \"ritual flow\" been found useful here. The sense of unpredictability can heightened if, in group not all celebrants know what to expect during the ceremony. Judicial use of mood-alterin£ chemognosis may also be helpful. Sexual Magid,: The use of specialized techniques of sexual magick in to the Mythos can be found within the works of Kenneth Grant. One of the commonest forms of sexual gnosis which can be applied in magick is the facilitation of altered states of consciousness on by sexual arousal, which can be used as it springboard for exploration of astral or dream zones. The use of sexual gnosis to charge obsessive fetishes is also an obvious application, as is the breakdown of taboos and revulsion's by exploring sexual outside of one's immediate references. The possible use of group is noted above, although it should be noted that deliberate to orchestrate orgiastic rites rarely succeed, as it depends on the relative abilities of those present to abandon themselves. The combination of slow sexual arousal and restraint can be used to allow a subject to attain a degree of Liminal Gnosis for him or her to entcr astral zones, and bring information back to other celebrants. Needless to say, the use of such techniques requires a good deal of experience and trust on the Dart of all concerned. 32 THE GREAT OLD ONES The Cthulhu Mythos displays a recurrent mythic theme; that the \"titanic\" forces of creation and destruction-the G;eat Old Ones­have been cast forth from the earth and \"forgotten\" by civilised humanity and its narrow, materialistic vision. However, whilst may be forgotten, are at the same time ever-present, lurking at frontiers of order, in places where the wild power of nature can be felt. They are chaotic, in the same way that Nature is chaotic, and they retain their primal power since they cannot be \"explained\" (i.e. bound) or anthropomorphized. They exist outside linear, sequential time, at the border of \"Newton's sleep.\" In Prime Chaos I gave some cursory descriptions of the entities of the group known collectively as the Great Old Ones. the Old Ones into distinct entities can be of some use when working with them, particularly for the formation of distinct practices and cults. However, for this work, I will consider Azathoth, Yog-Sothoth and Nyarlathotep as separate parameters of a single, conterminous entity. Indeed, the term \"entitv\" is in itself mis­in this respect. The Great Old Ones, collectively, can best be described as a fractal surface that is continually seething and changing. If you look at a fractal form, you will discern clear patterns and shapes which arise from the surface. The relationship between the Old Ones as distinct entities and their overall existence, is similar to that of terns in the fractal landscape. Their shapes, forms, and identities arise out of our interaction with them at any given point. We might well call this fractal surface \"Nature's Chaos\" as it forever lurks on the borders of our artificial, linear experience of the world, and the Old Ones, as we know, have a direct link in the Mythos to storms, earthquakes, and other natural phenomena. In wild places, where nature's chaos is more apparent than the rules of society, the pres­ence of the Old Ones may be perceived. This was well-appreciated 33"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"Greeks, for who designated such as sacred to the wild who might well visit terror or trans-upon those who strayed into them. Similarly, the presence of the Old Ones can be felt within, as one enters the appropriate states of consciousness for stepping through into their realm. Such forms of willed madness will be dealt with shortly. The reader will note that this section covers but a few of the aspects of the Great Old Ones-there are obviously others, but they await personal and understanding. YOG-SOTHOTH Yog-Sothoth is best approached a key passage in The Dun­wich Horror which describes it thus: knows the Yog-Sothoth is the gate. Sothoth is key and guardian of the gate. Past, present, future; all are one in Yog-Sothoth. He knows where the Old Ones broke through of old, and where they shall break through . . \" from the Mythos that the Old Ones have a close relationship with wild places, particularly stone circles. and strange manifestations. In an earlier essay dealing with Yog-Sothoth I attempted to explore, amongst other things, the understanding of this entity in terms of Earth Mysteries research into light-form phenomena-the Earth Lights hypothesis of Paul Devereaux and others. In researching accounts of strange encounters, ranging from ghosts to UFOs to light-forms, I found that not only were strange sounds a common factor, but also time-sense distortion, pungent odours, and strange visions. Peculiar perceptual shifts appear to occur across a wide range of \"encounter\" phenomena. During this research, 1 concept ized Yog-Sothoth as a kind of \"guide\" entity for entering states of consciousness appropriate for working with the Old Ones. more recent contacts have modified this viewpoint. From a of workings (and I use that term rather loosely) con­ducted with one Fra. Abbadon (by Gematria, 63), formerly of the Esoteric Order of Dagon, I have come to understand Yog-Sothoth less in terms of a distinct entitv at the ma2:ician's beck and calL but as the \"outer of an experience into which the magician pro­gressively slips. 34 Thus Yog-Sothoth can be described as the outer edge (or the mathematical basis, if you like) of the fractal which is the Great Old Ones in toto. this can be understood in the \"Beast\" process mentioned earlier. \"Fearing the Beast\" is the response of the magician's sense of boundaries-the prior to the deconstructive work of antinomianism. However, this is not merely a defence against the Outer spaces. If purged of attachments, and experienced as pure bodily sensation without identification, fear becomes an excitatory gnosis which, if sunk into (as depicted in the image The Hanged Man), becomes an altered state of consciousness useful for further exploration. This occurs in the form of the Beast\"-primarily through a type of sensuous gnosis areas of the brain, resulting in strange and the sense of proximity to some­vast, \"Feeling the Beast\" is a process of recognition recognition of both bodily gnosis and higher-order mental images which indicate within the \"realm\" of the Old Ones. The final that of \"Feed the Beast\" is a deliberate process known as \"the Feast of Yog-Sothoth,\" wherein the magician is \"eaten\" by the experience, and thereby full consciousness of the Old Ones. This process is analogous to the mysteries of Babalon in Thelemic Magick, the Feast of Kali in varna marg '1'antra, and the role of Choronzon in Kenneth Grant's elucidation of the Typhonian Current. During this process, the veil of fear from which humanity protects itself against \"otherness\" is lost, and the by-product is Self­Love and the t10wering of what Spare called \"supersensuality.\" To then, Yog-Sothoth is the outer edge of experience of the Great Old Ones. Once the magician has successfully melded himself with this edge. he becomes himself a AZATHOTH \"monstrous, nuclear chaos, the Lord of all the image something which continually, mindlessly, gives risc to chaotic fluctuations and forms. During a working designed to face with it using via possession (The Mass of Chaos \"A\"-see Libel' I have heard it described as having an outer \"skin\" which is a _ mass of \"mad souls.\" It has also been claimed that Azathoth projects and gathers to itself all forms of obsessional thought-forms. 35"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"This would perhaps that Azathoth performs some kind of Logoic function, endlessly replicating and rearranging forms and structures. In terms of the Fractal surface analogy, Azathoth is that which churns the forming shapes and patterns.

The oroblem of of is about this very real is usually a downhill slide into as the strives to maintain an which is widely at with the of his existence. Azathoth may also be understood as the of Gematria will find this symbolism with ration.

In Azathoth there is an initiatory trial not to become bound up with one thing or another, else we suffer the fate of the \"mad souls\" which are its skin. Again, Azathoth becomes a par­ticular experience into which the magician thrusts himself. rather than a distinct entity as the term is commonly used. NYARLATHOTEP In the Cthulhu Mythos, Nyarlathotep is distinguished by its appearance of having and interest in human affairs. This entity has variously identified as the \"black man\" of the archetypal witches' sabbat, as a form of Choronzon-Shugal \"the \" and it also bears morc than a passing resem­blance to s description of Aiwass. In the Mythos, NyarJa­is both described as \"the crawling chaos\" and \"the messenger and soul\" of the Great Old Ones. In the Mythos tales, Nyarlathotep three roles: that of an Initiator into the Dark mysteries of destruction, and that of a confusion for the unwary. initial to Nyarlathotep was, as with the other Great Old one rooted in traditional magical practice. Nyarlathotep, of all the Great Old for invocation, particularly via rites of possession. Experiments in this type of working however, merely served to confirm Nyarla­thotep's ability to mislead and obfuscate, and the entity proved to be as cunning and twisted as a Goelic demon. once more to Lovecraft's fiction as a source, I found it more suitable to seek con­tact with Nyarlathotep through he the astral sabbaL or guardian of various . _ of the Great Old Ones. That it appears malevolent and mis­leading is ul1surprising, given the \"blindness\" of human cesses. Its chaotic presence threatens the of the rigid ego, and its insistence on duality (the Aristotelian either! and linear consciousness. Its appearance as bloated and \"mon­strous\" shapes recalls the tendency of the mind to spawn obsessions and then relinquish control to them. Nyarlathotep, in this sense, encapsulates that stage of the initiatory process by which the magi­cian becomes (often painfully) aware of self-erected boundaries and blockages-the borders of his \"Achievable Reality.\" The second aspect of Nyarlathotep is that of the completed Adept, the magician who has, himself, become a gateway to the Old Ones. In Uber Kaos, Pete Carroll describes the Octarine Onosi:,; (following Terry Pratchett's concept of \"Octarinc\" as the \"eighth colour of magic\") as relating to the development of the \"magician­self,\" the characteristics of which are: ...antinomianism and deviousness, with a predilection for devious­ness and the bizarre ....

It is important to note, how­ever, that mere identification with any mental image of Nyarlathotep will not achieve this state, any more than becoming obsessed with the image of Aleister Crowley will allow you to become the Beast 666. Crowley himself discusses the appropriate technique in terms of the magician reducing himself to a \tvoid-allowim! the \"genius\" to through him as it will. GREAT CTHULHU In the Mythos stories, particularly The Call of Cthulhu and The Horror, Cthulhu is distinguished from the Great Old Ones as their \"High Priest\" and \"their cousin, yet can he spy them only dimly.\" He lies, in the sunken city of R'Lyeh \"in death's dream\" until \"the stars are right\" for the Old Ones to reclaim the world. It is significant that the stirrings of Cthulhu send telepathic ripples around the world, bringing waves of disturbance--visions, nightmares, mental breakdown-and causing artists to images whilst in a dream-like state. Cthulhu is depicted as a form, a vast bulk which has vast wings, and an octopoid head. Revelation through dreaming is a strongly recurrent theme throughout the Cthulhu Mythos, and it is well known that Lovecraft gained much of his inspiration from his dreams. Cthulhu is generally understood as being \"the Lord of Dreams,\" and is entombed by the city of R'Lyeh in the deep ocean. He is analogous to the chaotic perceptions and desires which have been sealed (or become within the subconscious mind. Elsewhere, it has been said that \"we are the dreams and we shall wake them [the Old Ones].\" In these terms, Cthulhu/R'Lyeh are a \"buried\" link within human memory to the gnosis of the Great Old Ones. the Cthulhu/R'Lyeh image bears all the hallmarks of an initiatory state. This particular gateway is under the deep ocean, a wild territory also under the aegis of Pan. Cthulhll/R'Lyeh transmit cun-ents into humanity, and those who have \"heard the call\" are inexorably drawn into the depths-revelation and the summons to initiation draws the would-be magician away from consensus reality. 38 The deep ocean is often represented as chaos, or the underworld This analogy is further reinforced if thc \"sinking\" of R'Lyeh is read as a variation on the myth of the \"Fall.\" The image of Cthulhu is reminiscent of many ancient god-forms who have since become demonized-Set, Medusa, Typhon, Hanuman, etc. Zoomor­entities such as these recall the sense of \"participation mystique\" which has been lost with the gradual development of the individual ego. Cthulhu can be thus seen as another access-point into beast-con­sciousness, via the process identified by Austin Osman Spare as Atavistic Resurgence. As an extension of the above, R'Lyeh can be considered to be an extrusion of Cthulhu, in the same way that a spider extrudes a web. R'Lyeh also partakes of a strange geometry, which, when constantly shift and warp so that tunnels and pathways collapse and overlap each other. This description will surely be familiar to anyone who has worked the Tunnels of Set-and R'Lyeh can be considered as a form of this experience. A image from negotiating the paths of R'Lyeh is that they connect \"both the dark earth and the stars.\" SH{)B-NIGGURATH the black goat of the woods with a thousand young, is never encountered directly, though it is alluded to in frag­ments of spells and invocations. Consequently, this particular form of the Old Ones has received little attention, though the suggestion has been made that Shllb-Niggurath represents a primal [arm of Pan. It may be that Shub-Niggurath is an encapsulation of the terror of wild places, such as forests or mountain country. The embodiment of fecundity and tangled growth, Shub-Niggurath could be treated as a bloated genius loci of any wild place; a teratoma emerging from the fleeting perceptions and images which arise when spending a lonely night in some wild place. Obviously, such \"spirits\" will have different forms and names, and it is the task of the magician to seek these out and, if possible, enter into a rapport with them. 39"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":",I I \" -' .: ~ '\" TRANSFTGURATTONS A recurrent theme throughout the Cthulhu Mythos cycle ries is that of Transformation from humanity to a zoomorphic being the aquatic Deep Ones (The Shadow Over lnns­and the transition from human to the necrophagic Ghoul (Pickman's Model; The Dream-Quest ofUnknown Such transfigurations are related to dark ancestry or an affinity which draws the subject away from human into the twilight worlds of the monsters which lurk on the of rationality. There is the implication that this process is a direct consequence of the realm of the Great Old Ones. this transfiguration calls to mind an initiatory process which appears in myths human-beast transformation world-wide. An underlying theme is that of transgres­sion, which can be seen in examples of this process such as the Greek myth of Lykanon and exile of Gwydion and Gilvaethwy in Celtic Myth. In the magick of the Old Ones, the theme of transfiguration is very much related to the initiation of the outside spaces. In the Beast,\" the magician is deconstructing the boundaries of his ego, and stepping back from his cultural conditioning; at the same time, acknowledging the atavistic desires and complexes which have become characterised as \"evil\" or \"animal\" by society. From the perspective of practical magical work, zoomorphic transformation can be enacted on a number of levels. Firstly, we may consider shape-shifting as a distinct technique for the exploration astral spaces or for trance-induced sensory and kinaesthetic experi­cnce. Shape-shifting into monstrous forms can be used to explorc, for example, the bizarre geometries of R'Lveh or other dream-land­scapes. Secondly, there is the possibility of initiatory ritual.

The Ghoul's Feast The Ghoul's Feast is a variant of the above. It may be enacted from a number of different perspectives, but the basic format is that of spending a night alone in the wilderness, and offering one's body as a sacrifice to the Ghouls. Covering parts of one's body in animal offal may be repugnant, but reinforces the sense of sacrifice. None of the usual magical tranning, such as a circle, are necessary, as the before the ghouls. The rite with the celebrant to consume, or the role of the other celebrants.

Obviously, the key to such workings lies not so much in how or where to enact them, but when. Getting the lj'ear A key to understanding this type of initiatory experience is that they bring with them varying of Fear. This is fairly explicit in accounts of Initiations. eSlJcciallv when individuals do not know 42 what is going on. This is also true when anything in which we have invested a good deal of emotional commitment and self-esteem is directly threatened or removed suddenly-ranging from emotional to maior aSlJects of life such as career, partner, or dominant if circumstances are such that we can do little . And the character such initiations does seem to require that our current repertoire of rendered useless. If nothing seems to do nothing. But by this I do not mean lapsing into inertia, but assess­ing the situation and making it an opportunity for change and adap­tation.

There is a Tantric idea that you can reorient yourself to life so that you are sufficiently open to the avenues of possibilities each moment of living offers, experiencing the world from a condition of \"recepti ve wonder.\" Related to this is the idea of \"Meeting the Guru.\" Not so much a little old wizened mystic at a bus stop, but knowing that any life event can be the \"guru\" that can spin you sideways into Gnosis and TlIumination. There is a similar idea encapsulated within the classical image of the Pan. An early depiction of Pan shows him himself (with intent to rape) upon a young goatherd. This image calls to mind the relationship between fear and desire, rcpul­sion and eroticism. Aeneas Tacitus's Polioketika contains several accounts of the effects of Panic-terror as a sudden and unpredictable condition.

Often, the onset of a cross-roads experience throws us into mental entropy-the mental confusion which Pan brings, which pushes us back into bod­ily sensation. This is a time to still the mind and attend to sen­sations-loose the bonds of the past and quiet the mental chaos of \"what iI's\" and \"buts\"-cease fantasy projections and sink into sensation. Transform fear into wonder and prepare new ties. Transform fear into fuel, and examine those patterns which maintained your thresholds. This ean become an ecstatic process­the original meaning of ecstasy is \"away from stillness,\" which indi­cates some measure of agitation. Again, a key to this process is the to be \"loose\" and relaxed. Holding yourself rigid imDedes the possibility of entering into new experiences. I could gel up from writing this essay, go into the next room and enact an \"initiation\" ritual based on a mythic sequence, but myths are signposts--the enactment of mythic events is not necessarily the same as undergoing a trial as an Authentic experience. Mythic Initiations can, however, provide a eonccptual framework for ap­proaching Experiel1ce--an awareness of the dynamics of that PI\"O­cess~-but they are not the same as Ii that process. So a ritual act of dismemberment that is Willed may not be as powerful as dismcm­berment that is experienced as a Crisis. Again, recognition that one is entering a significant crisis-point is possibly more uscful than trying to force it to happen. If you recognise that you arc entering a cross-roads, thcn work can be done to maximise the change-potential of that cross­roads. Hence, the success of initiations such as the Ghoul's Feast very much depend on the inner state of the celebrant. As noted above, the brew of fear and desire, when mixed together, can produce intrapsychic reactions. Any working whieh heightens such reactions via exposure to taboo areas of experience can have im­consequences, of which one of the most important IS a conscIous severmg OI preVIOUSly-new beliefs and attitudes.

I have described such states as forms of deliberate incursions into borderline mania. In this section, I will explore this process in more detail. Loss of sanity as a result of being drawn into the realm of the Old Ones is a recurrent theme in the Cthulhu Mythos stories. The narrator often fears for his sanity as he unwillingly accepts shocking \"truths\" which are revealed as the story builds to its climax. Love­craft continually reminds the reader that the gnosis of the Great Old Ones is a one-way trip.

Relin­quish the need to maintain control and feel the trembling in your hands. Old-time favourites for neurochemical alchemy suggest them­selves: fasting, radical alterations in diet, sleeplessness, solitude. Linear consciousness breaks down and all that remains is half­glimpsed and vague. Pretensions to megalomania and self-identifica­tion as one thing or another are as illusory as the carefully-con­structed facade consensus reality. Madness and sanity become irrelevant fictions; escape routes that have no permanence. I realize that this might not come across terribly well.

In however, all masks become of equal value. Any other identifications, from Higher Self to Dark Genius, become at best temporary formulations, none of which have other than equal prominence. Under the Night of Pan, there is only darkness. It may stop, but it never ends. Occultists writing about Lovecraft often point out that he drew back from the brink of the abyss, and well he But there will come at time when drawing back is not an option, as seeking refuge in one stable self-identification or another no longer becomes viable. The fear of madness only remains tangible when one has a coherent picture of madness. Dump the concept of madness and open yourself to sensation and you may find somewhere quite different. Such states are sometimes known as initiatory sickness. Much has been made of the similarity between the shamanic initiation and the complex of behaviours known as schizophrenia. Read enough R.D and you may well be able to mimic some aspects of schizophrenic gnosis. I have seen individuals diagnosed as schizophrenic attempt to communicate their world-view through a salad of disconnected phrases and numbers, not unlike some of the magical communications from so-called \"inner plane adepti.\" You can almost, but never quite grasp the meaning there, at not until you have entered the appropriate gnosis.

Suffice to say it remains one of the most powerful taboo areas of modern culture for that fact alone, worth a look. I cannot really see the point of any approach which does not, at some point, risk derangement. Of course, the whole point is to cross the thin line again and again, until you make no difference between one state and another. From point, one's will is uncluttered by restrictive images and you are free to let your mad thoughts out and have them work for you as you will.

In Mythos tales such as The Dream-Quest of Unknown Kadath, Lovecraft created the idea of a \"Dreamland\" (with more than a passing nod to the works of Lord Dunsany) which could be accessed by the intrepid seeker. This dreamland had points of contact with the physical world, and could be used to access of forbidden mystery such as the Monastery of Leng, Kadath in the Cold Waste, and some of the outer where the Great Old Ones were worshipped. Lovecraft's Dreamland seems to partake a sense of nostalgia, coupled with brooding fear of what lurks at the borders of consciousness. Thus, elements of an idealized past, and the fear of what lies unseen on the bor­ders of this space, serve to create and maintain this virtual dream­scape. The Astral Sabbat The astral sabbat may entered via dreams, or usc of the Limi­nal Gnosis. As noted earlier, this is the archetypal witches' sabbat, presided over by Nyarlathotep as the initiator into the mysteries-the Man In Black. It is not unusual for magicians seeking to enter the mythic reality of the Great Old Ones to have spontaneolls dreams of attending the sabbat, and these should be taken as a positive indica­tor. Larval elemental and zoomorphic entities are very much in evi­dence, as are forms on the theme of succubi and incubi. The location of the Sabbat tends to be in a wild spot associated with the domain of the Old Ones, sllch as an underground cavern or forest Once contact has been made with the sabbat, it is possible to visit it in astral form (human or and make more willed interac­tions with its non-human celebrants.

One approach to working with the Sabbat experience is to note down all experiences and, with subsequent attendance, to watch out for recurrent themes and consistency of details over time. The astral Sabbat may be used as a starting point for willed exploration into the dreamland of the Cthulhu Mythos. If you estab­lish any particular sites as related to your work, then these might well appear in your dreamlands. Often, the borderline between waking and dream experience seems to become blurred. Astral Books of recent memory is Lovecraft's escaped from of each _ • cl tomes such as the Necronomieon come from their mythic nature. Part of the rdamour attached to them is that one hopes to find them in the shop, and not in the general occult section of a large modern bookstore. However, the idea of \"astral books,\" encountered in dreams, is well-known to occultists-examples being unwritten books by Crowley and other well-known magi. The general concept is that of access to information through dream or vision. The book is most commonly seen as a repository of knowledge and who knows, in a hundred year's time, its place might have been taken by that of the interactive CD. For the present, however, a recurrent dream-image where forbidden lore may be encountered is the astral library, where the books themselves may be considered sentient. The \"earthing\" of astral books is obviously related to phenomena slIch as automatic writing, channelling, or information received whilst possessed by an entity given over to of one sort or another.

Lovecraft makes it clear, through his fiction, that the Great Old Ones manifest into our world through \"gateways,\" and that these gateways are often in wild, lonely places. Places which are entangled with local myth and folklore, which are associated with strange lights, subterranean noises, stone circles and ancient ruins. There are other gateways too-strange subter­ranean tunnels, wells, and the gates of dreaming, trance, and mad­ness. The power of where we • 111 the worlds arc at their thinnest, where those who tread the path are at the mercy of terrible forces, and must protect with ritual precautions and proprietary sacrifices. Many of Lovecraft's Mythos tales deal with the gulf of understanding between the urbane, rational city-dweller who crosses into such a dark zone, and the debased myths of the indigenous country-folk, whose tangled lore has at its centre, terror. This theme also recurs through history. The Greeks, for example, associated wild places with the power of Pan, bringer of panic terror. Those who strayed into these areas risked disappear­ance, transfiguration or death at the hands of supernatural forces.
