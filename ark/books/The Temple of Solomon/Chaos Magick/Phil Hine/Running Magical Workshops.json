The second section looks at the feedbackdynamics between facilitator & audience. The third section looksat approaches to structuring workshop presentations and offerssome comments on developing Presentation Styles. Finally, Iwill examine the use of various aids and props, and somemiscellaneous issues relating to venue management and workingoutdoors.I have been facilitating magical workshops of one kind or anotherfor nearly eight years, although I have also had the advantage ofrunning psychotherapy & dramatherapy groups prior to this. Thisessay draws together much of what I have observed and taughtmyself over the years. It’s by no means definitive, and as ever,feedback and comments from readers would be much welcomed.Phil Hine, September 1997"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"5IBASIC CONSIDERATIONSThere are three basic considerations which attention should begiven to. These are:i) You (as facilitator)ii) Them (audience or participants)iii) The Environment (workshop space)YOUA) KNOW YOUR MATERIALBefore you go into your workshop, you should know what you’regoing to do, how you are going to present it, and in what order. Ithelps a lot if you have given yourself the opportunity to practicewhat you’ll be doing, if only on a group of friends. Make sure youknow enough about the background of the subject that if necessary,you can extrapolate.B) CUE SHEETSIt’s better to have a single A4 sheet with cue notes on it than awhole heap of lecture-style notes, as with the latter it is easy to getinto the habit of reading directly from them and not looking atyour audience. Keep your workshop notes short, and you won’t beable to hide behind them or ‘get lost’ looking for the page you need."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"6C) BE FLEXIBLEWhen I was trained to run therapy groups, I was given the veryuseful advice that it is always good to have ‘alternative’ exercisesto switch to. This is particularly useful if you feel that an exerciseisn’t well received (so you have to do something about the ‘mood’of the workshop); if you run out of your main planned work wellwithin the workshop time & so have to throw something else in; orif you have to modify your exercises due to any differencesbetween actual and anticipated numbers of participants.It’s useful sometimes to use exercises that can be quickly modifiedto suit the number of people who do show up. You may not onlyhave to make changes in what you’d planned just before theworkshop begins, but also during it. I often find that I run out of‘planned’ exercises before the end of a workshop period, and haveto improvise something on the spot. If you find yourself having todo this - don’t panic! If the workshop has gone well, your attendeeswill be on your side.D) PROJECT CONFIDENCEThis is one area where the “Fake it ‘til you make it” idea doeswork. Public speaking trainers say that if you can get over the firsttwo minutes of a presentation, you’ll probably be okay from thenon in. I’ll come back to this later when I examine Facilitator-Audience Feedback.In general, if you have considered the above points well andprepared your material, you should be relaxed - the fewer‘background’ worries you have, the more confident you will be.You can sometimes get over momentary nervousness by re-interpreting it to yourself as “excitement.”"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"7THEMLOOK AFTER YOUR AUDIENCEYour Audience/Participants are important. It is entirely possiblethat you will learn more from working with them, than they willlearn from you. Bear in mind that the audience want to be informed,entertained, and given something which they can take away andapply themselves. Don’t assume that everyone “knows” what youare talking about (unless it’s a very select group, there will be awide mix of experience from people who’ve literally just walkedin off the street, as it were, to those who have been doing magicalwork for longer than you have). So be careful to explain your ideasin such a way that it doesn’t sound patronising.Also, and this is a very important point if you’re a writer or author,attending your workshop will allow them to decide if your book(or whatever) is worth buying. So your workshops are in effect aform of advertising. Also, if you are ‘representing’ a particularmagical approach (such as Tantra or Chaos Magic) you are likelyto be taken as a representative for that entire genre. People willcome away from your workshop with an opinion about you,your work, and your associated ‘tradition’ - so make sure it’s the“right” one.Remember that first impressions are formed very quickly. Assoon as participants enter the space you need to be in “workshopmode” - aware of how you are presenting yourself and attentiveto everybody and everything. Greet people, look around, check upon final details with your assistants and ensure that they aremotivated and enthusiastic.GIVE THE AUDIENCE WORKIt’s boring if you’re just sitting, listening to someone droning onfor hours and hours. As facilitator, bear this in mind. It’s useful topresent exercises which get the participants working withoutyou, preferably in a manner that means they have to interact with"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"8each other. Dividing the participants into sub-groups and leavingthem to work on a subject or presentation is a good move.Providing, of course, that you give clear instructions, and a timelimit - or people might just spend the time chatting to each other.I tend to give people “5 minutes” to do something but don’t stickrigidly to clock time. If participants are going to need pens &paper for such an exercise, make sure that you have plenty of bothto hand.One of the most successful exercises I have used in Workshopsis to divide the participants into sub-groups using a magicalschema (Elements, Planets, 8 Rays of Magic etc.) and then givethem time to “brainstorm” appropriate gestures, sounds, movements& visualisations.USE HELPERS IF YOU CANNot only is such a tactic useful and fun for the audience, it can alsoprovide a much-needed break for the facilitator. If you’re usingSub-group exercises, it can be sometimes useful to have ‘helpers’in some groups, who you know will help motivate the others. Ahelper can be someone who’s done the exercise before, or a colleaguewho’s turned up to support you.INSTRUCTIONS MUST BE CLEARInstructions for Exercises must be clear and understandable. Thisis something you work on beforehand - breaking techniques &exercises into clearly-defined and simple steps. All the same, ask ifeveryone’s understood, and visually scan faces as well. It’s alsoworth restating your instructions if there are a number of steps towork through.WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT THEM?Background knowledge about your participants can be important.If, for example, you recognise several people as having come to"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"9your workshops before, you can infer that they enjoyed yourprevious Workshop and have come back for more. Acknowledgingthem is a good move, showing that you recognise and value theirbeing present. If you repeat an exercise or discuss a previous one,you may prompt them into giving valuable feedback or building ona point that you have already made.It can also be useful if you can anticipate the audience’s mood atthe beginning of the workshop, particularly if the subject youare presenting is at all controversial. For example, in 1994 I wasbooked to speak to a discussion forum which was predominantlyPagan Federation members about Chaos Magic. Now this was justafter a rather controversial article on Chaos had been publishedin the Pagan Federation’s magazine. I didn’t like what the articlehad to say, and I knew that a good number of other readers didn’tlike it either. So I kicked off my talk by saying “Hands up who readthat bollocks on Chaos magic in the last copy of The Wiccan.” Thisnot only drew a big laugh, but also established that I was not tobe associated with that article, and that I had some empathy withthe audience’s perspective & beliefs.It’s important to bear in mind that an audience is likely to havegained a perspective on a subject from (a) reading related booksand (b) hearsay. One of the attendees to my Seattle workshopcommented that he had been expecting a high theoretical/lowpractical content, but that he found that the reverse was actually thecase.A general point here is that I am careful never to criticise entiremagical traditions or approaches. Saying that Wicca is a load ofcrap is not going to please any Wiccans in the audience - whereasit is okay to talk about specific problems you found withcertain individuals who were Wiccans. This is a more effective wayof bringing a point across since most people will have metobstructive individuals, although this does not necessarily invalidatean entire paradigm."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"10THE ENVIRONMENTThe environment is an important factor in running workshops. Ilike to check out a workshop space well before the actual event,just to get the ‘feel’ of it. The size and shape of the space maydictate limits on the kind of exercises you can use. For example, asmall space, with lots of people means that you may not be ableto do anything too energetic (without careful management).RESTRICTIONS ON MOVEMENTIf you are behind a table, sitting or standing on a stage, or behind amicrophone, you will be restricted in your movement, and again,may have to modify your presentation accordingly. Personally, Ilike to have the freedom to move anywhere within the workshopspace, so if a microphone is necessary, I would arrange beforehandfor a hand-held or throat mike.FURNITUREYou will also need to bear in mind seating arrangements - can theseats be quickly moved away for active exercises? Do you needany tables (for products, taking addresses etc.) and where shouldthey be placed? These points should be attended to before theworkshop begins.BEWARE OF DISTRACTIONSWindows and Mirrors can be points of distraction - if you arenervous it’s tempting to start looking out of them (looking up tothe ceiling in search of inspiration is another). If you start doingthis, it will actually serve to increase, rather than decreasenervousness. Your audience will start to wonder what is sointeresting out there as well."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"11COMMAND THE SPACEWorking in large spaces (i.e. Auditoriums, Conference Halls) canbe unnerving if you’re not used to it. Don’t be afraid of clamberingup onto a stage before there’s anyone else around and checkingout how you feel about being up there. A technique I often use is tovisualize my ‘aura’ expanding to fill the entire space. It can beunnerving being the sole focus of attention in a large room, so Itell myself that I am “in charge” of everything that happens in theenvironment while I’m the focus of attention."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"12IIFACILITATOR-AUDIENCE FEEDBACKBE ATTENTIVE TO YOUR AUDIENCEIt’s important to be attentive to your audience at all times duringthe workshop. Otherwise, you won’t know how what you’re saying/doing is being received. It’s difficult to do this if you’re nervous,when it’s easy to hide behind your notes. If you can keep visuallyscanning your audience, then not only can you see their reactions,you are also demonstrating to them that you are confident andinterested in them.PARALANGUAGEIt can be tempting to read too much from paralanguage (non-verbal cues). If for example, someone has their eyes closed, theyare just as likely to be listening attentively as to be asleep. Whatis more important is that you use your hands to emphasise whatyou’re saying, i.e. use your fingers to mark off different points.SENSING AUDIENCE MOODIf you are Attentive to your audience, you can do something toalter the general mood if necessary. For example, if I thinkpeople are ‘slack’ - after a long day at the office or a train journeyto get to the workshop space, a lively Warm-Up exercise can bethrown at them. Or if you sense that people are unhappy aboutsomething you’ve just said, you could shift to another, less"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"13threatening topic or shove in an exercise to demonstrate the valueof the point you’ve just made.GIVING SPACE FOR FEEDBACKThe obvious spaces for structured group feedback, or questionsand answers, is after a theoretical session or a group exercise. I’lllook again at this area in the next Section.In general, your audience will be giving you feedback all thetime. If a particular exercise or ‘line’ works well, then you can useit again in the future. A trick I have found myself using is, inlarge workshops, to keep checking on one or two members of theaudience, with the objective of making them laugh at somethingI’ve said, or getting them to ‘open up’. This becomes a smallobjective within the entire event.NOTICING ATYPICAL INDIVIDUALSIt’s also worth paying special attention (not overtly, note) to peoplewho, for various reasons, seem to you to stand out as being atypicalparticipants. This may need to be no more than keeping an eye onthem to see if they’re feeling “out of place” or not. It may beworth checking on them personally during a break."},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"14IIISTRUCTURING PRESENTATIONS& DEVELOPING YOUR DELIVERY STYLEA key to successful workshops is good planning in advance, andthen learning from your mistakes afterwards. Whilst I was beingtrained to run groups, I found it useful to keep a “Groups Diary”noting what exercises I used during a session, and how they werereceived.EXAMPLE WORKSHOP PLANI used this plan for the Seattle Workshop:i) Introduction (Assistant)ii) Modified Thanateros Rite - explanation (assistant on drum)iii) Talk (45mins - 1 hour)iv) 10 minute breakv) Brief Questions & Answer Sessionvi) Soundscape (general Explanation):PREPARATIONn Divide participants into 8 groupsn Assign each group a ray of magic (Pure, Wealth etc.)n Each group gets 5-8 mins to work on presentationn Each group then demonstrates their presentation to other groups"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"15MAIN SEQUENCE• Each group invokes their ray in turn• At signal (drum) groups split up and intermingle• At signal (drum) all sit, form a circle - keep sounds going• At signal (touch) participant stops ray-sound, starts “Om”• At signal (touch) participant falls silentvii) Feedbackviii) Follow-Through talkix) Introduce Fra. Zaukx) Fra. Zauk Explains & Leads Bee-Swarm Workingxi) Closing StuffWorking out this basic format took about half an hour, with myself,Fratres Areon & Zauk, & Sor. Kieja suggesting ideas. I developedthis sequence in workshops in the U.K & Austria & knew that itworked well. The Thanateros Rite was chosen as a warm-upexercise - I prefer getting participants to begin with an activeexercise. We decided to close the Workshop with a working fromFra. Zauk as he was the local IOT representative.Other Pact members present assisted in the workshop byoperating the video camera, joining in with the group work andacting as ‘doormen’.PLAN BMy tentative “Plan B” would have been to run the workshop asabove, but use a less complicated schema (such as the 4Elemental attributions). At the Milwaukee Workshop, wherethere were both spatial restrictions and less participants we evolvedan alternative workshop plan more or less on the spot:i) Introductionii) Physical Warm-Up exercises (head rolls etc.)iii) Talk (45mins)"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"16iv) Soundscape (as above)• Instead of dividing participants into sub-groups, we used onegroup for all the rays, and gave the group 5 mins or so to work outa group format for each ray.v) Inflated Ego Rite (suggested by Kieja)vi) Human Balloon BanishingThe Inflated Ego Rite worked well due to the spatial dimensionsof the workshop space, which was basically two rooms with anopen connecting doorway.MAKING THE BEST USE OF EXERCISESWhen planning workshops, I tend to make use of the generalformat discussed in “Prime Chaos”: Opening, Warm-up exercise,Core (lecture & main theme exercises), Wind-Down, and Closure.OpeningIn opening the workshop you’re welcoming people into the space,introducing yourself, dealing with money matters or any specialrequirements participants may have. If you can, outline whatstructure the workshop is going to take - what you are going to beasking people to do, and how.Warm-UpsThere are a wide range of Warm-Up exercises which can be foundin books on groupwork. A simple way of ‘warming up’ a group canbe to lead them in some simple physical exercises such as headrolls, shaking limbs, jumping up and down. Ideally you should selectone or two warm-ups which focus participants’ attention onto theevent itself (rather than chatting to their friends or feeling nervousabout being with strangers), get them moving, encourage eye contactbetween other group members and maybe even making physicalcontact with other members - exercises which involve hand-holding"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"17or touch can be useful here. Warm-ups should be short and not toocomplex, and preferably, fun!An Example Warm-Up: PulsesPulses is a simple dramatherapy exercise whereby the group standsin a circle holding hands. The facilitator starts a ‘pulse’ by clenchingthe hand of the person on his or her right - which is then passedalong the circle. The facilitator can send pulses in both directions atonce, speeding the number up until the group cannot keep up. Thiscan be a good ice-breaker.The CoreThis is your main focus of the workshop - which can be anythingfrom a lecture to whatever exercises you’ve planned to support whatyou’re going to do.Wind-DownWind-downs function in a similar way to the warm-up, allowingpeople to relax, or end the session on a ‘lively’ note.An Example Wind-Down: Balloon BanishingThis ‘banishing’ wind-down was also, originally, a dramatherapyexercise. Everyone (except the facilitator) joins hands, forming acircle, and scrunches together as close as possible. The facilitatorthen tells them that they are a balloon, and that he is going to ‘pumpthem full of air’. At the facilitator’s cue, the group takes huge breaths,and as they breathe out, the circle slowly expands until everyone isstanding up, arms stretched as far as possible, holding the ‘air’ in.At which point the facilitator says “Oh, look what I’ve got - a pin!”and drives it into the balloon with a cry of “BANG!” after which allcollapse."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"18ClosureClosing a workshop space is just as important as opening it up. Thisis the point where you thank people for attending and praise theirhard work in making the workshop a success. If you’ve had peoplehelping you in various capacities, thank them also.NOTES ON SPECIFIC EXERCISES/TECHNIQUESGuided Pathworkings/VizualisationsGuided Pathworkings are exercises popular at workshops. I findthat these are best used before a break. After lunch, participant’sattention tends to be lower & there is a tendency for people to ‘doze’if they are lying down.RitualsIf you’re going to use a particular style of ritual, such as the LesserBanishing Ritual of the Pentagram, Gnostic Banishing Ritual orsome other popular format, don’t just launch into it, assuming thateveryone present knows it as well as you do. Unless you’re workingwith a very select audience, run through it beforehand.Dealing with SexIf you’re planning on having participants remove their clothes orengage in any sort of sexual activity, for goddess’ sake let peopleknow in advance! Give them time to object or at least withdrawgracefully. This sounds rather obvious, but a friend of mine recentlyattended a workshop on ‘tantra’ where, without warning, the groupwas asked to take off their clothes and start masturbating - withoutany warning whatsoever!"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"19Never assume that people will automatically go along with yourideas, particularly if they find a particular issue to be problematic,ethically, or personally. If you are going to do magic working for aspecific end, or exercises which require a deeper level of self-disclosure than some individuals may be willing to go along with,it’s a good idea to give people a chance to voice concerns or evenbe able to ‘sit out’ of a section of the workshop without them feeling‘trapped’ or uncomfortable.DEVELOPING A DELIVERY STYLEDeveloping a delivery style is mainly a matter of finding outwhat works best for you - and to what your participants seem torespond best to. For example, when I am talking about the moreabstract chaos techniques, such as Ego Magic or Paradigm Shifts,I always use personal anecdotes (from my own history or someoneI have encountered in the past) as I have found this to be the mosteffective way of getting the message across. I find thatparticipants tend to understand the application of a technique ifthey can relate it to a concrete example. If I think a particularanecdote & it’s delivery has elicited a good response, I will use itagain. It’s important to be able to sit down after your workshopand go over it in your mind, recalling which deliveries ‘worked’and which seemed, in hindsight, to be ambivalent. Audio-taping orvideoing your workshops then playing back the recording is anexcellent way of assessing your own performance.HUMOURUsing humour has become an integral part of my workshopdelivery style, to the point where I find myself watching televisionor stage comedians, on the lookout for good ‘tips’. I once saw acomedian run on stage and shout “Give me an A!” Audience: “A!”- Comedian: “Thank you!” I used this once at the beginning of aworkshop, and got a good response - it acted almost like a warm-up in that the participants gave me their full attention and I could"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"20almost hear them thinking “What’s he going to do next?”You do need to be careful with humour in general, and jokesin particular, if you’re not sure of the likely audience reaction. Ifind humour doesn’t work well if you’re being translated bysomeone else (unless you’ve worked the joke out beforehand withyour translator). Humour can work well in delivering a message,and can be used directly in exercises. I once did a SoundscapeWorkshop in London where some of the participants were laughingduring their presentation - which can be okay if you that is whatyou want. I like it when people laugh, as it’s usually an indicatorthat they are (a) enjoying themselves and (b) have understoodwhat I have said/done.USE YOUR VOICEWhen one first begins to do any kind of public performance, thereis a tendency to gabble or mumble - problems which quickly getinto a feedback loop where you become progressively morenervous and your speaking deteriorates further. Remember thatsilence is an effective form of punctuation, as is lowering or raisingyour tone of voice at appropriate moments.CO-PRESENTINGI have found it useful occasionally to co-present workshops witha colleague. This can have several advantages to working on yourown. Firstly, it’s useful to have someone else for bouncing ideasaround, and also for debriefing after you’ve finished. Secondly, itcan be easier to empathise with a mixed group, if your partner isfemale. Thirdly, you can swap the ‘leadership’ of exercises andtalk sessions, allowing you to monitor each other, the participants’reaction, and if you need to suddenly depart from your plan, yourpartner might come up with a better idea for an exercise thanyou. Fourthly, a double-act presentation can make the workshopmore lively, especially if you are doing a day-long presentation.Co-presenting is worth considering, especially if you are unsureof your own ability to work with a group."},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"21IVPROPS, AIDS & HANDOUTSHANDOUTSThree points about Handouts. Firstly, it is worth making them ofa high quality as possible (even if you have to spend money to doso) remember that they will act as ‘reminders’ for the audience andmight impress other people for future workshops. Secondly,when you’re copying Handouts for distribution, it’s better to havetoo many than not enough. Thirdly, unless you want people torefer to them during the workshop, it’s often better to give them outafterwards.AUDIO-VISUAL EQUIPMENTOverhead Projectors, Slide viewers etc. can be useful. If you’regoing to use them, it’s often better to have an assistant takecharge of setting them up and working them. Then, if somethinggoes wrong, you can entertain your participants while someoneelse does the fiddling. Also, unless your whole presentation isbased around a slide projector, they should only be used as Aids.Again, if for some reason they can’t be used, this shouldn’t preventyou from going ahead with your workshop.PROPSIf you need special props, such as drums, strobe lights, incenseburners etc. Make sure that you can get hold of them, and thatthey are suitable for your purposes. A whistle can be useful,particularly if you need to direct exercises where people are going"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"22to be making a lot of noise! If you want people to bring propsalong, then this should be advertised or announced well in advanceof the workshop.MAKING A MESSIf you’re going to do anything which involves making a mess -using glue, paper or paints - it’s only courteous to inform the venuemanagement ahead of time, and also to have plenty of cleaningmaterial, paper or plastic mats for covering surfaces, etc. Be sure toclear up afterwards."},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"23VMISCELLANEOUS ISSUESPUBLIC LIABILITY INSURANCEIf you are going to do anything which might possibly incur physicalinjury to participants - such as sweat lodges (there has been at leastone case in the UK of someone having a fatal heart attack during asweat lodge), Fire Walks, etc., then you need to look into PublicLiability Insurance, particularly if you’re going to be using a venuewhich is owned by someone else.GOING OUTDOORSAgain, if you’re planning to work outdoors, there are severalconsiderations to be taken into account. Firstly, you need to knowthe territory you are going to be working in, particularly if you’replanning to go there at night. A friend and I once picked a site for anight working which looked very easy to get to and fro from.However, getting to and back from the site after dark proved to besomething of a nightmare - particularly as neither of us had thoughtto ask people to bring torches, finding a suitable parking space wasdifficult to say the least, and to cap it all, when we finally reachedthe site someone had set up a tent there!Points to look into:•Access to the site (public transport, parking spaces)•Is there a nearby phone in case of emergencies, or is a mobilephone available?"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"24•Who owns the site? Do you need to approach someone forpermission to use it?•Do participants need special gear (wellington boots, torches,groundsheets etc.)•Dangerous fauna & flora - ticks can be a particularproblem outdoors - some European varieties of tickare carriers of encephalitis or Lime’s disease. If youknow that, for example, people can pick up ticks at asite, make sure they know about it, and that youknow how to deal with them.VENUE MANAGEMENTI usually try and arrange matters so that if I am doing a workshop,someone else is dealing with the venue where it is being held. Thisis not always possible, so here are a few points to consider:Good venues are often difficult to find. If you do find a suitablevenue for a workshop, you don’t want to risk losing it by pissing offthe management. Find out what ‘rules’ the venue has regardingsmoking, fire regulations (i.e. is it okay to burn incense there?),accessibility, departure times, etc., and make sure your attendeesstick to them!ADVERTISINGAgain, advertising your event should ideally be put into anotherperson’s capable hands. How widely you advertise depends a lot onhow wide you want to cast your net of attendees. Advertising canrange from announcements in pagan magazines & newsletters,sending out flyers, getting people to hand out flyers at opendiscussion forums, etc., to adverts in local newspapers and evenpostings on the internet. It’s often handy if you can put out atelephone number that people can use to find out more details orhandle bookings. All advertising material should clearly show thetimes of the event, the address of the venue, and, where appropriate,"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"25the nearest train station. And don’t forget to take a notepad and pento the venue so you can note down the addresses of people who turnup, so you can mailshot them with details of further events.SUMMARYThis is just an introduction to what goes into facilitating magicalworkshops. Books on public speaking & image management canbe useful reading, as can books on Drama & Dramatherapy. One ofthe easiest ways to pick up tips on running workshops is to watchsomeone else who’s good at it, and try and figure out what it is thatthey are doing - then see if you can do it too!"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"26USEFUL BOOKSThe Red Book of Groups by Gaie Houston ISBN 095 10323 3 XTalking to the Earth by Gordon McLellan, Capall Bann Publishing1995IMPRO, by Keith Johnstone, Methuen Books 1983.Personal Impact, by Michael Shea, Mandarin 1994."}]
