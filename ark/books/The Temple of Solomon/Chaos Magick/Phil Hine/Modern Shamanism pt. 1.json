The first part of thisbook deals with basic sensory exercises, while the second half dealswith trance states, and some of the basic group dynamics involvedin helping other people into them. Using these techniques will notmake you a ‘shaman/shamanka’, but they are drawing on theshamanic outlook - which depends from an enhanced awareness ofour environment, and the ability to mediate between the everyday,and the sacred aspects of our experience. “Walking between theWorlds” requires that we learn to extend our perceptions from theordinary, to see the extra-ordinary which lies within it. Many of thetechniques require group exploration, since it is impossible to growin total isolation from others.Many of the exercises were originally part of the ShamanicDevelopment Course run by Sheila Broun and myself in 1987. I amparticularly indebted to Sheila, whose continuing work is a spurtowards my own efforts. Also, to the course participants, who gavemuch in the way of enthusiasm, criticism, and their own experience,so that the course far surpassed our own hopes for its success. Also,I would like to thank Rich Westwood for supporting this project,and just about everyone to whom I’ve ever written to or talked withon this subject.45believe in utopias, perfection, or ‘True Selves’ which are eternallybathed in bliss. The striving is the important bit."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"5THE SHAMANIC SURVIVALThe Shaman is one of the most ancient and one of the most enduringfigures in human evolution. Shamanism is the source of both Magicand Religion, and as Mircea Eliade put it, is “an archaic techniqueof ecstasy”. Its structural elements can be traced well back into theUpper Palaeolithic era, and these elements are essentially similarthroughout many different cultures, in different frames of time. Eventhough the surface details of the shamanic world-view tends to differeven within particular cultures, the underlying principles remainsimilar, supplying some elemental requirement of the human psychewhich has remained constant over a period of hundreds of thousandsof years.Shamanism shows a remarkable survival, and there are manyexamples of shamans co-existing with other religious or magicalsystems in a given culture. Most of the world’s healers are shamans,for example. As societies evolve into more complex forms than thatof the hunter-gatherer, the roles that the shaman fulfils is taken upby others. From shamanism arises theatre, religion, magic, art, dance,music and perhaps even writing and language. traces of shamanismremain, in folklore, customs and myth - deference to those who canmanipulate the hidden forces of the world as tricksters and healers.Westerners are increasingly turning to shamanism in a search torevitalise and reintegrate themselves into a world-view which isbeyond that offered by our culture.Until fairly recently, interest in shamanism was limited to thoseresearching into ethnology and anthropology; and psychoanalystssuch as Carl Gustav Jung. Now it seems that shamanism is suddenlyvery popular. Business managers are sent on weekend courses that44the ritual stuff is unnecessary - though many people find ritual auseful (and fun!) way of dramatising the inner/outer process. Sure,you can be initiated into the belief system of a particular group orcult, but the deepest level of initiation is into yourself. Someoneelse can act as a guide or helper, but they can’t do it for you.To pass between the worlds usually involves some kind ofcatharsis; an upheaval, trial or test. The necessary disruption seemsto be the ‘trigger’ for the plunge. This can happen as a result ofyour own developmental exercises, as a ‘coincidental’ event, or itcan be induced by someone else. This last means is perhaps themost difficult and rewarding part of the role of initiator - knowingwhen to apply the light touch so that the awareness of the initiationcycle is triggered. Touch, and then let go - because once someonebegins an active initiation, there’s not a lot else you can do. Exceptmaybe listen, or not, depending on the necessities of the situation.Hopefully that person will do the same for you, one day.In some ways, initiation is a feint at death. A lot of the attachmentsyou previously held on to will most likely have to go out the window.It tends to lower your self-esteem, realising what a stupid buggeryou’ve been. It tends to give rise to the feeling of being an ‘outsider’,which, if clung to, can rapidly turn into feelings of being ‘one of theelect’, a ‘Magus’, or a ‘rebel’ - whatever pose seems the mostattractive. The choice is yours alone - either stay there in the void,or reach out your hand to someone else.We see the initiation cycle in terms of the larger-than-life imagesof the Mythic world. The initiatory journey is told the world over infaery tales, plays, campfire stories to Science Fiction. Two of myown favourites are The Tale of Jumping Mouse, and ApocalypseNow. The Journey tends to go like this: summons to departure, theriverboat, journey into chaos, meeting friends and temporary allies,trials and obstacles, the final encounter with an agent of Change,the return to the surface, and the return to the community as ...?This is of course, the journey portrayed in the major arcana of theTarot, but it is an eternal journey that reaches into all of us; theFool, Luke Skywalker, me, you - everyone. It never ends; - I don’t"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"6include firewalking, whilst the accumulated wisdom of many tribalpeoples is being hungrily devoured by people who are eager tocontact ancient wisdom and a sense of belonging. writers such asCarlos Casteneda and Lynn Andrews have made shamanismaccessible and popular.The Shamanic World-ViewThe term “shaman” is derived from the Siberian Tungusic root“saman”. The word Shaman usually refers to a male practitioner,whilst the word shamanka refers to a female. As a loosegeneralisation, it is possible to draw a composite picture of the world-view of the shaman. The universe is multi-layered, with both acelestial overworld and a chthonic underworld, with appropriatespirit rulers and other denizens. there are also rulers of the principledirections or quarters. The levels of the universe are connected by acentral axis, the axis mundi which appears as a sky ladder or world-tree. It is via this central axis that the shaman gains entry to all thelevels of the universe.Another central feature of the shaman’s world is that humanity,animals, and all other life is equal - the shaman is at one with nature.Such equality may be expressed for example, in terms of rituals toappease the souls of dead animals. The precise arrangement of theskulls of animals so that they face east (the place of rebirth) is foundin many cultures. Both Finnish and American Plains Indians forexample, perform such rites. A related concept is that ofmetamorphosis, being the belief that humans and animals are capableof assuming each others shape. In many genesis-stories, this abilitywas had by all, but it was lost, usually through taboo violation, andbecame the sole province of the shamanka. In South America, themost common doppleganger to the shaman is the Jaguar, so muchso that the words for Jaguar and shaman are interchangeable.The idea of a gateway between the worlds is also central to theshamanic vision. This is the entrance to otherworlds, where dwellancestral spirits and demons. The gateway is often represented asclashing rocks, the jaws of a monster, or icebergs.43never leave the boat - unless you’re going all the way. The triggermay be different each time - crisis, drugs, gnosis, a brush with death- these are the ways your allies open the doors for you - the risk isentering feet first. Death is, in fact, a critical factor. You mustsurrender yourself to death - lie back in her arms and she will mostlikely hand you back. If not, well better luck next time.A helpful clue is to let go, when there’s nothing else you can do.Relinquish control. Imagine yourself hanging above a bottomlesscliff, holding onto a branch. Take a deep breath, cross your fingersand let yourself plummet. If you’re going down, you have to go allthe way. It’s hard sometimes for us to do this - to sit still and donothing - but occasionally it’s the best option. Knowing when notto act is as useful as knowing when to act. You can only get this bypaying attention to yourself & to what’s going on around you. Wetend to live in a sea of words and symbols, but below our necks liesa good ally - the body.There’s various titles for this process - ‘the Dark Night of theSoul’, ‘the Hump’, ‘the Apophis phase’, ‘Nigredo’, but it’s all thesame. This is a time for testing. And you can’t take anything in withyou - forget beliefs, dogmas, weapons, attachments. You’re on yourown, kiddo.A weird ramble, eh? Well sorry ‘bout that, I’m trying to writewith my feet rather than my head. Trying to get the feel across ratherthan easy bite-sized chunks of text. What I’m talking about here isinitiation. There’s a lot of bullshit talked about this term, like theprats I used to meet (not so many these days) who used to say “I’mnot allowed to talk to you ‘cos you’re not AN INITIATE.” Or, “Wellwe can’t give you the details of that ritual ‘cos you’re only aNeophyte” which was great, ‘cos I went into W. H. Smiths & gotthe details out of Mr. Farrar’s latest book.It’s like saying “I’m better than you, ‘cos I read the Guardian &not The Sun.” Nyahh, you can’t be in my gang!Simply put, the term ‘initiation’ is the conscious recognition thatyou have reached a turning point in your development. It is theawareness that you are at this point that is the key, and the recognitionthat you are entering a period of potential self-transformation. All"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"7The Origins of ShamanismThe roots of shamanism are lost in antiquity. However we do know,that given the similarities between shamanistic practices in the newworld and Europe, that the fundamental elements of shamanismhad been established as the first Paleo-Americans began to moveacross the Bering land bridge which connected Siberia to Alaska.This bridge disappeared about 12,000 years ago, as the Artic glaciersmelted.Another source of the origins of shamanic practice lies in thestudy of psychotropic plants. The ethnobiologist R.G. Wassonproposed that all major world religions grew from psychotropicexperiences, and most shamanic cultures have some form ofpsychotropic plant associated with them. Siberian shamans makeuse of Amanita Muscaria, which has been tentatively identified asthe divine Soma of the Rig-Vedas. There are at least 80 differenttypes of psychotropic plants the were, and continue to be used inNorth and South America, and American Indian shamans have madeextensive use of both the red Mescal bean and peyote. An Americanresearcher, R.K. Seigal, has also demonstrated a link between thepsychotropic-induced visions of shamans and tribal pottery andweaving designs.Of course drugs are not the only means of inducing ecstasy, andmany shamanic techniques revolve around drumming, dancing,singing, fasting, sleeplessness, and physical feats of endurance.Shamanic TraditionsThe shaman, as the sole mediator between humanity and the universeof spirits and omens, originated in the very early stages of humancultural development. The hunter-gatherer stage of society enduredfor hundreds of thousands of years. As societies began to movetowards settled agriculture (this being only about 10,000 years ago)then the shamans began to differentiate into a developing priesthood.The hunter-gatherer society is a closely-knit culture, geared towardsthe least possible change both within and across generations. Thisis a stark contrast to modern society, where the pace of social change42GOING DOWNWhat is a shaman but someone who’s been there, and make it backagain. The Underworld Journey, they call it. A deliberate descentinto the labyrinth, with only the thinnest of threads to hold onto. Itcomes to us all, in one way or another. Some make it - some don’t,but it never stops. The summons keeps a calling you back. AndDown.This is a great cycle of transformation. It has peaks, plateaux andtroughs - the movement of which you can learn to endure, and evenwelcome. Change is necessity - to live and adapt and grow. Sure it’spainful to feel madness gnawing at the back of your brain, but maybecaterpillars feel the same way about becoming pupae - driven by acellular necessity into the unknown.Our culture has left us largely unprepared for this process, brandingit a form of madness, to be banished by bright needles & the smugself-satisfied psychologist who explains away our secret dreams,our desires for wildness. The summons is continually being bluntedby those who would set limits on the imagination. ...”it’s not real,only imaginary”...”stop daydreaming”...”you’re an escapist”...yeah,right. We break from the lies, then break from ourselves, and shatter.Not once, but again and again. Not breakdown, but breakthrough...into where?Doesn’t matter how long you stay down there - a week, a year, aday - you’ll be back. Might as well get used to the scenery.When the summons comes, you’ll know it. The journey may welltake years. You’ll meet friends and allies, be challenged, and maybecrushed occasionally. Necessity can be a mean mutha. Remember,"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"8is seemingly outstripping our capacity to assimilate it. As AlvinToffler put it, many of us are suffering from future shock. Thisnaturally poses a problem for anyone seeking to emulate the shamanin our society. All lines of tradition have been broken, and in theWest, we now have the ability to enter any world-view at will andimprint its symbolism on our minds. If you work at it long enough,then the deeper regions of the mind will ‘speak’ to you in terms ofa particular set of symbols. There is a wide range of belief systemswhich we can adopt with varying degrees of success, and the criteriaseems to be that you adopt something that fires your imagination togreater heights. Our idea of spiritual progress has becomesynonymous with the idea that as we change ourselves, we changeour society as a whole. This idea is a direct antithesis to that of thehunter-gatherer, where any changes which threaten the continuityof tradition are viewed with great suspicion.The Value of ShamanismHaving said that, we cannot dismiss shamanism as having norelevance to modern society. Obviously it does, but this very muchdepends how you approach it. In an age where most information istransmitted via print or electronics, the value of adopting shamanictechniques lies in recovering knowledge from within, and also inrelating with other people. Ecstasy can be freed from the purelyprivate domain and returned to the communal. Also, in trying toregain the spirit of our collective past, we can regain a sense ofcommunity with our ancestors, using techniques which carry us backto our forebears on the savannah plains of Africa. this can endow uswith a sense of community that surpasses all cultural differences. Inlearning to see the world as shamans, we reconnect with ourselves,and can adapt much easier to the world around us.41effects. Some gums and resins act to increase skin temperature, whilstothers give off Carbon Dioxide when burnt. Camphor, in particular,affects the brain (in very large doses it can produce epilepticconvulsions), and Tabunco induces a strong feeling of drowsiness.Another common misconception about the role of drugs in tranceis that all you have to do is to ingest the substance of your choiceand passively ‘let it happen’. Well this is fine if you just want tohave a good time, but during trance, your perception must be directedor focused. Shamans often train their apprentices by guiding themthrough the visions, and instructing them in how to appease thespirit of the particular substance. All drugs have their own spirits,whether they grow in the ground or come in a gelatin capsule. Sowhere do the spirits reside? In the substance, in us, or somewhereelse? I like to think that they are emergent properties of ourexperience, invoked like virtual particles from the dance betweenthe molecular configurations of the drug, and the shining webs ofneurochemical patterns in the brain. The substance hits our system,and the spirit is ‘unbottled’. Some of them are friendly, while someof them will do their damnedness to kill you. Ride them out, and itis said that they can teach you much, but you must be very careful.In recent years, several foolhardy people have died trying to emulateCarlos Casteneda - ingesting psychotropic concoctions mixed upby obliging shamans. A friend of mine once spent about eight hourspreparing a certain species of cactus which he and his friends hadbeen told had hallucinogenic properties. It was only after they haddrunk several cups of the resultant brew, that a passing native sawthem and enquired what they were doing. On being shown the largepot simmering with vegetable mush, he remarked that they shouldbe careful as the dye they were making was very strong. They listenedwith growing horror as the native explained that there were twotypes of cactus that looked similar. One was a powerful giver ofvisions, whilst the other was used for making dye. If drunk though,it was a powerful emetic! So as you can see, it pays to be cautious,whatever the nature of one’s chemical aids. It’s very easy to slip upwhen dealing with any toxic substance, and there is also the legalangle to consider as well."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"9BASIC EXERCISESAt the outset, we should acknowledge that shamanic techniqueshave a certain glamour about them. Many people aspire to useshamanic-style practices and approaches to their own evolution. Twothings should be stressed; it’s very hard work and, unless you haveno other commitments at all, it will take you far longer than youthink. The exercises contained in this book are ones that I (and others)have found useful in taking our first steps into a magical universe.As I see it, the basic essentials of the shamanic approach are:(i) Enhancement of our senses(ii) Awareness and understanding of our own BodyMind(iii) Understanding of self(iv) Empathy(v) A desire to engage with others (be they people or spirits)As I said in the introduction, you can’t go off and ‘learn to be ashaman’ on your own. Unlike the Western-Mediterranean traditionof ‘secret schools’, the shaman does not learn in isolation fromothers. You need a community, no matter how small or spread out,to live and learn in. It is essential to get feedback, advice and criticismfrom others. Anyone can declare themselves to be anything, if theythemselves are the only important opinions in their mental walnuts.Likewise, you can enter a particular system and earn for yourselfall sorts of fancy degrees and titles, but out in the big wide world,the only thing that matters is competence - being able to deliver thegoods. Which, given the complexity and diversity of our society,could range from blessing houses, officiating at funerals and40CHEMICAL AIDSThere’s no way that you can seriously approach the practice ofshamanism without at some point, looking at the role played bychemical aids - drugs. It is a common misconception that drug-induced states are somehow not as valid as states of awarenessachieved by other means, and that drugs are somehow less ‘spiritual’.This attitude is particularly narrow, and shamans in different culturesand epochs have snorted, eaten, rubbed into their skin or stuffed upvarious orifices all manner of concoctions as aids to enteringvisionary trance. Even if you don’t intend to take in anything strongerthan Perrier water yourself, it still pays to know about various drugsused in our society - their effects and what, if anything you can dofor someone who’s taken an overdose or is having a bad time withsomething. Sooner or later, someone will turn up on your doorstepwho’s taken some drug that they can’t handle, and ask you to guidethem through the bad trip or whatever. In this sort of situation it’sdifficult to say “sorry I don’t approve of that sort of thing” and slamthe door in their face. it’s useful to have at least a broad knowledgeof the more common street and prescribed drugs.On another tack, you might well ask “what constitutes a druganyway?” We know that caffeine, alcohol and nicotine are drugs,but they are generally sanctioned by society. You can have 20 pintsof bitter and this is considered to be okay, but a puff on a joint ...that’s something else. In the present context, a ‘chemical aid’ is anysubstance that helps you enter a trance state, a definition whichcovers a lot of ground. take incense for example. It’s not usuallythought of as a drug, but it’s certainly a chemical aid.

A great deal depends on what skills you have, what youare prepared to do, and in what directions you wish to go. As far asI can see, it doesn’t matter what system you adopt, so long as thefruits of your activity are relevant to you, and better yet, meaningfulto your clients.A Note on PracticeOne of the aims of the exercises in this book is to help you break thesensory or BodyMind habits which we unconsciously develop. Ineffect, to extend our perception from the ordinary into the extra-ordinary. This requires practice which, in turn, requiresdetermination, tenaciousness, and at times, sheer bloodymindedness.In attempting these basic exercises, you will encounter the ‘enemywithin’ - your own inertia and resistance to learning new skills.This is a far more tricky opponent than any spirit you can meet indream or vision. As you probably already know, it is easier to comeup with an excuse for delaying an exercise just for today than toactually get down and do it.I would strongly recommend that all exercises, experiments,insights and experiences be recorded in some form of workbook.This will provide you with a continuous account of your progress,and is an invaluable resource for you to go back and refer to in thefuture.The Three Stages of LearningIn performing an exercise, we tend to experience three distinct phasesof learning:1. Initially, the novelty of the exercise gives rise to the feeling thatyou are progressing very quickly, and reaping the benefits of thenew exercise.2. As time passes, however, this initial enthusiasm is replaced by a‘dry’phase during which it seems that you are not getting39different innerworlds of the mythic cosmology. It seemsreasonable to assume that the Qabalistic Tree of Life evolved froma shamanic world-tree. The crossroads is another axis mundisymbol, appearing in Celtic, Greek, and Haitian mythologies. Theinnerworlds are populated by hosts of spirits, demons & ancestors.Contact and knowledge of these entities is part of the sharedtotality of experience of a tribal society, mediated by the shaman.This is rarely the case in Western culture - there is a vast variety ofinnerworlds which may be explored. The Deep Mind is veryreceptive to suggestion (after all, that’s how we learn), and canclothe itself in any kind of images. There are numerous cases ofskeptical westerners being stricken by the curses of shamans.One option for the would-be urban shaman is to allow theclient to enter a trance, then act as a guide as they move throughtheir innerworld, using empathy and open-ended questioning. I findthis preferable to other options as it allows the client to arrive attheir own solution, at the same time drawing on their own power-from-within to heal themselves. It seems, at times, that all that isbeing done is that one is creating the ‘space’ where someone canlearn to heal themselves. The alternative is to take the probleminto your own innerworld and ask an ally about it. More orthodoxdivination techniques should not be overlooked either.Critics of the Western approach to magick often point out thatit can become too much of a head-trip, concerned withabstractions and mental constructs. Shamanism however, isintensely physical, often to the point of intense discomfiture.Shamanic magick often involves pain, disarrangement of the senses,delusions, hallucinations and states bordering on obsession andpersonality disintegration. It’s a lot of fun, really."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"11anywhere. It is at this point that it many people give up on whatthey are doing. The only thing to do is to grit your teeth and hangon in there.3. If this ‘hump’ can be struggled through, then you will be rewardedby seeing just how far you have progressed, and will be able tofeel the full benefits of what you have been doing.It is definitely a struggle to get over the ‘hump’ of the secondphase, but if you are at least aware of what is happening, then ithelps you not to give up at the first signs of inertia.38researching Voodoo rites in the 1940’s, found that she becamepossessed on several occasions, and once ‘woke’ to find that notonly had she participated in the proceedings, but that she had ledthe rite! She describes her feelings of becoming possessed:“My skull is a drum; each great beat drives that leg, like thepoint of a stake, into the ground. The singing is at my very ear,inside my head. This sound will drown me! “Why don’t theystop! Why don’t they stop!” I cannot wrench the leg free. I amcaught in this cylinder, this well of sound. There is nothinganywhere except this. There is no way out. The white darknessmoves up the veins of my leg like a swift tide rising, rising; it isa great force which I cannot sustain or contain, which willsurely burst my skin. “Mercy” I scream within me. I hear itechoed by the voices, shrill and unearthly; “Erzulie!” Thebright darkness floods up through my body, reaches my head,engulfs me. I am sucked down and exploded at once. That isall”While possession is quite common in shamanic cultures - it isfairly rare in Western Magick, though actors often report thatthey become so involved with their roles that they ‘become’ thatcharacter on stage. It is a kind of trance that allows us to do thingsthat, normally, we are not ‘allowed’ to do - either by others, or ouracquired sense of our own limitations. It is the spirit which isresponsible, not the person. Accounts of possession can at firstseem terrifying or violent, but in the culture where possession isaccepted, that behaviour is sanctioned and expected. The spirits areknown by the group, and their habits and behaviour known tomost of the human participants. When someone is entered by aspirit, this becomes apparent by their altered posture, gestures,facial expressions and voice. As soon as one person enters trance, itbecomes easier for others to do so as well.Innerworld ExplorationThe centre of the shaman’s cosmology is the axis mundi - the pole,ladder, or world-tree, which is the shaman’s access point to the"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"12SIGHT EXERCISESOur sense of vision tends to be the major route by which we perceivewhat is going on around us. We are continually bombarded to a vastarray of visual images from our environment, and even when weclose our eyes, can visualise a world just as rich in detail and events.We rely on sight so much that as soon as we lose this sense, ourothers are automatically magnified.The first point to stress about sight is that there is much around usthat we don’t notice. Try out the following exercises:Walking a RouteThis involves taking a route that you are used to walking, so muchso that you don’t tend to notice the details of things along the route.This time, try to be intensely aware of all the details of things aroundyou, and later, write down everything that you noticed.A group variant on this exercise is to move a group of peoplefrom one area to another, and ask them to note down everythingthey noticed about the intervening space.Kim’s GameThis consists of placing several objects on a tray, looking at themfor a minute or so, and then covering them with a cloth. see howmany objects you can recall in 30 seconds. Try this with both familiarand unfamiliar objects.Colour CensusTake a day (or even a week) and pick a colour. Try to be aware ofhow that colour appears in your surroundings, and how, if at all, it37psychology is the source of the tranquility of their lives.When firstcontacted by Westerners in the 1930’s, the Senoi had had no violentcrime or conflicts within their community for between 200300 years.Shape-ShiftingThis is a very common exercise - taking on the form of an animalto gain (temporarily), an ability or quality associated with it.Some sports psychologists tell athletes to pick a particularanimal and visualise themselves as it during warm-up exercises -which is more or less what the shaman does, except that the shamanis more likely to use animal skins, masks, drugs, postural andvocal mimicking as aids. The Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawncalled this exercise ‘Assuming the God-forms’, whereby thepractitioner used a variety of props to ‘assume’ the form of aparticular mythic figure, uniting themselves with it until they tookon the power associated with that figure. This can be worked towardsas a group game, whereby people pick an animal and mimick itsbehaviour. Shamans tend to have particular favourites - in someCentral American tribes, the words for shaman and jaguar are thesame. The shamans of the Jivaro people, who practice headhuntingand head-shrinking, assume the forms of giant tarantulas. Evenforms of martial arts can be related to animals - the Crane, Serpentand Panther being three Eastern forms.Shape-shifting is also used for innerworld exploration, both intrance vision and dreams. You could start, for example, by castingyour vision forth in the form of a cat to stalk the city streets at night,and work from everyday animals and pets, towards mythologicaland bizarre composite entities. A friend once cured herself of aspider phobia by deliberately cultivating the spider as her poweranimal, using the very fear and revulsion (emotional arousal) topropel her into trance. Visualisation alone is the weakest routeinto shape-shifting. As a general rule, it seems that the moreintensely physical the method of trance induction, the more intensethe level of trance - and hence the more ‘real’ the experience.

A group exercise that we tried out during the ShamanicDevelopment Course was for everyone in the group to study eachother for a few minutes, and to assign each person an animal, plantand colour which they felt was appropriate to that person. Eachperson then read out their list in turn. Occasionally, people’sattributions were remarkably similar for the same person. It’spossible to use this exercise as the basis of a discussion on howpeople’s attributions relate to the four cardinal elements and othersymbolic associations.From looking at other people we pick up a vast range of signalsand clues, many of which are ‘coloured’ by our own habits, beliefsand attitudes. A way to highlight this is to sit in a public place andwatch people passing by. Look at someone for a few seconds, andthen see if you can make up a story about what you imagine theirlives to be like, based on your first glimpse of them. You may besurprised to find how much detail you can infer about someonefrom only a quick glance. Paying attention to others, and being ableto cast aside your own attitudes is an important skill to develop if36I WANT TO DREAM OF THE MONKEY SPIRITKnock out all repeating letters & compressI WAN ODREM FHK SPIRrearrangeNAWI REMOD SPHRIKConstant repetition of this ‘mantra’ before sleep will eventuallyempty the mind of the associated intent, and it will stimulate theDeep Mind (i.e. the subconscious) to throw up the appropriateimages in dream.2) Group DreamsHere, a group of people can attempt to dream of being present,in each others’ company in a real or imaginary place that allconcerned are familiar with. Again, visualisation and mantra areuseful in attempting this. The first step is to achieve a commonperception of the dream, and then, later on, the group can performwilled acts. A group of us once attempted this using the M.C.Escher print, “Relativity”.3) Lucid DreamsLucid dreams are characterised by the fact that in a lucid dream,you are aware that you are dreaming! Lucid dreams are also mucheasier to remember, and you are more able to act withintentionality, rather than just being a passive participant in thedreams’ events. One way of inducing lucid dreams is to strive tosee your hands in your dreams, the ‘shock’ of which will allow youto enter the lucid state. I was once dreaming of my home town, witheverything as it was about 10 years ago; until that is, I lookeddown at my feet & realised that I was wearing my goth boots - theincongruity of which allowed me to enter the lucid state, and, byprojecting a symbol upon a nearby house doorway, I was able toenter one of the Innerworlds.It can be rewarding to try and approach dreaming from a non-western point of view, such as that of the Aborigines or the Senoi ofMalaysia. Some anthropologists believe that the Senoi dream"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"14you are interested in any way of working with others.“Seeing Auras”There is an old story about a young man who read a book about theauras of trees and their different colours. He spent a great deal oftime trying to concentrate on seeing the auras of trees; alas, withlittle success. One day, he considered a Rowan tree, and wonderedwhat the aura would look like, if only he could see it. He thoughtthat it would be a kind of golden, russet-brown, with yellowish edgesand....and suddenly realised that he was seeing the tree’s aura. healso realised that seeing auras was not so much about seeingsomething physical, more a case of opening your mind toimpressions. As sight is our dominant sense, we tend to interpretthese impressions in terms of visual images such as colours, butthere is no reason why we cannot use other senses as well. It’s alsoworth remembering that very often, we see what we expect to see,not what is actually there.35future, or alternative presents. Despite appearances, much of ourdream content is controlled by external agencies. If you studyJung for long enough, you will have “Jungian” dreams. It can be farmore rewarding to develop a personal dream-language, or avoidany rigid system of interpretation. I tend to find that prolongedmagical activity of any sort will mold the contents of your dreamsaccordingly.During the Shamanic Development Course run by Sheila Brounand myself in 1987, I had a dream which illustrates this process.we were preparing for a session on musical improvisation, and Ihad spent the afternoon making a set of claves. In the evening, Isallied forth to the pub and got hideously drunk. I was suprised tohave a very clear dream in which I was approached by twospirits who said “we are the spirits of your claves, these (below) areour names which you will burn onto the wood with a hot wire andgive us butter to eat.” Which of course, I did. This made the clavesa bit ‘more’ than just two bits of cut down broom handle.Dreams are a useful starting point for entering the innerworlds.It can be useful to induce prophetic dreams, or meetings withspirits so that you can discuss a particular problem. A friend ofmine who makes incense and perfumes reports that she occasionallydreams of a unique smell, which on waking, she can then analyseand manufacture. The magical artist Austin Osman Spare wrotethat he would sometimes awake to find himself standing in frontof a finished picture, having drawn it in his sleep.If you’re going to get into dream-life seriously then it’s essentialto keep a dream diary. Writing down your dreams helps youremember them, and is indispensable when you start to evolveyour own dream-language. Here’s some practical exercises:1) Dream ControlThe easiest way to begin this is to choose something that you wantto dream about, and visualise it until you fall asleep. A mantricsigil is also useful, for example:"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"15SOUND EXERCISESWe are continually bombarded by sounds from all directions, fromthe ceaseless flow of industrial and electronic noise, to the slowthump of our heartbeats and the rush of blood through our veins.We tend to spend more time deliberately not listening, screeninginformation out, than we do actually paying attention to what isgoing on. Our brains learn to distinguish between noises that are‘significant’ and those which do not threaten us. There are plenty ofreports for example, of soldiers who could sleep through an artillerybarrage, but be wakened up by the sound of someone sliding back arifle bolt a few feet away.Active ListeningTry sitting in a room which has a steady, repetitive noise in thebackground, such as a clock ticking. If you are occupied withsomething else, you will eventually find that the noise slips belowthe level of your awareness. It can be interesting to try this exerciseon a daily basis, until you can maintain awareness of backgroundnoise, without losing awareness of it, or for that matter, fiercelyconcentrating upon it.Listening is very important when we come to dealing with otherpeople. Very often we give the appearance of listening to others,but in actuality we are only waiting for them to finish so we can geton with what we want to say next. catching yourself doing this canbe a valuable lesson.Humming MeditationThis is a group exercise which begins with everyone sitting in a34fragments of conversation, poetry or images slip across my innereye. Something will well up from the inside, and ideas &connections leap up like iron filings onto a magnet.5) Demonstration of Ability In our culture, you may be able to getaway with impressing people as a shaman because you’ve plowedthrough the complete works of Kaledon Naddair (no mean feat!).Apprentice shamans however, are sometimes required to enter trancestates as a demonstration of their prowess. It is quite common forspirits to test you by placing you under extreme psychic pressure,so that the experience becomes a compressed version of theunderworld initiation. Some spirits, demons, & deities will dotheir best to drive you bananas, only yielding their wisdom whenyou have proved yourself equal to the task. The spirits ofpsychotropics are particularly prone to that kind of behaviour, butI’ll save that for another time. There are other good reasons forentering trance but I’ve forgotten them, so I’ll move on.You can’t become a shaman in your bedsit, in isolation fromanyone else, although periods of deliberate isolation areneccesary from time to time. Also, there aren’t many instructors inshamanism hanging about (not unless you commit yourself to anendless round of weekend workshops), so you will have to learnfrom everyone and everything. It’s important to learn to recognisethe onset of changes in awareness, and explore all possible routesinto trance. Learn to trust your own senses and your intuition,rather than the internal dialogue or what you think you “ought” todo.DreamsMuch instruction can be gained via dreaming. Prospective shamansmay even be identified by virtue of the content of their dreams,and it is not unusual for people to meet their guides in dreams. Wetend to think of dreams as a very personal aspect of our experience,so it is sometimes disconcerting when someone that we knowappears in our dreams. In dreams, historical time is abolished,and distance is no object. We may witness events from the past,"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"16circle, eyes closed. Each member of the group begins to hum, andthere is no rhythm to be kept to; each person can hum at their ownpitch, and rest when they like. It should be done for at least 15minutes, and then the results discussed.Sound ConcentrationThe simple repetition of a word or phrase is one of the simplest andmost effective ways of entering a state of one-pointedness. All thatyou have to do is sit in a comfortable position and repeat, verballythen silently, a word or phrase that you have chosen. After a whileyou will lose awareness of doing so, and it can seem that it is nolonger you that repeats the sound, but that it repeats itself throughyou.Feeling MusicOne way of enhancing our ability to listen is to use music, either ina group or solo setting. A very simple exercise is to any relaxationtechnique and then listen to a piece of taped music. The idea is totry and feel the music across your body, and see if any images, oreven smells, well up in your mind.33Tamang Shaman of Tibet participates in a mythic world shared byother members of the community - its history, myth and accumulatedstories - actualised and intensified by years of training, visions,and rites.Contrast this with the mythic world available to someone inmodern Britain - an island that has been for centuries a melting-potof many different cultures, with the electronic arms of thevideodrome bringing in information from all over the planet,across both distance and time. It is possible for someone to have agood academic grasp of Tamang shamanistic beliefs, not tomention SF, fantasy, mythology, upbringing and the myriad waysof expressing spiritual endeavours. Also, modern society has tendedto hand over the realm of the mythic to professionals: therapists,entertainers, philosophers - and we are to a large extent, cut offfrom participation in the mythic world, except (for the mostpart), sanctioned and sanitised escape routes which supportconsensus reality even as they provide the illusion that theychallenge it. Anyway, all this leads to a pretty complicatedmythic life. Fortunately, some mythic images & processes, such asthe Underworld Journey (again, I’ll deal with this one anothertime) are fairly universal. Others however, become ‘lost’ aspeople forget or garble the routes into experiencing/understandingthem. We rely so much on ‘secondhand daylight’ - reading &watching other people’s experience, that the oral transmission ofknowledge is comparitively rare. The first coven I was involvedwith set an good standard - whenever the priestess wanted toimpart to me the ‘feel’ of magick, we would go out into the open -whether it was a park, moon-lit street or by the sea shore. Direct,physical experience, especially when accompanied by a guidewho isn’t into fucking you over, is better than sitting indoorsreading a book any day! Anyhow, I digress.4) Connectivity This is concerned with making connections -finding links between different ideas and subjects; making acreative leap that brings on a flood of new ideas & enthusiasm.

It is often difficult to describe a particularsmell, unless we resort to comparing it with others. Smells are allaround us, yet unless a fragrance is particularly sweet or pungent,most of them remain below the level of our conscious awareness.Many smells ass unnoticed, unless we make a conscious effort topay attention to them.Yet smells have a remarkably powerful evocative effect upon us.The merest whiff of an odour can stir in us desire, hunger, thirst orbring to mind a past event. Smells are a hotline to memory. Mosthospitals nowadays have “Coma Kits” a range of powerful syntheticsmells, ranging from freshly-cut grass to cigar smoke, which areused to try and awaken accident victims from deep comas.It is worth just going out of your way to notice smells, and to payclose attention to how they might influence your behaviour. It isalso interesting to pay attention to your own body odour, which isstill something of a taboo in our sterile-conscious society. Sweatchanges its odour from time to time, and this is often related to dietand general health. We communicate a great deal of subliminalinformation to each other in the form of pheromones (externalchemical messengers). It is possible for people, as well as animals,to pick up messages of fear, pain, pleasure, and a variety of illnesses.The aura that some people seem to have about them - causing fearor peace in others, may be due to the pheromones they are givingoff. People who are grieving the loss of a partner often report thatthey smell the unique odour of their lost lover, and feel throughthis, a comforting presence. Similarly, many spirits make their32of the North American Plains used pain as a route into trance,demonstrating at the same time physical prowess; while the Kaulashamans of India enter trance via prolonged sexual ecstasy. Use ofdrugs to enter trance is, of course, an important part of shamanicactivity, but I’ll go into that another time.Why enter Trance states?Here are some good reasons:1) Knowledge (i.e. that which cannot be gained in other ways) -this ranges from asking auntie Freda what’s it like on the otherside, to asking a specific question about herbs to a particularhealing spirit. This can sometimes involve journeying toparticular parts of the innerworlds to consult with a particularentity.2) Enhancement of Abilities Possession by a war-god enhancesmartial prowess, or temporary authority over other spirits. Forexample, I had a client who had a recurring throat problem. Iexamined her in a light ‘vision’ trance and saw a toad-likecreature that had swelled itself up and lodged in her throat. Noway was it going to come out willingly. My allies advised me(again in trance) that the only entity the spirit would take noticeof was an even bigger toad, so we performed a healing ceremonyduring which I became possessed by a toad-spirit, in order tointeract with the one in my clients’ throat.3) Communal Ecstasy The shaman provides a very important taskfor tribe or community - mediating between the everyday worldand the larger-than-life world of myth and communal lore. Theshaman becomes, or allows others to become involved in sacredmythic participation. The shaman acts as the guide - navigatingthe secret paths of the communitys’ cosmology.This brings up one of the biggest stumbling blocks to assumingshamanic roles in our culture - the fact that Western society hasan extremely complex pool of mythic images to draw upon. Thisis not to belittle the shamanistic innerworlds. For example, a"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"31She went blundering frantically about the shrine, with the godmounted on the nape of her neck, knocking over the tripodsthat stood in her path.

In the end, Apollo forced her to intelligiblespeech.Entering trance is not always a pleasant experience, particularlytrance states involving possession. The feeling that something elseis using your limbs, & that your voice is not your own, is very odd.The natural tendency, especially for Westerners, is to resist theexperience, even when the incoming spirit is a beneficient one.Often, people who are possessed have no memory or awareness ofwhat happened to them. Shamans often resort to drugs, exertion orritual to temporarily blot out the personality, making possessioneasier.DancingGazingGyratingFastingDrummingSleep DeprivationSingingSensory DeprivationChantingSensory OverloadHyperventilatingEmotional ArousalPleasurePainChoose any of the above routes - pursued relentlessly enough,with determination and practice, you can use any of them to entertrance states. Shamanic group rituals are well-orchestrated uses ofmany of the above options. Only by repeatedly pushing yourselfover the edge will you learn to override the tendency to jerk out oftrance when you feel your control slipping. But the trance itselfis the means, rather than the end - this should be some objective,such as entry into one of the innerworlds, possession by a spirit, oracts of will. Different shamanic cultures can sometimes becharacterised by the dominant routes into trance. The nomadic tribes18appearance known to us by a sudden influx of smell, and strangeodours are often associated with UFO encounters.Memory/Image AssociationThis exercise demonstrates the evocative power of smell. Havesomeone prepare a variety of aromatic substances (such as essentialoils) in unlabelled containers. Then take each container, and sniffthe contents, while relaxed. As you sniff the substance, allowmemories and images to well up, and pursue each image that thesmell evokes.Building up a SmellphabetRather than relying on someone else’s attributions of perfumes &incenses, it is useful for you to try and build up your own. this isvery useful if you wish to make your own incense, or if you want touse aromatics in healing or trance work."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"19SPACE EXERCISESShamanic magic involves the exploration of ‘inner’ space, viavisualisation, trance and dreaming. Equally important, however, isour sense of the space which is around us; the immediateenvironment, and that bubble which we feel to be our personalterritory. The degree of closeness which we allow another personnear us is generally indicative of the degree of intimacy which weshare with them. People tend to have very different feelings as towhat constitutes their ‘personal space’, and it is important, whenworking with others, to acknowledge and be sensitive to this. Thiswas brought home to me very clearly a few years ago, whilst standingin the lobby of a youth hostel in Cairo. I was standing watchingsome Arabs trying to make conversation with a group of Americantourists. The Arabs walked up to the tourists and stood very close tothem. The Americans clearly found this uncomfortable, eventhreatening, and backed away. This continued for a few minutesuntil both groups broke away, muttering angrily to each other. Theproblem was, of course, that the two groups had very differentstandards of how much space to give each other.Awareness of peoples’ space needs is important when it comes tohealing, and it’s important to know when to keep your distance, andwhen to move closer to someone. This very much depends on honingyour ability to observe, empathise with, and intuitively assess others.People who are very nervous or anxious tend to curl up so that theirbody extends into as little space as possible. The more confident weare, the more we use our body to extend our own space.Our everyday perception of space is that it separates and insulatesus from objects and other people. This is a perceptual ‘trap’ which30botched-up ritual, I wished to leave the place where I was staying,but didn’t fancy wandering the streets at 3:am in the morning. So,finding a quiet room, I performed a shape-shifting exercise (I’llgo into the details of this in a while) and entered a fairly deeptrance. Eventually, some of the people present decided that I wasunder “astral attack by demons” and forcibly brought me back -not a very pleasant experience, as you can imagine. The moral ofthese tales is that we tend to have very definite ideas about whatpeople “do” in trance states, and when something happens outsidethis framework, it is easy to do the wrong thing.We tend to think of trance states as very definite & differentto ‘normal’ consciousness. But ‘normal’ consciousness is verydifficult to track down. We move in and out of different shadesof trance all the time, from daydreams to the total absorptionthat occurs whilst performing any energetic physical activity - andboth daydreaming and physical exertion are routes into Shamanictrance.A problem that we acquire from our culture is that we tend to bevery ‘head-oriented’ in our experience - caught up with thecontinual commentary of the inner dialogue, and the words & imagesof the Hyperreal. Our sense of being a stable personality ismaintained by transactions, both real and imaginary, with others.Move somewhere isolated and the self becomes more malleable- another classical shamanic gambit for entering trance states. Thepersonality we acquire sets the limits on what we can, andcannot do. Often, by entering trance states, whether intentionally ornot, we can perform feats or tasks that are normally outside ournormal repertoire. If the self-referential awareness is frozen by shock,or distracted, the body seems to take over, moving us out of theway of danger. We like to think of ourselves as being ‘in control’of our bodies. This is in itself a problem, as ‘letting go’ andbecoming disinhibited (especially in a group setting) is verydifficult for some of us - letting it all hang out is generally frownedupon. In other cultures, however, disinhibition is sanctioned andis the mark of a successful event. Here’s Lucian’s description of aPriestess of Delphi entering trance:"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"29JACK YOUR BODY...The ability to enter trance states is a prerequisite of most magicalsystems, particularly Shamanism. A good deal of a shaman’straining is concerned with cultivating the ability to enter trancestates and control them, for it is in such states, that much of theshaman’s power resides. There are many routes into trance, andindeed, there are many different shades of trance. The aim of thisseries is to discuss some trance states, where possible givingpractical techniques for entering them. At this point it may beappropriate to make a disclaimer - some routes into trance aredangerous - so if you try anything out, the responsibility is yoursalone.What is Trance?A good question, that. In modern Western Society we tend to havevery fixed ideas about what constitutes a trance state - we tend tothink of someone who is passive, eyes closed & limp, or obliviousto their surroundings. We tend to think of hypnotised people (theword hypnosis derives from Hypnos - Greek god of sleep) asquiescent & awaiting instructions. Two incidents come to mind atthis point. The first was many years ago, sitting in a circle watchinga “sensitive” woman enter trance. It started normally enough, butshe began to thrash about and scream - no one knew quite what todo, and some members of the group tried to restrain her in variousways. As it turned out, in her trance, the woman was strugglingagainst a demon, and the attempted ministrations of the onlookerswere hindering her performance. In the second incident, I foundmyself in a similar position. After participating in a completely20we can grow out from, by experiencing space in different ways.Blind WalksA simple way of exploring our surroundings in a different way is todo so blindfolded, being led around by a partner. Try it for a fewminutes and then swap over. Try it again, but this time attempt tosense what is in front of you, as though the space around you wasan organ of perception.It can be very interesting to explore attitudes to personal space ina group, particularly how people feel when their space is ignored,infringed or disrupted. By examining and understanding ourperception of space, we can learn how to manipulate it. As a soloexercise, try and observe yourself in different situations, fromstillness to movement, and how you relate to the space around you.We can learn to feel that the space around us is a medium, or anorgan of communication through which we can send ripples orwaves. T’ai Chi is a very good BodyMind exercise in this respect,as its slow, graceful movements are useful in enhancing the feelingof being immersed in a fluid-like space."},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"21SPEECH EXERCISESSpeech is the main form of communication that we use. we are allcapable of making a wide range of noises with which to expressourselves, but it is easy to undervalue the power of our voices. Thevoice is an important carrier of power, from sacred chants to workingsongs, prayer to battle chants - all have a powerful affect on us.As the word ‘en-chant-ment’ suggests, the voice has long beenassociated with magical effects. Songs, chants, invocations, prayersand even nursery rhymes can be found in all cultures as ways ofraising power, especially when combined with dance and music.Use of the VoiceThe way in which we use our voices is a powerful way of projectingour personalities. the way in which we deliver speech in a givensituation can reveal many things (both to ourselves and others) aboutour feelings. To use speech effectively we must be:(i) Confident(ii) Aware of others(iii) Relaxed(iv) Clear in our thoughts(v) Aware of how speech affects a situation.With practice and experience, we can learn to use our voices sothat we can carry emotions and feelings to others, ranging fromstirring people to enthusiasm and action, to lulling gently intorelaxation using soft words and tones.28commanded attention. This was deliberate, since teaching mask-work can involve people entering trance-states bordering onpossession. In this sort of situation, a group leader is definitelyrequired, to act as an ‘anchor’ for the situation, giving groupmembers the confidence to ‘let go’, knowing that someone is incontrol of the situation and will not let it get out of hand. Once wehad finished the mask workshop, however, I dropped the seriousleader role and when back to being more nondirective. It seems tobe easier to move from playing relaxed to serious, than from playingserious to relaxed. I’ve noticed this in films of tribal ceremonies,where the shamans orchestrating the ritual can be at times quiteindulgent to the whims of their performers, and at others, keeping atight rein on the situation."},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"27the earth in mortal guise. The fool-king, who is accorded great statusfor a day and then ritually sacrificed, appears in many differentcultures, from Europe to the Aztec civilisation. This theme isparticularly well-treated in the pagan classic, The Wicker Man. Inthis film, the policeman ‘victim’ is given very high status - as onlya very high status sacrifice will appease the gods.It is useful for the shamanic practitioner to become adroit atshifting status to suit a particular situation. One problem is that wetend to develop a particular status projection, and manoeuvrerourselves into a position where we can adopt it and thereby feelsafe. A Shamanka in her own culture is automatically ascribed agreat deal of high status by her people and so her different roles arestill based on that status. Also, it is part of the shaman’s role tomomentarily disrupt the status conventions of the tribal culture.Perhaps the nearest figure we have to this is the comedian or streetperformer. In our culture, anyone can declare themselves to be ashaman, but this won’t automatically mean that you are accordedhigh status. This will depend very much on the situation, how muchyou are able to project yourself, and also being good at what youdo. If you are truly competent, then your clients will accord youhigh status. I’m not saying that your clients should worship the dustbeneath your feet, but on the other hand, if they don’t have muchfaith in your ability to help them, then working with them can bemore difficult. A good deal of practical shamanism depends on yourpersonal charisma, and how you use it.One example where status shifts play a key role is in leadinggroups. Now it is currently fashionable for group leaders to take avery non-directive approach to organisation. This is fine if you wantpeople to relax and feel at ease with what they are doing, but it’s notalways appropriate. Whilst co-running the Shamanic DevelopmentCourse for example, I tended to play down the role of leader.However, when we came to do a workshop on Masks, I deliberatelychanged my approach - adopting a more serious bearing, standingup rather than sitting, and generally behaving in a way that22Group ChantsGroup Chants are one of the most effective ways of raising power,and can range from the simple “We are at one with the infinite Sun,forever, forever, forever” to the more complex “Darksome Nightand Shining Moon” chant used by Wiccans. whatever the ideas thechant expresses, a rhythm is soon built up, which carries everyonealong with it.The Spinning MantraIn a normal group chant, each member of the group repeats thewhole verse. In the ‘Spinning Mantra’ however, one person intonesthe first line, a second, the second line, and so on. One note is usedthroughout, with the same syllables stressed on each line (forexample, the second and fourth syllables on each line). A variant onthis chant is to begin with the group sitting in a circle, then haveeach person stand up one by one, and begin to wander around,stopping in front of each other and keeping the chant going.GibberishFor this exercise, find a partner and choose a theme for aconversation. No recognisable words can be used, and the aim is totry and develop expression using tone and inflection to conveymessages.You will find it useful to explore the different ways in which youcan use your voice. Using a tape recorder to give yourself an instantreplay is useful. Most people seem to start out using songs, chants,and invocations that have been written by someone else, buteventually, once you have built your confidence up, you can moveto using words which come spontaneously to mind. Only sheerpractice will do this for you, but the voice is one of our most powerfulprojective tools for propelling ourselves, and others, into trance."},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"23TOUCH EXERCISESOur sense of touch - being able to feel pressure, heat, and texture, issomething that we tend to take for granted. we only realise howmuch we rely on it, when it is lost to some part of the body. Touch isimportant in both survival and communication, particularly intimatecommunication. Speech is more of a social means of communication,whereas touch is much more intimate & personal. A single touchcan carry more meaning than a thousand words. When gentle wordsand touch are combined, they can transport us to others worlds - inrelaxation, sleep, visions, or the illumined darkness of lovers.Enhancing the sensitivity of our awareness of touch is very useful,since it often becomes the dominant sense in healing, propellingothers into trance, and psychically examining objects and places. Itis well known that when we lose our vision, our sensitivity to tactileimpressions is greatly increased, so a good starting point is to workin darkness, or blindfolded.Blind ExplorationsA beginning group exercise is to have people pair off and sit facingeach other. Both then close their eyes, and one person gently exploresthe others hands using their fingers - allowing impressions & imagesto arise in their minds. If people feel comfortable in doing this, thenfaces can be explored as well.Another useful exercise is to examine objects (both familiar andunfamiliar) in darkness, or to try and assemble interlocking puzzles.Seeing through the SkinIt is possible to see using your hands. many healers develop this26These sorts of transactions go on all the time. Stephen Potter calledthem examples of “OneUpManship” in a series of humorous books- well worth reading if you want to look at this subject in moredetail.A further complication is that not only do we go throughcontinuous status shifts, but we tend to ascribe status onto otherpeople in accordance with our expectations. As a therapy studentstudying medicine, I often walked around hospital corridors in awhite coat. I was often mistaken for a doctor, both by visitors andother staff, and accorded high status as a consequence. I just foundthis embarrasing, but a friend who had more confidence, took towandering round with a couple of thick books in his pockets, and aname tag that he had acquired somewhere. People automaticallythought he was a doctor, given his dress and air of completeassurance, and never thought to ask him why he was in a particularplace - which was often somewhere which was out of bounds tostudents.Conversely, some people go out of their way to disguise or rejectthe high status that others project upon them. This is a favouritetrick amongst Zen Masters, who answer a students’ erudite questionswith humour or seeming nonsense.“Master, does a duck have Bhudda-nature?” “Quack.”Gurus and DisciplesThis is a two-player game to demonstrate status shifts and how wetend to collude with each other when we play them. One player is aGuru, licensed to pontificate on all manner of subjects, while theother is the disciple, who asks awed questions and hangs on themaster’s every word. After trying this for a few minutes, swap theroles around. the game can also be played using gibberish insteadof speech.The lowering and raising of status for a sacred purpose is verycommon throughout all cultures. Popular myths often feature theking who changes places with a beggar, or the god who comes to"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"24ability, and it involves placing your hand at a point on the clients’body and letting impressions well up in your mind. It is not unusualto see trauma or pain as a knotted bolus or jagged spike, which canthen be removed. Possibly the hardest part is learning to relax sothat your mind opens up to the fleeting sensory impressions. Atfirst it feels like guessing, but practice will develop your confidence.Colour SensingCut out squares of coloured paper, and have someone else arrangethem on a table so that you do not know the sequence, and thenhave them devise some sort of covering over the table, under whichyou can slip your hands. Try and feel with your hands for the colourof the paper - call out the colour you feel, and see if the square youpull out is that colour. This exercise may take a good deal of practice,as you have to learn to sense the different feelings in your hands,and learn to associate them with particular colours.Sensitising the HandsThis exercise is used as a warm-up before working with your hands,for example in healing, massage, or working with crystals. Beginby rubbing your hands together briskly, and then feeling an energyfield between them, like a ball. try stretching and compressing theball, and bringing your hands further apart until you can no longerfeel it. This helps you to focus your awareness into your hands.Using touch is not only a matter of sensitivity, but also knowinghow, when, and where to touch someone. Some people like to betouched, while others do not, and only by allowing yourself tobecome sensitive to others, will you be able to judge how to act in aparticular situation. One of the best ways to learn to develop thissense is with a lover. in the post-coital afterglow, all the senses aremagnified, as is one’s sensitivity and empathy. By exploring touchin this most intimate of settings, we can learn how to develop thesense, and use it in other situations.25STATUS SHIFTSIt is well known that the shaman encompasses many different roles- such as that of trickster, sacred clown, healer, mediator and sorceror.it is one thing to know of these different facets, but quite another toactually assume them in a practical situation. this requires not onlyconfidence, insight and empathy, but also some kind of acquiredskill in knowing how to present and project yourself in differentroles. One of the basic ways of approaching this is to look at StatusShifts.We move through status shifts all the time, and tend not to be tooaware of this, unless we move into a situation where the apparentdifference in status is quite marked, such as in teacherpupil, healer-client, speaker-audience interactions. Status is concerned with howwe present ourselves in a given situation; our stance, tone of voice,words we use, eye contact and gestures. someone who is attemptingto raise their status in a situation tends to raise their voice, attemptto catch people’s eye, make witty remarks and generally boost theirposition. A great deal depends on what you say, and the way inwhich you say it. Here’s an example:A: What are you reading?B: Weaving the Web.A: Oh yes. I’ve read it. It’s not bad for a beginners book.Here, A is using the subject matter to raise his status in relation toB. If A wanted to lower his status, the conversation could go likethis:A: What are you reading?B: Weaving the WebA: Really? I’ve always wanted to read that."}]
