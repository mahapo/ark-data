My first lengthyforay into this much-misunderstood aspect of magic was apersonal magical retirement inspired by accounts of magiciansworking the Abra-melin system, but perhaps more influencedin execution by the work of Austin Osman Spare and theIndustrial art movement. My experiences in this retirement arerecounted in the first essay, Howling. At the core of this essay isthe identification of cognitive-emotional-behavioural constructsas discrete entities - Personal Demons, if you will - a subjectwhich I have dealt with in more user-friendly detail in CondensedChaos (New Falcon Publications, 1995). The next phase of workconcerned the evocation of Servitors (lit: a person who servesanother), prompted by a brief paragraph in Peter J. Carrollísbook, Liber Null (Morton Press, 1978). Working with the magicalgroup, Circle of Stars, I developed a simple, generic approach tocreating and evoking magical servitors. The basics of thisapproach are presented in the Servitors essay, followed by bothan example of a rather successful servitor, and an approach towhat I have chosen to call, ìFunctional Spiritsî which requiresno ritual trappings whatsoever. The third phase of workconcerned the more ëtraditionalí forms of evocation. Togetherwith a colleague, Fra. GosaA, I embarked on a ìGoetia Projectî- the aim being to experiment with various approaches to theevocation of spirits, beginning with the Lesser Key of Solomonthe King. Some observations on our results with the entities ofthe Lesser Key of Solomon are enclosed.During this project, I found my interests returning to a recurrentobsession - the entities of the Cthulhu Mythos. The final essay,Evoking Yog-Sothoth, (originally written for the journal of theEsoteric Order of Dagon) is an attempt to pull together a"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"6theoretical model relating to mythos entities, earth lights, andother factors. At the time of writing this, I was very much intocreating ëtheoretical modelsí prior to embarking on practicalprojects.In a way, I was prompted to ëspecialiseí in methods of Evocationby virtue of the fact that at the time, I hadnít encountered muchin the way of useful information concerning this magical practice.In the minds of some occultists, evocation seems inextricablylinked with ëcalling up demonsí and the notion that it constitutesëblack magicí - a notion much in favour with those who havebeen exposed to too many Dennis Wheatley novels! Fortunately,the rise of a more eclectic approach to practical magic, in whichI feel the so-called Chaos Magic movement has palyed asignificant part, has done much to banish the old dogmassurrounding what is after all, a very practical and useful set ofmagical techniques.Phil Hine, March 1998"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"7HowlingìMayhem speaks louder than words.îBrother Moebius B., L.O.O.N.The Babblogue:A deliberate derangement of the senses - orchestrating a personalcacophony; a descent into the depths of the subconscious, toconfront and bind the ëlurkersí within.This essay is a short account of a personal exploration of theëdemonsí of my own psyche. Rather than relying on existingapproaches, for the reasons given below, I preferred to developa purely personal approach. I give this account not to foist thisparticular approach onto others, but in the hope that it willassist those who are experimenting with different techniques.Nor do I wish to invalidate the traditional systems of Goeticmagic, merely to say that while some may be satisfied to followthe maps of Abra-Melin or Crowley, this is not the case for me.This work began fairly innocuously, with the compilation ofa ëblack bookí - a dissection of self, in terms of habits,shortcomings, faults, hopes, ideals, all that I was, that I wishedto be, or rejected. Likes, dislikes, attractions and revulsions.Then on to self-portraits; written in the third person - positive,negative, neutral portrayals, a curriculum vitae, an obituary. Tothis was added a ìBook of Blundersî - every mistake orembarrassing moment that could be dredged up, cuttings fromschool reports, photographs and letters which brought backpainful memories.Choice extracts from this catalogue were read onto tapes, andthe tapes scrambled together to form cut-up sequences.

Seclusion fromothers, as of old, a necessity - that oneís demons do not troublethe unwary visitor, and more practically, that one is not chancedupon, mistaken for a psychotic, and incarcerated.As for food, I decided to rely on simple nutritious fare,sustaining and easy to prepare, with a stack of Pot Noodles aschemical aids. Drugs? Who needs them? Still, a selection ofnatural substances can aid things along.The Temple: black, unadorned, windowless, but notuncluttered! Around its confines I heaped all kinds of junk.Sheets of hardboard, rubbish from a building skip, a bucket ofclay, bottles, broken radio sets, a spray-gun. Everything I mightneed, plus a few more things besides.Bringing forth the dweller within - its name is legion.I was preparing for a descent into the labyrinth, to make knownmy ëforgotten onesí, with only the thinnest of cords with whichto map the maze.Why risk insanity in such a way?

Some loose structure being required (or soI thought), I devised a hierarchy based on the work ofpsychologist Abraham Maslow - ranging from ësurvival demonsísuch as hunger or thirst, working up towards ëEgoí demons - theneed for self-respect or a particular self-image, and more abstractconceptions: the hunger for knowledge or wisdom. The deeperthe level of the hierarchy, the more primal the desires and urges.The techniques: flooding and vomiting (eating and excreting)- to flood awareness with specific images, to bring forth (evoke)the demon, giving it form, ìfleshî and eventually a name or a"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"9sigil. The scrambled personality tapes were to act as auditorysigils - storms of emotion whipped up by intensive remembering(replaying) sets of memories.

By these means theForgotten Ones take shape.

The red lines of the yantra-circuit on the floor seem at that moment to be particularlymocking and indifferent to my efforts.

Some I was able togive names to - ìyou are Uul, the fear of failureî, ìyou areHamal, guilt not yet erased.î This was the beginning of theformation of an alphabet of binding.The second half of this operation consisted of experimentingwith this alphabet, binding the demons into magical weaponsfor later use.

Thegrimoires seem to imply that if Hell exists, then it is abureaucracy, and so by the same token, Earthly bureaucraciesare demonic structures - as anyone who has had any dealingswith the DHSS will readily testify.The hierarchy used in the Babblogue was developed by thepsychologist Abraham Maslow, to show how the various levelsof ëneedí influence behaviour and motivation. His hierarchyof Human Needs is a pyramid of desires, ranging frombiological survival needs (food, shelter, etc.) to more complexneeds:Biologicalhunger, thirst, warmthSafetyi.e. freedom from fearAffiliativeto be given considerationEsteemstatus, praise, belongingCognitiveintellectual stimulationAestheticculture, artSelf-Actualizationself-knowledgeAccording to Maslow, the needs at one level must be at leastpartially fulfilled before those on the next level becomeimportant - so aesthetic needs are not usually high on the listwhen one is starving. One can become ëpossessedí by oneíssurvival demons, and consequentially able to perform actionsone would otherwise not consider. Air crash survivors resortingto cannibalism is an extreme example of this.In attempting to strip away the layers of my own psyche inthis way, I was struck by the ëRussian-dollí nature of the demons- that the roots of a cognitive value could be traced downwardsinto the levels of self-esteem, affiliation, and survival needs."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"11This idea seems to be implied in the zoomorphic image of theman-beast. If we deny our demons then they are indeed ëoutsideíand the self becomes a fortress, for an army at war with itself. Incontrast, the Babblogue is a trial by catharsis, to understandand unify the dwellers within, rather than deny or subjugatethem.The Shamanís JourneyThe central theme of all ëmagical retirementsí of this nature isthe journey within. Shamans world-wide, and the most powerfulreligious myths are concerned with this descent into chaos - theconfrontation with death, the demon feast, trial by fire,communion with the dead - and the subsequent return - therealisation of power, and the subsequent return to Human affairsas an initiate. The core elements in this process can besummarised as follows:Phase of Departure: Summons to depart, seperation frommundane life, descent.Phase of Initiation: Ordeals, the labyrinth, womb, whalesí belly,guides and allies.Illumination/TransformationPhase of Return: Rebirth, return to world.MasteryAwareness of this process is a central theme of thecontemporary approach to development which has come to beknown as Chaos Magick, an approach which focuses on theexamination and removal of belief structures, the culturalconditioning which defines our experience of the world.Deliberate self-wounding, to facilitate a return to the ëunioníwith Cosmos and Chaos that we initially feel that we have ëlostí.The benefits of this experience is an increased ability to survive,not by fighting the environment or becoming passively resignedto what happens to you, but understanding the basic unity ofself and environment, and the extent to which one can be aself-determining agent."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"12Further Reading:Nightside of Eden - Kenneth GrantShamanic Voices - Joan HalifaxThe Great Mother - NeumannFear & Loathing in Las Vegas - Hunter S.

In the WesternEsoteric Tradition, such entities are sometimes referred to asëThought-Formsí, whilst in Tibetan magic, for example, theyare known as ëTulpasí. Servitors can be usefully deployed toperform a wide range of tasks or functions on your behalf.Servitors can be created to work with one particular situationor event or, alternatively, Servitors can be created which have ageneral provenance in one area, such as healing. There are a number of advantages to using more generalisedServitors. Firstly, they can be regarded as ëexpertí systems whichlearn from being given a task to execute - as if the more healingtasks you give a servitor, the better it seems to become at healing.Secondly, continued use of the Servitor, with successful results,builds up ìconfidenceî in itís activity on the part of those whouse it. With a more generalised Servitor, anyone who knows itsactivation sequence (such as a mantra, sigil, or visualisationsequence) can employ it to work at a given task. One exampleof this form of Servitor is the entity ICANDOO. ICANDOO(ìI-can-doî) was created at an open group workshop in Servitorcreation. The name of the Servitor was also its mantra forsummoning it, and itís general brief was to assist those whoused it for overcoming any obstacles that crossed them.ICANDOO was created by a group of 12 people, and all ofthem used the Servitor throughout the day, to assist them withproblems of one sort or another. In the design sequence, theServitor was given the ability to divide itself holographically, sothat each segment contained the powers and abilities of theoriginal entity.On a still further level of generalisation, you can createServitors who have no specific function or provenance, saving"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"14that they serve to increase the success of oneís own magics.Such servitors can be used in both major and minor acts ofmagic, and are particularly useful in acts of enchantment,divination, or illumination.Servitor DependencyIt is generally held that each usage of a Servitor serves to ëfeedíit, and that each result which is rated as a success, serves toenhance itís power. It is also a good idea to get into the habit ofattributing any occurrences within the sphere of activity of thatServitor, to itís work. This can lead to problems, though. In1992 I created a Servitor called ìEureka.î Itís given sphere ofactivity was that of Illumination - inspiration, new ideas, theboosting of creativity and brainstorming in general. Initially,the Servitor exceeded all my expectations of itís performance. Iused it to stimulate new ideas for writing, lecturing and facilitatingseminars & workshops. With a colleague, it became a focus forbrainstorming - acting as a Third Mind arising from conversation.Each time we made a creative leap, or an idea formed becamesomething workable in practice, the power of the Servitor wasboosted. In 1993, the activity of Eureka was linked with theNeptune-Uranus conjunction with the result that, on April 22nd,as Neptune & Uranus began to retrograde, Eureka went ìoff-line.îThe immediate result of this was that I suddenly found itmuch harder to get into a flow of creative thinking. It seemedthat Eureka had become such a dominant element in thedynamics of my own creative process that, once it was removed,I found it much harder to get into the appropriate frame ofmind. I had become dependent upon the Servitor. Eventually,the Servitor was recalled and disassembled in such a way that aësplinterí of itís original power survived as a focus forillumination. Having been made wiser by this experience, Ionly occasionally use this fragment of the original servitor as afocus for creativity.Viral ServitorsIt is possible to instruct Servitors to replicate or reproduce"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"15themselves. Approaches to this include instructing the Servitorto replicate itself as a form of cell-division, replication whichfollows cybernetic or viral parameters, or to create a servitorwhich ëgives birthí according to particular parameters, such astime-units, astrological transits, or each time the target of theServitor carries out a particular behaviour. An early test of thisconcept was that of a Servitor despatched to assist in the recoveryof property being withheld from itís owner. Once a set deadlinehad been passed, the Servitor began to generate a field ofëconfusioní - lost keys, electrical blowouts & other minor butannoying problems. After a second set deadline, the Servitorbegan to replicate itself, so that the confusion field generatedwas intensified. As soon as the recipient of the Servitor returnedthe property he had been withholding from itís owner, theServitors ceased to function. Evidence of the Servitorsí action -the intensification of minor problems escalating into strangepoltergeist-type phenomenon, was gathered by talking toassociates of the target.Viral Servitors are particularly appropriate for long-termenchantments, such as increasing the probability of oneís magicbeing successful, or being used in healing & general protectionworkings.SERVITOR DESIGN SEQUENCE1. Define General IntentThe first step in designing a Servitor is to decide the generalsphere of influence into which your intention falls, such ashealing, protection, binding, harmony, luck, divination, moodenhancement, success in ...., and so forth.Defining your general intent will assist you if you wish to usesymbols & magical correspondences in creating your servitor.For example, if you were interested in creating a servitor to actwithin the sphere of Healing, then you could assemble anyassociations, symbols, emotions, memories, etc which you relateto the concept of Healing. By consulting a book of magicalcorrespondences such as ë777í, you could build up chains ofcorrespondences - planetary figures, scents, colours, planetary"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"16hours etc. How far you go in this direction is very much a matterof personal choice.2. Defining Specific IntentHere, you are creating the core of the Servitorís purpose theStatement of Intent which is analogous to the Servitorís aethericDNA. Formulating the Servitorís Statement of Intent maynecessitate a good deal of self-analysis into your motivations,desires, realistic projections of goals, etc. As in all sorceryoperations, it is appropriate to ask advice from your preferredform of divination. To continue the example of a HealingServitor, an appropriate Statement of Intent might be:ìTo promote rapid recovery and health in ...(name)...îOnce you have determined the appropriate Intent to formthe basis of your Servitor, then the Statement can be renderedinto a sigil, or glyph..3. What Symbols Are Appropriate to the Servitorís Task?There is a wealth of magical & mythic symbols which youcan draw upon when creating a servitor, which can be used torepresent different qualities, abilities and attributes. There isalso the symbolism of colour, smell, sound & other sensory mediato draw upon. In order to refine the ëprogramí which forms thebasis for your servitor further, you could embellish the sigil byadding other symbols.4. Is there a Time Factor to Consider?Here, you should consider the duration of the Servitorísoperation. In other words, do you want the Servitor to beëworkingí continuously, or only at specific periods? Here, youmay wish to take into account phases of the moon, astrologicalconjunctions or planetary hours, for example, which could beadded into the Servitorís symbolic instructions. The HealingServitor above for example, was instructed to be active for aperiod of seven days, affecting itís target recipient for sevenminutes, at seven hour intervals. This instruction serves toreinforce the number symbolism & association with harmony.It is also at this point that you should consider what happens"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"17after the Servitor has performed its task. It is generally held tobe preferable that when a Servitor has completed its task, theServitor should be disassembled by its creator. There are twoapproaches to doing this. Firstly, one can encode a ìself-destructîinstruction into the Servitor at the time of itís creation, wherethe duration of its existence is defined in terms of the durationof its task, or the fulfilment of a specific condition.The other approach to disassembly is to perform a ritualëreabsorptioní of the Servitor, mentally drawing it back from itístask, taking it apart by visualization, taking back the originaldesire which sparked itís creation, and taking apart or destroyingany material base which you have created for it. Whilst classicaloccult theory has it that if you do not look after your thought-forms, they will wander around the astral plane annoying people,there is good psychological sense for terminating the ëlifeí ofServitors which have completed their assigned task - that youare reclaiming responsibility for that desire-complex which youused to create the Servitor.5. Is A Name Required?The Servitor can be given a name which can be used, inaddition to its sigil, for creating, powering, or controlling it. Aname also acts to further create a Servitorís persona. A namecan reflect the Servitorís task, or be formed from a mantric sigilof itís Statement of Intent.6. Is a Material Base Required?The Material base is some physical focus for the Servitorísexistence. This can help to define the Servitor as an individualentity, and can be used if you need to recall the Servitor for anyreason. Examples of a material base include bottles, rings,crystals, small figurines as used in fantasy role-playing or figurescrafted from modelling compounds. Bodily fluids can be appliedto the material base to increase the perceived link betweencreator and entity. This is very much a matter of personal taste.Alternatively, the Servitor can remain freely mobile as an aethericentity. I tend to find that one-shot, task-specific servitors can beleft as aetheric entities, whilst for entities which have more of"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"18along-term use, a material base is often helpful. For others, itmight be possible to link their use to a specific, identifiable,state of consciousness, which forms part of the core associationswhich one builds up for a Servitor.It is also possible to link a Servitor to a specific smell, such asa perfume or essential oil, so that each time the oil is applied,the Servitor is activated. This can be particularly useful whencreating Servitors for general Healing, Protection, orenhancement of a particular mood. A dab of the perfume canbe put onto the Servitorís material base, and the perfume shouldbe inhaled during the launch of the entity.7. Is a Specific Shape Required?Servitors can be created to have any desired shape, from tinyhomunculi to morphic spheres capable of extruding any requiredappendage. The shape you choose to identify with this particularthought-form can add another level of representational identityto the entity. A common practice though, is to visualize theServitor as a featureless sphere, pulsing with energy, glowingwith appropriately chosen colours, into which has beenimpressed, itís sigilised instructions."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"19GoHu ServitorThis short essay is an account of one of my most successfulservitors to date.The twin spirits of gossip and rumour have followed me aboutever since I started ëdoing thingsí on the UK magical scene.Rumours ranging from allegations of affiliation to ëdarkí satanicgroups to upheavals in my sex-life have whirled around and insome instances, ended up in the pages of pagan ëzines. Back inthe late 80ís, Pagan At The Heart magazine announced to theirreaders that I had become ëcelibateí, and followed this up withthe announcement that they could name the ëladyí whoovercame my will - unfortunately, they got not only the namebut also the gender of the person concerned wrong, but I supposeitís the thought that counts!At times I have become both paranoid and pissed off by therumours I heard circulating about myself. During a particularlybad phase of feeling like this, I started working on a GossipHunter-Seeker-Killer servitor, whose task would be to hoveraround on the astral, detecting gossip and firing off a missilecontaining some suitably horrible runic curse. I actually got asfar as ëtestingí this entity - firing off a ëblankí missile at anunsuspecting colleague - just to see if it worked the way I wantedit to - before realising that I was going a teensy wee bit over thetop about the whole thing.Instead of thinking, ìGet the Bastardsî I began to look at thewhole issue of gossip & rumour in a new light. After all, ifpeople are talking about you ëbehind your backí, they could besaid to be feeding you energy. As Terry Pratchett & Neil Gaimanwisely note in Good Omens: ìNotoriety wasnít as good as fame,but was heaps better than obscurity.î Bearing this in mind, I"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"20decided to create a servitor that actively worked to generategossip and rumour, rather than counter it. After all, whatís worse,being talked about - or not being talked about? Those magicianswho leap to the defensive of their parent organisation everytime someone drops a snide remark about them being paranoidwould do well to remember this, and count themselves bloodylucky that people bother to think about them at all! I doremember, whilst being a member of a certain large internationalmagical order, some guy approaching me and hesitantly askingìIs it true that to join the *.*.*. you have to be able to visualisean object so that other people can see it too?î Naturally I saidnothing to deny or confirm this. Of course, this is the sort ofrumour one likes to hear about oneís organisation. But if youwant people to think this sort of thing, you also have to beprepared to accept the people who accuse you of being closetChristians or not eating babies or whatever. Itsí a sort of Dayside/Backside Tree of Life metaphor, I guess. Particularly as if youcontinually deny anything thatís even a bit dodgy, people willsuss out that youíre talking through your backside. A few yearsago, at the Oxford Thelemic Symposium, a delegation from the Templeof Set did a presentation on how nice they really all were. Theirspokesperson mentioned some of the rumours circulating -animal sacrifices, rent boys, drugs etc. and dismissed them all,saying that the TOS had been unfairly maligned. Sitting there,I thought, well whatís the point then? Iíd have been moreimpressed if theyíd said - ìYes we do do unspeakable ritualswith sheep and street urchins - and WHY NOT?îAnyhow, I ended up deciding that gossip about me was, byand large, not all that bad. Not only are people feeding meëpowerí, theyíre also doing some P.R. - and (though this isstretching the idea somewhat) - some of the rumours might actlike a kind of enchantment - without me having to do anything.Iíd already heard two rumours about me owning various shopsin Leeds, you see. So GoHuís task was to encourage people totalk about me, and generate rumours - and ensure that I got tohear about it eventually. Now as Iíve said, by the time I gotaround to doing this, there was some level of gossip/rumour"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"21being generated anyway. So all GoHu had to act as a kind ofëamplifierí as well as receiving rumours and beaming them inmy direction.The RumoursSince GoHu became active, the following tales have reachedback to my shell-like ears:1. That I have a castle in the South of France (!)2. That I own the Atlantis Bookshop in London (!)3. That I am, in reality, Peter J. Carroll (!!)4. That I was putting in a bid to buy a Goth nightclub inBirmingham (someone actually rang me up to ask me if thiswas ëtrueí!)5. That I apparently sodomize former Chaos International editorIan Read on a regular basis.(!)6. That I am a blood-drinking ëvampireí - this ëfactí isrecounted in 2 books - Hearts of Darkness by John Parker (a so-called ëinvestigative journalistí who purports to examine modernoccultism - in the wake of the ëSatanic Child Abuseí scare) andThe Worldís Greatest Unsolved Mysteries - I forget the authors offhand,but they are involved with ASSAP and the Society for PsychicalResearch. This one stems from a short story which deals withvampiric themes published in Chaos International, entitled ëDropletsí.As it was written in the first person, apparently some peoplehave chosen to believe it was me baring my soul. Oh dear!"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"22Functional SpiritsOne approach to Evocation is working with Spirits which havea provenance over a particular situation or experience. Entitiessuch as these are detailed in grimoires such as The Lesser Key ofSolomon the King which are handbooks of spirits, giving details ofspiritsí typical forms, names, sigils, and how to conjure them.The spirits in books such as the Lesser Key have bizarre names,even more bizarre appearances, yet their powers are directlyfunctional and useful. For example, RAUM appears as ablackbird, and can create love, reconcile enemies, or destroycities and reputations.The standard approach to summoning these spirits is to usethe time-honoured magical ritual, wherein the entities are calledforth into a triangle, and ceremonially bound to the magicianíswill. However, there is also another possibility, which is simplythat of summoning a Spirit when you find yourself in anappropriate situation. The following example illustrates thisprocess.All of us, at one time or another, suffer from being stuck intraffic, from freeway jams to slow-moving queues of people.Wouldnít it be nice to be able to whistle up the assistance of aspirit which enabled you to start moving? A big hand pleasefolks for the spirit GOFLOWOLFOG, the spirit who eases trafficblockages so that you can continue your journey. Goflowolfogtypically appears in the form of a shades-wearing cat riding askateboard. He brings with him a wind, and a noise which soundslike ìNeeeowww.î He is of a cool, stylish disposition.Gowflowolfog can be summoned when you are in a situationwhich falls under his governance, such as being stuck in a verycrowded train (during a heatwave) which in accordance withthe snafu principle, has stopped and shows no sign of movingagain. In such a situation, listen out for the ìNeeowwwî and"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"23watch out for Goflowolfog as he zips past you on his skateboard,leaving the ghost-sensation of a breeze. If nothing else, this actof summoning may take your mind off sources of stress - suchas the desire to murder the guy with the boom-box standingnext to you as you slowly melt in the heat of the carriage. Asthe spirit slides past you, attract his attention by transformingyourself (if only inwardly) into a dude who is almost as cooland stylish as Goflowolfog himself, and visualise yourself for amoment standing with him on the skateboard as it flashesthrough the blockage. Then let go of the ëvisioní and relax,allowing the spirit to get on with his job.If you should summon Goflowolfog to get the traffic aroundyou moving, and he performs his task (even if you only move afew yards), then you are beholden to offer him something inreturn (itís only good manners). While there are many forms ofappeasement to spirits, the two most pleasing to Gowflowolfogare firstly, to allow someone else space to move. This could takethe form of stepping back to let someone who is in a hurry walkpast you, or allowing another car driver to move into your laneby leaving him a space. Secondly, be kind to the next cat yousee.Where does Goflowolfog come from? He was identified andassembled during a magical seminar in London, on an eveningwhen Britain was experiencing a heat-wave, and everyone whohad attended the seminar had experienced traffic problems ingetting there. The design sequence was as follows:1. General Situation: Traffic2. Function - related to situation: Easing Traffic stoppages3. Naming the Spirit - several suggestions were made for anappropriate name, and GO FLOW was chosen. This name wasmade suitably ëbarbaricí by mirroring it, so becomingGOFLOWOLFOG.4. Shape of the Spirit - a number of possible shapes weresuggested, such as a wheel or set of traffic signals, but the imageof a cat riding a skateboard was both memorable, and similarto the bizarre incongruous shapes accorded to spirits in thegrimoires."},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"245. Disposition or Character of the Spirit: it was decided thatGoflowolfog could be nothing but cool, stylish and relaxed,speedy and graceful. It was felt that he would respond kindly toanyone who attempted to take on these qualities in a situationas frustrating as being stuck in a traffic jam.The sound associated with the movement of the spirit canalso act as a mantra to help call him to you. His sigil, a circlecontaining two opposite-running arrows, can be used as atalisman, placed on cars, cycles or other modes of transport todraw the favour of Goflowolfog or as a focus for evocation.Using this process, you could easily create your own grimoiresof helpful spirits. It can be interesting (and fun!) to do this witha group of friends, so that not only are the spirits ëassembledíby many people, they are also used in different ways. The moresuccessful uses of the spirit that are reported, the moreëconfidenceí in the spirit will be raised. Given time and wideusage, it may even happen that the image of your spirit entersthe general cultural meme-pool. If you ever see a report in theNational Enquirer or Fortean Times about sightings of cats ridingskateboards, remember Goflowolfog!"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"25Some Observations from The Goetia ProjectThe Goetia Project was the title of as long-term projectundertaken by myself and a colleague in 1989. Our originalaim was to work through a series of ëtraditionalí grimoires and,following assessments and analysis of our findings, create ageneral approach to Goetia suitable for our post-modern era.Needless to say, things did not go exactly as we planned.Our first series of workings was drawn from the Lesser Key ofSolomon. Our first evocation, of the spirit Vassago, was performedwithout using the traditional arrangement of circle, triangle,etc. ëJust to see what happened, as it wereí. The result was thatthe working lacked clear definition; visions of the spirit calledforth were hazy at best, and we both experienced a lowering ofvitality (a feeling of being ëdrainedí), headaches and pre-flu-like symptoms for a couple of days following. In view of this,we constructed a permanent circle and triangle, according tothe ërulesí in the lesser Key, and all workings were conducted inthe fashion outlined in the lesser Key.Using the long conjurations and constraints to the spirit givenin the Lesser Key itself is exhilarating. The long sentences,punctuated by the Old Testament names of God and Biblicalquotations, quickly raises excitement to a fever pitch, and oncethe spirit can be discerned, it must then be abjured to remainwithin the Triangle of Art. The shapes which the spirits assumedwere rarely exactly that described within the lesser Key (hereafterLK), but generally similar. We found that once a spirit hadappeared to us in a particular form, then it more or less tookthat shape in subsequent evocations.Once evoked, a spirit would then be questioned bout itsnature, qualities, and how we could improve upon the evocation-environment. In one instance, we questioned the spirit Vassagoabout the optimum time for evoking him. He made reply by"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"26showing us a sundial, hourglass and skull. We further testedhim by requiring him to give me a vision of where my colleaguewould be the following afternoon. I was promptly given a clearvision of walking through long corridors filled with people andlined with lockers, of going up a flight of stairs and walkinginto a room, which was full of boxes - but at this point, thevision became unclear. My colleague later told me that thebuilding I had ëseení was Leeds Polytechnic, and that the roomwith ëboxesí (where the vision had become unclear) was hecomputer department! This led us to feel that computers wereoutside the experience of Vassago, as were digital watches.Whilst working through the series of evocations we alsoattempted various modifications to the conjurations. Invocationof appropriate God-forms, such as Horus, prior to beginningthe evocatory process, seemed to make the conjuration of spiritssuch as Haures or Andromelius easier. During an evocation ofGlasyglabolas, we preceded the conjurations with an invocationof chaos, ëThe Unsealing of the Vorticesí, which was originallydesigned for a series of Eris workings. As we did this, awindstorm blew up about the house we were working in, butthe spirit we were attempting to conjure flickered in and out ofthe triangle. It seemed to us that the ëenergiesí created by theVortices was impeding the spiritís ability to manifest, so we closedthem, the windstorm dropped away, and the spirit came throughinto the triangle.Incidents such as these led us to postulate that the LK spiritstended to a certain degree of conservatism over the parameterswithin which they could he cal led forth. The visions that theyimparted to us concerning the optimum environment forconjuration definitely belonged to the ëbaroqueí school of magic- cellars, clouds of incense, lots of paraphernalia etc."},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"27Evoking Yog-SothothIntroductionOne of the aims of the Esoteric Order of Dagon is to develop effectivemagical techniques with which to interact with the Great OldOnes. As a member of the Pylon of Yog-Sothoth Lodge, Ihave become increasingly interested in the possibility of rituallyevoking this entity as a tangible phenomena. The aim of thisarticle is to expound a possible methodology by which entitiessuch as Yog-Sothoth can be contacted, drawing together researchin different fields of enquiry, and exploring how they relate tothe Cthulhu Mythos.I feel that, rather than exploring Lovecraftian themes usingtraditional magical systems such as the Qabalah (thoughobviously, it may provide a useful parallel), the most obviousplace to look for guidelines is Lovecraftís fiction itself. Fromthis, we find that for example, in The Dunwich Horror, Lovecraftclearly illustrates that ëhilltop ritesí, associated with stone circlesand strange geophysical phenomena, are a key whenapproaching entities such as Yog-Sothoth. Bringing the GreatOld Ones into our dimension requires some form of ëgateí,which in mythos tales, is often a wild outdoor site, a stonecircle, tower, or a similar type of power spot. Lovecraft is alsocareful to point out that such sites have, in historical terms, along history of strange manifestations associated with them.Again and again, he places great emphasis on the folklore ofthose who live on the borders of such areas; that ëlocalsí havetraditions that the educated sceptics appearing in the tales scoffat.The theme of specific regions which have a long history ofstrange manifestations is well-documented. John Keel, in StrangeCreatures From Time & Space, explores several cases involving themanifestation of strange beings that appear to be localised to a"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"28particular region. One example of this is the ëMoth-manísightings in West Virginia, which occurred between 1966-1968.Another area, perhaps of more interest to UK EOD initiates isIlkley Moor, which has a long, and well-documented history ofstrange phenomena encountered, from ghosts and black dogsto UFOs and what modern researchers in the field of EarthMysteries call Earth Lights.The Earth Lights phenomena has arisen largely from the workof Paul Deveraux, editor of The Ley Hunter and co-founder ofThe Dragon Project. His theories are drawn from the fact that theEarth produces a range of light-forms by natural processes.These ëunexplainedí light-forms have been interpreted by thosewho encounter them as UFOs or spectral manifestations. Theoccurrence of these phenomena is commonly found to bespecific to a particular region. The lights often ëfollowí cars, orare reported by observers to behave ëas though they were beingguidedí or were intelligent. Deveraux notes that outbreaks ofEL phenomena are sometimes associated with columns ofgaseous material, which can be interpreted by observers asëwhite ladyí type ghosts. Researchers in the field of EarthMysteries hypothesise that the source of such light-forms is thetectonic activity of the Earth, where stress along fault linescombines with other factors to emit light phenomena in thearea around the fault line. Deveraux notes that medieval tinand copper miners actually looked for the appearance of ëlightsfrom the groundí when searching out new mine sites. A UFOëflapí around Ilkley Moor in 1984 appears to validate this theory,as it followed an exceptional earthquake in that area, whichmeasured at 5.5 on the Richter Scale. Some accounts ofobservers of light forms (commonly perceived as UFOs)suggested that the manifestations followed the patterns of thefault lines that run under the region. Deverauxís book, EarthLights Revelation, explores this kind of activity all over the world,and notes the strong connection between UFO sightings andgeological faulting. While many Ufologists reject the EarthLights theory which in part explains UFO encounters as a purelyterrestrial phenomena, Earth Mysteries research is continuing"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"29to document evidence to support and further edify Deverauxísideas.Reading accounts of Earth Light sightings and theirrelationship to specific regions and underground activity is forme, very reminiscent of Lovecraftís accounts of the activitiesassociated with the Great Old Ones. What is perhaps alsosignificant for the modern magician is that very often, stonecircles and other sacred sites are situated in regions wheregeological faulting takes place. Deveraux proposes that the sitesperhaps served to amplify and focus the natural occurrence oflight phenomena. There is a wealth of folklore worldwide whichcould be related to the appearance of Earth Lights, from Willëoí the Wisps to Faeries, Ghosts, and more recently, UFOs.From Butterflies to BeezlebubI am greatly indebted to the recent explorations by Fra.Choronzon of the Illuminates of Thanateros for his lucidexposition of Chaos Mathematics, especially in its relation tomagical entities. In an essay entitled ëChaos Invocationí, Fra.Choronzon writes that:ëWe are all aware that information can be transferred from one place toanother by modulation of electro-magnetic standing waves. I wouldlike you to consider the possibility that information might also becapable of storage or transfer within a toroidal (i.e. doughnut-shaped)structure having an electromagnetic character.íChoronzon goes on to suggest that such ordered structuresarise quite naturally out of the Chaos Mathematics whichgoverns the behaviour of gases and liquids. Probably the best-known example of this is the great Red Spot which appears inJupiterís atmosphere. He gives the example of a blown smoke-ring being such a structure, and goes onto point out that it isconceivable that a non-smoker could equally well project aring of gas from their lips, which could be established in theatmosphere, though its presence, by normal standards, wouldbe impossible to detect. Choronzon proposes that it ismathematically possible for such structures, which have (at least"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"30in part) an electromagnetic character to exist within the Earthísmagnetic field. He also proposes that it is possible to producesuch structures by expending energy in the form of neuro-chemical activity in the nervous system. In short, physiologicalgnoses of the sort used by magicians in ritual can produce suchtoroid structures.The above has interesting implications for both magiciansand researchers into Earth Mysteries. Over the past year, I havebeen conducting a great deal of research into the creation,usage, and aetiology of evoked entities, including both thedemonic forms of the Goetia and the ëElemental Servitorsícreated by magicians to perform a specific task. In the lattercase, the process is very much one of creating an ëinformationmatrixí; that is, of laying down a set of instructions which definethe nature, abilities, and functions of the entity. Into thisinformation matrix is projected energy, which forms the entityas a whole, which is then able to act, independently of itscreator. A purely psychological or subjective account of thisprocess cannot account for the ability of such an entity tomanifest results (in accordance with the creatorís intent) in thephysical world.Following Choronzonís ideas on Chaos Dynamics, it seemslikely to me that in evoking, and thereby creating, an elementalservitor, one could be bringing into existence a structure such asis outlined above. If we can accept (at least in theory) that thesestructures are capable of retaining information over time, thenwe could be looking at a partial model for a wide range ofphenomena associated with discrete ëspiritsí. In my experience(and that of colleagues), the more ëworkí that is given to anelemental servitor, the more ëpowerfulí it becomes - in terms ofits ability to manipulate probabilities, and eventually take onan independent character of its own. It is not unknown forpowerful entities to survive the death of their creator. The morepeople that ëcreateí such an entity also enhances its survivaland capacity to store information. In these terms, it is easy tosee how a small spirit may, given time and the energy input(directed through ritual and other techniques for directingenergy) by enough people, could become what we commonly"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"31assume to be ëgodsí.To side-step for a moment, I wish to look again at some ofthe phenomena associated with UFO and spectral encounters.One factor that rises time and again to haunt the scepticalresearcher is the commonality of experiences between differentindividuals who come into contact with these anomalies.Historical research into UFO ëflapsí shows that there have beenspates of sightings of mysterious spirits, dirigibles, aircraft,submarines, and of course, flying saucers, throughout history.Also, numerous reports from individuals who have beenëcontactedí by extra- terrestrial entities show similar structuralfeatures in the accounts which have been ërememberedí (oftenby hypnosis being used as a recall technique). In dealing withsuch phenomena, there is obviously a great many factors whichneed to be taken into consideration, but I would like to discusssome of the possible processes which are occurring, with theaim of weaving them into the discussion later. Perhaps I should begin by making a declaration; that I donot believe that consciousness is a purely internal or subjectiveexperience; rather, it is an emergent property of our interactionwith the biosphere as a whole. I would assert that consciousness,and the self-referential awareness of human beings, are notnecessarily one and the same. When individuals encountersomething ëoutsideí their embedded structure of ëhow the worldshould beí - that is, consensus reality, it seems to me that thereis a factor which can be termed ëthe credibility envelopeí whichcomes into play, whereby an individual ëfitsí the experienceinto a category that least strains the limitations of consensusreality. Thus a strange encounter may become a meeting with areligious entity, a ghost, or creatures from outer space. Consciousëbelief í in the validity of such entities is not necessarily a factor,since all these phenomena are part of the folklore of ëtheunknowní and can be present as ëmemesí (units of information)in the subconscious mind of the individual, thanks to ourinformation-rich culture, with its vast networks of media forthe transmission of information. Investigation into suchexperiences suggests that people, given some form of unusualstimulus, such a strange light, will elaborate all kinds of"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"32information. Recall techniques such as hypnosis are fallible inthat the psychological tendency to confabulate information (anunconscious defence mechanism) tends to yield up a great dealof information which investigators are expecting to hear, whichcan again be drawn from information stored in the unconsciousabout what is commonly associated with this type of experience.Another example of this process is the reports of so-calledsurvivors of ësatanic child abuseí which is rich in detail aboutbizarre practices but very hazy when it comes to names, dates,places and so forth. The common themes which arise in suchencounters could well be a product of cultural similaritiesbetween individuals, or even commonalities formed from theway the human brain structures perception.Paul Deveraux tentatively asserts the proposition that the EarthLight phenomena is consciousness-sensitive. That is, that theenergy forms are sensitive to the conscious mind of the observer.Many accounts of Earth Lights talk about the lights followingthe observer, playing ëtagí with them, or appear to display thecharacteristics of being intelligently guided. This brings us backto magical phenomena and Fra. Choronzonís ëChaos Invocationítheories. When creating (or evoking a spirit from a grimoire),we are focusing energy and building an information matrixwhich, in turn, allows the energy to create a discrete entitywhich behaves within the limits of the information given -either the information which defines the characteristics of theentity, or the information given in the grimoire. This process issimilar (though far more intentional and directed) to theinteraction between a strange phenomena - an Earth Light forexample, - and the individual who encounters it. ëTraditionalítheories concerning the interaction between human beings andspirits time and time again recount the idea that spirits ëlikeíinteracting with humans because we confer on them a propertyof ëindividualityí that they do not inherently possess. I feel thatthere is a grain of truth in this view; that our capacity to organiseand structure information into discrete wholes is a key featurein coming to grips with this kind of experience. All magicalpsychocosms, such as Qabalah, Abra-Melin, etc., give a series"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"33of instructions as to how entities summoned using thosestructures behave.Bearing in mind Fra. Choronzonís ideas concerning thetoroidal structures which are at least partially electro-magneticin character, I would say that it is not beyond the bounds ofpossibility for such a phenomena to be related to occurrencessuch as Earth Light encounters. If such an energy form respondsto (or stimulates) the human capacity to create an informationmatrix, or indeed if our interaction with the energy formproduces as an emergent property a gestalt in accordance witheither a deliberately projected or an unconsciously formed ideaof what the phenomena is, then we are close to arriving at aworking methodology for accounting for a wide range ofoccurrences. Drawing on Fra. Choronzonís work further, if wecan accept that the energy form, once given a structural definitionby an initial encounter with an individual or group ofindividuals, can retain that definition over time, then it becomespossible to see how people can, during an encounter ëflapí in agiven region, report seeing similar manifestations. In short, theenergy form, once given a structure, can retain this information,and feed them back to other individuals who subsequentlyinteract with them.The Neuromancer EffectA parallel phenomena which fits this hypothesis is that ofChannelling. In an essay entitled Morons From Inner Space?: ACritical Look at Channelled Communications I set out a model of oneof the processes possibly involved in the channelling experience:ìAn interesting model for examining inner-plane contactscan be found within William Gibsonís novel, Neuromancer.One of the major characters is an Artificial Intelligencewhich manipulates a cast of humans to further its own ends.To successfully do this it must establish a rapport with thoseit wishes to manipulate. It does this by generating constructs- personalities which it wears like masks, creating them outof the memories of the humans it wishes to contact. It"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"34explains that it needs these masks to establish a point ofaccess - an interface - between its own experience and theperceptual limits of human beings. Reading this broughtvery much to mind accounts of human- entity contacts.Particularly a sentence in Dion Fortuneís The Cosmic Doctrine,which reads:ìWhat we are you cannot realise and it is a waste of time to try anddo so but you can imagine (italics mine) us on the astral plane and wecan contact you through your imagination, and though your mentalpicture is not real or actual, the results of it are real and actual.îDion Fortune made extensive use of inner-plane contactsto synthesise her magical ideas. Alan Richardson, in hisbiography of Dion Fortune, Priestess, discusses the varioushistorical figures that Fortune claimed to be in contact with.The most interesting entity is one ìDavid Carsonsî, whomaccording to Fortune, was a young British officer who waskilled during the first World War. Fortune provided a gooddeal of biographical information concerning Carsons, andafter thorough research, Alan Richardson states that Carsonsdid not exist! Rather, it seems, he was actually, in terms ofthe above model, a construct; a personality generated outof Dion Fortuneís experimental magic and experiences,and hence an interface for accessing information. If youimagine the sum total of your personal memories andknowledge as a sphere in space - the unknown - then toextend your sphere of information it is as though a windowmust be created, through which the unknown, or raw data,can be translated into information that is meaningful interms of perceptual limitations. Inner-plane entities arehow we tend to conceptualise these windows into chaos.They appear as independent entities so that we can makesense of the incoming data. Their personalities are usuallyconcurrent with the recipientís belief system. Hence themany forms of the entities, depending on where you believethe seat of wisdom is, be it Egypt, Sirius B, or some draughtymonastery in Tibet. Usually, it seems, these entities are"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"35automatically generated as one focuses will and imaginationtowards any one vector, but occasionally entities can begenerated as an act of will, so that ìoutpostsî can beestablished within which personal ideas and inner-worldscan be explored and eventually integrated into oneíspsychocosm. At this point the whole issue of the ìrealityîof the experience breaks down, as these entities are notsimply ìsecondary personalitiesî in the pathological sense,but constructs which are emergent properties of ourinformation-processing capacity interacting with that whichlies beyond it.îIt strikes me that the above model is also valid for a wide rangeof magical phenomena connected with spirit contacts - that thehuman tendency to relate to all things as though they are discretephenomena ( surely a property of how our brains organiseinformation ) enables us to generate ëmasksí or personae uponthe energy forms we are encountering. Channelledcommunications from entities are often a by-product of UFOexperiences as well as psychic encounters. It may well be thatour interaction with energy forms gives rise to such constructs -that masks are created and retained by the energy structures,not from any kind of self-referential intelligence on the part ofthe Earth Lights, but from the principle (from Systems Theory)that some energy forms are attracted towards structures of highercohesiveness, such as the information field generated by thehuman brain, or possibly the electro-magnetic field generatedby cars, power lines, etc.All of which leads us slowly back to Stone Circles; Lovecraftísëfrienzied rites on the hilltopsí, and the role that sound plays inall of this. There is a great deal of magical literature availableexploring the dynamics of sound, particularly different vocaltechniques used to produce an Altered State ofConsciousness(ASC). One of the key factors seems to be rhythm.rhythms carry our consciousness along, from heartbeats, to cyclesof breathing, sleeping, night-day and the passage of seasons.rhythms promote associated body movements and adjustments,and act as a signal to begin movement without conscious effort,"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"36so that less energy is expended when you begin; for example, ithas been shown that soldiers can march further, and in betterform, with less fatigue, when accompanied by a marching band.The feeling of being ìcarriedî comes from the structure thatrhythm gives to our time-sense, and the pattern gives a senseof continuance. It becomes a motor attitude, and oneís attentionis freed (if this is desired). rhythms also become ìmirroredî byour brain activity, and they have powerful physiological effectson us. Music Therapists have found that people suffering fromAphasia or Huntingdonís Chorea (both neurological disorderswhich impair speech) can carry a tune, and group singing is acommon element in therapeutic voice training. Anthropologistshave done a great deal of work examining the role that musicplays in hallucinogenic journeys. The presence of music as aritual accessory to hallucinogenic drug use can be observed ona wide cross-cultural base. Marlene Dobkin De Rios, in herbook Hallucinogens: A Cross-Cultural Perspective, suggests that theritualised use of music within hallucinogenic journeys helpsthe shaman ëleadingí such an experience to provide a structurewith which to point participants towards significant experienceswithin the trip. This is also seen in Voudoun, where specificdrumming rituals announce the manifestation of particular Lao.What is obvious from this is that sound imposes a structure ontoexperience, in particular, with regard to Time-sense. Of which,more later.Returning to Fra. Chorozonís work on Chaos Invocation, henotes the use of a ëpulse of soundí injected into the spaceoccupied by one of the toroidal structures he describes by whichthe information matrix is transferred to the structure. Theforceful enunciation of sound, whether it be Enochian Calls,Primal Speech, or Barbarous Words of Evocation of necessityproduces an ASC, as techniques such as these lead tohyperventilation, increased brain activity, tachycardia, etc. It iswell-accepted by magicians and mystics that ësound carriesthoughtí and that for advanced practitioners, vocalisation is nota necessity for the ritual (or whatever) to be efficacious. What isimportant, is the focusing of awareness along a particular vector,and the entry into an ASC where the practitioner can focus"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"37attention intensely towards a single point and project it forth.The relationship between sound and sacred sites is also beingresearched, again by Paul Deveraux. The ëhill noisesí of TheDunwich Horror have been reported occasionally as emanatingfrom the locality of sacred sites, differing in variety betweenhigh- pitched buzzing, humming noises, and ëthunderclapsíbeneath the Earth. In Places of Power, Deveraux notes thesuggestion that ultrasound is possibly emitted at some megalithsites, although more work needs to be done to corroborate thiselusive finding. Of more interest is what Deveraux calls ëThePhysics of Shamanismí. Here, he expounds the relationshipbetween psychic (or psi) experiences and the electro-magneticand radiation anomalies associated with sacred sites. Deverauxstates that for him, one of the characteristics of of a psychicexperience related to radiation anomalies is that of the senseof time-slip, where an individual is dislocated in space-timeand experiences a vision of past (or future) time. Now alteredtime perceptions are a common feature of magical ritual,hallucinogenic use, UFO encounters and spectral manifestations.This leads me to suggest that Time is not merely as we usuallyperceive it - a separate force acting upon us, but itself is aproduct of consciousness. In states of gnosis, however they arebrought on, experiencing the sense that time has stopped, orthat future, past, and present can be apprehendedsimultaneously, is fairly common. It is also a common featureof Type 4 Close Encounters, where people claim to have beentaken on board alien spacecraft and subjected to tests (or otherindignities), and also of possession states from which anindividual may emerge with only a fragmentary memory ofwhat took place. From a magical point of view, this ëpeakí in anASC is the most fortuitous moment at which to project energyforth to realise oneís will. Following the theory of Earth Lights,together with Fra. Choronzonís toroidal structures that assumetheir own information structure, it may well be that suchphenomena bring about ëtimeslipí experiences and, as to thesource of the images that come in, well we could speculate farand wide. That we may be much more sensitive to a wider"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"38range of fluctuations in the Earthís magnetic field is becomingmore and more acceptable to science. The American researcher,Michael Persinger, has put forwards the view that there is a linkbetween some forms of psi activity and fluctuations in the Earthísmagnetic field. It has been also suggested that part of theHippocampus region of the brain senses, and distributes to otherbrain areas, information about electromagnetic fields. Persingeríswork appears to validate two points; firstly, that the brain cangenerate electro-magnetic energy, and secondly, that externalsources of electro-magnetic energy can affect brain function,giving rise to a wide variety of ëexperiencedí phenomena. If wecan accept this (and there is a growing body of research thatbears this out), then suddenly Fra. Choronzonís ideas aboutelectro-magnetic structures which have the capacity to orderthemselves by, and retain information over time, donít soundso far-fetched, do they?Coming back to the Cthulhu Mythos, it seems then thatLovecraft was on the right track with his themes of weird hill-regions, stone circles, barbarous words of power, and ëfrienziedritesí. The work of Paul Deveraux and other researchers pointsto the conclusion that some sacred sites at least, are powerspots which predisposed the users towards obtaining an ASCwhereby they could interact with energy forms of an electro-magnetic nature, doubtless aided by Earth Light manifestationsand hallucinogenic substances. Earth Mysteries researcher PaulBennett has noted that in Britain, as in many other places, avariety of plants which have hallucinogenic properties can befound growing near to sacred sites. The magical dynamics ofsound are also a factor, in terms of both the psycho-physicaleffects upon the participants, and the effect upon external energysources.As to the entity Yog-Sothoth, whoís appearance in the Mythostriggered this lengthy chain of synthesis; some modernmagicians, notably those drawing heavily upon the ideas ofKenneth Grant, have drawn a parallel between Yog-Sothothand the demon Choronzon, evoked by Aleister Crowley andVictor Neuburg in the Gobi Desert. Again, The DunwichHorror provides us with a key passage:"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"39ìThe Old Ones were, the Old Ones are, and the Old Ones shall be,not in the spaces we know, but between them. They walk serene andprimal, undimensioned, and to us unseen. Yog Sothoth knows the gate.Yog-Sothoth is the gate. Yog-Sothoth is the key and guardian of the gate.Past, present, future, all are one in Yog-Sothoth. He knows where theOld Ones broke through of old, and where they shall break throughagain. ...They walk unseen and foul in lonely places where the Wordshave been spoken and the Rites howled through at their Seasons. Thewind gibbers with their voices and the earth mutters with theirconsciousness.îThis passage brings to mind the ëtimeslipí phenomenadiscussed above. What is equally, if not more interesting in thelight (no pun intended) of the present discussion is that in otherMythos tales, Yog-Sothoth is described as a conglomerate ofiridescent globes - in other words, a light form phenomena!The entity is also associated with strange atmospheric effectssuch as freak winds and storms (Lovecraft is known to havecarefully related some of his fictional events with floods,earthquakes, and other such occurrence)s. To me, this stressesfurther the validity of Lovecraftís dream-inspired fiction as avalid source of magical ideas.The guidelines to evoking Yog-Sothoth appear, at least as faras The Dunwich Horror sets them forth, to be quite clear andoperationally valid. Investigation of the entity has (in my view)suffered from the negative connotations of association withChoronzon as an entity of dispersal, or ënegativeí chaos. Theemerging science of Chaos Dynamics can perhaps afford us amore positive viewpoint, and the link between Mythos entitiesand the Mandelbrot Set has already been noted by EODinitiates. From the foregoing, I would suggest that Yog-Sothothis quite possible a kind of ëguideí entity that appears in manycultures as the ëguardianí of the underworld entered throughASCs, though one which is capable of manifesting as a series,perhaps, of electro- magnetic phenomena. The entity whichcoheres in the form we understand as Yog-Sothoth is a ëwindowíinto the darkness of the unknown, and perhaps by creating"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"40interfaces, or personae through which we may gleaninformation, we can attain further insights into the way weinteract with our universe. Having theorised thus far, what onlyremains is to go forth and evoke!Postscript: ìFrom the ancient hills I comeîThis essay is largely the result of reading other peopleís researchand shaping it together with my own ideas. One event last yearhowever, served to elevate the field of Earth Mysteries from aminor interest to a subject that I am increasingly drawn to.On the night in question, I was with my boyfriend (also amagician), and he returned from the toilet and informed methat there was an ëentityí lurking in the stairwell that leads tomy flat. This was unusual, but not sufficiently unusual to causeundue concern and so picking up my thunderbolt, I went outto see what was what. In the stairwell, we both agreed on seeinga black, amorphous shape. Since my friend had first noticedthis, I asked him if he would be prepared to try and ëopen hismindí to it, so that I could question it, using him as an interface,which was one of his particular talents, and also a fairly acceptedprocedure for questioning strange entities. The entity declaredìI have come from the ancient hillsî. It also stated that it hadbeen ëawakenedí only recently, due to activity around a sacredsite. It said that it had come to give me ëpowerí with which Icould do something, but was reticent about the exact nature ofthis. When I asked what it would if I rejected this, it said that itwould ìreturn, screaming, to the hillsî. When I asked it toidentify itself, it gave the name of ëAzathothí - which could wellhave sprung from the mind of my friend, though he had noparticular knowledge of the Cthulhu Mythos entities. At thetime, I found it difficult to credit that such a powerful entitywould be hanging politely about in the stairwell, waiting to benoticed. Being unable to obtain a direct answer to myquestioning, I told it to go forth, which it apparently did. I laterhad to perform an intensive banishing ritual upon my friend,who was suffering from symptoms such as feeling cold, a tightpressure on the chest, and personality displacement, and motor"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"41spasms. Symptoms such as these have been described byMichael Persinger as possible side-effects of encounters withEarth Light phenomena.Unbeknown to me at the time, (which was later discoveredwhen I related this tale) two friends of mine who were membersof the West Yorkshire Earth Mysteries Group had experienceda strange encounter at the then newly-uncovered BackstoneStone Circle. Their experience included seeing Earth Lights,small dwarf-like shades, and lines of energy around the stonecircle that they spent a night sitting in. It seems strange, onreflection, that the appearance of the entity claiming to originatefrom a newly-disturbed site seems to relate to their experience.What this experience did do, was to lead me to making a moreintensive study of Earth Mysteries and Magic.ReferencesPaul Deveraux - Earth Lights Revelation, Places of PowerFra.
