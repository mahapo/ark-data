Thisapproach is even subject to it’s own nature. According toLiber CHRNZN, to achieve the ecstasy of heaven one shouldviolate the violate. One of the advantages of the chaosmagical standpoint lies in it’s paradigm shifting. Pleasenote now that this perspective is a paradigm in and ofitself (other perspectives are possible of course). Thecurrent view expressed is to be viewed as the commonlyaccepted filter for interpretation. How this shifting isviewed is up to the personal magicians tastes, but I havefound that ‘Chaos Magick’ concerns itself with somethingwhich underlies all of the filters of existence. In chaos,all is possible, including nothing. Apparent duality’s canbe split-up and torn apart, fractalized meshed and fusedtogether in myriad ways. Much in the same way matter/ anti-matter reactions give rise to huge amounts of liberatedenergy, this way can liberate enormous amounts of belief.Duality can be expressed as the equation 0=2 or the nominal“truth” of duality manifesting from Nothing.

There is anunderlying factor in all of THIS (Reality), which is thetruth which underlies these tools (beliefs) which we use.This is not true in an absolute sense, but true inprobabilities (note any possible contradictions). There area few Laws of Chaos which I want you to keep at the forefront of your consciousness throughout the remainder of thisessay:Elijah’s Law - You shall know truth by it’s paradox.Godel’s Law - There are no absolutes (this law is false)Grendel’s Law - There is no limit to desire other than desires needs.I hope the meaning of this introduction will becomemore clear as I approach the concept known as knowledge andconversation of the holy guardian angel, from the ‘chaoticperspective’ outlined above all in the light (and dark) oftruth."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"1 Theory“In a way it’s all, a matter of time, I will not worry for you, you’llbe just fine, take my thoughts with you and when you look behind, youwill surely see a face that you recognize.

Before doing so I wouldlike to recant a brief history of the origins of the HGA asI have come to know them. [*1 For a more detailed accountand the historical manuscripts please refer to: The SacredMagic of Abramelin the Mage, translated by S.L. MacgregorMathers; Dover books]A long time ago in a land far-far away there was a magewho sought out God and more specifically God’s way (magick)in the world. He searched the world and found tricksters andblack magicians, but none of these satisfied his quest formeaning and truth [No duhh]. One day in his later years heran across a mage living in isolation named Abramelin. Thisguy seemed to be in contact with some real truth here andinitiated our wandering seeker with secrets of the quabalah,and a type of “sacred magic” for achieving contact with theAngel (in relation to the most high). The full details ofthis sojourn are detailed in the first chapter the sacredmagick (*1)."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"Chapter 2 gives the mind set to adopt and prayer-formrituals (which obviously must be personalized to themagician using them). The Third chapter gives other magic’sto poke around with (such as summoning an army to do yourbidding...?) Anyway, it is a good book and I suggest you readit, along with this text. In the latter part of this essay Ipresent Grendel’s Had an Accident and the Rite of Godhood aswell as the collective bindings/ initiations called the Riteof Suffering as my own version of this Operation (inextension).A little Theory Based upon my Song of Illusion.• The HGA is a manifestation from probable time, of theSelf (distinguished from the self) in unity andperfection of it’s will.• The HGA is a reflection of perfection of the Magus. Unityis desired to align more fully with the Will. [I shallnot touch upon the “black” or “white” brotherhood, andshall talk more fully of something called the Scarletbrotherhood]. There is another aspect of the Angel whichis a reflection across the tree of life into the tree ofDeath, this is a ‘natural’ course, as every actionincludes it’s inverse."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":" • The HGA is also an independent being.• As the HGA is partly an astral construct of which energy(prayer-form) is devoted to allow for manifestation.• The Angel has access to knowledge (both mundane andmagical) that is currently beyond the magicians scope andcan reveal all manner of things.• There is a Self which underlies self and transcends thetemporary ego manifestation of the magician. This ego isa mask of the Self(aka Kia, shhh). The ego is of theSelf and by the Self. Identification is both the key andthe cage here. • Thee Angel is the thin silver cord of the Horizon;demarcation ZOS-KIA. The Angels unity with CHRNZN isexplosion of duality to a continuous transformation. Seealso Appendix VI.• Subscribing to all of the above can be of great benefitto the magician because it offers him/ her a handle inthe formulation/ invocation of the Angel, as well as amagnificent channel with which to learn, grow and explorethe infinite worlds and beyond. When faced with nothing,One had better well do something!"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"A side note on dangers. Any invocations and interactionwith the outer-spaces should not be under taken at leastuntil after initial contact with the angel is established.And definitely not in the demonic bindings phase. Why isthis the case? It seems that the pathways extending throughnon-existence, also called the Tunnels of Set are filledwith all manner of energies that can drive an organismcompletely insane at best. Thee Angel acts as a buffer zonefor these experiences &/or guides the magus in explorations.To those who find our lady’s order in Scarlet; Blessedare thou among chaotes."},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"2 The Formulation of the R.O.G.“The magician is the ultimate charlatan. For in his games, he fools thevery universe.” - Frater Halucifuge ’99Let me start with how this all came about... It was sometime ago that I was involved in a relationship. I will notbother you with the details but it is necessary to explainthat I had a great deal of emotional attachment. Anyway,something happened in that relationship at the time whichwas so completely out of the blue, and un-expected, that itshook me to the core of my being {an event which is not outof the range of human potential but was emotionallycatastrophic due to a lifetime of programming}. Basicallyshredding my Heart and needless to say my world wasshattered.{Flash to a sequence with Elijah Forlorn on theDance Floor, and the synchronous words ringing out, “I feellike I’m going crazy... I feel like I’m going insane....” (*a)}Being the opportunist magician that I am, I decided to trysome experiments over the next few days using the great dealof emotional turmoil that I was in.

I also found that bydredging up the memory of that night, this brought renewedturmoil, which allowed me to nullify it yet again. I wasintoxicated for weeks. [This memory was eventuallyexhausted, by this technique]Coincidentally at this time also, I was to undergoinitiation into the Autonomatrix, and had to write aninitiation ritual. I channeled all of the energy I had intothis rite, called the Rite of GODHOOD (ROG). Ever sinceGrendel’s had an Accident I noticed a presence about me,something there but not quite there. It did not feelmenacing, on the contrary, it felt very home-type feeling,so I just kept a doing what I was doing.

Upon arriving at the site, I realizedthat I forgot (I think purposefully) my sigils and guidelines for the rite. I performed therite from memory and constructed the rest. Some very interesting things occur-ed.The first was, in arriving at the ritual, I felt sort of hurt/ angry because thedrummers did not want to partake of any intoxicants with me. I did not know them verywell and they did not trust me. I do not blame them as I probably would do the same, butthis bothered me. This \"bother\" seemed to manifest more and more (after the rite) and itseems that similar factors have been brought to the fore. As if the rite induced and calledfor an analysis/ correction of my personality (in this arena). This is where I am at now,confronting different \"issues\". Another interesting thing occurred, during the rite, uponcalling Set, I felt a presence, a very cynical presence. It felt like, \"Oh look, another godaspirant.\" A sigil manifested during the rite. A sigil whose attribution is the phoenix. Ido not know what this sigil means yet:(SIGIL OMITTED call [1]) whose number is 76, it sort of looks like a 7 & 6combined. Upon being in an 'in-between' sleep/ awake state on Samhain night, a voicecame to me. It sounded like a multitude of robot-like voices in unison. It said somethingto the effect of, \"You were given the first of three. You must plan. You must do thisagain.\" I find this all highly unusual (yeah, as if yelling at the moon is normal?). It alsoseemed as if before I heard the voice, when I closed my eyes, a picture, a formulation ofsome sort was 'mutating'. I also noticed I placed a strong emphasis on the Setian part ofthe rite, and the calling of the southern watchtower was very strong. Ketamine was usedas an intoxicant during the rite, and some pot later that night in celebration at a localrave.

I went out later that night...Today is 11/5/98Some observations of [1] whose number is 76 and is related to the phoenix.According to Grant. K. Nightside of Eden p.62(abbreviated KG:NOE:p.#):\"The final head is named the 'messenger of the fatal wind' and it is identified withthe breath of fire, with Serk, Scorpio, Sirocco, and Typhon, the Typhoon. In the Egyptianlist this head is described as 'hissing to come forth and turn back; seeing by night andbringing by day', a perfect description of Bennu or Phoenix type of returner.\"KG:NOE:p70-71\"She is the whore BABALON, the Scarlet woman of the Cult of theBeast. In Egyptian her name means the number seven (sefekh), she was the primordialgoddess of the seven stars... 393 is the number of a highly secret Ophidian formulaconcealed in the name of an extra-terrestrial entity known as Aossic... the integers 393(3+9+3=15=1+5=6), the number of the sun or solar phallic energy.\"So we see a unity between these concepts. A phoenix-type returner, aconflagration, BABLON and a celestial relation, with some correlation with Aossic (?)and empowered with solar phallic energy (Set as midnight sun?)."},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"An interesting note (with some biblio-mancy) is that in the last page of chapter 7of Nightside of Eden page 76, Grant brings reference to, \"The Book of Dyzan\", and thenthis heralds chapter 8 (the number of submind and chaos). There also seems to be somerelation to watery primordial teratomas which shall herald a return to chaos -- the OldOnes(?), water signs: Scorpio(?)\"my sun is in Scorpio\". The relation to BABALON alsoholds some connection with BINAH and we definitely have some crone type destructiveenergies here. The number of Babylon is 156 which is also the number of chaos. WithBinah we have links to Set, which was integral with the rite of god-hood. 76=7+6=13and we have a ton of links here, but check out the relations to Gargophias and the 13'thtunnel of Set, in the outer spaces.

This included the summary ofLove under Will, relationships and other issues.IV The Binding of the Mind - The binding of the Mind was theLongest running initiation. This being a categorization ofany, and every, personal demon that the magician has spawnedover his life, a monumental if not impossible task.

Thegraph of a complex value falls on a 2 dimensional coordinatesystem (in these cases; higher dimensional cases areextremely complex no pun intended, and require modificationinto a whole new set of numbers with modified mathematicallaws).
