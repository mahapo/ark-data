And yet, as the building and launchingof ashipis just the beginning of the journey to explore new worlds, so italso is with this work. The Black Ship is an advanced work thatrequires and assumes experience in the magical arts andmaturity in the principles of the Left-Hand Path. And ye! it isalso barely an introduction to the work that it describes.The Greater Book is divided into four lesser Books. Each ofthese four Books, in sequence, represents a deeper level of thatWork.Book one presents the Pandemonium Mandala, which is thebeginning and end of this Work, and the context in which it isconducted. The revelation of the Pandemonium Mandala andthe invocation of the personal Daemon together comprise basic,earthly initiation into Pandemonium, itself. The consecration ofworking tools and personal space begins the process ofmanifesting Pandemonium on Earth. Work is then begun withAncestral spirits, which has many benefits that will be explained.Having worked effectively with this Book, the Magician willhave established the foundation of a House withinPandemonium.Book Two concerns the Royal Blood of Chaos, its origin,nafure and cultivation."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"THE BLACK SHIPBook Three concerns Transmogrification.

This shall be theDominion of Eternal Night."},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"ilCalling Forth theDaemonWithinTn\" Essence of a Daemon is a specific, particula rrzed,emanation or ray of the Black Sun. It unfolds and translatesspecific powers and potentialities of the Black Sun into explicitmanifestation. At the core of your Being, you are this Daemon;which shines in its turn as the Black Sun of a dynamic, innermandala of divine, human and animal natures and drives withinyou, like a great Witches' Sabbat dancing around that centralBlack Flame. These elements are the many identities orsubpersonalities that populate your Psyche or soul and make upthe many facets of the mind.For the purpose of practical Work, the Psyche can bedivided into three levels or aspects. In addition to the Daemon,there are also what can be called the Familiar and the Advocate.The Familiar is concerned with survival, growth and thegeneral thriving of the life force. It controls all of the automaticprocesses and functions of the physical body and filters oursensory perceptions so that they do not overwhelm the attention.The Familiar actually controls much of daily life, including all ofthe routine actions that do not require full, conscious awareness.It is also what is sometimes perceived as the \"inner child\" and isthe source of emotional feelings, thus also concerned withemotional survival. The Familiar oversees the part of the mindthat stores memories and associations. It then interprets these"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"THE BLACK SHIP - BOOK ONEassociations and reacts accordingly when they are stimulated.The center of this Intelligence is often perceived as being in thesolar plexus.What we are calling the Advocate is equivalent to thehuman persona or character, that aspect of Being which peoplenormally identify with on a daily basis and consider to be whothey are. The Advocate exercises the powers of Will, Reason,Imagination and Choice. It sets goals and formulates plans, thenacts in accord with those plans. To show how this aspect ofBeing works, the use of such words as \"advocate,\" \"petsona\"and \"chatactet\" is quite precise. The word \"advocate\" comesfrom Latin that means \" to call,\" which shows the central roleplayed by the Advocate in practical Work. An advocate is also,of course, one who speaks in support of something or someone.\"Persona\" is again Latin, referring to the mask worn by an actor.This calls to mind \"character,\" though this word originally refersto engraving. So, through contemplating the ideas of positivespeaking, playing roles and \"engraving\" words or images, youwill begin to understand what the Magic of the Advocate isabout. The center of this Intelligence is often perceived as beingin the head.The Daemon has been recognized by many cultures andmagical systems. Most notably, these include the personal\"Daimod' of the ancient Greeks and the equivalent \"Genius\" ofthe Romans. The Norse \"FylgSa\" seems to share qualities withboth the Daemon and the Familiar. The Hawaiian \"Aumakua\"has much in conunon with all of these. The \"Holy GuardianAngel\" of Therion (after Abramelin) will probably be mostfamiliar to contemporary Magicians. The Daemon is alsofrequently associated symbolically with birds or winged beingsand it may be profitable to include this symbolism in Daemonicinvocations. The center of this Intelligence is often perceived asbeing slightly above the top of the head, though sometimes it isperceived within the heart.As the Familiar is associated with the subconscious andatavistic levels of the mind, the Daemon is the Intelligence of the"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"CALLING FORTH THE DAEMON WITHINsuperconscious realm of genius and inspiration. In one sense, theDaemon is understandable as an ideal parent (with both fatherlyand motherly qualities). In another sense, the Daemon is like anideal lover. The Daemon knows both the Advocate and theFamiliar intimately and understands and supports them totally.The Daemon is an ever-present guide and mentor. It is also thehidden manifester of the plans and patterns that make up yourreality. Of course, Daemons also comprise their own society orCompany within the realm of Pandemonium. They are all incommunication with each other, weaving their plans andpatterns together in the manner of their nature. MoreIndividuals beco-irg aligned on the human level with theirown Daemonic Being facilitates the manifestation of these plansand patterns upon the Earth.The Daemon is especially concerned with the fulfillment ofpersonal meta-needs. Meta-needs are needs for nourishment andgrowth of Being that go beyond the physiological and emotionalneeds of the Familiar and the intellectual needs of the Advocate.Some essential meta-needs are SeIf- actrralizabion, Self-sufficiencyand Wholeness, Truth and Meaning, Beauty, Perfection andUniqueness, Goodness and justice, Aliveness, Power andFreedom. These ideals may seem abstract. It will be necessary todefine what they mean for you personally and to integrate themconcretely into your Being and life. This is achieved over time asyou bring the elements of your soul together, bringing the Workinto increasingly clearer focus. If you earnestly seekunderstanding and fulfillment of these needs, the Daemon willbe happy and will respond.By consciously adopting and emulating the qualities of theDaemon, the Advocate can be a better guide to the Familiarwhile also drawing the Daemon closer. Of course, the directinvocation of the Daemon is the centerpiece of the Work. Theinsights and inspirations received from the Daemon must thenbe consciously integrated and Remanifested by the Advocate.Like iron filings in a magnetic field, the elements of yourpersonality and all aspects of your existence will in time becomeultimately aligned to the unique pattern of your Daemon. \\A/hich"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"THE BLACK SHIP - BOOK ONEis to say that they become true and integrated manifestations ofyou. This Great Work is what we call Daemonic Integration andbegins with the Invocation and Oath given below. This act marksdeliberate rebirth into the Daemonic race.The basic process is as follows, but may be further enhancedand solemnized as you will. It has been found that writing andsigning the Oath gives greater power to the act. Creation andpossession of the written Oath is not necessary in the way that itwould be with a mundane contract, but its physical creation andsigning seem to anchor the Oath's forging as well as resulting ina talisman or token for later remembrance and use.Will to contact your Daemon and ask for it to reveal itselfand to help in your Becoming.

When the energy has built up into a powerful charge,look straight up into the Daemonic center and blow upward inone full exhalation, sending the power, via the breath, to theDaemon. Note that this part of the operation may be enhancedby simultaneously burning some of the Incense of Abramelin,the recipe for which is given later in this Book.Speak thus to your Daemoni \"Daemon, who are you and wlmtis your Will?

It is understood and expected that readers of thesebooks will be practitioners of diverse systems and styles ofMagic and will thus employ diverse selections of working tools.This is very good, as Pandemonium is a House of manymansions and will require such a multitude of tools in itsbuilding. The few common practices and formulae given belowwill help to loosely align our diverse works with our sharedgoal.The one thing that will be common to all practitioners is arepresentation of the Black Flame of Sapience and Ipseity. Thismay be a black candle, the blue flame produced by jetliedalcohol, an ultraviolet lamp or any other appropriate thing thatmay serve. The candle, lamp or whatever object holds the flameor light may be consecrated as any tool by the method givenbelow. The actual flame or light is consecrated by opening a Gateto the Pandemonium realm. Having already invoked thepersonal Daemon to empower the operatioru this is done bytracing a Pentagram, beginning at the bottom-most point andworking counter-clockwise, while speaking the call to oper!''ZAZAS ZAZAS NASATANATA ZAZAS!'You will also need and want to consecrate whatever othertools that you use in your Magic to the Works of Pandemonium.To do so, create and use a ritual that incorporates the five,essential steps that follow.13"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"THE BLACK SHIP - BOOK ONEThe first step, of course, is to invoke your personal Daemonto be with you and to act through you for the purpose ofconsecrating the tool.The second step is to isolate the tool, to separate it from thematrix of the ordinary. This can be achieved by using a knife tocut the tool out of the world like you would cut an image out ofa picture. If you have the imaginal vision to see them, you mightcut the threads that connect the tool to the world or tear themwith your hands. A special knife can first be consecrated to thispurpose for use in consecrating other tools.Next, create an imaginal duplicate of the tool from the stuffof your mind. Merge the imaginal duplicate with the tool andhave its form and substance be transmuted to your creation.Verbally consecrate the tool with a formula such as this: \"Bytlrc Fire of the Black Sun, I consecrate tlis (tool) to Works of my trueDaemonic Will and to the blossoming of Pandemonium!\" Whateververbal formula is used, be sure to emphasize those three points:the Black Sun, your true Daemonic Will and the blossoming ofPandemonium.Finally, the tool may be anointed with appropriate oilsand/or passed through the smoke of appropriate incense andthen passed through the Black Flame, sealing the consecration.This same general process may be used, with some expansion asneeded, in the consecration of talismans.An issue to consider as an ongoing step is consecrationthrough use. Only use your consecrated tools in those operationsthat further your own Daemonic Will and the blossoming ofPandemonium, use them often for such and the tools willbecome more powerful over time.Incenses and oils have a long history in some traditions ofMagic. They may be used to cense and anoint the body,consecrate tools, hallow space or to bolster specific operations.1.4"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"TOOLS AND FORMULAEFor operations that relate directly to the Black Sun, it may bedesirable to burn benzoin as an incense. The use of benzoin hasan old correspondence to the Pole Star. Because it is the axis ofthe night sky and the mandalic center-point of the astrologicaldecans, long considered to be ruled by specific Daemons, thePole Star can be considered an excellent symbol for the BlackSun and the use of benzoin as incense can be applied thereto.Invocations of the personal Daemon may be enhanced withthe Incense and Oil of Abramelin. The Incense of Abramelin ismade up of four parts frankincense and one part aloeswood (orother sweet wood such as sandalwood or cinnamon), finelyground to take two parts of storax. The Oil of Abramelin, whenmade from essential oils after the fashion of Theriory consists ofeight parts cinnamon, four parts myrrh and two parts galangaldissolved into seven parts olive oil. This is a very strong, fieryform of the oil. Those with sensitive skin may wish to increasethe amount of olive oil. The rising smoke of the Incense ofAbramelin represents the aspiration toward the Daemon, whilethe Oil represents the invoked Essence of the Daemon.For operations that appeal to either the hypercosmic realmof Pandemonium as a whole or to the manifestation andestablishment of Pandemonium on Earth, one might use an oldincense said to draw spirits together. It consists of four partscoriander, one part parsley, a quarter part henbane and a quarterpart hemlock. Take note that henbane and hemlock areintoxicating and ultimately poisonous, and therefore use thisincense sparingly, with proper ventilation and with great care.An alternative might be to burn mugu/ort and bloodroottogether with a pinch of the Incense of Abramelin or a few dropsof the Oil, depending upon the intent of the operation.To honor the Ancestors, as described later in this Book, onecan burn acacia leaves, gum arabic or both together. A blessingherb such as angelica root might also be added. These are goodfor general purposes, but it is also a good idea to research thetraditions of your ethnic history to find appropriate recipes foran incense or similar type of offering.15"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"THE BLACK SHIP - BOOK ONEThis leads into the more diverse use of such magicalsubstances for specific, operative purposes. These kinds ofrecipes and formulae are found in different forms in differentmagical traditions and systems. One of the pursuits of theBuilders of Pandemonium is to research and experiment withAncestral traditions and other forms of folk magic toward theend of employing them in the service of that Work. Oils,incenses, powders and potions used by the Individual forpurification or blessing, fot power and luck, to obtain wealth,ensure victory or to overcome enemies can also be used tofurther the manifestation of Pandemonium on Earth.1,6"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"IVTakirg DominionTn\" spiritual culture of the Daemonic race is primarilyhome-centered. This does not exclude Initiatory or magical workin such Schools, Orders, lodges, covens or other groups as theIndividual finds valuable, but the role of such groups can not beother than secondary by nature. There are several reasons forthis. The essential reason is the decentralized nature ofPandemonium and the mantle of Sovereignty that is upon eachInitiate as an Individual. Secondly, your Sovereignty finds itsgreatest and most immediate focus and expression in your ownHouse as the center of your life and practice. Finally, by takingmagical Dominion of your home, physically, for Pandemonium,you further the physical manifestation of Pandemonium uponthe Earth.First, as with all operations, the personal Daemon should beinvoked for assistance in fulfilling the purpose of the rite. Thisshould be done by all inhabitants that participate.Some kind of circuit should then be made of the property.obviously, this is not necessary for apartment-dwellers and howelaborate you want to make this will depend on yourneighborhood and privacy. In any case, the perimeter of theproperty should be walked, counter-clockwise, using aconsecrated blade, wand, some other appropriate tool or just ahand or pointed finger to trace the border of the Dominion withthe intent of separating it from the surrounding environment.17"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"THE BLACK SHIP - BOOK ONEInside, a representation of the Black Flame should then bekindled and invoked by openirig the Gate with the Pentagram asdescribed in the previous chapter and proclaiming: \"ZAZASZAZAS NASATANATA ZAZAS! Tlrc Gate of Pandemonium isopened and the Daemons conrc forth! Moy the Black Flame etter burnzuithin me/us, tuitlin my/our House, upon the Earth and Beyond!\"At this time, the Black Flame should be taken around thehome so as to purify and empower each room. If it isappropriate, it may then be taken outside to make a secondcircuit around the perimeter of the property.Finally, offerings should be made to the Spirits of Place,both within the home and on the outside property. Culturaltraditions regarding the Spirits of Place are diverse and you willwant to research them and use the ones that resonate moststrongly with your House. \\Atrhether the Spirits of Place arethought of as actual entities, energies or simply personificationsof the special qualities of the home and the relationships therein,they can be ritually strengthened through offerings and workedwith magically. Encourage them to protect the home and itsharmony. Invite them to participate in the Work of establishingPandemonium upon the Earth.Close by declaring that \"I/We haue taken Dominion of thisplace for Pandemonium, that it may hatte a foundntion upon tlrc Earth.So is my/our House established and may it flourish and prosper lrcre.So it is done.\"These are the bare bones of the procedure. You may addflesh to them as you will. The kind of magical oils mentioned inthe previous chapter can be added with related herbs to liquidsoap and water for washing and this practice can beincorporated as part of both the initial and ongoing purificationand blessing of the home. The oils may also be used to anoint thethresholds or other key spots of the home, talismanic objectsplaced around the home and property and also candles forburning within the home. The use of appropriate incenses isobvious.18"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"TAKING DOMINIONYou will also want to create a short form of this operation toreaffirm and maintain Dominion as a reality. This may be assimple as invoking the Daemons, kindling and invoking theBlack Flame and using a verbal formula such as \"May tlrc BlackFlnnte eaer burn uitlin nrc/us, tuitlin nry/our House, upon tlrc Earthnnd Beyond!

Withinthis environment, you can then begin to work with yourAncestors and to enjoy the Lesser Sabbat, as will be described inthe next two chapters. All of this, being interwoven with yourown personal Initiatory and magical work (and, of course, yourlife), generates the home-centered spiritual culture ofDaemonkind and is the strong foundation of Pandemonium onEarth.19"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"THE BLACK SHIP - BOOK ONE20"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"Concernirg theAncestorsCorl.\"rn with the souls of the dead, particularly the soulsof dead family members, is a primal matter in the generalcontext of human spirituality and religion. Veneration of thedead, most especially of the Ancestors, may be the origin ofreligious belief and practice in general. In any case, it certainlywould remain more personal than the worship of deities and hasbeen an important part of many cultures and religions. Thepeoples that have made offerings to their Ancestors and honoreddead have been primitive and refined, ancient and modern, fromall parts of the world. It is actually the cultures that do notengage in this practice that stand out as unusual. Offerings aremade to the dead both to honor and to placate them, as attitudestoward the dead can range from reverence to fear. The ritualsdedicated to the Ancestors also have the purpose of reinforcingthe concept of family.The value of the Ancestors to those on the Left-Hand Pathmay not be immediately evident. Our Path is Individualistic andpersonal. It is often asocial, if not antisocial. The energies withinus are often Alien and we often disregard or disdain such groupties as family. More, as the Left-Hand Path has always been rareand hidden, those who are called to it may often be brought intoserious conflicts with their families, who may be related in bloodbut are seemingly or actually opposers in spirit. Ptainlyspeaking, why would we make offerings to those who are deadand gone, when our goal is our own Becoming? And why would21"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"THE BLACK SHIP - BOOK ONEwe make offerings to the spirits of the parents or grandparentsthat may have never huly known or respected us, or, in somecases/ may have willfully harmed us?The simple fact is that even for those of us that have madesome progress on the Path of Self-willed Becoming, much of ourcircumstance and character, for good or ill, has been shaped bythose who have come before us. For those whose familyrelationships are good, the positive gifts of Inheritance can beacknowledged, honored and celebrated. For those whoserelationships have not been good, there is understanding andhealing to be gained; and death may even have changed theperspective of those shades with whom you have quarrel. Formost, our family relationships are a mix of the good and thetroubled and the Work will also be mixed. Through this Work,we may create a new spirit of family within the Houses that weestablish. However, filial sentiment aside, there are also practicalreasons for working magically with the spirits of your Ancestors.The first reason is that because of their lingering concern forthe welfare of their family and descendants, the spirits of someAncestors will act as practical allies. They can grant insight, helpclear obstacles from your path and steer good things your way.You can ask them to do this always, as a group. You can alsotake specific issues to specific Ancestors based on the professionsor skills that they had in life. In essence, none of this is really anydifferent than seeking the support and assistance of your livingfamily.In addition to feeding the Ancestors, you can also performrites to comfort them or to aid in their spiritual progress. TheAncestors lived as all people live. They both experienced andcaused their share of wrongs and regrets in life. You can useyour Magic to help in healing these conditions. In doing so, youcan help the spirits of your Ancestors, perhaps alleviate some ofthe lingering, present-day effects of these conditions andgenerally untangle any knots in your family's wyrd or karma. Inextreme cases, such entanglements might manifest as a form of22"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"CONCERNING THE ANCESTORSgenerational curse. So, you can see that such Work can benefityou as much as it does your Ancestors.once you have established a relationship with yourAncestors, you can also make them aware of the greater aims ofthis grimoire. You might read to them about the pandemoniumMandala and talk to them about what it means to you and yourplace in it. Then ask those of them that will, those who resonatewith the work, to help you in your efforts to manifestPandemonium in the world. Repeat this now and again, andperhaps more of them will be won to the cause each time.Explain to them that the Pandemonium Mandala represents aglorious world for their descendants to inherit...and, perhaps , forthe Ancestors to be reborn into.Finally, though it may seem simple, in working magicallywith the spirits of your Ancestors, you begin to work magicallywith the basic forces of Life, Death, Time and Beco-i.g.Practical work with the Ancestors begins with setting up ashrine or altar for them. This can be a small, simple space in yourhome. For concerns of privacy and peaceful sleep, it is generallyadvised not to set it up in a bedroom. It can be adorned withphotographs of deceased Ancestors, objects that belonged tothem and items that symbolize your ancestral cultural heritage.Ary photographs used should not also contain images of peoplethat are still living and space should be left for making smallofferings. These offerings can include food, beverages, incense orcandles. The simplest and most essential offerings are candlesand water. You will want to do some research and base yourofferings on what your Ancestors enjoyed in life and what sortof offerings were culturally traditional for your Ancestors intheir own honoring of the deeper Ancestors.Next, you will want to develop a ritual for making theofferings. Again, it would be worthwhile to look into the actualcultural traditions of your Ancestors for doing this. However,these need not be followed slavishly and you can also adopt or23"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"THE BLACK SHIP - BOOK ONEcreate other ritual elements. \\Atrhat follows is a general formatthat covers the basic issues.First, invoke your personal Daemon to facilitate, empowerand guide the rite in alignment with your Essential Self, TrueLife Purpose and Highest Good.Next, call your Ancestors by name. Do the research to get asmany names as you can and call them generation by generationback into history. Include those whose names you have notfound and ask those called to find and bring the others. Then callthe Ancient Ones, whose names are lost to Time. Then call theDeep Ones, whose forms had not yet Become the race of Man,back to the Origin of Life. Invite all of these to rise and comeforth to the feast.You may also call to the shades of those Honored Dead whoare not your Ancestors by blood, but whose lives and workshave inspired and informed the blossoming of your soul.Name and present the offerings.As the Ancestors begin to feed, you may perform prayers ormagic for any necessary healing of the wyrd or karma of yourAncestral line and promoting harmony therein.Finally, embrace the Ancestors and ask them to work onyour behalf in the realms that th\"y inhabit and with the uniqueabilities and knowledge that they possess. Ask them to work onyour behalf to make you healthy, wealthy and happy, and tokeep you so; granting insight, clearing obstacles from your pathand bringing good things into your life. Ask that they protectyou from harm but also embrace you and guide you in the waysof their realms upon death. Promise them that you will continueto give them nourishment, refreshment and progress. Ask thoseAncestors who will, that they Work with you in theestablishment of Pandemonium upon the Earth.How often this ritual is performed is between you and yourAncestors.

It isimportant to understand what this means. The use of the word\"Eternal\" to describe Daemonic Life does not simply mean that itis of infinite duration within Time, though this may be possible.Here, Eternal also refers to the particular quality or nature ofDaemonic Life as emanating from a Source that transcends Timeand its mechanical determinism.

During the physical ritual, then,freely give yourself over to emotion and sensual experience.Blood is a powerful archetype within the Psyche and thisarchetype is aroused by the ritual, which also impresses theFamiliar with the ideas of receiving and sharing this Blood.Furthermore, along with the biological energy produced bymetabolism, the Familiar also creates psycho-spiritual powerfrom food and drink. This process can be enhanced and alsodirected by the will of the Advocate. This will be explained inmore detail in Book Three.

The Daemonicenergy also helps to quicken and transmute the metabolic energyproduced by the Familiar.For these reasons, it is desirable to create a private ritual forthe Sacrament of Blood. As with the Lesser Sabbat, you can makethis as formal as you wish but should not bury its essential corein embellishments. The only things that are absolutely necessaryfor it are a representation of the Black Flame, the wine or otherbeverage to represent the Blood and an appropriate container todrink it from. For the sake of description, we will assume thatyou are using a cup and also have a knife or dagger. Both thecup and the dagger should be consecrated. The essence of therite is simply the opening of a Gate through the Black Flame andthe consecration of the wine, which is done in much the sameway as with any other tool or talisman. Of course, the personalDaemon is invoked first. Then, the Black Flame is kindled andthe Gate opened in the usual way. The wine is then poured intothe cup and consecrated. This can be done by taking theconsecrated knife or dagger and tracing three circles, counter-clockwise, around the cup. The Pentagram is traced again overthe cup and the formula of Opening repeated. Daemonic energyis then focused into the cup by placing the hands around it anddrawing the luminous, blue energy from the Daemonic center tothe heart, and from the heart to the hands and into the cup. Let itflow. If you wish, additional sigils or runes may be traced overthe cup or projected into the wine, along with any Names orwords of power, so long as all of these are truly aPpropriate.

To begin, itmust be explained that this Work is precisely what the human isactually for. It must be made clear that this Work is the purposeof human existence. The human is simply a bridge across theabyss between the animal and the Daemon. This is true of boththe human element within the Psyche and the human species inthe evolutionary process.Animals have an evolutionarily predetermined nature, wayof life and place in their environment. These things areunconsciously programmed into them, and their existence isdefined and restricted by them. However, the human species hasno such programming. The human does not know implicitly,from birth, how to walk, how to build a shelter, how to hunt orselect food or any other methods of securing its own survivaland prosperity. This leaves the human entirely dependent uponits Daemonic gifts of Reason, Imagination and Will. The wonderof the situatiory though, is that these gifts turn humanity'sapparent deficiencies and weaknesses into immeasurablefreedom and power.

It is our proposition that by drawingeven more deeply upon our Daemonic gifts than humanity hasever done before, the species may advance along the bridge andBecome something even greater.The Daemonic influence within humanig is responsible forthe impulse to explore, invent and create. The animal elementwithin humanity seeks only to feed, breed and maintain a levelof basic comfort and is often alarmed by the Daemonicchallenging of the known and the status quo. Sometimes theseelements struggle and sometimes they balance and enhance eachother. This process plays itself out both within the Individualand within cultures.

In applying it toourselves, the process of consecration both as a whole and in itsparticular stages becomes an ongoing practice. The first stage, ofcourse, is concerned with isolation and purification. Thesefactors can be addressed by several different methods workingon several different levels so as to produce quite effective results.To begin, consider your home environment. Doing thisWork on yourself will be more effective 1f you are notundermined by your home environment. A consecrated andpurified living space will support you in your Work.

So, all of this is alreadyin place, or should be, and is simply mentioned here for notingits continuing part in the present phase of the Work.Next, we will consider something like the ancient Hellenicconcept of minsnra. This is spiritual impurity. At its most basic,however, miasma takes the form of physical uncleanliness.

Or perhaps a time whenyou had been ill and did not bathe for a few days? In general,consider a time when you felt physically dirty anduncomfortable. The Familiar can come to feel this way when itperceives the soul to be soiled with psychic \" dirt.\" This psychic\" dirt\" is made up of accumulations of bad thought, bad feelingand general stress. Because the Familiar responds strongly tophysical rites, it is quite simple to make your physical bathingserve double drty as a psychic cleansing rite. Think about thegood feeling of revitalization and freshness after a satisfyingshower or bath. Imagine your Psyche feeling the same way andfor the same reasons. The method is simply to communicate withthe Daemon and the Familiar while bathing and assert andperceive that as the body is scrubbed and rinsed, so is thePsyche. This can be general or applied to a specific issue. Ofcourse, it is also possible to obtain or make soaps that havemagically cleansing herbs or oils as ingredients. Whether specialor ordinary soap is used, it can also be formally consecrated as atool for this purpose.Now, as with your tools and talismans, you will furtherconsecrate yourself by setting yourself further apart fromexternal influence and the matrix of the ordinary.A simple but very powerful method is the intentionalcutting of the connections that link you to people, places andthings that drain your personal power (or Virtue, as we will callit in the next chapter). Most obviously, this refers to how youorganize your life. More subtly, however, it refers to the threadsof attention or energy that connect the Familiar with these thingsthat it has come into contact with.

Ask your Daemon to guide this processin accord with your highest good.This technique qualifies as what is commonly known as aBanishing ritual, though it lacks the usual component ofspecifically defining and warding the personal space of theoperator. Such a component can be added to set a seal on theprocess.

From there, project a smallsphere of power straight forward to a distance of about two feet.Have this sphere travel around your head, tracing a horizontalcircle and returning to its place. From there, next trace an ellipserunning up and over the top of your head, down your back andunder your feet, and then up the front again to rest above yourhead. Trace a third circuit by moving the sphere down one sideof your body, passing beneath your feet, and back tp the otherside to the top. Have the sphere then descend vertically throughyour body and come to rest in your chest at the level of yourheart. Breathing slowly and deeply, imagine that the sphere ofpower then expands with your exhalations into a purifying andstrengthening fire that fills your body and then the space definedby this exercise. Feel free to experiment with the directions thatyou move the sphere and the colors that you imagine. You mayalso prefer to have the sphere come to its final rest in either yoursolar plexus or at the power center said to be at the levelbetween the navel and genitals.57"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"THE BLACK SHIP - BOOK THREEThe effects of this combined ritual of cutting and sealing canbe profound, particularly when it is an ongoing and regularpractice. It centers, purifies and strengthens the entire being.That being said, the process can still be taken even deeper byemploying a psycholgical technique of Dis-Identification. Thistechnique works to further isolate and purify our sense of Self byhelping to dissolve our identification with our bodies, emotionsand thoughts. The secondary effect is that by doing so, it givesus greater control over those elements of our existence byestablishing our perspective as a cause over them rather than asan effect of them.The idea here is that you have a body and that your body isa very useful tool and enjoyable toy, but you are not your body.You have emotions and it is very easy to identify with youremotions when they are strong enough to overwhelm you, butthey are not who you are. They are something very changeablethat you experience. The same is true of your thoughts, ideasand beliefs. People can identify with these very strongly; butagairy they are something that you experience, choose andcreate. Your Core Self is that part of you that is pure perceptionand will. This part of you experiences and uses your mind,emotions and body as an integrated vessel for existence.As a basic technique, verbally or mentally make anaffirmation like the following:\"l haue a body - but I am more tlmn my body, I am my Self, thecenter, the one uln is aunare of my body.

Continue to mentally distinguish between these elementsand your Core SeU. Redefine these things as tools used by you.Conceptually, feel yourself move up (or it't) to a higher (otdeeper) level. From this space and viewpoint, create a moretranscendental concept of yourself by specifying the You whoexists above and beyond the mundane character andcircumstances. Represent this with a word or symbol that canfunction as an anchor for invoking the state again later. Createan image of this Self as a stable center out of which you can liveand express yourself.This exercise can later be extended to include Dis-Identification from specific physical, emotional and intellectualelements as well as all mundane roles, jobs and tasks,relationships or incidents of personal history by makingstatements to the effect that while you may have experienced,done or believed some thing, currently or in the past, that thingdoes not permanently define you. Unless you want it to.Dis-Identification can be added to the Banishing ritual at theend, but it probably makes more sense to incorporate it into thebeginning along with the cutting of threads. After the threadsleading out into the world are cut, the attention can be turned tocutting threads that are perceived in the Dis-Identification. Thesewould be threads connecting our attention to our bodies and ourhabitual patterns of emotion and thought. Do not be hesitantabout this. Remember that truly valuable connections will re-form themselves and that the entire process will be guided byyour Daemon in your best interest.In closing, we will simply comment upon even deeper formsof this Work. Reference was made above to accumulations ofbad thought, bad feeling and general stress. What qualifies as\"bad\" will be discussed further in the next chapter. Here, we will"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"THE BLACK SHIP - BOOK THREEsimply point out that these accumulations can formsubconscious complexes that may need to be addressed bystronger techniques. Likewise, the work of Dis-Identification canturn up emotions, thoughts and beliefs that are not easy tocontrol or change. There are many disciplines for dealing withthese issues and they are obviously beyond the scope of thiswork, let alone this chapter. For the most part, however, thetechniques given here are sufficient to produce powerful results.If stronger medicine is required, these techniques will clarify thatand you can always petition your Daemon to bring theopportunities for change that you need.60"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"ilIThe Cultivation ofVirtueTn\" previous chapter spoke of preparing the Vessel. ThisVessel is the mind and body of the Initiate. It was preparedthrough isolation and purificatiory as well as the particulardefinition of personal space. In addition to separating ourselvesfrom what is foreign to us, this preparation also begins theprocess of gathering and concentrating our own energies. Thisgathering and concentration of energy leads into the next,complementary stage of the process, which is the filling of theVessel with accumulated personal power. We call this personalpower Virtue.Virtue is used as a term because of the different meaningsthat the word has expressed in its evolution from ancient Latinto contemporary English use. In origin, it referred to manlinessand strength, and thus came to mean power. From there, asingular virfue came to be a particular, useful power of a personor thing. In a person, this would be an exceptional quality orskill, such as bravery or cleverness. In a thing, for example, itmight refer to the medicinal qualities of a plant. As general goodqualities, virtues acquired moral and ethical meaning, denotinggeneral goodness or qualities that expressed goodness in someparticular way. (Those who would translate this work into othertongues should be aware of these layers of meaning when doingso.)61"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"THE BLACK SHIP - BOOK THREEThe basic referent of what we are calling Virtue is the forcethat is sometimes known as \"animal magnetism\" or \"libido.\" Ithas also been given many other names by those Individuals orcultures that have perceived it in various times and placesthroughout history. When this force flows freely and strongly,your physical health and vitality and mental powers are high.When Virtue is low, you are more likely to feel weak, tired,irritable and confused. Virtu€, h one form or another, appears toanimate the physical body and all three members of theTriumvirate and to fuel all of their activities. Virtue also appearsto be the fuel of magical operations. This makes it important tounderstand how Virtue is produced and how this productionmay be increased.The most basic form of Virtue is created or extracted byyour Familiar from the food that you eat and the air that youbreathe. The Familiar also handles Virtue with regard to feelingsand emotions, which can either deplete or strengthen thereserves of Virtue. You can truly feel an expansion of Self withcertain emotions and a contraction of Self resulting from others.This shades into the Advocate's handling of Virtue, as there arealso particular mental atLitudes that produce or enhance the leveland flow of Virtue. The Advocate must adopt these attitudesconsciously and train the Familiar in them. This is the disciplineof cultivating specific, personal virfues as expressions of andsupports for the flow of general Virtue. The most essential ofthese cultivated virtues is personal Authority or Sovereignty.Personal virfues such as Courage, Honor, Industry, Wisdom andmany others support enhance and refine personal Authority.These virtues immunize the soul against the attitudes of fear,doubt and pessimism that sap Virtue. The Advocate may furthercreate, transform or enhance the production of Virfue throughdirect intention and visu aLizat:ron The Daemon uses the mostpowerful form of Virtue. This Virtue is capable of shaping realitydirectly. Virtue can be accumulated at each level. The Virtueused by the Familiar can also be sent to the Advocate andDaemon for transformation and recirculation. Physical activityrequires Virtue but also increases the capacity for production ofVirtue on the physical level. The same holds true on the mental62"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"THE CULTIVATION OF VIRTUElevel. On the Daemonic level, the same is also true with regard tothe execution of Magic and the more general exercise of Will.Virtue and Will are tightly intertwined. Experience quicklyand clearly shows that the exercise of Wilt produces an increasein Virtue and that the presence of Virtue also vitalizes the Will inwhat can be truly called a Virtuous cycle. Along with Perception,the Will is the function that is most directly related to the Self.The exercise of your volitional power is what extracts you fromthe matrix of the natural order and results in the Coming intoBeing of a Self. Existence as a Self is experienced as the power toact in distinction to deterministic or coercive influences andpatterns. So, yet again, w€ come back to the issue of personalAuthority. Dionysus spoke to the world of the Will-to-Powerand its infinite superiority against the influence of the milieu andexternal causes. The autonomy to function freely and not becompelled by external forces is a quality that results from theregular exercise of Will. \\Mhat Therion called True Will can bestbe explained as the purest expression of Essence-in-Action. ThisEssential Wilt acts as a meta-force that directs the coordination ofall of the diverse, lesser wills expressed by the different aspectsof Being. \\Atrhen not integrated, the Advocate, the Familiar andthe lesser demons (subpersonalities) all have their own littlewills. These wills can be contradictory and consume a lot ofVirtue to accomplish nothing by acting against each other. Asthe aspects of Being are integrated, as described in the nextchapter, the Essential Will integrates these lesser wills in supportof itself. As each organ in the body functions uniquely as itself tosupport the health of the living whole, so it becomes with theintegrated aspects of the Psyche.Practical techniques follow below.As was said above, your Familiar makes or extracts Virfuefrom the food that you eat. This process can be enhanced bybeing conscious and intentional about it. \\Atrhen you eat a meal,tell your Familiar to make or extract the most Virtue possiblefrom the digestion of the food. You might compose a shortblessing or affirmation for this purpose, such as the one given in63"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"THE BLACK SHIP - BOOK THREEBook One for the Lesser Sabbat. Consider all of the energy thatwent into the raising of the food and its preparation. As you eat,be present mentally and truly savor the appearance, smell, tasteand texture of the food. Focusing on the experience of eating,know that the food is nourishing your body and increasingVirtue. Be grateful to your Familiar and thank it for its help.It ought to be noted that one should not develop a complexabout food. For a variety of reasons, many disciplines havedeveloped special diets for their adherents. It is interesting toobserve that they all seem to work for someone. Even the onesthat are contradictory seem to work equally well for the peoplethat they are suited to. One may thrive on what makes others illand vice versa. There seems to be no one Proper diet except as itsuits the Individual. So long as basic quality and nutrition areobserved, the attitude toward the food eaten seems to be moreimportant than what that food is. \\Atrhile some substances maycontain more potential Virtue within them than others, thepleasure derived from eating the food is an important factor andthis is entirely a matter of personal taste.The breath plays a very important role in the cultivation ofVirtue. Some disciplines employ an entire science of breath withmany different types of breathing exercises for specific purposes.In contrast, the method presented here is a very easy one forusing the breath to accumulate a general, surplus charge ofVirtue for use in various operations. Quite simply, instruct yourFamiliar to generate extra Virfue as you begin a series of relaxed,deep, even breaths. Inhale, allowing the belly to expand, andthen exhale fully but gently and repeat. While doing so, simplyfocus your attention on your breath. Ask and thank yourFamiliar for its help. It may be helpful to begin each day withthis exercise, performing it as or shortly after you awaken.This exercise is greatly enhanced by the use of intention,visualization and emotion as described next. These threeelements greatly increase the amount of Virtue accumulated.When doing exercises such as the two above, INTEND andknow that you are accumulating Virtue. VISUALIZE yourself64"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"THE CULTIVATION OF VIRTUEfilling up and overflowing with Virtue, like a cup filling withwater or a fire blazing up. FEEL and experience radiant feelingsof power and the feelings of well-being and joy that result fromknowing and owning strength.once generated, this basic power can then be directedthrough will and imagination to the Advocate and the Daemon.Instruct your Familiar to do this. You have already been doingthis in the invocation of your Daemon. The sensation of theAnointing experienced at that time is a return flow of Daemonicpower that completes the circuit, to be absorbed by the Familiarand Advocate. The continual generation and circulation of theseforms of Virtue is powerful and effective alchemy. This area ofthe Work can be greatly enhanced by incorporating techniquesfrom previously existing systems and furning them toward ouraims. The methods of inner alchemy developed by the Chineseare very similar to and compatible with our system, and theyogic techniques developed in India for special breathing andWorking with internal energies are also very effective.In support of these methods, regularly petition yourDaemon to assist you in creating a permanent increase inpersonal power. Your thoughtform would be of a permanentlyraised level of Virfue, a strong current of Virtue flowing throughyou at all times and a strong field of Virtue radiating from andsurroundirg you at all times. A11 perfectly integrated andharmonious. Of course, the acfual permanence of your result willdepend upon your Work with complexes and attitudes and withthe growing power of your will. Both that Work and the actualincrease may be enhanced by the use of self-hypnosistechniques.It was said that virtue and will are tightly intertwined. Thegeneral willpower may be initially strengthened through actssuch as formulating a plan and sticking with it, breaking a habitor simply acting in contrast to what is easy or comfortable. Oneeffective method is the execution of useless exercises. Uselessexercises require enough effort to engage the willpower butserve no purpose or hold no reward in themselves. An example65"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"THE BLACK SHIP - BOOK THREEmight be moving a pile of stones from one spot to another a fewfeet away and back again or counting the number of beans in alarge jar. This strengthened willpower and the Virtue producedby it will fuel the execution of your True Will, the perfectexpression of your Essence-in-action.The discovery of the True or Essential Will emerges as a partof the process of Daemonic Integration, which is described indetail in the next chapter. Be receptive to the guidance of yourDaemon and do as you Will.66"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"IVDaemonic IntegrationFo, some time now, you will have been regularly invokingyour personal Daemon. This Daemon is not some far-away godor goddess like the adherents of the Right-Hand Path call to. TheDaemon is a part of you, the deepest and truest part of you, andthus as close to you as your own Heart and Blood. When youinvoked your Daemon for the first time, you simply invited it tobegin to emerge into your conscious awareness. That was justthe beginning of the process. The aim of this Work is theintegration of the Daemon into the human personality. We callthis Daemonic Integration or, more poetically, the Convocationof the Triumvirate. Rather, we should say that Convocation isthe method and Integration is the goal.The first step in this process is to empower the aspect of thePsyche that we have called the Advocate by training the intellectand character. The Advocate requires freedom and clarity ofmind and must be trained in avoiding logical fallacies and inmaintaining semantic discipline and memetic hygiene. TheAdvocate must learn to be mindful and to live consciously. Thepower of the Will must also be trained and strengthened and theAdvocate must cultivate an attifude of personal Sovereignty andSelf-determinism. All of this is beyond the scope of this Book, iscovered in many other sources of learning and should have beenwell begun before you were exposed to this grimoire. If it hasnot been, folr must begin it immediately.The Advocate also has the task of forming a properrelationship with the Familiar. In doing so, the Advocate must67"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"THE BLACK SHIP - BOOK THREEassume a conscious position of Authority over the Familiar andbring the beliefs, values and desires of the Familar intoalignment. Of course, this does not involve bullying the Familiar.The Advocate must act as a good parent or mentor to theFamiliar and earn its trust. Together, the Advocate and Familiarhave the dual task of clearing any erroneous complexesaccumulated by the Familiar and of setting the Familar to itsproper work in the emergence and advancement of theTriumvirate. This is the second step in the Convocation. Again,this is a vast subject and something to be learned elsewhere.The Advocate also has the task of seeking a relationshipwith the Daemon. The Advocate aligns itself and the Familiar inaspiration toward the Daemon and calls to it. As the Daemon isalways huppy to respond, the issue is one of truly listening andbeing able to hear. The primary purpose of the previous twosteps is to facilitate this clear reception. However, the Advocatedoes not only invoke the Daemon passively but also worksactively with the Daemonic material received. Oncecommunication with the Daemon occurs, the Daemon's giftsmust be consciously integrated into the character and expressedin life. This is the third step in the Convocation.Of course, invoki.g your Daemon was the first action thatyou took in your Work with Book One. In the time that haspassed between then and now, that basic link has beenstrengthened and will have begun to produce changes withinyour Being and life. The time has now come for you to learnmore powerful methods of invocation, integration andaffirmation of your Daemonic Self.One very powerful method is the Heart Invocation. Thisoperation is a direct extension of the invocation method that youlearned in the very beginning. The Heart Invocation invokesDaemonic qualities into the Heart and, over time, anchors themwithin the human personality. Consider the Daemonic qualitiesdescribed in Book One as meta-needs. Self-actualization, Self-sufficiency, Truth, Beauty and so on. In performing this HeartInvocation, you will use memories of times when you68"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"DAEMONIC INTEGRATIONexperienced the feeling of one of these qualities. You will conjurethat feeling and use it to invoke more of that quality into yourHeart. If you can not think of an actual memory, think of anexperience from a story that touched the quality in you. If youcan not even think of an experience from a story, simply try toimagine what you think that it would feel like to experience thequality.Perform the basic method of invocation that you regularlyuse, then relax and focus your attention on your Heart. Thismeans your actual, physical heart but also the Core of Being thatthe physical organ often symbolizes. Breathe in and out\"through\" the Heart for a moment. Then, meditate upon one ofthe Daemonic qualities and conjure it within your Heart. Get thefeeling of the quality and keep it flowing for a few minutes andthen send the feeling to parts of yourself and/ or others as feelsright. If the experience feels either blocked or overwhelming,simply relax. Do not try to either force it or restrict it. When youfeel that the process has reached its conclusion, write down anyinsights that you may have experienced.Again, the Heart Invocation introduces Daemonic qualitiesinto the human personality, strengthening the Daemon-Advocate axis within the Psyche. From there, the process ofDaemonic Integration has two further specific aims.The first aim is the harmonious integration of your wholePsyche in all of its parts in greater alignment around theDaemon-Advocate axis. Be aware that this will likely involve thedissolution or rejection of elements that are defective or foreign.As we are seeking a dynamic harmony, tt will probably alsoinvolve the creation of new elements that mediate betweenexisting ones.The second aim is the emergence from this harmoniouspattern of a personal vision and Life Purpose. This is your trueDaemonic Will expressed as Essence-in-action. Once this Willbecomes conscious, it must be acted upon. As Essence isexpressed through action, both the efforts exerted and the69"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"THE BLACK SHIP - BOOK THREEfeedback gained nourish the Essence further. This leads to a newcycle of expression. This is Becoming.Around these basic aims, you will probably want to createrituals and regimens of integration that enhance the personalDaemonic material that you will receive. Some traditionalpractices for Daemonic inspiration already exist, the mostfamous probably being Therion's Liber Sanrckh and the magicalretirement advocated by Abramelin. You can study thesepractices for inspiration but should not imitate them slavishly.Again, as always, your Daemon will guide you.Neither of the aims described above are a one-shotoperation. Their results will emerge gradually. As a guide in thelong-term process of Daemonic Integration, we can identifyseven rough stages of progress. They are rough in that they donot necessarily proceed neatly in discrete, linear steps. Keepingthat in mind, they can be helpful in providing a generaloverview of the Path.The first stage is raw Individualism. This is the essentialbreak with externally determined social relationships andconventions and with Right-Hand Path sentiments. It constitutesBirth and can be very stressful but also very exhilarating. It canhappen as the result of a psychological shock or throughexposure to Left-Hand Path ideas, but it often happensspontaneously. Most of those that end up walking the Path seemto be drawn to it instinctively. Some contact with mature Left-Hand Path philosophy is very helpful at this stage formaintaining growth momentum and for discouraging counter-productive behavior.The second stage is a maturation of the first. The first stagecan often be characterized by u spirit of pure revolt that is largelya visceral, emotional or even aesthetic response that may notinvolve much conscious thought. The second stage emerges withthe development of a deeper and more long-term viewpoint.Here, the primary impulse is to find or create spaces forindulging, cultivating and preserving the explorations and70"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"DAEMONIC INTEGRATIONexpressions of our Individualism, and for protecting them fromthe social mass, against which this stage constitutes a morestable and determined stand than that taken in the previousstage.The third stage is again a further development of thesecond. A comrnitment to the process has been made and thehuman personality develops a parental feeling toward theFamiliar and all aspects of the Psyche, and so reflects theparental feeling of the Daemon. This resonance greatlystrengthens and stabilizes the Daemon-Advocate connection.The fourth stage is defined by an increasing understandingof the essential principles of existing in accord with your owntrue nature. These principles reflect the essential pattern of yourDaemonic will and your personal vision of the Good. Theyinform the personal laws that determine and guide right actionfor your existence.The fifth stage is the dawn of true sovereignty. Theprinciples or laws of the Self become integrated into the humanpersonality, which now consciously governs itself, the otheraspects of Being and your personal existence in accord withthem. The willed efforts that are made and the feedback that isgained in the process of Remanifesting these principles and lawsinto a personal Dominion and ruling it accordit gly will anchorthem within your Being, drawing the self and the humanpersonality even closer together.In the sixth stage, the setf and the human personalitybecome truly and perfectly integrated.In the seventh stage, all aspects of Being and existencebecome harmoniously integrated with the essential, core Self.Having now illustrated a general direction of travel, we canconclude with another very powerful and very appropriateinvocation: that of the Future Self.71"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"THE BLACK SHIP. BOOK THREEFrom any given moment, we can imagine the variety ofpossibilities and choice of action inherent in that moment toopen up a series of possible timelines with alternate futuresspreading out before us. This being so, we can imagine thatsome of these futures are better than others. What if you could.imagine that there is a perfectly acfrralized version of yourself inone of those futures? Could you achieve resonance with thatFuture Self and draw some part of it back into your present lifeso as to make that future more likely to come into being?Invoke your Daemon. Ask it to open Eternity for you and tohelp you make contact with your greatest Future Self. Imagineall of the possible paths and possible futures spreading openbefore you. As you do, use a variation of the Heart Invocationwhere you get the feeling of being totally in the fullness of yourpower and ability. When you have it, send a tendril out into thefuture to find that particular future that resonates with what is inyour Heart. Will the tendril to connect with the Heart of yourFuture Self. When it has, and contact is made, use your breath toestablish a rhythm of communication. On the exhale, send a flowof what is in your Heart to your Future Self. On the inhale, allowEssence, information and energy from the Future Self to flowback into you.Maintain this for as long as you wish and then close withgratitude to the Future Self and the Daemon.72"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"The Magical RaceTnro.rgh a variety of myths and legends from around theworld, the human species reveals one of its most persistentdreams. These myths and legends take many different forms, butthe conunon element is that humanity is not alone amongSapient Beings. This collected body of lore asserts that there areOthers, hidden and apart. These are the myths of the MagicalRace in its infinite variety.As examples, we will look at two of the most enduring andpopular: the Vampire and the F\"y.The Vampire of traditional folklore is a dead person thatreturns as a ghost or animated corpse to feed on the blood or lifeforce of the living. Sometimes, this predation is sexual in nafure,and the Vampire can be related to the Incubus or Succubus.Perhaps because of this, through literature, theater and cinema,the Vampire has captivated popular imagination and has cometo evoke feelings of awe and desire as well as fear. \\Atrhile losingnone of its potency as a predator, its image has evolved into amore complex, refined and alluring mixture of animal, humanand Daemonic qualities and powers, now often wrapped in acloak of aristocratic bearing and aesthetic sensibility.The Fey are related tribes and clans of beings such as thosecalled faeries, elves, goblins and so on. The lore concerning thesebeings shows them to be very complex and even paradoxical innafure and temperament, being simultaneously very wild andvery noble and capable of inspiring both great wonder and great73"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"THE BLACK SHIP - BOOK THREEterror. As personifications of Magic, itself, the Fey are known fortheir eldritch manifestations, strange ways and peculiar relationto Time.It is interesting to note that these legends may have aconunon origin in an element or aspect of the spirit or soul thatcan operate independently of the body. This is a large andcomplex body of lore, worthy of further sfudy, but our sununaryhere must be brief. In the case of the Vampire, this spirit-formmay persist after death and return to visit and prey upon theliving. Living Sorcerers and Witches were also known to be ableto intentionally send this form out for travel while sleeping ordeep in trance. In this sense, which also includes the lore of theWerewolf and other forms of shapeshiftitg, the Vampirepersonifies the darker aspects of Shamanism and Sexual Magic.The Fey, on the other hand, are often considered to be thetransformed souls of the dead. Moreover, there are many storiesof men and women having relationships with faery-wives andhusbands that serve as futelary spirits. In these cases, we can seethese magical mates as manifestations of the personal Daemon inthe traditional wraith-form that was called the \" f.etch\" or \" fylgia\"by Germanic cultures.What does the human see in the Vampire that is soseductive? What does the human see in the F\"y that is soenchanting? It sees itself as it would be: purified of dullness andfreed from limitation, expanded and intensified. It sees itself asits fullest and truest Self, made perfect and amplified. The mythof the Magical Race is a dream-image from the future. It is animage of the coming into being of the Daemonic race. Those whoare called by the Royal Blood frequently seize upon thesefolkloric images because they stimulate what is already inside ofus, like a name or a face half-remembered by an amnesiac.Of course, another type of legendary beings that are evenmore directly comparable to the Daemonic race are the actualDaemons of the grimoire tradition, particularly the seventy-twoDaemons of the Ars Goetia. This Daemonic aristocracy,astrologically arranged in seats of rulership in a circle74"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"THE MAGICAL RACEsurroundirg the Pole Star, provides an excellent, cognaterepresentation of the Pandemonium Mandala, the Court of theBlack Sun. In the grimoire, each Daemon is given a Name andSigil. There is also a description of the Daemon's appearance andof the specific works and disciplines that the Daemon specializesin. Now, it must be said that the model should not necessarily betaken so literally as to equate anyone's personal Daemon withany specific, named entity from the Ars Goetia. However, itwould probably benefit the Initiate to expect and seek some ofthe general attributes of a Goetic entity from his or her personalDaemon. In working to establish and deepen conununicationwith the Daemon, it could be very useful to acquire a Name andeven a Sigil from the Daemon as powerful keys to the depths ofthe Initiate's Being. The same is true of a vision of the Daemon'ssubjective form and appearance, which may be assumedsubjectively by the Initiate during magical operations. Thespecialized knowledge and talents of the Goetic Daemons arecomParable to the specialized knowledge, talents and skills thatDaemonic Initiates will cultivate in the fulfillment of theirunique Will and Life Purpose in accord with the Plan ofBecoming.As was mentioned above, we are often drawn to particularimages, myths and legends that act as triggers of our Daemonicconsciousness. In the same waf r we can be drawn to aspects offoreign (or even fictional) cultures or to particular religious andmagical practices. It is absolutely not necessary that we identifywholly with the source cultures that these mythic, religious,magical or general cultural triggers are drawn from. We may,but it is not necessary. The triggers are reflections of somethingalready inside of us. That is why we should not be confused bytriggers that come from contradictory or even fictional sources.What is necessary, then, is to look into the heart of the trigger tosee what it is in essence. Be aware of your personal triggers,collect them and cultivate them. Find or create spaces in whichyou can comfortably and fully immerse yourself in them, eitherprivately or among intimates. Live your Dream-Selfl if only for atime, and see what emerges further.75"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"THE BLACK SHIP - BOOK THREEIt is magically important to ground these images in art orwriting. \\Atrhatever you consider your level of talent in theseareas, the important thitg is giving the visions a tangiblemanifestation on paper or some other medium so as to give themsome initial foothold in physicality. \\Atrhether you share thesemanifestations with anyone else is entirely up to You, so do notbe timid or censor yourself.

To say that Chaosmic Alchemy isprofound and ambitious Work is to put it very mildly.Something that you should understand, however, is that youhave already been doing it. All of the basic actions alreadypresented in Book One form the foundation of the moreadvanced Works of Transmogrification and Chaosmic Alchemythat follow.The very first step that you took on this Path was to invokeyour own Daemon.

That spaceand substance became, in truth, Pandemonium upon the Earth.You also won the Spirits of Place as allies of Pandemonium. Thisis Chaosmic Alchemy at its most basic. The only issue is scale.Through your Ancestor Work, you began to heal the wyrdor karma of your family and its ongoing effects in the world.You invited your Ancestors to become allies in the Work ofestablishing Pandemonium and you began to infuse the RoyalBlood of Chaos into your Ancestral stream.Finally, in the celebration of the Lesser Sabbat, you re-affirmed all of this Work and began to weave it all together intoan integrated, magical force and pattern. And within thismagical environment, you began to both symbolically andliterally share the Royal Blood as part of a Sovereign Company.Because the Lesser Sabbat is simultaneously both symbol andreality, it provides us with a very real foretaste of Pandemoniumon Earth and is also a magical spell that we cast upon the worldso as to turn the whole world into our Abode of All Daemons. Itis a reality that we should enjoy regularly and a spell that weshould cast regularly.Remember and notice again that even the blessing of theSabbat meal is a formula for the transmutation of substance, aswas explained in Book Three. The offerings given to theAncestors or Spirits of Place and all candles and incenses burnedwith intention can be viewed in much the same way.So while some Initiates of Pandemonium may be moreinterested in the Work of Chaosmic Alchemy than others, all canparticipate on at least this basic level. For all of us, the Workbegins with a renewed and deepened commitment to celebratingthe Lesser Sabbat regularly and fully.82"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"ilThe Greater SabbatIn the previous chapter, we revisited the Lesser Sabbat asthe foundation of Chaosmic Alchemy. Now, we will present theGreater Sabbat. To begin, it is important to understand thedifference between the two Sabbats. Though they are calledsuch, the titles \"Greater\" an:rd \"Lesser\" are not indicative of theirimportance in relation to each other. The Lesser Sabbat is thefundamental and regular expression and celebration ofDaemonic Life and Dominion. Nothing could be moreimportant. The Greater Sabbat, in contrast, is a more rare andmore radical occasion that pushes at the boundaries of thatexperience.The Greater Sabbat is the central Mystery associated withthe Witchcraft of Britain and Europe. This term and context willbe most recognizable to readers now though comparisons canbe made to similar rites in other times and places. The Mysteryof the Sabbat is the experience of a primal pattern of reality. TheSabbat rite is both the symbol and actuality of this primalpattern. We know it as the Pandemonium Mandala.While physical celebrations of the Greater Sabbat havealways occurred and it is the purpose of this chapter to inspiremore, it is necessary to speak of the reality of the Eternal Sabbatfor those who may wish to seek entry to it. Scholars andpractitioners agree that many of the Greater Sabbat experiencesdescribed in folklore occurred in imaginal rather than physicalspace. The \"flying ointment\" used by Witches was a powerfulnarcotic. So, a Witch that experienced flying off to the Greater83"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"THE BLACK SHIP - BOOK FOURSabbat may likely have been physically lying unconscious on theground. This is typical of shamanic flight and scholars andpractitioners might only disagree on the value of the imaginalexperience. Anyway, the True or Eternal Sabbat is considered tooccur in an \" astral\" or dream realm and to be a raucousconvocation of the spirits of the Witches, as well a variety ofotherworldly beings such as spirit animals, faeries and whoknows what all else. One might work to obtain entry to theEternal Sabbat by using techniques of lucid or magical dreamingand out-of-body or \"astral\" travel reinforced by any mixture ofguided imagery, trance induction and ritual methods. Thosewho obtain glimpses of the Eternal Sabbat are very definitelyencouraged to reproduce the sights, sounds and other sensualstimuli of their experiences, together with any magical keysobtained, within the space and time of waking-world GreaterSabbat events.All of these things regarding the Eternal Sabbat being said,it is important to the apprehension of the Mystery of the Sabbatto understand that all manifestations of the Greater Sabbat areEternal. The Eternal Sabbat is the living reality of thePandemonium Mandala. Through our celebrations of theGreater Sabbat, diverse and unique expressions andmanifestations of this Daemonic reality appear as distinct eventsin space and time. These material and sensual expressions andmanifestations can be somewhat whimsically compared to theWitches' toadstools, which appear as the fruiting bodies of ahidden network of mycelia. The space in which these eventsoccur is made ceremonially sacred, or at least special, so thattheir occurrence is removed from ordinary place and time.Magically, culturally and psychologically, the Greater Sabbatalways occurs \"Outside\"...even if it is being held in your livingroom.The Greater Sabbat may occur at any time between sunsetand sunrise and may occur on any night of the year. The GreaterSabbat is held at night, for Night is our Mother and Homeland,and for magical and aesthetic reasons pertaining to the nature ofMystery. Further, revelry, sexuality and Magic are a1l commonly84"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"THE GREATER SABBATassociated with the night. otherwise, our Tradition of theGreater Sabbat is a celebration of distinctly Daemonic qualitiesand is not related to or bound by the cycles of nature, such as theagrarian festivals or equinox and solstice holidays commonlyassociated with pagan celebrations. However, that being said,the New Moon can be a good time for holding the GreaterSabbat as it is the night of greatest Darkness. Also, groups mayenjoy holding Greater Sabbats to celebrate such traditional andfolklore-rich nights as April 30tn and October 3lst, ds well as anyother cultural or self-created holidays that they wish.The following traditional phases of the Greater Sabbat arepresented generally as an example. As the interests of diversegroups will vary, some phases will be emphasized more thanothers. Some may be omitted. New creations may be added. Theproceedi.gs are entirely up to the group.The sabbat is opened according to a ceremonial pattern.The Daemons are invoked, space is consecrated and the Sabbat iscalled forth. A group might use the same formulae and formatgiven in Book one for the Lesser Sabbat, merely adding in theextra phases of the Greater Sabbat. This would be especiallygood for new groups, being a clear and solid way to begin theWork and then allowing it to evolve through experience andinspiration.According to traditional lore, the first stage of the GreaterSabbat proper is when magical works would be recounted andsorcerous techniques would be discussed, perhaps withdemonstrations. Now, the recounting and discussion anddemonstration can simply be extended to the practice of any artor relevant aspect of Daemonic culfure as reflects the interests ofthe group. If the Sabbat is being held in honor of some specialoccasion or person or theme, this is announced.Next, the witches would shift from talk into action,perpetrating specific acts of sorcery to fulfill their goals. If theGreater Sabbat is being held for a special purpose, this is85"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"THE BLACK SHIP - BOOK FOURaddressed now. This is also the time for initiating new membersinto the group.Ecstatic dancing is one of the major elements associatedwith the revels of the Greater Sabbat in traditional lore. Indancing, dny lines that might be drawn between Magic andrevelry become very blurred. Dancing is a great enjoyment formany, a pleasurable form of expression of the Self through theflesh. Dancing may also be an ecstatic method of tranceinduction and the raising and circulation of energy. The Dance isan image of Pandemonium.In time, the Dance would blossom into what is known as the\"Nuptiae Sabbati.\" This is sexual activity. What has been saidabove of dancing is even truer of sexuality. The chaotic,spontaneous expression of the full spectrum of sexuality withinthe Greater Sabbat is an even more explicit revelation andexplication of the impulses, desires, dynamic interactions andexchanges of energy that make up the realm of Pandemonium.Following such exertions, the Witches would replenishthemselves with a great feast. This is yet another Indulgence ofthe senses and another kind of pleasure. In a sense, the entireGreater Sabbat is a nourishing feast and the actual meal shouldreflect this with a diversity of tastes, smells, colors and textures.The tastes and traditions of the group, along with any specialthemes for the Sabbat event, will influence this phase.Finally, a Closing rite is performed that, with the Opening,defines the Greater Sabbat event in Time. The Greater Sabbatoccurs in its own self-created world. However, the GreaterSabbat is also an alchemical work and very much concernedwith material transmutation, so care is taken in the Closing tothen effect an integration of the created Sabbat space with themundane world. Think back to the method for consecrating toolsand talismans that was given in Book One, particularly themerging of the imaginal tool or talisman with its physicalmaterium. In Closing the Greater Sabbat, you should apply thissame process to the Sabbat location as you would to a talisman.86"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"THE GREATER SABBATThe Greater Sabbat may also have an effect on the mundaneworld outside. Lore speaks of the Covendom, a domain ofinfluence with a three-mile radius surrounding the Covenstead,the place where the coven or group meets. And all of this is tosay nothing of the influence that the participants will carry withthem as they go forth into the world.Again, this structure may be altered at will by the group.The interests of the participants, along with the adoption ofspecial themes and events, will make for an incredible diversityof Greater Sabbat expressions. The Greater Sabbat should beapproached as a rare and precious gift that the participants giveto each other.This is a rough map of the Greater sabbat as it has beentraditionally celebrated, but the map is not the territory. Somepeople will read this chapter and feel that it is too brief andlacking in detail. There have been times and places when theGreater Sabbat has had to preserve its methods and lore againsta hostile world. Such places still exist and such times may comeagain. However, the time and place of this writing is somewhatdifferent. It is a time when facts and information are readilyavailable, but people rarely seek out Understanding. Thischapter contains an essential strucfure and some basic keys.otherwise, its purpose is to tease and inspire with leads andhints and an opportunity for exploration. It is a seed that willonly take root and bloom within special, adventurousIndividuals. The skeleton is provided but the reader must give itliving flesh. The Individual who participates in the GreaterSabbat and seeks its Mysteries and experiences them andembodies them will be transformed. The Greater Sabbat is adynamic interaction of strong Individualities sharing ideas,novelties and pleasures with each other as they see fit, Sovereignto Sovereign. Each contribution and each experience is unique,and it is in this intercourse that the Self can define itself, distinctand Sovereign. This is a subtle Mystery.Those who give flesh to this dream will create hidden spacesliberated from the official map of common social and cultural87"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"THE BLACK SHIP - BOOK FOURexperience. Within these hidden spaces, the Eternal Sabbat willgrow and flourish, nourished by the energies of creativity andpleasure. Chunk by chunk, Space and Time will be liberateduntil the old maps are burst asunder, revealing the lush,seething, infinitely creative reality and anarchic conclave ofIndividual Sovereigns that is Pandemonium.88"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"ilIA Sovereigr CompanyTnu vision of the Pandemonium Mandala defines theAlpha and omega of our work. within the realm ofPandemonium, the Daemons form a sovereign Company.Through the process of Daemonic Integratiory the Daemonicrace comes to manifest more directly upon the Earth. The properway to begin building the living society that reflects thatSovereign Company is to understand and embody its essentialnature and principles. We will examine this matter step by step.our process begins with the Black sun. It is the source ofIpseity and sapience. It is Being and through its Being, theDaemons come into Being. The Daemons are particular andunique manifestations of Being. Each Daemon has its ownunique Will and Desires. The infinite uniqueness and diversityof the Daemons make Becoming possible. As the Daemonsexercise their Will and Desire, they Become more. Thus, Being,itself, Becomes more. Through their interactions andrelationships with each other, the Daemons stimulate each otherto Become yet even more. Through the process of DaemonicIntegration, a Daemon increasingly comes to manifest through ahuman personality. Both the special possibilities and inertialresistance experienced through physical existence stimulate evenfurther Becoming.As the Daemons manifest, their relationships will alsomanifest as an earthly society. We of the Daemonic race will beable to enjoy our Company in the flesh and weave our Magictogether more effectively. Together, we will also be able to create89"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"THE BLACK SHIP - BOOK FOURand cultivate that particular form of Magic called Culture.Culture is the fruit of exchange. Suppose that humans lived intotal isolation from each other and only came together to mate.Imagine if every Individual was forced to build their own home,make their own clothes, hunt and grow their own food and soon. No one would have much time for anything beyond ekingout a daily subsistence. Everyone's life would be roughly thesame. A.y clever tricks or insights that an Individual mightcome up with for making life easier or giving it more meaningwould die with them. However, with social exchange,Individuals can divide various labors amongst themselves andspecialize in work according to their personal aptitude and taste.This results in greater personal expression and fulfillment,giving each life greater personal meaning. It also makes itpossible for Individuals to make new innovations in their workso as to accomplish it with greater efficiency and effectiveness.There is time and energy for creative arts. And through socialexchange, all of this innovation and novelty can becommunicated and begins to spread. As a rising tide lifts allboats, all Individuals benefit from this process and can thencontinue it even further.So, while Individual existence is the essential principle ofthe Left-Hand Path, Self-reliance is a key Left-Hand Path virtueand most of us prefer quality over quantity in our personalrelationships, we can see that exchange is essential to the Plan ofBecoming and the manifestation of Pandemonium on thephysical level of existence. More, complex societies and higherlevels of culture also simply offer greater opportunities for theBecoming of the Individual. \\A/hat form of society and culturewould then best reflect and enhance our Daemonic nature? Thisis the central issue of this chapter. The Left-Hand Path and theRight-Hand Path are not just two different approaches tospirituality, they are two fundamentally different orientationsaltogether and approach all aspects of existence in distinctlydifferent ways. This includes different approaches to socialorder. The Right-Hand Path conception of society views thesocial order as a kind of entity in itself, giving it a reality that isequal to (or perhaps, as some would have it, greater than) the90"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"A SOVEREIGN COMPANYreality of the Individuals that make it up. In this view, society islike an intricate machine made up of human parts. Individualsare acceptable and useful insofar as they serve a recognuedpurpose within the established machine. This is a backward andinverted view. Society is not an entity. You can not point to\"Society\" arrd say that it is there. You can point to Individualsinteracting with each other. You can point to buildings (built byIndividuals) that are said to house social institutions, but all thatyou will find inside are Individuals interacting with each other.There is no such thing as \"Society\" in objective reality. Theconcept \"Society\" is, in truth, merely a label for the sum of theinteractions between Individuals. It is a chaotic and seethingmass of living activity, regulated only by the beliefs andconventions agreed upon among the participants or forced uponthem by other participants. As it is the nature of the Left-HandPath to embrace dynamism and Individual Sovereignty, a trulyLeft-Hand Path society would be that in which each Individualis free to bring forth the totality of the best within them andexchange it in synergy with others, with society then morefluidly taking its form from those interactions. Our Sovereignnature and the freedom that is necessary to Becoming makeSovereignty and Liberty the essential cultural values and guidesto social interaction among the Daemonic race. They are thefoundation of Pandemonium as the Abode of All Daemons.Mutual respect among Sovereigns establishes the balance offreedom and stability that makes such a society possible.Often, the first impulse is to focus on this as a political issueand to get involved in political activism. However, the tendencyof most existing political factions is to oppose each other on whatare ultimately mere details. Despite the seeming differences andtribal antipathies of various political groups and parties, they arealmost universally united in their belief in externalizedauthority. They simply disagree on the model to which otherIndividuals must conform, largely as a matter of their ownpersonal values and taste rather than any kind of philosophy.Almost no one disagrees with the basic premise that otherpeople should be forced to conform to someone else's idea ofhow life should be lived and how the world should look. The91"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"THE BLACK SHIP - BOOK FOURtruth of the matter is that this fundamental political problem isonly the symptom of a deeper psychological, philosophical andethical problem. Political activism on behalf of Liberty can onlyachieve minor and temporary results unless the deeper problemis addressed and it is toward this root issue that most of ourenergies should be focused. Without doing so, the most well-intentioned social reformer can be (and often is) transformedinto yet another tyrant by the nature of externahzed authority.All of this is not to say that political activity does not becomenecessary at times, but is simply offered as a wart'ti.g.The lack of Sovereignty is that root problem that we speakof. Psychologically, it is the lack of Sovereignty, both as aconsciously reco gnized principle and as something realized inliving experience, that causes an Individual to look for andsubmit to externalized authority. Likewise, a personal or culturallack of respect for the Sovereignty of Individuals is thefoundation for coercion. These conditions allow many forms ofabuse to flourish within a society, ranging in scale fromdysfunctional relationships to general crime to the greatersacrifices of life, liberty and property demanded by the priests(religious, political or otherwise) of whatever kind ofexternalized authority has come to dominate the society and canbe invoked to ostensibly justify such demands. These are theconditions that have plagued human societies to a greater orlesser degree throughout history.Respect for the Sovereignty of Individuals is expressed inethics by an axiom or principle that has several names but is bestknown as the Non-Aggression Principle. According to thisprinciple, aggression is defined as the initiation of force againstanother Individual or their property. This initiation of force isseen to be a violation of the Sovereignty of others. This is quitesimple and should be easily understood. Violent acts, other thanthose performed in Self-defense (and consensual forms ofrecreation or sport), are commonly considered to be badbehavior. Taking the property of other Individuals is also lookeddown upon. Telling other people what they must or must not dois generally perceived as being impolite. And yet, bodies of92"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"A SOVEREIGN COMPANYexternalized authority, religious and secular, frequently performsuch acts and expect them to be considered justified. Badbehavior is not made acceptable by doing it to a larger group ofpeople, but all that we have said about sovereignty and theresults of its absence explain this strange state of affairs. On theother hand, a society rooted in Sovereignty and mutual respectwould use an ethical guideline like the Non-AggressionPrinciple as the basis of all law. In this society, acts such asmurder, assault, abduction, theft or destruction of property,fraud and breach of contract would be considered crimes.Otherwise, all would be Liberty.Can you imagine it?It is a grand aim but we must begin where we are. We cannot make the growth of Daemonic society dependent uponpolitical processes. We must not wait for our principles tobecome the laws of the land before we can say thatPandemonium exists. We must raise its banner now, to theextent that we can, and say that it has already been born as aliving reality. once invoked, it can begin to grow. The first thingthat we must do is to always hold to and exemplify ourrealizatton of our own Sovereignty and our respect for the likeSovereignty of others over their own lives as the foundation ofour Nobility. If the human societies around us do not respectthese principles, the friction will only serve to strengthen andhighlight that Nobility. But to begin building our own society,we must build connections, conventions and instifutions amongourselves that are rooted in our Sovereign ideals and then wemust begin to teach Sovereignty to the world in whatever wayswe can think of. orly when the psychological and ethicalfoundations have been laid will there be any real hope forpolitical changes. In the meanwhile, we can seek out politicalgroups and institutions that do respect the Sovereignty of theIndividual and freedom of social exchange and use them to theextent that they do respect these principles while steering themtoward a greater appreciation and expression of our ideals.93"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"THE BLACK SHIP - BOOK FOUR94"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"IVThe Dominion ofEternal NightAt this is written, the human species has taken tiny stepsout into the universe beyond its home planet. The first shipshave taken humans to the immediate, outer spaces beyond theatmosphere and to the Earth's own moon. Machines have beensent to Mars and beyond to act as eyes and ears. Howeverslightly, the door has been opened. This brief chapter of ourwork addresses the issue of space migration. It is brief becauseits subject would take volumes to address properly if we beganto go into any aspect of it at length. For that reason, our aim hereis to do two simple things. The first is to introduce the subjectand to highlight its importance by giving it a chapter of its own.The second is to show the relevance of space migration to ourWork and to put it into the context of our Work by emphasizingits Daemonic spirit and character.There are a number of very ordinary, practical reasons formaking space migration a primary cultural endeavor. The mostfundamental is that it is a survival imperative. Catastrophicevents such as the collision of an asteroid or large meteoroidwith the planet or the spread of a global plague could result inthe destruction of civilization and even the extinction of thespecies. Colonies in space, on our moon, on Mars and beyondwould insure that we continue. Extraterrestrial colonies wouldalso provide access to new sources of energy and raw materials.For that matter, the process of space exploration has alreadyproduced new materials, technologies and industries.95"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"THE BLACK SHIP - BOOK FOURObviously, this process of innovation has hardly begun. Yet,in this process, our general knowledge in all fields of science,medicine and engineering has also increased and will increasefurther. Ultimately, all of the benefits to be derived from spacemigration are rooted in the essential situation of moving from asmall, closed environment and growing into a much larger(Literally astronomical!) and expansive environment.With that being said, the subiect then expands into a largerconceptual environment, as well. We are talking about anevolutionary frontier of the greatest significance. The movementof animal life from the oceans to land ranks a distant second incomparison. Whenever the human species has faced a frontier, ithas been stimulated. There is a great surge of Will and creativeenergies within the pioneers. There is renewal andtransformation of both spirit and culture. The frontierrepresented by space migration can be expected to produce thesame effect with a thousandfold greater intensity. The changeswill be profound and will not only be technical and cultural.Darwinian selection and intentional genetic modification aside,the differences in gravlty, magnetic fields and otherenvironmental factors can be expected to cause fairly immediatechanges in the body and in gene expression. Such profoundchanges will demand the greatest increase in our Daemonicpowers but will, as was said, also stimulate them. The Left-HandPath flourishes at the frontier.We know, intellectually, that we live on a planet that hangsin space like all of the other planets and stars that we can see inthe night sky. However, our deep perception is still one of beingbound to a flat, earthly plane, far removed from those astralrealms above that we can only look at and dream about. Deepinside, we yearn for more. For millennia, our Daemonic hungerfor Liberty and Becoming has produced dreams and myths offlight. The full rcaltzation of those dreams in the literal, physicalsense of space migration will begin to alter our perspective in aradical way. The feeling of being tied to a single, firm and daylitfoundation will give way to a more open and somewhat oceanicfeeling.

We were thentalking specifically about our conception of society. In thischapter, we will be talking about our conception of reality.our vision can perhaps best be explained by comparing andcontrasting it with that of the ancient philosophy known asGnosticism. It should be said that the collective label of\"Gnostic\" applies to a number of different schools and sects withdiverse views, ideas and practices. However, these groups didhold a few general beliefs in common. It was generally believedthat there is a strict dualism between Spirit and Matter. The trueGod or Source of Spirit was considered to be completelytranscendent and removed from the universe of Matter, whichwas the creation of lesser beings. These lesser beings mingledsparks of Spiritual Fire with Matter and so created humans.However, the Gnostics generally believed that Matter isintrinsically antagonistic to Spirit and that the sparks of SpiritualFire were imprisoned within Matter in a state of forgetfulignorance, limitation and slavery. The guards and wardens ofthis prison were known as Archons or Rulers. The Gnosis orKnowledge that gives the Gnostic groups their label is the key toliberation from this most unhappy situation. In contrast to thesuperstitious belief demanded by many popular religions, theKnowledge cultivated by these sects is a remembrance of one'strue identity as a spiritual being and a personal experience ofthat inner spark of Spiritual Fire. More exoterically, this99"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"THE BLACK SHIP - BOOK FOURKnowledge might also refer to the special teachings, rituals andpractices that facilitate this experience. Those who are called bythe Source, the Outer God, and who experience this Knowledgewere believed to be able to transcend the rule of the Archons thatkeep humanity ir a dependent and animal state of existence.Some Gnostic groups and other ancient Mystery Schools alsospoke of this process as a resurrection of the dead and liberationfrom the Underworld. Some of these ideas can be found in otherplaces and even still exist in some forms today.The experiences of some of our most gifted Seers haveroughly conformed to the Gnostic model but with some keydifferences and new interpretations. Through our Work, wehave come to know the Black Sun, the hypercosmic Source ofSapience and lpseity. Like the Outer God of the Gnostics, itabides in its own realm beyond the Space and Time of humanexistence. However, we are also well aware by now that througheach seed-ray of obsidian light that emanates from the BlackSun, there comes into being a Daemon. The Daemons are anunfolding, translation and diversification of the Essence andinfluence of the Black Sun into explicit manifestation.Considering all of this, we come to rcalize the inevitable. TheDaemons created the universe. In doing so, the Black Flame, theEssence of the Black Sury was mingled with Matter andultimately led to the coming into being of the human species.As each Daemon differentiates from the Black Sun, itassumes a unique viewpoint. By this action, Space is created.Communication and exchange among these points in Spacemanifest as Energy. Forms created by the shaping of Space andEnergy are condensed into relative solidity as Matter. Thecommunication, exchange and motion of the forms establishesTime. This is how a universe is created. Further, the Daemonsintroduced the force of Life into Matter and overshadowed thespecies of primates that became humanity. The human formprovided the Daemons with the necessary vessel and tool forfurther shaping and refining Matter (and themselves) fromwithin this universe.100"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"CHAOSMOLOGYLike the Gnostics, we can say that there is something of anoppositional duality between the Black Flame and Matter.However, our atLitude toward this situation is quite different.While the Gnostic groups may have had Left-Hand Path ideas intheir sense of being Isolate and Alien with regard to the materialworld, their orientation was ultimately Right-Hand Path incharacter as they sought reabsorption into their Source of origin.This is rather like an infant seeking to crawl back into the wombwithout regard for its own life and development into an adult.The Left-Hand Path is the Path of Becoming, the evolution ofBeing. The Plan of Becoming is that out of the one, the BlackSury come the Many, the Daemons, and the Many enrich andrecreate the One through their further Becoming. For this reason,Initiates of the Left-Hand Path value the dichotomy experiencedbetween the Black Flame and Matter or between Self and Other.The creative tension and friction of that dichotomy, manifestingin different forms and intensities, provide the very nourishmentand fuel for the process of Becoming to occur. This universeengages, tests and develops our Daemonic powers of Reason,Creativif *d Will through our existence within it.If there is any real quarrel with the universe of Matter,Energy, Space and Time from our viewpoint, it is that its usefulqualities as a foil for our development reach a point of extremitythat becomes a true limitation. This would be like an exercisemachine that suddenly jumps to a setting where the resistancebecomes simply overwhelming. The problem stems from the factthat there is only a hair's breadth of difference in attitude, asword bridge, between the Left-Hand Path's intentional use ofthe external environment as a tool for growth and the RightHand Path's dependence on the external environment as asource of authority and validation. Consider the essence of theRight-Hand Path. It draws trust, value and obedience away fromSelf and transfers them to things that are not-Self. It causescravings for the approval and esteem of others at the expense ofSelf-esteem. It causes its adherent to deny the desires, intentionsand truths of his own Being and to replace them with thedesires, intentions and beliefs of external sources. It replaces itsadherent's own Sovereignty with submission to external101"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"THE BLACK SHIP - BOOK FOURauthority. By its nature, the universe of Matter, Energy, Spaceand Time contains this essence, and we are immersed in it. Theuniverse has its own separate, objective reality on this level asknown to the physical sciences and everyday human life. It is theultimate in externalized authority. At some point, in some way,the pull of the universe reached an overwhelming peak thatresulted in a schism. This schism is the cause of the amnesia andlack of consciousness that separates the awareness of humansfrom their Daemonic nature and keeps them in thrall to theiranimal nafure and the apparent limitations of Matter, Energy,Space and Time. We are overwhelmed by our own Creation and\"buried\" within it. This is the truth of the prison perceived bythe Gnostics. What our Seers have further perceived is that if weare prisoners, we are also the Archons that maintain the prison.What seems to be happening is that we are all telepathicallyprojecting a stream of symbols, beliefs and commands into eachother that form some kind of system or pattern of limitation andcontainment. This is happening compulsively and continuously,in the present moment, below our conscious level of awareness.This mutual hypnosis is what keeps us asleep and maintains thestatus guo, keeping us all psychically chained to each other andbound to a narrow band of existence. Those of us that walk theLeft-Hand Path have felt the tug of these chains and know howstrong they are, but even the greatest of us have barely scratchedthe surface of all of this.The sifuation seerns to be as follows. Both the \"world-soul\"of philosophy and the \"collective unconscious\" of psychologyseem to be perceptions of the shared pool of mindstuff fromwhich the Daemons shaped the universe. This pool of mindstuffbeing the underlying substance of Matter would explain theapparent fine-tuning of physical laws to support the emergenceof intelligent life, the apparent role of the observer in affectingquantum events, the phenomenon of synchronicity and thenature of the magical link. It would also seem to be an ultimateexplanation for the Right-Hand Path desire for some kind ofmerging. Collectivist social ideologies, the desire to merge asspirits, the identification with Matter or \"Nature\" and alladmixtures of these may ultimately be rooted in an unconscious102"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"CHAOSMOLOGYidentification with this mass or blob of shared, unconsciousmindstuff and the pull of its gravity, so to speak. In any case,what we are looking at is basically the same as the subconsciouspart of our own Psyche that is personified by what we havecalled the Familiar. The difference is simply one of scale. And so,as our Psyche can have complexes, we can say that the universehas complexes. The telepathic control system described might besaid to be an internalization of these complexes. While most ofour attention is focused on the human level of existence andexperience, we are connected to the Creation through ourFamiliar just as our Daemon still abides within thePandemonium realm. This bridging of the levels exposes us tothe influence of the universal complexes but also gives us thepower to dissolve or alter them.The Individual persons of the Daemonic race shouldprobably accept the universe but we should also keep ourperspective. We created it to further the Plan of Becoming. Itprovides unique and varied opportunities for the exploration ofdifferentiation and creation. However, we have also come toperceive a great barrier within it and within ourselves. As theDaemonic evolution of the human species was a great jump inthe Plan of Becoming, what the Awakened Daemons will do tothe universe will open the way for a significantly greater jump.The way that we propose in this chapter does not intend toescape or undo the Creation as the Gnostics wished. It simplyintends to soften it a little, to open it up a bit. We want to retainand use the qualities which help to further our Becoming whilealso opening the door to greater possibilities.This process involves working to remove yourself from theexternal control of the situation and increasing your own power.It begins in the intellect and the conscious imagination but itmust be taken much deeper, even deeper than what we wouldordinarily think of in terms of working with the subconscious.The locks and chains must be broken at the level where they are.We have already given you practices that can be extended to thisWork. of critical importance is the Non-Aggression principle ofethics that was introduced in the chapter of this Book concerrirg103"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"THE BLACK SHIP - BOOK FOURthe Sovereign Company of Daemonic society. While somepeople come to more fully embody the spirit of the Archons thanothers, it is something that is within all of us as a part of thissystem of control complexes. At the deep level that concerns ushere, the aggression or coercion involved is the enforcement ofwhatever \"rules\" keep us in the human form and bound to theapparent laws of Matter, Energy, Space and Time. Usingwhatever mental and magical techniques that will do the job,working the Non-Aggression Principle deeper and deeper intothe Psyche will begin to weaken the system by removing itsbasic intention or motivation: the desire to forcefully controlothers. The Dis-Identification process and the technique ofcutting threads given in Book Three are methods that can also beapplied at progressively deeper levels and on progressivelylarger scales so as to loosen our bonds.With regard to the ethical dimension of this process, thedeeper internali zalton of the Non-Aggression Principle iscomplemented by the simple but powerful technique thatfollows. When any manifestation of oppression, sickness orlimitation are perceived, confront them with full awareness andattention. Suy to them, aloud or within your thoughts, \"Iapologize. I forgiae you. You are free. Thank yolt.\" As you say these,feel them as strongly and sincerely as possible. This technique isnot intended to excuse or permit the conditions of oppressiorLsickness or limitation. It is intended to loosen our mufual bondsas we work to manifest freedom, health and growth. Based uponour deep-level, Daemonic role as a Creator of the universe, it isintended to address whatever is within us that has contributedto the manifestation of those conditions.The Works that follow are an advanced form of the Dis-Identification that you have been employing since Book Three.They start by addressing the emotional content of the ethicalissue. Begin with an emotion such as Hatre d, for example, andbring up an impression of it in your awareness. Consider it as anobject in your perceptual and conceptual space, and notice thesize, shape or dimensions of it. Do the same for Forgiveness.

Withdraw from the Hatred and merge with theForgiveness, fully experiencing its realig as an active source.Alternate back and forth several times, hating and forgiving,then withdraw into the space between the two and experiencethe emotion between them. Feel the emotion and the conflict-energy between them that maintains them. Now, observe thetwo as made of the same energy. Notice what occurs.The next stage is to work with the control complex moredirectly. It also contains a dichotomy. One side of the dichotomyis the desire to control others out of contempt or anger. This isthe usual conception of authoritarian behavior involving harshrules and enthusiastically executed punishments, out of eitherovert sadism or a sense of vengefulness. The other side of thedichotomy is the desire to control others expressed as love orconcern. Use the same process on this pair.Next, change the process slightly. Run the process on theextreme dichotomy of Absolute Control and AbsolutePermissiveness. Following that abstract dichotomy, bring itcloser to home. Start with the idea that every bit of the pain, fearand misery in the world at this moment is being experienced byothers because you are holding them in that reality. Alternatethis with the idea of letting go and not enforcing anything onanyone. The difference this time is to end both processes on theneutral side of the dichotomy when it really starts to feel realand feel good.None of these processes are intended to devalue or putlimitations upon your emotions or freedom to act upon them. Onthe contrary, their purpose is to increase your awareness andhandle compulsions.The final process in this series should be reserved untilprogress has been made with the previous ones.

Notice its size, shape and generaldimensions. Notice its mass or solid nature. Intentionally mergewith it, identify with it and experience it fully. Expand yourawareness and experience of it until you permeate the wholething, right to its outermost edges. Dis-Identify by realizing thatyou are viewing or experiencing it, and thus separate from it.Withdraw from the mass and notice that you are observing itfrom an exterior, neutral position. Recognize that it is not You,that it is your Creation. Observe the mass as energy. Realuingthat it is made of energy - your energy - observe what occurs asit is seen as energy. If anything remains, focus on that and workthrough the process again. Continue working through theprocess until you are satisfied with the result.This is a basic process and can be used on anything.

Itbegins by exercising your creative imagination in extreme ways.To visualize the universe and alter it in some way, such asalternately collapsing and expanding its Space, making its Timerun backwards or making more radical changes as whimsystrikes us asserts the independence of our inner, Daemoniccreative power from the apparently limited possibilities of theexternal universe.

Quite powerful on its own, it can be enhanced with anykind of ritual process. In fact, this is a core method that will alsogreatly enhance the effectiveness of any magical operation towhich it is applied.

A clear concept orpicture must be formed. Seek the inspiration of your Daemon,then apply your creative intellect to the following steps. Stateyour outcome in positive terms. Describe what you want, notwhat you do not want. For example, if there is something thatyou consider a problem, do not focus on not having the problem.Focus on what would be occurring if the problem did not exist.In any case, focus on what you want to see occurring. If therewas a video recording of the desired situation, what would beseen and heard? That is the focus. As appropriate to theoperation, define the specific context, situation, relationships orenvironment needed for your outcome to occur. What, Who,Where, When and How? And Why? The more specifically thatyou define your outcome, the better that you can manifest it.Being specific tells you exactly what you should be seeing andmakes success testable and measureable.As appropriate, put yourself into the actions andexperiences that you have determined above. Describe yourexperience in sensory-based language. What do you see, hearand feel? What exactly are you doing or saying? Focus on therewards of your manifested outcome. Use your feelings ofsatisfaction from this picture as a motivator throughout theprocess of fulfillment (perhaps making a drawing or collage thatrepresents the outcome). Check for internal congruence. Doesthis outcome conflict with any of your other goals or values?Does any part of you disagree with or resist this outcome?Consider the activities involved in producing this outcome. Howdo you feel about them? Passionate and excited? Or otherwise? Ifnecessary, determine what needs changing and the personalwork needed. Is this outcome what you really want or is it amask for or means to a deeper desire? If so, start this processagain with that deeper desire. Finally, specify the criteria forfulfillment.

The creation of the actual thoughtform is aprocess to be embellished by your own sense of Art andNecessity. The core method is as follows: Relax your body andmind and contemplate your Daemon. Use breath, intention andvisualization to accumulate Virtue. Invoke the Daemon and itswisdom, guidance and creative power. Focus on your clearlydefined outcome and your need for its manifestation. This step isaccompanied by whatever declarations, actions or casting ofimages are considered appropriate to reinforce the thoughtform.Have the vision of the Is-to-Be permeate the depths of yourBeing (via the Familiar) and empower it with Virtue byimagining the pleasures and benefits of its manifestation. Givethe empowered thoughtform to the Daemon and declare thatyour desire shall be.This method can be used to create thoughtforms for any ofthe realities described in this Book. These could be themanifestation of the Eternal Sabbat, the socio-political elementsof Pandemonium as a free Company of Sovereign Individuals,the success of that Company in forging interplanetary andinterstellar civilization(s) and the ultimate mastery of Matter,Energy, Space and Time. For that matter, this method of creatingthoughtforms can and should also be applied to all of the Worksdescribed in Books One through Three, and so the giving of thistechnique is fitting for closing this work as a whole.The magical possibilities for creating and employing thesethoughtforms are limited only by your own imagination.

Pandemonium is a culture rootedin Radical Individualism. As an idea, Pandemonium opens anddefines a new dimension of the Left-Hand Path. This dimensionis essentially that of the connections between the Individual,other Individuals and environments. Previously, theseconnections have not been addressed by the Left-Hand Pathwith the directness and practicality that we have aimed for inthis work. Pandemonium integrates the principles and values ofthe Left-Hand Path with those of Chaos, being a SpontaneousOrder that Becomes as the Individuals, the basic elements thatmake it up, are maximized and undergo their own uniqueBecoming. Ultimately, the Pandemonium Mandala representsnothing less than an integrated spiritual, social and materialvision of a Left-Hand Path civilization.The Pandemonium Mandala maps the pattern of both thehypercosmic Pandemonium realm and the inner world of theIndividual Psyche.
