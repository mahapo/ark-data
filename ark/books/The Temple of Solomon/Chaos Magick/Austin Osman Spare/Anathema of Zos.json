Spare was a watcher onthe threshold. AGAPE of the Christos had spent its force. It laid upon the land as ashroud when once it had been a bright and shining spell of liberation. Under thispall the scorpion bred consciousness in the charnel house of putrefaction.Monsters arose and walked the earth in the guise of living men and women.These are the hypocrites to whom the sermon was delivered. The goat-herd foundhimself in a pigsty; speaking to swine bred on foul aethers. Where once there wasthe sermon on the mount, now there need be a Sermon of the Midden. Zos eatscomplacency and his leavings bear the name of Doubt. Zos heralds the onrush ofthe Beast as John the Baptist once swept the path of the Christos. This time it is notthe oracles' head served upon the platter. Be not complacent. The anthem of LiberL will, on Saturn’s touch, turn its melody inward and become a funeral dirge ofthe Soul. If there is ought to be learnt it is this....we are the hypocrites to whomZos speaks. There is no hope. The Great Wheel turns. All that we love and will isits grist. Nothing Remains.

And at one time, returning to familiarconsciousness, he was vexed to notice interested hearers-a rabble of involuntarymendicants, pariahs, whoremongers, adulterers, distended bellies, and the prevalentsick-grotesques that obtain in civilizations. His irritation was much, yet still theypestered him, saying: MASTER, WE WOULD LEARN OF THESE THINGS!TEACH US RELIGION!And seeing, with chagrin, the hopeful multitude of Believers, he went downinto the Valley of Styx, prejudiced against them as FOLLOWERS. And when hewas ennui, he opened his mouth in derision, saying:O, ye whose future is in other hands! This familiarity is permitted not of thy-but of my impotence. Know me as Zos the Goat-herd, savior of myself and ofthose things I have not yet regretted. Unbidden ye listened to my soliloquy.Endure then my Anathema.Foul feeders! Slipped, are ye, on your own excrement? Parasites! Havingmade the world lousy, imagine ye are of significance to Heaven?Desiring to learn-think ye to escape hurt in the rape of your ignorance? Forof what I put in, far more than innocence shall come out!

Think ye to curb the semen SENTIMENTALLY? Ye denysexuality with tinsel ethics, live by slaughter, pray to greater idiots-that allthings may be possible to ye WHO ARE IMPOSSIBLE. For ye desire saviorsuseless to pleasure.Verily, far easier for madmen to enter Heaven than moral Lepers. Of whatdifference is Life or Death? Of what difference is dream or reality? Know yenothing further than you own stench? Know ye what ye think ye know forcertain? Fain would I be silent. Yet too tolerant is this Sun that cometh up tobehold me, and my weakness comes of my dissatisfaction of you solicit . . . .but be ye damned before obtaining fresh excuses of me!Cursed are the resurrectionists!

Not ye shall I palliateabomination, for in ye I behold your parents and the stigmata of foulfeeding.In this ribald intoxication of hypocrisy, this monument of swindlers'littlenesses, where is the mystic symposium, the hierarchy of necromancersthat was?Honest was Sodom! YOUR theology is a slime-pit of gibberish becomeethics. In YOUR world, where ignorance and deceit constitute felicity,everything ends miserably-besmirched with fratricidal blood.Seekers of salvation? Salvation of your sick digestion; crippled beliefs:Convalescent desires. Your borrowed precepts and prayers-a stench unto allgood nostrils!Unworthy of a soul-your metamorphosis is laborious of morbid rebirth togive habitance to the shabby sentiments, the ugly familiarities, thecalligraphic pandemonium-a world of abundance acquired of greed.

Governed are the meek and ofHeaven earn similar disgust. Your society is a veneered barbarity. Ye areprecocious primitives. Where is your success other than through hatred?There is no good understanding in your world-this bloody transition byprocreation and butchery.Of necessity ye hate, and love your neighbor by devouring.The prophets are nauseating and should be persecuted. Objects of ridicule,their deeds cannot live through their tenets. Actions are the criterion, thenhow can ye speak other than lies?Love is cursed. Your desire is your God and execration. Ye shall be judgedor your appetite.Around me I see your configuration-again a swine from the herd. Arepulsive object of charity! The curse is pronounce; for ye are slime andsweat-born, homicidally reared. And again shall your fathers call to the helpof women. Ye vainly labor at a rotten Kingdom of Good and Evil.

Still would ye feast on my vomit? Whosoever followsme becomes his own enemy; for in that day my exigency shall be his ruin.Go labor! Fulfill the disgust of becoming yourself, of discovering yourbeliefs, and thus acquire virtue. Let your good be accidental; thus escapegratitude and it sorry vainglory, for the wrath of Heaven is heavy on easyself-indulgence.In your desire to create a world, do unto others as you would-whensufficiently courageous.To cast aside, not save, I come.

Only then could Iassure your lurking desire-easy remission of your bowdlerized sins.Criminals of folly? Ye but sin against self.There is no sin for those of Heaven's delight. I would ye resist not norexploit your evil: such is of fear, and somnambulism is born of hypocrisy.In pleasure Heaven shall break every law before this Earth shall pass away.Thus if I possessed, my goodness towards ye would be volcanic.

The law-makers shall have the ugly destiny of becoming subject.Whatsoever is ordained is superseded-to make equilibrium of thisconsciousness rapport with hypocrisy.Could ye be arbitrary? Belief foreshadows its inversion. Overrun withforgotten desires and struggling truths, ye are their victim in the dying andbegetting law.The way of Heaven is a purpose-anterior to and not induced by thought.Desire, other than by the act, shall in no wise obtain: Therefore believeSYMBOLICALLY or with caution.Between men and women having that desire there is no adultery. Spend thelarge lust and when ye are satiated ye shall pass on to something fresh. Inthis polite day it has become cleaner to fornicate by the wish than to enact.Offend not your body nor be so stupid as to let your body offend ye. Howshall it serve ye to reproach your duality?

In time the stench awoke him-for he hadslept amidst the troughs- and he observed that the crowd were no longer with him-that only SWINE remained. And he guffawed and spake thus:Not yet have I lost relationship and am thereby nearly asphyxiated! Caughtup am I in the toils of sentiment, the moral hallucinations within the ebb andflow of hopes and fears?Shall age alone transmute desire? Not yet have I disentangled illusion fromreality: for I know not men from swine, dreams from reality; or whether I didspeak only unto myself.
