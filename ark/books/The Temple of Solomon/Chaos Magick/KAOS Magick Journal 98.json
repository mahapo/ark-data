These are usually mentioned as arising asby-products of religious and mystical activities.In this context they are usually dismissed as ulti-mately worthless or actually harmful astraps for the ego. However, the relation ofpower to knowledge and wisdom need notalways be negative.Power for its own sake, and not as apersonality crutch, can be a valid path tothe supreme reality. The greater powersdemand the raising of the whole man in perfect balanceto the power of infinity.The Western Magician is at a stupendous disadvan-tage. By his unaided will he must overcome his sloth, hisreason, his ego and the cloying resistance of his mind toletting go of the dualities which confine it.

Itthen falls upon the questioner to go to the drugstore orpharmacy and obtain the items, and then carry out therecipe obtained from the Obeahman. This may involvecatching another duppy in order that spirit may fightagainst spirit, if necessary.The word Obeah is thought to have beenderived from the Ibo word “Ubio,” whichtranslates as “a charm to cause sicknessand death.”The Obeah tradition gives dogs the ability to seeDuppys (which may explain the ridiculous amount ofbarking the dogs seem to do in the Hope Pastures area ofKingston), while holding the appearance of a frog in anysituation as a message or omen.Whether the omen or message carries a portent ofgood or ill will, remains open to interpretation, and anObeah Seerís skills are considered as real as a doctorísor a psychiatristís.While Obeah is a source of amusing conversation forthe middle class, for the poor and rural areas it remainsìan important aspect of Jamaican spiritual and culturalreality.î ìAs his slave ancestors, in the equally frighteningenvironment of the plantation, used the rich panorama oftheir African religious practices and beliefs as a means ofspiritual empowerment and survival, (the worker) usesObeah as (a) coping mechanism to sur-vive....îAn interesting feature of Obeah lies inthe steps taken to insure that the spirit ofthe dead can never serve for someoneelseís gain. Obeah calls this ìtying theduppy.î The rope used to lower the coffininto the grave remains buried with the deceased. Whenthe corn begins to grow, the duppy is thus ìtiedî to thegrave.Obeah also provides various methods of protectionfrom duppys, such as the burning of red and blackcandles and the leaving of water and rum standing inglasses. Since Duppys fear sand, those who wish toprotect themselves from a duppy spread sand inentryways and hang horseshoes over doorways. An earof corn washed in ìdead manís bloodî and hung behind adoor protects a place from the unwanted attention ofDuppys. Rearranging the furniture of the house orchanging the color of oneís nightclothes serves to ìfoolîthe Duppy.Obeah takes its roots from the Maccabee Bible, one ofthe portions of text removed from the christianized/sanitized version of the bible known and sometimes readtoday. In Jamaica, the possession of the Maccabee Biblecan result in a ten-year prison sentence, as Obeah re-mains illegal in Jamaica. The churches there rant andrave about how Obeah is black magic and how it is evil.But when things are amiss, members of those samecongregations line up outside the house of an Obeah-man or woman at 5am, in anticipation of the Obeah-person beginning work at 9am. The parishes of St.Thomas, St. Mary and Clarendon have a high concentra-tion of Obeah men and women in Montego Bay, Flankersand St. Maryís.

Writing can bea series of gnoses in itself, and by the very nature ofthe process, I cannot communicate the most ecstatic statesthat went into that process. As Godelís Theorem wouldpredict, it seems that in order to make general statementsabout magick, you have to be ìoutsideî it, in a meta-set ofmagick. Magick then becomes a subset of the writerísconsciousness, identified by certain specifics. What arethose specifics?The existence of magick presupposes various things,the most obvious being the matter of control. Magick isdefined as: causing change to occur in conformity withwill, expanding your achievable reality, the pursuit ofpower, and so on. All these definitions presupposecontrol as the central theme in magick. This is all fineand good, but it illustrates that magick cannot addressissues outside of the sphere of control.These are issues that are usually chunked up intomysticism, and neglected or anathematised by seriousmagicians. This is a mistake, because the half of ourquality of experience is dependent upon our ability to letgo, stop worrying, stop controlling and enjoy. LionelSnell, in a lecture in 1993 (Thelemic Symposium, Oxford,UK), tackled the very point : that, whatever our degree ofcontrol of circumstances, the outcome is not guaranteedto please us.He used to illustrate this duality the tarot trumps ofThe Magician and The Fool. The Magician representsControl, The Fool - Ecstasy. The Magician would like tohave perfect control over the universe, everything goingaccording to plan; The Fool, a mystic, weightless kind ofbliss.Between these two extremes, all magick is performed.Ecstasy is the basis of gnosis; without the counterbal-ance of focussed will, it slides off into unstructured fun.Control is the basis of magickal structures, defining oneíswill in a given situation, but without ecstasy it doesnítgo.

Completing a good, basic training course inmagick marks one out as someone who can persist whenthe going gets tedious, by sheer bloody-mindedness.This self-discipline comes into dynamic tension withflexibility of belief, and together, these are themagicianís core assets.Let us take one of the definitions of magick : thepursuit of power. In the context of magick, what isbe misleading; we might be tempted topass off a sensation of physical energy orof extreme disorientation alone as ad-equate gnoses and be puzzled at thefailure of our sorcery. The physical imageof magical power has a further drawback: itsuggests pushing against some resistance.The resistance most usually encountered in magickoriginates in the wizardís own mind, and the harder hepushes against that, the harder it will push back.This is the paradox of Lust of Result and the sorcerermust apply cunning to circumvent it and succeed in hisenchantments. So, rigidity is a menace to real effective-ness. The Daoists understood this. Power is more like aflow condition, where the magician slips easily from onereality to another, taking his universe with him.Therefore, magick can be seen as the pursuit of powervia the dynamic tension between ecstasy and control.There are plenty of other ways of defining magick, but asstated above, they will all imply control.So, what are the boundaries of magick? Many chaosmagicians have tended to take the view that magick =sorcery: i.e. if it doesnít have some sort of result in con-sensus reality; it ainít magick, but mysticism or religion.To give a counter-example, adherents of Thelema aspractised by the OTO are practising religion, mysticismand maybe sorcery, and subsuming it all under the termmagick. In order to clarify this issue, a few definitions:-1. Religion: A set of beliefs and meta-beliefs thatsay definite things about life, ethics, the universe andperfection, and that thereby give the adherent a sense ofbelonging in the universe;2. Mysticism: The body of philosophy and tech-niques designed to recover ecstatic, unitary conscious-ness. This experience is sought because it leads to agnosis of completeness, wholeness - the ultimate peakexperience, as psychologist Abraham Maslow called it.

Power is the ability to do things. The moreìhorsepowerî or kilowatts an engine has, the more workit can do in a given time.When we do magic, we may employ a physicallydemanding gnosis, such as dancing or drumming forprolonged times, and make some connection betweenour sweated work and our magical power. In our astralimagery we might visualise ourselves growing, swelling,throbbing, shining, crackling, glowing with some sort ofmagical ability.Our visualisation of power in that instance is based onimages of physical power. The analogy of magickal tophysical power is extremely limiting.

The unitaryconsciousness can be identified with the experience ofthe non-local quantum mind, unconditioned awareness;3. Sorcery: Making things happen in consensusreality according to will;4. Self-transformation: Making things happen toconsciousness according to will.This latter category gives us problems. This type ofmagick is defined by Pete Carroll as Illumination, whichhe subsumes under Enchantment, as in enchantmentupon the selves. However, once we start talking aboutchanges in the selves, we are talking about states ofconsciousness that can operate upon other states ofconsciousness.The operating state sounds suspiciously like the HolyGuardian Angel if we ditch the usual metaphysics associ-ated with that concept, and if the desired result of theIllumination magick is openness to ecstatic states, thenthat would be mysticism, wouldnít it? These themes areexplored further in Chaotopia! So, what are our defini-tions of magick?CARVING UP THE BEASTMagick is like a multidimensional entity, a concept solarge that it touches everything. By its very nature, mostof it is hidden in the domain of the mystery, eternallypursued by the questing mind. A system is a set ofstructures within that incomprehensible hypersurface; anAeon is a slice through it.There is no absolutely, satisfactory system, meta-system or meta-meta-system. At best, a book on magickis an evaluation of technique wrapped around a believ-able meta-model. We all cut through the beast at anangle decided by our obsessions, and that is exactlywhat I shall be doing. The question I ask when I comeacross a theory is: What use can I get outof this?Magick is a delicate art with a low suc-cess-rate, at least initially. The motivationfor it is non-ordinary; generally, if I can dosomething without magick, I will. Magickstretches your boundaries, gives a sense and an intelli-gence to life, allows the development of purpose.We choose our worlds all the time; we affirm or denysome fact or other many times a day.

This partially explains the phe-nomenon of beginnerís luck in magick - when I firststarted doing sorcery, I had a great run of successes.Then it stopped. It was a while before I realized I hadpunctured my own naivete and had to think (dammit!)again, come up with a new belief shift which would re-enable my sorcery.Sophistication can be pain in the arse. As we getmore conscious of this process, the effects get moreobvious, and we are forced to choose our beliefs evermodel of magickal activity, utilizing AustinSpareís concept of organic belief:1) SELECTION OF OUTCOME ==>2) GNOSIS ==>3) EMBEDDING OF NEW (ORGANIC)BELIEF ==>4) EFFECT OF ORGANIC BELIEFON CONSENSUS REALITYCareful and precise selection of outcomes is vitallyimportant, but the techniques for doing so exist in therealm of mundane psychology. Gnosis means alteredstate of consciousness, which is likely to be a familiarconcept to any reader of this book.The embedding of organic belief is the tricky bit: themind has to be presented with the parameters of the newreality you want in a way which does not conflict with thebeliefs already in the unconscious. Belief becomesorganic if presented to the unconscious mind in a con-gruent way, embedded within an appealing paradigm.A powerful gnosis can shatter the bonds of belief, butthe magick is vitiated by unconscious resistance to theimplications of the new belief, unless the mind has beenprepared, oiled as it were, by the most appealing para-digm shift.When we aim our paradigm shifts with subtle accu-racy, we may find that we are capable of a much morepowerful magickal action or we may achieve the sameresult with only half the strain and twice the pleasure.To use Spareís phrase, we are making our own sacredalignments, homing in on the point in consciousness thatmakes the magick possible in that moment. Unconsciousresistance is undoubtedly the commonest cause ofmagickal failure.This makes the selection of belief a major theme inmore carefully. This is when we start to have strongopinions about what meta-beliefs to hold, when we startto construct our own Chaotopia. Chaotopia is neitherUtopia nor its opposite. It is what Austin Spare called,the chaos of the normal, seen through an illuminated eye- the eye of the sorcerer.This is also the point where we can be said to beunderstanding the patterns of our true will. The uni-verse, in the guise of our own unconscious/greater mind,presents us with limitations like the above. These crisesinvite us to jump us out of obsolete frames of referenceinto new creative approaches.Amongst the hordes of definitions of magick, the one Ilike best at present is: The technologies of organic belief.This forms the basis of a very generalized and simplified To use Spare’s phrase, we are making ourown sacred alignments, homing in on thepoint in consciousness that makes themagick possible in that moment."},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"13Summer ë98Kaos MagickJournalenabling or disabling your magick.It is also the area in which most controversy takesplace, thereby the most interesting reason for whichbooks on magick continue to be written.ECSTASY AND THE QUESTI mentioned above the notion of belief systems wear-ing out. There is more than one reason why this hap-pens, it is also a mechanism by which the wizard isforced to evolve. What forces this?Phil Hine has pointed out that engaging in gnosis forsorcery eventually has the effect of reprogramming theselves, even if there had only been intention to repro-gram oneís consensus reality (sorcery) before.In other words, the magician is forced by an accumu-lation of transpersonal gnoses to revise his concepts ofwho he is and what he wants to be.At the top of the simple hierarchy of needs (Maslow,Dilts) lies the mystery that some have called a tangledhierarchy, which generates individual consciousness outof the quantum plenum, out of universal mind.Repeated experience of higher states of conscious-ness eventually leads to some experience of the coreparadox of individual being.The mind starts asking questions like:Why do I come down?Why donít we just get ecstatic when weíve finishedour dayís work?What is the origin of individual consciousness?Why does the ego keep wittering on in its tediousinternal monologues of past-oriented identity, and whatcan I do about it?How can I get back to unconditioned mind?The occasional extra bit of money, sex, personalpower, healing, no longer satisfy; everything is muddiedby the taste of the ego. Transformationbecomes urgent.TRUE WILL VERSUSRANDOM BELIEFPete Carroll (in Liber Null, 2nd edition) isat pains to banish the notion of True Will in favour ofRandom Belief, and denies that there is any guidingprinciple to decision-making other than conscious orunconscious impulse. To experience and appreciaterandomness as a guide to action, Carroll recommendsDice-Living and Random Belief exercises.Why do we perceive the egoís endless demands as sosickening? It sounds to me like a case of what has beendescribed as option anxiety, the paralysis felt when oneis confronted with choices. This is one of the endemicsicknesses of the postmodern world, and its cure is notrandomization of beliefs or behaviour; that is just givingup on the burden of choosing.You cannot achieve release from a system whilst usingthat system - Godelís theorem again. Random beliefexercises are excellent training modules; they assistdeconditioning. They are obviously not a basis for aregular way of life, and in fact, the exercises tend toteach you what your real values are.So, what do we need to know in order to make deci-sions? Firstly, we need to have a basis for making thedecision. In other words, we need to know our criteria.This generalizes into our values, which are more univer-sal kinds of criteria. Secondly, we need to know therelationship of our values and criteria to the particulardecision we are contemplating.These things can be known by a combination of logicand introspection. What needs emphasizing is that theintrospection part of the process involves checking forthe signals in your body and feelings when you exploreeach idea; your intuition, once you have learned to listento it, will provide you with the answers.

You will probably get a sensation of somekind, this is a congruence signal. Now repeat to yourselfa desire-sentence about which you have some doubt orfear.You may experience a different sensation, which maybe an incongruent signal. Experiment with differentformulations of the desire-sentence until you feel quite adifferent sensation.In a world ruled by change, the mode ofexpression of your true will is bound toshift.The problem with this definition is thatyou can never articulate this grand designin any clarity, because that articulation initself would limit your responsiveness tonew situations. A useful operational definition of truewill is: the vector sum of all your desires at any givenmoment.This definition assumes nothing about the futurecourse of your life and can only give you a snapshot ofyour Will, frozen in time. However, this Will-of-the-mo-ment is all you can know, at any given time, about yourwill; thus it is perfect for that moment. This form of willcan be elicited using congruence signals any time youneed to.The above type of procedure brings the conscious andunconscious desires into alignment by inviting the un-conscious totality to express itself. This will result in aconsiderable strengthening of oneís intuition.It becomes increasingly possible to steer oneís life bythe ëfeelí of situations - all the information about anydecision is present in the feelings of the body, if one canonly learn to interpret and trust them. At various pointsin oneís magickal development, it is unavoidable that, inorder to attain liberation from past circumstances andconditioning, one feels totally alone and in opposition tothe world.A background of work with conscious-unconsciouscongruence gives one the strength of certainty, whichenables acceptance of oneís own terrible uniqueness,oneís burden of freedom, the Monstrous Soul.Editorís note:This article is adapted from Dave Leeís latest book,CHAOTOPIA!

If you persist with such techniques,it becomes rather like dowsing.Some form of congruence testing is a powerful tool formagick because you have at your disposal the entirecommittee of selves whenever you want to clarify yourwill.A rather vague definition of true will might be: thedriving force behind the grand sweep of your life.However, unless you believe in a deterministic (19thCentury) universe, there is no room for a deterministicnotion of your destiny."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"15Summer ë98Kaos MagickJournalEarlier this year, a friend of mine asked me to assist herin a banishing or breaking of bonds rite.

Pho-tographs, letters they had given to Client S or evenscraps of their clothing or hair.With an assurance that Client S could provide some-thing suitable we made the arrangements for the ritual,booked the baby-sitters and circled the date on thecalendar in red ink. Everything was set to go.Is it just me or does everyone suffer from this sort ofsetback? Come the appointed day, at the appointedhour, Client S arrives with no subject links at all. As I didnot know all of subjects: A, B, C, D and E, there was littleI could do to change the situation. ìTime to improvise,î Ithought.A lot of my magic relies upon improvisation. This isnot due to a willful rejection of standard ceremonialmagic nor a deliberate drive toward discordianism. Itseems to arise out of sheer necessity as if by accident.What has become significant is how many times thecontents of my kitchen cupboard have saved the day. Inthis instance, after a quick rummage through the cup-board under the sink and checking the biscuit tin, wewere back on course for the ritual.Our ingredients included a 27 pence pack of Nettoísginger biscuits, a red, checked dishcloth, a chopping-board, a hammer and a black marker-pen.We began the eveningís work with the Gnostic Penta-gram Banishing Ritual and then made our statement ofintent: ìIt is our will to break all emotional and intellec-tual bonds between Client S and A, B, C, D and E.î CueHannibal T.

Gone were the bothersome folkwho had been plaguing Client S (after theirbrief incarnation as biscuits). The pigeonswere well fed and Client S was free fromstress once more. All this for only 27 pence - a bargainby anyoneís standard.I mentioned the advantages of cheap biscuits to afellow magician soon after the ritual and he was greatlyinterested. He had been experiencing problems withsomeone and despite several months of cursing them,they were still around.The thought of breaking bonds by bashing biscuits soappealed to him that he even went as far as makingsome biscuits for the purpose of the rite. However, themain reason why I mention him is that he had a ratherwicked, little twist to add to the biscuit technique.After he had finished hammering the biscuits tooblivion he did not throw the crumbs to the birds. In-stead, he put them inside some silver foil which he usedto wrap around a wax image of his enemy, bound ittightly and buried it deep in the earth. According to him, this would inflict upon his enemy aìcrumbs in the bedî type of skin irritation, which if it didnot drive them mad, was certainly as cruel a curse asanyone dare give.

Sometimes omens are in-dicative of vast historical currents.Since these address public affairs,they will generally be public dis-plays and will often be reported inthe media.Here is such a report distributedby the Knight-Rider syndicate, asprinted in the New Haven Register ofTuesday, 8 November 1994:Crash kills 4 slowed by motorcadeMUNDY TOWNSHIP, Mich.óA fiery crashon Interstate 75 south of Flint that left fourpeople dead Monday began when a Tractor-trailer plowedinto traffic slowing to a crawl as President Bill Clintonísmotorcade passed nearby.....(p. A8)The story goes on to say that the truck hadbroadsided a car that had cut in front of it to turn ontothe median, apparently in an attempt to avoid the con-gestion by making a U-turn. This started a chain reactionthat took out six other vehicles. Several caught on fire,including two of the three new Saturn cars the truck washauling. The truck driver survived, but the police did notsay if he would be charged with any crime. The Presidenthad been on his way to address a crowd at the Universityof Michigan-Flint. And of course the news the next day was thatPresident Bill Clintonís political party had suffered aflaming crack-up at the polls, and he was now going tohave to deal with Republican majorities in both houses ofCongress. This accident is thus a perfect example of anominous event, classic in its link to its subject, in itstiming, and in the explicit character of its message. Thelink to the President was intimate because his presencecaused it, but only in the most detached sense, sothereís no way it can be seen as any kind of Freudianslip.Traffic slows to a crawl for lots of reasonsóconstruc-tion, accidents up the road, tollsóand when there arepile-ups then, it is no omen. But the timing here was soprecise. It was the day before the election and becausethe top Democrat was making a campaign stop, fourpeople were incinerated in a lake of fire. So of courseOMENSStephen Mace"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"18Summer ë98Kaos MagickJournalthe Democrats lost both houses. The details of the story also carry meaning. Fourpeople were killed, and four is the number of completionand stability. This to me emphasizes that the old Con-gressional status quo is finished and destroyed. Also, thecars the truck was hauling were Saturns, and Saturn isthe planet of limit, form and Fate, again stressing thatthis political shift is no triviality.On the other hand, I see no indication here that a newRepublican dynasty will result.. It was a lake of fire, not atruckload of cantaloupes spilled out for anyone to gather.Besides, the driver of the car the truck broad-sided wastrying to make a U-turn is not likely to solve it. Some-thing more creative is obviously required, and I doubt theRepublicans have it in them.ominous event is tiny compared toClintonís portent, and indicative of a warn-ing rather than a fait accompli, but then aloverís spat averted is possibly a smallerthing than a political turnabout.At least a crowís caw takes less energyto arrange than a flaming crack-up; onlythe timing of its call makes it in any way out of the ordi-nary. And the energy contained in a situation is, I thinkthe key to the production of any ominous display of thatsituationís essential dynamics. On an even less energetic level are meaningfulìaccidents.î Perhaps instead of hearing a crow caw asone mentally berates oneís sweetie, one will cut oneísfinger along with the carrot.The dynamic is the same, but the mechanism is con-tained within the subjectís personality, and so no occultor paranormal interaction need be hypothesized. So we have spectrum that ranges from public topersonal to strictly private portents, and this spectrumcan be nicely interpreted as one that ranges from greatenergy to trifling. Politicalsea changes create lots ofecstasy and anguish, andthe anticipation generatedbefore the event by thehundreds of thousands ofpeople who will be directlyaffected by it should besufficient to spawn someimpressivesynchronicities.But when Iím thinkingmean thoughts about mysweetie, thatís just me,and so the coincidence isa small one. And if Iím notpaying attention, Iíll missit. When we look at omens as being pro-duced by the psychic energy within a situa-tion, the similarity of their dynamic to thatof conjuring becomes clear. Another detail is that the truck driver survived, justas Bill Clinton is still in office. And if the Republicansmake a mess of it, he could well be re-elected in 1996óprobably running on his ability to roll with the punchesand turn disaster to good account. But thatís still up inthe air. After all, the police hadnít decided if the truckdriver was at fault. So much for the portentous extreme. At the otherend of the spectrum are omens that occur subtly to oneísperson.

Of course this"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"19Summer ë98Kaos MagickJournal When we look at omens as being produced by thepsychic energy within a situation, the similarity of theirdynamic to that of conjuring becomes clear. Omens occurwhen a situation has a power overload that discharges asan event analogous to the way the energy is moving inthe situation.This overload usually occurs because the situationcontains more significance than the people involved in itwill acknowledgeónot to other people nor even to them-selvesóand so the tension is kept from conscious releaseand must instead manifest in an objective display. Withconjuring, on the other hand, we use artificial means tooverload the situation with power, in hopes that it willdischarge as an event that will help us get what we want.Itís the same dynamic, except that omens are itsnatural occurrence, and conjurationís its technical exploi-tation. Finally, we should consider the subject of omens inconjuring. Briefly, they donít mix well, If youíre conjuringand you get any omen more impressive than a flight ofbirds or a break in the clouds, then that is energy wastedon display, energy that should be working to manifest theresult you desire. Nor should you divine after conjuringto see how well it went, since the energy that worked theoracle would also be wasted.The best omen a conjuration can produce is a resultthat accomplishes our wills. But this is not to say that you should ignore orrepress recognition of a decisive omen if such shouldappear; it may be telling you to change your procedure,your strategy, or your view of the situation you want toaffect. I can recall an occasion when a friend of mine setup a ritual designed to destroy the negative thought andhabit patterns within the participantís personalities.We were each given a dark and light piece of cake. Wethen entered period of gnosis wherein we identified thedark pieces with the negative aspects of personality, andlight pieces with the positive. Finally we ate the lightpieces and put the dark one into an ornatesilver plate bowl where they were to bedestroyed. The fuels for destruction was aquantity of pure grain alcohol. Curiously,however, almost as soon as the cakes wereset alight, the bowl began to melt, drippinghot metal all over my friendís nicely finished table. Thefire was hastily smothered, the ritual aborted. The darkcakes, incidentally, were scarcely even warm. (A goodOmens occur when a situation has a poweroverload that discharges as an event analo-gous to the way the energy is moving in thesituation.wick does not burn.) The omen was obvious to everyone except thehost, though he had to admit the sense of it once it wasexplained. This is simply that negative personality pat-terns can never be destroyed; if we try, weíll destroytheir containeróour total selvesóbefore the negativity iseven touched.Further research has convinced me that the energythese negative patterns generate can easily be trans-formed into positive powers without changing the habititself at all.The trick is simply to be aware of our pathologies aspathologies (and not justified responses to an awfulworld), and then synthesize spirits or servitors whosesole function is to shift the energy from its negativeapplication into something we can use.Thus may our pathologies be made profitable, eachother engine to augment the momentum of our wills."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"20Summer ë98Kaos MagickJournalQ.
