[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"Dontent1 of 57/29/2004 5:26 AMICE MAGICAn initial viewby Frater U.'.D.'.In the colder regions of the earth, especially so in the area of the Polarcircle around the North Pole, the elementary survival of man and animalalike, in their struggle against the most unhospitable powers of natureconceivable, certainly met with a challenge greater than anywhere else. Itis no coincidence that it is amongst the tribes and peoples from the mostnorthern regions of our planet that one finds the cradle of technologiesand knowledge, the mechanisms and efficiency of which surpass allothers. Their description is but one of many tasks which the book IceMagic meets in an befitting and serious manner.At some point in the course of the past months and years the author tookthe liberty of tentatively labelling all forms and contents pertaining to thistopic as \"Ice Magic\" in his conversations and lectures. This mere title ledsome people to the wildest speculations and most absurd fantasies. Addto that the intermingling of only half understood information, rumours andpure conjecture, as has actually occurred, and the claim by others tounderstanding or explanation of the meaning of \"Ice Magic\" cannot butlose every base in its very conception. Hence the need for thispresentation!It seems to be the fate of well-meant improvisations aiming at a crudelysimplified and easy to grasp introduction to a world of paths hithertountravelled and possibilities never exercised, to raise many a latent fear,as well as stimulating the proverbial bias of the timid and diffident,wavering and demure towards prejudice of any kind, which serves toprotect such people from reality.There are a great number of better reasons, albeit including thosementioned above, to supply a general entree for the expert and theinterested public alike to this realm of highly powerful and fascinatingpractices, techniques and legacies.When taking into account its history, the term \"magic\", like a blank pieceof paper, is most forbearing and receptive for all sorts of conjectures -possible and impossible alike. But when it comes to the power and theskill i.e. the ability of human beings to act in a manner transgressingconventional rules and \"laws of nature\", this long-suffering term shouldbe more than apt to spell out all exactions and assertions concomitant."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Dontent2 of 57/29/2004 5:26 AMbe more than apt to spell out all exactions and assertions concomitant.Granted that the well-known formula, \"Magic is the art and the science tocause change with the aid of alternate states of consciousness inconformity with will\", to take but one example, may represent a firstnotion when undertaking to describe the subject matter at hand. After all,it shows distinctly the insufficiency of those presumptions and tools weare forced to employ when approaching this taboo-ridden field. Therecourse to psychologisms and mysticisms contained in this formuladocuments man's initial difficulties when relating to magic, as he hasdeveloped a constitutional preference for suppression, evasion andcompensatory conjurations when confronted with a complex world andreality.From its very inception, the permanent presence of paramount forces ofnature which man's claim to life has to face in the polar region, disavowsany refuge to tests of endurance, training, exercises or even vacant spacefor trial and error, for experimentation and even instruction in theconventional sense. With winter temperatures ranging from -45øC to-70øC (minus 49øF to minus 94øF) for four to six months in the year,intensified by wind speeds Beaufort 3 to 11, accompanied by an extremelylow humidity and a minimum of 3 sunless months per year, the smallremaining span of time can leave but scarce and far too little scope for thegrowth and bloom of survival resources.Obviously, such unsurmountable and merciless circumstances attendantto sheer human existence in theses climes demand unexampled qualitiesof the development and exertion of man's magic. Thus, a magicelementary, innovative and consequently highly intelligent, becomes themost obvious and self-evident requirement. Its main characteristics aresobriety and efficacy, for the conditions of its evolution and practicalcircumstances leave no scope for games, sentiments or the temporarydecline into a bland consumer's attitude. Therefore, an improvisedformula within this context could read: \"Magic is the art of being able todo without aid, embellishment and conditions in the course of achievingto one's interests.\"It is only logical that translating such a clear-cut, uncompromising craftand the highly sophisticated and most sensitive of sciences inseparablylinked with it, into our comparably soporific social environment with all itspretensions, complexes and diversions, in a teachable form must meetwith considerable difficulties. Certainly, this magic is more practicableand efficient than everything else. But it is for this very reason that it alsoinvokes fear and disconcert within those souls orientated towards readyconsumption and essentially content with the current status quo.The book, \"Ice Magic\", finally clears the path towards a practical and"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Dontent3 of 57/29/2004 5:26 AMThe book, \"Ice Magic\", finally clears the path towards a practical andtheoretical introduction to this demanding magical art which subscribesto efficacy alone. It makes itself available for understanding, examinationand personal practice by well-defined laboratoria, a reasonableprocessing of experiences, stories and traditions and last but not least bythe systematical examples corresponding to this magic, of itstransposition into our cultural and environmental realms.To take one example: the author's instructed attempt to employ the ambitof a different and consequently redirected bio-organization with theobjective of mastering enormous difficulties by traversing the limitationsand contingencies/ possibilities of a bird, left him with the distinctimpression of actually having been a certain bird. In accordance with hispossessive bents, the question became unavoidable, whether he couldnot become a bird for a longer, yet limited period of time (and thus, surely,even more tangibly). However, the reply was prompt to come: \"Are youreally willing to trade your possibilities and your point of departure now?\"Faced with the clearly outlined experience and the most tightly tautenedcontrast he realized immediately that this was not his pursuit. Theensuing question, whether he would now easily be able to overcomethose tremendous difficulties which claimed and restricted his cardinalattention and to leave them behind, placed no demand on confirmation.He knew.It is owing to his preoccupation with Ice Magic and its bearers that theauthor has primarily attained to a freedom of individual, untrammeled andsocially uninterlaced uninhibitedness only truly developable now. Heunderstands this uninhibitedness as a consequence and a presuppositionof that vast field of magical skill which, however, commonly hides itselfbehind the horizon of conventional magical hopes and efforts. It is onlythe preeminence of individual emancipation and the fulfillment of desireswhich, to his present knowledge, grant those premises free of strictureand retroaction, to share abilities, knowledge and power with others andto push them far beyond their limits. However, he is certain that it is onlyon the basis of individual acceptance that the way is clear towardsalliances however limited and temporary, but reliable. Assiduousfriendships will then be no longer the product and object of wishing andpure expectation but rather a growing, logically established chance andpossibility.The spirit carrying and stimulating ice magical practice in its mostconsiderate and freedom-loving manner may be best described by thefollowing small anecdote."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Dontent4 of 57/29/2004 5:26 AMDating back to the turn of the century and before, several attempts weremade to settle the tribes of the Lapps (Samer) by offering them land,obviously with the goal of integrating them into the predominant socialorder and to make them as governable and controllable as everyone else.Without being clearly aware of the social and political dimensions andimpact of these settlement designs, it was a Samer himself who succintlypointed towards the enslavement and hazards entailed with these offersof settling down. The proposal to settle him and his clan permanentlyalong with dwellings, farmsteads and agriculture, while taking intoaccount their traditional way of life by guaranteeing that, following theirformer life of unrestricted and unentangled moving about, their futurehomesteads should keep a minimum distance to the next settlement orany neighbouring houses of at least 5 kilometer (3.25 miles), met with hisspontaneous and apprehensive comment. \"How,\" so he demanded of thepeople in charge, \"can one expect human beings to live in such closevicinity with others?\"Finally, an ice magical manifesto can be introduced along with the book,whose sole design is to provide encouragement and suggestions forthose people who relate to the pursuit of freedom, expertise and growth inmagic to organize, or, at the very least, emancipate themselves for thefurtherment of their individual research without the jeopardies involved inthe aberrations and derangements of power politics - and withouttherefore sooner or later being fettered hand, foot, soul and spirit only tobe thrown back consequently in their quest. The ice magical manifestowill show real and feasible possibilities of manifesting this spirit, providedappropriate interest is given.PUBLISHERS' NOTEThe complete book in german has been published already.Whether \"Ice Magic\" will be published in English (certainly not an easytask for any translator) will depend on sufficient public interest.Thus, anyone interested in an English language edition is kindlyrequested to notify the publishers and will receive notice from them assoon as this project may manifest in a tangible form.
