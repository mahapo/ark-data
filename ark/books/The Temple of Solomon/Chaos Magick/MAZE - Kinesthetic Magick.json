[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"Kinesthetic Magick by MAZE sean@hairyjedi.net The Sensation I start with the premise that each person wants to experience both itself and the matrix more fully. By doing so, it attracts and creates far better (more intense) sensations for itself. The difference between attracting and creating sensations are typified in an ancient Chinese symbol most people are familiar with, the yin-yang. To experience the difference involves a meditation. The experience is kinesthetic, which means you feel it, and what's more: you feel it within yourself. Most meditations involve either visualisations or feeling outside of yourself, such as watching or feeling your breath. The nose is a long way from centre, and we are feeling inwards. All meditations are valid to the people of the matrix, some have more intense sensations around them, some give us what we are questing for, whereas most don't. If you wish to feel the difference between yin energy and yang energy do this meditation. I'll explain the difference more fully shortly. Preparation: This is the same for both meditations and is a fairly common meditation in itself. Sit with your back straight, perhaps on a chair as I prefer, or else on the floor, or perhaps lay down and start by taking a few slow deliberate breaths and close your eyes. Allow your consciousness to roam freely within your body, settling eventually in your toes. Focus on the feeling within your toes and feel the space within your toes. Move to the sole of your foot leaving just the shell of your toes, i.e. your toes are empty space. Move your consciousness upward within your body: toes, soles, feet, heels, ankles, calfs, shins, knees, thighs, buttocks, anus, sexual organs, hips, kidneys, stomach, inner body, lungs, heart, slowly up the spine, throat. Then along the arms, doing each finger one at a time, hands, wrists, fore-arms, elbows, biceps & upper arms, armpits, shoulders, nape, neck, chin, mouth & tongue, nose, eyes, third eye, ears, back of head, top of head then inside head. I've found it useful spending 10-15 minutes emptying the body/feeling the space until the whole body is felt to be empty space. The consciousness is then directed to the centre of your body, let your consciousness sit quietly centred for a short time, surrounded by the shell. The heart region is the centre of the body for the purposes of this and the following meditations and is called the heart chakra, in Eastern texts. Yin: Once you are centred to your own satisfaction, that is, your consciousness is at the heart chakra: let go of the shell which is to say fall through the shell. The feeling you'll have is of falling and the energy is yin. There is a point where consciousness says \"hang on!\" and you climb back up. You then need to create the space within your body again, though it can be done much more rapidly as you deem fit. Centre yourself again and drop again. Note the feelings you get, but avoid intellectualising just yet. This isn't head-stuff. These are physical energies you're learning how to experience. "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Yang: To best feel the difference between Yin and Yang, follow straight on from the Yin meditation once the feelings have been noted. On alternate meditations, start with the Yang then follow with the Yin. Centre yourself again, placing consciousness at heart chakra, then direct your consciousness now to your innards as you breath. Trace a mental circle within your body starting below the navel, breathing in: tracing around to the top of the lungs then breath out: tracing the circle down the other side within yourself. Get a good circle within yourself. Once you've got the circle happening within yourself, feel the sensation you have at the upper and lower points of the circle, that is, between breathing in and breathing out. Feel the Yang at these two peaks within each cycle. Chi: It took me 3 attempts at this meditation before I felt the difference so persevere if the results aren't felt on first go. After 6 attempts or so, the difference between Yin and Yang energies becomes blatantly obvious and I can feel the difference now, as easily as I can feel the keyboard under my fingers. The combination of Yin and Yang energies results in the basic substance of life, Chi, which goes under various names. In English it is best described as the LifeForce, or just the Force for 2 reasons: - It encompasses death. - I'm a fan of Star Wars. Before continuing with more techniques, I'll explain the difference as a combination of what I've read and of what I've felt. These 2 energies have different charges. I'll join the consensus by calling Yang \"positive\" and Yin \"negative\". Yang is a creative energy, a potential; Yin is a passive energy, a void to be filled. Yang is described as male and Yin as female. I feel these descriptions as inaccurate and wonder where they originated. Perhaps the social standing of women at the time, being more passive, caused these descriptions. More likely, it has to do with the physical qualities of women and men. The sexual organs are manifestations of Yin and Yang. However, the sexual difference between Yin and Yang energies is not relevant today. Women and Men have equal access to Yin and Yang energies. I know I do. The Taoists describe the first manifestations of Yin as the Moon (Thai Yin) and of Yang, the Sun (Thai Yang). [Almost?] all mythologies describe the Sun as masculine and the Moon as feminine, assumingly because the Sun was active and the moon was passive. I agree that calling the Sun Yang; and the Moon Yin is more accurate than the sexual descriptions of these space bodies. I am talking about energy, and access to energy here. The energy spurned by the combination of Yin and Yang, results with Chi. This is far more easy to experience than the two as separate entities. Simply, sit still and upright with your hands about 2 feet apart palms facing each other. Put your consciousness between your hands (feel what is there) and slowly bring your hands together until you feel the barrier between them (about 3-6 inches apart for starters). This is Chi energy that you can feel. If you have troubles with this, rub your hands together deliberately and try again. I have no doubt that you will feel this. Many people can see it too, usually it is of an electric blue colour or else [as I do] a golden sphere, though to date I don't know the difference. Often visualising the golden sphere helps in bringing the energy to your fingertips. Visualize one of the 2 colours as you deem fit, but not white, as many books and teachers recommend. White is Pure Yang energy, and the quest for enlightenment needs to be balanced with the quest for endarkenment if it's quested at all, in my honest opinion. Let me explain how I define some terms: Enlightenment is the attainment of a pure Yang energy. The enlightened direct what they are doing, and know where they are going, and how to get there."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"The enlightened usually arrive where they are Heading. The energy is one of potential, of movement, of creativity. It is the active force in the matrix. Endarkenment is the attainment of a pure Yin energy. The endarkened finds something to do, and knows how to [literally] ride the flows of energy in the matrix. There is a powerful intuition attainable with endarkenment. The energy is one of acceptance, of being moved, of inspiration. It is the passive force in the matrix. Based on these definitions, neither can be labelled \"Good\" or \"Evil\", nor can they be labelled \"Masculine\" or \"Feminine\", but labels and definitions vary widely in the spiritual communities. I base my definitions on my experience. Your experiences may be different. An example may help to illustrate, that of a painter. Painter Yang, has an idea, gets the necessary equipment, and paints with a great deal of passion producing a masterpiece. Painter Yin, has an idea, gets the necessary equipment, and relaxes. Yin lets the art be it's own inspiration and produces a masterpiece. It remains to be seen what Painter YinYang, aka Painter Chi, can do. So, you've now created an energy sphere in your hands. This can be quite potent, yet there is more power available elsewhere. Put your palms flat on your thighs and re-enter the empty space within your whole body. Instead of generating the Force within your hands, you generate it at the heart centre, and have your centre of consciousness there. It's a little harder to get started with this energy, primarily due to us always using our hands, and never spending much time feeling our hearts. Once it is felt (connected with consciously), the power raises many times over. Also note if you can feel that the energy from heart centre is different to the energies of the hands, and different parts of the body. Accurately, the higher on the body you stimulate energy within, the higher the frequency of the energy. A common mistake is to believe that higher = better. There is a whole science of the different parts of the body and their energies, which deserves it's own later section. Known as chakras. Naomi Ozaniec writes in her discussion on the raising of the Kundalini Force up the chakra network: \"The spinal network of energies is a vital part of the subtle anatomy of the human individual. The chakras are strung upon the inner column of sushumna [the spinal meridian] like jewels on a necklace. It is this central column which unifies the separated chakras into a whole. It is possible for high levels of energy to rise up from the base chakra through the spinal nadi [meridian] and dramatically affect all the chakras simultaneously.\" The chakras, are more than that. They are matrices within the body. Each has it's own energy, each can be felt. There is a ritual called the Middle Pillar, published by various authors. This ritual is calling the energy downwards. If you are a student of rituals such as this, experiment with going upwards and note the difference in energies available. If you have experienced your own energy to some degree of definite success, you may desire to enter a group structure."}]
