Success with these techniques is aprerequisite for any real progress with the initiate 3° syllabus.A magical diary is the magician’s most essential and powerful tool.It should be large enough to allow a full page for each day. Students shouldrecord the time, duration and degree of success of any practice undertaken.They should make notes about environmental factors conductive (or other-wise) to the work.Those wishing to notify the Order of their intention to begin thework are invited to do so via the publisher.13"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"MIND CONTROLTo work magic effectively, the ability to concentrate the attention must bebuilt up until the mind can enter a trance-like condition. This is accom-plished in a number of stages: absolute motionlessness of the body, regula-tion of the breathing, stopping of thoughts, concentration on sound, con-centration on objects, and concentration on mental images.MotionlessnessArrange the body in any comfortable position and try to remain in thatposition for as long as possible. Try not to blink or move the tongue orfingers or any part of the body at all. Do not let the mind run away on longtrains of thought but rather observe oneself passively. What appeared tobe a comfortable position may become agonizing with time, but persist!Set aside some time each day for this practice and take advantage of anyopportunity of inactivity which may arise.Record the results in the magical diary. One should not be satisfiedwith less than five minutes. When fifteen have been achieved, proceed toregulation of the breathing.BreathingStay as motionless as possible and begin to deliberately make the breath-ing slower and deeper. The aim is to use the entire capacity of the lungs butwithout any undue muscular effort or strain. The lungs may be held emptyor full between exhalation and inhalation to lengthen the cycle. The impor-tant thing is that the mind should direct it’s complete attention to the breathcycle. When this can be done for thirty minutes, proceed to not-thinking.Not-ThinkingThe exercises of motionlessness and breathing may improve health, butthey have no other intrinsic value aside from being a preparation for notthinking, the beginnings of the magical trance condition. While motion-less and breathing deeply, begin to withdraw the mind from any thoughtswhich arise. The attempt to do this inevitably reveals the mind to be araging tempest of14"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"activity. Only the greatest determination can win even a few seconds ofmental silence, but even this is quite a triumph. Aim for complete vigilanceover the arising of thoughts and try to lengthen the periods of total quies-cence.Like the physical motionlessness, this mental motionlessness shouldbe practiced at set times and also whenever a period of inactivity presentsitself. The results should be recorded in your diary.The Magical TrancesMagic is the science and art of causing change to occur in conformity withwill. The will can only become magically effective when the mind is fo-cused and not interfering with the will. The mind must first discipline itselfto focus it’s entire attention on some meaningless phenomenon. If an at-tempt is made to focus on some form of desire, the effect is short circuitedby lust of result. Egotistical identification, fear of failure, and the recipro-cal desire not to achieve desire, arising from our dual nature, destroy theresult.Therefore, when selecting topics for concentration, choose subjectsof no spiritual, egotistical, intellectual, emotional, or useful significance -meaningless things.Object ConcentrationThe legend of the evil-eye derives from the ability of wizards and sorcerersto give a fixed dead stare. This ability can be practiced against any object- a mark on a wall, something in the distance, a star in the night sky -anything. To hold an object with an absolutely fixed, unwavering gaze formore than a few moments proves extraordinarily difficult, yet it must bepersisted in for hours at a time. Every attempt by the eye to distort theobject, every attempt by the mind to find something else to think of, mustbe resisted. Eventually it is possible to extract occult secrets from things bythis technique, but the ability must be developed by working with mean-ingless objects.Sound ConcentrationThe part of the mind in which verbal thoughts arise is brought undermagical control by concentration on sounds mentally15"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"imagined. Any simple sound of one or more syllables is selected, for ex-ample Aum or Om, Abrahadabra, Yod He Vau He, Aum Mani PadmeHum, Zazas Zazas, Nasatanada Zazas. The chosen sound is repeated overand over in the mind to block all other thoughts. No matter how inappro-priate the choice of sound may seem to have been, you must persist with it.Eventually the sound may seem to repeat itself automatically and may evenoccur in sleep. These are encouraging signs. Sound concentration is thekey to words of power and certain forms of spell casting.Image ConcentrationThe part of the mind in which pictorial thoughts arise is brought undermagical control by image concentration. A simple shape, such as a trian-gle, circle, square, cross, or crescent, is chosen and held in the mind’s eye,without distortion, for as long as possible. Only the most determined ef-forts are likely to make the imagined form persist for any time. At first theimage should be sought with the eyes closed. With practice it can be pro-jected onto any blank surface. This technique is the basis of casting sigilsand creating independent thought forms.The three methods of attaining magical trance will only yield re-sults if pursued with the most fanatical and morbid determination. Theseabilities are highly abnormal and usually inaccessible to human conscious-ness, as they demand such inhuman concentration, but the rewards are great.In the magical diary, record each day’s formal work and whatever extraopportunities have been utilized. No page should be left blank.MetamorphosisThe transmutation of the mind to magical consciousness has often beencalled the Great Work. It has a far-reaching purpose leading eventually tothe discovery of the True Will. Even a slight ability to change oneself ismore valuable than any power over the external universe. Metamorphosisis an exercise in willed restructuring of the mind.All attempts to reorganize the mind involve a duality betweenconditions as they are and the preferred condition. Thus it is impossibleto cultivate any virtue like spontaneity, joy, pious16"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"pride, grace or omnipotence without involving oneself in more conven-tionality, sorrow, guilt, sin and impotence in the process. Religions arefounded on the fallacy that one can or ought to have one without the other.High magic recognizes the dualistic condition but does not care whetherlife is bittersweet or sweet and sour; rather it seeks to achieve any arbitraryperceptual perspective at will.Any state of mind might arbitrarily be chosen as an objective fortransmutation, but there is a specific virtue to the ones given. The first is anantidote to the imbalance and possible madness of the magical trance. Thesecond is a specific against obsession with the magical practices in thethird section. They are:1) Laughter/Laughter2) Non-attachment/Non-disinterestAttaining these states of mind is accomplished by a process of on-going meditation. One tries to enter into the spirit of the condition when-ever possible and to think about the desired result at other times. By thismethod, a strong new mental habit can be established.Consider laughter: it is the highest emotion, for it can contain anyof the others from ecstasy to grief. It has no opposite. Crying is merely anunderdeveloped form of it which cleanses the eyes and summons assist-ance to infants. Laughter is the only tenable attitude in a universe which isa joke played upon itself.The trick is to see that joke played out even in the neutral and ghastlyevents which surround one. It is not for us to question the universe’s ap-parent lack of taste. Seek the emotion of laughter at what delights andamuses, seek it in whatever is neutral or meaningless, seek it even in whatis horrific and revolting. Though it may be forced at first, one can learn tosmile inwardly at all things.Non-attachment/Non-disinterest best describes the magicalcondition of acting without lust of result. It is very difficult for humans todecide on something and then to do it purely for it’s own sake. Yet it isprecisely this ability which is required to execute magical acts. Onlysingle-pointed awareness will do. Attachment is to be understood both inthe positive and negative sense, for aversion is it’s other face. Attach-ment to any attribute of oneself,17"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"one’s personality, one’s ambitions, one’s relationships or sensory experi-ences - or equally, aversion to any of these - will prove limiting.On the other hand, it is fatal to lose interest in these things for theyare one’s symbolic system or magical reality. Rather, one is attempting totouch the sensitive parts of one’s reality more lightly in order to deny thespoiling hand of grasping desire and boredom. Thereby one may gain enoughfreedom to act magically.In addition to these two meditations there is a third, more active,form of metamorphosis, and this involves one’s everyday habits. Howeverinnocuous they might seem, habits in thought, word, and deed are the an-chor of the personality. The magician aims to pull up that anchor and casthimself free on the seas of chaos.To proceed, select any minor habit at random and delete it fromyour behavior: at the same time adopt any new habit at random. The choicesshould not involve anything of spiritual or egocentric, or emotional signifi-cance, nor should you select anything with any possibility of failure. Bypersisting with such simple beginnings you become capable of virtuallyanything.All works of metamorphosis should be committed to the magicaldiary.18"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"MAGICSuccess in this part of the syllabus is dependent on some degree of masteryof the magical trances and metamorphosis. This magical instruction in-volves three techniques: ritual, sigils, and dreaming. In addition, the magi-cian should make himself familiar with at least one system of divination:cards, crystal gazing, runesticks, pendulum, or divining rod. The methodsare endless. With all techniques, aim to silence the mind and let inspirationprovide some sort of answer. Whatever symbolic system or instrumentsare used, they act only to provide a receptacle or amplifier for inner abili-ties. No divinatory system should involve too much randomness. Astrol-ogy is not recommended.Ritual is a combination of the use of talismanic weapons, gesture,visualized sigils, word spells, and magical trance. Before proceeding withsigils or dreaming, it is essential to develop an effective Banishing Ritual.A well-constructed banishing ritual has the following aspects. It preparesthe magician more rapidly for magical concentration than any of the tranceexercises alone. It enables the magician to resist obsession if problems areencountered with dream experiences or with sigils becoming conscious. Italso protects the magician from any hostile occult influences which mayassail him.To develop a banishing ritual, first acquire a magical weapon - asword, a dagger, a wand, or perhaps a large ring. The instrument should besomething which is impressive to the mind and should also represent theaspirations of the magician. The advantages of hand-forging one’s owninstruments, or discovering them in some strange way, cannot be over-emphasized. The banishing ritual should contain the following elements asa minimum.First, the magician describes a barrier about himself with the magi-cal weapon. The barrier is also strongly visualized. Three dimensional fig-ures are preferable. See figure 1 on page 20.Second, the magician focuses his will on a visualized image: forexample, the image of the magical weapon, or his own imaginary thirdeye, or perhaps a ball of light inside his own head. A sound concentra-tion may additionally or alternatively be used.19"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"Figure 1. Different forms of three-dimensional barriers that the magician can cre-ate with the magical weapon.Third, the barrier is reinforced with power symbols drawn with themagical weapon. The traditional five-pointed star or pentagram can be used,or the eight-pointed star of Chaos, or any other form. Words of power mayalso be used.Fourth, the magician aspires to the infinite void by a brief but deter-mined effort to stop thinking.SigilsThe magician may require something which he is unable to obtain throughthe normal channels. It is sometimes possible to bring about the requiredcoincidence by the direct intervention of the will provided that this doesnot put too great a strain on the universe. The mere act of wanting is rarelyeffective, as the will becomes involved in a dialogue with the mind. Thisdilutes magical ability in many ways. The desire becomes part of the egocomplex; the mind becomes anxious of failure. Soon the original desire isa mass of conflicting ideas. Often the wished for result arises only when ithas been forgotten. This last fact is the key to sigils and most forms ofmagical spell. Sigils work because they stimulate the will to work subcon-sciously, bypassing the mind.There are three parts to the operation of a sigil. The sigil isconstructed, the sigil is lost to the mind, the sigil is charged. In construct-ing a sigil, the aim is to produce a glyph of desire, stylized so as not toimmediately suggest the desire. It is not necessary to use complexsymbol systems. Figure 2 shows how sigils may be20"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Figure 2. Creating a sigil by A) The word method, B) The pictorial method, andC) The mantrical method.21"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"constructed from words, from images, and from sounds. The subject mat-ter of these spells is arbitrary and not recommended. To successfully losethe sigil, both the sigil form and the associated desire must be banishedfrom normal waking consciousness. The magician strives against any mani-festation of either by a forceful turning of his attention to other matters.Sometimes the sigil may be burnt, buried, or cast into an ocean. It is possi-ble to lose a word spell by constant repetition as this eventually empties themind of associated desire. The sigil is charged at moments when the mindhas achieved quiescence through magical trance, or when high emotional-ity paralyzes its normal functioning. At these times the sigil is concentratedupon, either as a mental image, or mantra, or as a drawn form. Some of thetimes when sigils may be charged are as follows: during magical trance; atthe moment of orgasm or great elation; at times of great fear, anger, orembarrassment; or at times when intense frustration or disappointmentarises. Alternatively, when another strong desire arises, this desire is sacri-ficed (forgotten) and the sigil is concentrated on instead. After holding thesigil in the mind for as long as possible, it is wise to banish it by evokinglaughter.A record should be kept of all work with sigils but not in such away as to cause conscious deliberation over the sigilized desire.22"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"DREAMINGThe dream state provides a convenient egress into the fields of divination,entities and exteriorization or “out of the body” experience. All humansdream each night of their lives, but few can regularly recount their experi-ences even a few minutes after waking. Dream experiences are so incon-gruous that the brain learns to prevent them interfering with waking con-sciousness. The magician aims to gain full access to the dream plane and toassume control of it. The attempt to do this invariably involves the magi-cian in a deadly and bizarre battle with his own psychic censor, which willuse almost any tactics to deny him these experiences.The only method of gaining full access to the dream plane is to keepa book and writing instrument next to the place of sleeping at all times. Inthis, record the details of all dreams as soon as possible after waking.To assume conscious control over the dream state, it is necessary toselect a topic for dreaming. The magician should start with simple experi-ences, such as the desire to see a particular object (real or imaginary) andmaster this before attempting divination or exteriorization. The dream isset up by strongly visualizing the desired topic in an otherwise silencedmind, immediately before sleep. For more complex experiences the methodof sigils may be employed.A record of dreams is best kept separate from the magical record asit tends to become voluminous. However any significant success should betransferred into the magical diary.Though one may get to fear the sight of it, a properly keptmagical record is the surest guarantor of success in the work of LiberMMM: it is both a work of reference with which to evaluate progressand, most significantly, a goad to further effort.23"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"Liber MMM© 1987 Peter J.
