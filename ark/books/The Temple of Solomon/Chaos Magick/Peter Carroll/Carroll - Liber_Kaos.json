The prob-lem is rar from being an abstract conundrum lim· ited to the realms o f submicroscopic particle physics. All phenomena have a wave function. and such functions affect any fairly complex event on the macroscopic scale as well, as the section on Chaos Mathematics will show. The CMT (Chaos Magic Theory) paradigm states that the wave functions are actually a mathematical description of etheric patterns and that this ether can be c onsidered as a form of information exchange between material events operating over the minimum quantum of time, the Planc k time, and furthermore that the etheric dimension should be considered as somehow or· thogonal to the ordinary ( pseudo) time dimen-sion of classical relativistic descriptions. This is represented graphically in figure I . Thus quantum wave functions do not directly describe the actual behavior of classical relativis-tic mechanical events.

If , as many th eo· rists suspect. there is sufficient mass in the uni-verse, it should eventually collapse bac k into a ~big crunch,~ II scenario in which all space, time, mass, and energy will disappear-possibly in preparation for another big bang. This, however, is uncertain, for the physics which predicts such singularities completel y breaks down the singularities themselves. Nevertheless, when classical relativistic calculations lire applied to measurements of the large-scale appearance of this universe, it seems that jf the mass is as large as is suspected, then both space and time are"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"PRINCIPIA MAGICA' 9 finite and bounded, which means that there is only a certain amount of each available and that they have a definite beginning and end: although they may be able to start again after some unim-aginable catastrophe. A quantum description would locate the o ri-gin of the universe in a vacuum fluctuation. It is possible for particles to appear spontaneously from the void, if certain criteria are obeyed. In particu-lar, the bigger the mass and the energy of the particle, the smaller must be the time for which it can exist, and hence the space it can traverse. Very small particles can be observed popping out of the void and disappearing again quite easily. The phenomenization of an entire universe out of the void by a vacuum fluctuation must be an exceedingly remote event, but its probability of occurrence is non-zero. Now. the equtltlons which govern the spontaneous manifestation of the uni-verse from the void are: 6.E°6.T_ h and 8M ° .'!.e - h where dE, 6.T, tJw\\ and 6.C represent the allowable energy, time. mass and light-speed respectively, and h represents Planck's Constant, a very small number.

The mass and energy of the universe must be ex-ceedingly close to zero. if time and light-speed,"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"10 . USER KAOS and hence size. are to match the observable val-ues. However, the apparently vast energy of this universe has two components; kinetic and poten-tial, represented by the motion of the galaxies and the gravitational energies pulling them back. These must CZlncel to zero if the universe is closed in space and time. Similarly, the two components of mass, the inertial and gravitational, must also cancel to zero. Thus there is no real connict with observed or potentially observable vl!ilues. The quantum de-scription, however. paInts ZI radically different picture of this universe in other respects. Quan· tum theory describes probabilistic wave functions. rather than the deterministic particle behaviors of the classical relativistic description. Thus. if an attempt is made to extrapolate backwards, using quantum formulae, to the supposed epoch of the big bang, it has an equal probability of having occurred at every point in space-time. Thus all possible points in space-time in the quantum de-scription will have. from the point of view of o b · servers at these points, identical amounts of space, time, mass and energy Zlvallable. At all points, the overall temperature of this universe will ap· pear to be the same, as the mass/ energy ratio remains constant-and observers at all points of space· time will observe sim ilar galactic red shifts and hubble constants, reflecting a uniform space-time curvature."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"PRINCIPIAMAGICA ·11 Table 1 Relativ istic and Quantum Universes • • Rt'latl~iS!ic Qu.Jntum \"\"\"» : H\"IIt' o IGf.J\"\"t~tlOO.O! cancf'ls Inertial) Enef!lY: H\"ge o IKinetic (jIl>Cel) POH.>nti.Jl) $p.lr(,: f , nilf' ann Bou>\"l/\"k)d fInite but Unbounded Time: FinIte and I:Ioufl(\\(>d FInite but Unbounded SlnsUlaflll~· 2 ~t INS! 0 In the quantum description. space and time are finite but unbounded and the singularities pre-dicted by classical relativistic theory disappear as mere artifacts of that theory.

Ll8ER KAO S QUANTUM METAPHYSICS Two of the three known mllglcal phitosophies, Animism and Spiritism. lire very ancient, and vllrious admixtures of them make up the Sha-manism of pre-pllglln cultures. The third philoso-phy, Chaos Magic Theory (CMT), is now embry-onic and it Is the first felll alternative to have developed since shamanlc times. All the magical philosophies which have lIccreted in the interven-ing period are merely resUltements of, or extrapo-lations from, the animist Of spiritist parlldigms. To illustrate the differences between these sys-tems, each will be considered in some detail. Ani-mism is based on the theory or observation that all phenomenll---i\"lot Just plllnts lind lInimlils are IInimate or alive in some sense. The IInimist ma-gicilln attempts to work with the vital principle in every phenomenon. This vital principle, or -mana,M as it is known in parts of Oceana. represents both the power and the quality of II phenomenon. be It a human, animal, plant, stone, o r other natural object or event. As mana is directly transferable between pheno ••• ena, animist magicians may caiT)' or ingest certain things to add their powers and qUlllities to their own_ Alternatively they may seek to absorb th e qualities of the mana in such things to give divinatory knowledge. In many animist systems, the powers and qualities of mana lire also trans-ferrable by imaginative visualization, or by some"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"PRIN(IPIAMAGICA ·19 form of ritual enchantment by which the mana from some phenomenon can be used in the ab-sence of the phenomenon itself. Alternatively, a mere part of the phenomenon, or something once part of it, can be used; for example, the claws of an eagle or someone's personal possessions. In some animist systems, mana is simply a property of any phenomenon, like its weight or volume. It is not antecedent to the phenomenon and neither does it survive its destruction. In other systems, mana is thought to precede the physical form and is considered to be the cause of its existence. This leads to more complex theories about the origin of mana itself and the survival of mana from things which have ceased to exist. Thus it can be seen that the more complex theories of ani-mism begin to shade into spiritism. In full-blown spiritism, all things in the world are further endowed with a degree of sentience. They are considered to have a spirit capable of thought, memory, and emotion, and thus to be responsive to petition, bargaining, argument, and even threats. Such activities make up the bulk of spiritist magical practice. Spiritism can be seen as a projection of human psychology onto all phenomena of the world in an attempt to control or communicate with them.

Recently it has proved possible to integrate ele-ments of both these paradigms with new scien· tific and psychological discoveries to create something altogether simpler. more powerful and elegant called Chaos Magic Theory. or CMT for short. In order to explain CMT it is necessary to introduce a concept which can be dignified with the old name -Ether.-It is no more possible to say what ether actually is than it is possible to say what matter and energy actually are. All we can do is describe its behavior o r say what it does. Ether acts as though it were a form of infor-mation emitted by matter that is instantaneously available everywhere and has some power to shape the behavior of other matter. It appears to be broadly analogous to what have been called morphogenetic fields or non-local effects in phys-ics. Now it should be remembered that ether is a purely desc riptive hypothesis. Within the CMT paradigm, reality can be described as though it had the properties we can attribute to ether. much as within the paradigm of physics the universe can be described as having the properties we at-tribute to energy. Neither of these concepts should be regarded as other than merely convenient de-scriptions of our experiences and observations. Magicians and scientists should never attribute absolute reality to anything."},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"n . LIB[R kAO~ CMT is presently a qualitative description. al-though its practical formulae for simple magics are quantitative. However, CMT is potentially quantifiable. and its quantification, if achieved. could represent that unification of magic and sci-ence necessary for a complete description of this reality. The first principle of CMT is that all matter emits ether and that this ether carries, or consists of, information about the matter which emitted it. The second principle is thet this ether is non-local in space. It is instantaneously available ev-erywhere. The third principle Is that ether has a shaping effect on the behavior of metter, having affinity or similarity with the matter which emitted it, tend-ing t o make the behevior of the two more similar. Now ether cannot be detected except when it ex-erts this effect. much es grevltatlon can only be detected between bodies and light can only be detected by absorbing it. It Is the coupling be-tween matter and ether that gives rise to the so-called physical laws and physical constants of the universe. These arise on a purely chaotic and arbitrary basis but become more reliable and uni· form through repetition. The coupling remains probabilistic, although meny of the simpler me-chanical events have an overwhelming probabil-ity of conformIng to type. Yet any novel event is c haotic although pattem-formlng."},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"PRINCIPIA MAGICA' 23 The fourth principle is that ether also couples with itself to create etheric patterns correspond-ing to the possible past and futures of .!Iny mo-ment. These patterns do not completely deter-mine the future (or the past). for their coupling with matter is probabilistic and only one of the possible patterns will manifest as the actual future state of the system. Thus the behavior of matter. particularly in complex systems, remains partly chaotic or indeterminate. We should no t fflll into the trap created by memory and expectation of supposing that the physical past and future have any real existence. Only the present moment ac-tually exists. and every moment of the present h.!ls its own unique pattern of past and future. The often unrecognized problem here Is that the initial conditions of an indeterminate event cannot be recovered after it has occurred. We must therefore admit any and all initial conditions which might have led to the observed result, al -though our common sense strives to create an illusory certainty about the causes of events by imputing reverse causal connections. History is butlshit; it is flS indeterminate as the future. The fifth principle is that mental events, be-ing materifll structures, are capllble o f emitting and coupling with ether. Thus. for eX.!lmple, un-der the right conditions, a thought or visu.!llization of some phenomenon can create an etheric pllttem which couples with that phenomenon to modify"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"24 . U BER KAO$ Its behavior. Conversely. the ether from some phenomenon can couple with a mental image of that phen omenon and modify it to provide divinatory information. These five principles constitute the minimum hypothesis required to describe both the ubiquity of the physical laws of the universe and their ap-parent occasional violation by c haotic and magi-cal events. At the same time the five principles imply a realistic limitation on the power and vari-ety of esoteric effects. while confirming that the universe itself is a magical phenoffi@non. Telepa-thy. for example, occurs because of the same mechanism which keeps the speed of light at a particular constant value. Telepathic coupling is less reliable only because there are more differ-ences between two mental events than there are between any two photon quanta. The third principle presumes the old magical idea of like affects like. Only between those phe-nomena or mental events having considerable similarity can a magical link operate. The fourth principle describes enchantment readily enough.

However. CMT asserts that the opposite effect, namely retroactive enchant-ment, is possible. In fact, many of the bizarre and anomalous results recorded in the annals of magic can only have been due to retroactive enchant-ment. In practice what happens is that a spell is cast and some time later a result is recorded whkh strongly implies that an alteration has occurred to events that probably occurred prior to the spell being cast. Once it is remembered that the past and fu-ture in ordinary pseudo time do not exist except in terms of memory and expectation. then the conceptual difficulties with retroactive enchant-ment disappear. In retroactive enchantment an act of magic alters the probability structure of the ether pattems in the past shadow time of a par-ticular ordinary pseudo time moment. This can result in a subsequent moment of ordinary pseudo time exhibiting a present real state and shadow time future. which may also manifest physically later, which is other than might have been ex-pected.

More complex acts of magic suc h as evocation, invocation, and illumination are not readily described by these ~uations except where the stated intent of such acts can be reduced to fairly simple objectives corresponding to divination and enchantment. The main use of the equations is in the planning of TrnIgical acts, for they indicate the precise requirements for any required degree of probability manipulatlon. The quantification of c ertain factors which are entered in the equatio ns awaits more precise callbration techniques and thus they must currently be evaluated on a partly subjective bosis. However the mathematics are completely rigorous and the equations are a use-ful indicatio n of what one needs to be put into a magical act and what is likely to come out as II result. The effectiveness of a magical act depends on two main factors, denoted P, the probability of the desired effect occurring by chance, lind M . the magiC factor. The probability P of any event occurring by chance must lie somewhere between zero, impossibility, and one, certainty. In the Cllse of divinatory magic, the possibillty P represents the probability of guessing the correct answer by chance.

In the meantime an analysis of the radically differing concepts of time and self in each paradigm is offered to more fully distinguish the basic Ideas. Transcendentalists conceive of time in millennial and apocalyptic terms. Time is regarded as having a definite beginning and ending, both initiated by the activitlM of spiritual beings or forces. The end of time on the personal and cos-mic scale is regarded not so much as a cessation of being but as a c hange to a state of non-mate-rial being. The beginning of personal and cosmic time is similarly Teg8rded 8S a cre8tive 8ct by spiritual agencies.

Thus it is suddenly revealed that the final days are at hand, or that some earthly d ispute is in fact a titanic battle against evil spiri-tual agencies. Materialist time is linear but unbounded. Ide-ally it can be extended arbitrarily far in either direction from the present. To the strict material-ist it is self-evidently futile to speculate about a beginning o r an end to time. Similarly the materi-alist is contemptuous of any speculations about any forms of personal existence before birth or after death. The materialist may well fear painful or premature death but can have no fears about being dead. The magical view is that time is cyclic and that all processes recur. Even cycles which ap-pear to begin or end are actually parts of larger cycles. Thus all endings are beginnings. and the end of time is synonymous with the beginning o f time in another universe.

On the other hand, they have to be released o r activated somehow at a level just below conscious awareness, for in their normal memory storage mode, which is an abstract code, they are not magically effective either. Thus magicians have to occupy their con-scious minds with something that somehow acti-vates intent in their subconscious without con-sciously reminding them of what it is, This is basic sleight of mind. Though this might seem para-doxical or impossible, there are many tricks in the lore of magic which make it easier in prac-tice. Some consideration will be given to sleight of mind in each of the five classical magical op-erations. SLEIGHT OF MIND IN ENCHANTMENT Most traditional magical spells demand that the operator confine attention to some abstract or analogical representation of what one wants to achieve. For example, to cause dissention among one's foes, one might name a number of stones with their names, or better stili some abstract form of their names, and then while hysterically angry, batter the stones together. The hysterical anger functions partly to block conscious thought and partly to add force to the subconscious desire. What many conventional texts rail to mention is"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"S LEIGHT OF MIND· 89 that during the magical act one must avoid con-sciously thinking or fantasizing about the desired result. Thus the anger should be stimulated by some means other than thinking of one's foes, and if one wishes to shout something out during the battering of the stones it should be a con-sciously unintelligible statement. Even the desire read backwards may suffice. It is possible to use an inhibitory rather than an ecstatic means of preventing th ought and channelling power to the subconscious. In this case the magician attempts to limit conscious attention entirely to the perfor-mance of the enchantment by yoga-type exer-cises and sensory deprivation to still the mind. This is usually a more difficult approach to en-chantment for most magicians. If. in the above example, the battered stones are subsequently placed in a pouch as a talisman to reinforce the original spell, then the magician must also avoid consciously thinking about what-ever it represents whenever subsequently at-tempting to charge it again. All the spells which work are variants of this basic technique and work by the same basic mechanism. Baroque systems of symbol and cor-respondence are generally unnecessary.

The principle here is that minute movements initiated by the subconscious will provide a mechanism by whi<:h the subconscious can communicate Its psychic knowledge. Halluci-n/!ltory methods work in a similar fashion; the op-erator will gaze for 6ample into a black mirror or a chalice of water and wait for the subconscious t o reveal its psychic knowledge by optical hallu-cination.

One ef-fective hallucinatory technique is to write the name of the target. or better still draw an abstract sigil representing it, on the back of a black mirror, Any visions experienced while gazing blankly into it sho uld be recorded by a machine o r scribe. The interpretation can then safely be made in full con · scious awareness afterwards, much as a spell is deliber!!tely planned beforehand.

The final madness begins when one starts Interpreting even the disasters which befall as expressions of what one must re-ally have wanted. Paranoia can also become a vicious downward spiral. Those who harbor sub-conscious fears of things going wrong, o r going against them, will find it remarkably easy to actu-ally make things go badly for themselves with even a small degree of expertise at sleight of mind. The only defense against these pitfi!llls is to adhere to the formal techniques of enchantment and divination, to ignore random results where possible, o r to i!lccept them with laughter, i!lnd as a general principle to think positively at all times, for such thoughts will permeate down to the sub-conscious.

The implantation can be effected either by an extended effort of fantasy and imagination, o r by a more formal ritual in which the entity is visualized exercising the general types of power which the magician wishes it to have. The empowerment, which can form the climax to a ritual, consists of confining one's attention to the material basis of the entity, o r some sigil, mantra, glyph, or other abstract or analogical representation of it, while in full gnosis, Sexual gnosis, often used here as the symbolism of creating a being, albeit a non-material one, is particularly appropriate: although, for reasons to be discussed in the Sex Magic section, it is gen-erally unwise to empower entities with destructive capabilities in this manner.

Basiclilly two forms of subconscious lIctivity have to be brought into play simultaneously for a successful invocation. The emotions must be se-lectively aroused to add power. This often begins consciously by an effort of deliberate simulation during the conscious identification phase and then forms a vital part of the gnosis phase, but it must develop its own momentum during the posses-sion phase when the conscious lets the subcon-scious take over. The other subconscious faculty required appears to be located in the normally rather quiet right cerebral hemisphere. This must be induced to channel up the genius of whatever Is invoked and to give it form and expression.

One of the most im-portant sleight of mind tricks in invocation hinges on the c urio us relationship of ritual to belief. My fellow humans, it is m y unfortunate duty to point out that we have a greater propensity to believe what we do, than to do what we believe. All phi-losophy is biography; force someone to perform military o r religious rituals and they will come to believe that they are a S<Hdier or a religious devo-tee. Our beliefs lire largely fOililed by what we find ourselves doing. The magician, however, exploits thIs mecha· nism. You start with an idea of what you want to believe. and then select a ritual and III god-form in which you act as though such beliefs are true. By performing them. you alter your belief deliber-ately. Perhaps it would be better to say that you provide yourself with a range of beliefs which can be invoked selectJvely to enable yourself as cir -cumstances demand.

Otherwise you face a long-term nar-rowing of your humanity, which may well prove effective in the short term, but which leads inexo-rably to sterility and failure. The magician should also be aware of god-forms that begin to exceed the purposes for which they were invoked . I be-lieve there are mllny selves within us; that we are all cases of multiple personality-though generally unafflicted with the amnesia which is the haJJ-mark of clinical manifestations o f this condition. Sanity is a state in which our component selves love and trust each other and are prepared to let each other assume control as circumstances de-mand. If a particular self, enhanced by invoclltion, begins to seriously encroach on the functions of the other selves, it is a sign that something is going wrong; the basic self-love that binds the selves together is breaking down and demons will lIrise as a result.

However it has rarely proved possible to implant this belief deeply enough to ensure that such flights were not of exceedingly short duration! Neverthe-less such feats as fire-walking and obliviousness to extreme pain are sometimes achieved by this mechanism.

To fa cilitate this projection or reception of information, various bodily actio ns such as movements, gestures, sounds, visualizations and simulati ons of senSl.ltlon are used in th e same way as sigils, to stimulate subconscious intent. There are a number of reaso ns why auric magic has come to be false ly considered quite distinct from other forms of magic and to operate through a different mechanism. Firstly, because o f its development in esoteric martial arts and medicine. it has come to be regarded as a short-range effect associltted with force and vitality. The availability of the contemporary analogies of force or energy fields hits also encouraged a hardening of this view. Secondly, auric magic often achieves results which are more impressive o r repeatable than ord inary enchantment lit a distance, but this is usually due to the magical link being better at point blank range."},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"AURIC MAGIC' 103 Some practitioners of auric magic prefer to imagine their art to be dependent on some kind of force. and such conceptualizations will natu-rally encourtlge the manifestation of effects which mimic what might be expected of some extraor-dinarily obliging form of force. However the force or energy model has two severe drawbacks. It imposes an unnecessary limitation on wh<!lt can be attempted, and it encourages ineffective meth-ods of attempting such magic. For example, not only is it possible to break an object without physical contact, it is also possible to break an object whose loc<!ltion is unknown to you. In nei-ther case is it helpful to imagine some kind of ectopl8smic force being extruded from one's body to cre8te the effect.

Traditionally conceived of as a black-robed skeletal figure armed with a scythe, the death-self is privy to the mysteries of aging, senescence, morbidity, ne-crosis, entropy, and decay. It is often also pos-sessed of a wry and world-weary sense of humor. Surrounded with all the symbols and para-phernalia of death, the magician invokes the death-self in a Chod rite for one of two purposes. Firstly, the experience of the death-self and the black gnosis brings the knowledge of what it feels like to begin dying, and thus prepares the magi-cian to resist the manifestations of actual prema-ture death by, as it were, knowing the enemy. A demon is just a god acting out of turn. In the course of various Chod rites the magician may well experiment in shamanic style by invoking the visualized entities and symbols that are asso-ciated with various diseases, to practice banishing them.

The supreme advantage of such attacks is that they are rarely perceived as such by the targets who have noth-ing but themselves and blind chance to blame fo r the disasters which befall them.

Money is an abstract concept used to quantify economic activity, thus wealth is a mea-sure of how well you control your experiences with money. Assuming that varied, exciting, un-usual and stimulating experiences are preferable to dull ones, and that they tend to be expensive for this reason, then the main problem for most people is to find a highly efficient form of money input which has the above agreeable qualities.

In a suitable environment it will even re-produce itself. The nature of the money spirit is movement; money likes to move. If it is hoarded and not used, it slowly dies. Money thus prefers to manifest as tumover rather than as unexploited assets.

The popularity of tales about the misery and misfortunes of the rich is testimony to the ridiculous myth prevalent among the poor that the rich are unhappy. Before begin-ning works of blue magic, it is essential to seriously examine all negative thoughts and feelings about money and to exorcise them.

Hymns and incantations to money can be deliv-ered. Checks for startling sums can be written to yourself and desires can be proclaimed and visu-alized.

Thus, assuming there is sufficient parity of force to make a fight seem worthwhile to both parties, morale is the decisive factor in con-flict.

Fourth, the urge to assertion and dominance. All these things are manifestations of the same yellow power; although their relative emphasis varies greatly between individuals. Success in most human societies usually re-sults from a skillful expression of the yellow power.

Only those who re-alize that they own a personality, rather than con-sist of a personality, can modify it. For most people, a preparation of a detailed inventory of their own personality is a very difficult and unset-tling activity. Yet once it is done, it is usually quite easy to decide what changes are desirable. Changes to the ego or self-image or person-ality by magic are classed as works of illumina-tion and are mainly accomplished by retroactive enchantment and invocation. Retroactive en-chantment in this case consists of rewriting our personal history. As our history largely defines our future, we can change our future by redefining our past. Everybody has some capacity to reinterpret things which were considered to have gone wrong in the past in a more favorable light, but most fail to pursue the process to the full. We cannot eliminate disabling memories, but by an effort of visualization and imagination we can write in parallel, enabling memories of what might also have happened, to neutralize the originals. We can also, where possible, modify any remammg physical evidence that favors the disabling memory.

An unreciprocated friendship is a disability only to the person offering it.

PURPLE MAGIC A large proportion of all the cults throughout his-tory have shared one particular characteristic. They have been led by a charismatic man able to persuade women to freely dispense sexual favors to other men. When one begins to look, this fea-ture is startlingly common to many ancient cults, monotheistic schismatic sects, and modern eso-teric groups. Many, if not the majority, of adepts past and present were, or are, whoremasters. The mechanism is quite simple; pay the women in the coinage of spirituality to service the men who repay you with adulation and accept your teach-ings as a side-effect. The adulation from the men then increases your charisma with the women creating a positive feedback loop. It can be a nice little earner until old age or a police raid catches up with the enterprise.

The turn-over in such cults can thus be high, with young adults constantly replacing those approaching early middle age. Few religions or cults lack a sexual teaching, for any teaching provides a powerful level of con-trol. The vast majority of the more durable and established religions trade on a suppression of so-called free love. This pays considerable divi-dends, too. Women's positions become more se-cure, and men know who their children are. Natu-rally adultery and prostitution flourish in such conditions because some people always want a little more than lifelong monogamy has to offer. So it's quite true that brothels are built with the bricks of religion. Indirectly so with conventional religions, directly so with many cults. All this begs the question of why it is that people have such an appetite for wanting to be told what to do with their sexuality. Why do people have to seek esoteric and metaphysical justifica-tion for what they want to do? Why is it so easy to make a living selling water by the river?

Few people manage to achieve greatness in any field without the propulsion that a turbulent emotional-sexual life supplies. This is the major secret of sex magic, the two minor secrets involve the function of orgasm as gnosis and the projection of sexual glamors. Anything held in the conscious mind at or-gasm tends to reach down into the subconscious. Sexual abnormalities can readily be implanted or removed by this method. At orgasm sigils for en-chantment or evocation can be empowered either by visualization or by gazing at the sigil taped to your partner's forehead, for example. However this kind of work is often more conveniently per-formed auto-erotically. Although the gnosis of-fered by orgasm can in theory be used in support of any magical objective, it is generally unwise to use it for entropy or combat magic. No spell is ever totally insulated within the subconscious, and any leakages which occur can implant quite det-rimental associations with the sexuality.

The projection of sexual glamor for the pur-poses of attracting others depends on far more than simple physical appearance. Some of the most conventionally pretty people lack it entirely, whlle some of the plainest enjoy its benefits to the limit. To be attractive to another person you must offer something that is a reflection of part of themselves. If the offer becomes reciprocal, then it can lead to that sense of completion which is most readily celebrated by physical intimacy. In most cultures it is conventional for the male to display a tough public exterior and for the female to display a softer persona, yet in a sexual en-counter each will seek to reveal their concealed factors. The male will seek to show that he can be compassionate and vulnerable as well as pow-erful, while the female seeks to display inner strength behind the outward signs and signals of passive receptivity. Incomplete personalities such as those which are machismo to the core, or con-sist of the polar opposite of this, are never sexu-ally attractive to anyone except in the most tran-sient sense. Thus the philosophers of love have come to identify a certain androgyny in either sex as an important component of attraction.

This reflects the truism that to be attractive to others you must first become at · tracted to yourself. A few hours spent praCticing being attractive in front of a m irror is a valuable exercise. If you cannot get even mildly excited about yourself, then don't expect anyone else to get wildly exci ted. The Moon Glance technique is often effec-tive. Basically you briefly close your eyes. Mo· mentarily visualize a lunar crescent in silver behind your eyes-with the horns of the Moon project ing out of each side of your head behind your eyes. Then glance into the eyes of a potential lover whil e visualizing a sliver radiance beaming from your eyes to his or hers. This maneuver also has the effect of dilating the pupils and usually ceuses an involuntary smile. Both of these are universal sexual signals, the first of which acts subcon-sciously. It is generally unwise to cast spells for the attraction of spe<::ific partners. It is better to con -jure for suitable partners in general for yourself or others. Your subconscious usuelly has a far more subtle appreciation of who really Is suitable. Sexual magic is traditionally associated with the colors of purple ( for passion) and silver (for the Moon).

Black-yellow invocations are conventionally performed in two halves as death-rebirth experiences in which the magician seeks to substantially re -create the self image following its ritual sacrifice.

You might, for example, after some careful background research, depart in disguise to some strange place and play out a completely new social role. Alternatively, you may wish to equip your temple and yourself in such a way that you experience being an ancient Egyptian god for a time.

However, the traditional term \"vision quest\" should be understood to include a quest for an answer sensed in any way, be it hallucinatory voices, tactile sensation or whatever. In general, you, the magician, concentrate on the question you wish to put as you enter your state of dream, half-sleep, or trance and then allow a flow of images, voices or other sensations to arise within yourself. A completely free-form vision can be attempted and later interpreted, or the magician may attempt to structure experience by looking for special symbols, particularly those chosen for the sorcery divination work.

In general these distractions should be banished by greater concentration on the desired visualization. However, if they are per-sistent, they may reveal some knowledge about the target or your relationship to it which you can use to improve your enchantment. For example, if a target person repeatedly appears to have some kind of aura or animal form in a vision, it is often best to work your visualization directly upon this. Similarly, if a target situation seems to have some kind of characteristic vibration or \"feel\" about it in the spirit vision, then you will often succeed by working magic upon a visualization of this rather than of the actual substance of the situation. CONJURATION NINE-SHAMANIC INVOCATION In shamanic invocation, the magiCian draws knowledge and power from atavisms, normally animal atavisms.

Before the divination, the ma-gician should ritually charge the divinatory instru-ment with a sigil or analogical representation of the question. The divinatory selection is then made under gnosis.

TH E MAGICAL PACT OF THE ILLUMINATES OF THANATEROS Since the inception of the Chaos Magic current some individuals have elected to work alone while others have worked in concert, in a loose con-figuration of allied groups. The Magical Order of the lOT has in practice functioned as a highly creative disorder. This creative disorder has spawned, among other things, a structure known as The Pact. The Pact is, in contradistinction to the usual implications of such a name, a friendly society for mutual support and encouragement in the field of magic. The Magical Pact of the lOT represents another phase of the current of Chaos Magic in which its practitioners elect to work as an integrated force. The Pact is a vehicle for the pursuit of the Great Work of Magic and the plea-sures and profits attendant upon this quest. The Pact also acts as a psychohistoric force in the battle for the aeon.

Yet, positions of mas-tery within these: organiU!ltions have often de-pended more on questionable claims to authority from concealed sources than from technic al ac-complishments. Inevitably, the calling of such bluffs has led to the undoing of these organizations. Ho wever, this old mechanism Is not without its merits. The Guru and Chela put eac h other under enormous pressure, and if the Chela finally rebels both may gain greatly, although it can as easily end in d isaster. Now, whereas most individuals are relatively sane and competent, most o rganizations act as though mad and stupid, because most o rganiza-tio ns permit only positive feedbac k from below. Those at the top are condemned to bask in de-ceitful renections of their own expectations and to issue ever more inappropriate directives. The structure of The Pact overcomes these: traditional problems while retaining the invaluable pressure c reated by a hierarchical structure. Within the temples of The Pact, all members are encour-aged to volunteer techniques and concepts for experiment lind appraiSllI. and the grade struc-ture merely recognizes technical magical compe-tence o!Ind organizational responsibility.

The records detail the time and place of temple activi-ties, together with a brief description of whatever work was done and what results were achieved.

The Neophyte grade provides a period of as· sessment during which The Pact and the Neo· phyte test their commitment to each other.

This may be presented in the form of a banner or altar cloth, a chaosphere, or by the star mounted on a staff. All grades wear plain full robes with sleeves and hoods. The robe is most commonly black, but individual temples may elect to array their members in robes of some other hue. The ring of the order is silver and bears an eight-rayed star of Chaos. It may be worn freely at any time but is not in itself proof of membership or grade.
