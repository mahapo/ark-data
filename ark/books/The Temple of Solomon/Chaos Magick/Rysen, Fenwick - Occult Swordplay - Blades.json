To his magickallyattuned eyes, the runes he had etched into the blade glowed red—blood red, the same scarlet brilliance with which he hadempowered them. The red glow spread to consume the blade, lanced through with the blacks and whites and greys of theprimal chaos. The master, skilled against the relative fumblings of his student, suddenly found himself retreating beforethe onslaught of the sword as it took over, its aura spreading through Michael’s body, filling him with newfound strength,controlling his strikes and parries with almost inhuman skill.From the vorpal sword that dispatched the Jaberwock with a snicker snak to the legendary powers of the other-worldly Excalibur, our myths and legends are filled with stories about magic swords and their wondrous abilities. Somuch so has the concept of a magic sword enamored us that it penetrates our entire fantasy genre from books togames to movies to children’s action figures. These swords make their wielders larger than life, able to fightagainst incredible odds, the sword granting them powers beyond human reckoning.Such stories are often dismissed as pure fancy, but behind them lies a certain amount of truth. Most aspiring occultswordsmen will be able to cast minor magicks upon their swords to aid them in combat, but rare is the magicianwho can empower a sword to possess its wielder or to drain its foe of his lifeforce. Magick swords are powerfulbecause they grant powers normally reserved for the most skilled and dedicated magician to anyone who canpick up a sword and swing it around, much as a powerful talisman can cause magickal effects for those who wearthem, even if they do not understand or have the capacity to create that talisman themselves. A magic sword islittle more that an elaborately constructed and meticulously enchanted talisman of combat.Some of these techniques are more difficult to create than others, and all of them possess an upper limit definedonly by the ability of the magician enchanting the blade. Creating a magick sword often requires copiousamounts of patience, skill, and luck. Not all magicians will be able to create a powerful magickal artifact likeExcalibur, but even the lowliest magician will find that he is able to enhance a weapon to no small benefit.As with any new magickal skill you aim to add to your repertoire, you will get better at it with the more practiceyou have. Because swords can be expensive, the aspiring enchanter of swords can practice with shinai orbokken. While they are not quite as enamoring to work with, they do have the benefit of being both readilyavailable, and relatively cheap.The powers and possibilities of enchanted swords truly push the limits of what most people accept as achievablethrough magick, which means that while some of the topics can be discussed in detail, their possible limits andapplications far exceed what most people would expect. Keep an open mind, and dedicate much thought tothose aspects of magick swords that you believe to be impossible. You may surprise yourself.Permanent EnchantmentsThis is one of the simplest techniques that a magician can use to create a magick sword, and yields the widestvariety of results, depending on the goal of the magician. Essentially, a permanent enchantment is nothing morethan empowering the sword as you would a talisman or a magickal tool for use in a specific task. Enchantmentscan be combined, adding them to the sword as time goes on. Old enchantments can be renewed, grantingthem more strength over time. Anything that can be done to a talisman can also be done to a sword. Your ownmagickal training and your own experiences in creating talismans or other magickal objects will determine yourtastes, preferences, and limits in this arena.Awakened BladesPerhaps the most common stories of magic swords are those of a blade that possesses an intelligence andcognizance of its own. Like a spirit bound to a talisman, the magician can create an intelligence bound to his"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"blade. This intelligence can be a created spirit, a spirit that the magician captures and binds to the sword, or in amore animistic vein the magician can simply talk to his sword, imbuing it with the power to become intelligent, and“awaken” it that way. Regardless of the method chosen, an awakened blade has many benefits over amundane sword.It’s hard to say exactly what any specific awakened blade will do. As you awaken it or create it, you have fullcontrol over how smart it will be, how it will communicate, what skills it has, and how it will influence its wielder. Anawakened blade will have an aura like any magickally charged object, and the contact the magician has withthe aura, especially during combat as the two auras mingle, allows the sword to influence the magician as muchas the magician influences the sword. It’s a two-way street.Until you have worked with several awakened blades, it is hard to describe just what benefits the sword will giveyou. The wielder of an awakened blade typically seems to move faster and with greater skill than he does with aregular sword. An awakened blade can also learn, and also seems to be able to impart some of its “knowledge”of fighting to the person who uses it over time. Perhaps most significantly, the most advanced awakened bladesact as a powerful spirit bound to the sword, capable of carrying out very complicated magickal tasks at yourcommand, or acting as a guardian spirit that warns you of danger.Your own views about spirits, aethyric intelligences, enchanted objects, and your personal view of what anawakened blade “should” or “shouldn’t” be will all shape how you create and interact with one. The only way totruly learn the benefits of awakened blades is to create one—and after you do, you will probably never want touse a regular sword again.Be warned here—if you practice solely with an enchanted blade (awakened or not) you may begin to rely toomuch on it, and in that critical combat situation when you lose your sword and must take up another blade thatisn’t enchanted, you’ll be in real trouble. By all means, practice with enchanted blades, but don’t make a habit ofit. Reserve them for those situations where you truly need them.Always practice creating enchanted blades with your bokken or shinai. They are relatively cheap and just as easyto awaken as a steel blade, allowing you to practice at different techniques and ideas to see what does anddoesn’t work before you attempt to awaken a blade you value. While the process of awakening a blade can bereversed, it is neither easy nor fun. Sentient creatures, physical or aethyric, will put up an incredible fight when theirlife is threatened—that peaceful little bunny rabbit you thought would be so easy to put down suddenly revealsthat it, too, has a mean bite and rather nasty claws.Power SymbolsWhat each magician considers to be a “power symbol” will vary from person to person. They can be all-encompassing symbols such as the pentagram or very specific symbols such as the planetary glyphs. Magickalalphabets are another great source of power symbols, as are sigils of various sorts. Just as a magician wouldoftentimes use power symbols on a talisman that he has created, so too can he use them to impart desired forcesto his sword.Historically, it was not uncommon for Vikings to have the entirety of the runic alphabet engraved upon their blade,their belief being that a sword thus marked was imbued with the powers of every rune, the totality of whichrepresented every force in the universe.Marking a shinai is as simple as sanding off the slight varnish, marking the bamboo with a felt-tip marker, and thenpouring some varnish on a cotton rag and wiping this over the sanded area once the symbol has dried. Topermanently mark a sword will require that you etch the metal with acid; anyone so inclined would be well advisedto read up on metal arts beforehand, or to seek the advice of someone knowledgeable in such skills.What symbols you choose (if you choose any at all) and how you utilize them are personal choices that will reflectyour individual magickal path. How they work and what they do is left as a choice to the skilled magician whoenchants the blade.Blood MagickThat swords are tied to blood should be no surprise. This makes them a wonderful item to use if you are fond ofblood magick. How you choose to combine blood magick with your swordplay or enchantments is, once again,only a choice that you can make.It is not uncommon to blood a newly forged blade (indeed, some stories tell of powerful swords made by their finalquenching being made not in water, but by running them through the chest of a hapless slave.) It is also common"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"to blood a freshly enchanted blade, running the blood over the blade itself, or over any new engravings orfeatures. Some blades supposedly react to contact with their enemies blood, drawing power from it to transfer totheir wielder (see the next section on Vampiric Blades).While you can draw blood to enchant shinai or other blunt practice instruments or weapons, it is probably bestwhen enchanting a real sword to use the edge of that blade itself.Let your mind be the limit. There is much in the concept of blood magick to explore and apply.Vampiric BladesA sword can also be enchanted so that it acts in a vampiric manner to draw off energy from its victim. With thecompletion of a successful attack, the blade, either through the use of its intelligence (if it has been awakened) orthrough the use of permanent enchantments, can be made to use that wound as a magickal link from which itdraws power. Another type of vampiric enchantment simply relies on contact with the aura of the victim (oftenusing the aura of the enemy blade as a contact point) to draw off energy, much as do human psychic vampires.What the sword then does with the energy leaves much choice. The energy can be used to empower othermagickal effects, to fuel power symbols or permanent enchantments, and can even be used to give power to thewielder—though unless the wielder knows how to process the incoming energy, it can cause disorientation,nausea, and other sundry symptoms that will probably cost you the fight, and may continue to haunt you for sometime to come. Repairing such damage to yourself is often harder than repairing the damage you’ve just causedto the victim.While the morals of this technique are debatable, it is definitely unwise to use this for extended periods of time onfriends and sparring partners that you value, as like any other form of psychic vampirism it can cause permanentor lengthy damage that manifests as depression, apathy, lack of will, and a loss of strength.Unless you have extended experience with the skills of psychic vampirism, or are blessed to be the student of ateacher who can guide you through those skills, it is best to leave psychic vampirism and vampiric blades alone.There is a reason that the legends and myths of such swords are usually tragic stories. A vampiric blade imbuedwith an exceptional intelligence and denied “food” for some amount of time can become as dangerous to theirwielder as to their foe. Be careful.Living SteelPerhaps the most effective way of creating a magickal sword is to forge it yourself. This is a very lengthy andcomplicated affair that will require that you have access to the proper equipment.Modern technology gives us the ability to take a piece of steel bar and essentially carve out the shape we want,allowing much more flexibility on the part of the swordsmith—these methods are faster, more accurate, and (mostimportant to the budding occult swordsmith) easier to learn. However...It has been my experience that swords forged in the old style have an infinite advantage over modern blades inmany areas including strength, flexibility, reliability, and even in their inherent magickal power. There may be abiological reason for this, in that while steel is normally possesses a microscopic crystalline structure, the act ofpounding on it with the hammer and anvil during forging realigns these smaller crystals into larger crystals. Thisprocess of realigning the crystals makes the steel stronger and harder, because the borders between the crystalsthat act as weak points are lessened as the crystals get larger. Blades that have been forged properly begin toapproach the level of being a single crystal of steel, and anyone who has ever held such a blade can tell you thatthere is something special about them. Even those who are not gifted at magick can feel a sort of powerhumming through such a blade. The metal of such a blade is called “living steel”. Many have theorized that thefeeling of power they engender is caused by the human biolelectrical system interacting with the single crystal ofsteel.I know of only one forge in the world that produces swords of living steel, and the price tag often exceeds that ofa small economy car. They are very labor intensive to make, requiring about a month over the forge. The onlyfeasible way that most occult swordsmen will ever possess one is to make it themselves. But before you go to thatmuch trouble, take full advantage of modern methods to practice. You’ll learn a lot about what magicks you canwork into a blade as you shape it from raw steel.Advice for those who would make a living steel sword: Sulfur in the fuel of your forge, in any amount, is your worstenemy, with even the most microscopic amounts rapidly contributing to the brittleness of your steel; if you canafford to use pharmaceutical grade charcoal, this will guarantee you the best result. When heating the metal, use"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"the carbon-rich portion of the flame; over the entire process of forging, this will ensure a soft and flexible steel atthe center (so that the sword will not break) and a hard carbon steel on the outside, which ensures a true edge.There are many other benefits to hand-forged swords, but these two alone are enough to make it worth the effortfor the serious swordsman.Happiness is Twin Enchanted BladesAnother common concept of magick swords are those of twin blades, of two swords somehow bound to eachother. Whether this is because of their similarities, or because they are diametrically opposed to each other, orsimply because the enchanting magician saw fit to work on two blades at once doesn’t matter. You can findmany uses both in your enchantments as well as in actual combat for twin swords.I have found it quite useful to keep a pair of training shinai on hand for the purposes of teaching basic swordplayto new students. One of the swords imparts to its user the ability to observe, comprehend, and integrate thedefensive techniques he is taught, and its twin for the offensive techniques. If the student needs more work withhis defense, I have him practice with the proper sword; if he begins to excel in it and needs more work on hisoffense, I switch his sword. The student almost never realizes the blade is enchanted, and seems to learn fasterthan with an identical shinai that has not been enchanted.Another advantage to twin blades is that by separating dualistic principles, one can build up a charge, so tospeak, between the two blades. This is where the “good sword, evil sword” stories come into play. If I’m trying tomake a “good” sword, you will only be able to go so far as your limits and skills allow you—but many magicians findthat by creating a diametrically opposed blade (in this example, and “evil” sword), they can push those limits,creating a sword that is more “good” than they could have otherwise created. Of course, one need not limithimself to good and evil; any binary force can be used, such as the defensive/offensive training shinai that I use.Paired swords are often stronger than counterparts made individually.Another interesting technique I have experimented with is a Jacob’s Ladder effect when fighting with two swords.A real Jacob’s Ladder is an electrical device consisting of two metal rods across which an electrical current willarc, traveling upward until it ends at the top and a new one forms at the bottom. If you’ve watched any old madscientist movies, you’ve seen them before. The same effect can be achieved when fighting with two swords,using them as rods between which you project an arc of energy. The usefulness of this particular techniquedepends greatly upon your skill in magick. The applications of it are best left to the imagination of the individualmagician.Possession is a Two Way StreetPerhaps the last thing that should be mentioned are blades that possess their owners. In your own practice, youwill probably witness it to at least a small and benign degree with awakened swords that impart abilities to theirwielders. It is not too great a step further for the skilled magician to bind an intelligence to a blade whose purposeis to possess the owner, much as a magician might conjure up a spirit and send it to possess his foe.It has been my experience that most people, on the topic of possession, are quick to judge it as bad, evil, ordestructive, yet I have found possession to be a two-way street. Just as you can imagine a possessing swordcausing its wielder to enter a blood rage where he attacks everything in sight, so too can a sword possess itswielder and create a chivalrous paladin out of him. An infinite array of factors enter into the act of sword-possession, not the least of which include the skill and power of the magician who enchanted the blade, theintelligence of the blade, the personality of the blade, the character and willpower of the wielder, and thesituation in which the sword is employed. Often these factors mean that the possession is only partial; it is very rarefor anyone to become completely possessed by a blade.The wise magician will realize the benefits that possession by a sword can offer. The cunning magician will disguisepossession in such a subtle way that neither friend nor foe will suspect the sword responsible for certain actions.Those magicians who can make reliable blades of this sort are rare indeed. Such swords are inevitably thegreatest find in the occult swordsman’s career—or his worst curse."}]
