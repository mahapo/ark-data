Develop your own SorceryNotesThere is a syllabus of sorts in Liber Null which is worthwhile pursuing, and the Pact offer othercourses, I gather. Don’t forget that the Chaos in Chaos Magick refers to a scientific model which mapsdynamic systems, such as clouds or water, and is not a reference to disorganisation or anarchy! Chaosmagick should be approached from a scientific viewpoint, remember the stages at school; Introduction,Postulate, Experiment, Observation, Results, Theory? However, the freedom comes with not having toadopt a belief system prior to experiment, so you are free to try whatever techniques from whicheversystems you feel attracted to. The downside is why bother? Chaos Magick, like NLP in psychology, isan eclectic bunch of approaches, but has no overarching goal or aim. Initiation and Enlightenment donot feature in its canon aside from as method and side-effect. If you make your goal excellence intechnique, then this is the system for your attitude, if you approach it rigorously.In Real Life ...Here’s a warning from one technique – sigils can be more powerful than they appear, for such an easytechnique. I once cast a sigil for a particular desire, and the object of my desire became an obsession,even when I consciously realised that it was damaging the rest of my life. To this day, twelve yearslater, there is a psychological scar where I removed the sigil by banishing. In NLP, which hassimilarities to Chaos Magick (i.e. dangerous fascination with results over aims) there is a usefultechnique which can mitigate against such problems, called an “environment check.” Before casting asigil, you can use this technique to ensure that the rest of your personality isn’t going to rebel or haveproblems with the particular result being gained. It is quite interesting that what stops us succeeding isoften the fear of success, not failure! Check, in the immortal words of the Spice Girls, that what youwant is what you really really want!Links• Chaos Magick Journal• Phil Hines WebSiteBooks• Liber Null (Carroll, P.)• Prometheus Rising (Wilson, R.
