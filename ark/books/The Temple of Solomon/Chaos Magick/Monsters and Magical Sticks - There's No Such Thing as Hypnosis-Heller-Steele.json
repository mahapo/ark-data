And theweaver would help each person learn how to weave the yarns into beau-tiful tapestries, each with a unique pattern to be used in many differentways.Steve Heller, together with the help of his dear friend and colleagueTerry Steele, has provided readers with a dynamic and brilliant entranceinto a magical world within each of us—a world where it is believed ourtrue abilities, inner learnings, and healing resources reside. Through theuse of humor, metaphor, and enlightening case examples, Heller takes usfar beyond the conscious world of what we \"think\" and \"perceive\" realityto be, and stretches our minds into the dimension known as the uncon-scious. His original, and often provocative, theories and approaches helpshed new light on the classic question confronting many of us: \"Whycan't I overcome my problem when I'm so competent in other areas ofmy life? Why am I continually stuck in this area?\"Heller's views take us into a powerful realm within the unconsciousmind that not only perpetuates the problems, but also contains solutions.It is here that Heller offers the field of psychotherapy a major contribu-tion: his conceptualization of the \"unconscious/out-of-conscious\" sen-sory system finally provides clinicians with a tangible and precise meansof working with the elusive and problematic aspects of unconsciousfunctioning. By creatively evoking, assessing, and utilizing the languageof our sensory systems, Heller is able to identify the out-of-conscioussensory system that is generating the system, pain, or unwanted behavior.He then shows us how he playfully and hypnotically helps clients enterinto their own out-of-conscious sensory systems to bring back into con-scious awareness the innate resources of this pivotal area."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"IOMonsters & Magical SticksThis process facilitates the clients' discoveries of choices in theirlives, and activates their abilities to break unwanted patterns of feelingand behavior.

Crowley, Ph.D.North Hollywood, CaliforniaIntroductionNothing is.Nothing becomes.Nothing is not.— Aleister Crowley, The Book of LiesAlthough I have been using a form of \"hypnosis\" for more than fif-teen years now, I found this book by Steven Heller and Terry Lee Steelenot only illuminating, but intellectually staggering. It occurs to me that Ihave never really understood \"hypnosis\" before.When I was first taught \"hypnosis,\" it was called \"guided medita-tion,\" and was supposed to be a sort of synthesis of psychoanalysis andBuddhism, bringing one rapidly to the bedrock of consciousness. Then Iwas taught it all over again, but it was called \"astral projection\" and wassupposed to be literal journeys of some literal \"ego\" outside the body. Bythen I was being asked to lead seminars myself, and began includingsome of these techniques without making any specific claims about themexcept that they showed some unusual properties of the human mind.Since I had no degree at the time, if the word \"hypnosis\" was raised atall, I always said that we were using \"guided meditation,\" which wasonly somewhat similar to very mild \"hypnosis.\" I did not want anybodyto think they were going into deep hypnosis, since I was not sure I knewhow to handle that.Well, of course, many people very obviously went into \"deep hyp-nosis\" whether I intended it or not, and I learned eventually that I couldhandle that, and I got a degree and was qualified to mess with people'sminds. But somehow \"hypnosis\"—whether \"mild\" or \"deep\"—alwaysseemed a bit weird to me and I preferred to work with techniques Ithought I understood better.Now I have read Heller and Steele and realize that I am using\"hypnosis\" all the time, whether I know it or not. But then, it appears thatII"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"12Monsters & Magical Sticks Introductionevery salesperson, every lawyer, every politician, every cop, and everyhusband and wife having a quarrel, are using \"hypnosis\" as well as theyknow how and the world is, in many respects, a circus with rival gangs ofhypnotists trying to hypnotize one another.Of course, some of this is not entirely new to me. Several years ago,bothered by a set of \"allergy\" symptoms that puzzled my physician, Iwas persuaded to try a Christian Science healer. I was healed in onesession. The alleged \"allergy\" has never come back. This was not onlygratifying, but also aroused my curiosity, and I began reading a greatdeal of Christian Science literature. (I even went to their church servicesa few times, but my allergy to churches seems incurable, and that phasedid not last long.) I then began experimenting on myself, using what Iunderstood of Christian Science to heal other ailments when the symp-toms did not appear so serious that it was obvious damnfoolery to avoidmedical treatment. I found that I could heal quite a few minor conditionsin myself, and once or twice in friends. I did not set up shop as a psychichealer or anything of that sort because I seemed to have only minor talentin that field, but I suspect that everybody has as much of that talent as Ido, but most people are just afraid to try using it.What is comical about this little story of my mediocre career in faithhealing is that the principles I learned from Mrs. Eddy's books and herdisciples are the same principles you will learn in the following text, butMrs. Eddy never admitted she was using hypnosis. In fact, one wholechapter of Science and Health is devoted to denouncing hypnosis andhypnotists. Hypnosis, she thought, was the work of the devil (whodoesn't exist) and Christian Science is the work of God (who does exist)and hence hypnosis does not work, but Christian Science does. TheStrange Loop in that logic is typical of Christian Science-and of manyother systems that use hypnosis without realizing what they are doing.I think you will gain even more insight into why Dr. Heller explainsthe success of hypnosis by saying, \"There is no such thing as hypnosis?\"if you pick up a copy of Mrs. Eddy's Science and Health somewhere andread ten consecutive pages (any ten pages will do, since her style ishologrammic and the meaning is everywhere). After ten pages in Eddy-land come back and read a little of Dr. Heller again. You might begin tounderstand that there literally is no such thing as hypnosis and we are allin deep hypnosis more of the time than we realize.Since I am a devout believer in synchronicity, I paused while writingthese words and picked up another book I happen to be reading at thistime to check the Jungian hypothesis that, if I opened it at random, Iwould find a text that makes the above point even clearer. The book Iused for this experiment is The Politics of Irish Freedom, by GerryAdams who is President of Sinn Fein, a political party widely rumoredto be a \"front\" for the I.R.A. (although Sinn Fein, of course, denies this).This is the passage I found in the ideological exposition of Mr. Adams,who happens to be a member of the British Parliament whether or not heis also a \"front\" for the Irish Republican Army:There is no such thing as a neutral language, for language is themeans by which culture, the totality of our response to the world welive in, is communicated, and for that reason the Irish language had tobe destroyed. When a people have spoken a common language forthousands of years that language reflects their history, sentiments, out-look and philosophy.Mr. Adams goes on to discuss the bata scoir, which was a stick usedin 19th Century schools in Ireland. Each time a child spoke Irish, he orshe was hit with the stick, and the stick was then notched to record thenumber of such offenses. Some would call this cultural imperialism orbrainwashing or something like that, but few would call it \"hypnosis.\"Nonetheless, the number of Irish speakers in Ireland decreased fromnearly 100 percent circa 1800 to around five percent circa 1900 and awhole culture or reality-tunnel died in the process.There was no bata scoir employed in the United States when I was inmy teens, but some similar and more subtle training device was used onthe minds of my generation. When I entered high school, the Germansand Japanese were the bad guys in the world, and the Russians were ourgallant allies in the war against fascism. By the time I got out of highschool, the Russians were the bad guys and the Germans and theJapanese were our gallant allies in the war against communism. Whetheryou call this conditioning or hypnosis (but there is no such thing ashypnosis...), it worked with the majority of that generation. One reality-tunnel was extinguished and a new one was imprinted in its place.(For some techniques to explore your own reality-tunnels, get mybooks Prometheus Rising and Quantum Psychology; and for those of youwho want to do some self-reprogramming, check out Antero Alli's AngelTech: A Modern Shaman's Guide to Reality Selection, and ChristopherHyatt's brilliant Undoing Yourself with Energized Meditation. NewFalcon Publications will appreciate it and so will I.)"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Monsters & Magical SticksBetween 1970 and 1980 I lived in Northern California. Althoughthere are some \"redneck\" or \"moral majority\" enclaves even there, in thecities where I lived virtually everybody was some kind of radical—a po-litical radical, a philosophical radical or a radical therapist. Abortion wasa civil right. There was no legal gambling anywhere, although I hear thathas been liberalized a bit since I left. Bisexuality was a permissible varia-tion and very commonly seen. Science and Eastern mysticism were aboutto merge in some New Paradigm which would combine the best of bothglobal and brain hemispheres. Socialism, however, was the opinion onlyof an eccentric minority, and pacifism, although universally respected inour crowd, never had any influence on the national government.But there is no such thing as hypnosis.In the last five years, I have lived in Ireland. Abortion is illegal, andeven telling a patient where abortions may be obtained in England cancause a doctor to be prosecuted. Gambling on the other hand has beenlegal as far back as anybody remembers. Bisexuality, if it exists, has onlyvaguely been heard of, and homosexuality is known to be very offensiveto the Deity who invented AIDS to punish the bloody sodomites. Scienceand Eastern mysticism are hardly known, and the possibility of theirjoining in synergy arouses the blank stares that you might expect if yousaid a bicycle and a cow were about to mate and reproduce. On the otherhand, two of the five largest political parties are openly socialist (theLabour Party and the Workers Party) and one of those two (Labour) waspart of the most recent coalition government; Ireland is surrounded bysocialist states all over Europe, and cannot understand why Americansthink socialism is diabolical and impossible. As for pacifism, it is writteninto the constitution and all five major parties are officially pacifist: nolegislation contrary to Irish neutrality is ever even introduced into DadhEriann (the Parliament).And yet there is no such thing as hypnosis.There are, around the world, people living in reality-tunnels whichcause them to think that both the Californian and the Irish reality-tunnelsare insane or perverse. There are nudists and Buddhists and Russiancommunists and Albanian communists and Norse socialists and Frenchexistentialists and Samoan shamans and New York Jewish intellectualsand all of them know, for sure, that they happen to have the one correctreality-tunnel.And yet there is no such thing as hypnosis.IntroductionChristian Science works by Faith in God. Political and religious dif-ferences are caused by indoctrination or some mysterious process called\"brainwashing.\" All that \"astral projection\" I mentioned earlier justshows that occultists are very neurotic people easily prone to hallucina-tions.In Programming and Metaprogramming in the Human Biocomputer,Dr. John Lilly points out in three sentences something that is totallyobvious once stated, and yet will totally revolutionize your world onceyou begin to really understand it:In the Province of the mind, what is believed true is true or be-comes true, within limits to be found experimentally and experientially.These limits are further beliefs to be transcended. In the province of themind there are no limits.Timothy Leary used to say it even more simply, back in the 1960s:You can be anything you want to be, this time around.It is hard to believe that a whole culture could be destroyed when theIrish language was destroyed, and yet that happened. It is hard to believethat an allergy can go away when a Christian Science practitioner says itis gone, and yet that happened. It is hard to believe that there is no suchthing as hypnosis although we are all hypnotizing ourselves and oneanother all the time, and yet that is what is happening every day and why\"we\" are afraid that \"we\" are about to blow ourselves to hell with nuclearbombs.A neighbor once came to Nasrudin, the great Sufi sage or swindler(is there a difference?). \"Can I borrow some flour?\" he asked.\"I'd like to loan it to you,\" Nasrudin said, \"but unfortunately I have itdrying on the clothesline right now.\"\"But,\" the man protested, \"how can you dry flour on a clothesline?\"\"It's easy when you don't want to loan any,\" Nasrudin replied.If you don't understand that story and wonder how even a Sufi candry flour on a clothesline, read the following pages carefully. It will allbe clear when you finish. Then go read those ten pages from Mrs. Eddy.If it is still not clear that there are no limits in the province of themind, get a copy of Phil Laut's book, Money Is My Friend, which tellsyou how to become rich and stop worrying about money. Analyze what"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"16Monsters & Magical Stick?the Laut system has in common with this book and Christian Science. Ifyou are still puzzled, think about all this very deeply and slowly onemore time and then turn on the television at the time when all the chan-nels have their commercial breaks. You will soon see how easy it is todry flour on a clothesline. You might even see who creates the clothes-line that makes such marvels possible.Robert Anton WilsonDublin, Ireland23 January 1987Fore-Warned/AcknowledgementsWhen an individual wanders into a new area and is bitten by a dog,that is an unfortunate accident. However, when a sign has been postedthat says, \"Beware of Dog\" and the individual wanders in anyway and isbitten...well we could label that something else. As you wander into thenew areas of this book be advised that it is my intention to \"bite\" you.You have now been duly warned.It has been my experience that most individuals who read books onhypnosis are looking for a cookbook with exact recipes. For those of youwho believe that you need a cookbook, I recommend any book in the\"Betty Crocker\" series. You will not find the exact recipes here. Evenwith a cookbook, a master chef knows that making changes in the recipesis the difference between an average cook and a great one. A great cookis one that is creative and who adjusts the recipes according to circum-stances.I hope that as you read this work you will decide to be a creativecook...

My response has been, and is, \"You must learn thenecessary tools and techniques that help direct individuals to their owninner resources and creativity. Once you have done that, you must thenget the hell out of their way.\" I give that response because I believe thateach one of us has within, all the tools and solutions necessary for a more.look.

It is as if they were in a hurry to catch their own ass. When theyfail to catch that part of their anatomy, they act as if they are failures.

Of course,you don't want to put up the walls until you have completed the founda-tion; never build the foundation on quicksand. It is our hope that thisbook will be general blueprint for constructing flexible structure upon asolid foundation.I know that I am not unique in finding it difficult as to whom and inwhat order I want to thank for their contributions. To those I failed tomention, and to those I have not given the proper credit, I apologize. Asto those individuals I have mentioned, what I can write cannot comeclose to what I feel as to your contributions and efforts.The first and most important person I wish to thank is my co-authorTerry Lee Steele. If not for Terry, I Doubt that I would have continuedthis work to its conclusion. In addition to her direct contributions, therewas her well-placed foot in the proper part of my body, \"gently\" remind-ing me to work, and then work some: more. In addition, the \"Bullshit\"tasks that she, with unfailing good nature, tackled, made this book pos-sible. She is not only a delightful person, but also a talented, dedicatedindividual who is rapidly becoming a \"therapist's therapist.\"I would like to thank my friend and colleague, James Walker, Ph.D.,not merely for wading through my misspellings and improper sentencestructure, but also for raising several good questions that neededanswers. His questions led to the rewrite of several chapters. For thisextra work he helped to produce, I can only say (censored). I also wish toextend a special thanks to H. Brian Herdeg, M.D. To me, Brian is aunique physician, not only in the level of care (medical and personal) thatMonsters & Magical Sticks Fore - Warned/Acknowledgementshe delivers to his patients, but also for his willingness to open up to newmethods and approaches. While many physicians had, in the past,\"snuck\" patients to me, Brian was the first to openly accept whatever it isthat I do. In addition, he has \"lobbied\" to get other physicians to acceptmy methodologies, and has helped to present me to professional groups.He has also been instrumental in getting me into a hospital setting with-out subterfuge. (In the past, I was brought in as some relative of thepatient.) He has done all this without personal gain of any sort. For hisconfidence, trust and, most important, his friendship, thanks.I would like to extend a special thank you to a special lady, SusanSong. She has not only put up with the trials and tribulations of this book,but, more importantly, with me. Susan has read and re-read and then re-re-read rough (very rough) drafts of this book. She made several sugges-tions that have helped me clarify where I was going. She has alsocontributed to the organization of my seminars, and the \"nitty-gritty\"stuff in general. Without her contributions, I would have been buried inan avalanche of fertilizer.We would like to extend a special acknowledgment to John Grinderand Richard Bandler, known to many as Bandler and Grinder or simplyB and G. Their pioneering work, in what has come to be known as\"SYSTEMS and ANCHORING\" not only made our work easier, but,even more importantly, paved the road for many to travel.While we are not \"NLPers,\" there are areas in this work that draw onor overlap the NLP approach. The differences between our methodologyand NLP, while substantial, merely add spice to the recipe. B and G'smain contribution to the senior author was to \"give you a map that willmake it easier to do what you are already doing in your clinical setting\"(Richard Grinder, personal communication 1975).In addition to the people I have already mentioned, there are manymore I wish to thank. To all those individuals who have allowed me tomess\" around with their heads, thank you for your trust. I know I havelearned as much from you as I hope you have learned from me. To allthose professionals who have trusted me enough to train with me and torefer their patients, thank you. To the several hundreds of you who haveattended my seminars, thank you for your support and encouragement. Aspecial thanks to those \"terminal\" patients who have allowed me to workwith them, for reminding me who I am, and what is really important.Last, but not least, there are some others I wish to acknowledge.

Throughout our years of association, I have beenboth student and colleague. A persistent student, persuading Steve toassume the role of teacher, to define, guide, and share his insights. Anexcited colleague, wanting to get those puzzle pieces collected andpieced together so a more complete picture of hypnotic communicationwould be available and evident to others.Writing this book with Steve has been an interesting experience. Ithas also been educational, frustrating, and an elaborate test of patience. Iwas determined to create a book that gave details, explanations, andprovided basic principles and guidelines for applications in the therapysituation. Steve was equally determined not to produce a cookbook typeof book that leads the reader to believe that a magic, all-purpose, recipeexists. It does not. I believe we have succeeded.My hope is that as you read it you are enlightened, encouraged, andentertained. And, having read it, that you begin to creatively integrateknowledge, technique, and intuition.My gratitude goes to Shirley Coleman for hours of typing and clevermemos, and to all the family, friends, colleagues, and clients who pro-vided impetus and moral support. A special thank you to Mike Dickenwho is a constant source of strength, encouragement, and joy.Terry Lee SteeleHYPNOSIS — THE FIRST STEPThere's No Such Thing As Hypnosis? may appear to be a strangesubtitle for a book written by a man who has been in the field of clinicalhypnosis for many years. The title is sure to displease those who firmlybelieve that hypnosis exists, and the book itself will displease those whofirmly believe that hypnosis does not exist. I firmly believe that hypnosisis just a state.. .South of Oregon and North of Washington, and it doesn'treally exist except in people's minds. Paul Watzlawick, in his excellentbook, The Language of Change states, \"There's no such thing as pianoplaying; I have tried it several times and nothing came of it.\" One majorproblem in discussing or writing about the process of hypnosis is that,through the years, so many definitions of what hypnosis is or is not havebeen hooked into the word itself, that people have preconceived notionsand ideas. It might be said that they have been hypnotized into believingwhatever it is they believe about hypnosis.It is not the purpose of this book to give an academic definition ofhypnosis. There are many fine texts and case books that do an excellentjob of giving several different and conflicting definitions of hypnosis.These definitions, people are free to reject or not accept as they see fit. If,however, hypnosis means a special state in which a person is put intosome deep mystical state and then loses volition over their being becauseanother person, called a hypnotist, creates such powerful, overwhelmingsuggestions that the victim or subject is helpless to resist, then there is nosuch thing as hypnosis. If that \"power\" existed, I would not be writingthis book nor working at my profession. I would simply walk into anylarge corporation and cause the chief executive officer to give me thebusiness. If, however, we consider hypnosis as a generic term that21"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"22Monsters & Magical Sticks Into Hypnosis Lightlyencompasses all forms of altered consciousness, and do not considerhypnosis as a mystical state, we may then get a more clear picture thatfeels more comfortable.To further illustrate the use of the word \"hypnosis\" as a generic termthat encompasses many states, let us consider a state called sleep. Werecognize there is light sleep, deep sleep, REM sleep, restless sleep, etc.However, all of these are contained under the category called \"sleep.\"Experts still argue over just what produces sleep and why people sleep inso many ways, but no one denies the existence of the sleep state. If youwill picture a horizontal line and think of one end as conscious aware-ness and the other as sleep, you then can envision and grasp the manygradients between these two opposite points. You might accept hypnosisas an area between these two poles at which an individual's awareness ofhis surroundings are diminished, while awareness of internal processes,feelings, thoughts and pictures are increased.Another simile for hypnosis can be found in electricity. We all knowthat electricity exists, and yet the experts still argue over what electricityreally is. The only generally accepted notion is that electricity is a formof energy. You may consider hypnotic techniques as a group of methodsfor the production of a different form of energy in the brain, and the hyp-notic state a conduit for directing that energy toward the accomplishmentof goals.HYPNOSIS AS COMMUNICATIONIncluded in our definition of hypnosis is any form of communicationin which a person or persons, whether a hypnotist, wife, husband,teacher, or? uses words, tonality, expressions or movement that elicitand/or evoke within another person an internal experience, and that expe-rience becomes a reality of its own. For example, if I write or speak theword \"rose,\" you might think of a particular flower, perhaps red in color.I could mean a person named Rose, and someone else might remembersomeone getting up. If I change the meaning to a beautiful red rose, oneperson might remember a special occasion, the feelings, sounds, pictures,smells and, in effect, relive the entire experience. Yet another personmight make a terrible face because they are allergic to roses.I can remember an incident during which I was having a conversa-tion with a lovely woman, and another woman came to join us. I sud-denly found myself feeling about four years old \"seeing\" an aunt who, tome, was gargantuan. I felt the fear of being overpowered by her size and\"saw\" her in a polka dot dress. After a moment, I shook my head andreturned to the present to realize that the second woman's perfumereminded me of my aunt's perfume. The smell alone regressed me to thatchildhood experience. There's no such thing as hypnosis, and you need adeep trance and powerful suggestion to produce regression. Really???One technique of so-called traditional hypnosis is called \"negativehallucination.\" This is produced by putting someone in a \"hypnotic state\"and suggesting, for example, that they will not see or hear some personor object. A so-called \"good subject\" would come out of trance and notsee or hear as suggested. How many times have you called your childrenfor dinner and they have responded by not responding?An individual comes to your office stating, \"I can't make a decision;it's just impossible.\" That, too, is a negative hallucination. That individ-ual decided to seek you out, decided what route to take, and decided toenter into a transaction with you. Or, take the individual who states,\"Everybody hates me, they always have.\" Obviously, if s/he has lived totell their tale, someone, in all probability, cared for and helped him/herbut, s/he has excluded that portion of history from his/her reality. Justbecause someone makes a face at you, it doesn't mean they're not con-stipated. Again, there's no such thing as hypnosis; or perhaps it is allhypnosis.A FLAT WORLDOnce upon a time people believed that the world was flat. They weretold this by people in authority. As a result, they built their whole worldpredicated on staying within the confines of a flat world. If we restrictourselves to the old definitions of hypnosis, then we are experiencing aflat world. Our world becomes round when we step back, see, and hearthat so-called hypnotic phenomenon occur all around us without the needof a trance. Someone says to you, \"I can't be successful. I always fail.\"Yet, they know how to walk, they know how to talk, they know how todo those things and more—successfully. We are talking about a beliefsystem, a suggestion or suggestions that have been accepted and actedupon even at the expense of distorting reality.To recap, if you consider hypnosis as a specific state that alwaysincludes a deep trance, then there's no such thing as hypnosis. If, how-ever, you use hypnosis as a generic term to encompass anything thatalters perception, or changes consciousness, then you can realize thathypnosis is just a word. Within that word are things like meditation, fan-"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"Monsters & Magical Stickstasy, guided imagery, deep muscle relaxation—anything that encouragesor precipitates a person's turning inward and having an inner experiencethat becomes more profound or more important than the outer consensualreality.

Theystudy the player's method, see his playing style, until they grasp it all,\"knowing\" with that much money in front of him he has to be an expert.They take their limited funds, sit down, play and lose everything.

If only they would talk to the casino man-ager, they might learn that the \"expert\" is really the pizza king ofChicago. He knows everything about pizza and nothing about blackjack.He has enough money to buy large sums of chips and appearances aredeceiving. Even a monkey will get dealt a winning hand from time totime. The couple's mistake was to assume based on appearances.Once upon a time, there was a little boy and girl who heard someadults use big words, and saw them do amazing things: drive a car, vote,fight, and much more. The little boy and girl assumed that since they\"knew\" such things, they must be experts at life and parenting. The littleboy and girl set out to copy the adults only to suffer pain and frustration.Those adults were experts at pizza, but the children were too small tolook beyond appearances."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"26Monsters & Magical Sticky Meta 4 - Change - Life27ROSEBUSHESOnce upon a time there were two little rose bushes named Judy andJim. These rose bushes were comfortable in a nursery when two peoplecame in and took Judy, claiming they were expert gardeners and knew agreat deal about rose bushes—and they did. They planted Judy in richsoil with the best combination of sunshine, water and nourishment. Theykept the weeds and bugs away and handled Judy with kindness. Judyflourished and grew big and beautiful roses, and if rose bushes couldfeel, Judy was happy. Two other people went to the nursery and tookJim, stating they were expert gardeners and knew everything about roses.But, they were really pizza kings from Chicago. They planted Jim insandy, salty soil, with too much heat in the day and too much cold in thenight. They watered Jim too much and then too little, and they did noth-ing about the weeds and bugs. In spite of these things, Jim survived butwas wilted, stunted and sorry looking. Jim looked across the field at Judyand saw her beauty and decided (if a rose bush can decide) that theproblem was he was just basically defective and no damn good.Now, dear reader, if you could talk to a rose bush, I'm confident youwould say, \"Jim, it's not you! The experts were not experts, and it's yourenvironment that's the problem.\" But, to what purpose? A little rose bushcan't walk, drive a car or work. However, time goes by and Jim, by hookend by crook, learns to walk, talk, drive a car and work. He pulls himselfout of the crummy environment and moves to where Judy is: the richfertile environment and guess what? Wrong! Jim continues to wilt, andgrow little, ugly roses. Jim is so convinced that he's defective that hedecided, \"What's the use? It wouldn't do any good to even try.\" In addi-tion, he carries his past environment with him and \"knows\" that the richenvironment doesn't exist. Well, what can you expect from a rose bush?MONKEY BUSINESSThere once was a rhesus monkey who was put into a special cage.This cage had red, yellow and green squares. After several days, an\"experimenter\" set it up so that the red squares gave off intermittentshocks causing the monkey much pain. The monkey became anxious butsoon learned to avoid the red square. Next, the experimenter caused thered and yellow squares to give off intermittent shocks, and the monkeyacted as if he was a manic depressive, alternating from hyper-anxiety todepression and withdrawal. The monkey soon learned to avoid the redand yellow squares and then all the squares were electrified. The littlemonkey began to bite itself, beat its head against the bars and defecatedon himself. You might say the little monkey had been driven crazy. Thisexperiment took one month. He was then transferred to a second cagewith a white floor. Soft music was played, he was touched and held andfed Within a short time, he calmed down and within two weeks he wasplayful and exploring his cage. He could not be seen as different from amonkey from a rhesus population that had not been subjected to theexperiment. Well, what do you expect from a dumb monkey? He's not assmart as a man. He didn't know how to hold onto the past forever, norcontinue to anticipate disaster. He only knew how to adapt to changingcircumstances. When he was put back into the first cage, he was anxiousfor two days, but, after assuring himself there were no shocks, he beganto be as playful in that cage, too.Well, as I've pointed out, monkeys aren't as smart as men. Maybejust smarter than rose bushes.If, as you read the above meta-eights—a metaphor within a metaphorwithin a metaphor—you found yourself thinking, remembering, connect-ing, seeking, and understanding, it was only intended. To understand ametaphor, you must, in most cases, go into your own history, rememberthose situations that look similar and remember those words...But there's \"know\" such thing as hypnosis."},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"Everyday Hypnosis/Learning29Everyday Hypnosis/LearningWAKING HYPNOSISOne evening, a group of friends and I were having dinner at a localrestaurant. Our waiter was very distracted and he appeared to be agitatedand depressed. He was abrupt, slow and unfriendly. As a result, our ser-vice left a great deal to be desired. Since I wanted to have an enjoyableevening, I decided to \"talk funny\" to him in order to help him feel better.As he walked by our table holding a coffee pot, I touched his arm andsaid, \"I'm sorry that you forgot that special night...with that special per-son...those exciting things that happened...those very warm feelings thatwould embarrass you to talk about...since we are all strangers.\" For amoment his face went blank; he looked up to his left; his face then lit upand he said, \"How do you know about that?\" He then smiled and beganto laugh, and his whole attitude changed as if by magic. He said, \"Wow.That was some night. I don't know how you know about it.\"The next time he came to our table, I said to him, \"Wasn't it simplyamazing that when you remember those happy, warm feelings, your atti-tude continues to change, and you continue to feel even better?\" Wereceived delightful service throughout the rest of the evening. What waseven nicer, was that as we left he told us that we were one of the nicestparties he had ever waited on. He also asked us to be sure to ask for himwhenever we returned. Now, I have absolutely no idea as to what hehallucinated, but my communication resulted in his going back into hisown history. He then found an experience that filled in the blanks, andthat memory helped him to change his whole attitude in a matter ofseconds. Of course, there's no such thing as hypnosis, and if there is, heshould have gone deeper and deeper into a trance.28HYPNOTIC TRANSACTIONSOne classical definition of hypnotic suggestion is: using words thatcause the subject to go back in time and recover a memory that causes anemotional affect. If we accept that as a definition of hypnotic suggestion,then my communication, and the waiter's response, would fit very well.My communication left him with basically two choices: to ask me whatthe hell I was talking about, or to respond just as he did. I believe thatthese types of hypnotic transactions occur much more often than mostpeople would believe. They (hypnotic communication and responses) areeven more common in an emotionally charged environment. The therapyarena is one such environment.A patient enters a therapist's office, sits down and says, \"I am reallydown today. I went out on a date last night, and my date really hurt me.\"The therapist responds, \"I understand. That really feels bad.\" Whatspecifically does the therapist understand? Is the therapist remembering atime s/he was \"hurt\" because his/her date said, \"Don't bother to call me,I'll call you?\" or, \"I don't want to hurt you, but I am in love with yourbest friend\"? Perhaps the patient means that his/her date hit him/her onthe head with a hammer. In response to the statement \"...my date reallyhurt me,\" the therapist hallucinated...filled in with pictures, feelings andresponses from his/her own history. Who is hypnotizing whom? Theabove transaction would come pretty close to fitting the definition of ahypnotic transaction. In the therapy milieu, it is my belief that you eitheruse the tool called hypnosis, or you will end up being hypnotized by thepeople who are paying you to help them.ENTRANCING TONESIf we understand the word \"hypnosis\" to mean only a trance state,then our ability to recognize hypnotic transactions will be severely lim-ited. If, however, we use the word hypnosis to imply any transaction andcommunication that causes an individual to go into their own experiencesand call upon their own imagination in order to respond, we will have amap that will allow us to become aware of the hypnotic transactionsoccurring around us. In addition, if we begin to accept that these transac-tions can be \"triggered\" by not only words, but also visual cues, tones,People and things, then our map will be even more helpful.A colleague and myself were training a psychiatric resident in theuse of hypnosis. He brought us a video tape of his work with aschizophrenic.\" He told us that he was not only having trouble working"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"with that patient, but that by the end of the session, he was a nervouswreck. As we watched his tape, I began to laugh, which upset him evenmore. I stopped the tape and pointed out that his patient was being verysuccessful in hypnotizing him. I started the tape from the beginning andhelped him to see what I meant. The patient was sitting in a way I canbest describe as a pretzel. He was also talking \"word salad\" with manypauses between words. Within a few minutes, the resident was \"copying\"the patient: sitting in the same way; jumping from one idea to another;pausing between words, and with growing evidence of anxiety. Anotherway of describing their transaction would be as follows: the patient wasusing words, tones and so-called body language, and the resident wasresponding like a perfect hypnotic subject. By becoming aware of whatwas happening, the resident was able to interrupt what the patient wasdoing and to begin to get the patient to follow him.A woman entered my office very depressed and upset. She told methat her husband had called her a fat pig. I thought it was unkind for himto have said that, but I also thought that there were more graceful waysfor her to handle it, rather than becoming so depressed. As I began toprobe just how and when he had said it, it turned out that he had not usedthose words at all. She had heard \"that\" tone of voice and \"knew\" justwhat he meant.People do not passively \"register\" the sentences uttered by aspeaker. Instead they hear what they expect to hear. They activelyreconstruct both the sounds and syntax of the utterance in accordancewith their expectations.  — Aitchison, 1976TO REGRESSI asked her to close her eyes and \"remember that tone.. .until you arefeeling those feelings that let you know that he is calling you a 'fat pig.'When you have those feelings, signal me by raising the first finger ofyour left hand.\" After a minute or two, she signaled and I said, \"Now seehis face...looking just as it did then...while you hear that tone. Now, lethis face fade away and be replaced by that other person who used thattone at some other time in your life, and who used words like 'fat pig-'\"She was able to discover that her husband's tone (when he was angry) re-minded her exactly of her father's tone of voice when he was angry. Shealso recalled that he (her father) actually called her mother a fat pig, andtold her she was getting to be just like her mother. So, when she heardher husband's tone of voice, she disconnected from consensual reality,went into her inner reality, filled in words from out of the past, respondedto those words as if they had been said, and became depressed. All thatbased on what had happened many years before. Aitchison (cited) in dis-cussing Psyciholinguistics, stated:...it is not only a person's expectation of sound patterns that influ-ences what she hears, but perhaps to an even greater extent, her expec-tation of syntactic and semantic patterns.... When someone hears asentence, she latches on to outline clues, and \"jumps to conclusions\"about what she is hearing.Now, let us examine one hypnotic phenomenon called regression. Ahypnotist will use words (suggestions) designed to cause the subject to\"go back\" in time in order to re-experience some past event or to exam-ine some past event. Where this \"regression\" is successful, the subjectwill react, at least emotionally, as if the past event is happening in thepresent. If we examine the transaction between the woman and her hus-band, and what occurred as a result of his \"tone of voice,\" it would matchthe definition of a hypnotic regression. Of course, the woman was not ina trance. Or was she? As she explained what had happened to \"make herdepressed,\" she began to stare straight ahead. As she really got into herstory, I observed that her eyes had dilated, her breathing and color hadchanged, and her eyes had become glazed. When I slowly moved myhand across her line of vision, she didn't even see it. Any person whohad been trained in the basics of hypnotic phenomena would have beenable to see that she was in a trance. If her mere retelling of what had hap-pened produced a hypnotic state, we can wonder what the incident itselfmight have produced.In the \"real\" world of everyday life, hypnotic communications andtransactions take place all around you. As you open yourself up to theMany possibilities, I am sure you will begin to see more of them. What ofthe parent who gives a small child a \"dirty\" look and says, \"You'd betterclean up your room or else,\" and then walks away leaving the child towonder. \"Or else what? The Jolly Green Giant will throw me away?\"The chid then becomes anxious, agitated and then waits for disaster.What of the child who is told, \"What is the matter with you? Can't youdo anything right?\" and the child begins to think, \"I can't do anythingright\" turning the question into a directive. S/he may even come to"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"Monsters & Magical Stickbelieve that mommy and daddy will be pleased if s/he doesn't do any-thing right. If the child begins to carry out the suggestions often enoughwell, I don't need to tell you what those results could be.HYPNOSIS AND LIFE SCRIPTS\"TA\" (Transactional Analysis) therapists follow a concept they call\"Life Scripts.\" They believe that individuals are given a \"script\" tofollow, that, if painful and not changed, will cause that individual to actin ways that are self-defeating. \"You can't drink kid, you can't drinkuntil you are a man.\" That kind of message can translate unconsciouslyinto: \"To be a man, I have to drink.\" Here is the implantation of a sug-gestion that may take such firm hold that the individual ends up an alco-holic. In fact, the \"TA\" people contend that this is not uncommon.Another way of looking at this example would be: The words usedcaused the individual to fill in his own meaning. This meaning became apost-hypnotic suggestion, which he later carries out successfully...bybecoming a drunk.One case reported by a therapist was of a homosexual who, as ayoung boy, had been told, \"Don't you ever do that [the 'that' being get-ting caught playing doctor] with girls.\" He was then beaten with a strap.The boy translated this transaction into, \"It is bad to do this with girls,but it is OK to do it with boys.\" Years later he is labeled \"homosexual\"as a result of being such a good hypnotic subject.In the above examples of the alcoholic and the homosexual, we canfind something important to consider. As a result of what I call hypnotictransactions, those individuals learned to believe certain ideas. From theirideas, they learned to behave in ways that some would label painful.Before we go forward, I would like to take you back...to our friend, thewaiter. Several months after the incident I described, I returned to thatrestaurant with several friends. As fate would have it, we were given atable in his section. When he came to get our order, he stopped, stared atme, and said, \"Don't I know you from somewhere?\" I replied, \"I camehere often in the past.\" He accepted this explanation and went about hisbusiness. I explained to my friends what I had done with him in the past.We all agreed he was a friendly and cheerful person. Toward the end ofour meal, he came by and asked us if we wanted anything else. Severalof us ordered coffee. He returned holding the coffee pot, stopped, stared,smiled, and said, \"Now I know who you are. I still don't know how youknew about all of that.\" With that he sat down in an empty chair andbegan to tell us how I had reminded him of a certain girl, and nowthey were engaged. After he finished, I attempted to explain to him whatI had done, but he wouldn't believe it. He continued to insist that I hadinside information.Remember now...that when I had \"talked funny\" to him, he washolding a coffee pot in his hand. Part of what I had said involved thefeeling of warmth. In a way I could have never predicted, his mind hadmade an instant connection to the coffee pot, the incident, the feelings,and me. In short, a one trial learning experience. Seeing me only trig-gered a small part of the experience. The coffee pot triggered the wholething. We could call the whole transaction a learning experience. It mayhave been a weird one, but a learning experience nonetheless. As a pointof fact, there are many hypnosis researchers who contend that all learn-ing takes place in a state that is very much like a hypnotic one. Somewould even say that learning and hypnosis are merely two differentwords that describe the same thing.2 + 2 = HYPNOSISNow, if someone were to ask you to add 2 + 2, I am confident thatyou would respond with the correct answer. If you were asked how youknew the answer, you might reply that you learned it as a child. In otherwords, the question itself caused you to go back into your personal his-tory and find the \"proper\" associational connection. You would havedone that instantly, without conscious awareness of the process. Anotherway of stating the 2 + 2 example might be as follows: When you were achild, an individual who was an authority figure—called a teacher—stood in front of your class. S/he wrote on a blackboard 2 + 2 = 4, andverbally repeated that information many times. In addition, s/he askedthe class to remember the answer so that when you were asked to add2 + 2, you would automatically respond, 4. We might agree that theabove transaction could be given the labels: teaching and learning. If weexamine the transaction more carefully, and from a different perspective,we might also agree that it bears a striking resemblance to the classicaldefinition of \"hypnotic suggestion\" and \"post-hypnotic response.\"Now,...think about the waiter and his pot of coffee and his response. It isas if the pot of coffee had become the trigger (just like the question about2 + 2) which caused him to go back into his personal history and find theanswer.\" In this case, the answer was to respond to me with full mem-ory, etc."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"34Now, speaking of stage hypnosis, a volunteer is brought up on thestage and put into \"that\" state, and told repeatedly that when s/he hearsthe snapping of the hypnotist's fingers, s/he will respond by singingDixie. The hypnotist then snaps his/her fingers and the subject respondswith the \"right answer\" by singing Dixie. Ask yourself...NOW...otherthan the shorter time factor involved, what is the difference between\"learning\" 2 + 2 = 4 and the transaction between the stage hypnotist andthe subject?The stage hypnotist now chooses another volunteer and suggests thatwhen a red light is turned on, the subject will raise her left hand. Severalminutes later, the hypnotist turns on the red light, and the subject raisesher left hand. So what?! We could call that an example of a post-hyp-notic suggestion.You are driving down a busy street, listening to the radio, and deepinto your own thoughts. Suddenly, a traffic light turns red and—guesswhat? You stop (hopefully) without thought and almost automatically.You might call your action a \"conditioned response,\" and you mightcontend that it is different from the stage hypnotist red light example.Yet, if the red light/hand raising suggestion and response were repeatedseveral times, you might imagine what the subject would do whenevershe saw a red light.In addition to the definitions of hypnotic transactions and communi-cation you have read thus far, I would like to add: hypnosis is a form ofeducation. Ideas, beliefs, possibilities, fantasies, and much more, may be\"suggested\" and, if accepted, and acted upon several times, they maybecome a conditioned part of your behavior. In addition, under certaincircumstances, a conditioned response can be established in one trialwithout repetition, and without \"practice.\" Again, think about the waiter.We never \"practiced\" his response, or my \"suggestion,\" and yet monthslater, he responded. It is my belief that all behaviors, useful or not, arelearned via some kind of hypnotic transaction.CASE I: SELF-DESTRUCTIVEA bright and talented young man was referred to me with the pre-senting problem of \"always blowing his opportunities.\" Prior to seeingme, he had been in formal therapy for two years searching for the answerto his problem. His problem had been labeled as characterlogical disor-der. He had also been told that he had tendencies toward sociopathy andself-destruction. (Actually, he talked more like a psychiatrist than aMonsters & Magical Sticks Everyday Hypnosis/Learning35\"patient\") He had completed one full year of college with a 4.0 average.He had attempted to complete his second year three times, but, due to hisdismal performance, he had been forces to drop out each time. Due to hisobvious talents and intelligence, he had been hired by several companiesin various management training capacities. This, in spite of his not hav-ing completed college. However, each time he was given a promotion, orhis position was to be made permanent, he would go on a drunk, misswork and end up getting fired. In one instance, he had gone so far as toattack and injure his immediate superior.The young man had been raises within a strict, European-style envi-ronment in which the father was the unquestioned head of the family. Hewas very afraid of his parents, and, as a child, like most children, hebelieved that they knew everything. As a student in the American system,he was encouraged to ask questions. Whenever he questioned his fatheron any subject, he would be met with a verbal assault, and, in manycases, he would be punished. While in a formal state of hypnosis(whatever that is), he recovered a very clear visual image: he saw hismother standing over him, pointing a finger at him, and screaming. Hewas then able to \"hear\" her words: \"Don't you ever try to be better thanyour father.\" He was able to recall his feelings of terror and impendingdoom. The fact that his father was a retired mailman who had neverattended college is probably not...VERY IMPORTANT. Since there'sno such thing as hypnosis, it is just a coincidence that every time he wasabout to go beyond his father, something happened which stopped himfrom being better than his father. He was a very good boy. He wasmerely doing what his mother had told him.Let us assume that a part of our young man recognizes his talents andpotential and wants to use them, while another part of him says, \"Whatare you trying to do guy? Be better than your father and lose yourmother's love?\" (or whatever). This conflict could produce a classicalapproach/avoidance conflict. The closer he gets to becoming successful,the closer he gets to \"being better\" than his father, the more he runs intopast suggestions and their attendant fears. The further he runs from usinghis talents and abilities, the more his successful part starts pushing him.The results are stress, pain, fear and repeated failure no matter whichway he turns. Of course, since his mother did not use a crystal ball to putinto a trance, no hypnosis was involved ... REALLY?"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"ANXIETY AND HYPNOSISNow, let us go back to our metaphoric stage hypnotist. We couldimagine him giving the following suggestion: \"When I pull on my tie justonce, you will raise your left hand. When I pull on my tie twice, you willlower your left hand.\" We could define this transaction as the giving of apost-hypnotic suggestion to be triggered by a specific visual cue (thepulling of the tie).A man walks into a party and sees a woman looking at him in a\"funny\" way. His heart begins to pound; his stomach knots; his palmsbegin to sweat; he panics, and hurriedly walks out of the party saying tohimself, \"I can't handle 'this'\"—whatever \"this\" is to him. If we stepback and examine that transaction, we could conclude that something he\"saw\" in her face triggered his responses. In effect, the way she waslooking at him acted \"as if\" a visual cue that triggered his response. (Justlike the stage hypnotist pulling on his tie.) His response may, in fact,have little or nothing to do with the reality of the situation. The womanmay even have difficulty with her eyes and was \"looking at him in thatway\" because she was having trouble seeing him. Dr. Max Hamilton(1955) addresses this subject in relationship to anxiety states when hestated:Thus the patient suffering from an anxiety state may not be able todescribe the situation that provokes the anxiety; i.e., it may appear tohim that his anxiety is without cause.This awareness of the relation of past experience to present experi-ence is fundamental, for it implies that every conscious experience ismodified by past experience; i.e., the actual event of experiencing ispartly determined by past experience. This is equivalent to saying thatno emotion is twice experienced in exactly the same way. Thus, allbehavior, including its emotional aspect, is learned behavior.It is my firm belief that our problems and limitations (as well as oursuccessful attitudes and behaviors) are the result of some form of hyp-notic transaction/communication. In the Clinical Hypnosis: InnovativeTechniques® training seminars, I have demonstrated that so-called\"hypnotic phenomena\" can be produced not only via words, but throughfacial expressions, body postures, certain tonalities, and by merelystaring. These experiences have led me to conclude that hypnosis is amethod of communication which need not be limited to words alone, butrather may take a multitude of forms.Monsters & Magical Sticks Everyday Hypnosis/Learning37I CAN'T-I WONTIf a man were too appear at your office suffering the following com-'nts' terminal cancer, his wife has run off with the milkman, his son isbeing tried for murder, and the bank has just foreclosed on his home, wemight agree that his problems are reality problems. It would be fair to saythat logical, reality problem-solving would be in order. Where can he gofor treatment of his 'cancer? How can he go about getting the necessarylegal advice? What steps does he need to consider and in what order?However, the average client or patient who appears at a clinician's officeis not often suffering from such \"reality\" problems, nor are they in suchdire straits. In all probability, their reality situation is not substantiallydifferent from that of a general cross section of people. Yet, these indi-viduals maybe anxious, depressed, or even \"acting\" psychotic. If weconsider the possibility that their presenting problems are the result ofsome form of hypnotic transaction, then their problems are not based onlogic or reality (much like the man at the party who ran because \"she\"looked at him in a \"funny\" way). To attempt to apply logical solutions toillogical (and probably hypnotic) problems is, in my opinion,ILLOGICAL therapy.A man says to his therapist, \"I can't go out and meet women!\"Obviously, he has seen other men meet women. If the therapist says,\"Come on, John, other men meet women. You have met women in yourlife. You really ought to try it.\" that therapist has goofed. John probablyknows all of \"that\" and has no doubt heard that \"logical advice\" before.If logic were the answer, he would have solved his problem, and wouldbe using his money for more enjoyable endeavors than therapy. Howlogical is it for an individual to raise their hand when a hypnotist pulls onhis tie? Why not be illogical? Tell the man to go out and get rejected byat least ten women, but to take careful notes as to his responses. PaulWatzlawick (1978), in confronting the issue of logical versus morecreative approaches, stated:...Then it also reveals the inappropriatenesss of a procedure whichessentially consists in translating this analogic language into the digitallanguage of explanation, argument, analysis, confrontation, interpreta-tion, and so forth, and which, through translation, repeats the mistakewhich made the Sufferer seek help in the first place instead of learningthe patient's right-hemispheric (hypnotic) language and utilizing it asthe royal road to therapeutic change."},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"Monsters & Magical Sticks(For those of you who would like a more complete description ofillogical methods that work, may I recommend Dr. Watzlawick's finebook, The Language of Change.)I believe that hypnosis is the \"language of the right hemisphere\" and,therefore, a royal road to therapeutic change.SVENGALI AND TRILBYIf we begin to realize that words, and other forms of communication,may cause an individual to turn inward and create a hallucinated world towhich the individual responds, we have broadened our concept of hyp-nosis itself. If that hallucinated world is one in which choices are reducedor excluded, and the individual is conditioned to respond in set ways, wewould also have a better understanding of hypnotic suggestion and phe-nomena. Of course, there will be those that say, \"That can't be hypnosis.The person was not in a trance. No one was wearing a cape, and no oneused a crystal ball.\"A question for you, the reader, is: Just when did Svengali and Trilbylive? For those of you who are not sure, we can limit the time frame tobetween this day and sometime in the past. Give up?In reality, Svengali and Trilby never lived. They were the product ofa novelist's imagination. Yet, there are many people who have beenhypnotized into believing that they were real. But, of course, lest weforget, there's no such thing as hypnosis.. .or perhaps it is all hypnosis.I would like to bring back our metaphoric friend, the stage hypnotist.When we left him, he was giving his subject the following suggestion:\"When I pull on my tie once, you will raise your left hand. When I pullon it twice, you will lower your hand.\" Now, where that \"suggestion\" isaccepted by the subject, we can expect that s/he will respond asrequested. If the signal is given often enough, the poor subject willdevelop a conditioned response. Those who have been trained in tradi-tional hypnotic phenomena will recognize the following: each time thesignal is given, the subject will respond in a set, stereotyped sequence ofsteps. Each individual's responses may be different from that of another,but each will respond in a set, almost compulsive fashion. Now, what Ihave trouble understanding is this: how does the hypnotic subject'sstereotypical responses differ from that of so-called neurotic responses?The \"neurotic,\" upon certain conditions, (signals/cues) tends to respondin a set, stereotyped, compulsive way. What, pray tell, is the difference?IVForget ItAMNESIA REMEMBEREDBefore it's forgotten completely, I would like to bring up the subjectof amnesia and its relationship to the subject of this book. Freud definedamnesia as the repression of traumatic material that the ego (I might callit the conscious mind) is not capable of handling. If we accept that defi-nition as accurate, it would be safe to assume that the traumatic informa-tion is still there, but the individual has no conscious awareness of thetrauma. If that trauma is still there, then in all probability the affect andthe consequences are still active. However, due to the amnesia, the indi-vidual will experience unpleasant feelings without knowing their source.Since people do not like not knowing, they find something in their exter-nal reality to blame. That \"thing\" may be totally unrelated, symbolic, orit may contain a feature that reminds an individual, unconsciously, of theoriginal trauma The individual may then react with what some psychol-ogists term the \"as if\" affect: responding to a current situation withresponses and feelings as if they were responding to a past situation.Several years ago while doing research on hypnosis, a professor ofpsychology induced a somnambulistic trance in a subject. The subjectwas capable of the most profound hypnotic phenomena, including post-hypnotic amnesia. The thrust of this research was to test the theory that,upon carrying out post-hypnotic suggestion, the subject would re-enterthe hypnotic state. While in this somnambulistic state, the subject wastold that when a clock chimed 10:00 P.M. at that evening's faculty party,she would remove one of her shoes, place it on the dining room table,and put roses into the shoe. Further, it was suggested that she would haveno memory of the suggestion, it would appear to be her own idea, andshe would feel compelled to finish her task. \"A very interesting thing39"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"Monsters & Magical Stickshappened on the way to the forum.\" While she was carrying out thehypnotic suggestion, the professor asked her what she was doing. Shereplied that her husband had given her a beautiful crystal vase thatlooked just like her shoe and she had never known what to do with it.She went on to state that it had suddenly dawned on her how to arrangeflowers in the vase and she had to try it in her shoe before she forgot.While her explanation appears absurd, she acted as if she believed shewas telling the truth. As the professor tried to explain to her how ridicu-lous her story was, she became anxious, agitated and very defensive. Theexperiment was terminated due to her extreme anxiety and discomfort.Now, if we examine the preceding example objectively, we can see acase of post-hypnotic suggestion being carried out without any consciousawareness of the suggestion's source. Further, it shows how desperatelythe subject searched for a \"logical\" explanation of her actions and showsthe emotional upheaval produced when the subject's explanation waschallenged. You, the reader, might be saying, \"So what, she was justcarrying out a hypnotic suggestion.\" But, I believe this \"hypnotic phe-nomena\" is recreated in all our lives more often than we would believe.Take the man who walked into the party and \"saw\" the womanlooking at him in a strange way, and responded with rapid heart beat,knots in his stomach, saying to himself, \"I know why she's looking at methat way, she hates me.\" If someone were to challenge his interpretation,he would probably defend it and perhaps become irrational. But, ofcourse, there's no such thing as hypnosis. If my thesis is correct, then theman's response makes as much sense as the woman did with the shoe.Attempting to make sense out of his action and responses will be tediousand probably accomplish very little or less.CASE 2: FEAR OF HEIGHTSAn example of one hypnotic technique I use along with a partial casehistory should illustrate how the above fits together. A woman in her 50shad a terrifying fear of heights. She \"knew\" it was because she had fallenoff a five-foot ladder at about eight years old. I told her if the ladder wasthe cause, then anyone who fell off something five feet high would havethe same fear she had. I asked her to close her eyes and see herselfclimbing a ladder until she felt all the fear and to signal with the firstfinger of her left hand when she was in touch with that fear. I observedher facial expression, breathing rate, and general appearance. As sheevidenced a state of fear, I touched her right arm lightly and said in aForget Itslow, even tone: \"Hold onto that feeling, and remember when I touchyou, you can experience the fear immediately.\" I then snapped my fin-gers and said in a faster pace, \"Replace that picture with one of beautifulflowers, smell them and feel the pleasure.\" I observed the changes untilshe appeared calm and relaxed. I then told her that, when I touched herarm, she would feel the fear and, as if watching a slide projector, shewould see scenes clearly going back to the source of that fear and tosignal when there. When she signaled, I told her to let go of the uncom-fortable feeling as I snapped my fingers and to watch as if seeing some-one else until she saw and/or heard something that connected for her andthat she wouldn't return to conscious awareness until that connection wasmade.After approximately five minutes, she opened her eyes and told thefollowing story: When she was about five, she had a friend who used toclimb on boxes and jump off. Her mother caught her one day and told herthat one day she was going to break a leg and it would serve her right.Her mother also said that would be a good thing because otherwise shewould fall off something high and kill herself. That was a powerfulhypnotic suggestion planted beautifully. When she fell off the ladder, itwas the same as shining a red light and having the subject raise a hand.From that point on, in her mind, the next fall would kill her and she hadno memory of the \"suggestion.\" She then protected herself by developinga phobic reaction to heights. If she avoided heights, she wouldn't die.None of this makes sense except in her mind; there it was real.The resolution of the problem was accomplished by having her closeher eyes and see herself as an army demolition expert. I then touched herarm and told her to \"see\" all those fears as time bombs and safely blowthem all up; that she would then feel the pleasure of the flower and seeherself in the garden and to signal when she completed the task. Whenshe signaled, I told her that she would arouse herself bringing back thosegood feelings. With that, I snapped my fingers to remind her of all thosegood feelings.Now, having someone blowing up time bombs doesn't make anymore sense than the original hypnotic trauma, except it works. I haveobserved people evidencing severe anxiety and then a deep sigh of reliefwhen they have finished. Later, many have told me that they were lessafraid in general and were responding more comfortably to what hadbeen their problem area. If we again grasp the concept that the problem is"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"42Monsters & Magical Sticksreally a metaphor, then blowing up time bombs is simply the right toolfor the right job, metaphorically speaking.ROCKET LAUNCHINGIf you were to witness the launching of a guided missile, you mightbe put into a state of awe. You could appreciate the power and sophisti-cation without understanding any of the intricacies—unless you were anexpert in the field. You might consider the missile as a vehicle thatrequires a guidance system and a triggering device. To relate this missilemetaphor to our subject, you might consider a past hypnotic-like sugges-tion as the guidance system, directing behavior (the vehicle) toward atarget, and the triggering device as the specific stimulus that triggers thehypnotic suggestion. However, for the vessel to be propelled, it musthave fuel, and, in our metaphor, fear is the fuel that keeps the systemgoing.Underneath all so-called problems, lies that fuel called fear: fear ofrejection, fear of dying, fear of falling, fear of not being good enough.Whatever you tag it, it still comes out fear. Fear is what makes the fieldfertile for the \"planting\" of hypnotic suggestions which result in behaviorlabeled by some psychiatrists and psychologists as neurotic, psychotic,paranoid, manic-depressive and, in rare cases, normal.There was a case reported some years back of a young woman whocouldn't say \"No.\" She was labeled nymphomaniac. Hypnosis revealedthat, as a child, she was expected to obey without question. Her motherwould fly into rages if she didn't. One day, she said \"No\" to her mother.Her mother beat her and she fell back into a stove and was burned by hotwater while her mother screamed, \"Don't you ever say 'No'!\" As ayoung woman, whenever a man asked her for sex, she would always say\"Yes.\" Without even knowing why, the fear of saying \"No\" was so great,she carried out the hypnotic suggestion by saying \"Yes.\"Remember the young man who, every time he gets close to beingbetter than his father, blows it by getting himself fired? He, too, wasresponding due to his fear and the suggestion of the past. The cast ofcharacters is different but the story (and the monster called fear) is thesame.Fear doesn't have to be rational to affect us powerfully. If you everhad someone pull an \"April Fool's\" joke that you believed and respondedto, or if you have awakened at night hearing creaking in the house andfound yourself responding with fear, etc., then you know fear needn't beForget It43rational. Fear has been known to block the effects of Novocain in thedental patient. Surgeons are aware that a severely fearful patient is a ripecandidate to require more anesthesia, to die on the table, or to take muchlonger to recover, etc. Put this emotion which causes so many physicaland mental responses together with a post-hypnotic suggestion such as\"Don't be better than your father,\" and you have a potent combinationthat needn't make sense to affect a person's life in painful ways.PUTTING THE PIECES TOGETHERThere was a woman who had been institutionalized on three separateoccasions. Her history was very interesting. As a little girl, she hadwatched her mother go crazy and had seen her taken away. Her fatherwould get drunk and yell at her, \"You're just like her.\" That's a prettystrong suggestion and, of course, fear is already there. So, she ends upbeing institutionalized and dubbed crazy, and there's no such thing ashypnosis. There is very little difference between the above case and the\"dynamics\" of the subject raising his hand at a red light or at the pull of atie.Remember the woman with the shoe? She became fearful whenquestioned, and then irrational. The more fearful she became, the moreirrationally she tried to find a \"logical\" reason and to defend her behav-ior. If, for some reason, the sequence were repeated several times, shecould develop a conditioned reflex. She might go around trying differentarrangements in different shoes. She repeats her behavior to prove shewasn't crazy the first time!I believe that all learning follows the principles of hypnosis or thatall hypnosis follows the principles of learning. You will have to decidefor yourself. A child's first experience of reading is through suggestion.For example, the child is shown a picture of a cat. She sees the lettersC-A-T, and the teacher repeats \"C-A-T spells cat\"; see the picture?Sooner or later the child takes the suggestion. It would be just as easy toteach the child that F-Y-Z spells cat. The fear of not belonging, theauthority of the teacher, and the repetition of suggestion all combine toproduce learning. I am not, for a moment, forgetting positive reinforce-ment in learning: complimenting the child on his good spelling is impor-tant. So is telling the child that children should be seen and not heard,and then complimenting the child for being so quiet. Of course, in thelatter example, the child might grow up shy and withdrawn, but theprinciple remains the principle."},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"Belief Systems45VBelief Systems+/- HALLUCINATIONUsing traditional hypnosis, you could take a good subject (whateverthat is), induce a deep trance (whatever that is), and suggest to the subjectthat, when he opens his eyes, he will \"see\" six growling dogs movingtoward him in a menacing way. This \"good\" subject would, upon open-ing his eyes, respond very strongly to the suggested \"metaphor.\" If hehappened to be connected to physiological monitoring devices, theywould register his strong responses. While responding to this hypnoti-cally induced metaphor, the subject would evidence anger and defen-siveness to any suggestion that the dogs were not really there. His innerbelief system tells him that they (the dogs) are real, and that's how hewill respond.Experts in the art of hypnosis would define the above phenomenonas a hypnotically induced positive hallucination—that is, creating some-thing that doesn't exist, to which a subject responds as if it does. Anotherway of defining the above phenomenon would be to state that, throughhypnosis, a belief was temporarily induced (metaphorically) within thesubject; that this belief became his inner map of the world, and heresponded as if his metaphor were the real world. As long as his \"beliefsystem\" continues to be operative, he will continue to respond to the\"dogs\" as if they are real. Bandler and Grinder (1975 a,b) contend thatwe do not operate on the world directly or immediately, but ratherthrough internal maps (belief systems) of the world, and that the \"map isnot the territory.\" The patient—or any individual—who says, \"I can'tsucceed\" or \"No one has ever loved me\" is, in effect, using language todescribe his map (inner belief system), but not necessarily the real world,or his real experiences.44Maps, like language, select certain features and ignore others, andlike language maps are cultural expressions of elements significant tosociety. '   -Aziz, 1978I might add that the individual's belief systems are more an expres-sion of elements he has learned to believe are significant. However, whathis map has left out may be more important than what he continues to\"see.\"Once a person becomes aware of the cultural bias in map-making,he or she can never again take a map as an accurate depiction of theworld Creating a map is like sculpting a statue. What matters is notonly what remains in view, but also what has been whittled away.— Human Nature, Jan. 1979, Vol. 2, no. 1, p. 34We might state the above proposition in the following manner: we donot respond to reality (whatever reality is). In effect, we respond to andoperate upon reality based on our metaphors which become our individ-ual and personal reality.BELIEFS: GOOD OR BADTo every transaction between individuals—whether it be betweenfriends lovers, parent/child, patient/therapist—each person brings withhim/her a set of belief systems, or inner maps. I believe that most ofthese belief systems are effective and enable individuals to obtain theirdesired goals. However, some of these belief systems may be less thaneffective, and may lead to painful destinations. The individuals whocome into a therapist's office seeking help, also bring with them a wholehistory, a whole background, a whole set of belief systems. Most of thesebelief systems are constructive and useful—otherwise those individualswould not have survived long enough to seek help. But, in areas in whichthey are evidencing pain and dysfunction, their belief system, in thatarea, is either \"the problem\" or prevents them from finding the solution.It is as if once upon a time they were given a map that indicated thatSan Diego, California was really San Francisco, California. They havespent a great deal of their life trying to prove to everyone that San Diegois San Francisco, and then sneaking up to San Francisco and moving itbrick by brick to San Diego to prove that their map was really right. Ibelieve it would be much more helpful to help them make a new map."},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"46Monsters & Magical SticksIt is one of my basic belief systems that individuals have been hypno-tized into their metaphoric belief systems, whether those metaphors aregraceful and efficacious, or painful and self-limiting. As I have statedearlier, I believe that all learning is a form of hypnosis, and that hypnotictransactions occur between people all the time. The individual who hasbeen hypnotized into \"seeing\" six growling dogs responds more or lessthe same way as the person who is \"sure\" he can't succeed, or who\"knows\" she will never find anyone to love her, or who \"hears\" voicestelling him to do strange things, etc. Those individuals are \"sure\" ofthose things because their belief systems exclude any facts that mightprove otherwise. Too often, in my opinion, therapists are prone to acceptthose painful maps as accurate, and then help their patients to \"really getinto the feelings.\"An individual enters a therapist's office and complains that no onehas ever loved him or been kind to him; that everyone has \"ripped himoff.\" If the therapist accepts those statements as being true in fact, then Ibelieve that the therapist has experienced being hypnotized by thepatient. If you will now consider hypnosis as itself a metaphor—that is,hypnosis substitutes one type of awareness for another, one reality foranother—then the therapist has been hypnotized into accepting another'sreality and awareness as true. In the first place, since that individual hassurvived to tell his tale, someone, in the past, has been kind to him, fedhim, saw to his clothing, etc. What of the kids he played with as a child?Gifts he received in the past? Is he lying? That's one possibility. Anotherpossibility is that his belief systems are such that he has excluded fromhis conscious awareness anything that might contradict his personal\"metaphors.\" He may even distort his conscious awareness to \"fit\" hismetaphors. The therapist who accepts the patient's \"metaphor\" as realityis going to find him/herself following the patient's map...and ending upjust as lost. But, therapists don't do that...do they? Ridiculous isn't it? Ofcourse, a conservative Republican might insist that all Democrats arehorse thieves, but not all horse thieves are Democrats. A liberal Demo-crat might \"prove\" that all Republicans have \"sold out\" to big business,but those things are different, aren't they?In the example of the hypnotically induced metaphor (six growlingdogs), \"suggestion\" keeps the hallucination operative. Where an individ-ual \"knows\" that everyone hates him, or she will always fail, or whateverthe problem may be, his belief systems keep those hallucinations going.We might consider that, at some point in time, someone or somethingstems47created a metaphor (or hypnotic suggestion) that he interpreted to meanthat people hate him, or that he will always fail. During his lifetime, hehas, in all probability, experienced someone liking and approving of him,and has no doubt been successful at many things; yet his belief systemsproduce the hypnotic phenomenon called \"negative hallucination\" (notseeing or hearing what there is to see or hear), which results in not''seeing\" or \"hearing\" information that conflicts with what he believes. Ineffect, his belief systems have created an inner map, and he \"selects\"from the world those signposts that match the map. Just as attempting toconvince a hypnotic subject with logic that the \"growling dogs\" are notreal will be met with resistance, so too will attacking his inner beliefsystems most often be met with the same results...\"resistance.\"BELIEFS AS MEMORIESAs I stated earlier, we to not respond to, or operate on the world(reality) itself, but rather we operate or respond to the world based on ourinternal sets of belief systems. To the same \"real\"-world situation, therecan be, and often is, a multitude of responses and beliefs. Two people goto the beach together; one of them smiles and says, \"Doesn't that lookbeautiful? It feels so warm and pleasant. Wow! I just love the beach.\"The other person responds with, \"Gag, it's awful, terrible and dirty. Lookat all the sand fleas and the tar on the ground. The heat makes me stickyand smelly. I don't know how you can stand it.\" Well, the beach is thebeach is the beach, and yet...two entirely different, and incompatible,responses. Each individual is responding physiologically, psychologi-cally, and emotionally based on their own belief systems as to the beach.These belief systems stem from their own \"memories\" (metaphors) as tothe meaning of a beach to them, and these \"memories\" have, in fact,become their own individual reality.Memories are thus physical systems in brains whose organizationand activities constitute records or representations of the outside world,not in the passive sense of pictures, but as action systems. The represen-tations are accurate to the extent that they allow the organism to repre-sent appropriate actions to the world.— J.Z. Young, 1978One might be tempted to say that the beach has become \"as if\" ahypnotic cue that sets into motion certain specific responses, based on"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"48Monsters & Magical Stickseach individual's \"memories\" as to the beach. But, of course, hypnosiscannot result from a beach, or a memory.. .can it?Belief systems, whether graceful and efficacious, or painful anddestructive, are formed in a multitude of ways: modeling; learningmodels; circumstances; traumas; repetition of events; and suggestions;etc. It is my belief, that no matter how they are formed, they affect all ofour behaviors in ways that are similar to that of hypnotic phenomena.Whatever the specific causative factors may be, belief systems are atleast partially created by, and continue via, the vehicle of suggestion andthe examples and parameters set by others.We must think of a world image then, as the most comprehensive,most complex synthesis of the myriads of experiences, convictions, andinfluences, of their interpretations, of the resulting ascription of valueand meaning to the objects of perception which an individual canmuster. The world image is, in a very concrete and immediate sense,the outcome of communication... (suggestion). It is not a world, but amosaic of single images which may be interpreted in one way todayand differently tomorrow; a pattern of patterns; an interpretation ofinterpretations; the result of incessant decisions about what may andwhat may not be included in these meta-interpretations, which them-selves are the consequences of past decisions.— P. Watzlawick, 1978NEGATIVE BELIEFSSome people are very much like soft, plush, wall-to-wall carpeting:They tend to keep the imprints of those people who walked on them inthe past. Once this happens, these \"imprints\" (belief systems) supple-ment, and in many cases, supplant so-called reality. When an individu-al's \"mosaic of single images\" is continually interpreted in a stereotypedway, he becomes stuck, and his range of choices is limited. If his beliefsystems tell him that no one likes him, or she always fails, s/he may con-tinue to distort or deny reality to support his \"world image.\" If we againexamine a traditional version of hypnosis (hypnotic belief systems)which holds that hypnosis is the communication of ideas and attitudesthat take a firm hold on an individual's inner belief systems and then leadthat individual to respond to the \"implanted suggestions,\" we can seemore clearly the relationship between hypnotic phenomena and beliefsystems. The child who is told to never say no, or that he should not tryto be better than his elders, may grow up and act on those suggestions asBelief Systems49if they were absolute laws—part of the Ten Commandments. That person\"knows\" that any violation of such commandments will bring great harmand pain. Now, that's not true in reality, but it is true in that person'sinner world—based on his belief systems. That person is operating underthe hypnotic phenomenon known as \"negative hallucination\" that leadshim to continually deny external information that would prove that hisbelief systems are not necessarily accurate. Instead, he continues to besad, miserable and depressed because his inner belief systems hypnotizehim into following the very steps that cause those \"suggestions\" to bearthat sour fruition.Several years ago, a psychiatrist and I were discussing one of hispatients. The psychiatrist was frustrated because he \"knew\" he could helpthe patient, \"but nothing is happening.\" He told me he could really help ifonly his patient was more psychologically astute, more aware, moremotivated, and could really understand the \"real\" purpose of therapy. Ireplied, \"If your patient had all those skills readily available, he sure ashell wouldn't need you! Have you considered working with the patientyou have instead of the one you are dreaming about?\" The moral of thatstory is this: If an individual were capable of instantly being the way atherapist wants them to be, they wouldn't be in the therapist's office inthe first place. Since that individual has sought help, it is a safe bet toassume that s/he is stuck—at least in some aspect of his/her life. I believethat one of the first and, perhaps, most important tasks at hand, is to dis-cover what keeps that individual from having new choices that wouldlead to being \"unstuck.\" To make those discoveries, it is my belief thatyou must examine their belief systems. Once you begin to understand(better yet, recognize) which belief systems are keeping them stuck, youmust then begin to work with the individual you have and not the oneyou may have hallucinated. Using the individual's known—and perhaps,painful—belief systems to lead them to new destinations, is a gracefulway to bring about change.INDUCTION VIA BELIEF SYSTEMDuring one of my training seminars, a young psychologist wasunhappy because he \"couldn't\" be hypnotized. He said he had really triedto cooperate, but to no avail; that he could still \"hear everything the otherPerson was saying,\" and that \"nothing different had happened.\" Afterasking him to sit down in front of the training group, I asked him thefollowing: \"I guess you have a pretty good idea of what a person should"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"Monsters & Magical SticksBelief Systemsbe saying to you in order to hypnotize you properly, don't you?\" Henodded his head yes and said, \"I think I do.\" I replied, \"Since we are allhere to learn, I would like to know what would need to happen to you tolet you know you were in a hypnotic state?\" He named several possibili-ties including arm catalepsy. I emphasized his choice (belief system) bysaying, \"Do you mean that you believe that arm catalepsy is one way youwould know you are in hypnosis?\" He replied, \"That's right! Abso-lutely!\" I then asked him to do me a \"personal\" favor and close his eyes,which he did. I then told him that no matter what I said he should ignoremy remarks, and instead listen to his own inner voice saying the \"proper\"words. He nodded his head, and I began saying a few unimportant things,such as \"you continue just as you are\" and \"that's right...even moreslowly\" (timed to his breathing). After a few more such comments, Isaid, \"and keep on listening to your own inner voice.\" With that I shutup. After three or four minutes I took his right wrist gently and began toslowly raise his right arm straight out in front of him, and then held itthere for about 30 seconds. I then slowly let go. His arm remained whereit was, and, after almost five minutes, he opened his eyes. He looked athis still \"cataleptic\" arm and said, \"I'll be damned! I did it!\"The above is an example of using an individual's unique belief sys-tem to help him experience change. In this case, the individual's beliefsystems were used to produce what he wanted, but was failing toachieve: being hypnotized! When he stated that he could still hear theother person's voice and that nothing different had happened, he hadused words that described one of his maps, but not necessarily the \"real\"world. His map told him that he shouldn't hear the \"hypnotist's\" voice. I,therefore, asked him to hear his own voice, and I just stopped talking. Inaddition, I used what he considered \"something different happening\"—arm catalepsy—to help him alter his state. Arguing with his belief sys-tems, or continuing to do what had already not worked, only more of it,and better (?) would probably have resulted in a more entrenched indi-vidual. You may wish..now...to utilize the above example as a guidetoward developing some creative new approaches to those patients whoare \"resistant\" and/or \"intractable.\"If, as I believe, belief systems and the responses that flow from themare almost hypnotic in nature, then using this thing that doesn't exist—hypnosis—to help give individuals a new map, may be, in effect, usingwhat they already know to help them learn and experience somethingnew. Where we fail to do this (use what they know), we may run the riskof encouraging the individual to continue to respond to his old beliefsystems automatically, and to deny the possibility of change. The indi-vidual's response may have become so automated that the source, ororiginal purpose of the response is \"lost\" from conscious awareness.Young (1978), starting from a different place, and perhaps going some-where else, said:All learning action conies essentially from within, as a result of theoperation of the programs, part inherited, part acquired. These pro-grams co-operate with the signals coming from the sense organs, buteven these are not simply imposed on us. What we see and hear islargely the result of our programs of search, some of them followinghabitual rhythms.Just as the hypnotic subject will respond to the \"six growling dogs\"automatically based on the hypnotic \"cue\" being presented, so too willindividuals tend to associate certain external stimuli (cues) with certainstereotyped responses. The external \"cue\" becomes a symbol, ormetaphor, that sets into motion a whole series of responses, as if theindividual was carrying out a post-hypnotic suggestion. Young (cited)put that idea this way...the key to the concept as we are using it is that a symbol is aspecial sort of signal because it represents the features of the surround-ings in such a way that the organism immediately recognizes its signifi-cance and acts accordingly.... So the programs of the brain symbolizethe environment in the sense that they provide actions that correspondto, or represent it. Some of the programs do this because of heredity andmany of them are built up by the results of experience of the environ-ment recorded in the memory.ERICKSON — BELIEFS — METAPHORSIn 1979, I had the pleasure of spending two days with Dr. MiltonErickson at his home in Phoenix, Arizona. At one point, I asked Dr.Erickson the following question: \"Would you say that you perceive allpresenting symptoms and complaints as being metaphors that contain astory about the 'real' problem, and that your basic approach is to buildmetaphors that contain a story about the possible solution?\" Dr. Erick-son's face lit up and, like a little boy finding a surprise, he said,Exactly!\" One of my most important beliefs is that individuals' belief"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"Monsters & Magical Stickssystems are metaphors; that the individual operates and respondsmetaphorically to the world! It takes metaphoric approaches to helpexpand each individual's choices.After the odyssey through the Magic Theater, the hero in HermanHesse's Steppenwolf laughs out loud as he realizes that reality is noth-ing but the free choice of one of many doors that are open at all times.— P. Watzlawick, citedOnce an individual discovers 31 flavors of ice cream, he will find itdifficult to insist that there is only vanilla. I hope to point out throughoutthis book that hypnosis is, itself, a very powerful metaphoric state; thatthe problem itself is a metaphor based on old belief systems that wereproduced by conditions that could be labeled hypnosis. It would seemlogical, therefore, to grasp and use this powerful tool called hypnosis tohelp build new, graceful and efficacious metaphors. These newmetaphors will then be directed toward new choices and responses to the\"real\" world. Paul Watzlawick (cited) approaching the same destinationfrom a different direction stated:The aim of realistic, responsible therapy can only be increased skillin dealing with life's problems as they arise, but not a problem-free life.VISystems TwoEXCESS BAGGAGEIt is 2:00 a.m. and a man is disembarking from an airplane. He isabout to start a vacation in a place he has never been. Excited about hisnew journey, he makes his way to the baggage area and waits. Within ashort time, his baggage arrives. He looks for a porter to help him, but noluck. He takes his baggage and begins making his way through the air-port. Only then does he realize that he is carrying excess baggage. As hewalks through the winding corridors, the weight of the baggage beginsslowing him down. Slowly his excitement fades and is replaced withfrustration and fatigue. Each step becomes more painful, and his shoul-ders cry out from the strain. Soon, each step is agony; he watches hisfeet, listens to his footsteps, and feels the weight even more. By the timehe reaches the airport exit, he is exhausted. What a dumb way to begin ajourney. There is, however, one thing that is dumber. If he continues tocarry excessive baggage when he knows how dumb that is.Most therapists, and particularly those who use hypnosis, often makethe therapeutic journey a painful one. They do this as a result of theexcess and often useless baggage they carry with them. By the time theyfinish their trip, they and their patients are frustrated and fatigued. Thebaggage I refer to is that of old belief systems and preconceived ideas asto how people think, experience and communicate. Those of you whohave read the fine books written by John Grinder and Richard Bandler(particularly The Structure of Magic II) will be familiar with what youwill now be reading. However, stick with it, as there will be additionalinformation and subtleties for you to consider. The rest of you may findthe information hard to believe. Read on, for you are about to begin anew journey.53"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"54Monsters & Magical SticksOne piece of excess baggage we could all do without is the\"assumption\" that all individuals, more or less, think and process infor-mation in a similar fashion. Nothing could be more removed from reality.It is true that we all use our \"senses\"—eyes, ears, nose, touch, etc.—to\"know\" the world around us. It is not true that we do so in the same wayas everyone else. We not only process information in unique ways, wealso express our experiences to others in unique ways. The words we useare, in fact, metaphors for our individual responses and experiences. Forpeople-helpers, or for anyone who is interested in meaningful communi-cation, it is imperative that we know how to translate another'smetaphors.Let us pretend that you and I are walking along a beautiful beachtogether. We are deep into our individual experience. Our \"senses\" aretaking in the external experience. We smell the salt air, feel the warmthof the sun, and see the beautiful blue sky. Unconsciously, each of us isprocessing all of this input. This processing will be based on our pastexperiences, belief systems, expectations and values as to a beach. Weeach will become consciously aware of all or a portion of our processing.If we sit down together to discuss our experience, we each will findcertain words coming into our mind that describes the experience forourselves. We each may \"assume\" that the other has the same words andexperienced the same things. Of such \"assumptions\" rotten communica-tions are born.CONSCIOUS OUTPUT SYSTEMI would like you to consider the words we use to communicate ourinternal experiences to another person as our conscious output system:that is, how we attempt to communicate our experiences to another afterwe have become \"aware\" of the experiences. Most of us tend to\"assume\" that our output system is the same as everyone else's. Expertsin the field of language, and those who specialize in brain hemispherics,have \"discovered\" that this is not the case. By the time an individual isabout eleven or twelve years old, they have developed a preferred outputsystem. This system indicates which part of the individual's experienceshe tends to make most important—at least consciously. These \"output\"systems come in three varieties: Visual—Kinesthetic—Auditory. It hasbeen estimated that 40% of the population, at least in the United States,tend to prefer a visual system for expressing their experiences to another.These individuals tend to use highly visual words such as, \"I see whatSystems Two55you mean,\" \"That looks good to me,\" \"I am still not clear as to outputsystems. Could you show me an example?\"There is a second 40% of the population that tends to prefer a kines-thetic \"output\" system in communication to others. They tend to use suchphrases as, \"This is hard for me to grasp,\" \"I want to get a handle on it,\"\"Hey! It is starting to fall into place.\" In short, these individuals tend tofeel it is important to put out information in a firm and solid manner soyou can get a hold of it. Last, but not least, there is another 20% whotend to prefer an auditory \"output\" system. These individuals tend to usemany words so as to insure understanding. In addition, they use phrasessuch as, \"That sounds all right to me,\" \"It is starting to ring a bell,\" \"Iwant to buzz you with an idea. Let me know if it sounds exactly right.\"OUTPUT SYSTEM: THE BEACHLet us return to the beach for a few moments. If we were to ask a\"visual\" individual what s/he liked about the beach, we might hear thefollowing: \"I like watching the waves and the beautiful sky. You can seethe people really having a good time, and besides, when I get a tan, Ilook good.\" If we asked the same question of a \"kinesthetic\" person, s/hemight say, \"I really enjoy the warmth. I can feel the tension drop away. Itreally makes me feel loose and tingly all over.\" An auditory mightrespond: \"I really like the sound of the waves crashing down. It is muchquieter, and I can really hear myself think.\"On the other hand, a \"visual\" might say, \"I really love looking at thebeach, and the beautiful blue water. It makes me feel good.\" While s/heended with a \"kinesthetic\" phrase, s/he arrived there via a visual path. A\"kinesthetic\" might say, \"I really loosen up when I come to the beach. Ifeel calm and can take time to see what is going on.\" S/he ended with avisual statement, but moved firmly through \"kinesthetic\" to get there.The \"Auditory\" individual could say, \"It is so quiet at the beach. I havetime to sound out new ideas. I can look at the people and feel calm.\"At this point, some of you may be a bit incredulous. You may bethinking, \"I use all those systems.\" That is true...and not true...at thesame time. A right-handed person uses his/her left hand, but tends to relyon the right hand more often than the left.Individuals who tend to be highly visual also use kinesthetic andauditory phrases. However, if you pay attention, you will begin to seeclearly that they paint verbal pictures. They will show you what theywant you to see. If you were to ask a visual person to \"put a handle\" on"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"Monsters & Magical Sticks ' ''Systems Two57something, they will tend to get a picture of a handle. They will then waitfor you to tell them where to put \"it\" (careful...).An individual who happens to be highly kinesthetic will also usevisual and auditory phases. When you really get in touch with what theyare doing, you will find that they are trying to give you their feeling forthings. They would like you to really get a hold of what they are givingyou.The auditory person can fool you. My experience has been that theyhave a very highly developed second system. That second system may beeither visual or kinesthetic. Again, if you really listen, you will hear whattheir preferred system is. They will tend to use many words to describetheir feelings (kinesthetic) or to make a picture.In any case, if you will get rid of the excessive baggage of a closedmind, I believe you will have an exciting new journey. By \"paying atten-tion\" and \"tuning in\" and \"getting a hold of things,\" you will discover theindividual's preferred system. You may even enjoy finding what your\"output\" system is.At this point, I would like to recommend a little caution. It has beenrepresented by many \"systems\" experts that a visual person is alwaysprimarily visual, a kinesthetic remains kinesthetic, and once an auditory,always an auditory. I do not agree with that conclusion. My experiencehas been that an individual may be primarily kinesthetic in one set ofexperiences and circumstances, visual in another set of circumstancesand experiences, and auditory in other experiences and circumstances. Ialso believe that where the individual functions gracefully, s/he will tendto utilize all systems more or less equally—with one system a little moreequal. Conversely, I believe that you will find a different story in theareas of dysfunction. In those areas, as a general rule, you will find thatthe individual is more or less \"stuck\" on one system. Think now, of thetypical \"depressed\" patient. In almost all cases they will be not onlystuck in kinesthetic, but in a painful kinesthetic system. You, the reader,might be wondering what does all of \"this\" have to do with hypnosis andtherapy? Relax, feel comfortable, begin to see the picture, and listen. Weare moving toward those areas now.HEAR THE FEELING OF THE PICTUREThe way in which we experience something visually is entirely dif-ferent from the experience of feeling \"it,\" which is different from theexperience of hearing it. Think of each one of the conscious outputsystems as a \"person\" within us. Where these \"persons\" are working inpartnership, we will tend to have more than enough choices available tous. If, however, we are only using one of the \"partners\"—e.g., the audi-tory system to solve a problem, and that \"partner\" does not have theanswer we may be in trouble. We may continue to follow our own foot-steps in a continuous circle.Since it is easier to describe a telephone when you are holding onethan it is to describe one when you have never experienced a telephone, Iwould like to paint a picture for those who need to see. For those who arestill trying to grasp it, let me give you something to hold on to. Ofcourse those of you who need to hear it, can read the words. If we wereto take' the experience of summer and describe it visually, we might say,\"I love seeing the blue skies, the beautiful green trees, all the brightcolors of the flowers.\" If we were then to describe the feelings of sum-mer we could talk about \"the warm sun, the feeling of a soft summerbreeze, the feelings of peace and tranquillity.\" That would be a very dif-ferent description of summer than the first one. If we went on to describethe sounds of summer, we could say, \"I like the sounds of the ocean, thesounds of birds singing, and the rustling sound the trees make in a sum-mer breeze.\" That is a third way of describing the experience of summer.Each one of those ways is, in and of itself, incomplete and impoverished.None of those descriptions would be as complete as a description thatincludes all three: \"Ah, I love summer. It feels so warm and relaxing. Isee so many bright colors of the flowers, and the sky is beautiful. I lovethe sounds of summer, too. Birds singing, and at the beach, the sound ofthe ocean is so soothing.\" Now, we have a multisensory \"Gestalt\"description of summer. Each one of our \"partners\"—or systems—has aunique way of experiencing the world around us. Because of each\"partner's\" specialization, each system has a different way of responding,and of solving problems.At my Clinical Hypnosis: Innovative Technique® seminars, Iattempt to \"show\" people just how different our responses can be,depending on our \"systems.\" I will pick three people from the group,having discovered what their preferred system is. I end up with one ofeach, unless I goof. I ask the \"visual\" to hold out his right hand. I thenask him to get the feeling of warmth in \"that\" hand. Many are unable toaccomplish that task at all. Some do so, but with observable effort. I willthen ask him to look up and get a clear picture of the sun on a warm day.en he signals (nods his head) that he has done so, I say, \"Now, reach"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"Monsters & Magical Sticksup with your hand and see the sun warming your hand. When you feelthe warmth lower your hand.\" Usually, within ten seconds, he will lowerhis hand and acknowledge that he feels the warmth.I then ask the \"kinesthetic\" to look up and get a clear picture of thesun. She will have a great deal of difficulty, and, in most cases, will beunable to \"get the picture.\" I will then instruct her as follows: \"I wouldlike you to hold your right hand out in front of you, about waist high.Now, I would like you to remember what a warm, moist hand feels like.When you have that feeling in that hand, just nod.\" When she nods(usually within a few seconds), I then say, \"Now, slowly lift that handstraight up, taking all those warm feelings with it. When you get it up,build a firm picture of the warm sun that will match the feelings.\" Withinseconds she will nod.With the \"auditory,\" I will attempt to ascertain which system is nottheir second system. For our example, let us assume his second system iskinesthetic. I will ask him to get a picture, just as with the visual. He willhave great difficulty. I will then tell him, \"I would like you to rememberthe sound the waves make as they crash down.\" When he nods, I con-tinue: \"Now, as you hear the waves, I want you to remember the warmthof the sand and see yourself putting that hand into the sand. When youfeel the warmth in your hand, slowly raise that hand and build a pictureof the sun.\" He, too, will find himself successful. Each one ends up beingsuccessful, but each one takes a different road.You could stop now, and take a small break. During that break, youcould begin to wonder how the above examples might have importantramifications for the areas of communication, therapy and hypnosis.CASE 3: SYSTEMS FOR INDUCTIONNow that you have had a \"wondering\" break, I would like to giveyou an example from my clinical practice. A colleague of mine, a physi-cian, asked me to consult with a patient. This patient was sufferingintractable pain throughout his back. He had been hospitalized for aseries of tests. The tests had revealed that he had terminal cancer, but hehad not been informed of the findings at that point. When I met with thepatient, he made statements such as, \"It hurts. I feel torn up by the pain. Ican't stand up to the pain much longer.\" By his output systems (words), Iknew he was, at least in his present experience, kinesthetic. I asked himwhat he, in the past, had found peaceful and relaxing. \"Sailing,\" hereplied, and his face relaxed slightly. I then asked him what he likedSystems Two59about sailing. His reply was most informative. \"I like the sound the boatmakes going through the water, and the rippling sound the sails makewhen you have a good wind.\" With those brief remarks, he had told mewhat system he used to reach the feelings of relaxation and peacefulness.I asked him to close his eyes and remember the sound of rain hitting awindow. After a few moments, I asked him to remember the sound ofcrackling fire. When I could see the signs of relaxation (deeper breathing,facial muscles relaxing), I asked him to \"see\" the flames as he listened tothe sounds of the warm relaxing fire. I then said, \"As you begin to feelthe peaceful warmth of the fire, your whole body knows how to remem-ber all the pleasure. Then you might want to see yourself sailing.\" Therewas now evidence of deep relaxation. After several more requests by mefor auditory memories leading to kinesthetic experiences, he had enteredhypnosis.CASE 3: SYSTEMS — PAIN REDUCTIONThe technique described above is an updated version of a very oldhypnotic technique. \"Old time\" hypnotists knew that if you helped anindividual to use their \"imagining,\" they could control or eliminate pain.They were utilizing systems, without knowing what it is they reallyknew. I would like to give you the basic tools that will help you toaccomplish the same end.Where you have an individual who is in physical pain, whether froman accident or illness, that person will be very much into their kinestheticsystem. The goal is to help them move into another system; e.g., visual.This will help them to actually utilize a different area of the brain fromthe part that controls pain. When you have accomplished that switch,their perception of pain drops while their perception of comfort in-creases. To put it to you in another way: You are helping them to use adifferent system for the \"expression\" of their problem (pain). One way ofproducing that result is to ask the \"pain patient\" to make a \"picture\" ofwhat the pain would look like. For example, a woman was complainingof a severe headache in my office. She said that it was so bad that shedidn't think we could continue our session. I asked her to close her eyes,and see what color her headache was. She looked at me as if I was crazy.Of course, she was right. I just get paid well for it. Finally, she shruggedher shoulders and closed her eyes. After a short time, she informed methat she did have a picture of colors, and that \"it seems to be bright redsand oranges.\" I then instructed her to listen to the steady sound of her"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"6oMonsters & Magical Sticks Systems Two61breathing, and with each exhalation, she would breathe more and more ofthose colors out of her system. She was told to continue until she couldsee it \"all\" across the room, as if a painting hanging on the wall. It wasseveral minutes before she signaled that the picture was on the wall. Iasked her to see someone walking into the room, taking the picture offthe wall, and to hear that person's footsteps as he walked out of theroom. In less than five minutes she terminated the hypnotic state that shehad spontaneously achieved, with the headache gone.From what you have just read, I know that you can see and graspfirmly the concept that each system has a different way of \"expressing\"itself. If an individual is unable to \"solve\" a problem—pain in the aboveexample—you, as a people-helper, can help him/her utilize a differentsystem. In the areas of \"emotional pain,\" perhaps \"looking\" in a new waymay help him/her to see a solution. Perhaps \"listening\" or \"grasping\"something new might do the trick. Changing the \"pain patient's\" kines-thetic system to a visual one will almost always do the trick. I have usedthat method with severe burn patients, cancer patients, and for surgeriesin which anesthesia could not be used. You could...TRYIT YOURSELF.You may be very pleased.SYSTEM MISMATCH: EXERCISERecently, while dining at a restaurant, I overheard a conversationbetween a well-known actress and her two companions, one of whomwas evidently her producer. She was describing her last few days as\"being uptight.\" She made statements such as, \"I've really been tied upin knots; the stress of our shooting schedule is crushing me; I finally hada good night's sleep; I just floated off and woke up this morning feelinglighter; I have decided to stay loose.\" The producer listened politely andthen responded, \"You should see the rushes. You look great. We have agood product and when they see it they will be impressed.\" As the pro-ducer talked, the actress began to look annoyed and then bored, and then,totally uninterested. As soon as the producer finished, she turned to herother companion and began talking with animation. She hardly said twowords to the producer from that point on. Here was a beautiful exampleof how not to communicate. If I had not been aware of the subject oftheir conversation, it would have sounded like two disjointed and sepa-rate conversations.Becoming aware of the output system of the people around you maybe the beginning of a very exciting adventure. To help you to take thattrio I would like to give you an exercise that you can choose to go outand enjoy doing, or you can just do it and then choose to enjoy it. Youcan even choose not to choose to do it. That is also your choice. In publicplaces such as restaurants, listen to and watch the people around you. Payattention to the fact that some people will paint vivid pictures with theirwords. If they are describing a trip to the mountains, they may use wordsthat describe what the mountains looked like. As they talk, some mayeven paint a picture by the movement of their hands. Another person maydescribe the same subject by the feelings of the experience. \"I felt socalm and relaxed in the mountains, and the soft mountain breeze reallyfelt good.\" As they talk, their hand gestures will be that of \"getting intouch\" with something; contact to their own body; touching their chestareas; contact with the other person. The auditory will tend to talk abouthow the mountains sound to him. They may use many words to describethe experience in detail. Even when they are describing the feelings orsomething visual, they will tend to use many words. Some people mayfool you at first. As you really tune in, you will grasp their system moreeasily and see clearly how different those systems are. Keep in mind thateach system is important and that no system is \"better\" than another, andthat all of the systems exist within us.After you have practiced listening to the people around you, and arebecoming comfortable in recognizing their (preferred) output system,you are ready for the next step. You can now begin to take a more activerole in discovering their preferred output system. In general conversa-tions, you can begin to ask neutral questions, such as, \"What does com-fort mean to you?\" or \"What did you enjoy most on your vacation?\" Toquestions phrased in that manner, a kinesthetic might reply, \"I feel loose,relaxed, without pressure,\" or \"It really felt good to get away. I could feelthe everyday stress fall away.\" A visual, in responding to the questionabout comfort, might say something like, \"I see myself in a beautifulpiece where the sky is blue, and everything looks peaceful.\" To thequestion about their vacation, the visual might respond, \"Wow! Thescenery was great. There was so much to see.\" In any case, you will bepleasantly surprised to discover the differences. Be careful when you areasking these questions, however. If you ask someone, \"Can you describewhat the mountains looked like to you?\" you will, in most cases, get a\"visual\" answer. Through \"demand characteristics\" you are asking themto switch to a visual system. \"How did you feel on your vacation\""},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"62Monsters & Magical Sticksdemands a kinesthetic response. Most individuals, unless they are understress, are flexible enough to \"switch.\"Let us suppose a person enters a therapist's office and says that theyare suffering from depression. S/he goes on to say that s/he is beingcrushed by his/her feelings, and is really feeling down. S/he is, at thatmoment in his/her life, stuck in the kinesthetic system. S/he is in pain,which is a kinesthetic experience. As long as s/he continues to stay inthat system, the problem will remain. If the kinesthetic system containedchoices s/he could easily use to be more comfortable, I believe s/hewould have made that choice. As you begin to help that person step backand look at what is going on in his/her life, you are helping him/her to\"switch\" systems. This often leads to \"seeing\" different choices.Switching an individual from their conscious output system will oftenresult in that state that does not exist...hypnosis. In addition, it helps theindividual \"use\" another part of their brain from the part that is causingthe \"problem.\" In effect, you help them to break their \"mind set,\" andenable them to call upon another \"partner,\" or system, for the solving oftheir problem.CASE 4: SYSTEMS — DEPRESSIONA woman entered my office in what I could best describe as a\"crushed\" state. She sat slumped in a chair, and used one kinestheticphrase after another to describe the state of her life and being. Usingkinesthetic phrases, I asked her to really get in touch with those feelings,and to hold them. She was instructed to close her eyes and to really feelall the feelings, with particular effort to be made experiencing her physi-cal sensations. This part of the procedure began a process of directing herattention away from her emotional state to that of her physical state.Next, she was told to feel her mind beginning to build a clear picture ofwhat all those feelings would look like. I said, \"The picture you get maybe colors, or some situation, it may look sensible or nonsensical.\"Within a few minutes, her breathing rate had deepened and her gen-eral demeanor was much improved. Several minutes later she began tolaugh, and stated, \"I have a picture but it doesn't make any sense. In factit looks ridiculous.\" I said, \"You now have several choices as to how todeal with that picture\"—an implied suggestion that there were options inreaching a new solution. \"You can either remember the sound of thewind and see the picture being blown further and further away until youcan see a beautiful sky. In that clear sky is a bright warm sun, and youSystems Twocan soon feel all that warmth and comfort.\" This last statement offeredher the option of moving back to her kinesthetic system, but now in apleasurable way. This would result in a basic restructuring of her kines-thetic experience. \"Another choice you have is to question some objector person in your picture. If you do so, listen first to the sound of thatvoice, and then the words, until it is clear to you.\"She chose the second method, and within five minutes she openedher eyes with a start. She informed me that she now knew what wasbothering her. I asked her to again close her eyes, which she did. I thensaid, \"I would like you to let your creative unconscious mind produce anew picture. This picture will be from some time in your past when youfelt stuck in a similar situation, but where you had found a solution. Iwould like you to then watch that part of you as she updates that solutionto fit your present situation until it looks just right. Then wait until whatyou see feels good and strong, and you experience those feelings now.\" Itwas nearly ten minutes more before she opened her eyes. She smiled andsaid, \"I'm not sure what happened, but I feel very good.\" I then asked herto practice changing any uncomfortable feelings into pictures, just as shehad done in my office. Two days later her husband called. He told methat his wife was happier and more relaxed than he had seen her inmonths, and that \"she even looks and acts younger.\" The procedure asdescribed was not a cure, but it was a giant step in the direction of newchoices.SYSTEMS: RAPPORTAn important and practicable application of the use of output systemsconcerns the establishment of rapport. Meeting someone in \"their sys-tem\" establishes rapport almost instantly, and improves rapport withthose people you are now interacting with. In addition, being able tocommunicate in another's system can help you to quickly make a con-nection to the so-called emergency patient. The following example willmake those points clearly.A young man had been referred to three different therapists by hisphysician. He had been given three names because he was doubtful thathe could find a therapist who could help. The young man had been in adeep depression for several months, and his physician considered himsuicidal. He had been in therapy two years prior to his present\"outbreak,\" but with little success."},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"64Monsters & Magical SticksAt this point, he was feeling totally hopeless. Mine was one of thethree names he had been given. When he called me, I listened carefullyto the way he expressed himself. Some of the statements he made were,\"I feel crushed by my problems; I don't know if I can stand up to it muchlonger; I know I'm going to collapse soon.\" To his (kinesthetic) state-ments, I responded, \"It must be rough trying to carry that burden your-self. You must get really down from the struggle. I would like you toreach down and grasp just enough strength to get in to my office. I reallyfeel that if we get together and tackle this problem, we will be able topound out a solution. Once you get a handle on things, the weight willfall away.\" He responded, \"Thank God! I finally found somebody whounderstands my problem.\" Now, I had no idea what his \"real\" problemwas. I knew that he was stuck in one system, at least as to his presentproblem. I needed to meet him in that system before I could even beginto lead him out. Rapport was established, on the phone, within a fewminutes. He kept his appointment, and within a few sessions he wasbeginning to \"look\" for new solutions, and was beginning to \"see\" thingsthat needed to be \"clarified.\"Let us recap together. What you have been reading describes theconscious output system: How an individual communicates in their ownconscious mind (internal dialogue) as well as to the listener, what theirpresent experience is. I hope you have a clear picture as to what thevisual system is. I have made every effort to paint a clear picture for you.I also want you to grasp the concept of the kinesthetic system. I feel con-fident that you will get comfortable with it. For those of you who areauditory, you could read all the words again until they sound right andring true. Keep in mind also, that in helping someone to use all theirsystems, you help them to discover new choices. Within each system isinformation that may include a solution: information they may haveheard, something they may have seen, or a time they responded withdifferent feelings in a similar situation.Among all of their systems there is an answer. However, where anindividual is only relying on one system and is stuck, they are, in effect,excluding from their conscious awareness at least two-thirds of theirhistory and experiences. If that is the case, it is not surprising that theyare in pain. What is surprising is how well they have done in spite oftheir self-imposed handicap.VIIGIGONow that you have mastered, and are comfortable with, output sys-tems, you are ready to continue your journey. We will now move into thearea of internal systems, processes and programs. This part of your jour-ney will help you to understand just how an individual generates theinternal experiences that lead to the conscious output. Before we actuallybegin, we need to take a side trip to a computer room.As you enter the computer room, you may be overwhelmed by theapparent complexity of the computer itself. If you will, think of thatcomputer as a sophisticated shovel: in short, a tool to be directed by you.The computer has been designed with certain built-in characteristics andcapabilities. All it does is make calculations at an incredibly rapid rate.However, if the \"programmer\" creates a poor program, then what comesout will be \"garbage.\" This process is also known as \"GIGO,\" which iscomputer-eze for \"garbage in/garbage out.\" Even where the program thatis \"punched in\" is OK, you still may get garbage out when thecomputer's internal programs (such as its \"start-up\" program or operatingsystem) are not operating properly.If you were to consider the computer's communications—e.g., avisual display—as its output system, you could then consider theprogrammer's data and information as the system's input. You could goone step further and consider its built-in capacity and programs as a sortof \"unseen\" and \"unknown\" system that is, in fact, central to thecomputer's \"functioning and well-being.\" You may want to draw aparallel between the way people process their programs and what youhave been reading. If so, good. Read on and the parallels will becomeeven more clear, and important."},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"66Monsters & Magical SticksUNCONSCIOUS INPUT SYSTEMAs you have already discovered, the way an individual communi-cates with words indicates what their conscious output system is. Whatmay be even more important is the \"programs\" they use to generate theirconscious experience. I term this system the unconscious input system.\"Unconscious,\" because, in the majority of situations, the individual isnot consciously aware of what they are doing. \"Input,\" because it is as ifit is a \"program\" for the processing of their experiences. Where an indi-vidual is responding to a \"here-and-now\" experience with here-and-nowresponses, his/her unconscious input system plays but a small part. How-ever, if individuals always responded in a \"here-and-now\" manner, theywould probably have little or no need to be therapized. In the areas oftheir \"dysfunction,\" it is a safe bet that they are responding to somethingother than the \"here-and-now.\" Where their input system is a GIGO sys-tem, what comes out will draw flies.Let us digress for a moment. Earlier I referred to a walk along thebeach. In such a situation, most of us would be responding to the beach.Our senses and responses would not only be engaged in the experience ofthe beach, we would also be pretty much conscious of the majority of ourexperience. If someone were to ask you to remember the first time youwent to a beach, you would then go to your unconscious input system:that is, you would use a certain \"program\" for finding that memorywithin you. A trained observer could know by just what method yougenerated that memory. This observer would know your \"program\" bywhat you did with your eyes. In 1969, a gentleman by the name of Bakandiscovered a relationship between eye movement and hemispheric recall.His work, along with the works of many others, has established specificrelationships between eye position and movement, and the type of\"recall\" the individual is experiencing. This \"recall\" may be visual,kinesthetic, auditory, or combinations of all three. Where the individual'sunconscious input (recall) system is GIGO, then s/he will experience alot of garbage.For example, what if we were to ask a friend how he was going to doon a job interview? As he begins to respond, he makes a \"picture\" out ofhis past. Let us assume that this picture is one in which he made a fool ofhimself at a grade school recital. Let us further assume that this picture ismainly unconscious. There is a very good chance that he will experiencesome bad feelings. He will probably assume that the prospect of theGIGOinterview is causing them. He may then say, \"I am really scared. I alwaysscrew up at interviews.\" If you could help him become aware of the\"real\" source of his fear, you could help him to have a new choice. If heis not so helped, he will continue to hypnotize himself into responding tointerviews \"as if\" he was a kid in grade school, and he will probablyhave amnesia for the picture he is \"really\" seeing. At this point youmight be thinking, \"Sounds great! But how do I go about it?\" As youcontinue your journey, you will discover the how of it.THE EYES HAVE ITFor you to understand another's unconscious (input) system, youmust first learn what different eye movements and positions mean. Iwould like you to imagine a face looking at you, or if it will help, draw aface on a piece of paper. Next, I want you to pretend that the wholeworld is right-handed/left-hemispheric dominant. Now, of course, that isnot even close to true; we will explore the variations as we continue.Now, go back to the imagined face or the one you have drawn. I wouldlike you to \"see\" the eyes turning up to that \"person's\" left—your right,as you look at them.Where an individual is looking up to their left, s/he is triggering thatpart of the brain in which PAST VISUAL memories are stored. Anotherway of stating that would be: S/he is seeing something s/he has seen inhis/her history. When that individual looks up to the right—your left asyou look at them—they are CONSTRUCTING VISUAL images: that is,s/he is making a picture of a new idea, understanding or something theyhave never seen before. For example, if you were to ask someone to get aclear picture of an elephant, they would, in the vast majority of cases,look up to their left. After they \"got the picture\" (which could be within asplit second), they would then look back at you.In many cases, they would also nod their head slightly. If you thenasked him/her to get a clear picture of the colors red and orange, theywould again look up to the left. If you then asked them to get a clearpicture of a red and orange polka-dotted elephant, they would look up tothe right. (They might first look briefly up to the left to \"recall\" eachpiece, before looking to the right.) S/he would look up to the rightbecause, hopefully, they have not experienced one of those in their realworld of the past. (If they have, please give them my card.)Be aware and forewarned! Some, and perhaps most individuals, willmake it easy for you. Their eye movements will be very pronounced. A"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"68Monsters & Magical SticksGIGO69few individuals will have eye movements that are very quick and mini-mal. Practice... You will \"see\" it almost intuitively.When, in response to a question or in any other situation, an individ-ual looks down to their left—your right as you look at them—they are, atthat moment, into their internal AUDITORY SYSTEM. In effect, they arehaving an internal dialogue. They may be rehearsing what they are aboutto say, or re-hearing a past conversation or any previous auditory experi-ence. Another possibility is that they are \"analyzing\" something theyhave heard or wish to say.When an individual looks down to their right—your left as you lookat them—s/he is recalling PAST KINESTHETIC EXPERIENCES. As youobserve that person, you will often see evidence of their kinestheticexperience: facial color changes; bottom lip becoming fuller; changes inbreathing rate. As a general rule, when someone is experiencing a presentkinesthetic experience, s/he will tend to look in the general direction ofthe listener and make physical contact to their own body. It is when thatindividual is attempting to recall a past experience of \"feelings\" that theindividual will look down to their right.PREFERRED UNCONSCIOUS SYSTEMIn our discussion of conscious output systems, I attempted to pointout that, while we use all systems, we also tend to have one system that ispreferred. This is also the general rule for our unconscious input system.(As you read on, you will find that the exceptions are as frequent as therule.) As you begin to observe the people around you, I am confident thatyou will \"see\" that each individual tends to utilize one unconscious sys-tem far more than the others. Some individuals will, in the vast majorityof situations, make reference to their unconscious visual system. Whenasked a question, or when they are trying to recover information, theywill invariably move their eyes up, usually to their left. This movementindicates that they are finding \"the picture.\" Some individuals will almostalways move their eyes down right when searching for past information.In effect, they are trying to grab hold of, and get the feeling of the infor-mation. A few individuals will look first down to their left in searchingfor information, or recalling a past experience. This tells you that theyare using words as their \"program\" for recall.By paying attention to eye movements, you, as a communicator, as apeople-helper, and as a person who cares, will gain a great deal of infor-mation. You will know just how an individual is, at that moment in time,processing information or experiences at an unconscious level. You will\"see\" just what their \"program\" is. With this information, you will beable to communicate in a very powerful way. You can begin to commu-nicate to that person at both the conscious and unconscious level.Imagine that you are having a conversation with an individual. If thatperson's conscious output system is visual, and s/he is referencing to hervisual unconscious (input) system, then you need to \"talk visually,\" bothwith your words and eye movements. If you move your eyes up for asplit second before you speak and as you finish, you will have communi-cated to that person's unconscious system. You eye movements signalthat you \"understand\" how that person is generating their experience atthat moment in time. (In the last section on systems, I will give examplesof communication to be used where the individual output system andinput system are mixed: e.g., the output system is kinesthetic while theinput system is visual.)PATTERN VARIATIONSThere are several subtleties and variations that you will want tobecome aware of. For example, where an individual is planing his/hereyes back and forth on a more or less mid-line, s/he is experiencing aninternal (auditory) argument with him/herself. In many instances, theyare also generating very rapid, and often confusing, visual images. This\"program\" can occur in any individual from time to time, but is mostoften seen where the individual is under extreme stress. In fact, severelydysfunctioning individuals often evidence this pattern. It can be verypainful, and is usually a true GIGO program.Another variation is that of the \"straight ahead\" visualizer. This is a\"program\" where the individual appears to be looking at the listener, butis, instead, generating internal visual experiences. Often, such an indi-vidual is nearly oblivious to the people and events that are occurring inthe world around at that moment. There are two main clues for spottingthis program: Staring without blinking, and pupillary dilation. If youbelieve that an individual is engaged in this pattern, you can test to see ifyou are correct. You might hold your hand out and say, \"What color roseam I holding?\" If the individual looks puzzled or confused, s/he wasprobably not \"picturing\" straight ahead. On the other hand, if s/he con-tinues to stare, and gives you an answer—e.g., \"It's red\"—you haveguessed right. If you were to then reach out and \"hand\" him/her that rose,s/he might even take \"it.\" You could even suggest that s/he close her"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"10Monsters & Magical Stickseyes and continue to hold and look at the rose. If you do so, be preparedto be somewhat alone. S/he will probably enter into hypnosis. I could beincorrect. S/he may already be into the hypnotic state.There is one other important variation you need to consider for theauditory/visual pattern. Where an individual seems to be \"looking rightthrough you,\" s/he is really auditorializing and making a picture of whats/he is saying. In effect, s/he does not even see you, the listener. Instead,s/he has literally altered consciousness; is looking in the distance at animaginary blackboard; talking internally and picturing either the words,or the scenes that match the words. Most individuals find this pattern dis-concerting when directed at them. It is probably the single most misun-derstood of all patterns. When a man uses this pattern with a woman, shewill often feel as if he is \"undressing\" her. In reality, he hardly knowsshe is there. Where it is a woman using this pattern with a man, he willoften feel as if \"she acted as if I was nothing.\" Again, she is so into herown process, she's unaware of the world around her. I believe that thispattern always results in a form of \"self-hypnosis.\" If, while someone isusing this pattern, you make a sudden move (e.g., raise your arm high) ormake a sudden noise (e.g., snap your fingers), you will see them almostjump. They will look confused and startled. It will be almost as if theywere brought out of a \"trance\" too quickly. Often, that person will evi-dence amnesia for what had transpired just prior to their \"awakening.\"LEFT - RIGHT - LEFTNow, we can consider all of those people who are not right-handed,left-hemisphere dominant. Where the individual is left-handed, it is aneasy transition. Just reverse the meaning of eye movements. If a left-hander looks up to his right, he is generating past visual. If he looks up tohis left, he is constructing new pictures. Eyes down right equals auditory,while eyes down left indicates kinesthetic memories. The variationsmentioned above have the same general meaning regardless of left/right-hemispheric dominance.Sounds and looks simple, does it not? Well, it is and it is not. Thereis a category of individuals that I term \"cross-brain dominant.\" These areindividuals who may be right-handed, while they are right-brain domi-nant as if they were left-handed. On the other hand (pun intended), theymay be left-handed and left-brain dominant as if they were right-handed.When in doubt as to how a person is organized at the unconscious level,ask questions. For example, you might ask questions that require pastGIGOvisual recall: What color was your first car? What style was the firsthouse you lived in? Pay attention to where the individual puts his eyes. Ifhe looks up to the right for past information, forget what \"hand\" he is.His hemispheric dominance will tell you from where he is getting hisexperience. His handedness will only tell you with which hand he willsign his name, and for our purposes, that is not too terribly important.SYSTEM MYTHSI am now going to go out on a limb. I hope that you will refrain fromsawing it off while I am perched upon it. If you do saw it off, make surethere is a nice soft pillow for me to land on.There are some \"facts\" that most experts on systems agree upon. Ifind myself in total disagreement with a few of these \"facts.\" The firstfact is: where the individual's unconscious (input) system is differentfrom their conscious (output) system, that individual is incongruent. Ibelieve that an individual can have so-called \"mixed\" systems and still bevery congruent. In my opinion, it is the way they use their mixed systemin the real world that determines whether there is a problem or not.Where the individual functions well, and has the ability to make choices,then their mixed system is merely their unique program. It is only wheretheir mixed system produces pain and lack of choices that I would labeltheir mixed systems GIGO.The next fact I would like to dispute is that of the preferred input sys-tem. (Some systems people call this the \"lead\" system). The general viewis that individuals almost always have a specific preferred unconscioussystem. If their preferred unconscious system is visual, they will almostalways move their eyes up to the visual area; and similarly if their pre-ferred system is either auditory or kinesthetic. During my many years ofexperience, I have found that the preferred unconscious input systemoften changes. While I agree that there is a preferred unconscious system,I also believe that we change our preferred unconscious system depend-ing on the circumstances and our internal \"memories.\" In addition, anindividual may have one preferred unconscious system in, let us say, apleasant experience, while that system may be entirely different in apainful situation. In short, they may have two different programs depend-ing on the emotional content of their experiences.Example: An individual is telling you about a pleasant experience.Their output system is kinesthetic, while their input system (eye move-ments) is visual. They then begin to discuss an unpleasant and painful"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"Monsters & Magical Sticksexperience. Their output system stays the same, while their input changesto auditory. This type of switching can take place within all the systems(K—A—V) and in any combination. In the last section on systems, I willmake some recommendations as to how to deal with these \"switching\"systems, and what the switch itself might indicate.OUT OF CONSCIOUS SYSTEMMost system experts contend that the way an individual speaks(conscious output), eye movements (unconscious input), and so-called\"body language\" add up to all of the individual's communication sys-tems. I believe that there exists one more system: the Out of ConsciousUnconscious System (out of conscious system). This system, at first,sounds complicated. As you become comfortable with it, you will dis-cover that not only is it easy to understand, it may also be the key to asuccessful therapeutic outcome.If we were to refer back to the analogy of a computer, you will recallI made mention of a computer's operating system. Generally, this systemis \"unseen and unheard.\" The out of conscious system \"performs\" in thesame way. If an individual is using words such as, \"I see what youmean,\" \"That looks clear to me,\" \"I enjoy seeing a blue sky and seeingbeautiful scenery,\" that person is, at that moment, utilizing a visualoutput system. If, at the same time, they are using visual terms and arealso moving their eyes up left and right, you would know that, at thatmoment, their unconscious input system was also visual. If you were toask that person if s/he was aware that s/he was making pictures in theirmind, and they confirmed that fact, then you would know that theirunconscious system is one that they can bring into consciousness withoutdifficulty.There are many individuals, however, who will claim that they arenot making pictures, or who will claim that \"I can't visualize.\" In realty,that cannot be true. In their personal realty, it is true for them. What thatperson is really saying is: \"I am unable to become consciously aware ofthe images my mind is producing at this moment in time.\" In point offact, they are generating pictures, or that person would not know what achair is, or where they parked their car, but s/he is blocked as to con-scious awareness of the internal pictures. Therefore, their visual systemis, in this example, an Out of Conscious Unconscious System. In short,any system (K—A—V) that an individual is unable to bring into aware-ness, or that they are unaware of, is their out of conscious system. In theareas of dysfunction and pain, the out of conscious system may preventthe individual from having choices as to change.BLOCKED SYSTEMS: EXAMPLESIf you or I were to visually recall an unpleasant experience from ourpast, we would probably begin to experience some unpleasant feelings.You might pause now.. .and remember some past trauma; see it as clearlyas possible...and now become aware of feelings that match what you are\"seeing.\" Since you are aware of the connection between what you are\"seeing\" and what you are \"feeling,\" you have several choices that willchange your feelings. You could stop the pictures, or change them tosomething that is pleasurable, or remind yourself that it is in the past andyou survived it. But the individual who is seeing something painful,without the ability to \"know\" that they are \"seeing\" it, has a painfulproblem. That person will become aware of their painful feelings, butwill have no idea from whence they come. Without that awareness, s/hehas little or no control over what s/he will continue to experienceconsciously!The individual whose visual system is out of conscious, or whoclaims that they cannot get visual images, is someone who, during someperiod of their life, was forced to, or accidentally saw things that lookedvery scary and caused a great deal of pain. To protect themselves fromthat pain, they brought down a mental curtain over those (visual) memo-ries, and, in effect, produced amnesia for those events—at least in thevisual experience. Those pictures from the past are going on internally,but that person is afraid to see them. To avoid looking at these painfulimages, they block out \"seeing\" any pictures.Another example of the Out of Conscious Unconscious Systemwould be that of the person who, in processing information, looks downto their right (K), describes events visually, and informs you that theyhave trouble \"getting in touch with my feelings.\" Now, since s/he is awalking, talking, breathing human being, the feelings and emotions mustbe ongoing, but for some reason the channels for bringing those feelingsinto conscious awareness are blocked. This can be important informationfor you. The person who leads with their eyes to a kinesthetic system—that is, their unconscious system is kinesthetic—but tells you thingsPictorially, or announce that they have trouble feeling things, or that theycannot get in touch with feelings, is someone who, in all probability, wasforced to endure such physical and/or emotional pain that to protect"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"74Monsters & Magical Sticksthemselves, they literally disconnected from that part of their experience.As a result, they have difficulty using their kinesthetic system as aresource. You will find that such individuals tend to have many somaticcomplaints.OUT OF CONSCIOUS: RECAPBoth of the preceding examples may have been very efficaciouschoices at the time they were first used. For instance, if I break my legand I have the ability to disconnect from the pain while I go to a doctorto get my leg fixed, I have used that ability to make myself more com-fortable. However, if I continue to block the pain in my leg and walkaround on it without getting it set, I am going to end up with gangreneand the cure will become worse than the disease.People who appear in a therapist's office have, at some point in time,developed a cure worse than the disease. I do not want to burn my fin-gers, but I find that cutting my right arm off to protect my fingers is afoolish way of doing it. If I burn my fingers, they'll heal. Sewing myright arm back on may be a more difficult task. An individual who hasblocked his ability to utilize one or more systems has, in effect, cut offhis arm to protect his fingers. Ideally, a well-functioning human beingwill make use of all the systems, consciously and unconsciously. Inaddition, they will do it congruently. When their eye movements are upand they are making pictures, their description will be that of pictures; or,if their description is of feelings, they know they're making pictures andare aware of the connection between what they \"see\" and what they feel.When they are into their feelings, their body movements and their eyemovements will be to that part of their brain that indicates they are intotheir kinesthetic feelings. The same would hold true for auditory.Unfortunately, people who are not functioning well, who are in pain,tend to be making feelings out of pictures that they see in the back oftheir head, or they turn words into pictures into bad feelings. They dothese things without awareness and, therefore, without choice. They donot deal with the world around them, but rather their inner belief systemand inner reality has taken precedence over outer reality. They, in effect,use the same system to come up with the same painful memories to comeup with the same painful feelings in spite of the world and the optionsaround them. But, of course, there are those who still insist that there'sno such thing as hypnosis. Yet, there are people who can sit in a perfectlyquiet room with nothing going on and, in their mind, begin to hallucinateGIGOthings out of the past, respond with physiological responses, and emo-tionally feel fear, apprehension and depression. Even if you tell themthere is nothing going on around them, they continue to feel bad."},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"VIIISystems — So What?JIGSAW PUZZLESWhen I was a little boy, I was given a jigsaw puzzle as a gift. When Idumped all the pieces out, I was overwhelmed. There were so many littlepieces, and I did not know where to start. Someone helped me to figureout the secret. I learned to take one little piece and fit it together withanother little piece until several little pieces made a bigger piece. I thenlearned to take a few of the bigger pieces and fit them together into still abigger piece, until the whole puzzle was together. So, if you are feelingconfused/overwhelmed at this point, I understand. I hope to help you toassemble the little pieces into bigger pieces, until you have the puzzleassembled.What you are about to read is not the answer, but rather a generalguide. The ways in which you can utilize systems, and the methods fordoing so, are only limited by the limitations of your imagination. Onceyou are comfortable with the general principles, I want you to feel free tothrow away the rules. As you practice, you will find what works best foryou, and more importantly if you are a people-helper, what works bestfor your clients/patients.It is generally agreed by therapists of all stripes that the first step tosuccessful therapy is to establish rapport. Some schools of therapy holdthat it can take up to several sessions to establish that first step. With theuse of systems, I believe that rapport can, in the majority of cases, beestablished by learning to communicate in the individual's consciousoutput system (words), as well as in their unconscious system (eyemovements).SYSTEMS: GETTING STARTEDThe first step for you is to listen and pay attention to the way theindividual is expressing himself, and less to what he is saying. By payingattention to his choice of words, you will discover what his consciousoutput system is at that moment in time. The next step is for you to \"talkin his language.\" It is at this stage that many therapists (and people ingeneral) \"lose\" their audience. Here is an example of what NOT to do.PT: Things just look hopeless. I just cannot see a way out of myproblem. It is all so black and white and I feel trapped.DR: I know how you feel. I have been stuck myself. We can makean effort to get in touch with some solid new choices that canhelp you to feel hope.As you examine the above example, you may find yourself experi-encing some unsettling feelings. If so, imagine what the patient might beexperiencing. The patient's conscious output system was very clearlyvisual. As you look over his statements, I am sure you will see it. Thetherapist's response was very heavy into kinesthetic. As a result, thechances of establishing rapport is somewhere between slim and none. Anexample of what to do:PT: Things just look hopeless. I just cannot see a way out of myproblem. It is all so black and white and I feel trapped.DR: I know that when things look dark, we can end up feelingtrapped. Perhaps the two of us can find a different way of look-ing at this situation. When I have a more clear picture of thesituation, I might be able to help you to see things you haveoverlooked. Remember, a box of crayons has many other colorsin addition to black and white.As you re-examine the second example, I am sure you will easilysense the difference. While our mythical doctor did not say anythingconcrete, his statements seemed to be right on target. I would like you toset aside some time to try \"talking the other's language\" to see the resultsfor yourself. In short, listen to the conscious output system, and practiceputting your responses into the individual's system. I know that if youwill pay attention, you will discover how powerful a tool this is. Forthose of you who like excitement and adventure, practice purposefully"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"78Monsters & Magical Sticks79talking in a system that is not your patient's conscious output system. Ifyou watch carefully, you may see that many people will evidence pupil-lary dilation, altered breathing, a blank stare and a sense of not beingthere. We could say they may enter hypnosis. If you would like to playwith that, do this: First, communicate in your patient's output system forseveral interchanges. Then, abruptly switch to another system, step back,shut up and observe.PLUS (+) VERSUS MINUS (-) SYSTEM: CASEOnce you feel reasonably confident that you have identified theindividual's conscious output system in the area of his/her problem, thenext step is to find out if that system changes when s/he is talking aboutsomething that is pleasant. In many cases, there will be a definite switch.You can discover this by saying, for example, \"When things aren't sounpleasant for you, what do you like to do?\" When s/he answers, ask:\"What do you like most about...\" If there is a definite switch, you willhave some very valuable information. You will know what systems towhich to move the individual in order to help him/her feel better; whatsystem needs cleaning up; and to start communication in the \"painful\"system, while slowly moving to the one s/he knows how to feel good in.The following is an example from my practice:ME: What brings you here... That is, what would you like to have anew choice about?PT: I've been really down. I don't have any energy, and I just don'tcare about anything. [This was followed by several minutes of\"kinesthetic\" comments.]ME: I'm sorry you're feeling so badly. Problems can sometimes feelso heavy that we can feel good and stuck.PT: [Nods head vigorously] Yeah. You have it. I'm just so tired offeeling this way.ME: If I could wave a magic wand and take all those bad feelingsaway, what would you do that you enjoy?PT: Paint. I love to paint. [With this statement, there was a notice-able change in her demeanor, and she appeared to be a littlemore relaxed.]ME:PT:ME:PT:ME:PT:ME:What do you like most about painting?I like to see the painting take shape. I really enjoy putting thedifferent colors on the canvas, and when I finish, I feel reallygood just looking at what I have created. [At this point, there isa definite shift to a visual output, and she is actually smiling.]What else have you seen yourself doing that you are proud of?[Pause] Oh, I know! I once designed a dress from scratch! Thatmay not sound like much to you, but to me it was a big deal. Ilooked all over for a pattern that looked like what I wanted, butI couldn't find one. They either looked awful, or they wouldn'tfit me. So I actually designed my own dress pattern and adjustedit to fit just me. It came out just beautiful and it looked great onme. [At this point, she is sitting up straight, with good eye con-tact; her voice is strong, and she looks anything but depressed.]That's great. You saw that someone else's idea of a pattern didnot fit you, and you did something about it. I can see how proudof that you must be. Now I would like you to do us both a favor.I want you to close your eyes, and see yourself designing thatpattern, and cutting it out. Then I want to see yourself goingthrough all of those steps that led you to creating a pattern anddress that looked right for you. As soon as you have that pictureclear in your mind, I would like you to signal YES by raising thefirst finger of your left hand. [As I said this, I reached over andlightly stroked that finger. With the emphasis on the word yes,and the stroking of her finger, I was setting up an ideomotorresponse.]OK. [Closes her eyes and continues to appear very relaxed.After a time, her finger moves up.]Thank you. Now I want you to watch that you who is so deeplyinvolved in what she is creating...A NEW PATTERN. [Thiswas the beginning of helping her to disassociate and to focusher on the enjoyment of creating new patterns.] I want you topay attention to how much she is concentrating on the newpattern...the feeling of pleasure...the feeling of the scissors inher hand. ..the determination to design a beautiful new pattern"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"Systems — So What?81CASE: SECOND SESSIONPT:ME:PT:ME:PT:ME:PT:ME:PT:ME:I really had an interesting week. For three days after I saw you,I was really floating. Things looked brighter, not only in mylife, but even colors. I was much more aware of what was goingon around me. On the fourth day, I crashed. I felt just asdepressed as before.You don't look depressed now... In fact, you look very good.I feel great. As I was sitting around being depressed, I suddenlyheard your voice. I heard you asking me how I would like to tryto paint blindfolded, by feelings only. I suddenly realized that Iwas busy running my life by feelings without looking at otherways. Then I saw myself cutting cut a dress pattern that didn'tfit me, and, if I wanted it to change, I had better make a newpattern. I began to look at what I was doing to make myself sounhappy, and after a while I saw it [She went on to explain howshe would focus on everything that could go wrong; thinking\"crazy\" thoughts, etc.; and how she was making herself look atthe whole picture, etc.] Now I would like to ask you a question.Ask away.You hypnotized me, didn't you?Well, it looked to me as if you decided to go into that state.Well, it was wonderful, only I didn't believe I could be hypno-tized.It's nice to see that you are able to learn new ideas.I didn't tell you before, but I had gone to a doctor who usedhypnosis, and it was a disaster. He kept telling me to feel heavy,and to sink down in the chair. The more he told me to feelheavy, the more upset I became. I thought he was telling me tobe more down than I was already. So I really fought him, andnever went back.Maybe he didn't know how to show you what you needed tosee. [At this point, I gave her a brief lecture on the principles ofMonsters & Magical SticksPT:ME:that fits her, and helps her to really look good. [I continued todiscuss her experience in great detail for close to 20 minutes. Iemphasized losing track of time and place; of not paying atten-tion to sore muscles or feelings; of solving the problem of thewrong pattern; of accepting that the patterns designed by othersmay not be right for her, and that she could choose to discardthem and create her own.][Opens her eyes; looks around and sighs] That was quite anexperience. At first the picture was very vague, but then itbecame very vivid. I felt like I was floating and observing my-self. After a while I could hear your voice, but it was far away,and I don't know if I paid attention. I feel very good. I knowI'm looking at things in a different way, but for the life of me, Icould not tell you what happened.That sounds like you had a nice learning experience, and en-joyed yourself in the process. Now our time is almost up [Pt.looks surprised, and glances quickly at her watch], but I wouldlike to ask you something else. How would you like to attemptto paint a beautiful picture, or create a new pattern while youwere blindfolded so that you had to do that by feelings only?[Laughs] I wouldn't. It would probably be impossible. Even if Icould do it, I'm sure it would be frustrating, and I don't think Iwould enjoy it. I probably wouldn't like to look at the finishedproduct.That's Right! I was sure you knew that, and that you only forgotfor a while. Now that you see that clearly, 1 know you will getthe picture and continue to feel better![Looks puzzled] What? I don't know if I understand[smiles...head nods slowly yes].Good! She sees what I mean, and can show you a pleasant sur-prise. I will see you next week.PT:ME:PT:ME:"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"82Monsters & Magical SticksSystems - So What?the systems, and pointed out how well she responded to visualcommunication.]PT: That makes sense. When I first closed my eyes, I started to gettense. Then you talked about seeing myself making the pattern,and I started to get the picture in my mind. It seemed very natu-ral. The next thing I knew I was floating.CASE REVIEWLet us review the above case together. When she first explained her\"problem,\" she was in her kinesthetic system. I began by talking to her inthat system. I next asked her to recall something pleasant, and sheswitched into a visual output system. With that information, I was readyto help her have some new choices. I knew that I needed to help her backinto her visual system, to help her have recall of more pleasant kines-thetic experiences, and to use her skills (painting and designing the dresspattern) to create a metaphor that would help her to approach her situa-tion in a new way (pattern) and to understand just how she was creatingher bad feelings. As you re-read this case, I am sure it will become veryclear. Last, but not least, her comments regarding her previous experi-ence with hypnosis should give you cause to...pause now...and recog-nize the importance of using the individual's system of communication.FINE POINTSThere are a few more points about the conscious output system that Iwould like to have you get a handle on so that it will be very clear. Avisual individual needs some time and space to \"make\" their pictures. Ifyou move too close too quickly, the visual individual will usuallyrespond with anxiety. Once a visual person has evidenced that they arecomfortable with you, it is then OK to move in (slowly) and make somephysical contact. On the other hand, a kinesthetic individual will feel thatyou are cold and unfeeling if you sit (or stand) too far away and don'tmake some physical contact. These two points are important. If you wantto \"blow\" rapport in a matter of a few seconds, move in very close andtouch a visual, and stand way back from a kinesthetic.Next, where an individual is in physical pain, they are in a painfulkinesthetic system. Helping them to move from kinesthetic into eithervisual and/or auditory will produce some profound and interestingchanges. In addition, moving an individual slowly from his consciousoutput system to another system, and then continuing to loop through allthree will, in most cases, result in the individual \"taking a trip\" to that\"other state.\"THE NEXT STEPOnce you have ascertained the individual's conscious output systemin both the problem area and in a more pleasant area, you are ready forthe next major step. It is now time to learn what the unconscious systemis. Again, you will want to find out if there is a shift in the unconscioussystem where the individual switches from the problem to a more pleas-ant experience. When you have spotted the unconscious system, you areready for some powerful work. You have what you need to begin com-municating on two levels at once, and to produce so-called \"informal\"hypnosis without an induction or \"formal\" trance.A man enters your office, sits down and begins to discuss his prob-lem. You have discovered that his conscious output system is kinesthetic,and you are responding in kind. You next discover that his unconscioussystem is visual (his eyes almost always move up left and then back toyou before he speaks). One choice you have is: when he finishes a state-ment, you look up briefly to your right (his left as he looks at you), thenat him, and then \"talk kinesthetically.\" When you finish your statement,again look up briefly to your right. In effect, you are telling him that youunderstand just how he is creating his experiences, and where he keeps\"finding\" a source for his problem. Instead of this method, or added to it,you might choose to be a mind reader. As you talk in his system(kinesthetic), you can slowly change to his unconscious system, and tellhim what he is doing.Example: \"I know that you are feeling bad right now, and you'retired of those feelings, and when you become aware of those picturesfrom your past [move your eyes up right—his left—as he looks] andlearn to stop seeing all that or to change those pictures, you will be sur-prised at how quickly you can feel better.\" With this method, many inter-esting things can, and often do, happen. I have had people suddenlyrecall past events and their attendant pain. In one instance, a man justfroze, stopped breathing for several seconds, and then began to cry. Hehad claimed to have no feelings and to be a cold person. Most often, theindividual will just stop and stare, and, in many cases, nod his or herhead, or in some other way affirm what you have just said. Often, the"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"84Monsters & Magical Sticks Systems — So What?individual will simply go into hypnosis... I forgot...there's no suchthing. But, if there was, when the individual stops and stares, you maynotice pupillary dilation, a marked change in breathing and other interest-ing \"things.\" Sometimes, I simply say, \"That's right. Now you can closeyour eyes and drift...and those pictures will soon be that much moreclear.\"MAKING UNCONSCIOUS CONSCIOUSAnother powerful approach is to simply help an individual becomeaware of the relationship between their unconscious system and whatthey are experiencing. Once they understand, it is relatively easy to helpthem learn to stop the process, and to change it.Example: A 12-year-old boy, \"P\", with behavioral problems atschool. In addition, his parents had informed me that the boy was with-drawn and nearly totally non-communicative.ME: Well, \"P\" what do you think your parents brought you to see mefor?\"P\": [eyes down left] I don't know. I just get into trouble a lot.ME: Sounds to me as if you don't feel too good inside.\"P\": [eyes down left] Yeah, I feel bad.ME: Before you started to feel bad, what did you like to do for fun?\"P\": [eyes straight ahead, then up left, then straight ahead] Baseball Iguess. That's fun, and it makes me feel good.ME: What part of baseball do you feel the best about?\"P\": [eyes up left for split second, then looks at me] I like it all, buthitting is fun. I feel good when I get a hit.ME: I'm glad you know how to feel good [at this point I reachedover and touched his arm lightly], but I think it's sad that youhave been feeling so bad inside.\"P\": [eyes down left] Yeah.ME: You must get real tired of those bad feelings, and I wonder justwhat that voice is telling you that makes you feel that way?\"P\": [head jerks up straight] What do you mean?ME: I would like to help you to feel better, but I need you to helpme. You don't have to tell me any secrets or anything you don'twant to.

[again touched hisarm] Now, I would like you to practice that all by yourself, andI'll just watch.After several practices, \"P\" was having a problem keeping his eyesdown to the left. Every time he began to look down to his left, his headand then his eyes would \"pop\" back up. He was also smiling, alert andvery talkative. At this point, I knew the following: \"P's\" conscious out-put system in both his painful area and his \"success\" area was kines-thetic. However, there was a definite switch in his unconscious systemfrom auditory (painful) to visual (successful). I also knew that he hadsome old painful tapes running in his head that were the source of hispainful loop. I also knew that the next step was to help him to bring intoconsciousness the voice or voices he was hearing, and what was beingsaid. That was my next task."},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"86Monsters & Magical Sticks Systems — So What?ME: \"P,\" I would like you to close your eyes, and listen to the soundof those voices you have been hearing.

Keep on watching until that younger you lookshappy and then see him growing up strong and happy.I saw \"P\" two additional times. After the first session, his parentsreported that the change was like magic. He was talkative, helpingaround the house, and getting along in school. And he had told his par-ents that he didn't like it when they yelled at each other, and that whenthey did he was going to go somewhere and not worry. Two years later Isaw his mother for another matter, and she reported that his \"problems\"never came back. (By the way, I have \"blown\" them just as dramaticallyas I have been successful.)SYSTEM INTERRUPTIONSAnother very powerful method of restructuring an individual'sunconscious pattern is to interpret the painful pattern, and direct the indi-vidual to their successful one. For example, the individual looks up leftfor a split second, and then looks straight ahead when s/he is discussingsome positive experience. When s/he begins to talk about the area ofdifficulty, the eyes go up left, then down left (auditory) then down rightwhile s/he discusses a painful situation. The next time s/he begins to talkabout the problem, you snap your fingers at the moment s/he starts tomove his/her eyes down left. In addition, you ask them, or signal them,to look at you while they talk. The result will be: that you have directedthem into using the unconscious successful pattern—in this case, eyes upleft, then straight ahead.A variation of this method would be to help the individual overlaythe successful unconscious pattern onto the problem area. For example, a10-year-old boy who had developed an almost phobic response to hisfather's (angry) voice. In his areas of success, he was visual both in hisconscious and unconscious system. He was asked to \"listen\" to the soundof his father's voice in his mind. Then I helped him to change the pictureof his father into increasingly humorous ones. The last picture was of bisfather standing and yelling while in a pair of old underwear that was fullof holes. In less than 20 minutes, his \"phobic\" response was broken up.He was told to keep his new picture a secret, which he did. It has beenover a year, and he has never had a reoccurrence of his problem. (I alsohad a brief session with the father and helped him to realize the effect bisyelling was producing. His wife later reported that he had substantiallyreduced his yelling, but that when he did, her son seemed unaffected.)MASTERING OUT OF CONSCIOUSThe next area for you to begin mastering is that of the out of con-scious unconscious system (out of conscious system). That is of particu-lar importance in the area of the individual's dysfunction. For example, apatient's conscious output system is kinesthetic, while the input system isvisual, and you do not observe any evidence of his/her using the auditorysystem to check out \"reality.\" The indication here is that the auditory isthe out of conscious system. Another example, using the same systems asabove: you ask the individual what s/he is seeing in his/her mind and thereply is, \"I'm not seeing any pictures\"—or words to that effect—equalsout of conscious visual. Another pattern might be: Patient looks up left,then down left and the conscious output system is very visual. This couldindicate that the kinesthetic is the out of conscious system; or, if youwere to ask what s/he is saying to him/herself and the response is, \"I'mnot saying anything\" or \"I don't hear anything\" equals out of consciousauditory."},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"Monsters & Magical SticksSystems — So What?OUT OF CONSCIOUS TO CONSCIOUSOnce you have determined which is the out of conscious system, youhave two primary choices: to bring that system into conscious awarenessso that the individual stops giving him/herself hypnotic suggestions forwhich there is then \"amnesia,\" or to use that system as the one in whichyou structure your hypnotic and therapeutic work. Since that system isout of conscious, almost any hypnotic work you do in that system will, inmost cases, lead to amnesia for that work. When that happens, it makes itvery difficult for your patient to \"block\" or \"sabotage\" the therapeuticprocess.If you choose the first method—bringing the system into aware-ness—you have several choices. The easiest, and in most cases thefastest, is to do system overlays. That simply means starting in the indi-vidual's conscious system, moving to the unconscious system and then tothe out of conscious system, and repeating the procedure until you get thedesired results.Let us say that the patient's auditory is the out of conscious system,while visual is the conscious output, and, to make it easy, kinesthetic isthe unconscious system. (By the way, what I have just described is anunusual combination. I picked it to make my job of clarification easierfor me.) Let us also say that your patient has informed you that s/hereally likes to go to the beach. You might then ask him/her to closehis/her eyes and picture the beach on a beautiful day. As your patientresponds, you would then spend a few minutes describing visual experi-ences common to the beach. As you observe signs of relaxation, or calm-ness, or concentration, or even trance, you would then begin to introducekinesthetic experiences: e.g., watching the beautiful blue sky and theclouds, and feeling the warmth from that bright sun. After a few minutesof visual/kinesthetic, you would begin to introduce the auditory experi-ence: \"And the sound of the waves crashing in helps you to relax evenmore, and as you hear the sounds of the waves, you watch the wavesbuilding and then falling, you feel a deep calmness. You can see childrenplaying and hear the sound of their laughter, and remember a feeling ofpleasure from your past,\" etc., etc.With system overlaying, one of two things will happen; in manycases, both will happen. Your patient will move into that state of mindthat we might call hypnosis, and, perhaps more slowly and with more\"experiences\" of system overlay, the out of conscious system's \"block\"will crumble. I have had dozens of individuals report that, as they experi-enced what I was describing, they began to hear the sounds clearly, orfeel all the feelings, or get clear pictures. What is even more important isthat in subsequent sessions they report and give evidence of \"cleaningup\" that block in their real world. Try it.. .you'll like it.UNBLOCKING VIA COMMON EXPERIENCEAnother approach to the unblocking of an out of conscious system isto begin simply talking about common, pleasant experiences in thatsystem: e.g., out of conscious kinesthetic = talk about what it feels like totake a warm shower after a hard day's work; the feelings of a freshlylaundered sheet when you get into bed; the warm afterglow of makinglove. Use your imagination, almost anything will do it. If, as you aredescribing common feelings, you begin to more and more describe pleas-ant feelings of childhood, you will stand a good chance of producinghypnosis and a regression to their childhood. This will happen becauseyour communication will cause them to have to go into their out ofconscious system in order to find that experience. Once the individualgoes into that system, they must leave their conscious output systemsomewhere else. In short, an altered state of consciousness.UTILIZING OUT OF CONSCIOUS SYSTEMIf you make the choice of leaving the out of conscious system justthat—out of conscious—your approach would be very different fromwhat you have read thus far. You could use that system to \"mind read\"and provoke internal searches. Let us assume that the individual has anout of conscious auditory system. You could say something like: \"Andsoon you will remember just who that person was that said those thingsthat are still causing you to feel that way,\" or: \"And I know that as youbecome aware of what that voice is saying, you will know how to solvethat problem.\" Such an approach will \"stir up\" a lot of internal activity,and generally will cause the individual to soon discover what that audi-tory system is doing.Another use of the out of conscious system is to use it to produceamnesia for beneficial suggestions. Example: A patient whose consciousoutput system was visual, while her out of conscious system was kines-thetic. She told me that \"everything looks hopeless. When I see the wayPeople look at me I really get upset.\" I asked her to tell me what thesound of hopelessness was. Her face went blank; she looked confused,and, after a moment, her eyes went down left, then up left. At that point,"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"goMonsters & Magical SticksI said, \"OK, instead you can begin to feel stronger and feel more calm.\"She looked at me and said, \"What? 1 didn't hear what you said.\" Sincemy \"suggestion\" was made in her out of conscious system, while she wasusing her other systems to search, she had amnesia for my words. As thissession progressed, she became very relaxed. As we finished she said,\"I'm not sure what happened today, but I feel much more calm, and Ithink I may be strong enough to beat this.\"THE SHOCK METHODThere is one more approach to the out of conscious system I wouldlike to give you: The shock method. With this approach, you simplyignore the conscious and unconscious system, and go straight to the outof conscious system. Example: Conscious output system equals kines-thetic; unconscious input system equals auditory; out of conscious sys-tem equals visual. The patient is talking \"kinesthetically\" about how bads/he feels. You respond, \"When you see what those feelings look like, Iknow you will be able to change the picture to one that looks muchbetter.\" With this method, you have a good chance of producing amnesiafor what you have said, causing an informal hypnotic state for a moment(or much longer) and/or producing an unconscious restructure withoutthe patient being aware of how all of this took place.CASE 5: \"R\"I would now like to tell you about \"R\" and how the use of systemsmade the difference between success and a great big zero. \"R\" wasbrought to my office by his wife, and as I soon learned, he had not reallyagreed to see me. He refused to fill out my intake form, and when hecame into my office he would not talk. He sat with his arms tightlycrossed and gave every evidence of being very hostile. His wife informedme that \"R\" had not been his usual self for nearly a year; that she hadtaken him to a psychiatrist and he had refused to cooperate; and that hewould not tell her what was bothering him. I asked him what he thoughtthe trouble was, and his response was to merely shrug his shoulders. Theonly other information I had was that \"R\" stared to his left, with his eyesin a slightly upward mode. Since he wouldn't talk, I began to usemetaphors with my emphasis on visual experiences. I talked about a littleboy being afraid and angry. Each story was filled with visual informa-tion After about 10 minutes, \"R\" began glancing at me, and wouldoccasionally nod his head. As he appeared to be starting to respond (verySystems — So What?slightly at this point), I began to tie in kinesthetic experiences to mystories; e.g., \"...and the little boy couldn't see any way out of his prob-lem, which caused him to feel a very heavy feeling inside.\" \"R\" nowbegan to stare freely at me and his body posture relaxed slightly. How-ever, even though he was now looking in my direction, it was clear to methat he was now in an altered state. His eyes had a far-away distractedlook, and his facial muscles had flattened out. Several minutes later helooked right at me, blinked several times, and interrupted me to say, \"Iget the picture. If I don't look for a way out of this, I'll never see thingsdifferently.\" He then began to talk quite freely. He said that he had beenvery depressed about his children leaving home, and by the \"fact\" that hewas getting on in years (he was 62) without ever having seen himselfsuccessful. He also admitted that not only hadn't he wanted to see me,but that he had come in prepared to be very hostile. (I discovered laterthat he believed that seeking help was a sign of his failure, and he didn'twant to \"face\" that.)CASE 6: CHANGEAt this juncture, \"R\" was actually very friendly and talkative. His\"problem\" just poured out, almost always beginning with his visual sys-tem and ending in his kinesthetic. Since he was using a ton of words, Imade the following assumptions as to his systems: His output systemwas primarily auditory, with visual being a strong second. His uncon-scious system was visual (very pronounced) and since he never movedhis eyes to the kinesthetic or auditory, my best guess was that both hiskinesthetic and auditory were out of conscious. He verified my assump-tions when he told me, \"I have a lot of trouble feeling close to people orshowing any emotions, and my wife tells me that I don't listen to peoplevery well.\"I spent several minutes discussing the processes of unconsciouslearning, emphasizing visual experiences. I then said, \"I would like youto see for yourself how the unconscious can work separately from theconscious. I want you to hold your hand in front of your face like this.\"At this point I \"show\" him with my hand, palm toward my face.\"Good. Now, as you watch your hand just like that, your unconsciouswill show you something you need to see... Perhaps that little boy at atime and place where he began to see himself as not good enough.[Pause] That's right...and as that picture becomes more clear, that handwill begin to bring that picture closer toward your face, while the sound"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"Monsters & Magical Sticks93of my voice makes you feel stronger.\" His hand begins slowly movingtoward his face.\"Now, as you get the picture [using the exact phrase he had used ear-lier], you may find the comfort of closing your eyes [blinks several timesand then his eyes close], and I really don't know just where you will seethat hand coming to rest against your face, as my voice relaxes you moreand more. I know it will be strange to see that picture of the little boywho feels bad while you feel comfortable even more.. .now.\"His hand reaches his face after several minutes, and he appears to bevery deep into \"that state.\" \"Now, as you continue to learn somethingimportant to you, you can continue to change the feelings into those ofcomfort, and I don't want that hand to move down any more quicklythan...YOU HAVE LEARNED SOMETHING IMPORTANT, and that isno more quickly than you hear the voice inside telling the little boy that itwill be OK, and that it never was what he thought it was.\"It was close to ten minutes before \"R's\" hand began moving down,and when it was on his lap, he opened his eyes. He began to cry softly(pretty good for a man who has trouble feeling or showing his feelings),and told me about two incidents that had really \"got to him\" as a child.His eyes were now moving to the kinesthetic area when he was recallingthe feelings of those incidents, and several times they went briefly to hisauditory. He informed me that sometimes he heard my voice, but most ofthe time he didn't, and that he could remember very little about what Ihad said.The example of \"R\" is but a small example of what systems can dofor you, and, more importantly, for your patients/clients. I know that this\"trip\" through the land of systems has led you to \"see\" many new sights,as well as touch upon many interesting points, and I hope that the soundswere stimulating also. Even though this trip is ending, you have onlystarted. As you practice, you will discover that I have only touchedlightly on all the possibilities that you will soon see.It is far beyond the scope of this work to get into all of the ramifica-tions, subtleties and surprises. One of the surprises I hope that you willsoon discover is this: All systems, from anxiety to depression, anorexiato obesity, will have certain set patterns or systems. I will go more out ona limb and state that the majority of people with each symptom will havethe same patterns. Once you recognize the pattern and its loop, you needto help the individual break it, and form a choice of patterns.Now that you have shed some, and maybe all, of the excess baggageyou began with, your hands are free to get a firm grasp on new things,and I hope you will find the rest of this book a journey forward withcomfort...NOW."},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"patterns95IXPatternsHYPNOSIS AND PATTERNSPicture, if you will, an old time hypnotist putting a subject into ahypnotic state and then giving a powerful suggestion. (For those of youwho are wondering just what a powerful suggestion is: Those that workare powerful; the rest are weak.) The hypnotist suggests that at 4:00 inthe afternoon, the subject's nose will itch and the subject will have toscratch it. If this suggestion were effective, the subject would respond asexpected. If he were to repeat this response three or four days in a row,he might be surprised to discover that he had developed a pattern ofscratching his nose at 4:00 P.M. each day. Even an individual withouttraining in hypnosis would recognize that the pattern was the result of thehypnotic suggestion. Of course!Take a child and tell him, over and over, that he will never be asgood as his father, nor as his brother, and that he will never amount toanything. Years later, every time he is about to get a promotion, he getsdrunk and \"forgets\" to show up for work, and he amounts to nothing. Wewouldn't call that a pattern resulting from hypnosis.. .or would we?Patterns are a necessary and important part of our behavior. Mostpatterns serve as useful functions, and free our mind for new learningexperiences. In reading this you are relying on patterns learned manyyears ago: patterns in sitting, holding the book, seeing the words, under-standing, and learning.You drive down a street and a car runs a red light right in front ofyou. Automatically, you jam on the brakes, tighten up and prepare for thepossibility of a crash. During those actions, there were literally hundredsof physiological, psychological and emotional responses occurring in apatterned way, designed to help you. If you had to \"think\" out and ana-lyze the situations and your responses, you no doubt would have had anaccident.PATTERNS. AN EXPERIMENTWe humans not only rely on patterns, but, as I will point out shortly,we are capable of adopting patterns in a very rapid fashion. In addition,we are uncomfortable—sometimes even miserable—when our patternsare interfered with or changed. Think back...now...to a time when youmoved, changed jobs or even rearranged your furniture. You may be ableto remember those vague uneasy feelings. You may even experiencesome of that now or in a short while.Try the following experiment: Pay attention to your sequence(pattern) of dressing in the morning. Do you put your pants on beforeyour shirt? Right shoe before the left? Blouse before your skirt? Shavethe right side of your face before the left? Cheeks before the neck? Onceyou have discovered your patterns, make every effort to vary your pat-terns each day for several days. You may notice that you feel awkwardand a little clumsy. Next, change the side of the bed you normally sleepon. Be prepared! You may have some difficulty falling asleep. On theother hand, you may not sleep well at all. If you sleep with someone, andI hope you do, and if they agree to change sides with you, share yourexperience the next morning. Last, but not least, if you eat a meal in afamily setting, have everyone take a different seat from the patternedones you usually take. Pay close attention to your internal responses, andobserve the behavior of those around you.It has been estimated that at least 60% to 70% of all our behaviorsare patterned responses. Patterns can free us for more creative endeavors.Maladaptive and self-defeating behaviors are patterned responses also. Inmy opinion, therapy succeeds, by whatever method or construction,Whenever painful patterns are interrupted and more successful patternsare utilized in their place.There are biological patterns built into the system, but the ones wewish to explore are learned. What can be learned can be relearned. We allknow how to crawl and we always will. However, we have also learnedhow to walk, and find that to be, in most cases, a better choice. We knowwhen crawling would be our most effective choice and can decide whento rely on that pattern. People who rely on maladaptive patterns oftenappear to have no choice as to when or where to use another pattern. Amaladaptive behavior may be totally inappropriate under the circum-94"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"Monsters & Magical SticksPatterns97stances, or it may have served a purpose in the past and now be archaic.Or, the painful results may be due to a lack of choices as to when to relyon the pattern.PAIN AS A PATTERNPhysiological pain is more than pain. It, too, is a pattern. The indi-vidual suffering pain from illness or injury responds to that pain in apatterned way. The pattern is based on their past experience with pain,their belief system as to their ability to deal with pain, as well as theirfuture expectations. The individual whose past experience and beliefsystem lead them to expect that they can handle it—that they've alwaysdone OK, and they \"know\" that they will recover quickly—becomeswhat is called a \"reducer.\" As the name implies, these individuals areable not only to minimize their response to pain, they are also able toactually lower their perception of the pain itself. At the other end of thescale is what is called an \"augmenter.\" An augmenter's belief system,and therefore their remembered history of pain, is that pain is terrible,awful, always gets worse, and they can't stand it. Their future expecta-tion is that the pain will always get worse before it gets better.This patterned response of thinking leads to the patient who inter-prets twinges, the itching of healing, pressure, gas after surgery, etc., assignals of pain, and, as if by black magic or negative hypnosis, they actu-ally experience more pain. Augmenters recover from illness or surgerymore slowly, with more complications, and more complaints than a re-ducer. To reason with an augmenter, or argue, or give up and walk awayin disgust, is to forget that their belief system and pattern of response is,in effect, operating as a hypnotic suggestion. Logic and reason have littleor less to do with it. So keep on forgetting.. .forgetting to use logic.Just as a pattern can be an effective and automatic response produc-ing beneficial results, so too can a pattern be an effective and automaticmethod for self-defeat. If an individual combines a belief system such as,\"I can't succeed, I always fail,\" with a pattern of behavior that leads toself-defeat, he not only fails, but the failure itself \"proves\" his beliefsystem. This leads to reinforcement of the automatic patterns of beliefand behavior. It is well-known in scientific and academic communitiesthat an individual can state a hypothesis, and then find the data andstatistics to prove the theory. This principle also holds true for beliefsystems and patterns. A belief system leads to automating a response thatleads to proving the belief system that leads to repetition of the pattern- Itis almost like the proverbial snake eating its own tail and complainingabout its imminent demise.G.A. Miller, E. Galanter and K.H. Pribram (Plans and the Structureof Behavior, 1960) point out that habits and skills are plan that begin asvoluntary processes, but in the process of repeating and overlearningbecome fixed and automatic.HYPNOSIS — PATTERNS — ERICKSONIn the section on therapeutic applications, we will discuss, in moredetail, methods for interrupting self-defeating patterns of behavior, anawe will help you to develop patterns for understanding and discoveringpatterns. For now, consider the results of sudden pattern interruption.Several years ago, researchers decided to interrupt hypnotic subjectsas they were performing post-hypnotic tasks. They found somethingquite interesting. The subject, upon being interrupted, spontaneouslyentered into a hypnotic state. Milton Erickson utilized this phenomenonas a method of trance induction. For example, he would give a sugges -tion for some post-hypnotic activity to take place at the next session Dr.Erickson would then interrupt the pattern. The subject not only enteredinto the hypnotic state, in many cases the subject developed spontaneousamnesia for the events just preceding the trance state. If you, as a therapist, can discover a pattern in your patient, and lead the patient to recreateit, and interrupt it before completion, you may be surprised- You mightfind the individual entering into the hypnotic state. I may be wrong, Youmay not be surprised at all.CASE 7: PATTERN INTERRUPTIONA woman entered my office, sat down, tightly crossed her legs, thencrossed her arms over her chest, let out a deep sigh and began spewingout words. The words were about her hopeless situation, her stupidityher inability to do anything right, and that she probably couldn't evenlearn \"this hypnotic stuff.\" At that point, my phone rang, Since wasexpecting an important call, I had not turned it off. The woman lookedupset, so I apologized and had her wait in the reception room while Icompleted the call. When I asked her back in, she sat in the same chair,and recreated her initial behavior in every detail: tightly crossed her legs,then her arms, deep sigh, and then the stream of words of helplessness.Recognizing her behavior as a probable pattern, I decided to interruptI said sharply, \"Wait, I can't hear you from there. Would you mind"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"Monsters & Magical SticksPatterns99moving to that other chair so I can hear you better?\" She moved to theother chair, crossed her legs, then arms, then sighed, but before she couldspew, I turned to my desk and began writing without a glance at her.Next, I apologized and told her that the first chair would be better andshe could help me by moving back. As she sat down, I told her to pleasecross her legs and only then her arms. As she complied, she developedwhat Dr. Erickson calls \"responsive attentiveness\" (Erickson, Rossi1976). The best description of this might be \"staring in an almost day-dreaming way.\"She was then told to close her eyes and take a deep breath and let itout slowly (i.e., her sigh described differently) before we could talk. Asshe complied (already responding to my lead and suggestions), she wasthen told, \"Now that you are becoming so much more relaxed, you cancontinue breathing slowly, relaxing that much more [leaving it to her tofigure out how much is that much more], and soon you may want touncross just your arms or just your legs first [implying there would be asecond uncrossing without knowing when].\" Within two minutes, a mostsatisfactory state had been achieved.As you analyze the preceding example, you may grasp now theimportance of the recognition and interruption and potential of patterns.It was a better than even bet that the woman's behavior was a patternedresponse in approaching any problem. Since she was in my office askingfor help, it was also a good bet that her pattern was not working. Herpattern was first interrupted before she could get into her words ofdespair (sent her to another chair). She was then interrupted again, thistime before her sigh (sent her back to the first chair). Her pattern wasagain interrupted and directed (cross your legs and only then your arms)and further interrupted by the injection of \"close your eyes and take adeep breath and let it out slowly before we can talk.\" In summary, herpattern was interrupted, then redirected and then redirected again into aformal hypnotic state.INSTANT PATTERNPatterns, whether graceful and efficacious or painful and destructive,can be established rather rapidly. In his work on split brain, Gazzaneza(1967) discussed what he termed \"conditional reflex, or bad habit\" andthe rapidity with which an individual can learn such patterns of behaviorwhen he said:We must remember that we are examining a half of the humanbrain, a system easily capable of learning from a single trial in a test.— The Split Brain in Man by Michael S. Gazzanega,August 1967, p. 372 \"Progress in Psychobiology\"Readings from Scientific American, W.F. Freeman & Co.At our training seminars, I will have a volunteer hold out either theirright or left arm straight ahead, making a fist with their arm very, verystiff. I then tell them I am going to give them an instruction that isimpossible to carry out: I'm going to ask them to raise their arm up andmove it down at the same time. Of course, it's impossible to go in twodirections at the same time. I then state, \"Begin.\" While they stare at mein disbelief, I say, \"That's right, now you can BLINK.\" I emphasize\"blink\" with my voice. At that moment in time, the person will blink.You could imagine that the brain is saying, \"What is this craziness? Ican't raise my arm up and move it down at the same time.\" But whenthey hear, \"You can blink,\" the brain says, \"Of course, I can do that.\"Now, the interesting thing is how quickly that suggestion is accepted.What is even more interesting is, if you ask that person within a minuteor two after their first trial to raise that arm and hold it up again, in mostcases, s/he will automatically blink as s/he brings the arm up. In effect,the beginning of a pattern has been established in seconds. If s/he were torepeat this raising of the arm and blinking for four, five or ten times in aday, s/he might develop what is called a conditioned reflex, or a badhabit.If, as I believe, a conditioned response can be produced that quickly,imagine what happens when a person is raised hearing certain statementsabout limitations, or having certain kinds of painful incidents happeningover and over. If, in a matter of seconds, we can learn to put out our rightarm and blink at the same time, what would happen to a child or an adulthearing something said over and over when it's connected with ademonstration of how they are supposed to behave.For example, consider the woman who sees her mother drunk all thetime and whose father says, \"You're just like your mother, don't be thatway.\" The child grows up and behaves just like her mother whileprotesting that she doesn't want to be that way, carrying out both ends ofthe suggestion.The combination of internal belief systems (brought about by trau-mas, suggestions, or what have you), and the repetition of patterns ofbehavior that reinforce belief systems, simply results in an individual"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"100Monsters & Magical Stickswho is stuck and without choice. You must look not at what the world isdoing to them, but rather what they are doing within the world based onwhat belief system and what patterns. Since a form of hypnosis has beenused to convince them that things exist which do not exist, or that thingsdo not exist which do exist, it would seem to me that a hair of the dogmight be the best course of action. In short, if a person really believedthey could be successful, they wouldn't need you to tell them, \"Of courseyou can be successful.\" It seems ridiculous that somebody becomes, letus say, a psychiatrist or a psychologist with years and years of schooling,and spends time telling a patient something obvious such as, \"Of courseyou can be successful. There are opportunities in this world.\" So, the realproblem is how to interrupt the pattern of behavior that continues to rein-force the belief system, and how to help the patient examine their ownbelief system, to help them acknowledge other choices that are availablein the world.While we will specifically with the application of these principleslater in this book, a selected case will help you to tie together what youhave learned thus far. If you find yourself still tied to the past, this casewill help you cut that cord right at the Knot yesterday but now!PATTERNS: BELIEF SYSTEMS — CASE STUDYI was asked to see a man who was suffering with intractable painresulting from cancer that had metastasized throughout his skeletal sys-tem. Other than his name, age and diagnosis, the only other information Ihad was: the pain had become so severe that he was talking about sui-cide; medication was becoming less and less effective; he was willing tosee a hypnotist, but he doubted that hypnosis or anything would help.Based on this information, I reasoned that asking him to relax in order tobecome hypnotized, or to attempt to teach him to control his pain at thestart, or to explain theory to him, would be the height of illogical therapy.I agreed to see the man providing that everyone concerned—except thepatient—would be aware of and accept that I would use unexpected andunorthodox methods.When I arrived at his home, I was taken immediately to his denwhere I found him standing up, hunched over and evidencing great pain.His face was contorted, his body twisted and emaciated. As I walkedtoward him, his physician said, 'This is Doctor Heller, the hypnotist Itold you about.\" With a feeble and apparently painful movement, he puthis hand out to shake mine. I pushed his hand to the side with the heel ofPatternsIOImy right hand and I hit him on the forehead with enough force to jar him.He stared at me with shock and disbelief on his face and said, \"What didyou do that for?\" Using a harsh tone of voice I said, \"Shut up unless I askyou.\" (Leaving what I might ask unspoken). At this point, he was stand-ing up almost straight and his look of disbelief and shock was even moreapparent.I went on in the same tone and said, \"I am now going to stomp on thetop of your foot and break all the little bones.\" He said in a pleadingvoice, \"Please don't hurt me.\" I replied harshly, \"I have to hurt you,\" andwith that, I raised my right foot over his left. His voice which was nolonger weak said, \"Don't.\" I replied even more harshly, \"Shut your eyes,take a deep breath and relax... I can't hurt a man when his eyes areclosed.\" He closed his eyes in one split second, took a deep breath andslowly exhaled. As he exhaled, I began to talk softly, his face relaxed,then his body, and, within a moment, he was not only comfortable (hehad escaped me), but somehow he had entered into a profound hypnoticstate.CASE EXPLANATIONYou might be wondering about the crazy behavior just described.Good question; I'm glad you asked. Since the man's present problemwas intractable pain, I could assume that, at least in his present situation,he was in his kinesthetic system. As stated earlier, you must go whereyour patient is: that is, meet them in their world. Therefore, I knew Iwould not only need to begin in some kinesthetic way, but in a mannerthat would supersede his kinesthetic reality. I also knew that his beliefsystem included: he had pain; it was getting worse; nothing was going tohelp; everyone was trying to make me feel better, but to no avail. I couldfurther assume that he had patterned expectations about doctors, whatthey do and how they act, as well as to his pain itself.The pain pattern would include putting all or most of his attention onthe pain, expecting it to get worse, becoming more anxious and de-pressed, feeling hopeless and thereby increasing his pain perception. Mybehavior interrupted his patterns; his attention went from his pain to mycrazy behavior; he stopped worrying about what he felt and began worry-ing about what I would do and what he would feel as a result. My behav-ior was a \"shade\" different from what he expected based on his Reliefabout doctors; everyone was trying to help him feel less pain, while Iseemed to be hell-bent on causing him more. Since the human organism"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"102Monsters & Magical SticksPatterns103is designed to protect itself, the moment he was given the option toprotect himself (shut your eyes, take a deep breath, etc.) he took it. Assoon as he closed his eyes, several of his past beliefs had changed orwere changing. By closing his eyes, he could stop something from hap-pening instead of believing he couldn't do anything to help himself; hisbelief system about his pain began to change.Once he closed his eyes and began to relax, his level of pain low-ered—something he hadn't believed possible. He learned he could avoidmore pain, which also taught him he could have less and he could controlsomething to do with pain. Most of his new discoveries were inferential:\"shut your eyes, etc.,\" equaled you can do something to avoid more pain(my stomping on him). If you can feel less and avoid pain, you can con-trol pain. Last, but not least, when I said, \"Shut up unless I ask,\" theresponse was not connected to what he had asked. The words \"shut up\"and \"unless I ask\" implied he was to shut up and I would ask somethingof him. As a result of this \"subtle\" approach, the patient not only becamecomfortable and discovered hope, he was also able to learn self-hypnosis,to change his kinesthetic pain to visual pictures, and to disassociate fromhis body.PATTERNS: PRACTICENow, I am going to ask those of you who are people-helpers to inter-rupt your patterns, as well as the patterns of your clients/patients. Theseexercises should help you expand your belief systems or merely changethem.Pay attention to the body positions your clients/patients assume whenthey are discussing problems, and compare that with their positions whenthey are discussing something pleasant. Next, when they get into problemareas, politely interrupt them, and help them to assume the position theyuse when talking about pleasant things. They, and you, may find thatthey have trouble getting back to the problem. Ask a few patients to talkabout their problems in one specific chair and to move from that chair forall other conversations. Observe the changes as they move from onechair to another. Next, when they discuss a problem, interrupt and havethem describe a pleasant vacation or something they do well. Askanother patient to laugh and smile as he discusses a problem and observewhat happens.As for the therapist, switch chairs with your patient; look away froma patient during problem talk and make eye contact during pleasant con-versations; cough repeatedly during problem talk; smile during pleasanttalk and nod your head. You may discover that your patient begins tounderstand, on an unconscious level, that feeling good, and thinkingpleasant thoughts, gets your attention. Use non-sequiturs:Doctor, I've been very depressed.PT:DR:PT:DR:Speaking of baseball, who do you think will win the worldseries? And, while you are doing that, take several deep breathsbefore you close your eyes.I've been very depressed.Splendid! I'm glad you're getting it out of the way. By the way,where did you go for your high school graduation?Begin to observe your way of relating to patients. How do you greetpeople? Vary it. What facial expressions do you rely on? Mix them upand practice new ones. Learn to use certain tonal and speed patternswhen discussing pleasant topics. Then, when your patient is in a badplace, use your pleasant tonal pattern. Without your patient's consciousawareness, you interrupt their pain-producing pattern and they willusually cheer right up. Remember, there's no such thing as hypnosiswithout trance, or patterns without blueprints...or maybe there is."},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"Left Meets Right Meets Left105XLeft Meets Right Meets LeftTWO BRAINSIf asked, most people would insist that they are rational and that theywould respond to reality. I would ask of them: \"Which reality?\" Withineach of us there reside (at least) two separate, distinct, different and equalrealities. One \"reality\" is that of the left hemisphere of the brain (LH)and the other is that of the right hemisphere (RH).Professor Betty Edwards (1978) conveys the general consensus ofbrain researches when she states that not only do the two hemispheresspecialize, they also perceive reality in their own unique way. The lefthemisphere specializes in verbal skills, numbers, analytical thinking andlinear, digital reasoning. The right hemisphere specializes in spatiality,visual imagery, imagination, color, rhythm, kinesthetic experience, andcreativity (Ornstein, 1973; Edwards, 1978; Buzan and Dixon, 1978). AsRobert Ornstein (1972) puts it:Both the structure and function of these two \"half brains\" in somepart underline the two modes of consciousness which simultaneouslycoexist within each one of us. Although each hemisphere shares thepotential for many functions, and both sides participate in most activi-ties, in the normal person the two hemispheres tend to specialize.When you see someone you already know, your left hemisphere rec-ognizes each specific feature: i.e., the nose, mouth, eyes, etc. However, ifonly your left hemisphere were operating, you would not be able to rec-ognize the whole. Your right hemisphere, with its spatial and conceptualability, takes the specific pieces and makes a whole. Dr. Roger Sperry ofthe California Institute of Technology, along with his associates Joseph104Bogen, Michael Gazzaneza, et al., have demonstrated this concept intheir research with split brain patients (epileptics in which the corpuscallosum—the arched bridge of nervous tissue that connects the twocerebral hemispheres and allows communication between the right andleft sides of the brain—has been surgically cut).SPERRY: SPLIT BRAIN RESEARCHIn one of the now classical experiments by the Sperry group, splitbrain patients were given the task of assembling a jigsaw puzzle whilethey were in a situation that allowed only left-hemisphere function. Filmsof these experiments show the patient struggling with the pieces and thenfailing to put the pieces where they belong. One film shows an evenmore provocative phenomenon: One subject was busy trying to findwhere the pieces went using his right hand (left hemisphere) and sud-denly, without his left-hemisphere awareness, he received help. The filmshows his left hand (right hemisphere) sneaking into the picture and cor-recting the right hand until the experimenter forces the intruder away.HEMISPHERIC CYCLESPsychologists at Dalhousie University have been investigating whatis termed the 90-minute cycle of the brain. During their research, theyhave been able to verify a specific hemispheric pattern: When left-hemi-sphere activities are at their peak, right-hemisphere activities are at theirlowest ebb. Conversely, when right-hemispheric activities are at theirpeak, left-hemisphere activity is at its lowest ebb.Since different tasks require different hemispheric activity, we mightwonder what would happen if one were to over rely on one hemisphereand under utilize the other; or rely on the wrong hemisphere for the taskat hand. (As you continue to wonder, the possible answers will becomeclear.) In their book, The Evolving Brain, Buzan and Dixon (cited)demonstrate an historical trend in which western societies have continuedto place a greater emphasis on left-hemisphere functions while tending toignore and denigrate right-hemisphere aspects: \"Western society hasplaced a greater emphasis on the scientific and analytical side of mentalfunctioning than it has on the more colorful and imaginistic side.\"They also build a strong case for \"united we stand, divided we fall\"as to the relationship of hemispheric functions. Since different tasks andactivities require different mental skills, it would stand to reason thatboth hemispheres are required if we are to move toward our unique"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"io6Monsters & Magical Stickspotentials. Conversely, I believe there is a direct correlation betweenover reliance on left hemisphere and instability, suicide and craziness. Itis almost as if the right hemisphere, finding itself imprisoned, attempts tobreak out of \"jail\" in any way it knows how.[The brain] can love and hate together, it can be calculating andirrational at the same time, it can value trees and enjoy the endlessnewsprint which is destroying them. It has a left and right hemispherewhich only appears to oppose when one is used at the \"expense of theother.\"   — Buzan and Dixon 1978, p. 129To reverse the trend toward over utilization of one hemisphere at\"the expense of the other,\" I believe left must meet right must meet left.In discussing split brain patients, Ornstein (1972, p. 76) drew a paral-lel between the results of a surgical disconnection of hemispheres, andthe results of a so-called emotional disconnect when he stated:In this instance, a clear split was observed between the two inde-pendent consciousnesses that are normally in communication andcollaboration. In such experiments with split brain patients, we canaccurately localize the split of information in the system. A similarprocess, although much more difficult to localize, may underlie theclassic Freudian symptoms of repression and denial, both situations inwhich the verbal mechanism has no access to emotional information inother parts of the system. In less pathological instances, when we per-form an action \"intuitively,\" our words often make no sense, perhapsbecause the action has been initiated by a part of the brain littleinvolved in language.HEMISPHERIC: OVERVIEWWhile brain hemispheric research has demonstrated that both hemi-spheres have the raw potential of the other, in practicality, the right hemi-sphere has very little in the way of developed verbal skill. Where certainstroke victims have been helped to speak again, through right-hemi-spheric training, they begin speaking at about the level of a five-year-oldchild. Therefore, while it is probably safe to assume that the left hemi-sphere speaks for us, it is not safe to assume that the right hemispheredoes not communicate.On the contrary, the right hemisphere communicates in many ways,some delightful and graceful, and others painful: dreams, fantasies,Left Meets Right Meets Left107hunches, \"gut feelings\" and kinesthetic memories, to name but a few. Allof the communication methods of the right hemisphere are important,but, for the purposes of this work, we will focus on two forms of right-hemispheric communications.First, there is mounting evidence that the right hemisphere, with itsbuilt-in ability to effect and mediate autonomic nervous system pro-cesses, is responsible for the formation of so-called psychosomatic orpsychogenic symptomology (Furia, 1973; Galin, 1974; Erickson andRossi, 1979) and that these symptoms are a metaphoric communicationof the right hemisphere (Erickson, Rossi & Rossi, 1979; Heller Meta 4Change, in work).Secondly, in my opinion, we do not develop any behavior, no matterhow bizarre, unless at some point in our history we come to \"believe,\" atsome level, that the behavior was necessary to protect ourselves in thebest way we knew at the time. Therefore, so-called irrational fears, anxi-eties and depressions are messages from our right-hemispheric memorybank that we are entering into \"real or imagined\" danger zones.If, as many brain researchers contend, western cultures are beginningto rely on over utilization of the left hemisphere, what are the possibleconsequences to the individual? Empirical observation and review mightbe a very rewarding learning experience as well as the beginning of ananswer. I would ask you to observe the people around you with specialemphasis in the therapeutic situation. I believe you will discover thatthose individuals who would fit into the so-called \"rigid compulsive\"and/or \"perfectionist\" category: will evidence over utilization of left-hemispheric skills; are logical to the extreme (once you believe a turtle isa horse you may very logically attempt to saddle and ride it); are analyti-cal about nearly everything (try making love analytically by the num-bers); lack general spontaneity; tend to seriousness often without a well-developed sense of humor; tend to plan all activities in minute detail.These left-hemispheric individuals will often be your typical ulcer,heart attack or alcoholic patient, as if their right hemisphere was trying toescape. On the other hand, you will discover that those individuals whofit under the categories of \"impulsive,\" \"hysterical,\" \"hysterical conver-sion,\" \"acting out behavior\" and even \"crazy\" are evidencing almost totalright-hemispheric activity. It is as if they have given up trying to livewithin the narrow confines of left hemisphere, and have escaped into thefantasy world of right hemisphere. (Some researchers have postulatedthat schizophrenia is merely the dream process acted out in \"reality.\")"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"108Monsters & Magical SticksI'm not suggesting that all people will fit neatly into the above righthemisphere/left hemisphere categories. However, many will come closeenough to give you pause for thought.The way an individual deals with a situation either analytically,holistically or a mixture of the two, apparently reflects the brain's style.Reliance on \"left brain\" strategies in all situations would characterizean extremely analytical person. A right-brained person, in contrast,appears more emotional and rarely analyzes.— Brain Mind Bulletin, January 7, 1980, Vol. 5, No. 4HEMISPHERIC: BELIEF SYSTEMSAnother major consideration as to a dichotomy between right hemi-sphere and left hemisphere concerns belief systems. The individuallocked into left hemisphere will tend to take the same facts and apply thesame logical sequences to arrive at the same painful solution and, fromthat, logically conclude their belief is accurate. After all, if a computer ismisprogrammed, it will rapidly and perfectly arrive at the wrong answer.A \"mythical\" example might make the point more clear. Quite often,left-hemisphere types fear any loss of control and believe they will dosomething \"wrong,\" bad, or foolish. The stress of being a living com-puter might lead them to escape by getting drunk, thus freeing righthemisphere without any limitations. When they logically survey theresults of their drunkenness, they become convinced of the danger of notbeing logical and acting logically. This reinforces the very belief systemthat prevents them from mediating their behavior and choices. We coulddemonstrate the same process in reverse for the individual who hasescaped into right hemisphere and continues to find \"proof\" to supporttheir belief system that they cannot be organized, logical or disciplined.Now, what of the individual who falls into that category known aswell-adjusted or self-actualized? (Maslow, 1975) Will they tend toward agraceful, eclectic and flexible mixture of both right hemisphere and lefthemisphere? Able to make plans and then follow through? Reasonablywell-organized but flexible enough to give up what doesn't work and trysomething new? Will they tend to use creative approaches to work andplay rather than follow the same proven steps? Will they be spontaneouswith a well-developed sense of humor?You will have to look and listen for yourself until it fits for you. Youmay discover that these individuals have the ability to be a rational, logi-left Meets Right Meets Leftcal adult where that is required; a happy spontaneous explorative childwhere that is the better choice, and both when both are most appropriate.GOAL: HEMISPHERIC BALANCEIf, from the preceding, you have jumped to the conclusion that help-ing individuals to become more hemispherically balanced is yourgoal...you've made a good jump! Review your own history as to thoseareas you handle well. You will no doubt discover—as to those areas—abalance between spontaneous creativity and disciplined goal direction.Or, turning right and left at the same time.Now, review some of your therapeutic successes in which yourclient/patient \"got it together.\" It may become clear that, as those indi-viduals moved toward their therapeutic goal, they not only broke self-defeating patterns, they also moved closer to reciprocal hemisphericutilization. In his book, The Furthest Reaches of Human Nature, Abra-ham Maslow described the self-actualized individual as the highest ofachievements. Paraphrasing Maslow, he stated that the self-actualizedindividual has the ability to leave behind everyday reality in order todelve fully into his creative process, decide to return to reality, choosewhat can be and then plan to work to make it happen. If we translate thisinto the language of our discussion, it might be stated that the self-actual-ized individual has the ability to put aside left-hemisphere activity toexplore fully right-hemisphere activity, and then utilize left hemisphereto bring right-hemisphere creativity to fruition. Ornstein (1972) has pre-dicted that if each side of the brain is utilized, both sides will producemore than if only one side is used. As in the concept of synergy the sumof the parts will be more than the parts themselves.HEMISPHERES: HYPNOSISHypnosis, by its very nature, may be one of the most effective waysof helping someone toward hemispheric balance and self-actualization.Hemispheric research amply demonstrates that as an individual entersinto an altered state, his right hemisphere becomes more active, while theleft hemisphere rests. In such a state, right hemisphere processes becomemore evident and the individual finds it more acceptable to acknowledgethat process. Since hypnosis is an imaginistic state that produces sensoryresponses (Erickson and Rossi, 1979; Kroger, 1976; Wolberg, 1964), theindividual finds himself fully involved in his \"other reality,\" therebyopening channels of communication between left and right. In most"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"noMonsters & Magical SticksLeft Meets Right Meets LeftI I Icases, the hypnotic state produces, if not a change in left-hemispherebeliefs, at least a substantial putting aside and questioning of left-hemi-sphere beliefs and limitations.Ask a hypnotically naive individual if they believe they could anes-thetize their arm by thinking certain words. Most would express doubt.After experiencing hypnotic anesthesia, they can never again have theirprior belief. All the facts in the world will not convince them so thor-oughly as their awareness of their experience. Those of you who utilizehypnosis can verify that statement. Remember the surprise a subject hasexpressed after a hand levitation.HEMISPHERIC AMNESIAAs stated elsewhere, chronic pain patients claim they always havepain. Since their left-hemisphere reality is one of remembering pain,where there is no pain there is nothing for them to remember. They haveamnesia for no-pain (Erickson and Rossi, 1979). In the same vein, mostof us have little or no left-hemisphere memory for all the ways we utilizehemispheric balance gracefully and efficaciously. Even so-called\"dysfunctioning\" people have such a balance in the trouble-free areas oftheir lives. Since their left-hemisphere reality is focused and locked intotheir problem where there is little or no balance, they tend to have forgot-ten all of their balanced areas: driving a car, riding a bicycle, reading,writing, recognizing a friend, tying shoelaces, and on and on.It has been estimated that individuals handle at least 70-80% of life'srequirements effectively. It is the 20%, 30% or, in some cases 40%, thathave forgotten how to turn right and left at the same time. The hypnoticstate, by its release of imaginistic recall and fantasy, can be used to helpthem to not only re-experience themselves using those areas of success-ful balance, but to also \"see and feel\" themselves using those skills tosolve their problems. Helping an individual to \"relive\" learning to ride abicycle, to read and write, to tie shoelaces—situations in which they oncedoubted their abilities—helps to interrupt their left-hemisphere limita-tions.CASE 8: INTRODUCTIONTo underscore the efficacy of hypnotic utilization, I will present acase that required just two sessions to achieve the patient's therapeuticgoal. While several factors were involved in the successful outcome, theuse of hypnotic fantasy and right-hemisphere memories of competencywere the key elements.The patient was a recently divorced man, 30 years of age. His com-plaint was of being afraid to approach women; he believed he lacked theconfidence to learn how. Early in the first session, he had stated, \"I can'tsee myself approaching a woman, no way! I'm afraid I'll look foolish,and that really scares me.\" On a more positive note, he considered him-self an excellent tennis player.Translating his stated complaint into the language of our discussion,I would state his problem as follows: His \"logical\" or left-hemisphereexperience and belief was that he could not be successful approaching awoman, that he \"knew\" he would look foolish. Individuals who over relyon left-hemispheric functions (either in general or in the problem area)tend toward strong fears of appearing foolish and tend not to use theircreative imagination (right hemisphere) as a method of solving theirproblem. They tend to take the same facts, follow them in the samesequence and end up in the same stuck place. On the other hand, he feltgood about his ability to play tennis.Since at some point in time he was not skillful at tennis, he musthave, in that situation at least, found a way of overcoming his fear oflooking foolish. Stated in another way, within his memory banks (right-hemispheric experience) was the skill of feeling confident (at tennis) andof being able to learn something new. The task, therefore, was to helphim break out of his left-hemispheric limitations and to help him utilizehis right-hemisphere creative imagination to find a new way of solvinghis problem.Since hypnosis results in more right-hemispheric activity whilereducing the activity of the left hemisphere (getting the individual out oftheir own way), a combination of hypnosis and what Erickson has termed\"embedded suggestion\" was utilized. The purpose was to free his cre-ative imagination, enable him to experience his (tennis) confidence, andenable him to generalize that confidence to the problem area.CASE 8: TENNISThe following is an edited transcript of the important elements of histwo sessions:DR: So you have confidence in your ability to play tennis?PT: Yes!

I'm afraid I'll look foolish.\" Those statements indicated that,at least in his problem area, he was stuck in his visual system—that is, hemade visual pictures (V) of some future disaster with women, probablybased on some prior visual learning, and then he feels (K) in response tothose pictures. In effect, his internal reality became more real than hisexternal reality.I'm not sure I see what you mean, but I guess it's a feeling Ihave.[Dr.'s head tilts slightly to his right, directing the next commu-nication to the patient's left ear (RH) with slower speech andlower tonality.

This uses his real life expectations and experiencesto help trigger a new response.PT: [Smiling] You mean I know how to be confident, I just forget.[Indicating he is integrating the unconscious suggestion.]DR: THAT'S RIGHT!

This theme was repeated several timeswhile discussing the skills of tennis: learning to serve, learning to have asmooth backhand, etc. Since the patient already knew all this, it washoped he would become bored consciously, and since he knew what hewanted—confidence in regards to women—he would take the importantparts of the message—practice leads to skill and confidence—and applyit to his goal. (Erickson, Rossi and Rossi, 1979) During this seeminglyrepetitive conversation, I began a formal induction:DR: One of the important skills you've learned automatically towatch the ball with interest.

While no formal followup was attempted, this patient referred several people, one of whomrelayed the message that things were great and he was getting better allthe time, just like his tennis game!XIReality ... Really???CONSENSUAL REALMScientists who study human behavior have argued, and continue toargue, as to what constitutes \"reality\"; if there is a reality, why a reality,and...ad nauseam. In spite of this debate, one general consensus hascome into being: There exists a \"consensual reality.\" As the nameimplies, it refers to a consensus, or general agreement, as to what to callcertain things and how generally we should respond to those things. We,at least in our society, generally agree that a chair is a chair, and what wecan do with a chair (careful...).We know that we can't, at least at this point in our development, flapour arms and fly. We all agree that a beach is a beach, a tree is a tree, etc.In a very narrow sense, we might state that consensual reality is primarilya function of conscious processes: that is, I see a tree and accept theobject as a tree. Unless one of us is marching to a very differentdrummer, you would agree that a tree is just that—a tree. Thus, we haveconsensual agreement as to the reality of that tree. However, ourindividual response to that tree may be more important than ouragreement.A tree is a tree—although its meaning to the man who views it(\"the truth\") depends upon his relationship to it. Does it give him fruitor shade, or is it an obstacle in his path?— Surveying Kierkegaard, Homer and Buhler, 1969INTERNAL REALITYOur internal (subjective) reality, and, therefore, our response to thattree may be entirely different from that of another person. This factor119"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"120Monsters & Magical Sticks(internal reality) contributes to our individual uniqueness. No two peoplewill perceive or respond to the beach in exactly the same way; no twopeople perceive and respond in the same way to a painting. I believe thatour internal realities make for a exciting differences among all of us. Ifnot for this \"reality,\" we would all be gray-flannel, button-down, pin-striped people, or some other stereotype.A man enters a room. Across the room he sees a woman. He beginsto experience strong arousal and finds himself powerfully attracted toher. Now, consciously, he is only seeing certain physical characteristics:perhaps blond hair, blue eyes, a nice figure, or whatever. (Men, feel freeto alter the above description, and women, fill in your own favoritefantasy.)There may be many other women in the room, and we mightconsensually agree that they are all at least as attractive as that onewoman. In spite of that, our hero stands there having his powerfulexperience, and is almost oblivious to the other women. In allprobability, he is unaware that in his inner reality, he is responding to awhole past history of unconscious associations. Perhaps her hair is thesame as his first puppy love; her lips are like those of the first girl he everkissed; her smile is that of the first woman he ever had sex with. In\"reality\" he is not responding to her at all. In effect, \"seeing\" her causedhim to regress through his history and past experiences with women, andhis inner \"reality\" then became more \"real\" and important than his outeror consensual reality.Within his consensual reality, there is no knowledge of that woman,who she is, what she likes or is like; in fact, she may have a personalityhe can't stand. In spite of all that, he is standing there—his heart beatingrapidly, his palms sweating, his mind locked totally on her—while he isdesperately trying to figure out ways of meeting her. You might...NOWASK YOURSELF...which reality is real...at least for him?Everything we see, feel, hear and \"know\" is tempered, perceived,filtered and responded to based on our internal belief systems (seeChapter V). The way we have learned to see, interpret and respond isindividual for each of us. The unconscious mind's \"inner reality\" may beentirely different from that of our conscious mind's consensual \"reality.\"In his work, The Split Brain in Man, Gazzaneza (1967) touched lightlyReality... Really???121on this topic when he stated, \"...it is as if the cranium contained twoseparate spheres of consciousness.\"MONSTERS AND MAGICAL STICKSWhen my son was about three or four, he decided that his baseballand football became monsters at night when the lights were turned off.He \"saw\" them coming to life; they looked evil and they were trying toget him. Now, rationally, that makes no sense at all. Our consensualreality knows that it's not real. My wife and I attempted to explain to himwhat was real and what was not. He listened very intently and when wefinished, he said, \"But they're coming to get me.\" For whatever thereasons, his unconscious mind had created this inner reality, and it hadsuddenly leaped out to become his outer reality. Logical, factual, linear,left-hemispheric explanations accomplished the sum total of nothing.We then decided to become illogical (some might call it creative) tosolve the problem. We went to a local building supply store and obtaineda piece of wood doweling, two feet long and one-half inch in diameter.We wrapped the dowel in purple velvet and put a little gold tassel at oneend. Next we purchased the kind of box one would put roses into andplaced the soon to be \"magic stick\" inside. We brought the box home andexplained to our son that we had been to see a special doctor called themagic doctor. We told him that the magic doctor had made a magic stickthat would scare away all monster balls. We then told him the \"magic\"words that the magic doctor had given us. We explained to him that fortwo or three nights he was to point the magic stick at the monster and saythe magic words.That night we all went into his bedroom and went through a solemnceremony of opening the box and presenting him with the magic stick.He took the stick and, with great determination, went around the room.At each corner of the room he stopped, pointed the magic stick and saidthe magic words. That night he slept without his previous nightmares andsudden awakenings. The second night, he went into his room alone andrepeated the magic ritual. After the third or fourth night, he put the magicstick in a corner and stopped using it. He slept without problems and nolonger talked about monsters.About two weeks later he gave us the stick and said he no longerneeded it. The moral of this story is: Since his unconscious processes,based on his belief systems, created his inner reality of monster balls, ittook his unconscious processes to create an inner reality that believed in"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"122Monsters & Magical Sticksa cure more powerful than the monster balls to solve the problem. Tradi-tional approaches would have entailed reasoning it out and proving thatthe monster balls did not exist, or \"plumbed\" the depth of his feelings; orhelped (?) him to act out his (pick one) fears/angers/hostilities/insecu-rities. Then, in several months (or years), he would have been able tocope with \"The Problem.\" Instead, within a matter of a few days, he notonly learned how to solve the problem.. .he had solved it.CRAZINESS AND CREATIVITYTo me, the unconscious mind and its inner reality is a fascinatingcreative, dynamic and exciting place. It has been said that theunconscious process is similar to that of the schizophrenic process. Ibelieve, however, that the so-called schizophrenic process, directedtoward the solving of problems and the discovery of that which is new, isthe creative process. This same process, turned toward buildinglimitations and fears, can be called \"craziness.\" To paraphrase GeorgeSantayana: Creativity is merely craziness put to good use.Another personal story might make the point even more clear. Manyyears ago, we lived on the second floor of a two-story apartmentbuilding. My daughter, who was three at the time, had developed thehabit of jumping off her bed over and over, playing some private gamethat only she understood. One night, our downstairs neighbor came up tocomplain about the noise. My wife went into our daughter's room andsaid, \"Don't do that anymore. The man downstairs is getting very angry.\"Later that night our daughter became very upset. When we tried to calmher down, she told us that the man who lived in the rug was mad at herand was going to hurt her. We attempted to explain the concept ofupstairs/downstairs, but she was too young to understand. We even tookher downstairs to show her where the man \"down below\" lived. All shecould or would understand was that the man in the carpeting was mad ather for jumping on him.Now, we adults know that's ridiculous. We adults, we who thinklogically, know that a man can't live in the carpet. We logical adults whothrow salt over our shoulder, who knock on wood when we have goodfortune, who step around ladders and step over cracks, know that thoselittle childish beliefs have nothing to do with us. (That's why this bookhas no Chapter 13. Reality ... Really?)Ideality - Really???123§ IMAGES OF REALITYAs we stated earlier, when a patient enters the therapist's office, he- brings with him his inner belief systems: a process of his past learnings,experiences, and individual realities. This individual lives in basically thesame outer reality as the therapists and has many of the same• opportunities. However, that person's inner reality may be such that he isblocked from seeing the opportunities and options that are available. Ineffect, s/he has been hypnotized, or has hypnotized him/herself, intoseeing that which s/he has already seen, hearing only what s/he hasalready heard, and feeling only that which s/he has already felt....let us remember. We never deal with reality per se, but ratherwith images of reality—that is, with interpretations. While the numberof potentially possible interpretations is very large, our world imagepermits us to see only one—and this one therefore appears to be theonly possible, reasonable, and permitted view. Furthermore, this oneinterpretation also suggests only one possible reasonable and permittedsolution, and if we don't succeed at first, we try and try again—or, inother words, we resort to the recipe of doing more of the same.— Watzlawick, 1978, p. 119The therapist who insists on attacking the patient's belief systemsdirectly is using a hammer as her only tool, and will, as a result, treat thepatient as if he were a nail! Since there could well be an inner reality ofjumping off a bed and causing the man who lives in the carpet to getangry, attacking the patient's belief system directly is not, in most cases,going to help. It may even hurt and result in that great escapeclause... RESISTANCE...Devising an unconscious process that uses the same creativity thatproduced the problem to solve the problem will be a much more effectiveapproach. In addition, it's a lot more fun for the therapist as well as thepatient.HYPNOTIC MONSTERA woman who suffered from severe anxiety whenever she was in arelationship with a man, sought my help. She described her reaction as afeeling of drowning, or suffocating, and claimed she actually experiencedthose sensations physically. She had been working on her problem forjust over two years, and had, in her opinion, made good progress. She"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"124Monsters & Magical Sticks\"understood\" the dynamics, had insight, and felt stronger in handling the\"bad\" feelings. She believed that she was now ready to get rid of theproblem once and for all.She acknowledged that her problem made no sense \"logically.\" Shehad read extensively on the subjects of psychology, therapy, andinterpersonal relationships. In spite of her efforts, she felt stuck and said,\"I'm beginning to lose all hope.\" During her second session I helped herinto the state that doesn't exist—hypnosis. I asked her to \"go back\" to atime when she had experienced those bad feelings and to signal me byraising the first finger of her left hand when she could actually feel thesensations. After she signaled, and was evidencing some discomfort, Itold her to allow her creative mind to create a horrible monster, to see itclearly, and to feel all the fear as it was trying to destroy her.She was then asked to imagine that there was no safe path of escape.Within a few moments, there were obvious signs of discomfort: herbreathing rate increased dramatically, sweat appeared on her foreheadand upper lip, and she was evidencing agitation. At that point, I told herthe following: \"It's up to you to decide whether to knock your monsterout, or to wiggle your nose and chase it away, or to flap your ears andsimply fly away and leave the monster where it belongs—in the past.Now, take your time, because your unconscious mind may want to use acombination of those things, or it may have even better ways.\"Now, we all know that not one of those instructions makes senselogically, and yet, in spite of the nonsense, something began to happen.Within a few moments, she took a few deep breaths and exhaled veryslowly; her body began to relax and then she started to giggle. Fiveminutes later she opened her eyes and smiled a beautiful smile. She toldme that, for some reason, she knew that she didn't have to be afraidanymore, that she didn't understand it, but somehow she had a \"gut\"feeling where the monster came from and how to get rid of it.THE SNOWMAN AS REALITYWhen my daughter was about four years old, my wife and I took herto see snow for the first time. She wanted to build a snowman, and wehelped her to build one that was \"little people\" size—about two and ahalf feet tall. She was very excited and pleased with her creation, and wewere pleased, too. As we drove into our driveway, after returning fromthe mountains, she saw several of her friends playing. She asked me toReality ...Really???125stop the car so she could get out and tell them about the snowman. Shegot out and excitedly began to tell them all about her snowman.As she described it, she painted a picture with her hands that madethe snowman about four feet high. She had almost doubled its height.Two days later we all went to breakfast with my parents. Our daughterbegan to describe her snowman and said, \"Grandpa, I made a snowmanbigger than you.\" My father is about 5'10\", and at the time, quite a bitoverweight. That started me to think about how our imaginations work:To a child, if they are not right there to see it, a snowman gets bigger andbigger. If that's true of a snowman, what about those monsters we builtwhen we were children? They were no more than six inches tall, butwhile we have been running from them all these years, I bet our innerreality has made them forty-seven feet tall, and very, very scary.Since our creative unconscious has built our monsters so big, ourcreative unconscious knows just how to wiggle our nose and reduce themonster to size. But, that's just a different reality... Really!"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"Unconscious Versus Conscious127XIIUnconscious Versus ConsciousAmong my many pet peeves, one stands out: Many people whoutilize hypnosis, as well as therapists of all types, will pay lip service tothe existence of a so-called \"unconscious.\" They will discuss uncon-scious processes, unconscious problems, and unconscious conflicts. Yet,when it comes to doing therapy, they act as if the unconscious doesn'texist. You could safely say that they are unconscious as to unconsciousprocesses.They will attempt to explain to their patients, in specific, logicaldetail, just what the problem and its solution is. Unless they are dealingwith someone from another planet, their patient has probably heard allthe logical advice they could give. The patient has probably heard \"theanswer\" from many sources. If these \"facts\" were the solution, I'm surethey would have solved their problem:Once upon a time, there was a young woman and a young mancrawling around on their hands and knees. They seemed to be searchingdesperately for something. A kind and well-meaning stranger happenedby and asked them, \"What are you looking for?\" They replied, \"We aresearching for some important keys that will unlock important doors inour lives.\" The stranger said, \"That sounds important. Let me help youlook.\" The stranger got down on his/her hands and knees and begansearching for the missing keys. After a long while, the stranger stoppedand said, \"I can't find any keys here... Just where were you standingwhen you lost them?\" The couple replied, \"Oh, about one hundredmiles from here, in an open field.\" The stranger said, \"If you lost themin a field one hundred miles from here, what are we doing searchinghere?\" \"Well,\" said the couple, \"the light is very good here, and wealready know the territory perfectly.\" — Old Sufi tale, updated a littleSUB. VS. UNCONSCIOUSSome individuals prefer the concept of a subconscious mind. I preferthe concept of the unconscious. According to the American HeritageDictionary (Dell Publishing Inc., 1975), the prefix \"sub\" implies lesserthan, beneath or below instead of parallel or equal. I like to believe thatthe \"two minds\" are equal, but different. In the most basic terms, Ibelieve that unconscious mind means that of which we are not (at leastfor the moment) conscious. There are a multitude of processes that webecome aware of (conscious) at different times and circumstances. Thereare many more (processes) that we may never, or only seldom, becomeconscious of. In spite of this lack of \"awareness,\" these processes arethere and ongoing.For example, as you are reading these words, your heart has beenbeating. Until you read that statement, you were probably unconscious asto that process. Some of you may have difficulty experiencing that pro-cess now. But, since you are reading this book, I am assuming that youare alive and, therefore, that process is continuing.\"THE PSYCHOLOGICAL UNCONSCIOUS\"A few years ago, a research paper was published regarding thesubject of unconscious processes. The gist of this paper was, that byflashing words on a screen at a high rate of speed—euphemisticallycalled \"subliminally\"—the subjects would evidence physiologicalresponses without conscious awareness of the words. One experimentincluded the flashing of sexually stimulating material in the midst of avery \"dry\" intellectual movie, again at a speed that prevented the subjectsfrom being \"aware\" of the material. Yet, all of the subjects gave evidenceof strong \"physiological arousal.\" (Scientists must have difficulty sayingturned on.)The researchers, based on the results of these and other so-called\"subliminal experiments,\" concluded that there is an unconscious pro-cess. They further concluded that not only are these (unconscious) pro-, cesses occurring at all times, but we are most often unaware of not onlythe process, but how the process affects us. Howard Shevrin and ScottDickman, in their paper, \"The Psychological Unconscious\" stated,\"...unconscious processes affect ongoing behavior and experience, even•though the experiencer may be unaware of this influence.\" (AmericanPsychologist, 1980, Vol. 35, Number 5, 421-434.)726"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"128Monsters & Magical SticksUnconscious Versus ConsciousDr. Milton Erickson, who has insisted for years that there is an un-conscious process, upon hearing about the above \"discovery\" said, (thisis a paraphrase), \"I'm not surprised that the scientific community isfinally acknowledging the existence of the unconscious. What does sur-prise me is that they still insist that there is a conscious mind!\" There aresome mind/brain researchers who claim that so-called conscious reality isreally a gift from our unconscious mind; that is, only when our uncon-scious mind makes our conscious mind aware of something, does thatsomething become part of our reality.A LIEWhat you are now about to read is a lie! I believe that it will be auseful lie. If you will recall the material from Chapter X, \"Left MeetsRight Meets Left,\" it was pointed out that the two hemispheres of thebrain specialize. To recap briefly, the left, or so-called dominant, hemi-sphere deals with linear, digital, analytical and logical processes. Theright hemisphere's domain is spatiality, imagery, color perception, kines-thetic recall, and creativity; it may be called the metaphoric mind.I would like you to... ACCEPT NOW., .the lie that the left hemispheremay be conceptualized as the conscious mind, while the right hemisphereis the home of the unconscious mind. If you accept this untruth, you willbe in very good company. There are many mind/brain researchers andscientists who accept, and even spread, this lie. They might even say thatwhat we call unconscious processes match nicely with what is knownabout right-hemispheric activity, and ditto for conscious processes/lefthemisphere. Technically, it might be more accurate to state that bothhemispheres engage in unconscious and conscious processes, and thatneither hemisphere works totally independently of the other. Rather,there is a consistent interaction and interchange between the two. Inreferring to the \"location\" of the consciousness and memory, Buzan andDixon (cited) stated:It becomes clear in fact, that such elusive phenomena were in someway distributed throughout the brain as a whole.... However, someresearchers of brain phenomena now make a distinction between mindand brain in what is termed the mind/brain dualism. If, in fact, such adualism exists, scientists are not yet close to identifying where onestarts and the other leaves off.I2gRemember, I said that what you were going to read is a lie—so theabove may be a lie also!UNCONSCIOUS/CONSCIOUS/METAPHORWhile a separate left hemisphere/conscious mind and a right hemi-sphere/unconscious mind may or may not exist, I find it a useful meta-phor for my work with hypnosis. When engaged in so-called \"consciouswork,\" I use facts, logic, and reason. When I move to \"doing hypnosis,\" Iuse stories, imaginistic recall, nonsense suggestions and fantasy—inshort, \"the language of the unconscious.\"I also accept that the two \"minds\" work in concert—when not work-ing in opposition. For example, you consciously see an individual stand-ing on a street corner. Your unconscious mind takes the total picture andgoes through its file cabinet of memories, and comes up with a recogni-tion. This recognition is then sent to your conscious mind and you\"recognize\" a friend you haven't seen in years.An example we have all experienced: We are introduced to someonenew. Several hours later we try to recall their name, but to no avail. Wehave \"forgotten.\" We struggle for a while and then say, \"To hell with it.\"Later, as we are busy at some other task, the name suddenly \"pops\" intoour (conscious) mind. We weren't even aware of the process of remem-bering. This is a simple, but descriptive, example of one unconsciousprocess. However, there are many other unconscious processes that maynot be so innocuous. They may even be painful.UNCONSCIOUS PROTECTIONDr. Milton Erickson has steadfastly contended that the unconsciousalways protects the conscious and the total organism. While I wouldagree in general, I would add an important corollary. The unconsciousalways protects the individual the best way it \"knows\" how, within theframework of its reality, and the rules followed by the conscious mindand its reality.The methods of the unconscious may have once been useful, or mayhave been the best choice available at another time, or the best \"allowed\"at another time. That is no guarantee that its \"protection\" is in the indi-vidual's present best interest! In other situations, the unconscious mayhave \"a better method,\" but the belief systems of the conscious mind maydeny, block or ignore the message of the unconscious."},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"130Monsters & Magical SticksUnconscious Versus ConsciousI belief that, where the unconscious does not have an easy channel ofcommunication to the conscious mind, or where its messages are deniedor ignored, it will find a way to make itself known. Symptomology(physical or emotional) may be one such group of ways. Where recipro-cal communication between the two \"minds\" is severed via the surgeriesof past traumas, past learning, fears about \"losing control,\" etc., will thatbe where the unconscious is \"forced\" to sneak into the picture for thepurpose of \"rearranging\" the pieces of that individual's puzzle? Will theconscious mind push the intruder away? Will the individual find himselfresponding in ways that are not acceptable to his conscious understand-ing? Will that lead to anxiety? Will that lead to more conscious controland denial of the unconscious message? Will that result in the uncon-scious increasing its efforts to \"protect\" by becoming more insistent?SYMPTOM: TENSION HEADACHEFor a possible answer to the above questions, we need only examinethe symptom known as tension headache. Most medical experts wouldagree that, in the absence of physical pathology, such headaches occurfrom impaired circulation and building pressure when increasing muscletension is ignored. I would like you to consider this causative chain ofevents from the metaphoric concept of Right Hemisphere/LeftHemisphere—Conscious/Unconscious processes.You have been hard at work at some task, and without your\"awareness\" your mind and body are tired. Your unconscious recognizesyour need for a work break, and it \"communicates\" this informationthrough one of its languages: i.e., kinesthetic signals. Your back and necktighten up. You either ignore or are unaware of the message, and so youcontinue to work. Your unconscious, in its effort to \"protect\" you,increases its message. The message gets stronger; more tightness affect-ing more of your body, and then.. .HEADACHE! You can't concentrate,your eyes ache, your head pounds, and you are forced to take a break—which is what your unconscious wanted in the first place. You could saythat an individual's unconscious, under the right conditions, could evenmake them crazy in order to protect them. I hope that the following twobrief case histories will be useful in underlining the message.CASE 9: HEADACHEA man was referred to me who had a long history of so-calledtension headaches. He averaged three to four severe headaches a day. Hetended to be a compulsive individual in all of his activities, but more sowhen it came to \"keeping on top of my work.\" I asked him to imaginethe following: that he had a very urgent message for a friend, and that hewent to his friend's house to deliver it. He knew his friend was home, sohe rang the doorbell but no one answered. I asked him what he would do,assuming the message had to be delivered. He replied that he would pushthe doorbell and hold it, and if that didn't work, he would pound on thedoor and shout his friend's name.I asked him to consider that his unconscious had an important mes-sage for him, tried knocking on his \"door\" and, when he didn't answer,his unconscious then started to pound.. .HEADACHE! He was then askedto close his eyes and let his creative imagination produce a clear pictureof that part of him that was sending the message, and to signal me whenhe had done so. He was then instructed to \"ask\" that part what signalwould be acceptable for him to acknowledge. That part told him torespond to tension in the neck. I then suggested that he become moreaware of that signal and, as soon as he felt that message, he was to stop,take several deep breaths, and then take a 10 to 15 minute break. I askedhim to ask that part if that method would be acceptable, and if it was, itwould be time for him to return to my office. (Somehow during theseprocedures, he had entered into what looked a lot like a hypnotic state.)He opened his eyes about ten minutes later and said, \"It said 'yes,'but if I don't keep my promise, it reserves the right to give me aheadache.\" This simple procedure resulted in an 80% reduction of hissymptoms within two weeks. He was then helped, while in the hypnoticstate, to become more aware of his kinesthetic signals in general, and totake more frequent breaks. Within six weeks he was symptom free andhas remained so. In addition, he reported that his work performanceimproved.CASE 10: BEE PHOBIAA woman complained of the following problem: About six monthsprior to seeing me she had developed an almost phobic response to thebuzzing of bees. She told me, \"They're starting to drive me crazy.\" Afterestablishing what is known in the \"trade\" as an \"anchor of comfort\"(anchors are explained in Chapters XVI), I had her hold on to the feelingof comfort while she \"saw\" a bee at a safe distance. I asked her to thenhear the buzzing while she held on to the feeling of comfort, and to listen"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"132Monsters & Magical Sticksto the sound as it changed into words; that the words would tell her whatit was that her unconscious was trying to tell her.After about fifteen minutes, she opened her eyes and said, \"I'm notsurprised.\" She told me that the bee slowly turned into her husband whowas always correcting her and putting her down; and that his voice wasjust like the sound of a bee. (Remember, this is her unconscious process,even if it was different than I had instructed.) She went on to tell me thatshe was very unhappy in her marriage, but she tried to \"pretendeverything is great.\" I explained to her that she could fool some of thepeople all the time, and all the people some of the time, but that shecouldn't fool her unconscious for even a moment. She told me that shewas afraid that the \"buzzing\" would drive her crazy. I told her to givesome thought about talking to her husband about her dissatisfaction, andeven to consider marriage counseling. She called me a week later to tellme that the buzzing no longer concerned her; that as soon as she hadtalked to her husband, she could feel the fear \"fall away.\"WILD CLAIMSFor at least 150 years, hypnotists have been making wild, unscientificand unsupported claims regarding hypnosis, conscious and unconsciousprocesses. They have claimed that the rules governing unconsciousbehavior and responses are different from those that control consciousprocesses: (\"...unconscious processes may follow different principles oforganization than those that characterize psychological processes occur-ring during the normal, waking state of consciousness.\" (Shevrin andDickman, 1980).These old time hypnotists developed what later became known as the\"elevator theory\": entering into hypnosis causes the unconscious to riseabove the conscious and to become more active; while in the wakingstate, the conscious is at the higher level. Work on the 90 minute cycle ofthe brain and experiments with subliminal communication tends to sub-stantiate that wild theory. Old time hypnotists held that the unconsciouswas always \"paying attention\" and \"knew\" everything that was going on.Shevrin and Dickman have synthesized many works that support thatclaim. Many surgeons are now taught that, while the patient may be \"outcold,\" they may still record what is said in the surgery theater. Manyhypnotists have had the experience of taking a subject back, while inhypnosis, to a surgery, and having the subject recall what was said.Milton Erickson has claimed that you can communicate to the uncon-Unconscious Versus Conscious133scious separately from the conscious. His method was via stories, meta-phors and talking to one ear for unconscious communication and theother ear for conscious messages.Another wild claim by a hypnotist...and yet... \"generally, subjectsare unaware of the stimuli in the unattended ear, although these stimuliexercise an influence on various response parameters of the attendedstimuli.\" (Shevrin and Dickman). Hypnotists have held that the uncon-scious is the storehouse of our entire history and experience; the root ofour problems as well as the source of the solutions. Modern research,scientific instruments, and empirical observation have begun to provehow often those old time hypnotists were right on target. We might saythat they knew how to turn left and right at the same time.In my opinion, our highly structured society relies far too much onthe logical, digital conscious part of our experience, and far too little onthe creative unconscious experience. Some brain theorists have estimatedthat the conscious mind is capable of doing three to five unimportanttasks at one time, and only one or two important ones. At the same time,they estimate that the unconscious is capable of doing several thousandtasks at the same time.I'm not claiming that the conscious mind is not important. What I doclaim is that the average individual has a well-developed conscious mindand an under-utilized unconscious—that is, we have been trained (somemight say \"hypnotized\") to ignore or depreciate its processes. It's as ifwe have exercised and developed a powerful right arm while allowingthe left arm to wither. Too often, a person finds a therapist who designsan \"exercise program\" to further develop the \"right arm\" while hopingthat osmosis will take care of the left one.If, as many brain researchers claim, we use only 10% of our brainconsciously, and the other 90% unconsciously, then it might be helpful topicture a pyramid. If you step back and look, you will see that a pyramidhas a broad base and tapers to a narrow top. It is well-constructed towithstand stress and time. If you will picture the same pyramid upsidedown, you will see a structure that will have a hard time standing up. Itwould no doubt fall from its own weight. If you could then \"see\" thatmany people seem to use their minds as if they were upside down pyra-mids, then you can easily get hold of the why they topple so easily.However, let me again remind you, that I said that what you would bereading is a lie. So, too, may be that last sentence."},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"Utilizing Utilization135XIVUtilizing UtilizationHYPNOSIS: MAGIC WORKSIn an earlier chapter, I made the statement that being a goodhypnotist meant utilizing certain tools and skills that helped to direct theindividual toward their own resources...and then...get the hell out oftheir way! My experience has been, however, that most hypnotistsconsistently get in the individual's way and prevent the hypnotic state.Therapists, in their attempt to learn the \"right\" way of inducing thehypnotic state, go from one hypnosis seminar to another, and from onemagic book to another, in order to get \"THE MAGIC WORDS\" that willmake people go into a hypnotic state. They write \"THE MAGICWORDS\" down, memorize them, and attempt to hypnotize everyonewith those words. When their patients/clients \"refuse\" to cooperate, thesetherapists get discouraged and either give up using hypnosis, or buy more\"MAGIC BOOKS\" and attend more seminars to find \"THE REALMAGIC WORDS.\" In short, these \"hypnotists\" are attempting to bendthe patient/client to fit the mold, instead of designing the molds that willfit the patient/client.In my opinion, producing the hypnotic state is easier than falling offthe proverbial log, and much less painful. Not only does each individualalready \"know\" how to go into hypnosis, they probably experience thatstate several times each day. The hypnotic state itself, as well as hypnoticphenomena, are no more, and no less, than normal occurrences andbehaviors isolated, exaggerated and \"spotlighted.\" At my trainingseminars (Clinical Hypnosis: Innovative Techniques®), I have oftenobserved individuals \"escaping\" into their own hypnotic state to avoidthe state that the \"trainee hypnotist\" is attempting to produce. The trainee134is so busy doing it his way, that he fails to notice that his subject (victim)has \"escaped.\" I hope, in this chapter, to share with you the attitude andskills that will enable you to achieve \"that state\" with more individualsmore easily.Every individual carries with him a set of learned skills, responses,attitudes and belief systems, as well as a preferred \"system\" (Visual—Kinesthetic—Auditory). To me, it makes far more sense to utilize thesefactors rather than trying to force the individual into respondingaccording to your belief systems, responses, etc. By learning to utilizewhat the individual already knows, you will be starting from a solidfoundation instead of from a morass of quicksand.For the purpose of clarification, I would like to give a brief example.I would like you to focus on \"systems\" (Visual—Kinesthetic—Auditory)for a few moments. As a rule, hypnotists who are highly visual will tendto use visual induction methods—that is, they attempt to produce thehypnotic state via visual imagery. Those hypnotists who are highlykinesthetic will tend to rely on kinesthetic inductions; i.e., you're gettingheavier and heavier, etc. Auditory hypnotists will tend to rely on\"sounds\" as an induction method. If the individual you are working withhappens to match your system, you have a very good chance of beingsuccessful. If that individual doesn't \"match,\" you can always label thelack of results as \"resistance.\"VISUAL INDUCTIONDuring one training seminar, the \"hypnotist\" was telling the\"subject\" to \"feel the weight of your body, and your legs, as everythinggets heavier and heavier, and you are getting more and more deeplyrelaxed.\" It sounded great—only the \"subject\" was not responding. The\"hypnotist\" said to me, \"She is fighting me. Would you tell her tocooperate?\" I asked her (the subject) what she thought was wrong. Shereplied, \"I can't seem to get it. If he would show me what he means, I'llcooperate!\" I asked her if she had ever gone to the beach as a child andhad her legs buried in the sand. Her eyes went up left, she smiled, andlooked back at me and said, \"Sure.\" I then asked her to look across theroom and see herself at the beach as a little girl. After a moment shenodded and continued to \"look across the room.\" I then asked her to \"seethat little girl having her legs buried in that nice warm sand.\" She beganstaring intently and then slowly nodded her head. I said, \"Good."},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"136Monsters & Magical SticksNow...as you see yourself floating into that picture, you can continue toremember these feelings, and then close your eyes and enjoy all of it.\"Within a second her eyes closed, her breathing rate slowed, and shestayed like that for several minutes. When she opened her eyes she said,\"That was great! I could even smell the beach and I seem to be muchmore relaxed.\"In the above example, the woman went from \"resistance\" toresponding by simply allowing her to use her system (V) instead ofattempting to make her use the \"hypnotist's\" system (K). Now, don'tjump to conclusions. This example is only the tip of a very interestingiceberg. While matching systems is an important part of utilization, it isonly a small part. As you continue now to read and learn, I know that youwill soon discover how to utilize any and all parts of the individual'sbehavior to achieve the desired destination. It is my intention to citeseveral examples of how I have utilized utilization, and to give a briefexplanation.EXAMPLE I:A 27-year-old woman said she had been to several hypnotists, butthey couldn't hypnotize her. I asked her what she thought was preventingher from entering into hypnosis. She explained that they had all asked herto relax, but that she was always uptight (which was evidenced by hergeneral body posture, as well as almost constant jaw clenching). She saidthat the more she tried to relax, the more uptight and upset she wouldbecome. When she finished her explanation, I smiled, shook my head,and said \"Hey, if you knew how to relax that easily, you probablywouldn't be going to see a hypnotist.\" She laughed and replied, \"You'reright! I hadn't thought of it that way.\"I then asked her to close her eyes, concentrate on her tension and toreally feel all of it. After a short time she was instructed to really feel thetension in her arms and shoulders and, for the moment, forget the otherareas, and to nod when she had done so. Within several seconds shenodded, and I said, \"Now, I would like you to allow that creative part ofyou to give you a clear picture of what those tense muscles look like. Iknow that sounds strange, but that part of you can surprise you soon.\"When she nodded after about one minute, I asked her to keep her eyesclosed while she described the picture she was seeing. (At this point,there was a noticeable reduction of her jaw clenching, and her breathingrate had slowed and deepened.)Utilizing Utilization137She described the tense muscles as looking \"like pink and red thickrope with big knots every few inches.\" I told her that she was doinggreat, and then asked her to allow that part of her that remembers thefeelings of relaxation to give her a clear picture of what \"those\" relaxedmuscles would look like. After a short time she said, \"They look like bigpink spaghetti, only the pink is a softer color than before.\" She was thenasked to repeat the procedure, next with her legs—forgetting the arms—then her stomach area—forgetting the other areas—and to do it all in herown mind without talking. As she carried out her instructions, herbreathing rate continued to slow, and she began to evidence a degree ofphysical relaxation. After nearly 20 minutes, she opened her eyes(slowly, and with some effort) and said, \"That was interesting. Whatnext?\" I pointed out that our time was up, which thoroughly surprisedher.When she arrived for her next appointment, she was smiling, whichwas a considerable change from her first arrival. She told me that she\"thought\" that she had been less tense during the past week, and that herhusband said that she had seemed calmer. While she wasn't sure if shehad been less tense, she was sure that she was sleeping much better. (Shealso evidenced a substantial reduction in her general jaw-clenchingbehavior.) I asked her to close her eyes so that we could continue withwhat we had started. As soon as she closed her eyes, there was an almostinstant slowing of her breathing. I instructed her to pick out one area oftension, to concentrate on feeling all of it, to get a picture of that area,and to see if the picture had changed.After several minutes, she opened her eyes and said, \"Well, it's stillropes with knots, but the knots look looser.\" \"Like you've been feeling,\"I replied. I asked her to close her eyes again, and to get the picture of theknotted rope, and to signal by raising her left hand a few inches for\"yes,\" which she did. I then said, \"You have learned to get a picture fromyour feelings. Now, I would like you to continue your 'learnings' bygetting a feeling from a picture. Ask that part of you that remembers howto relax...NOW...to give you a clear picture of your relaxed muscles.When you've accomplished that, you know how to signal 'yes.'\"When she signaled (raised her left hand a few inches) I said, \"Nowkeep on watching while that part continues to help you get that relaxedfeeling, and that part will signal 'yes' when she's ready. You may besurprised that when you signal 'yes,' that hand [at this point I brush herleft hand lightly] will be so relaxed that it may want to float up toward"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"138Monsters & Magical Sticksyour face. I must confess that I have no idea just where that hand willcome to rest against your face. I will have to rely on that creative part ofyou to decide for both of us.\" Within a few minutes, not only did shelook as if she was \"in that state,\" but in addition, her left had begun aslow ascent to her face.EXAMPLE I: DISCUSSIONThis woman presented one very well-developed skill—that of beingtense. There are those who might argue that tension is not a skill. Onreflection, I know that they will recognize that tension, under theappropriate circumstances, would be an appropriate response. Thisindividual, however, had lost her ability to have choice as to when to usethis skill. Rather than attempt to make her conform to my blueprint, Idecided to use hers. When I made the statement, \"Hey, if you knew howto relax that easily, etc.\" I was signaling acceptance of her blueprint,being on her side, and establishing rapport all at the same time. Herresponse indicated that this had been successful.By asking her to feel the tension, I was utilizing what she wasalready an expert at, thereby insuring that she would be successful, andbeginning the processes of indirect suggestion. By directing her as towhich area to \"feel\" first, I was helping her to further accept my direc-tion. Having her \"see\" what the tense muscles looked like was, in fact,the first step in helping her to disassociate: Tension = Kinesthetic -Changing Kinesthetic to Visual = disconnecting or disassociating fromthe feeling (tension). Asking her to allow \"that part\" that \"remembers\"the feelings of relaxation, etc., was a series of unconscious communica-tions (suggestions): 1) There was another part of her than the one she wasused to; 2) That somewhere in time she had been relaxed; 3) She couldremember that feeling.When I asked her to close her eyes at the beginning of the secondsession, she immediately altered her rate of breathing, which indicatedthat she had \"made the connection\" and was learning to relax. By askingher to signal by raising her left hand slowly for \"yes,\" I was setting upideomotor response, and structuring the beginning of a possible handlevitation. (Stroking her hand lightly equals kinesthetic reinforcement ofthe verbal suggestion.) Since she had evidenced her ability to generatevisual experiences from kinesthetic experiences, helping her to generatekinesthetic experiences from visual experiences was simply utilizingwhat she \"knew\" how to do, but redirecting it. By utilizing her \"skills,\"Utilizing Utilization139\"beliefs\" and \"systems\" (Visual—Kinesthetic—Auditory), she not onlyachieved what she had been unable to achieve before (the hypnotic state),she also gained the ability to \"picture\" away her tension. As a result, herjaw clenching \"got lost\" and she became a much calmer individual ingeneral.EXAMPLE 2:During one of the Clinical Hypnosis: Innovative Techniques® train-ing seminars, I had asked the participants to practice a mirror/feedbackinduction. This induction method requires the \"hypnotist\" to copy thephysical position and gestures of the \"subject\" and to verbally feed backto the subject what the subject is doing. Next, the \"hypnotist\" begins toslowly lead the \"subject\" to the desired state. As I observed the practicesession, I noticed something interesting happening within one group. The\"hypnotist\" and the \"subject\" were in perfect synchronization, and eachwas staring intently at the other. I walked over to the group and heard the\"hypnotist\" saying \"and now you can close your eyes.\" The \"subject\"kept staring without blinking, her breathing was very deep and she wastotally still. After a few moments, the \"hypnotist\" said, \"Well, wheneveryou want to you can close your eyes.\" The \"subject\" continued staring.Since they were mirroring each other so well, and since the \"subject\" was\"locked on\" to the \"hypnotist,\" I could assume that he had done a goodjob of setting the stage. Yet, the \"subject\" would not respond to the\"hypnotist's\" suggestion of closing her eyes.I positioned myself so that I was within the subject's field of vision.(I was standing while the practice group were all seated.) After a fewmoments, I moved my right hand up slowly, starting at my waist andending at my cheek. As my hand moved up, the subject's eyes shiftedand followed my hand as it moved up. When her eyes met mine, Inodded twice, very slowly. As she continued to stare at me, I very slowlyblinked twice, nodded twice again, and then closed my eyes for three orfour seconds. When I opened my eyes, the subject closed hers, and I said,\"That's right! Now take all the time you need to see yourself at somepleasant place, while you continue to more deeply relax. Then gowherever you need to discover some skill or problem-solving ability thatwill be useful in your life... Now! When that creative part of youunderstands how to use those skills in your present and future situations,it will be time to return here. Be sure to bring all those good feelingsback to now with you.\""},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"140Monsters & Magical SticksUtilizing Utilization141When the subject had first shifted her eyes to mine, the \"hypnotist\"looked quickly at me, then back at the subject. After I had given theverbal suggestions to the subject, I said to the hypnotist, \"Since you havebeen watching and following her so carefully, you already know what todo.\" With that, I placed my fingers gently on his eyelids. His eyes closed,his body relaxed, and I said, \"You heard what I asked her to do, and nowyou can do the exact same thing differently...in your own way.\" Afternearly ten minutes, the man opened his eyes, and a few seconds later thewoman opened hers. They looked at each other and both began to giggle.(You might say that they were continuing to mirror each other.)EXAMPLE 2: DISCUSSIONWhile there was no way I could know what the woman's (subject's)general favored system was, I could see that she was staring withoutblinking. That indicated that, at that moment, she was into her visualsystem. Since they (subject and hypnotist) were matching each other, Icould also assume that the man had done an excellent job of leading herto an altered state of some kind, but that he was now \"in her way.\" Hewas in her way by giving her verbal instructions to do one thing (closeher eyes) while he was \"showing\" her something else (he was staring).Since she was, at that point, into a totally visual (altered) state, she was,in fact, responding.. .to what she was seeing. By directing her to my eyes,I could then \"show\" her what was expected. To restate the above in termsof utilization, I utilized her state (visual) and used her state to lead her tothe state I desired. As for the \"hypnotist,\" the same utilization applied.Since he had been staring and matching and responding to her, when sheclosed her eyes, he was ready to follow. I merely gave him a \"nudge.\"ADDITIONAL COMMENTMany people who engage in the practice of hypnosis, and almost allbeginning hypnotists, have been hypnotized into believing that thehypnotic state requires eye closure. That is not the case! Most people,and perhaps all people, can enter into or be in a hypnotic state with theireyes wide open. There are some experts in the field of hypnosis whocontend that eye closure simply makes the subject's tasks (whatever theymay be) easier to accomplish. While I would agree in general, there areexceptions to that \"rule.\"I have worked with many people who respond better with their eyesopen. In some cases, eye closure actually stops the individual fromprocessing and responding. I believe that most hypnotists require eyeclosure for their comfort. I have observed dozens of hypnotists become\"unglued\" as a result of a subject staring at them. All the signs of asatisfactory hypnotic state may be present, yet the hypnotist interrupts thesubject's state because \"being watched\" disturbs them. I hope you willlearn to accept the subject's right to enter hypnosis with open eyes, andto utilize that situation as just another choice.EXAMPLE 3:While giving a lecture/demonstration at a local university for a groupof dentists and their assistants, the following occurred: One dentist stoodup and said, \"While I try to use some hypnosis in my practice, I can't behypnotized myself. I think my patients sense my failure and as a resultI'm not very successful with hypnosis.\" I inquired as to what wouldtranspire when he was the \"subject.\" He said that he could feel himselffighting it, and that he would just tense up. He also stated that he didn'tlike anyone trying to control him. When we later moved from the lecturearea into the dental clinic section, he asked me if I would \"try\" tohypnotize him. I asked him what hypnotic phenomena he would need toexperience in order to be satisfied. He replied, \"Anesthesia in some partof my body.\"I asked him to take a seat in a dental chair, which he did. I picked upa white towel, put it into his left hand and said, \"OK, I'm going to helpyou to experience hypnosis, but first I want to test out your so-called'control.'\" I began by positioning his left arm straight out to the side ofhis body, horizontal to the floor. I said to him, \"Now, your job is to holdthat towel as tightly as you can. When you don't expect it, I'm going topull it away from you. I may walk behind you and then sneak up, or Imay just grab it from you.\" His arm stiffened and he had a \"death grip\"on the towel as he said, \"No you won't!\" At this point I made severalmoves as if to try and grab the towel. As I did so, his intenseconcentration on the towel and me increased. After a few more\"attempts,\" I stepped behind him and said, \"Get ready, I'm going to standwhere you can't see me and when you least expect it, I'm going to jumpout and get it.\"At this point his left arm had been cataleptic for several minutes. Toan observer trained in hypnotic phenomena, it would have been apparentthat he was in \"that state.\" However, he had not yet experienced his\"proof.\" I reached over toward his left hand, slowly with my left hand."},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"142Monsters & Magical SticksAt the same time, I reached toward his right arm with my right hand andrested it gently on his right forearm. I then slowly lifted his right arm up,off the arm of the chair. I held his arm up, very still, for several seconds,and then I let go. His right arm remained up, without moving, and hecontinued to stare at the towel in his left hand.I had planned on going no further, but the group instructor had adifferent goal in mind. Without my knowledge, he had taken a sterileneedle from a drawer. While I was continuing to make gestures at thetowel \"as if\" I was going to grab it, the instructor inserted the needle inthe subject's right hand. This was done in the fleshy part, between thethumb and first finger. (When I saw what he had done, I was so surprisedthat I think I went into \"that state\" myself.) The subject didn't move amuscle, nor acknowledge what had happened. He gave every indicationof being totally unaware of \"his condition.\" We, the attendees andinstructors, all stood observing the subject while he continued to stare atthe towel, without movement or comment.After three or four minutes, he looked up and said, \"Well, nothing ishappening. When are you going to begin?\" Everyone began laughing atthat statement, and he said, \"What the hell is so funny?\" He then beganlooking around at the group. He suddenly spotted the needle in his handand exclaimed, \"When the hell did that happen? I didn't even feel it!\"EXAMPLE 3: DISCUSSIONBy his initial comments, the subject had indicated that not only wascontrol a major issue for him, but that he was proud of his \"control.\"Utilization simply required giving him something to control—thetowel—and then \"helping\" him to worry about his control (my threat totake the towel away). As has already been stated, people often enter theirown hypnotic state to avoid someone else's. Based on that, I could besure he would enter into hypnosis to avoid my \"control.\" It was also agood bet that, as long as I didn't point that fact out to him, he wouldcooperate by \"controlling\" everything. As for his developingspontaneous analgesia, that is not an uncommon occurrence: that is,many individuals spontaneously develop partial or complete analgesiawhen entering a hypnotic state. (Erickson, M. and Rossi, E., 1979;Kroeger, 1963).Utilizing Utilization143EXAMPLE 4:I was asked to give a lecture/demonstration on the subject ofutilization as a method of hypnotic induction. During a question andanswer period, I was asked to give an example of utilization with thetype of individual who fears \"loss of control.\" I began to tell the groupabout the incident cited in Example 3 above. As I explained what hadhappened, I held my right arm out from my side, horizontally to thefloor, as if I was holding the towel. I was, in effect, \"showing\" the groupwhat had transpired.As I continued, I noticed something interesting happening to a manin the front row. He was staring intently at my right hand, withoutblinking and without body movement. I continued to explain what hadhappened, and at the same time, I walked down off the stage, keeping myright arm fixed in its position. I walked slowly toward the man and saidto him, \"And what color is the towel you...SEE NOW.\" He replied,\"White... It's a white dish towel.\" I said, \"That's right! Now...I wantyou to hold it for me.\" With that he reached out and I put the \"towel\" intohis left hand. I then gently extended his left arm straight out in front ofhis body. I then said, \"As you close your eyes, I want you to continue tosee the towel [his eyes closed], and then continue to go where youneed...NOW...to go to remember something pleasant and useful toyou...NOW.\"The man's arm stayed cataleptic, and he sat, eyes closed, withoutmovement, for almost ten minutes. During this period of time, Icontinued with my explanation as to what had happened at the dentalmeeting (example 3 above). The man slowly opened his eyes, loweredhis arm and said, \"You hypnotized me! I can't believe it, but I know ithappened.\"After the meeting was over, the man approached me. He asked if hecould make an appointment to see me at my office. Before I couldrespond, a very elderly gentleman interrupted, and said, \"If I hadn't beenhere to see it, I wouldn't believe it! Joe [not his real name] has been todozens of hypnotists over the last ten years, and no one has been able tohypnotize him!\" \"You're kidding,\" I replied. \"I didn't have to doanything. He did it to himself. Maybe if I had known how impossible hewas, I could have failed, too.\"Joe then ticked off an impressive list of well-known hypnotists whohad \"failed\" with him. I replied, \"Do you mean to say that you have beensuccessful at failing to go where they wanted you to go, and instead"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"144Monsters & Magical Sticksyou've gone where you wanted?\" He nodded his head vigorously andsaid, \"Yes... I mean no... Well, I guess so.\" I smiled and said, \"Youmust be an Indian Scout, are you not?\" He stared at me and said, \"What'sthat supposed to mean?\" I replied, \"You seem very proud of all thescalps you've collected!\"EXAMPLE 4: DISCUSSIONI can only make some educated guesses as to why so many fine,well-known hypnotists had \"failed\" with Joe. In the first place, I don'tthink that they did fail. Joe was a \"natural\" hypnotic subject. However,he was also the type of individual who has set ideas as to how everythingshould be done. (This was later proved to be the case when we met at myoffice.) Therefore, it was a good bet that Joe would enter into hypnosis inhis own unique way, and that he would resent direct orders orsuggestions.Secondly, Joe was what I term a \"visual's visual\"—that is, hehallucinates beautifully with his eyes wide open. In effect, he staresstraight ahead and makes \"movies.\" Since most traditional hypnoticinductions attempt to \"cause\" or \"force\" eye closure, Joe would probablyrespond by staring straight ahead. Once Joe was helped to make a\"movie,\" he almost automatically went into the hypnotic state. Duringthe lecture, Joe \"saw\" the towel and made his personal \"movie\" about it.By asking what color the towel was, I was, in effect, accepting his way ofresponding instead of trying to get him to do it my way. By asking him tohold the towel, I was taking his \"movie\" and redirecting it toward a goal.In this case, the goal was to produce a formal altered state. Since hevisualized so well, it was a good bet that he would more or less\"disconnect\" from his kinesthetic experiences. Therefore, he wouldn'tknow where I put his arm, which made it easy to produce catalepsy.EXAMPLE 5:This example is really a consolidation of several individuals whocome under the heading of \"oppositional\" or \"paradoxical.\" Individualsin this category not only tend to do and respond exactly opposite of whatyou intend, but they often tend to drive therapists in general \"A LITTLECRAZY!\"The patient's complaints included not getting along with people ingeneral, and anger at being told what to do. The patient had \"tried\" to behypnotized, but would not \"allow myself to respond.\"Utilizing Utilization145ME: I believe that your skill of deciding for yourself is useful.

Using thepatient's oppositional nature, I structured a double bind (or maybeseveral): The patient could cooperate by not doing what I asked, orcooperate by doing what I asked. It didn't matter which method he chose.My experience has been that, after two or three sessions of the abovecraziness, the patient stops being oppositional in therapy. Moreimportantly, they stop being oppositional in the real world.EXAMPLE 6:The following occurred during an in-house training seminar formedical doctors at a local hospital. After demonstrating several rapidinduction methods and utilization techniques, I asked the group topractice with each other. While most of the group was doing that, oneyoung doctor approached me and said, \"I'd really like to be able toexperience hypnosis, but for me it's impossible.\" I asked him if he wouldUtilizing Utilization147allow me to use him as a subject when the group had finished theirpractice. He agreed to do so. When the group had finished their practicesession, I asked Dr. \"S\" to come up and take a seat. I then explained tothe group that Dr. \"S\" believed that it was impossible for him to go intothe hypnotic state; that since that was what he believed, I must acceptthat as true for him. I then pointed out that as doctors, they did not haveto undergo surgery to learn to perform surgery, nor did they have to get adisease in order to diagnose it. I turned to Dr. \"S\" and said, \"Would youagree with what I just said?\" He nodded his head and said, \"Yes, thatmakes sense.\"ME: Now, you are here to learn something about hypnosis, and soare your colleagues, is that correct? [His head nods \"yes.\"]Since you don't need to have surgery to learn to performsurgery, it stands to reason that you don't have to be hypnotizedto learn how to produce the hypnotic state.\"S\": Yes, that makes sense also.ME: Good, we agree. Now I'm going to ask you to simply pretendthat you are a great hypnotic subject. That will allow yourcolleagues to learn a great deal, and of course, so will you. Isthat OK?\"S\": [Dr. \"S\" nods his head] Sure, I'd like to be of some help.ME: Now, pretending that you're a good subject, what would yourbody position be if you were in hypnosis?\"S\": I guess relaxed and loose.ME: Relaxed and loose .. .good .. .can you show me what that wouldlook like?\"S\": [Rearranges his body position into what looks like a relaxedposition.]ME: How would your head be .. .straight up like it is now, or kind ofdown toward your chest?\"S\": I guess it would be down a little.. .like this [lowers his head].ME: Eyes opened or closed... NOW?"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"148Monsters & Magical Sticks\"S\": Closed, [closes his eyes]ME: Good! Now pretending that you are going into a deep hypnoticstate, I would like you to experience, within yourself, what youwould experience. Later you can tell us about it.\"S\": [Nods head slowly, breathing begins to noticeably slow]ME: [Supposedly to the audience, but really directed toward Dr. \"S\"]Now, if he were really in hypnosis, I would ask him to take histime in discovering...NOW...where he learned to believe thathe had to hold onto certain limitations, and to discover from hiscreative self what he needs to have at least three new choices[Pause for 3 or 4 minutes.] I would also ask him to continue tolearn and ignore us, and to not return here until his unconsciousmind was satisfied as to his new choices.At this point in time, Dr. \"S\" appears to be \"long gone\" and isevidencing all the classical manifestations of trance: slow, deepbreathing; immobility; total physical relaxation; and no responses to thenoises or questions from the audience. Dr. \"S\" continued to \"pretend\" tobe in hypnosis while I held a question and answer session. This went onfor ten minutes while we all watched Dr. \"S.\"I then said, \"He can continue as long as he wants and as long as isnecessary, or whichever comes first.\" I spent another 15 minutesanswering questions, and then the meeting was adjourned. There was justone small problem. Dr. \"S\" was continuing to \"pretend\" that he was inthat state. Several of the doctors came up and began to watch Dr. \"S\"while he sat \"pretending.\" One of the doctors said, \"When will he comeout of it?\" I replied, \"Normally, you would let him continue as deeplyand as long as he needs to continue. However, since everyone is waitingto leave, you could say to him that he can continue learning after hereturns here, and he will return here when he realizes now how full hisbladder is.\" Within two minutes, Dr. \"S\" began moving in the chair, andthen his eyes opened. He said, \"What happened? Where is everyone?I've got to go to the bathroom in the worst way.\"EXAMPLE 6: DISCUSSIONSince Dr. \"S\" had signed up for the program, he was, in all probabil-ity, there to learn. On the other hand, he \"believed\" that being hypnotizedUtilizing Utilization149was impossible for him. The task, therefore, was to find a way to utilizethose two factors in some manner that was acceptable to him. \"Accept-ing\" that his being hypnotized was impossible, by stating that to thegroup, utilized that aspect. Emphasizing the learning aspects of the meet-ing, and then asking him to \"pretend\" for the purpose of learning, utilizedthat part. By structuring the situation so he could merely \"pretend,\"allowed him to believe it was still \"impossible\" and yet he could stilllearn by simulation. Of course, if you pretend to raise your right hand,you will, in most cases, actually raise it.EXAMPLE 6: COMMENTS AND FOLLOW-UPAsking a subject or patient to pretend is, in itself, a powerfulutilization technique. Pretending elicits memories of those aspectsnecessary to \"pretend.\" I have asked individuals to pretend that theyknow what it would take to solve some specific problem, or to overcomea fear, etc. In the vast majority of cases, their pretended answers areimportant keys that unlock the right doors. In addition, the \"pretend\"approach is a powerful induction technique. When a subject tells youwhat he would experience if he were \"really\" in hypnosis, he has, in mostcases, given you the exact map to follow. Last, but not least, Dr. \"S,\" as aresult of his \"pretend\" hypnotic experiences, began to experiencechanges in some important areas of his life.Several weeks after his experience, he took me to lunch. He told methat he and his wife had been having some difficulties, and that he hadnot been able to \"get it on\" sexually with his wife in almost a year. Hiswife had been claiming that he was almost always uptight, and that heseldom \"let go.\" He said that since the training class, he had begun toloosen up, and was finding it easier to \"let things happen,\" and that hewas becoming sexually active with his wife. In addition, he informed methat for one week following the class, he had a tendency to \"sort of driftaway and lose track of everything, whenever I'm alone with nothingimportant to do.\" I told him that he was an excellent hypnotherapist, andthat his ability to not understand was helping him to gain understanding.EXAMPLE 7:\"B,\" a 38-year-old doctor, was referred to me with a \"list\" ofpresenting problems. He had made out the list very carefully. Heinformed me that his list was in the order of the problems' importance.\"B\" told me that he had taken several courses in \"professional\" hypnosis"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"150Monsters & Magical Sticks(I assume that other courses were to him \"unprofessional\" courses), andthat he attended many hypnosis workshops. He also stated that he oftenused self-hypnosis, but had been unable to solve his problems with thatapproach. Additionally, \"B\" had been in psychotherapy for nearly a year,and he claimed that he had made little or no progress. I asked him whyhe continued for a year when it wasn't, according to him, doing muchgood. He replied, \"I like to finish what I start, and I'm a very patientman.\" When asked what he did for relaxation, he answered, \"When Iwant to relax, I more or less drop out. I accomplish that by turning onsome music at a very low volume. I then close my eyes and really makemyself tune in to the music. I then start a process of drifting.\" (I wonderif you, the reader, have figured out what his preferred conscious systemis?)After gathering some additional information, I began to tell himseveral metaphors. The thrust of these metaphors was to \"remind\" himthat we do many things without thinking about them in specific, step-by-step detail. I wanted him to remember that there are many areas in whichwe rely on our unconscious processes; that this frees our \"logical\" mindfor other matters. (I'm sure that the reader can \"see\" that \"B\" was a verylogical person: problems in a list, systematically studying hypnosis, etc.You can.. .NOW RECOGNIZE.. .that his preferred system is auditory.)As I would tell him a metaphor, I would lean slightly to my right,and talk softly in a monotone (remember the music). When giving himso-called \"factual, logical\" information, I would lean to my left, and talkmore rapidly and with tonal animation. After a short time, when I wouldlean right and switch to a monotone, \"B\" would sit perfectly still andstare intently. When I leaned to my left, he would \"fidget\" and his facewas animated. Toward the end of our first session, \"B\" said, \"I knowyou're doing something to me. I can feel it happening, but I can't figureit out. Aren't you going to try and hypnotize me?\" I laughed and said,\"I'm still trying to figure out how to get you to stop going into hypnosisso well!\"EXAMPLE 7: SESSION 2Our second meeting was basically a repetition of our first session.The metaphors were now more directed toward his \"list.\" Whenever Ifinished a metaphor, I would stare at him without blinking for severalseconds. I would then blink several times, switch to my left and give himsome \"logical\" information. As we neared the end of the session, heUtilizing Utilizationagain said, \"Aren't you going to try and hypnotize me?\" I again laughed,leaned to my right, and just stared at him. \"B\" immediately \"froze\" andstared back. I then sat straight up, and \"B\" blinked several times andsaid, \"Hey, have you been hypnotizing me all along?\" \"That would betelling,\" I replied, while I nodded my head slowly \"yes.\" \"Besides,there's no such thing as hypnosis.\"I then leaned to my right, and moved my lips as if I was speaking.However, I wasn't making a sound. \"B\" \"froze\" again, his eyes glazed,and his body began to slump. Very softly I said, \"Not yet. Next week willbe soon enough.\" I then sat straight up in my chair. \"B\" blinked severaltimes and then said, \"Wow. That was strange. I know you hypnotizedme, but I don't know how.\" With that we ended our second session.EXAMPLE 7: SESSION 3\"B\" entered my office and sat down with an expectant look on hisface. (You could say he was altering his state in preparation of having hisstate altered.) I asked him if anything surprising had occurred during thelast week. He replied, \"Yes, quite a bit. I have been laughing more and Iseem to be looser in the way I move. My staff has commented about howmuch calmer I seem to be. The only problem is, I can't figure out why.\"I responded by telling him, \"Good. You are a very logical person, butin the past you've been totally illogical in your attempts to solve yourproblems. After all, if logic were the answer, you would have logicallysolved the problems. Since logic has failed you, it's illogical to do moreof the same.\" (As I was giving him that logical, illogical explanation, Islowly shifted to my right and also shifted to monotone.)I reached for his left hand, and slowly and gently lifted it up. Whenhis hand and arm were about one foot off the arm of the chair, I held hishand still. I said to him (still in a monotone), \"Now you know whereyour hand is because you can see it. However, even though you're adoctor, you would have difficulty naming all the muscles, in the exactlogical order, that are...keeping your hand and arm exactly as it is.\"(Unconscious suggestion for arm catalepsy.) At this point, \"B\" wascompletely still, was staring without blinking, and was totally En-Tranced with what was transpiring.I continued: \"Now...as you close your eyes, you won't be able toknow where your hand is by seeing it. Instead, you can be verysuccessful by allowing yourself to experience all of the feelings of it.\"(Much of what is now being said is directed toward two goals: 1) trance"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"152Monsters & Magical Sticksinduction; and 2) metaphoric approach to his \"real\" problem—being shutoff as to experiencing feelings in general.) \"And, as you continue toconnect to all those good feelings, without action...and perhaps withoutunderstanding, then my voice will continue to be as if soft music, andyou can continue to drift.\"At this point, \"B\" was given some direction toward the resolution ofhis problems and then told, \"Your arm will probably remain stuck, just asyou have been, until you discover how to become even more flexible inyour personal life.\" Twenty minutes later, \"B's\" arm moved slowlydown. Instead of terminating his hypnotic state, he appeared to bedeepening it. I told him that his unconscious mind would decide if hewas ready to return to \"this time and place,\" or to continue with what hewas doing if that was more important. \"B\" stayed in \"that state\" foranother hour and fifteen minutes. I had to use one of our other offices tosee my next appointments.Over the next several weeks, the changes in \"B\" were not onlydramatic, but delightful to watch. He put it best when he said,\"Everything used to seem so serious and important, life or death. Now,I'm having some fun with my life, and saving my serious side for trulyserious problems. The funny thing is that I'm accomplishing more withless effort.\"EXAMPLE 7: DISCUSSIONThe above example is filled with utilization. Often the inductionprocesses and therapeutic goal processes were completely intertwined.That makes it somewhat difficult to make a clear delineation between thetwo. Certain factors, however, can be separated and spotlighted.\"B\" had been trained in traditional hypnotic techniques, and hadbeen practicing them on himself. However, \"it\" wasn't working.Therefore, any use of so-called traditional approaches would no doubtmeet the same fate. In other words, any overt attempt to hypnotize \"B\"would probably not succeed. He gave support to that interpretation when,at the end of the first session, he said, \"Aren't you going to try tohypnotize me.\" (In this context, the word \"try\" implies: I know it won'tbe successful, but let's try.)In addition, \"B\" had been in formal psychotherapy for almost a year,with little or no acknowledged results. Helping him to gain more\"insight\" or \"logical\" understanding would produce a lot more of thesame... NOTHING.Utilizing Utilization\"B\" had given me the information needed to help him experience analtered state. This information was conveyed when he explained whathappened when he listened to music on low volume. By leaning right andtalking in a slow monotone, I hoped to accomplish two things: Theleaning right would itself become an unconscious suggestion to enter intohypnosis; the monotone would recreate his experience of hearingsomething in the background while he \"drifted.\" His responses to thesetactics indicated that they would \"do the trick.\"He had also told me that he was a patient man. Telling him long,drawn-out metaphors would insure he would have plenty to be patientabout: Listening to me, trying to understand my point, waiting for me to\"try\" to hypnotize him, while drifting due to my monotone. Last, butperhaps most important: pointing out to him that he would have tofeel...his arm in order to remember where it was, required him to get intouch (or pay attention, or tune in) to his internal (kinesthetic) sensations,while, at the same time, he was attempting to listen to my monotonemetaphors. The combination of his \"patience,\" \"drifting when listeningto something soft and low,\" and my pseudo-logic all combined to utilizehis skills and experiences to help him move...NOW...to newexperiences.I could no doubt \"DO\" one hundred pages on utilization. I don'twant to use a sledge hammer to drive a thumb tack. While what you haveread about utilization was directed primarily toward producing thehypnotic state, utilization is even more useful as a therapeutic strategy. Itis beyond the scope and intent of this work to outline utilization in detailas a therapeutic approach. However, throughout this work, I haveattempted to \"sneak\" in examples of several utilization methods.CREATIVE UTILIZATIONFor those of you who wish to take a creative leap, the following hintsmay be useful for you to utilize: Utilize the compulsive personality'scompulsiveness to compulsively carry out assignments that lead to newbehaviors, which break up the compulsiveness; utilize the rigid person'sneed to be right, to have them carry out the assignment of being wrong,just right, and to enter into hypnosis in the \"right\" way; utilize thephobic's ability to generate feelings (Kinesthetic) from their internalpictures (Visual) to generate new feelings from new internal pictures;utilize the depressive's \"skill\" of holding on to feelings (depression) no"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"154Monsters & Magical Sticksmatter what any one says or does, to learn to hold on to good feelings inspite of the ups and downs of life.In summary, you can...BEGIN NOW...to look at the presentingproblems as a form of unique skill. Once you do that, your task is todiscover the method behind that skill, and then to redirect it. The grandmaster of this form of utilization was the incomparable Milton Erickson,M.D. He utilized his own physical limitations as hypnotic induction cues.He utilized the patient's personality, history, traits and problems astechniques for change. Many wise and well-versed individuals havewritten about the techniques of Dr. Erickson. These individuals all tendto have a different \"answer\" as to what his work was based on. Whateverthe truth may be, I believe that if you approach Dr. Erickson's worklooking for consistent utilization, you will be consistently rewarded,In some situations (I'm sure that Dr. Erickson would have agreed),you need not do anything to produce hypnosis via utilization. Severalyears ago, a friend of mine got married. He asked me to a small dinnerparty to meet his new wife. He told me she was excited about theprospect of meeting a \"real\" hypnotist. He informed me that she wasafraid that if she looked at my eyes she would get \"put under.\" When Iarrived for the dinner party, my friend greeted me at the door. He led mein to meet his wife. As he introduced me, she reached out to shake myhand, and then her eyes caught mine. She began to stare, andthen...BAM! Her eyes closed, she slumped and I had to reach out andcatch her. You could say that my presence, combined with her beliefsystem and expectations, produced an interesting phenomenon... Youcould say that she had hypnotized herself into being hypnotized by myeyes. But, of course, and lest we forget, there's no such thing as...XVWeighing AnchorsRED LIGHT DISTRICTIf you were driving down a busy uptown street, and suddenly a greenlight turned red, would you...stop now! It's probably safe for me toassume that you would, under most circumstances. If we were toexamine this simple act of stopping, we could then move forward into anew area together. We might discover some complex and interesting\"things.\" We might agree that the red light has become a simple symbolthat elicits a complex sequence of behavior which we would call\"stopping.\" Within the behavior called \"stopping\" are includedperceptual problem-solving skills, psycho-motor, neuro-motor activity—eye, hand, foot, etc.—coordination, driving skills and much more, allchained together as a complex sequence called \"stopping for a red light.\"The red light, through learning processes, has become whatbehaviorists term an \"external stimulus.\" Other theorists would call thered light an \"anchor\" or \"trigger\" (Bandler and Grinder). They wouldclaim, and I would agree, that the red light now anchors: that is, it hasassociated with it a whole series of behaviors through a more or lesscoded, sequential and repetitive manner. We might even say that theanchor (red light) is so strong that even if you are not the driver, certainaspects of the response are elicited anyway. (How many times have youjammed on the non-existent brake when you were the passenger and notthe driver?)ANCHORS: A SIMPLISTIC DEFINITIONAnchors can be most easily understood if we reduce them to a simplestimulus-response construct. But no one promised you that this book was155"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"156Monsters & Magical Sticksto be easy. Accepting the easy definition will help you to not learn thesubtleties of anchors. For those of you who want it easy, here goes:Anchors (triggers) = any stimulus that triggers a set of internal responsesand/or actions.However, you might want to consider everything within humanexperience is, in effect, an anchor, or, if you will, a red light that sets intomotion a chain of responses. Take the words you are now reading,comfortably deep or deeply comfortable. Each word is an anchor for anexperience of understanding. As you read each word, those symbols oranchors lead you to an unconscious process that includes, but is notlimited to, interpreting the word itself and attaching your personalexperience and understanding to it.For example, as you read the word \"house,\" what memories will thatevoke in you...NOW? Try an experiment, if you will. Get together withseveral friends, and give each one a paper and pencil (or pen or crayon).Say the word \"house,\" and ask each to write down in detail what s/he isreminded of. The diversity of triggered or anchored memories should bevery interesting, for someone.In most cases, the word \"cumquat\" will not evoke the same anchoredresponse as the word \"sex\" will now! Anchors, like all other experiences(which themselves are anchors), come in different intensities and aredifferent for each one of us. What turns me on may turn you off, and ifwhat turns you on turns me off...well... However, words are only oneform of anchors. Again, everything can be, and is, for someone at sometime an anchor. If, for our purposes, we were to understand anchors to beany trigger—internal or external—which evokes within someone acertain set response in all or most all cases, regardless of whether welabel the response good or bad, and when such response is ritualized, weshould have an anchor for the word anchor.ANCHORS IN POST-HYPNOTIC RESPONSEIf we were to get a little metaphysical, we might say that anchors area form of post-hypnotic suggestion. That is, that circumstances,situations, people, schools, smells, traumas, etc., have suggested certainresponses to all the anchors in our world. (Remember, if you've nowforgotten, there's no such thing as hypnosis.) Within the framework oftraditional hypnosis, the hypnotist might \"suggest\" that at a snap of thefingers, the subject will remember his/her 5th birthday. If this suggestionWeighing Anchors157were successful, we could say that the snap of the fingers had become theanchor to trigger the suggested memory.Now, I am going to upset some of you who might believe that theconcept of anchoring is new. Boy, have you been anchored if you believethat! If, for the moment, we leave aside natural anchors (whatever theyare), and limit this part of our discussion to anchors and hypnosis, wecould together learn something new. Modern old-time hypnotists werethe first to discover \"suggested\" internal anchors (unless specified to notbe the case, from now on we will discuss anchors as suggested inten-tional phenomena). Old-fashioned trance induction was and is a verylong, tedious procedure. The modern old-time hypnotist discovered whatare now called \"reinduction cues.\" Before the subject was \"counted out\"(or whatever) from hypnosis, the following type of suggestion would begiven: \"...when I touch your forehead [shoulder, what have you] andcount [backward, forward, up, down, it doesn't matter], you will re-enterinto this pleasant [deep, comfortable] state.\" (Kroeger, 1963; Wolberg,1964).Where this post-hypnotic suggestion \"took\" you would have, ineffect, a one-trial learning anchor. From that point on, each time thehypnotist triggered that anchor, the subject would re-enter the so-calledtrance state. In some cases, any other person triggering the anchor wouldfind the subject entering into a trance. Pavlov, with his development ofclassical stimulus-response conditioning, was one of the first to recognizeanchors and to realize that anything could be used as a stimulus toproduce a response. He discovered, in his work with dogs, that food—theunconditioned stimulus (US)—leads to an unconditioned response (UR):salivating. Pair a bell to the US, and in a short while, the bell becomes aconditioned stimulus that elicits the UR. Another way of describing thatcondition would be: The bell has become an anchor (trigger) that pro-duces the response of salivating, as if the bell were food.Andrew Salter (Conditioned Reflex Therapy, 1961) held that hypno-sis—that is, the state of hypnosis as separate from the method of produc-ing hypnosis—is, itself, a series of conditioned responses. He furtherconcluded that all symptoms, regardless of the labels, are a result ofconditioned inhibitions, and that all humans are born with the capacity tobe outgoing, spontaneous and fun-loving. (We might say born utilizingfully the right hemisphere, as well as the left.) Thus, we are conditionedin painful association (anchors) to be afraid of our natural state and"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"158Monsters & Magical Sticksinstead to become inhibited. (Perhaps to become too left-hemispheric;see Chapter X, \"Left Meets Right Meets Left.\")Whether Salter's theory is correct or not does not take away from theimplied conclusion: Individuals have the ability to associate unrelated (inreality) stimuli to produce complex responses. We might choose to callthe stimulus an \"anchor\" which produces a set of learned responses.Let's suppose little Johnnie is trying independence on for size. Hepulls himself up to his full (fill in average height of a five-year-old) andthus, towering under his father, he says, \"NO! I won't!\" Father becomesenraged and jumps to his feet pointing at Johnnie and yells, \"Don't yousay 'no' to me or I'll knock your block off. Get to your room.\" Severalyears later, Johnnie is sitting in a therapist's office claiming that he can'tsay \"no\" to anyone he sees as being in authority over him. If you were toconclude that, for Johnnie, saying the word \"no\" has become an anchorthat elicits great fear, then you are right.What you have read this far has anchored you into an understanding.In my clinical practice, I have heard people claim that certain facialexpressions, tones of voice, gestures, postures, words, smells, etc. havecaused them to: get depressed, get anxious, throw up, get headaches, gocrazy, etc., etc. You could consider all of the above conditioned reflexresponses or anchors.You've probably remembered by now that Pavlov conditioned a dogto salivate at the sound of a bell. Wrong! The dog conditioned a bunch ofscientists to ring a bell whenever the dog salivated. Be careful to deter-mine now who is anchoring whom.ERICKSON AND ANCHORSMilton Erickson discovered some very powerful uses for anchorswhich have influenced several individuals, including myself, in our inter-est, understanding and uses of anchors. Erickson observed that if heasked a patient to sit just as he had the last time he experienced trance,and Erickson began talking in the same manner and/or about the samesubject as the last trance experience, the patient would re-enter the trancestate without any so-called induction. Erickson named this technique\"recapitulation.\"A colleague of mine, David Dobson, and I became fascinated withthis phenomenon, and began experimenting with it. In our experiments(separately and then comparing notes), we discovered (or stumbled upon)a very interesting additional phenomenon: If you could get a subject toWeighing Anchors159remember a specific situation in his imagination, he would often manifestall the emotional responses that the subject associated with the actualincident as if he were actually there.In one instance, a woman complained that when her husband touchedher in a sexual way, she became \"sick to my stomach. I feel like throw-ing up.\" I asked her to close her eyes and remember being with her hus-band, hearing his voice, smelling his after-shave, feeling his touch. Atthis point, she opened her eyes and began gagging. This was anotherform of recapitulation without a formal trance or regression and yet...Dr. Dobson and I both concurred that the individuals were enteringtrance and regressing spontaneously whenever they were asked to\"imagine a situation\" and all their systems were involved (Kinesthetic,Visual, Auditory, and in some cases, Gustatory and Olfactory). Ourexperiments and observations led us to conclude that individuals weresuffering the pain they suffered as a result of more or less powerfulanchors which acted as if they were hypnotic suggestions, and producedpowerful, repetitive conditional responses—just as a red light triggers acomplex series of actions leading to stopping.SPONTANEOUS ANCHORSMany years ago, a serendipitous event brought out the ease withwhich people are anchored, the importance of anchors, and how anchorscould not only be anything, but could produce responses entirely unre-lated to the anchor itself. I had put a man into hypnosis while he was sit-ting in my office recliner (actually he put himself there), and asked himto go back to the source of a particular problem he was having. All hellbroke loose. He cried, moaned, twisted around, and more. When I askedhim to signal if he wanted to end this trance, he signaled \"no.\" He carriedon this way for about 20 minutes, and then terminated his hypnotic state,claiming he had learned a great deal. He returned the following week forhis next appointment, and I greeted him in the reception area. He lookedrelaxed and was smiling, and said he had had a great week with substan-tial reduction of his symptoms (one of which was asthma).We walked into my office, and he sat down in the recliner...BANG!... the picture of Dorian Gray. His smile slipped away, his tonechanged, he began to wheeze, cry, moan, etc. I asked him what waswrong. He said he didn't know, and I was very puzzled by his response.Then I noticed his eyes were dilated and he appeared to be \"out of it\" orin \"that state.\" I took his hand and pulled him out of the recliner, and said"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"16oMonsters & Magical Stickssharply, \"Look at me now and recall a time you were happy aboutsomething you just did.\" Slowly, his breathing changed, his face relaxedthe wheezing stopped, and he began to smile. I asked him to sit in an-other chair, which he did without any problem. After obtaining hispermission for him to \"experience\" something, I asked him to again sit inthe recliner. As he approached it, his body, posture and facial expressionbegan to change, and as he sat down, all the previous behavior began tore-emerge. He jumped out of the chair and said he wasn't going to sitthere \"cause the chair is doing something to me.\" He was right. The chairhad become an anchor, or post-hypnotic re-induction, that led him to re-experience his last painful time in that chair, with all the attendant mem-ory and emotional response which he now blamed the chair for.PAVLOV AND ANCHORSThe above incident made several things clear to me. The chair hadbecome a conditioned stimulus—like Pavlov's bell—in one trial; and aperson could spend years in therapy trying to find out why they had aphobia about a chair. If a chair could become such a powerful anchor, sotoo could a word, a tone, a touch—or whatever. The anchor need nothave any logical relationship to the response the anchor produces. (Justrecently, I \"helped\" an individual to develop a mini-phobic response to atelephone, and then used the same telephone to elicit memories andresponses relating to the first time he had fallen in love.)This incident also caused a regression (in me) to a time three yearsearlier. A professor of neurological psychology and I had a \"little\"disagreement during a lecture he was giving on classical conditioningand neurological responses. I asked him a theoretical question: \"If anindividual could be conditioned to respond in a certain way to a givenstimulus, could you use the same stimulus and/or response to trigger anew and different response? For example, if a doorbell triggered anxiety,could you help the individual to either 1) respond in a different way tothe doorbell itself so that the doorbell became a trigger for say,relaxation, or 2) help the individual to use the first subjective feelings ofanxiety—i.e., tightness—to trigger a response such as relaxation?\"The professor thought for a while, did some mathematical formulason the blackboard, and then stated, \"Theoretically it's possible, particu-larly with animals, but probably unrealistic when it comes to peoplebecause of all the uncontrollable variables.\" He asked me what method-ology I would use and what apparatus did I believe would be needed toWeighing Anchors161experiment with. I responded that I wasn't sure of the methodology, butthe so-called \"apparatus\" would be hypnosis.He almost choked as he said, \"Hypnosis!? It doesn't exist, and evenif I could get people to respond as I had suggested, it wouldn't mattersince hypnosis wasn't science but witchcraft.\" In retrospect, I can \"see\"that he had been hypnotized into believing hypnosis didn't exist, and thatthe word \"hypnosis\" was the post-hypnotic \"cue\" (anchor) that elicitedhis somewhat weird response. Nonetheless, the incident with the reclinertriggered the memory of my earlier question or theory, and I again beganto wonder if it could be done. Based on what had happened to the manand his response to the recliner, I knew it was more than possible; that ithappened all the time in all of our lives.CALM CONDITIONINGMy first effort, or experiments, with what would later be termed\"anchors,\" and the methods that would become part of what I callUnconscious Restructuring®, were very primitive. I called it \"CalmConditioning.\" Simply put, I would ask an individual to \"remember\" thelast time they were, for example, afraid. As they \"remembered,\" I wouldobserve them for signs of discomfort such as tightness in the body or inthe face; or rapid breathing; or?When it looked to me that they were \"remembering\" it by feeling it, Iwould touch them (usually on the arm) and say, \"Good. Hold on to thatfeeling so that you can become very familiar with how it feels inside.\"Next, I would ask them to go back and re-experience that feeling again,but in slow motion, to become aware of the first strong physical sensa-tion such as tightening in the stomach or chest, or wherever, and to signalme by lifting the first finger of their right hand when they had that sensa-tion. I would then touch them on the spot I had touched before and tellthem to begin.When they signaled I would then apply a little more pressure to mytouch for a few moments, and then remove my hand. Then, I would askthem to take several deep breaths and think of the beach or mountains oranything pleasant. The next step was to ask them to remember the mostpleasant, relaxing place they have ever been—or to make one up in theirimagination—and to signal when they had accomplished that. They werethen asked to see themselves in that place again until they felt the calm,relaxed feelings that went with that experience, and to think of a word ortwo as a code to remind them of that pleasant place. I would then have"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"162Monsters & Magical Sticksthem \"practice\" saying the code word and seeing that place and feelingthose relaxed feelings.At this point, when we were successful, the individual had anassociated response to my touching them on the arm and asking them toremember the feeling of anxiety and another more pleasant associatedresponse to their code word. (I had not yet figured out that this procedurecould be accomplished without the need of code words.) The next stepwas to have them close their eyes and think of some situation that usuallycaused them to get anxious, and to signal when they had thought of it. Atthe same time, I would touch the spot on their arm to help them\"remember\" the anxious feeling they were to find. As soon as theysignaled, I would stop touching them and say somewhat sharply, \"Stop.[A pattern interruption.] Say your code word to yourself and see yourselfthere, feeling those pleasant feelings.\"This procedure would be practiced many times (6 or 8) and then theindividual, who by now would, in most cases, be in \"that state\" ofhypnosis, would be instructed as follows: \"Each time you feel that firstsignal of \"anxiety\" such as [filled in with what they had reported as thefirst signal], you are to think of your code word and see yourself there,feeling those comfortable feelings. As you practice this procedure, it willbecome more and more automatic until soon it will happen, in all theappropriate circumstances, without thinking and without your consciousawareness of having gone to your special place.\"PROTOCOL PROCEDUREIn spite of the primitiveness of this first approach, and my lack ofunderstanding of anchoring and systems (Visual—Kinesthetic—Auditory), it produced excellent results for the majority of people.Typically, they would report that when they used it, they would calmdown; and many people reported that, within a few days, they weregetting calm without thinking about it at all.We might conclude that they were using a new anchor automaticallywhich was generalizing to their real world. I would like to suggest thatyou...NOW...consider doing this procedure in a more updated form.Follow the above, but add the following refinements: Ask yourclient/patient to see the area that causes... (e.g., anxiety), and to seethemselves looking tense until it looks \"just right,\" and then to hearthemselves as they sound when they are... (e.g., tense), and to signal youwhen they have accomplished that. When they signal, ask them to floatWeighing Anchors163into the picture and into those \"uncomfortable feelings.\" When theysignal they have done that and/or when you see evidence of theirdiscomfort, touch them with light pressure on the arm (or ?) Then askthem to float out of the picture and out of the uncomfortable feelings and,as they are doing that, remove your hand; that is, stop touching them.Next, test your work.Touch the spot and ask them to get back into that picture and observeif they again show signs of discomfort. If they do, you have \"a take.\" Ifnot, repeat until you get the desired results. Next, after you haveascertained their first signal—i.e., tight face—repeat the same procedureas the above for their calm, relaxed place, and add a touch in a new spotwhen they signal they have that comfort. (Again, ask them to see theplace and then float into it, etc., and to think of a code word.) (Remembersystems.)With some people you may have to ask them to remember the feelingof...and then build a picture. However, make an effort to use seeingwithout feeling first. (The reason for that will be explained in the sectionon Therapeutic Applications in the next chapter, \"Anchors Away.\") Testthis work: i.e., touch the new spot and ask them to think of the codeword, and watch for signs you have a take. Now, use the rest of theprocedure; that is, ask them to remember something that upsets themwhile touching the discomfort spot, and as soon as they signal or showsigns, ask them to stop and say their code word and see themselves intheir special place and float into etc., etc. As you tell them to stop,remove your touch from the \"discomfort\" spot and switch to touchingtheir \"comfort\" spot. You may be pleasantly surprised at how well thisprocedure works and how many people enter \"that state\" without help.I could be wrong. You may not be surprised as to how well it worksand how many people enter that state now! Now that you understand thebasics of anchors and the theory behind this, we together can moveforward to Anchors Away!"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"XVIAnchors AwayBASIC ANCHOR COLLAPSESeveral years ago, or once upon a time, I was asked to give a lectureand demonstration to a psychology class at California State University atNorthridge. The professor, who was a very nice man, had told mebeforehand that he did not believe in hypnosis, that it did not workanyway, but he felt his class should have the opportunity of hearingabout it. I guess he wanted me to be the token hypnotist. To makematters even more interesting, he did not just introduce me and mysubject, rather he was prepared with a long statement about his disbeliefin hypnosis while stating he was open enough to give almost anybody achance to speak about what they believe. It was as if he had told them Ihad designed the Titanic and was now going to prove that it had notsunk.I decided that to survive my glowing introduction, I would have todemonstrate something dramatic, and on the professor. I knew from aprevious conversation with him that he was going through a very painfuldivorce and was—according to him—fighting depression whenever, \"Ithink about it.\" I thanked him for his introduction and, as he sat down ona long table at the front of the lecture hall, I walked over to him andostensibly began talking to the class. I told them that I really appreciatedthe Professor's asking me here and introducing me, particularly at thistime in his life when he was going through a very difficult period. Hisexpression immediately began to change as he looked down to his right(kinesthetic), and evidenced discomfort.At that point, I squeezed his right shoulder and said, \"I know that'spainful, isn't it?\" He nodded slowly. I then removed my hand and saidsharply, \"How long will it take you to remember now... [said more slowly164Anchors Away165and with a lower tone: an embedded hypnotic suggestion to remembernow] a time before you were 20 when you experienced something thatfelt so good that you knew everything was going to be exciting.\" (Takinga risk that most of us at some time before we were 20 did something orexperienced something that was exciting.)His head came up and his eyes began moving up to his left (visualrecall), and his face began to relax. Slowly he smiled, and then blushedand said, very strongly, \"I can remember.\" At this point, I had reached tohis left shoulder and began to gently squeeze it. Without any explanation,I was making an effort to set up two anchors: touch on his right shoulderfor the painful experience and touch on his left shoulder for the happyexperience. Next I tested the work. I said to him, \"That's a better feelingthan the other, isn't it?\" (Still squeezing his left shoulder.) He smiled andnodded vigorously. I then went on: \"Much better than this uncomfortablefeeling\" (Here my voice became sad-sounding and my face looked sad,while I squeezed his right shoulder.)The change was dramatic! He again looked as if his world wascoming to an end: eyes down right, head lowered, lips quivering. I thenswitched to his left shoulder while saying, \"You'd rather have thesefeelings, wouldn't you?\" (Said with happy tone and smiling face.) Heimmediately looked up, took a deep breath, smiled and said: \"What thehell are you doing to me?\" I replied, \"Confusion is new learning,\" andthen I squeezed both shoulders at the same time.His eyes glazed while he appeared to stare straight ahead, and helooked confused. I then instructed him as follows: \"You can close youreyes and it will all clear up comfortably\" (said slowly, in a low tone). Hesat very still, breathing deeply for about three minutes, and then openedhis eyes and asked what was going on. I reached over to squeeze his rightshoulder to make sure the anchor was cancelled. He showed no responseexcept, perhaps, a questioning one, but no \"depression.\" I asked him tothink about that painful situation, and to share with us what was differentin his internal response. He turned his eyes up left (visual recall) and thendown left (auditory) and then down right (kinesthetic) for one splitsecond, and looked up at me and said, \"It doesn't affect me like it did,and somehow I feel stronger and know it will be OK! What the hell didyou do?\"I replied, \"Nothing. There's no such thing as hypnosis so you mustbe hallucinating.\" (I guess what happened helped him to alter his beliefsystem. He attended two of my seminars, Clinical Hypnosis: Innovative"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"166Monsters & Magical SticksI Anchors Away167Techniques®, and became a booster and utilizer of hypnosis andUnconscious Restructuring®.)COLLAPSING ANCHORS: RATIONALENow, the above case may appear to be magic, and in a way it is.However, it is magic based on experimental research. In one classicexperiment, experimental animals were conditioned to go to one side of acage at the sound of a bell, and the other side at the sound of a buzzer.Almost like squeezing the left shoulder for one feeling and the rightshoulder for another. When both stimuli were set off at the same time,the animals would appear to be confused and disoriented, and would thennot respond to either stimuli. (Almost like what happened when Isqueezed both of his shoulders at the same time...it does make youwonder now about the implications.)Most individuals who are put through the above procedure reportwhat comes very close to being cognitive dissonance; and someresearchers claim that new learning does not take place without cognitivedissonance. Cognitive Dissonance has been defined as \"a motivationalstate which exists when an individual's cognitive elements (attitudes,perceived behaviors, etc.) are inconsistent with each other.\" The tensionproduced by this state may be reduced by adding consonant elements,changing one of the dissonant element so that it is no longer inconsistentwith the other, or \"by reducing the importance of the dissonantelements.\" (Wolman, 1973, p. 66)However, I want to caution you: as powerful as this technique canbe, it isn't a panacea or a cure. All it does is to help an individual have\"lowered emotionality\" to a stressful situation, produce a calming effectand give the individual hope about solving their problem when they canexperience such a marked change within several minutes. But, it's not acure. It only accomplishes in five to ten minutes what three to eighttraditional sessions might accomplish.CASE 11: ANCHOR COLLAPSEA briefcase will underline this view: Patient was a 21-year-old manwhose presenting problem was severe depression. In his own words: \"Mydepression was so heavy that I think I made myself have a breakdown.\"He had spent three weeks in a hospital as a result of a voluntarycommitment. After checking out of the hospital, he had entered therapyand, at the time of first seeing me, had been to five sessions of therapy.He believed he was beginning to understand what had caused hisdepression, but he was still severely depressed.He stated, \"I'm beginning to lose hope. I'm in therapy and yet I'mstill depressed almost all the time.\" While he described his depressionverbally, he also \"described\" it physically: body posture slumped, eyesdown right, voice sad and flat. As he talked about how \"heavy\" hisdepression was, and continued to evidence it physically, I reached over,gently touched his left knee, and said in a voice that mimicked his,\"That's a heavy, awful feeling, isn't it?\" He shook his head slowly. I thensnapped my fingers (pattern interruption) and said, \"Before your problembegan, what did you really enjoy doing?\" His head moved up slowly, helooked at me for a moment, and then his eyes went up left, and he said,\"Baseball. I love the game! I'm a pitcher on the University team.\" Iasked him if he ever had a really good day pitching. He smiled and said\"Oh yeah! I once pitched a three hitter and struck out the last five battersin a row.\"At this point, he had straightened up in the chair, and his voice wasstronger and melodious. I replied, \"You're kidding. Really?\" He leanedforward, smiled, and said, \"Yeah, honestly.\" At that moment, I reachedover and gently touched his right knee and said, \"That's great! I bet youreally felt good!\" He was now smiling and looked much better. Toreinforce his plus (+) anchor, I asked him to describe how he felt insideafter striking out the last five batters, and as he described the goodfeeling, I again touched his right knee. I repeated this procedure as hedescribed, in response to my questions, how he looked and how hesounded. All of the above took less than ten minutes, and the young manwas much more relaxed and he was smiling.Next, I used the same procedure as on the professor described above.When he had \"neutralized\" out, I asked him to \"Try Hard\" (implying itwould be very difficult) to remember the depressed feeling. He lookedstraight ahead for a few moments, then looked down right for a splitsecond, brought his eyes back up level and said, \"Hey, I'm having a hardtime getting it back...anyhow I don't want it back. That's amazing. Youmean there's hope for me after all?\" As I nodded my head yes, I said,\"What do you think?\" He nodded his head and said, \"Yeah, I'm going tobeat it.\" He was referred back to his therapist who, several weeks later,reported that the young man was doing fine, was back in school andbeginning to make some decisions about the situations that had led to hisdepression."},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"168Monsters & Magical SticksThe above procedure is a basic \"anchor collapse\" and I will attemptto give you the skills to begin testing and practicing it so that you canjudge the results for yourself. I want you to consider personal problemsas an anchor or a series of anchors as explained in Chapter XIV,\"Weighing Anchors.\" Your job is to help the individual have a choice asto their response to their painful anchors: that is, to collapse theundesired response or.. .Anchors Away!ANCHOR COLLAPSE: BASIC PROCEDUREIf possible, you first want to establish a pleasant (+) anchor. Whileanchors can be set with visual, auditory and/or kinesthetic cues, I amgoing to recommend you begin with kinesthetic cues (physical touches)as they are the easiest to learn and use, even though beginning withkinesthetics might cause you to miss with a few individuals. However, ifyour client/patient is already in a bad place—e.g., depressed—don'twork like mad to get them in a better place in order to set a + anchor andthen throw them back into their bad place for the unpleasant (-) anchor.In that case, start by anchoring that feeling (- anchor).I recommend that you sit directly in front of the individual, closeenough to be able to touch their knees. Let's assume the individual'spresenting complaint is being depressed whenever they are alone, but asthey talk to you they appear to be pretty level. Ask them to remember atime they really felt good about something they accomplished whilebeing alone; e.g. \"Can you remember a time you took a ride by yourselfand really enjoyed the scenery or a time you were working on yourhobby and felt pleased.\" (Use your imagination.) When they say, \"Yes,\"watch them carefully. Some people will begin to smile and showpleasure just from being asked. If they show a pleasurable response,gently, but firmly, press on one knee (doesn't matter which) and suggest,with a cheerful voice and a smile, something to the effect, \"That's a nicefeeling, isn't it?\" (You are establishing the + anchor.)If the individual merely says \"yes,\" but doesn't evidence the\"pleasure\" in their expression, you must go further. (Systems becomemore important here; assume a visual person for this example.) Ask themto see that pleasurable situation, or to see how they looked in thatpleasurable situation, or to \"show me what you look like when you feelgood.\" Next, ask them to remember the sounds of that experience, orhow they sounded when they were feeling good. Next, ask them todescribe what they feel when they feel good. As soon as they \"show\" theAnchors Away169good feeling in their experience, establish the + anchor: that is, gentlypress on one knee (let's say the left) and say in a cheerful way, \"That's anice feeling,\" or \"That feels good\" or... Be creative but not incongruent.(At my training seminars, I have observed people saying, \"That's a nicefeeling, isn't it\" while frowning and talking with a voice that would makean optimist sad.)After you have established the + anchor, repeat the procedure toestablish the - anchor; i.e., \"Now, Mr. Smith, you told me you have beenfeeling depressed.\" Observe his facial expression, and, if it changes toone of sadness or depression, gently touch his other knee. If the facialexpression doesn't change, use systems again: \"How do you see yourselfwhen you are depressed?\" (Remember we are assuming a visual personfor this example.) As soon as you observe the facial change, install the -anchor.TESTINGAt this point, in all probability, you will have established a + and a -anchor. You now want to test your work. This is either a simple proce-dure or a very easy one depending on your attitude: Touch the + anchor(left knee in our example) and, with a cheerful voice and face, say some-thing like, \"I'll bet you like this feeling better don't you?\" Watch care-fully to make sure that their general expression and demeanor matchesthe + anchor. If so, let go of the + anchor; touch the - anchor and saysomething like, \"It's much better than the depressed feeling, isn't it?\"(Be congruent; use a sad tone and facial expression.) Check to see thattheir expression, etc. matches the - anchor. If so, you have a take. (If not,go back and reinstall the + and - anchors, taking time to get the responseyou want.) After testing the - anchor, it is always a good choice to retirethe + anchor; i.e., \"Bet you really like this good feeling better,\" whiletouching the + anchor.We can now stop and try to make rational sense out of what has justhappened. If we do so, we have forgotten to remember there's no suchthing as hypnosis. Another way to consider what you have accomplishedis to assume that the touch on the left leg has become a hypnotic cue thathelps the individual to respond to the \"suggested\" good feeling, while atouch on the right leg is a hypnotic (non-verbal) \"suggestion\" to respondwith the \"depressed\" feeling.Now that's crazy. How can we call that stuff hypnosis? No one waswearing a cape or waving a crystal ball, or telling the subject to go"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"170Monsters & Magical Sticksdeeper and deeper. So, don't call it hypnosis. Call it anchoring, or stimu-lus response or magic. It doesn't matter because deep down, comfortably,you know what it really is. (Those of you who are experienced in so-called traditional hypnosis may notice some interesting phenomena.While inserting and testing + and - anchors, you will see many individ-uals evidencing pupil dilation, altered breathing rates, flaccidity of thefacial muscles and an almost trance-like state of attention. Accept yourbonus with good grace! An altered state without a so-called induction.)COLLAPSING: COMPLETEDAt this point you have completed the major work for basic anchoring.You have \"polarized,\" (that is, separated) and established two distinctstates in the individual: a + anchor and a - anchor. Next is AnchorsAway, which enables the individual to substantially reduce his painfulresponse—in our example, the feelings of depression when alone.Anchors Away is accomplished by simply pressing on the + (left knee)anchor and - (right knee) anchor simultaneously, and holding both untilthe individual \"neutrals\" out.\"Neutrals\" out simply means that, when you first touch both anchors,the individual will look confused, often spaced-out, with either staring ordarting eyes. After a few seconds, the confused, spaced-out look willdisappear and the individual will look...well...neutral.Next, you test your work by touching the - anchor and waiting. If theindividual remains neutral—that is, does not go back to the \"depressed\"state when you touch the anchor—you have then accomplished yourbasic anchor away or anchor collapse. If the individual collapses backinto the - anchor, reinstall a new + anchor and repeat until the - anchorfails to elicit any negative response. My experience, both personally andby having observed several hundred people at my training seminars,leads me to conclude that in only about 20% of the cases will you need toreinstall a second or third + anchor in order to collapse the - anchor.COLLAPSING: SUBTLETIESBefore we move onto the next step of anchors away, I would like tooffer some subtleties for you to be aware of. If the individual's negativestate—e.g., depression—is extreme, you may need to establish a some-what equally powerful + anchor—that is, a powerful + experience—ortwo, or three + anchors; or you may need to collapse and reinstall a new+ anchor, recollapse both anchors, and repeat that procedure until the -Anchors Away171anchor is neutralized. Next, please be aware that not all people willrespond in the same way. Some people will respond with full facial andbody expression, while others may only clench their jaw or smileslightly. It doesn't matter as long as you can see the change.Some individuals smile immediately when their + anchor is touched,while others may take 10 to 15 seconds to respond. Always give theindividual time to respond and watch for their way of responding, notyour version of how they should respond. You may find the followingexamples helpful.At one training seminar, a participant took me aside and told me, \"It\"wasn't working. Further he told me that, at first, he was doubtful aboutthe whole procedure, yet he had observed it working with other people. Iwent with him to his practice group, and asked him to repeat the proce-dure while I watched what he did. After he repeated the procedure hesaid, \"See! It's not working. He doesn't respond at all!\" I pressed the +anchor (in this case the subject's right shoulder) and said, \"You like thatfeeling don't you?\" The subject nodded very slightly and I then pressedthe - anchor (left shoulder) and said, \"That's uncomfortable, isn't it?\" Henodded again. I then pressed both and, after a few moments, I said,\"That's much better, isn't it?\" The subject smiled and said \"Yes.\"The man who had called me aside looked stunned. I pointed out thatwhen he himself pressed the subject's + anchor, the subject took a slowdeep breath and looked straight ahead, while, when he pressed the -anchor, the subject stopped breathing for several moments and his lipspressed tightly together. In short, the response was there, but he wasn'twatching. In most cases, the responses will be obvious, but be a boy orgirl scout: be prepared for the unusual.At another seminar, a woman told me she couldn't get her subject torespond to a + anchor, but only a - anchor, and that the subject insistedhe couldn't get a good feeling. I happened to know that he had justcompleted a divorce and, according to him, had lost everything. I walkedover and said, \"John, how would you like to find out that you just cameinto $250,000 after taxes?\" He looked up, smiled and said, \"Would I!?\"At that point, I squeezed his arm and said cheerfully, \"I knew you couldremember how to feel good.\" I asked the woman to complete the exerciseand it went without a hitch. In short, be creative. Treat each person as anindividual. If you don't get the desired outcome the first time, use a dif-ferent approach."},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"172Monsters & Magical SticksLast, but not least, always test the - anchor after you have pressedboth to make sure it is collapsed, and only then ask the subject to thinkabout what was making him/her \"depressed\" and to tell you what is dif-ferent. The general responses will be: \"It seems different\" or \"It's fartheraway,\" or \"It seems less important,\" etc. The reason for not asking untilthe last is that there are times when the individual is so far behind theirunconscious process, that they don't realize the change until you havetested and \"shown\" them.BUILDING A NEW RESPONSEWhere the individual's problem is continually being triggered by areal world condition, you must help them to have a new resource for thatsituation. This will help prevent the \"re-triggering\" of the old - anchor.There are several ways to accomplish this, but I am going to give youone general way and trust you to develop some others. In our example ofthe depressed patient, I would ask him to remember some accomplish-ment or experience in his life that he was pleased with, or even better,proud of. Once he has acknowledged one, I would use systems to anchorthat experience: \"When you bowled that 250 game, how did you feel?\"\"How do you think you looked when you were feeling...?\" How doesyour voice sound when you're feeling... ?\"At each response, I press gently on the anchor point (which can bewherever you want and good sense dictates). After pressing the anchorfor the kinesthetic response, the visual response, and/or the auditoryresponse, I proceed as follows: \"Now, I want you to see yourself alone,but this time I want you to experience a change in the way you feel [hereI press the + anchor] and see yourself looking good as you feel a certainstrong feeling.\" (Still holding the + anchor) \"Now, let's take another situ-ation where you are alone and again notice a growing feeling of strength\"(again holding the + anchor). \"Next, I want you to see yourself [holding+ anchor] in one of those alone situations, but see yourself lookingcomfortable and feeling comfortable and nod your head when you haveaccomplished that.\"Lastly, stop pressing the + anchor and ask the subject to think aboutone of those situations that \"in the past\" caused those \"old\" feelings, andto see what happens now. I observe to \"see\" that they remain calm andcomfortable. If so, it's time to call it a day. If not, I go and find anotherpositive experience, preferably one that matches the problem situation:e.g., \"Can you remember a time you were working on a project alone,Anchors Away173and you felt relieved no one was disturbing you?\" I repeat the lastdescribed anchor experience until the individual evidences comfort while\"seeing\" the problem area.ANCHORING ANCHORSBy this time, I trust that you are anchored into the importance ofanchoring. Since words, visual stimuli, kinesthetic experience, olfactoryand gustatory experience can be, and are, all anchors, then each one of ushas unlimited anchors. Why not use what we all are expert at in the firstplace: Anchoring others! If you will now consider all problems as a formof anchoring, then a hair of the dog may be the most effective way ofhelping your patients and clients.The fact that many individuals will \"insist\" on entering into hypnosisas you utilize anchoring is just something you will have to accept and if,when you collapse an anchor, you ask the individual to close their eyesand they do so, I hope you won't take it personally when they drift off tothat \"other\" state."},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"XVIIConfessions Of A HypnotistNow that I have your attention (I hope), I have a confession to make.At times throughout this book, I have referred to the section on Thera-peutic Applications, but there will be no such section. Before you hangme in effigy, read on. Throughout this work, my co-author, Ms. Steele,continued to push, shove and cajole me into clarifying techniques, vari-ous approaches, and to give examples which would make sense to you,the reader.In order to do so, actual cases and therapeutic examples have beenused in almost every Chapter. Therefore, you have already read Thera-peutic Applications: one part here, one part there, and a little everywhere.Instead of a so-called Therapeutic Applications chapter, I will presentseveral case examples in which the techniques you have learned wereeither the sole methods, or nearly the sole methods, used. In addition, afew points that have not yet been covered will be in this Chapter. I knowyou will find the examples given to be useful and valuable in your pro-cess of integrating what you have learned.CASE 12:Patient is a 45-year-old woman whose presenting problem is phobicfear of flying. (Actually, there is no such thing as a phobic fear of flying.There is a phobic fear of crashing! Think about it.) History: Patientreported that her flying phobia was of 22 years duration, but that she had\"always\" been leery of flying. As a child, her father had often madecomments about the danger of flying and that \"sooner or later flying willkill you. It's only a matter of time.\" In spite of her father's \"helpfulness,\"she had been able to fly, though with a good deal of anxiety. Her phobicresponse dated from the time (22 years earlier) when a plane she was on174Confessions Of A Hypnotist175lost an engine and had to make an emergency landing. That incidentbecame the trigger for her phobia, or an anchor response.About one year prior to seeing me, she had attempted to fly to NewYork after taking Valium and several drinks. However, as soon as shegot on the plane, she \"freaked out\" and had to be let off the airplane. Dueto business circumstances, it had now become very important for her tobe able to fly.After she had seated herself in my office, I asked her to tell me abouther problem. She immediately looked up to her right (visual). At thispoint (I could not tell if she was making future or constructive pictures,or if she was left-handed or cross-brained and, therefore, having pastvisual recall), her hands grasped the arms of the chair, tightened, and sheheld her breath. Then, in a tight voice, she said, \"I am terrified of flying,and I don't think anything can help.\" At this point, I knew the source ofher response: she, upon thinking, speaking or hearing about flying(which would be the trigger) made visual images and responded to those\"pictures\" with physical feelings and emotions that matched her pictures.While she continued looking up right and stayed tight, I reached overand squeezed her left wrist and said, \"That's a bad feeling, isn't it?\"(Installing the - anchor.) She nodded. I then asked her who her favoritegrade school teacher was. This was done to both break her pattern and todiscover where she would look for past recall. Her eyes went up left andshe relaxed substantially. I now knew that her \"phobia\" response wasfrom constructing future pictures, probably of a plane crashing, and thenresponding kinesthetically.After several minutes of making disjointed small talk, jumping fromone subject to another (to continue interrupting her pattern and keep heraway from her \"phobic response\"), I asked her what she really liked todo, and did well. She looked up left, smiled, looked down left (auditory),smiled, her face and body relaxed, and she said, \"Golf. I really lovegolf!\" I asked her what about golf sounded best (remember her auditoryeye movement). She said the crisp sound of a well-hit ball; with that, shesmiled and her whole body relaxed. I touched her left knee (installing +anchor) and said, \"That's a feeling you really enjoy.\" Next, I asked her toremember a time she played an outstanding round of golf or made areally great shot. (Eyes up left (V) down left (A) and to a big smile whileI pressed her left knee again and her left forearm, installing a second +anchor.)"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"I76Monsters & Magical SticksConfessions Of A Hypnotist177TESTING THE WORKAt this juncture, we have accomplished the following: Discoveredthe internal source of her problem; her - anchor; her system for pleasantmemories; installed the - anchor and two + anchors. All of this wasaccomplished within 15 minutes from the time she first sat down. Nextcame testing the work.I reached over, squeezed her left wrist and said, \"Your fear of flyingreally concerns you, doesn't it?\" Immediately her eyes went up right,body tight, etc. Before she could say anything, I let go of her wrist,touched her left knee and said, \"But you also know how to feel good.\"She relaxed, eyes flickered briefly up left, down left, and then she lookedat me, smiled, and made some comment on how fast her feelingschanged. I repeated the test again, mainly to \"show\" her, on a non-verbal,unconscious level, how much control she really had over her feelings.My next step was to touch her left knee and squeeze her left wrist at thesame time, thereby collapsing the anchors. After she \"neutralized,\" Iasked her to think about flying. She looked straight ahead (indicating anunconscious change or restructure), evidenced some tension, and said, \"Itstill upsets me, but it's not nearly so bad.\"RESTRUCTURINGI then explained to her how she was able to respond to her pictures,and I was going to help her have a chance to separate her feelings fromher pictures (This is one example of the importance of getting people tofloat out the picture as referred to in Chapter XVI, \"Anchors Away.\") Iasked her to see herself on a roller coaster, and to feel what happened.She responded with observable body sensations. I then asked her to seeherself in the roller coaster as if it were someone else, while she silentlynamed her present feelings of sitting in the chair. She was surprised atthe difference in her physical response. I now touched her second +anchor (left forearm) and said, \"You remember how to feel good, don'tyou?\" As she responded to the + anchor, I instructed her to hold onto thegood feeling while she saw herself flying with comfort. We repeated this4 or 5 times. I then removed my touch and asked her to think aboutflying. She looked straight ahead, then down left, then straight aheadagain (compare that with her initial eye pattern response), and said,\"Well, it's not my favorite experience, but I can handle it; it doesn't seemto bother me very much.\"The rest of the session was taken up with teaching her Calm Condi-tioning. (See Chapter XV, \"Weighing Anchors.\") She was instructed topractice seeing herself flying and, at the first sign of discomfort, toswitch to her calm place. She was asked to return the following week sothat we could check her work. When she returned, she told me that astrange thing had happened. After two days of practicing calm condition-ing, she couldn't concentrate on flying; that every time she tried to seeherself flying, her mind would wander and she would find herselfremembering pleasant past situations. She also told me that she had madereservations to make a business trip and would send me a postcard. Oneweek later, I got the postcard. It said, \"It's still not my favorite activity,but it's better than going to the dentist.\"CASE 13:Patient was a 57-year-old male hospitalized with terminal cancerwhich had metastasized through areas of his skeletal system. He was inintensive care and, in spite of four to five injections of morphine dailyalong with oral pain medications, he was suffering intractable pain,insomnia and extreme agitation. His physician asked me to see him aboutpain control as well as reduction of the patient's agitated state.When first seen, the patient was complaining in a very harsh toneabout his pain. He was thrashing in the bed, and generally being verballyhostile to everyone. (Which, given his circumstances, was to a degreeunderstandable) I noticed that his room contained a portable stereo, asmall radio and a small tape recorder. Based on the way he was using hisvoice (complaining, harsh tone, using many words), and the equipment Ihad observed, it would be a good guess to assume that he was highlyauditory. Since his cancer was causing him pain (throwing him intonearly constant kinesthetic), I knew I needed to get him back to, and thenanchor him into, auditory with his visual as a backup system.UTILIZING SYSTEMSAfter introducing myself and gathering some information about hishobbies (he loved listening to music), as well as some areas he felt com-petent in (one of which was working with wood), I was ready to proceed.I asked him if he would mind doing me a favor. (This is a ploy designedto elicit a desire to help me and thereby begin taking an individual'smind off their problem.) I then asked him to close his eyes and listen towhat his pain sounded like. He stared at me in disbelief, and I acknowl-"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"I78Monsters & Magical Sticksedged that it was a strange request, but I really needed him to do me thatfavor.With that, he closed his eyes and appeared to be concentrating.Almost immediately, his breathing deepened and he became much morestill (still moving but without the almost wild thrashing). After a minuteor so, he opened his eyes and said, \"It's like a terrible grinding sound.\" Iasked him to close his eyes again and listen to the grinding sound todiscover how much it might sound like one of his woodworking grindersor drills. In a few moments he nodded slowly.I next asked him to get a clear picture of the tool that most remindedhim of the sound and to nod when he had it—which he did within a fewseconds. I then asked him to \"see\" that tool or machine across the roomin his mind's eye, and to speed it up as fast as he could. Within severalseconds, he nodded again. I then instructed him to \"see\" the tool ormachine slowing down, little by little, until it had stopped.As he nodded this time, I gently squeezed his left shoulder and sim-ply said, \"That's good; you're really helping.\" (Intentionally not specify-ing who or what he was helping.) At this point, his transformation wasremarkable. He was no longer moving around, his breathing was verydeep and slow, his face was relaxed, and his color had changed.The next step in my procedure was to help him remember how hecould forget annoyances. This was done by talking slowly and in a lowtone (remember his auditory) about working on wood and how you couldturn on loud equipment such as a grinder and not even notice the noise;that he became so deeply involved in what he was making, that he forgotthe noise! He slowly nodded. Since we had already established that hispain sounded like grinding, I was betting that he would make the connec-tion between forgetting the sound and forgetting the pain.During this monologue, I continued the gentle squeeze on his leftshoulder. I then began to discuss listening to music, and how easy it wasto lose track of time and place when you're really engrossed; and howyou could almost float away from everything while listening to music.He nodded slowly again. (By this time he was so much into \"that state\"that he didn't respond to nurses and other staff coming into the room.)I ended this first session by telling him that I didn't know just whatsounds around him were going to remind him of floating away. While Icontinued to gently squeeze his shoulder, I began to mention commonhospital sounds that might do that—in short, anchoring him into\"floating\" away as a result of hearing the hospital sounds.Confessions Of A Hypnotist179RESULTSWhen I returned to see him two days later, he had been transferredfrom intensive care to the observation unit as a result of the changes hehad evidenced. He had begun sleeping through the night; he was eating;and his attitude had undergone a remarkable change for the better. Inaddition, he had had only one shot each of the two days, and hadsubstantially reduced his intake of other drugs.In this second session, I \"taught\" him how to \"see\" and/or \"hear\" hispain so that he could begin to take more responsibility for his treatment,and then I basically repeated the steps of his first session. By the thirdsession, which was six days after I first saw him, he had not required anyshots and only two Valiums (one each on two different nights) to \"helpme sleep.\" The day after his third session, he was discharged from thehospital.Several weeks later, I received a very nice letter from his wife. In itshe stated that he was still almost totally pain free, with occasionalValium use at bedtime; that he was cheerful and spent a lot of time in hisworkshop finishing (wood) projects that he had started over the years.(We could say he was reinforcing his hypnotic suggestion by actualwork.)CASE 14:A 25-year-old, newly-married woman was referred by her physicianfor what he termed \"frigidity.\" Her history indicated, however, that shewas touch phobic. She told me that if she got stoned enough she couldhave sex and respond, but, when sober, she became almost physicallysick from being touched in any \"sexual\" way. She also stated that she didnot like to be touched in any way by anyone.I positioned myself in such a way that my right foot was close to herleft foot, while being careful to maintain a \"discreet\" distance from her. Ithen proceeded to tell her stories, ask questions and make general com-ments to elicit in her a smile or laughter. Each time she laughed orsmiled, I pressed my foot against hers very gently. I asked her about anypleasant vacations she had been on. As she responded with a smile, Iwould press my foot against hers again.When telling me about her problem, she would look up (V past)while tensing up in the chair, (K manifestation). However, while discuss-ing pleasant experiences, she would look up left (V past) down left (A),look at me (V present) and smile (K present). This procedure continued"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"i8oMonsters & Magical Sticksfor about 20 minutes, at which point I moved my body in closer to her.After some joke or story she laughed heartily and, as she did so, Ireached over and touched her left wrist and said, \"Laughter looks goodon you; I bet it feels even better.\" She nodded and said, \"It sure does.\"I continued to find ways to elicit smiles or laughter and continued totouch her left wrist until finally I just left my hand resting on hers andsaid, \"Well, it appears you can see yourself [keeping it visual] learning tohave good feelings while being touched.\" She looked down at my handon her wrist, looked puzzled, looked up and said, \"Well, I'll be damned!\"At the end of her first session, I walked her out into the lobby, whereseveral people were seated. I told her I would see her next week, andwith that, she turned and gave me almost a bear hug and said, \"God, Ifeel great!\" Her action put me into hypnosis, but it also indicated how farshe had come in one session.For her second session, the procedure was a basic anchor collapse:Inserting several + anchors and then eliciting her bad feelings at beingtouched (which at this point weren't very bad at all), installing the -anchor, and then collapsing. Lastly, she was taught calm conditioning,and was instructed to practice seeing herself being intimate with her hus-band while either holding on to the calm feeling, or, if she experiencedanxiety, to switch to her calm place. A follow-up several months laterrevealed that she not only was over her \"frigidity\" but she had no prob-lem with touching.COMMENTOver the years I have evolved a theory about so-called touch phobia,and find the condition simple to ameliorate. First, I believe that thiscondition arises because a person's history is one of almost never beingtouched as a child except when they were hurt or were being punished. Inshort, they have been anchored into associating pain with touch.Secondly, based on this belief, the procedure—as outlined in this case—collapses the old anchor and installs a new association or anchor: plea-surable feelings and touch. At my training seminars, I explain this to theparticipants and ask them to check it out and keep me informed. Fromthe results, I must conclude that the theory is correct or the techniquesproduce the results in spite of my theory.Confessions Of A Hypnotist181CASE 15:This will be a brief case as reported by a former seminar participant.Her client was a man in his mid-forties with a presenting problem ofsevere headaches resulting from almost constant jaw clenching. Herapproach was to continue to anchor collapse: that is, she would ask theman to remember something pleasant, install a + anchor and then askhim to clench his jaw while she fired off the + anchor. She repeated thisprocedure over and over during a one hour session: installing a + anchor,asking him to clench, firing the + anchor. Her client reported the follow-ing week that every time he started to clench his teeth, something clickedand he would find himself remembering something pleasant and his jawwould relax. He also reported that he had only two headaches in thewhole week.She simply repeated her procedure for the second session, and herclient reported a complete absence of headaches. A follow-up call onemonth later (his calling her at her request), indicated that he was stillsymptom free and, in addition, that he was sleeping better and had muchmore energy.In outlining her case to me, she pointed out that when her client wasclenching his jaw, he was also looking down left. This would indicate ahear/feel loop: that is, talking to himself (A) and responding with jawclenching (K). However, when discussing pleasant things, he looked upleft, then right, then straight ahead and would smile (V past, visualfuture, visual present with kinesthetic response). After the first session,two unconscious changes were noted: When he would look down left (A)and just as he would start to clench (K), he would immediately look upleft (V past) and then straight ahead with no jaw clenching or he wouldlook down left (A) and pull his head up (K) and look straight ahead (Vpresent).From the above cases, you may conclude that it sounds too easy.Well, you can lead a camel to water, but you can't make it fly a 747! Attraining seminars, I have observed someone do a procedure beautifully,get observable results, have the subject verify it, and yet they complainthere must be more to it. By the time they are done hypnotizing them-selves into believing that it must be harder than that, or that there's got tobe a catch, they have made it difficult or impossible for themselves. Tome, that's crazy. But, if everyone were rational and made sense, I wouldhave to find another way to make a living."},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"XVIIIRamblingsI don't know about you, the reader, but writing this last Chapter elic-its mixed feelings within me. I am, at the same time, relieved and gladthat the damned thing is finished, and yet strangely sad. Ms. Steele andmyself have put lots of hours, effort, research and the proverbial blood,sweat and tears into this work. As you have probably surmised by now, Iam not, nor will I ever be an academician, and, therefore, I found writingabout Unconscious Restructuring®, hypnosis, and my approach to be farmore difficult than the actual doing.Since you are reading this part, I can assume you were stubbornenough, curious enough, and perverse enough to have read all that haspreceded. With those qualities, I know you will be successful in utilizingwhat...you have learned! I also hope you will permit me to ramble, andeven if you don't, it's my intention to do so.While growing up as a hypnotist, I always resented those books inwhich it was implied 1) that the author never \"missed,\" and, 2) that thesuccesses were always instantaneous—while the method of producingthe \"miracle\" was somehow, strangely missing. Two pages might bedevoted to detailing the seriousness and difficulty of the problem, whilethe methodology would be reduced to, \"After three [or 2 or 1 or 4]sessions in which hypnosis was induced and strong suggestion given, thepatient was forever happy (or?).That always reminded me of fairy tales in which the prince andprincess rode off to live happily ever after...but no one told you aboutthe next day. To put it another way, I always had the feeling I either hadmissed something (the method) or was just plain dumb (perhaps I shouldhave known the method). I sincerely hope I have avoided those two situa-182Ramblings183tions in this work. First, I have made every effort to give you, in detail,the method, words and approach used with each individual. Secondly, Iwant to make it clear that at times I fail miserably, and fall flat onmy...(fill in). That is not a comment on Unconscious Restructuring®,but rather on my failure to have used the approach wisely; or to havefailed in being observant enough; or times I have allowed myself tobecome impatient from overwork or too few vacations; or from being toosloppy. However, I believe I have learned and improved my methodmore from the so-called failures than from the successes.REVIEW: BELIEF SYSTEMSNow that I have \"that\" out of the way, I would like to ramble aboutthe subject of the book itself. When an individual presents him/herself atyour office, I believe that they are saying in effect: \"My belief system ispreventing me from exercising new choices.\" If their belief system waseffective in the problem area, they would have solved the problem andwould not need you. If you accept their belief system as being true inreality, then you not only have been hypnotized by them, you also runthe risk of perpetuating and becoming part of that problem.Therefore, your first task is to help them expand and/or challenge thebelief system that is keeping them stuck. Next, you must consider that aform of self-hypnosis is keeping their belief system going. That individ-ual is somehow hallucinating to stay stuck; for example: \"not seeing\"times they have been \"liked\" while finding evidence they are disliked—which in traditional hypnotist circles would be recognized as positive andnegative hallucinations. When you argue with a person who is \"seeing\"or \"not seeing\" an hypnotic hallucination, they entrench and becomemore \"positive\" of what they \"see\" or \"don't see.\" So, whether you usehypnosis formally or not, I believe you must be aware of the hypnoticfactor involved in maintaining the individual's painful state. You eitheruse this awareness, or end up being a hypnotic subject yourself.REVIEW: SYSTEMSI further contend that a person who is functioning well, either in allareas or some area, is utilizing all systems (V—K—A) in a synergisticmanner, while the more that individual relies on one system to the exclu-sion of one or more of the other systems, the less choice they have avail-able, and the more stuck and in pain they become. Within every system is"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"184Monsters & Magical Sticksstored experiences, knowledge and the skills that can lead to newchoices, behaviors and responses.If a person \"sees\" himself failing, you may help them to remember atime they \"felt\" successful, and that feeling may help them build a pic-ture of being successful. The new picture will itself lead to a challenge ofthe old belief system. If an individual has always been \"told\" theyshouldn't speak up, you can help them recall visually times they sawpeople speak up; that visual memory can help them change their beliefthat they shouldn't speak up. It is therefore incumbent upon the therapistto help the individual expand and balance his systems.Where therapists continue to use the same system as the individual,and accept the individual's belief system, then the client/patient is doingan exquisite job of causing the therapist to \"see\" or \"hear\" or \"feel\" thesame way the patient does. Of course, we must keep in mind there's nosuch thing as hypnosis. By recognizing the individual's limited use ofsystems and their self-defeating belief systems, the therapist immediatelybecomes equipped with a multitude of choices as to how to proceed tohelp the individual.If someone is lost in the wilderness, it is foolish to build a base sta-tion and wait for them to find you. You have to go where they are andlead them out. To sum up the point, we could say that the individual hasbeen hypnotized into believing that certain things are a certain way andwill always be that way. Through circumstances, the individual, in hisproblem area at least, begins to develop reliance on a particular system—whether kinesthetic, visual or auditory—for attempting to deal with theproblem. Through these processes, the person begins to \"distort\" reality,and by so doing, they continue to \"see,\" \"hear\" and \"feel\" the same thingover and over. In effect, they keep themselves in a hypnotic state duringwhich their belief system takes precedence over so-called \"consensual\"reality. I believe that if you use the same mechanism that produces theproblem—hypnosis—you can help them to quickly break patterns,develop new skills and respond with new choices. If a person already isskilled at using a hammer, help them to use the hammer differently whileshowing them how to use a screwdriver. Don't demand they fly a planeinstead. (You will have to think about that.)REVIEW: PATTERN INTERRUPTIONI would like you to consider that human beings are energy conserv-ing (some would say lazy). We build machines to do our work, and thenRamblings185machines to run our machines, and then use computers to supervise. Thisis said to point out that people naturally streamline their behavior intopatterns: patterns that are repetitive and energy conserving. Where thesepatterns are effective and lead to successful outcomes, we have a goodsystem. However, where an individual continues to repeat painful pat-terns—e.g., becomes \"depressed\" every weekend, or when they arealone, etc.—it then becomes an \"absolute must\" to interrupt those(painful) patterns and help them to develop more effective patterns ofresponse.As we pointed out earlier, where a pattern is interrupted, an individ-ual will often go into a hypnotic state. This gives you a golden opportu-nity to help them to install a new and more efficacious response. Sincewe all have long and successful histories of learning, unlearning andchanging patterns, it is already built into the system to change patterns.However, no human being develops a pattern unless, at some point intheir history, that pattern \"seemed\" necessary. That is not to say it wasnecessary, only that it seemed so. Therefore, part of the individual'sbelief system is that the pattern is needed. Helping them to break patternsalso may help them to challenge belief systems without ever discussingbelief systems.I've said it before, and I want to say it again: \"Therapy, any therapy,succeeds where, by hook or by crook, on purpose or by accident, thetherapist has helped the individual to break a pattern and substitute a newpattern in its place.\"After working with hundreds of individuals in my clinical practiceand giving dozens of training seminars, I have become convinced of thefollowing: People respond in their problem areas (and, perhaps, in theirsuccessful areas) as an hypnotic subject would to so-called post-hypnoticsuggestion. They will tell you that, \"Every time s/he looks or talksor.. .that way, I get depressed or angry or [fill in],\" or \"Every time I thinkof...I become...\" If you compare these phenomena and the individual'sconsistency of response with the literature on post-hypnotic suggestion, Ibelieve that you, too, will be struck by the similarity. If you accept thisthesis, then it stands to reason that hypnotic techniques are the antidote tohypnotically produced and continued problems and limitations.REVIEW: ANCHORINGIn this work, two chapters were devoted to the subject of anchoring. Iwould like you to consider anchoring as a different way of producing"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"186Monsters & Magical Stickspost-hypnotic suggestion. Or, you may want to consider post-hypnoticsuggestion as a different way of producing anchors. I will leave that up toyou. Either way, you can have a powerful understanding of what pro-duces and continues limitations and problems.In my office, I have imitated a tone of voice or a facial expressionthat a person says upsets them; I have observed them cry, get angry and,in one case, attempt to \"punch me out.\" It was as if they were \"automa-tons,\" responding without choice or awareness. Helping them to \"col-lapse\" those anchors helped them to have choices.Since I believe that no one wants to suffer, helping them to havechoice leads them to find more satisfying and pleasurable ways of deal-ing with the world. If you are not aware of anchors (post-hypnotic sug-gestions), you run the risk of reinforcing them and triggering them.That's OK if you have a reason and a goal and intend to break the patternand collapse the painful response.Since, with hypnotic techniques such as anchoring, you can cause anindividual to respond to a pencil with anxiety or to a facial expressionwith happiness, it would seem very important for you to stop trying tomake sense out of nonsense. If logic and left-hemispheric thought couldhave resolved the problems, the problems would have been resolved.Instead, if you will consider all presenting problems as some form ofanchor or anchors produced by a form of hypnosis, your tasks will besimplified. All you will need to do is develop the techniques to help theperson respond in more useful ways. This will be accomplished byrecognizing (not analyzing) their belief system; which system (V—K—A) they need to develop; how to break the pattern; and what anchors(post-hypnotic suggestion) you need to neutralize; and what new patternsyou need to install and reinforce.Last, but not least, I do not believe that any book, even (or perhapsmoreso) this one, can replace getting in there and trying new things. Somany of us are afraid that we might make a mistake, or our patient/clientmight not like us. In truth, we're not getting paid to be liked, and ourclients don't know what is going to work and what is not. I invite you, noI implore you, to attempt what you have read and more. Each day dosomething unexpected in your practice (and your life); change chairs,change clothes, change!! Use a new technique. You will probablybecome more effective. I know it will keep you challenged, excited andhappier and, please remember, there's no such thing as hypnosis.EpilogueHypnotists: Charlatans. Evildoers. Controllers of men.Mesmer. Svengali. Rasputin. Dracula. THE DEVIL HIMSELF.Do you see him? Do you hear his silken voices telling you to do hisbidding? You know you must not look; if you do you are lost; lostforever. You cannot help yourself. You try to pull away. But his eyeslock with yours. You can hear nothing but his voice. You are helpless.And your soul is his. Forever.Or: Stage magic. Cheap entertainment. Fraud.As you sit comfortably in your seat, you watch from the safety ofdistance. The Great Fraudini, Hypnotist Extraordinaire, has his helplessvictim on stage, ready for the first humiliation. \"Bark like a dog,\" hesays, and the poor schnook gets down on all fours and barks. \"Your seatis getting hot,\" he suggests, and the fool jumps through the roof and youlaugh. \"You're naked,\" Fraudini intones and you can almost feel hisvictim's embarrassment as he tries to cover his nudity. And, suddenly,you realize that you feel uncomfortable, too.Empathy, you call it. After all, it's just a performance and the\"Victim\" is probably just going along with the gag. And, even if it isn'tjust a set-up, it must be that Fraudini picked a particularly \"suggestible\"subject—weak-minded, slow-witted and dull. Not like you, of course. Itcould never work on you.It might occur to you...NOW...that as you felt your own discomfort,Fraudini was hypnotizing you as much as his subject. Maybe you wentinto your own experience and remembered a time when you wereuncomfortable and em-bare-assed. Maybe you had a picture of that timeand heard the voice of that person and remembered.These are the symbols of hypnotism, of \"mesmerism\" as it was oncecalled. Before I met Dr. Heller I was \"hypnotised\" by these symbols. I\"knew\" what hypnosis was all about. I said to myself, \"I'm not some187"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"188Monsters & Magical Sticksbackwoods hick. I have an education. I'm knowledgeable and aware.\" SoI thought I knew what I was talking about. But symbols and cues andtriggers and anchors are powerful things.As you know by now, hypnosis, as practiced by men like MiltonErickson and Steve Heller, has nothing to do with spinning wheels andsuggestions of \"deeper and deeper.\" (While we're on the subject of\"deeper,\" Steve liked to remind us that Ph.D. is simply an abbreviationfor \"Piled Higher and Deeper.\" And he loved multiple meanings. Evenhis license plate read \"HYP PHD.\" And consider the name he gave hismethodology: \"Unconscious Restructuring®.\")Well, it's taken a long time, but finally, now, hypnosis is becomingreputable. Not just as a trick, not even just as a limited treatmentmodality for smoking or stress reduction or weight control, but as apowerful mechanism for real change. Real Change. The scientificresearch is there. Change at the level of the limbic system. (See, forexample, The Psychobiology of Mind-Body Healing: New Concepts ofTherapeutic Hypnosis by Ernest L. Rossi, Ph.D., W.W. Norton Co., Inc.,New York, 1986.) Steve's methods work. Just by \"telling stories.\"Now that you have read this book you can see clearly that it is noaccident that Dr. Steven Heller was known as The Wizard. But, maybe,you still don't believe in hypnosis. I know I didn't. And, after readingthis book, I still don't.On October 24, 1997, Steve Heller, The Wizard, left us. Though hiswork and his legacy endures, his presence, his sense of humor, and hisenormous energy are gone. As one of his many friends I miss him.Nicholas TharcherMarch 2001BibliographyAitchison, Jean.

Program of the Brain, Oxford, Oxford University Press,1978.About The AuthorSteven Heller, Ph.D., founder and director of The Heller Institute,had a clinical hypnosis practice since 1969. He was widely in demand asa lecturer and trainer of the Ericksonian method, as well as his ownmethod, Unconscious Restructuring®. Through his seminar program,Clinical Hypnosis: Innovative Techniques® Dr. Heller was one of thefirst individuals to present what was to become known as \"Ericksonianhypnotherapy.\" This program was presented throughout the country forseveral years. As a result he became known as the \"trainer of thetrainers,\" and was given the name \"The Wizard.\"In addition to his private practice, Dr. Heller trained members of thehelping professions, and conducted in-house training programs forhospital staffs, universities, medical, dental and psychologicalassociations. He was a guest on several radio and television programs.Dr. Heller utilized his methods for surgical procedures, in which generalanesthesia could not be used.
