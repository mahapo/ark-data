Happppppy Fun Bally Fun Bally Fun Bally Fun Bally Fun BallWith profuse apologies to Lewis CarrollBut not to the readerThough they may deserve itMore.The DefaceIf (and this is wildly possible) the charge of writing nonsense were ever broughtagainst the author of this brief but instructive poem, it would be based, I feelconvinced, on the line ìAnd overhead bottled mustard he tossed.îIn view of this painful possibility, I will not (as I might) appeal indignantly to myother writings at CastleChaos.Com as proof that I am incapable of such a deed. Iwill not point to the revolutionary ideas expressed and hidden within the poemitself. I will not point out the profuse footnotes that illustrate and clarify each ofthe ideas in a satisfying and robust way. I will instead explain where the linecame from and how it happened to be included within this humble poem.Prince Mu-Chao, who was deeply immersed for much of his life in the business ofweirdness and esotericism, used to eat hotdog buns on Friday, as the Petabarfcommands. Due to their plain taste, being as they were without hot dogs insidethem, the Prince would occasionally douse them with mustard and relish and eatthem thusly.One Friday, when he was reading beside a tree that was beside a stream, thePrince could not finish one of the aforementioned hot dog buns and so threw theremainder of it into the stream. Immediately, there was a commotion as fishesspawn erupted from the exact spot he had thrown the bun.Later, in the 23 Apples of Eris Re-research LaborEatery, Prince Mu-Chao andHappy Fun Ball reproduced this experiment in a goldfish bowl with Grey Poupon.Successfully, they determined that the finer the mustard they used, the moreprolific was the fishes spawn. Happy Fun Ball used the explitive, ìFnord!îwhen he saw this, and so Prince Mu-Chao logically determined that Mustardproduces fish spawn and fish spawn attracts fnords.That is where the line came from. The reason it was included in this poem wasbecause, by a strange bit of sychronicity, ìspawnî rhymes with ìPouponî. And,it attracts fnords, which (if you didnít notice) is what the poem is about.That cleared up, without further ado, I present to you The Hunting of theFNORD!111. Annotated2. We in no way imply that weknow what a FNORD! is.Nonetheless, this is the mostcomplete document on thelittle buggers you will everfind.3. ìMeowsî as you probablyalready know, are arbitrarysets of either five or twentythree.4.

This is a blatent lie designedto encourage readers to lookfor secret messages that arenot even there.8. Actually, they are more likesidenotes.9.

Did I repeat me?îBut he looked and nobody was staring.ìJust the place for a fnord!î he said with true gleeAnd thus threw a wrench in the gearing.The crew was complete: it included Chao Utter,A chaosopher few would note,MarshMellow Fluff, oh and Reverend MouthGutter ñTwo names but really one vote.Also aboard were St. Gulik and NortonBut neither was very awake.ìBobî tried to board, but Who heard a HortonAnd his brain began to flake.Lola Chaiota was also aboard(A finer lass never been known),And Fun Ball whispered to a green gourd,ìIf she wasnít here I wouldnít have shown.îThere also was one who had no nameAnd so everyone called him Joe.He thought he was Chronos a previous game,But said he may have been Poe.Jesus, the last of the crew to come board,Was himself a fairly slow learner.He had one idea ñ but that being ìfnordîHe was quickly employed as the burner.The crew was motley, the ship was gold,And the provisions were fast running out.If Mal had come, as in days of old,Theyíd have eaten him without a doubt.But now they had landed in KalamazooThe legendary home of the fnordsAnd so up on the deck gathered the crewRattling pens as mighty as swords.The pens were certainly weapons of choiceAs useful as any ward.For one may cross out the beast and voice,ìBegone, you terrible fnord!î12. The spaceship in question is a largegolden starship that Prince Mu-Chao foundin a box of Cookie Crisp. It is currently theUnOfficial Vehicle of the 23 Apples of Eris.13. Remember, this is art. We in no wayimply that the members of the 23 Apples ofEris have ever done anything like this. Wewant to remind you kids that this poem wasacted out by professionals, and you shouldfeel free to try it at home. Or in EastBentley, for that matter.14. We suspect that they were not reallythere and Prince Mu-Chao brought on dollsthat looked remarkably like these two. Thereason we suspect this is because all they didthe entire trip was lie limply in the cargohold.15. Which is a very good thing, since ourfunds were limited and we could not haveafforded financing his church for fivemonths.16. See DisOrganizational Announcement#00001.17. Again, Mu-Chao gets it wrong. Thegourd was obviously LIME green. I would notbelieve anything the man says. In fact, Idonít even believe heís a man. Itís a lie.18. This is, of course, a reference to PrinceMu-Chaoís ardent belief that Jesus iscurrently burning in hell for his crimesagainst humanity (either that, or heíswandering the region of Thud, depending onwho is right).19. This is an allusion to a former trip the23 Apples of Eris took with Mal the Elder. Atone point, Mal had said ìEat me!î to theApples, and thinking Mal was doing a Jesusimpression, they promptly did so.20. See ìThe Wilds of Kalamazooís Li-braryî, pp 130-135; National Geographic;April 1986.21. Though this method has never to myknowledge been tested, National Geographicclaims it is the best way to dispose of a fnord.It said so right underneath the biggest pairof pendulous titties I have ever seen in myentire life (which is why I remember it).22. This is present to inform you that youare on page two.1213141516171819202122"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"3Mu-Chao himself they all praised to the skies(But were suspecting, in truth, they were lost).He quieted them down after numerous triesAnd overhead bottled mustard he tossed.Bottled mustard he tossed for legend did sayFnords attract to fishes spawnAnd thus, to induce it this very same dayThe Prince had thrown Grey Poupon.He debated throwing a bottle of HeinzBut quickly decided against itFrom the crew he was hearing murmers and whinesThey were anxiously awaiting their exit.ìWe have sailed many months, we have sailed many weeks(Fifteen weeks to the month we were bored),But never, as yet, did we glimpse a true peekAt that nasty thing known as a fnord!ìWe have sailed many weeks, we have sailed many days(Five days to a week, I allow),But a fnord upon which we might otherwise gazeWe have never beheld ñ until now!ìCome listen, you guys, while I tell you againThe five unmistakable wordsBy which you might know, wheresoever you go,The perfectly genuine fnords!The first is the TASTE ñ a little like Pez.Not cherry, nor orange, but grape.One report Iíve found even cleverly saysIts head might pop up out of shape.The second, its habit of waking up LATE;Its day begins on the next,And so I warn you not to tempt fateFor a fnord in today is quite vexed.The third is the sense of HUMOR it lacksWhen told jokes its eyes start to fogAnd never, never (or so Iíve been faxed)Try to tell it a shaggy dog.23. See the Deface for the significance of mustardand how it relates to spawning fish and fnords.24. This he would have done to add color only, foreverybody knows that ketchup does not cause fishto spawn but instead is used to make french friespalatable.25. Of course, this is a mere estimation of thenumber of weeks in a discordian month, but youget the general idea.26. It is very important for the Apples to find agenuine fnord as opposed to a faux fnord. Fauxfnords are normally good for baking, but never,never in soup. A genuine fnord is the ONLY kindof fnord you would ever want to put in your soup.27. This is, of course, in Prince Mu-Chaoísopinion. Why anyone would want to put a Pez-tasting creature in a soup is beyond me, especiallyif it tasted grape-like. Recent studies have shownthat earlier studies may have been mistaken andthe fnord may taste more like a Gobstopper thanPez, but these are unconfirmed until furtherstudies have shown that the former studies were,in fact, incorrect (or correct, as the case may be).28. The report Prince Mu-Chao is referring tohere is probably the Kinsey Institute studyìFnords and Females - A Study of Inter-SpeciesCunnilingusî in which it is written:ìCunnilingus is something the fnordsseem to be natural at. Though theirtongues seem rough to the touch, manyof our female subjects requestedchecking out the fnord and bringing ithome with them for several weeks.Unfortunately, we were very limited insupply and so had to refuse. This sentseveral of the subjects into hysterics.î29. Of course, when a Discordian tells just aboutANYBODY a joke, their eyes fog, so this is notalways a good indication.30. If you donít know what a shaggy dog story is,ask around. You will eventually find somebodythat knows and they will awe you with a long andwonderfully elaborate story.2324252627282930"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"The fourth is its fondness for bubbly BATHSFor truly theyíll sometimes be foundSoaking in tubs with spongy mome rathsOutgrabbing for soap all around.The fifth is AMBITION ñ it strives to advanceTo stations beyond its own means.Some have discovered, rather by chance,That fnords see themselves to be queens.ìNow that you know the signs you should seeWhen hunting a fnord in the wild.I now will describe, under Tum Tree,The types of fnords I have filed:ìFor though common fnords can cause you much stress,The Gedub can cause more dismayÖîMu-Chao suddenly broke off his address,For MouthGutter had fainted away!00002 ñ Meow The Second ñ The MouthGutterís TaleThey roused him with beer; they roused him with mace;They roused him with pumpernickel.Before he awoke, they sprayed foam on his faceAnd put in his ass a pickle.Eventually awake and able to speakHe gave them a serious glanceThough, still scared and eyes a-leak,He stood with heroic stance.The crew was silent; he had the floor.The air with a knife you could cut.He looked at them all and said with a roar,ìWhat the hell did you put in my butt?!?!îThe crew broke out laughing; the silence was brokenThe worry was whisked away.He lit up a joint and as he was tokiníThis is what he had to say:430. Incidentally, fnords seem to perform cunni-lingus even more aptly when in a bubble bath.Due its ability to hold itís breath for hours(which, truthfully, is probably why it is so good atit in the first place), it has been known to causeover ten orgasms in one woman over a fifteenminute period while in a bubble bath.This is rivaled only by the legendary Beast ofPonuck, who reportedly secretes a scent thatimmediately causes multiple orgasms in men andwomen. Ibid, 434-437; 723.31. Mome raths are from Lewis Carrollís poemThe Jabberwocky. Carroll never explicitly statesthat they are spongy in the poem, but we know itto be the case after careful observation.Mome raths do not seem to cause orgasms inhuman beings and are therefore primarilyignored by the scientific community.32. The Tum Tum Tree, also from TheJabberwocky, is meant to be an ominous sign ofbad things coming (as it was in the Jabberwocky).Of course, the bad thing doesnít come for a longtime. Instead, the poem goes on and on and onmuch the way it has been up to this point.Therefore, in my opinion, the Tum Tum failshorribly as a foreshadowing device. As a shadow-ing device, however, many adventurers claim itperforms admirably.33. The Gedub (pronounced G. Dub) is a horren-dous creature, as many citizens of the UnitedStates are coming to find out.34. The beer they poured over his head. The macethey sprayed in his mouth, and the pumpernickelthey batted him over the head with repeatedly.35. It has been forgotten exactly what kind ofpickle it was that MouthGutter was molestedwith, but we can assume that it was very long andhard.36. Which is a very difficult thing to do with apickle in your ass.

Adult fnords are massive beings and though theyare normally not very fierce, they have been known toaccidently step on people as they were trying to runaway. Young fnords are much smaller and are rarelyseen by fnord hunters.38. Gedubs are the only type of fnord that do not growvery large. They stay fairly small, never growing tallerthan a human. What they lack in size, however, theymake up for in ferocity. They huge, sharp claws andbig, nasty teeth. One would not want to meet a fnordin a dark alley.39. We can guess that MouthGutterís father wasblowing things out of proportion with this statement. Ihave seen a Gedub and it was neither square norround, but more triangular in a spiralish sort of way.40. This has been known to happen when one staresinto the eyes of a Gedub and sees the pit of emptinessthat lies behind it. Few live to tell the tale, what withtheir brains all scattered all about and such.41. The Prince has a tendency to sometimes get quiteconfused and mix up his name. He really isnít all thatbright. Iím sure that the only reason you are evenreading this file is for my witty and pointed annota-tions.42. Gedubs cannot seem to get their tongues aroundseveral multi-syllable words such as ìcertainî,ìdecisionî, and ìneverî. Scientists say this is becausethe half of the Gedub brain that is supposed to becontrolling speech is mysteriously missing.373839404142"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"ìHe was quite dense - incapable of craft,A puppet in anyoneís hand.Not only dense but plainly quite daftIím surprised he even could stand.ìWhat I was saying before he fell faintWas merely the Gedub was strongAnd makes a regular fnord look quite quaintLike comparing Doom to Pong.ìBut these things he speaks are just not trueRegardless of what he suggests.The gedub is merely more mighty, my crew,Then a fnord ñ no more, no less.ìSo fear not,î Mu-Chao yelled and moved to the hatch,ìAnd get your butts moving right!For soon it will be too light to catchANY fnord until next night!îThe crew looked askance from Mu-Chao to Mouth,Knew where its bread was butteredAnd parked the spaceship a bit to the south,Demagnitized, unwinged and deruttered.Standing on land at the edge of the jungle,They grew faint of heart and of hindA leaderly speech he just could not bungleCame floating from Mu-Chaoís mind.ìWe WILL catch a fnord, this I say.Though I risk sounding like AhabBut it IS a fnord we will nab todayWhether it be gedub or gibgab!ìI didnít come all this way to be balkedBy a crazy man and crew.This is a fact: thereís no turning backëCause I threw a monkey wrench in the gearing.îThe crew looked confused, and wondered just whyWhat Mu-Chao said suddenly didnít make sense.Then they realizedTheir thoughts werenít making sense now either.643. Fnords are usually nocturnal creatures whohate the sun. The only time they will be caughtdead in the daylight is if they sleep so late theybecome hopelessly confused about what day theyare living in and freeze up, pondering the riddle.44. They disassembled and disabled their vehiclethis way because Kalamazoo is what we wouldcall a ìbad neighborhoodî. If they didnít lock uptightly, the starshipís radio and hubcaps wouldprobably be gone the next morning.45. Some of you smartasses who think you knoweverything are scoffing at the idea of a jungle inMichigan. Well, you should, since there ARE nojungles in Michigan. There are jungles, however,on Siriusí fifth planet, where the brave membersof the 23 Apples of Eris are searching for a fnord.The name of the entire planet is, of course,Kalamazoo. It is not named after the city ofKalamazoo in Michigan, but is instead the waySirians pronounce ìkazooî. One of the originalexplorers of the world had brought one with herand the Sirians were fascinated by it. In fact, the23 Apples of Eris had brought a box full of kazooswith them in case they ran into Sirians. Unfortu-nately, they did not and so the kazoos are notmentioned in the poem.46. The air on Kalamazoo is is filled with achemical named ìVenkagenî that enhancestelepathy to an almost alarming degree. Onearth, the Prince would be unable to send themessage that follows to his crewís minds.47. Many people have told me that they thoughtthe Prince was making a reference to Moby Dickin this line. They are shallow, dull people.Anyone who has a thought that simplistic shouldbe shot on sight. No, the Prince was speaking of aminor character in the famous novel RarnabyBudge by Charles Dikkins, the well-known Dutchauthor.48. The gibgab is not mentioned again through-out this poem and I have never seen anotherreference to it in all of my considerable studyabout fnords and fnord-like creatures. I have asneaking suspicion that Prince Mu-Chao made itup, failing to find another good rhyme with Ahab,and refusing to take the Dikkins reference out.434445464748"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Something had happened, vicious and nasty,To the world in which they lived.Their equilibrium seemed offAnd they didnít know what to do.00003 ñ Meow The Third ñ The HuntJust as sudden, it all seemed right!Reality back to normal.Reality normal?

I have no clue why he did this. It is tasteless andonly faintly amusing to those people who like self-reference in their works of fiction. I canít say that I dothat much, especially not when it is written by atalentless hack such as Prince Mu-Chao.50. These items that Prince Mu-Chao is encouragingthem to seek the fnords with are actually not materialitems. This verse is the true genius (and, quite frankly,the only genius) in this poem. If this verse is takenmetaphorically and then turned upside down threetimes, it should be obvious that Prince Mu-Chao istalking about Kaos Majix and in this verse reveals themethod to subjectively transform a 24 hour day into a48 hour day for the caster.

Though it may be hard to imagine, Kalamazooactually does have woods near a jungle. Alsonearby is a desert and an ocean. Go figure.55.

Mu-Chao was stretching the truth here.There have, strangely, been very few studies onfnords and fnordits. Besides the previouslymentioned research by the Kinsey Institute andNational Geographic, the only other references inscientific journals I could find that referencedfnords were what appeared to be a misspelledappearance of the word ìeggsî in ìQuantumMechanics and Youî by Dr. John Ron Gomeo, andan essay entitled ìNortonís Fnordî in ScienceMagazine which postulated a thought experimentthat suggested that if a fnord was in a box andeveryone looked at it, their heads would explode.57. Prince Mu-Chao may sometimes seem to doalot, but he is really very lazy.58. Thatís me. Iím always hard on him.59. If you remember, one of the words by whichyou would know a genuine fnord was BATH.60. Not only lazy, Prince Mu-Chao is a bit of awimp, too.61. An interbred fnord is pretty much useless insoup, for instead of tasting like grape Pez, ittastes more like chicken.62.

For my craft,He said, ìIs fnording off fnords on an Isle!îThe crew gave a cheer; success after all!They had captured for Eris a fnord cubThe Koop waved them down and said with a drawlìNot only a fnord, but a Gedub!îThere was quiet a moment as this was digestedAnd shortly there was a loud crashFor though last time he was thoroughly molestedMouthGutter passed out in a flash!They roused him with beer; they roused him with mace;They roused him with pumpernickel.Before he awoke, they again foamed his faceAnd put in his ass a pickle.When he awoke they were all in good cheerA party like none had seenThe ship was off course, but there was no fear(For they were busy being obscene.)MouthGutter righted the ship on courseWith that mountain where Eris wasAnd as they got closer to Chaosí forceTheir pineals started to buzz.They landed outside a palace quite grandThe finest upon which they gazedThey realized as their feet touched landThey were done and so felt dazed.They walked to the door in twos and in threesEnjoying the in-joke of allThey rang on the bell and basked in the breezeAs they waited for Goddess in thrallShe opened the door, resplendent in goldOn her face was plastered a grinShe was certainly a beautiful sight to beholdAs she bid them all to come in.1178. Jub Jubs do not have tails.79. The Koop could tell this because Koopianlegend had it that a Gedubís tail had a ring aroundit, whereas a fnord cubís tail had spots.80. The obscenities practised by the 23 Apples ofEris over the years could probably fill an oversizedbedroom reader. I believe Chao Utter is working onactually writing one. Itís working title isìTrySexuality!î and is forcasted to be finishedwhenever he takes enough time out of slobberingover the wet, naked bodies of other members. Ihave currently locked him in our dungeon until Iam finished annotating this. If I hadnít, I probablywould never get this done. The man is insane.81. As those of you who have visited Eris at Herpalace are well aware, when you approach Mt.Olympus your Pineal Gland reaches out and seeksErisí for a mutal caress. This causes a faint buzzingsound to eminate from your head.82. With no other religion on earth are in-jokes asrevered as with that of Our Lady Eris.7879808182"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"00005 ñ Meow The Fifth ñ ErisìMy Goddess, Discordia, weíve got your fnord,îMu-Chao said as he entered the palaceItís alive and well, and somewhat boredAnd probably filled with great malice.îìThank you all so, I will treasure your giftFor a soup with no fnord is quite rottenYou have spent a great many days adriftHow many of them have you gotten?îìJust one, my lady,î Prince Mu-Chao replied,ìBut a fat one; we can always go back.Look at the beautiful colors!î he cried,And without thinking he dumped out the sack.Fixed to the spot, her head did explodeAnd sent matter flying through air.Pieces flew about her abodeAnd some stuck in Mu-Chaoís hair.They all turned to Mu-Chao; All eyes were on him;Both those of his crew and the KoopsThey were all shocked, incredulous and grim,But what could the Prince say but, ìOops!î?The End127878. Prince Mu-Chao is not known for his foresight.79. This is true. He really did say that.80. Of course, being a goddess, Eris did not die butinstead (after several sessions of physical therapy) wasback to her old self again in just a few weeks. Hergreatest pleasure during the years following this storywas to harass Prince Mu-Chao incessantly, and severalof these Episodes are related in Liber 3167, which mayor may not be located somewhere uponCastleChaos.Com.7980  Published by Castle Chaos  http://www.CastleChaos.Com  K - All Rights Reversed, Reprint What You Like"}]
