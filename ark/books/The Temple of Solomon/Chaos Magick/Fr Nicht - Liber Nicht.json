It can be argued that if this were true than everything we do would be an act of magick. An act of getting out of bed or turning on your TV. Would be magic. Meeting a woman at a bar and selling yourself to her to get her clothes off would be magical too. No matter what you do, it is a magical event if it is something that you yourself willed to action. Doesn’t matter how simple or complex, it is an act of magick. "},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":" 4I have argued this point many times and I’m sticking to it. It doesn’t always need to be about pulling out the altar and props or shouting out an invocation. There is so much more to it, yet it all becomes much simpler. Every conscious act is magical including the act of reading this book. There are three basic types of magic which can be utilized to achieve your will which are Low Magic, Sorcery, and High Magic. Low Magic – This kind of magical practice one may find themselves to be pretty good at prior to learning the definition for it. If you understand what makes a man crazy for you when you wear something and you intentionally wear it again and again to attract men’s glances, you are using a form of Lesser Black Magic. In a way you are invoking a result using your will to manipulate the objective universe by mind and personal talent. Sorcery – Mundane Black Magic – Any ritual working used to send your Self’s intent into the future. This can range from being as simple a working as chanting a lover’s name over and over above a lit candle. It can be as complex as an all night long ceremonial sex magic rite. High Magic – Possession (invocation) or evocation of dark deities and daemons would fall under this category. 1) Possession – This where you willingly allow yourself to be inhabited by a daemon or god of your choosing. One should be clear of their intent when such an act is performed. Set the ground rules of how you plan to interact with the entity. It doesn’t matter if it is a creation of your own mind, because if you can convince yourSelf that it is real, it will be real enough. 1) Evocation – Calling on a deity of choice for insight or information. (Make a quick note of “to you” as opposed to “into you”. This can be compared to Moses and the Burning Bush or to Crowley and the visit from Choronzon. Some LHP magicians consider Possession to be a Cardinal Sin. Taking in anything that distorts your perception and interferes with your clear Will and thought could equal surrendering to something beyond or beneath you. I feel one that is powerful with confidence has the power to allow the Possession to run it’s full course even if it allows him/her to “not quite be themselves.” Try invoking Babalon before having great sex with a lover. I dare you. I know I am only scratching the surface here, but trust me, we will dig a bit deeper later."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":" 5 Become good at any one of these single forms of technique and you will certainly rise up to a new level of confidence and personal power. Master all of them and people will begin to notice you when you want to be noticed. Because when you go into a meeting for your job or in public to strut your stuff, you already know what the people want to see, and you dress the part. (This is utilizing your talents with Low Magic.) Cast a Sorcery Spell by creating a Servitor (daemon slave) to visit those you wish to compel, whispering your name and desires into their ears. Follow up with a meditation, the night prior to the meeting, seeing yourself walking through those you wish to enchant and over those that try to stand in your way. (High Magic) If you believe in a deity already does magic work? Yes If you don’t believe in anything but yourSelf does magic work? Yes If you believe in one deity but choose to call on another one that you made up... does magic work? Yes You say prove it? I say, prove me wrong. Magic has been useful for as long as man (or woman) has wandered the earth. Since the earliest days, when cave men painted their kill on the walls of their caves to assure a catch from a hunt, man has been wired to make a connection to the other side. Many different traditions on all corners of the world think they have the right formula, trying to crack the codes of the gods. Many of them choose to answer to these gods. Others like to tell their gods they call, to do their bidding. All the diversities have proven, with equal success, that magic works, or is, at least, believed to work. Whether through an act of Prayer or by the angst fueled Will of a Satanist, we are all tapping into something beyond complete human understanding or perception. How magic works, will certainly be figured out by science one day, (if we don’t destroy ourselves first) but that will take the fun out of it all. There is mystery to be unearthed if one is willing to take on the challenge. Be a roadside shaman if you choose to, or a no smoke, no drink professional. This is your life to be what you wish you can be. Liber Nicht is dedicated to those who choose to walk on what is often called Left Hand Path, and the magic within is intended for that purpose as well. It is just a collection of notes that I have pulled from my personal book of results. The ideas with are my own and I am not going to sit here and say I am an expert by any means. Simply give you a chance to tinker around with my brain a bit. "},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":" 6You already know, and don’t need me to tell you that You are your own boss. Though there are certain mundane world rules you must abide by, it is up to you how you plan to take on the next few years to come. Yes, you have to go to work, punch a time clock, and blend in with the sleepers during the day. But they can’t see the Self behind your eyes. Or hear it speaking to within, telling you that you are gonna have their job someday. Magic does work, but the secret of multiple success is applying all the best magics into one simplified system, to achieve your goal. Don’t just sit on the computer all day sending instant messages to all your “friends” that you may never meet in person. Or cast a love spell and then rot on the couch waiting for your future lover to make his or her grand entrance. Go out into the world, into the night, and be seen, meet the people around you. Because they may be the one’s trying to blend in like you, which you have been looking for all these years. If you are pretty. Don’t be afraid to show it. If you have long legs, sport them. If your stomach has a pouch, ear some fancy shoes. If your standards are set to high... Try anyway. If your expectations are set too low... Raise them Living on the LHP Once you come to realize that you are a god and that you truly are the only force that can change your course in life, you understand that, yes, \"If it be MY will, it shall be done!\" No prayers to a higher source are going to bring anything. (Unless directed towards the Self within.) You have to activate a part of your being into taking action, and making your desires become real. Of course there are coincidences that happen all around us all the time that are mislabeled as miracles. Don't be deceived into thinking that a god made it happen for you. I believe it is just a random act or magick brought about by your Will. There was a time in my life when I was afraid to admit that I really was separate from the rest of the world. That I was the navigator of this vehicle called a body, and all those feelings, ideas, and dreams that filled it with substance, made me who I am. "},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":" 7I was raised a God fearing Christian, and for a long time, after deciding to reclaim my life and own identity, I found myself feeling waves of guilt and fear that God was watching me break his commandments and would punish me for all of those unclean thoughts. But after years of desensitizing myself, I learned to quiet that voice that was the product of a lifetime of church going hog wash, and hear my true inner voice that was drowned out and just a faint whisper. This is what I call my personal Break Through. You may find yourself crying with tears of joy, and fall completely in love with the person that has been with you all these years and never actually had a chance to meet you. ( You...) For this reason alone, I have found my journey on the LHP to be so satisfying. Yes, this road is not an easy one to tread. And no one will say that the Prince of Darkness is there to protect us from the hardships of life. He's not. Tough times are there, no matter which course you take, but you can complete your journey of life knowing that that choices you made where your own and belong only to YOU. No one will ever be able to take that feeling away from you. And that is the true source of the LHP. ( I believe). Here are a few steps I took to get the ball rolling - (Try 'em) : 1) Train yourself not to fear death, but embrace it... then let it go. So many people I knew spend a huge portion of their lives living in fear of the unknown. Worrying how they might come to meet their death. After witnessing a fatal car accident when I was younger, I spent the next couple years afraid to even get into a vehicle. Until I realized how much of my time was being wasted on something I could not go back and change or prevent. I promised myself from that day forward, that I would do everything within my power to try not to let that happen to me, but that if it was going to happen, I would worry about it at that time, but not until then. It was like a weight was lifted off of me! (The LHP is a celebration of your life! Death will find you soon enough. Make sure when it does come, and your life flashes before your eyes, it is filled with things that make you feel alive, even in death.) 2) Be your own person. The world was (and still is) deteriorating all around me, and it can become too easy to just become lethargic and give in. If I let the advertising that"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":" 8bombards me on the TV, radio, Internet get to me, I may find myself spending all you have earned to reach consumer gratified, artificial Victories. I look at the things I wear. Did I buy that sweater because everyone else wears it? Even though I know I would feel more comfortable wearing leather? What about the shows I watch on TV? Do I really enjoy what I are feeding my mind, or is this just another bad habit that has formed over the years? Can I miss one of \"this seasons new shows\", or will it throw my week off? (Try discovering a new talent buried within you! Write a poem, or play the guitar. Go out and show the world just how cool you really are by meeting other people. Find someone to love.) 3.) Experiment with Magic! If you have experience and knowledge with utilizing magick, use it. Don't just read a stack of books on the subject. You have to apply what you learn to see that it really does work. Unfortunately, you will find that there are many books out there that don't teach you much of anything except what not to do. They spend a good portion of the time explaining to you the laws of karma and the dangers of using everything they teach you. These books usually suck, but if you pay for one accidentally, you owe it to yourself to at least read through it to hopefully pull something out of it that you \"want\" or \"need\". If it is so bad that you can't do this, look at it as funny reading and make a mental note not to fall for that crap in the future. Dive in and find out about the uses of black magick for yourself. Yes, of course you will make mistakes. (Like in anything else that you do.) But you'll get better at it as you go along. Learn the mysteries of the darkness within. As you grow and unlock the person on the inside, remember that this journey is yours, and that it belongs to you. People will notice that you have more confidence and an appetite for life, which they may lack. But as you advance and initiate yourself along the way, you’ll be able to decide when and if they are ready to see that secret side of you, which has always been there. 999 In Stephen Flowers book called Lords of the Left Hand Path, he covers almost the entire magical history of LHP religions. I suggest anyone that"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":" 9truly plans to explore the dark path read it. If for no other reason then to understand the two main definitions describing it. Deification of the Self – “attainment of an enlightened (or awakened), independently existing intellect and it’s relative immortality...” Antinomianism – “going against the grain.’ Of their culturally conditioned and conventional norms of ‘good’ and ‘evil’.” I say, regarding chaos magic, “ I use chaos – I am not the chaos.” Thanks to Osirian times in Egypt, mankind has been, for the most part, under the assumption that God = Master and that People = (God’s) Servants. As a chaos magician there are no rules. You can call on gods that demand your devotion until you get the results that you need and then discard him or her for another one that is appropriate for the focus of your next step in your personal work. Or you can choose to emulate a being like Satan for example that symbolizes self-satisfaction and perfection to break away from the herd. Perhaps work with no god at all. Instead choosing to create servitors to do your bidding, existing as your own god. As a chaos magician experimenting with the Western Left Hand Path belief model, it is important to remember that you are what this journey is all about. Do you need an Osirian style Guardian angel? That expects and desires that you treat it with worship and offerings? No, your god is a reflection of your self. Exists within the chaos and can be seen as the “Dark One. He is known throughout history as the adversary. Today he is seen as the one that looks out for one’s Self.

All was formless, without energy, and still. 1:2 Alone, this vast limitless mass sat within itself, since Not was all that was. 1:3 No star, no worlds, no thought, for all of these, would mean separate, not one. And one it was. 1:4 Perfectly balanced and equal. Since all parts were composed not, all parts were one. All where the same. 1:5 And the day began. Formed itself from darkness. The void without reason or intention allowed All to be born. 1:6 One hundred thousand millenniums once went unchanged, yet blossomed into a random, uncalculated motion.

Infinite in possibilities, it invented it's own new identity and multiple realities. 1:10 The Chaos spiraled into motion, and indiscriminately formed galaxies and worlds to it's own taste, sending the wheels of creation into motion, for the thrill of discovery and self gratification. 1:11 This marked the first of many miracles to materialize needlessly, yet for it's own pleasure, effortlessly. 1:12 The great universe was filled with intricate shards of this marvelous event. 1:13 The first and certainly not the last great metamorphosis inspired many new dimensions never before alive, until the great spark of destruction devoured lifelessness. 1:14 Next there was life. Created by energy. Conscious, as well as unconscious vitality, spawning it's own offspring, scattered across the sacred Void. 1:15 Ignorant to it's own origin, life created life and discovered death. Chaos Magic (Over) simplified Chaos Magic is a tool or technology, which allows the magician to get, required results, by simplification of the process. Intended to be a magical system that could stand on it’s own with no needed belief model. Chaos Magic does not mean that your life should be out of control and without meaning or direction. What has been lacking in the practice of chaos manipulation that the idea of being separate to the nature of the universe and your own keeper makes for a much more fulfilling existence. Simply because you are calling all the shots and not some eye in the sky, that’s “making a list and checking it twice...” The motto “Nothing True / Everything Permitted” leaves a door way open. Sure, you can be a magician that digs through trashcans for your food or you can be one sporting a new Lexus. One has to remind themselves that while the laws of the universe means that hard times may come your way. You can shrug them off and blame it on the planet alignments (which I am guilty of from time to time.) or you can enjoy life for the ride, and take the good with the bad. Always come out fighting. Life is worth fighting for. It is a system of Shamanism, since most of the techniques and their results come about by experimentation.

"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":" 14LHP Chaos Magick As a Wizard, wanting to use chaos magick as a technology instead of a belief model, one should use the criteria described by Stephan Flowers in Lords of the Left Hand Path. According to him, there are two things that separate us, as well as our work from the right hand path in all our labors. See below : • “Self-Deification” - An individual awaking of the self and existence separate from the collective universe on one's own terms. According to the accepted chaos paradigm, we are all part of the random collective. From the LHP perspective, and using one of the myths of Set, who slayed Apep (chaos), we are in fact an isolate intelligence, which exists separate from the chaos of the objective universe and can in fact manipulate the infinite possibilities of chaos, rather than surrender to them. • “Antinomianism” - Going against the grain or laws of a system or belief structure. By not accepting all that is presented by the originators of the chaos magick technologies and philosophies, we are using it according to our individual needs. I for one, have found much use for the ideas explained within the book Liber Null and the Psychonaut. Like the Satanic Bible, for the Satanist, it is a great place to start, but over the years, one will find that it is quite incomplete and only scratches the surface of what can be accomplished from the use chaos magick from a LHP perspective. For instance, the Liberation and Random Belief exercises are useful for the beginner magician that has not yet fully discovered the god within. In theory, one could expect that by forcing feeding random experience upon oneself could in fact jump start one's Breakthroughs, by desensitizing or reprogramming their dislikes into a pool of bland appreciation for things that never excited or even repulsed them before the experiment. To me this is nothing more that surrendering to the unconscious chaos collective. Carroll's take on Augoeides, is based loosely on Crowley's description of the search for the Holy Guardian Angel. Again, this is another RHP process, which the Great Beast obsessed on until his very death. For the LHP chaos practitioner, I agree with the idea that \"a person doing his true will is assisted by the momentum of the universe\". However, Praying to a higher source for direction or assistance does not float with me. As a deity of the LHP, magick creates the opportunities as well as apparent coincidences from the fabric of the subjective universe, altering the future objective universe. In some cases, this can be considered \"open handed\" magick, by projecting your will into reality by concentration alone. Chaos magick, yes, but from a LHP perspective. "},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":" 15Transmogrification is defined by Carroll as the \" metamorphosis to black magical consciousness\". From the LHP perspective, I see though that instead of \"abandoning comfort, conventionality, security, and safety\", one should instead strive for these. While these things are arbitrary forms of \"order\", I see no reason why they should not be desired or pursued by the chaos magician. Of course there may be times in a magician's life when the world that you have come to love and become comfortable residing in crumbles in around you. But surrendering to chaos for the sake of avoiding such catastrophes is in direct opposition to the philosophy of the LHP and is more of a cop out and therefore defeats the purpose of Self Perfection and the quest for Breakthroughs. Abandoning patterns of residence, employment, relationships and taste is simply surrendering to the forces of the universe that a Satanist chooses to master. The Alphabet of Desire is of use to the Luciferic person when used as a tool for understanding the duality of emotions / desires. Or when charging with Neither /Neither. If it is the desire of a magician to replace a bad habit or overwhelming emotion that inhibits your personal growth, this section of Liber Null can be very useful when applied to mundane experiences as well as ritual magick work. The LHP mage knows that some emotions are the nectar of life and should not be destroyed unless they hinder the growth of the magician. Liber Null describes the chaosphere as the \"prime radiant lamp of the adept - a psychic singularity which emitteth the brilliant darkness\". The chaosphere is a most mysterious and magical symbol. I apply it to my work as a Satanist as a symbol of infinite possibilities in my life. It is older than the pentagram and according to Nicholas Hall in Chaos and Sorcery, it is the oldest known magical sigil, found dating back as far as 3000 BC. It pulsates with the secrets of the origin of the universe as well as our future potential as super gods wielding the powers of it's mystery chaos as Set did in breaking Apep in the ancient myths of Egypt. But, as a side note, in infractioning himself from the snake of disorder, he created an existence of his own, according to his own taste and needs. While doing this, one should NOT see the action as simply Set separating himself from chaos entirely. According to history, he was known as the god of chaos, war, and storms. I can feel it seeping beneath the surface of even the hardest surface that cannot be shattered. Like the monolith in 2001 that appeared as a perfectly symmetrical obelisk from afar, chaos resided within it as well.

Forcing one's primal survival reactions can not only enhance a working, but can encompass it as a whole. Shamans of the ancient ages used this sort of technique during certain rites. It is know that, initiates were dragged kicking and screaming to the secret place of the working, where they were thrown into an open grave and left to face their personal demons through the night. After such experiences, the initiate is never the same. He has opened perspectives never before explored. Upon being realized, he is essentially being reborn into this world, which is now, more within his grasp and control as a recognized warrior or adept of the tribe. If you have ever been in a situation when you have narrowly escaped death. You could not have walked away without coming through it better or stronger than you were before it happened. For me, an example of this was a time, several years ago, while riding my motorcycle through the streets of Hollywood Kali-fornia. It was dark, so I did not see the oil puddle on the exit curve as I merged. Miraculously, I landed on my feet, and managed to stay upright, in a run, next to it, watching it spew sparks and flip a couple of times ahead of me. (It is funny now, having survived with only a scratch on my elbow, which I actually received while tripping as I walked away from the wreckage.) My adrenaline was pumping and I experienced an extreme sense of clarity, unlike I had ever felt before. All of the problems in my life that seemed insurmountable suddenly seemed like tiny anthills. The next day, while running the experience through my mind, I felt a realization come over me. That the crash could have easily been the last moment of my existence. I had to evaluate if I had done all I wanted with this life. Was I where I wanted to be? I told myself at that moment that I would make every desire I had a reality. Suddenly, almost over night, all of the obstacles and insecurities that held me back from my Will, fell away and made me see how accessible my wants and needs really were.

While our bodies are made up of \"universe stuff\", that voice inside our head, which is known as the Self, is separate. I believe this is what sets us apart from the rest of earth wildlife and the sleep walking zombies. Once men started making choices that no longer existed in the scheme of nature, or against the grain of the people around them, that they had in fact embraced a satanic consciousness. No one can deny that some of our race does appear to be sleeping. They refuse to see who or what they really are or care to seek. This is not something that is measured by your I.Q. There are many very intelligent people that walk like pigs to a slaughter, forming a single file line behind their leaders, unable to grasp the possibility that they control their own fate... if they would only just snap out of it.

See your astral body, which looks like you on your best day, naked or in desirable dress. You step out of your body and walk into the ebon of your subjective mind. Touching a landscape of different shades of gray and black. Once you make contact with this Being that exists outside of you. You should try and communicate your feelings and desires to it. If you don’t feel it is with you, fake it. What is important is that you go through the motions intending to make contact and communicating with it. Is the Dark One a reflection of the astral self or a Daemon that is symbolic of your strengths and potentiality? Is it both? What really matters is that you try to see the correlation of the conscious being that, whether is real or isn’t, can exist on it’s own Will and wisdom. I see him as a voice to my future. Transmits tips back at me, and when I send a version of my astral self into it’s vortex and imagine him walking back to me wiser, more attractive, and stronger. This is a good exercise for reminding me just how unique I really am. How unique we all are. The Pentagram set inside the chaosphere is symbolic of this. You are an Independent Being existing separate from the rhythms of your town or city. As a Left Hand Path being, you owe it to yourSelf to do whatever you have to, to make every day count.

Chaos magic can entice one to loose their footing and slip headfirst into a reality that contains very little Reality. Delusion and stasis can be the effect of any belief model if you forget the Self. Choose the level of success you want to achieve and then do it. Visualize your potential self or deity that represents the Self as the Dark One. Project it back into yourself. Charge sigils and fire them off. The Dark One has spoken to people throughout history using a wide variety of religions using different names. If you feel that you connect deeply with a particular god or spirit, you should explore it more deeply. Don’t be afraid to dig up the attributes and use them in your personal initiation. Just remember that they should only be used as a model or ally. The moment you begin to worship the deity or believing it is meddling with your destiny in the typical Yahweh fashion, you have allowed yourself to slip into the Right Hand Path trap.

There is no secret.” Fra Nicht 888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888 “Wise man once say nothing.” Fra Nicht Austin Spare - The Kia “Of name it has no name, to designate. I call it Kia I dare not claim it as myself. The Kia which can be expressed by conceivable ideas, is not the eternal Kia, which burns up all belief but is the archetype of \"self,\" the slavery of mortality. “ Spare For our purposes, she/he is the Dark One,. She/he must be engaged with through the subjective universe... however, we are free to assume the “Dark One” exists somewhere in the Objective universe, if we want to. Like the ape-men in 2001 – A Space Oddessy, the Dark One is who touched us and ignited the conscious essence within us. Is she/he the Self or a projection of the potential Self? Only you should quest to answer this. And you are likely to change your mind or position on this throughout the fleshy life ahead of you. Some say the Kia is made up of many selves, others believe there is one. “The Kia which can be vaguely expressed in words is the \"Neither-Neither,\" the unmodified \"I\" in the sensation of omnipresence, the illumination symbolically transcribed in the sacred alphabet, and of which I am about to write. Its emanation is its own intensity, but not necessariness, it has and ever will exist, the virgin quantum-by its exuberance we have gained existence.” Spare To him we were all somehow connected in some way by the chaos collective. In it’s purest form it swims thoughtless and unmoved by emotion or desire.

The \"I\" principle has reached the \"Does not matter- need not be\" state, and is not related to form. Save and beyond it, there is no other, therefore it alone is complete and eternal. Indestructible, it has power to destroy- therefore it alone is true freedom and existence. Through it comes immunity from all sorrow, therefore the spirit is ecstasy. Renouncing everything by the means shown, take shelter in it. Surely it is the abode of Kia? This having once been (even Symbolically) reached, is our unconditional release from duality and time- believe this to be true. The belief free from all ideas but pleasure, the Karma through law (displeasure) speedily exhausts itself. In that moment beyond time, a new law can become incarnate, without the payment of sorrow, every wish gratified, he* having become the gratifier by his law. The new law shall be the arcana of the mystic unbalanced \"Does not matter- need not be,\" there is no necessitation, \"please yourself\" is its creed.” Spare Charging a sigil can be done in many ways. But when charging and then releasing it into your subconscious mind, Spare is suggesting that you achieve a state of “vacuity” of the mind. This can be done using what is one of many techniques. These include but are not limited to dancing into a state of exhaustion, marathon fucking with orgasm sigil charge, whipping someone into deep gnosis, prolonged motionlessness staring at the mantra until it burns itself into your mind. In Ray Sherwin’s Book of Results, he suggested when making a sigil to charge and launch, that one should use opposite positive / negative colors. Example - Black on a white background. Or opposite colors painted onto a canvas or cardboard. He explains that in order to find a color’s negative is pretty simple. Just stare at the bright color for as long as you can. Then close your eyes. The color that you see in reverse lids the opposite color. But in truth, it’s up to you how you do it.

For the most part, there is no reason why you can’t enjoy life in any way you wish to. So long as you do not feel as though you are doing something that is not helpful or detrimental to your own personal initiation, feel free to become your deepest desire. If you have always wanted to recreate yourself and become a totally different person, and relocate, leaving the rest of the world behind... or if you think your current existence is more a product of media programming and expectations of a sleeping world that you have been catering to.. or if you are where you want to be, but need to add some fun, “Do what thou Wilt...” If you have found a place in your life where you are comfortable, don’t be afraid to enjoy the ride. Soak up the good days and times when they make their way to you. But don’t get lost in the melancholy.

Resting your mind and your body is necessary for your mind to be at its peak and your body to be put to best serve you. Doing so with sleep is good for your vessel (body) and allows your Will to be done more efficiently, at the very least in the physical world. This should be performed in an upright sitting position, either in a chair or on the floor. Outside in your back yard is great too, if you are lucky enough these days to have one. If the night is warm enough. FIRST – Sit as still as possible with eyes open or closed. If the surroundings you are in please you, and make you feel at ease, take it in. If not, just close your eyes and imagine yourself light years away, in another place. Floating in space or seated in the perfect satanic temple. SECOND – The chaos orb appears above your psychic eye or all seeing eye located up and between the eyes. Demanding you attention you see it pulsating and rotating mindlessly, with a neon purple glow. Its eight rays dance around it’s exterior, reminding you of it’s innumerable possibilities. THIRD – It has form because you give it form. It has no mind but yours controls it. It is the force that launches your spells but requires your Will. Try and understand the wisdom in the silence that words cannot explain. FOURTH – Or just sit there and think about how separate you are from those things that interfere with your initiation. Try and remember the way this place feels.

I believe that strong is a man that believes nothing until it is thoroughly proven by himself to himSelf. But through trial and error, one must form certain beliefs after decoding the to the Self. Not many people can see things beyond the tunnel vision of a group’s purpose or their own stale, blind, straight-ahead perspective.

What is important is that you be able to create your own form of each. If you find that it works, stick to it. There will be times when you want to perform an act of sorcery, and will want to just get to the matter and move on. Most writers will tell you to keep a “book of results” or “book of shadows” to record your every magical act, both mundane and supernatural. I suggest instead to keep a book of your spells you perform only. Create a spell recipe book, consisting of the rituals that work. The ones that don’t should be pulled out, thrown away or re-filed somewhere else. I am including my own version of each type, which can be used as an outline for spells you wish to perform. Just replace your desires and deities to fit the purpose of your working."},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":" 26 Sigil Basics Frater UD put out a really good book on this subject called Practical Sigil Magic. One can spend a lifetime creating new magical designs to launch into your subconscious, but it won’t take an entire book to describe this technique to you. Simply put, you take a written statement of intent and rearranging them to make a symbol or mantra that doesn’t mean anything to your conscious mind but will be remembered during a state of gnosis or Neither / Neither. There are two really fun parts to chaos magic. Creating the sigil can be a work of art in itself. And then charging it can be as painful or thrilling experience as you Will it to be. The key to chaos magic is not to lust for results. This is something Spare realized and can be understood more clearly by reading his Book of Pleasure. It is a good idea to hide the sigil from your eyes after the working or destroying it. Wait and see. Once you become indifferent to the results, your wish will come to be. Patience is the key too. Your spell may not make it’s way to you immediately. In fact, some results can take up to a year or more, depending on the desire. Some rituals can be an ongoing experiment in planning a goal for a year from now. Create servitors and spells that are to be charged in order, one at a time, until the goal is reached. There is no limit to what one can do. All Purpose - Servitor Spell Creating a servitor can be an excellent tool for the LHP magician. I will say right up front that they can be very helpful to do your bidding and carry out tasks for you... But like a pet, you must never forget that you are the master, and should be prepared to destroy it if it becomes a prankster or too powerful. Servitors are used often by chaos magicians who, often, like to have several running their duties, all at the same time. I have found that more than three to be very distracting and usually unnecessary. (Peter Carroll recommends having no more than four.) Servitors can be created almost any way you can think of. They can be conjured from an image on paper. Evoked from a clay or plaster likeness."},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":" 27(These can be mixed with hair, nails, or sexual fluids to charge them. Use yours for protection spells and the enemies for specified curses) A few examples of how someone would use a servitor are as follows: 1) To guard your home. 2) To speak to beautiful women in their sleep and guide them to you. 3) Hunt down someone that crosses you to deliver revenge. (Great for making motorcycles tip or piano to fall at the right time.) 4) Draw people of like minds to you to join your group. 5) Etc... This form of evocation can also be called enchantment, where evoked entities are made to create effects on behalf of the magician. If there is something you fear that interferes with your Breakthoughs. Whatever it is... you just send out your little “nasties” to remove the obstacle from your path. Example of Servitor Evocation: Create a name for your servitor by first writing out your will. For a protection spell, you could say “Protect M e”. Then mix the letters up to create a nonsense word to name it... You could name him Trompect. Write it on a piece of wood. (Or something that can be broken or burned.) Your servitor can usually be tamed by addressing them. If they bother you or have outlived their usefulness, they should be destroyed. Light a candle to symbolize the black flame, along with tons of powdered incense. While evoking look from time to time into the smoke and you should see it manifest prior to charging the fetish. Repeat “eeeey – ewwww” nine times. The deeper the resonance the better. Fell it vibrate within your chest. Hold the sigil over the flame and let its backside brown slightly. Do not let it burn. Speak these words: “Daemon, I (magical name) conjure you forth, from the soup of the universe. Come into consciousness and come unto me! I name thee (daemon name ) . In doing so, I hereby create and own you. Servitor, you will tremble at my words and do my bidding for approval and favor. Cross me (daemon name )"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":" 28and I will un-create you. I will remove you from this world. Destroy you as fast as I imagined you. Do as I wish and I will remember you, and breathe life into you again and again. If charging it with sex magick, stare into the smoke as you perform the act. Be patient, he will come. If you do not see it, just know that it is near you. Charge it with your fluids to bind it to you. (No blood please.) Set fetish near the candle. Recite its name over and over as you imagine how it will carry out your desire at the same time. See yourself as the daemon, and see how it should carry out your will. Say, “(daemon name ), carry out my will! I command you. I bind you by the fires of Inanna and the sword of Bata! You are my loyal servant. Hail the Dark One! Take a moment to think about how you will spend your time on your personal Xeper now that your servitor is off, doing the work for you. Vibrate, “ “eeeey – ewwww” several times. Put the sigil in a safe place within the space you are protecting, or carry it on you wherever you go. Do not lose it. You should see results quickly. Servitors can lose their focus from time to time, so feel free to talk to them, and remind them of their purpose. Try and meet with them in your dreams for status reports. Keep notes by your bed for interpretation along the way. 88888888888888888888888888888888 Vocal / Vibratory - Sigil of Flesh Ritual This act of Enchantment will be an operation designed to create vibratory fleshy sigils for individual desires.

Creation of verbal nuncupative sigils. 2) Charging of sigil in the ritual chamber"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":" 293) Applying sigil to the Aether. 4) Destruction of sigil after completion. The first step of this working is to realize what you desire. Since all acts of gratification contribute to one’s personal initiation, this ritual is not centered on it as a whole, but focuses on getting a cheap thrill or quick fix. Fuel for life. I suggest that the first time you use this, that you decide on something you have a remote possibility of making happen, or bringing something to you that you are able to find or draw to you from time to time. Write down your desire, beginning with the statement \"It is my will...\", to create a precise and short sentence. EXAMPLE - It is my will that I have a threesome with two strangers. Next, break down the words so that you only have the (single) letters of the sentence. EXAMPLE - ITSMYWLHAVERONG Rearrange the letters to make a 2 to 3 word statement. EXAMPLE - \" Gnist Lhaormy Vew\" Prepare your ritual chamber to signal your sub-conscience, that this is a somewhat serious act of magick. The working should be done when you are certain not to be interrupted by the TV, phone, or unexpected visitors. A suggested altar piece or ritual prop should be a black eight rayed chaosphere, since you will be charging the sigil and making it active within the great Aether. Chaos will give your wish shape, while the Kia will give it power to be fulfilled. There should be a table (altar) with your usual Pentagram of Set, along with the image of the chaosphere, just described, above the altar. Ahead of the flame should be your written out vibratory sigil of black enchantment. The candle should be your only source of light. Ring bell / gong nine times. (If you don't have one, clap your hands together instead.) Perform Gnostic Inverted Pentagram Ritual A) Draw inverted Pentagram in the air. As you do so, vibrate the vowels I,E,A,O,U, while you create and visualize each line, on fire in the air ahead of you. Rotate left and continue until you reach the same point again. EXAMPLE - Pronounced \"Eyeeee... Eeeh... Aaaah... Oohh... Ewww...\" "},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":" 30B) When back to the original position, vibrate the vowels again, holding until the entire breath is exhaled for each one. At the same time imagine a warming red glow. I = Head, E = Throat, A = Heart / Lungs, O = Stomach, U = Genitals Feel the powers of chaos swimming around you and within you. (This may cause excitement or dizziness.) At this moment, all the thoughts of the day should be forgotten, as you are one with the universe. Sit before the altar. Imagine a rotating chaosphere above you. Feel the black flame within you growing stronger and warming you within. C) Normally you would expect to take the time to say a quick statement of intent. Instead, just know that the Dark One is there with you. At this moment, you and he are one. His gift was to realize your desire, and to make it manifest. D) Speak your secret words to Set as you fill your body with the blackness that surrounds you. SAY - EXAMPLE - \" Gnist Lhaormy Vew\" Repeat it until you reach a state of gnosis, breathing in and out deeply between each declaration. Self-stimulation can be used to super charge your words. If this is done, use your sexual fluids to charge the paper with your secret on it. Fold it, and place it aside. You are done with this step, but the ritual is not to be banished or closed out. This ritual continues over the next week. You should repeat your words in the shower, while driving, falling to sleep.... (Whenever there is a silent moment.) It can be a whisper, or exclaimed in your privacy or in a loud crowded room. Even thought to yourself loudly over the sounds of traffic or TV. Know that it is working, but don't lust for results. Over the next few days, be open for opportunities. Knowing it will not fall in your lap. (It could but...) Go out to a new place to hang out. Do your shopping in the morning instead of in the evening. Look for signs of Synchronicity. Speak to those you normally would not. Open the doors of opportunity. After a week... If your desire came to be - Simply burn the paper with your sigil on it and go on with life as usual.

SO IT IS DONE. Self Initiation Creating Your Own God If you are exactly where you want to be in your life, and have been there for a long time, with no dream unfulfilled, now would be a good time to say to yourself... “Hey, what the fuck is wrong with me?” Write it down. Speak it out loud. Say to yourself, on paper what it is that keeps you from reaching your next goal in life. If you can’t come up with anything, after evaluating your life, than you have probably reached a well-needed mundane vacation. If you come back and say, “ I drink too much... I need better looking clothes... I want to beat this world and stop letting it beat me down into a cozy mundane grave.” “There’s plenty of time for sleeping when you’re dead.” A friend of mine named Chuck said this... and someone dead probably said it before him. Is there something you want that would be worth getting out of bed for? Cast spells often. As long as something within you does not feel that you are doing something contrary to what you would will, there will be no karma. Doing harm to someone in the mundane world does not apply to this rule. Reality does carry action reaction, but this and karma are two different things. In other words, “Karma is optional.” But you will do more good for your own existence on the outside, than locked up in a holding cell. Now is the time to claim your destiny. You are one of a kind, and its time people see that. Rise up and take the world Kali style. Liber MMM – Just Blink For Christ’s Sake One thing that I think is lacking in the Americanized LHP is that there is very little time spent using moments of meditation. Times when you can get away and relax from your regular mundane activities."},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":" 32 The main thing is to keep the upper body in a vertical position. Horizontal = Sleep Put on some music. Turn out all of the lights, maybe light a candle. Start out simple and try not to move. At first, it can become uncomfortable, trying to hold the position. Don’t beat yourself over this. Scratch the itch if it just won’t go away. But try and slip back into neither mind. Peter Carroll’s Liber MMM from Liber Null is the perfect layout on how to do this. I believe his not allowing you to blink idea, not only close to impossible, but useless for LHP initiation. Beyond that, it is a great exercise, and serves as a basic way to teach your mind to be a magical mind. I will give short example of each, and what their uses can be for, but I recommend buying Carroll’s book for IOT initiation study. Motionlessness – As mentioned above. One should attempt to sit motionless. Trying not to move for as long as you can. One should shoot for a half hour goal. Once you reach that point it doesn’t have to be done daily. Best used to help you relax when you need to, or get mentally prepared for a ritual if you need to. The better you get at this the deeper connection you will feel to the Dark One. Breathing – Done usually while performing Motionlessness. Breathing at irregular patterns at your will. Directing all of your attention to the breathing. Not-Thinking – Attempting to completely quiet the mind is really tough. But if you are willing, it can be achieved in small doses. Image Concentration – This is where you teach yourself to project images into the air in front of you that only you can see. But it appears as real as you can make it. An example of what I like to use is a flaming red inverted Pentagram. Metamorphosis – Changing yourself to leave a bad situation or habit behind, is what this means. Changing little habits or acquiring new ones is a great way to start exploring your true potential.

If there was one think Anton Lavey hit on the nail was his description of Energy Vampires. Keeping it short and to the point...

Or get you to do something for them all the time. These people do so, often not even realizing what they are up to. If done as a form of LBM, it can be a dangerous skill to possess. But, to fall victim to it, is to at least learn from the experience. Next time say “No”.

This is your life. Charity is fine, when you fell like it. Banishing ? Banishing is a technique that is used in most magical acts, which take place at the beginning or end of a rite. Wicca traditions use banishing, mainly, to keep those bad things out of the circle. Chaos magicians tend to think of it more as an opportunity to their minds and prepare for the magical task at hand. If you want a quick banishing, done inside your mind just imagine a black orb surrounding you where you stand or the area where the rite will take place. You are centered within it and are at the core of the sphere. See the inside of the ball of black filling with mercury like fluid. Stand or sit in a Motionless position, feeling all of your “bad day”, thoughts that are overwhelming you being drawn out and absorbed by the fluid.

This is a simple secret of lesser forms of Black Magic. When you walk into the room smiling or happy, it puts everyone at ease. If you walk in nervous and showing it through your body language, it makes everyone else nervous and uncomfortable as well. Try walking into a bar, after convincing yourself mentally that no one is going to like you. Sit down next to someone, quietly looking at the bar. I doubt no one will talk to you unless they are too drunk to read your body language. Walk in like you know that you are the “shit” and notice everyone look at you. There is a quiet communication that happens everywhere we go. People can read our thoughts, perhaps not through words, but unconscious dialog.

Media Fasting For some, this act would come naturally. While it is rare, occasionally you will find sorcerers that refrain entirely from those TV / PC electric windows. These days’ buying a computer is so inexpensive, and going online virtually free, so just about everyone is doing it. I can spend several hours a day face up against a monitor and later wonder, first of all, just how much radiation my eyes are taking in?.. and... what am I doing? Throw all the new seasons shows on top of that. Followed up with a layer of this weekend’s football game. Mix in a sprinkle of the radio I listen to wherever I drive. Well, you get the picture...

Isolate Space When you find a space, in the corner of your house, that you want to set aside for your ritual and mind work, you should do it. There are successful magicians that do their work with no props, any time and anywhere. Open handed magick is the easiest to perform, but can only be learned from years of ceremonial ritual work. The importance of performing ritual will be different for everyone. But one thing is sure, is that you wouldn’t even think of doing the magical act to begin with if you didn’t believe it would have some effect on the situation. So make it believable to the Self. You gotta say this is a spot that is very magical for me. I used to have a room set up in the house that was set-aside just for ritual and spell work. I had X-mas lights around every wall and an altar with a blade (athame) , candles, chaosphere and / or pentagram, a chalice, incense, and all the props. Black robes, medallion, etc. It was very pleasing to my eyes, and when I stepped into this little space, I could almost feel the air crackling around me with magical electricity.

When you are in your ritual chamber and you send your Will off as a spell, you are using aether energy to project it into the future. Extreme forms of Aetherics would fall into a category consisting of powers of conscious levitation, flying, to smacking someone in the back of the head from across the room. For the most part, I don’t really see the necessity to become adept at these Matrix movie skills. At least not in an objective reality sense. In your mind you can fly, or do just about whatever you want to. This occurs most of the time when you are dreaming. The key is developing a visualization skill that is consistent and to the same level of reality bringing the event, at least from your subjective point of view, into reality. In a banishing, when you are carving a flaming pentagram into the air in front of you. Develop the skill to hear the flames licking the air. To feel the heat resonating from the fire. The smell of singed hair, from your hand being too close. You subjective perceptions should always be manipulated in one way or another when working with Aetherics. If there is a person in line at the grocery store, see your hand grab that ass, nice and firm to satisfy the craving. Try projecting a whisper of your desire into her ear beyond normal hearing range.

Convincing yourself that you believe in something, at any given moment can empower you to be able to sever a tie to something that is a hindrance.

"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":" 44 Gnosis When trying to achieve neither / neither there are many of techniques one may employ to achieve gnosis. Austin Spare made records of using a technique known as the death posture. This was his technique of choice that he would use, but over the years, there have been many modern magicians that, through experimentation have found many new and interesting ways to achieve this. On the pages following, I will go into brief details on several of the techniques that I know of and have used personally to achieve gnosis. Once you find a technique that works best for you, it isn’t a bad idea to stick to it, since the purpose of doing magic is to get results. If you are doing it just to entertain yourself, you are probably doing it for the wrong reasons. For the most part, when one is doing ritual magic using props to set the mood, it is really a theatrical event set up to take you from the regular mundane world and allow you to focus on the work at hand. Gnosis is a great tool to withdraw the mind from the over stimulation the world brings without need of props, unless you choose to use them. In attempting to achieve gnosis, I also suggest that you dress comfortably for the best results. Several of the most efficient mages that I know wouldn’t be caught dead in a ceremonial robe. I for one find that there are times when they are useful, but agree, at least when doing gnosis work, robes can get in the way. And, when used in a regular basis, can make it difficult for you to become efficient at performing magic on the fly, outside your ritual chamber, without your props or ritual garb. What you choose to do is ultimately up to you. Achieving (Noesis) Gnosis Death Posture – There are many different ways to achieve gnosis. Peter Carroll in his book Liber Null makes a mention of this forced form of gnosis. Practiced by Austin Spare. One blocks the airways with ones own hands and if they fall down their breathing returns to normal as they drift off into a momentary state of being. The secret is not to do anything which could compromise your ability to breath once this state is reached. Obviously this could cause accidental death. Therefore I strongly suggest never using anything that is used to assist in this such as rope or plastic. I find the death posture to be very dangerous and should only be done at your own risk and discretion."},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":" 45 Exhaustion – Pushing the body to great exertion can cause gnosis as well. Forcing your heart to speed up by running in place for example and then stopping suddenly can sweep the mind into gnosis. This can also be dangerous if you are out of shape. As you know under normal circumstances, after running a race one would walk off the exhaustion and allow the body to cool down slowly and safely. Therefore be careful with this technique too. Stillness – If you are patient, and have some time to slowly achieve gnosis, this can be the most rewarding way to do this. Basically, it is done through meditation if you are already trained to do so. Sitting in place with your eyes open staring at a sigil until it slips off into a blur and then bringing it back into focus while the mind is completely silent is a great way to achieve this. Orgasm – This is one of the most accepted techniques for gnosis among black magicians everywhere. It’s doesn’t take a lot of thought and can be achieved alone without a partner. It can be used in an elaborate sex magic working or a simple “boot knocking” session with a sigil of intent held within the minds eye at the point of ejaculation or orgasm. Bondage – To voluntarily submit oneself to be tied up for an extended amount of time can put you into an alternate state of consciousness. Spanking - Like bondage or in conjunction with the above technique, obviously will bring about the desired effect. There is a certain degree of pain which through repetition, one slips into an alternate state. This technique has been used for centuries by witches and magicians of the past. Definitely worth experimenting with at least once. Chemical – While this is the most controversial technique, it cannot be dismissed. Some that have experimented with mind altering drugs have said that they felt separated from the physical self or an enhanced awareness of the higher / lower Self within. Having experimented myself with Marijuana, LSD, Mushrooms, etc. I can say that I have had success with them for desired effects. One should realize the risks when experimenting and remember that you are doing so at your own risk. There are actually too many ways to achieve gnosis to mention. Or more than I care to mention here. I do recommend checking out an Anipi or a sensory deprivation tank if you are ever given an opportunity to partake. "},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":" 46 Death of Belief One thing I have found is that when you are around something enough, that it has a way of ingraining a belief of some sort to my mind. In extreme cases, I have fallen prey to belief models that have held back my potential self from materializing. Death of Belief is a technique which I find very similar to what is known as NLP or meta-programming. Say Christian thought, for example, has persuaded you to believe that something you want is a sin (but is not unlawful) to desire. Simply replace the old belief with one that encourages you to explore this part of the self that feels incomplete. Setting Up a Ritual Space The ritual space that you call your own should be comfortable or at least conductive to your brand of magical work. If this is something that you are trying for the first time, it can be as simple as a Ganesha statue on top of the tv in your apartment. And could expand to the point of throwing a Seal of Babalon onto the wall. Candles on the dresser. If it adds potency to your magical space, so be it. I will not try and go into all of this here, since one man's heaven is another man's hell. Or one man's trash is another man's treasure... and mainly because you probably already know how to set up your personal temple for yourself. You are magician dammit. But to set it up for a group working. This is another story. Remember, the space should be utilized and set up to divorce all participants from the mundane world. Cover the furniture with sheets. Take the family portraits down. Play some tribal music. Perhaps pass around a glass of something delicious for everyone to partake in to help draw everyone in to the work at hand and to lower the walls of each persons inhibitions. If it is everyone's will. All should be in harmony and in agreement on the focus of the ritual. If there is even one member that is uncomfortable or disagrees with the intent, then the working will probably fail.

The problem is in trying to discern which groups are for real and which are just a waste of time. There is really only one way to know and that is to explore the group or organization yourself. If you find them on the web, and that they do not meet together in a face to face gathering, chances are they just want your money.

Some of them have a lot to offer the aspiring magician. For example, the IOT and the TOS meet in groups. They have international gatherings annually. They also have decent correspondence with their membership. However these groups may not be of use to you. You have to read up on their philosophies for yourself to decide. Meet new people – One way that is useful to meeting like minded magicians to practice with is to frequent your local metaphysical shop. Most of them host lectures from authors and local covens and organizations. Exchange ideas. Ask a lot of questions. Experiment. Open Hand Magic One way one can attempt their adepthood in magic is to try weaving a spell without using any of the prescribed tools.

We focus mainly on the Self, and exploring the unlimited possibilities of Self-elevation and discovery using chaos magick as the main tool. While we are not a \"satanic\" group, we do find the \"Adversary\" deities (ex. Satan, Typhon, Shiva, or Innana, Prometheus, and Sekhmet) to be the main guiding forces of our work and to express our need to be Independent Beings. You are not obligated to use these types of warrior deities outside our assemblages, however, it should be expected and encouraged to be the focus of our meetings and social gatherings. (Wearing an inverted pentagram would not be considered inappropriate.) Also, many \"mundane world\" field trips will be focused on, but not limited to, using Lesser Black Magic techniques as well as discussions and workshops focused on Spare's Book of Pleasure, Carroll's Liber Null, and Hine's Condensed Chaos, or whatever floats all of our boats. We will cast spells, but will step into the world that we hurl our chaos stars into and live life to the fullest. We understand the Kia may have many voices, and we will give power to the one that \"exists in the shadows\". We call this an \"Experiment\" since we will be attempting to fuse chaos magic to the concepts of Western LHP specifically. We aren't the only ones doing this in the world, but we certainly were the first to do so as a group. As a Magician, wanting to use chaos magick as a technology instead of a belief model, one should use the criteria described by Stephen Flowers in Lords of the Left Hand Path. According to him, there are two things that separate us, as well as our work, from the right hand path in all our labors. 1) Self-Deification - An individual awaking of the self and existence separate from the collective universe on one's own terms. According to the accepted chaos paradigm, we are all part of the random collective. While it has been argued that chaos magic does not always fall under the category of a paradigm where the magician surrenders to the chaos collective, it"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":" 51is something that you will find documented in Liber Null and is the idea behind many chaos magician's perspectives. 2) Antinomianism - Going against the grain or laws of a system or belief structure. By not accepting all that is presented by the originators of the chaos magick technologies and philosophies, we are using it according to our individual needs. Chaos magic as a whole could be defined as being Antinomian to begin with, but Carroll, Hine, and Spare did sort of lay out, ground rules for perceiving the universe. Their books give specific recipes on how one might define the way chaos works. We agree with them that chaos magic works. However, we choose to apply it in conjunction with the ideas of Flowers description of the LHP, since \"everything is permitted.\" IN CONCLUSION We are an experiment in creating Order out of Chaos. *During this time of crisis within the world, we would like to point out that this is an attack of the senses. When we say creating order out of chaos, we simply mean that we forge our path within the random world we live in.
