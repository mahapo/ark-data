[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"Standing Stones as Strange Attractors A Speculation by Jaq. D. Hawkins The science of chaos is of interest to many magicians. There are several books in print on the subject, two of which are listed in the sources section at the end of this article.1,2 For those who are unfamiliar with the subject, I offer a simplified explanation. In the 1960's and 70's, a few scientists began finding order within the disorder of natural phenomena, such as turbulence in the atmosphere and bodies of water, fluctuations in wildlife population, etc. They were mathematicians, physicists, biologists, chemists, all seeking connections between different types of irregularity. They used computers to create special kinds of graphic images which capture the delicate structure underlying complexity in nature. They found that order arises spontaneously out of chaotic systems, and simple mathmatical equations are used to model systems every bit as violent as a waterfall. Simple deterministic models could produce what looked like random behaviour. A scientist by the name of Edward Lorenz is credited with the discovery of the 'strange attractor', which is a point in phase space which attracts the movements of molecules into spiral patterns. In chaotic systems, the molecules never follow the same path around the attractor, but create a pattern of folds within folds in the pattern, always staying within a limited range. This can apply to any types of molecule, fluids, gases, or energy. The original Lorenz attractor moves in a double-spiral pattern around two strange attractors. Other shapes were later created, but the data was always pulled into visible shapes. \"Of all the possible pathways of disorder, nature favours just a few.\"1 For many centuries, science has been discovering explanations for things once called magic.3 It seems reasonable to theorize that our ancestors may have found a way to tap into the natural energy of the earth, depicting their mental images of this energy in diagrams. The inner-folding pathways depicted by the Lorenz diagrams brings to mind the labrinth patterns depicted on the Glastonbury Tor and other sites. The patterns twist within themselves, covering every bit of space within a constricted area, yet the paths never cross. Some of the spiral patterns surrounding a single attractor are reminiscent of the spiral patterns carved on ancient monoliths, known as 'cup and ring' markings. Scientist and archaeologists have been speculating on the purpose of standing stones and stone circles for many years. Some validity can be found for many theories, the most wisely accepted being for astronomical observation. While this theory seems to fit well with the positioning of the stones erected into circles, it does not explain the individual stones found in a wide variety of situations. Some of these stones have been credited as marking stones for old Roman roads, yet others are found standing in fields or other out of the way locations. These stones are often believed by the local population to have healing properties. Many people have experienced a \"tingling\" sensation when they touch the stones, and in some cases a violent rocking sensation that seems very powerful.

A Welsh water diviner, Bill Lewis, and John Taylor, professor of mathematics at Kings College, London, made an attempt to measure electromagnetic force on a stone in Crickhowell in South Wales. They used an instrument called a 'gaussmeter', which is used to measure static magnetic field strength. A young Argentinian physicist, Dr. Eduardo Balanovski, went along to see if there was anything odd about the stone. When he pointed the meter to the stone, the needle shot up to capacity. Not only did the stone have a measurable energy field, but the strength could be measured in bands around the stone. Possibly a spiral? There has not been enough 'proper ' scientific research on this subject to draw any hard conclusions, but the evidence seems to point to these stones somehow acting as amplifiers for natural energy currents within the earth. There is some evidence that these stones are placed above points where two or more underground streams cross. Water moving through an underground tunnel creates a small electric charge. The charge is stronger where these streams cross. Keeping in mind the spiral patterns of turbulence, now measurable by chaos science methods, the theory exists that the stones are charged by this hydroelectric reaction. The molecular structure of quartz is spiral, and quartz seems to be a constituent of every 'active' stone. Coincidence? Modern man is always eager to believe that our ancestors were primative animals, with nothing more important to think about than their next meal, but the evidence is increasingly pointing to a different picture. One where our ancestors had architectural and building skills, mathematical and astronomical knowledge. The next obvious step is to discover a way to use this energy spiraling around the stone. What did our ancestors use it for? The answer is yet to be discovered. Sources: (1) \"CHAOS, making a new science\" by James Gleick (2) \"TURBULENT MIRROR\" by John Briggs & F.
