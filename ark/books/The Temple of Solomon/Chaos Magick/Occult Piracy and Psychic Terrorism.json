[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"Occult Piracy and Psychic Terrorism“The Politics of the Inbetween Spaces\" A Mage is truly a mighty Cyclone of Power who skrys into history the sharp Vampiric Vorpal blade of Psychic Terrorism. Anyone who has ever given a serious and unbiased--for the most part--scholarly look into mythology and the histories of religions knows this: The belief systems and dogmas of religion change to meet the times. Anton LaVey reflected this sentiment when he proclaimed ‘Christianity is getting more Satanic all the time” in other words, as the climate of our culture gets more liberal (as it WAS when he wrote that statement!!) so too does the general religious climate flex to varying degrees to meet the times. To support the idea further, when one looks at the dogmas of Christianity actually PRACTICED by Christians vs. what is actually WRITTEN, one can see that some ideas are tossed to the wayside because they don’t seem relevant to the times or just simply not convenient.: Look how many modern Christians remarry!! That is completely forbidden in the Bible! Prohibitions on certain food have been conveniently dropped as well as other text so called GOD’S words apparently not seen by the modern Christian. Now, even though Christianity DESERVES all the bashing it can get, bashing religion wasn’t the sole purpose of this article. My point is this: Reinterpretation of religions to meet the current times is an ancient well established practice. How else could religion keep followers? Religions must adapt to the times or they become completely extinct. Furthermore, they must bash the competition, often through completely insidious ways, so that their religions remains supreme by popular opinion—aha we’ve caught a Psyops operation because “my JEHOVAH is the biggest baddest asshole around.” Well without boring the reader by giving millions of detailed historical factoids, suffice to say that when one looks into ancient mythology (Keep in mind Christianity is Modern mythology! one finds various versions and portrayals of the same Gods and stories. For instance Latter Day Egypt portrays Set as completely despicable, whereas rumor has it that once he was dear to many a’ Egyptian. The Greek Goddess Hekate similarly has gone through all kinds of popularly conceived portrayals as well. (based on WHEN it was written and what culture/or which author did the writing.) In some accounts she is young, beautiful, giver of life, in others an ancient horrifying hag—Goddess of the despised Witches! A very obvious example is the Devil; who now is portrayed having pointed animal horns on his head looking JUST like the Greek god Pan and his fellow Satyrs; Of course whereas Pan was once a good thing to the Greeks, representing carnal and cosmic bliss and rampant fertility and sexuality; he got a name change and became the spirit of everything bad—in the eyes of the dominator’s unquestionable(?) religious opinion. Yes, Pan must have been so popular a God as to be a threat to the up&coming Christian religion that they couldn’t just recruit him, no, the god of free sex had to be put down, they HAD to identify him with everything unsavory..The newly modified character profile became conveyed at a shockingly emotional level as a personal nightmarish threat and was used to terrify the naïve peasants into new religious servitude, who by that time had well forgotten where the original image was stolen from. We moderns call that effective propaganda and mind control..yes, a psychological operation, brainwashing. Is it more than a coincidence that The New Testament just happened to be written in Greek?!!"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Yes, it is true, the Gods of the Past often become the Demons and Devils of the future. But other things happen as well. These Dominating religions take over the previous religions sacred sites, constructing their own fortress/temples right on top of the old sites. Sometimes they simply move in and hire new interior decorators. This tactic proves completely convenient because these sites provide ‘occult energy’; that is why they were chosen in the first place, and, the lay population is in the habit of going to that particular spot to worship and will most likely continue to visit the spot regardless of the occupying religion. Well, guess what happens when the above two tactics prove fruitless?What happens when the new dominator religion just can’t get the people to give up stubborn faith in the old gods? When fear and occupation just don’t cut it? Piracy! Catholicism and Buddhism may once have been Monotheistic religions, but something had be done. Polytheism was just too popular to ignore. But giving up the Ghost was no option either. So piracy came into play. Now, piracy is for the most part always on the pirates terms, but in these cases what was being robbed was religious iconography, ceremony and conventional symbology for public popularity so some compromises had to be made. The imagery and some of the ceremony was allowed to exist but the INTERPRETATION was changed to fit a new appropriate context; and of course the newly pirated Gods could no longer fill the role of being supreme but were forced to take subordinate positions. In the case of Buddhism this meant the old gods became glorified workers for the Buddha. (Bodhisattvas, lesser gods and spirits) and in Catholicism it meant they became identified with saints and angels—i.e. servants of God. This allowed the peasant the peace of identifying with the ancient imagery under the watchful eye of the priest who saw that their energy was focused in the ‘right’ fashion. So the conquering religions used these correct tactics and won the hearts and minds of the people right? Well yes, maybe, but lo and behold something always is a creepin from behind the scenes. If the religion was too harsh, as in the case of Catholism dominating Europe and Buddhism forging a path of blood through ancient shamanic Tibet and various other places in the orient, it is bound to make some enemies. Guess who the rebel secretly admires? The Gods who were made enemies alas devil(s) now become the new God(s) of the rebel; on the logic that an enemy of what one personally hates must be an ally/friend. So an old god get reborn in new clothes—the antithesis of the old religion, and it steadily gains recruits--at first secret followers and later openly self-proclaimed followers. Something else happens as well. As time passes the conquering religions begins to become more and more like the religion it crushed. Yes, ‘you are what you eat’ is historically correct for religions. Cross-contamination will occur. You cannot fuck indiscriminately forever and not wind up with a disease. So as pure, white and wholesome as Buddhism and Christianity tried to appear, they ended up with ancient ceremonially-enacted rites of Cannibalism—horrifying if one thinks about its’ true original meaning. (on the other hand delightful if one thinks of the wicked implication!)Yet it had to stay for the group psychological effect was just too good to pass up. Now, for sake of the discussion Voodoo must be brought up. In far more historically recent times, the ancient religion of Voodoo was brought over to the Americas by the African slaves. Voodoo"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"gave the slaves a sense of group identity and group identity eventually spelled out group power. From what I understand, the practice of Voodoo was at first ignored by the plantation farmers, but later when they began to understand the potentially powerful rebellious psychological effect Voodoo had for the slaves, the plantation owners decided it must be stopped. The plantation farmers began systematically converting the slaves to Catholicism/Christianity. Now in this case the Voodooists beat the Catholics to the punch. Perhaps by this time Catholism was too powerful and set in its ways to adapt, so instead of the old tactic of Piracy, the Catholic religion remained unchanged, but instead the slaves who were now being forced to submit to a foreign religion began cleverly identifying the Saints as masks for their gods, so that the slaves could secretly keep their faith and give lip service to the priesthood at the same time. In time Cross-contamination again occurred but this time it was Voodoo which eventually got affected. A better option than complete submission! Much of Voodoo today, especially Santeria shows Catholic influence. So what does all this mean for the modern Occultist—especially the modern Chaoist? Many major contemporary religions hold ancient imagery and practices which at one time were pirated and assimilated in Borg-like fashion into its’ religious collective. These techniques and old ways can be re-extracted to the benefit of the Magician as long as the Magician is able to keep ones wits about them and not get absorbed into its’ collective. Using preexisting God-forms instead of self created Godforms {self created godforms have their own advantages but I won’t go into that discussion in this article}have the advantage that they have been previously build up with massive amounts of psychic energy, usually through devotion, over great lengths of time. This can be quite a benefit to the Magician because innately old gods hold vast reservoirs of power. On the other hand because they contain so much power they can also be a danger. One can put ones’ foot in the water only to find one is being unconsciously swept away. Remember the story of the Sorcerer’s apprentice? This can happen at a psychic level as one taps the God form’s energy and religious current it had been nested in. Fight for your psychic terrain and feel free to pirate any religious symbol, technique or God to your belief system. Just beware of cross-contamination. Don’t become a Hindu because you have pirated ‘Shiva’. Inject him with viral chaostars and give him new agendas in accordance with your will. Find the best portrayal of him to suit your needs. Don’t worry about contradictory statements. Shiva has been called celibate as well as the womanizing spreader of seed. Choose the descriptions most appropriate to your workings and most meaningful to oneself and lastly, Watch out for Dogmas!!!---Frater Archarion"}]
