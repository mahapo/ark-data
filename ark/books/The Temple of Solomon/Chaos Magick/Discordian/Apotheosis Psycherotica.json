Thisyouknow. Whatyoumay notknowis whatoccuredduringthefinalmonths of TheChurchin2002CE, which canonlybe described as The Scandal.Not much wasrecordedabout The Scandal at thetime, except for a briefarticleonpage 4 of thePittsburghPost-Gazettewhich got many of thefactswrong[1] andmis-spelled “Trachtenberg” while alsomis-identifyingher as the inspiration for Arana (in truth, it was Hekate, agoodfriend ofLordChuff). What we have managedto piece together from those willing to talk about it and the policerecordsis as follows:Anorganizationcallingitself“fuck thepilusophyrevolution” (ftpr)showedupat a local coffeehousecalled “The Bee-Hive” which was theofficialmeetingplace for TheChurchof Psycherotica. Thegroupportrayeditselfas a surrealist artgroupfocusing primarilyonsurrealistpornographyandphilosophicallysocio-politicalranting.At thattime, there wereonlythreemembersin thegroup:SaulMacTheknife,an older gentlemanwho,while soft-spoken, carried a big pen;v]&s decabiA,whodisappearedafterthefirstday and wasneverspokenof again (as Sarah Sinclairwouldlater find out, he had been arrested forexposinghimselfat aplaygroundintheBrooklineneighborhood); andKristanXara,a fourteen-year-old girlwhofancied herself to be some form ofdivine prostitute but, in thecourseof the investigation, wasdiscoveredto be avirgin(bya hymen-relatedtechnicality).Havingnoadvanceknowledgeof events to come,norof the true nature of thegroup, TheChurchofPsycheroticarecognizedftpr asmembersin an anaceremony which wasneverheld (which is what one does anddoes notdowith anaceremonies).Aroundthetimethat the otheranonymouswas finishing trade school andLordChuff was forced to redactthe writings of Dos (pronounced“Dose”)afterDos quitworkingat the Bee-Hive,JosephRaschack was invitedto watch an ftpr art session. After the session was completed,Josephquicklyalerted the police.Accordingto the evidence the policefoundin Saul MacTheknife'shouse, he and hisdaughterKristan Xarawere in the habit of makingcopiousamounts of childpornographyand snufffilms, featuring Kristan and her“friends” from school.AllJosephever said about that day was:“Havingjust watched a teenage girl bemolested, raped, andsnuffed, I canonlysay, without adoubt,thateverythingftpr has ever written is en-fucking-theta.Fuckftpr. Just delete it andhopethere's a hellforthemtoburnin.”Shortythereafter, TheChurchof Psycheroticabrokeup, due mainly toLordChuff's refusal to perform thedesired redactions.Accordingto him: “Enoughmaterialwas lostafterDosleft. I mean, shit, just read theBookof theIntroduction. Itdoesn't matterif it's removed or not. Ifyou don't like it,don't read it. It's not scripture,y' know.”To this day, the bodies of the children seen in therecoveredphotosandfilmhave not beenfound.

Before I had everheardof Her, She wasinspiringmeto create a cult.A few scripturespoppedup, mostly one-pagelameattemptsat startingorgyclubs so I couldfinallylose myvirginity.Then, one day, aclassmatenamed “Jesus Joe” typedupa one-page pamphlet about him being “Jesus,Lordof theMonkeys” and it included ashortquote from theBook of Chuff(chapter 6, verse66, ofcourse). Iforget what the quote said, but the idea of aBook of Chuffstuck withme.Eventually, I wrote it. Thebookwas abunchofnonsenseabout petrocks, hookercats, and a psychotic inthewoodswith a big knifewhokepttryingto stabme.The dayafterI wrote it, I decided an entireTestament of Psychosiswas inorder. Unfortunately, onlyoneotherpersonbotheredwritinganything, and it was about dyslexicducksand someguynamed Petrofski.So, I started writing morebooksonmyown, astro-turfing severalpseudonymns(not really, I just wantyoutothinkI did).

By way ofintroduction, she gavemean earth-shattering orgasm in theshower.Needless to say, it wasalldown-hill from there.Eventually, Ibrokefree of theobsessionsimplybybeingobsessed. Theverynature of theobsessioncaused it tobreakitself. I realized that the definition of religion hasnothingtodowithgodsor creation orphilosophyor morality; a religion isanythingthat so consumes apersonthat thepersonactually confuses itwith theirownexistance (divine plan, meaning oflife, holymission, et cetera).I started at the end of the Principia, andendedup onpage00004: “ADiscordianis Prohibitedof BelievingWhat he Reads.” I said tomyself, If so, then a Psycherotic isprohibitedof believing what hewrites.(Oddlyenough, the entiretimeI wasobsessed, there was a thing with the number four being bad or evil or justsomething to beavoided.)The point of this essay issimple: Read the Principiaforward, backward, or randomly, buthoweveryouread it,pay attention!It could just saveyourmind.“Thisbookis a mirror.Whena monkeylooksin,noapostlelooksout.”—Lichtenberg, PrincipiaDiscordia, pg 00022"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"4267)+(→←ISYOURCHEESEPLEASED?Warning:Thisis an advertisementmadebyPsycheroticsand may be unfitforNormals.It's notnewthatpeopledisregardanythingthat looksreligious.But this ain't noreligion!This is a druginducedritual orgy ofmassproportions!Yes, nowyoutoo can haveyourcakeand eat it too!(if you're into that kind of thing...)Psycheroticadoes itallto you!Fantasticsex,freedrugs,andadulterous truthawaityou!This is themostinsanenon-religiousnon-parody parodyreligionyou'll ever notice!SanitythroughInsanity!

These dream-screenscome in two varieties—theHAPPY-SHINEY-PICTURE-SHOWvariety and theSOLITAIREkind.Certain Normuliancommunitiesin varied parts of the Earth lackproperHAPPY-SHINEY-PICTURE-SHOWemitterdream screens, which leads toCivilDisobedience and otherworksof literature. Theamassmentof these literature pieces allows for a gnomic caste, which childe-personsof the Normulian ilk areexposedto aschildren, so as toproperlyscaretheminto not wanting to haveanythingtodowiththemwhatsoever.Erotica asportrayedbyNormuliancorporatemediadream-screen isconsumption-based rather thanprocreative.Amongsuch erotica available are toothpaste (“brightensand whitens”), Barbee (not inactualityabee,nora bar, but rather amammarianwomb-worldgyne-representation icon without distinguishablereproductivefunctions and a removeable head).AlthoughinactualityNormulian sexual intercourse iscompulsoryafterage18, it'sadvertizementis delegated tolate-hours, in line with feeding habits,productivitytables andHAPPY-SHINEY-PICTURE-SHOWviewinghours.

From her comesalljoyand for her we lust. She is not any one thing we desire, she is thereasonforourdesire, thefulfillmentandpleasure ofhaving/doing.Some maygoastray of Arana. Theydenytheir true desire foranotherone. They have beenmisledand made awrongdecision, which will end in misery and despair.

Her fire is the one thatburnswithin us, exciting us to the heights of ecstacy.Also, a redletter“A” in a circle is her symbol because “A” is Arana'sinitial, red is the color ofpassion, andcircles usually have somemetaphysicalusage. (Try not to confuse any of this with that NathanielHawthornenovel or certainpoliticalsymbolisms.)Since it is Arana's fire within us that causesourdesire andpassion, and it is for her that we truly lust, shebecomes thebeginningand end of desire; the alpha and omega of lust. Without her,allwouldbemechanicalmotion andplannedparenthood. (In otherwords, boring.)Chapter 4: TheCall toAranaIt is one thing to believe that lust and desire is for Arana, it is quiteanothermattertowillfullyandwontonlypursueher infetish-sex, and recieve fully her divine pleasure of Orgasm.

To say aunicorndoes not exist is toignorethe existingconcept of aunicorn. Unicornsare notfoundin existing nature,onlyin the imagination. To say, “I AM NOT,”is toignorethe concept of “I,” which exists (if I may say somyself). There isnoduality to existence, it isallencompassing. Even thenon-existent exist. Talk to the No-people.

Theconcept of dualityneverchanges, onlythe definitions within the concept, i.e., the duality as a concept,good/evil, hot/cold, chaos/orderas definitions. Even Stasis and Change are definitions.But, somewherebehindthe definitions of Change and Stasis, there is aquestion. What is Stasis? Stasis iswithout Change. What is Change? Change is without Stasis. So, thequestionbehindthis becomes: Whatifthere isonlyChange; and Stasis is anartificialconcept invented for thepurposeof creating a duality? Then theentire duality becomes arbitrary and useless. This leads us to: What is Change without Stasis? What is one sidewithout the other? What else can it be besides what it is? Energy. Ah, but isn'tenergyandmattera duality?

The manuscripts,havingbeen writtenonsilk sheets, weremainlyignoredfor the last twothousandyears, sincenoone everconsideredthe possibility that they wereanythingother than an old shawl.Onlywhena child was locked inSub-basement 5 whileplayingpredator–prey(similarto hide-and-seek but with lesshiding) and decided to stopcryingand take a nap was itdiscoveredthat there was actually something writtenonthem.Thefirstproblemafterfinding the manuscripts wasdustingthem. Thesecondwas translating thetitle. Thewhole of the text isundeniablyearlygreek, but thetitlecontainsnon-greekcharacters. Not until Ummofirstcontacted the AssitianOrderwas it learned that thetitlewasummite.

Wefinallymanaged,afterfive years ofetymologicalresearch of theummitelanguage, toconcludethat it was,literally, “ADuckPond.” Disconcerting, eh?The rest was relatively easy, seeing ashowthe AssitianOrderhasthoroughdocumentationonallancientEuropeanlanguagesandsocieties.

The solution to that is not to stop people fromdoingthat, but to increasepilusophy'snotionof responsibilebehavior.I'm reallyundernoillusions that we can make a perfect sexualphilosophy.

As a strictlynon-practicedsexuality, as withallnon-practicedsexualities, it is perfectlyokay.The currentapproachto pedophilia is a bitparanoid, I think. That is partly a result of society'sunwillingnesstoadmitthat children can be theleastbit interested in sex, and partly the result of the RMT/FMSepidemic. At theveryleast, I want to seeoursociety educating childrenonthedangersandconsequencesof sex. As they say,“Talk toyourkids.

Prostitution. Sexuality. Promiscuity.Feminism. All these issues and struggleshave been discussed, misinterpreted, usedbypeople andgroupsto win somepowerand try to control others.Usually, in thismess, the subject of sex and sexualbehaviourcropsuptimeandtimeagain. To win theirarguments, a lot of politicians, middle classfeminists, and religious bigots havelaunchedattacksonworkingclass people's sex lives.The arguments and debates have beenconfusingand haveleftpeople feeling guilty about totally naturalsexual desire andbehaviour. This has not helped women, men, orourclass as a whole.We haveproducedthisarticleto get the juices flowing. Wedon't want to control or put people's livesonguilt trips, like so many others—wedowant to fight for aworldwhere sex, likeeveryother arena ofourlives,is healthy, free ofunnecessaryconfusion, and controlledbyus, not thepowersthat be.In thelate1970s and early1980s, the politics of sexchanged. Sexbecamethebannerunderwhichallwomen, regardless of their class, race, or nationality, weresupposedlyunited.Suddenlythe bizarre idea thatsex=porn=men=violencebecamea universal equation.Thetheorywas so reactionary that, at thetime, it washardto seperate the voices of the radicalleftfromthe extreme right.StorySo FarUp until thistime, thebattlehad been tobringinto theopenthe discrimination that women facedeveryday. The overall mood was thatanythingwas possible—women were insistingonbreakingout of the repressiveroles that had been forcedonthem. They demanded that women's sexual pleasureshouldbe a fundamental partof any heterosexual relationship.In the1990s, unlessyou're a religious or sexual bigot, this is just plain common sense. But in the1970stheworldjust wasn't used to women definingthemselvesas sexual beings.Womenbeganexploringsexualpossibilities, which wasbotha painful and a liberating experience.However, this was ashorthalcyonperiodoftime, and one that was replacedbythetheorythat sexualliberation was adangerousthing—if womenbecametoo sexually liberated, then menwouldholdit againstthem.While some women werebraveenoughto leap into theunknown, others wereclaimingthat women'ssexuality had been so colonised and threatened that there wasonlyone route to take: battendownthe hatches,and try to get rid ofeverythingthat was, andstillis, unpleasant and nasty.Because sex and desire can't be described as rational, these feelings have always been associated withchaos andnon-conformity.Middle classfeministswanted the women'smovementto have the aura of respectability. Due to thesereactionaries, Victorian valuesbecamedressedupasfeministthought.SomeHistoryMiddle class Victorian women and somesuffragetteshad establishedthemselvesas moral authorities.Even some of the most radical nineteenthcenturyactivistshad accepted the overall view that men are sexualpredators, and that “fallen” women werevictimsofthem.Ofcourse, the view also held that married middle class women were sexuallypure.Thesuffragette, ChristobelPankhurst, claimedthat women had to be sexuallyabovereproachto bemorallyworthyof the vote! Needless to say, thisdidn't apply to menwhoalready had the vote and ran theworld.The right, likePankhurst, has always tried to keep women asprisonersbyemphasising the idea thatwomen's “feminine” nature isessentiallydifferentfrom mens'.Feministsbegantofallinto the trap of idealisingwomen in much thesameway—claimingthat they were celebrating, rather thanpunishing, “difference.”The result was,whethera woman is stuckup onan angelic pedestal ofpurity, or stuck in the kitchen inbetweendroppingcountless babies, she'sstillstuck."},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"139Then,whenthe middle classsuffragettes, activists, and right-wingersallgot into bed with biologicaltheories, theyturnedsex into abattleground. These theories stated that women are passivenurturersand menare activeaggressors.The idea was that women have to playvictimalways. So it wasn't a greatsurprisethatwhenthe sexbacklash started in the1970s, talking about womenenjoyingheterosexual sex, it was seen asfeministheresy.Sex andSexismSexbeganto be blamed forallsexism. Thefactthat the way webringupourchildren, and the way thatwomen arepoliticallyand economically controlled,tooka back seat in the sex politics of the day—they weren'tseen as keys to women'soppression.It wasn't just sexual violence and sexism, but fucking in general, thatbecamethemainissue ofgenderpolitics.Women were universalvictims, havingtoendurewhatever was forceduponthemsexually,bymen. Theconcept ofconsensual, exciting sex wasn't evenonthe agenda.Men, especiallyworkingclass men, were generally seen astimebombs, waiting to be activatedbya quickglance at awankmagazine. The argument thatreducingheterosexual sex to ano-gostatuswouldlimit, ratherthanexpand, women's sexual and general freedoms, was seen as an argument collaborating with the enemy.In aworldwhich usually reliesoncopulation for us tosurvive, gatheringtogether to wipe out intercoursewas tooself-destructive, and equallyun-natural, even for followers of such puritanicalfeministsas theAmerican,AndreaDworkin. As a result, manybeganto attackpornography, to attack sex, rather than to attackthe exploitation of women. “Pornis thetheory. Rape is the practice,”becamefeministbywords. There waslittledata tosupportthetheory, but sex is tooemotivean issue to needfactualback-up. As a result, the struggle forwomen's greater economic,intellectual, and sexual freedom was replacedbydemands forcensorship.Porno WarsIndenouncingpornography, feminismfounditselfalliedwith right-wingfundamentalists. Churchgroupsand right-wingpressuregroupsjoinedfeministsin blamingpornographyfor sexism.Whileoursociety ishighlycontrolled and deeply sexist,pornographymay mirror sexism, but itnevercreated it. Mostpornis incredibly stupid and quite evidently exploits women as objects with wide-openorifices,beckoning: “I'm lovely, I'myourplaything, dowhatyouwant tome.” However, it is misleading toclaimthatallpornis violent anddangerous.Anti-porncampaigners oftenstatethatallwomen hatepornography; addingthatallwomenworkingin thesexindustryarevictims.Rather than calling for saferworkingenvironments for sexworkers, middle classmoralists, bigots, andintellectualshave called for more repressive laws and socialstigma. The result is that itunofficiallygives thego-ahead to the waybothpolice andpuntersbrutalise womenworkingin the sexindustry—and that is violenceand sexism.It is ironic that police raids more often than not target gay literature and culture. While softpornsits lessthan prettilyonthe top shelf ofyourlocalnewsagents, gaybookshopshave had copsstrippingtheir shelves ofOscar Wilde'swork.Feminists, past and present, maydowell torememberthatwhenMargaret Thatcher,JohnMajor, NeilKinnock, andTonyBlairareonyourside,you've got serious problems.Whenpoliticians say that they want tolegislateto help the anti-porncampaigns, then it'sobviouslynot the statusquothat they'll be legislating against.Feministswhowant the law toclampdownonpornand the sexindustryclaimthat they are not anti-sex.Whenpornographyhas been stamped out, they say they'll be more thanhappyto see it replacedby“erotica.”Apparently, “erotica” isaestheticallypleasing, whereaspornis simplymanipulative. But class prejudiceandaestheticsgohandinhand—if the middle andrulingclasses like a sexyimage, theysanitiseit bycalling iterotic art. At thesametime, the things that turn theworkingclassesonget labelled as “smut.” We're notreferring to, oradvocating, things like theCarry OnfilmsorHustlermagazineeither.Whothen has the right to decide what's art and what's smut? Usually it's middle classacademicswhoassume the right. They haveneverbeenknowntosupporteither class struggle, or in this case, the sexualliberation and freedoms ofbothworkingclass women and men, regardless ofwhetherthey're gay, straight, orbisexual.Theydo, however, fulfila verysimilarrole to thescientistsof VictorianEngland, with their “biologicalarguments,” and themoralistsof oldwhowanted women to be chaste andpurewomen before they had theright to vote."},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"140Are YouProtected?Class politics are part and parcel of sexual politics. The Victorian idea that theworkingclasses must beprotected from theirownfoul andperversenatures is a central part of the anti-porncampaign.The middle classes get to say what can be safely seen because they believethemselvesintelligentenoughto read pictures andimagesin more than one way. Anti-pornographersinsist thatworkingclass men areincapable of seeing sexualimageswithout being adangerto women. This paintsworkingclass men as stupidsex monsters, and reinforces the view that, sexually, men are “allpotential rapists.” Infactso potential that aglance at sex in a movie or anakedwomanona page will sendthemallout to rape and abuse, or will damagetheir souls forever.It is a damaging, hierarchical, and sexist class society thatintroducesthe idea of sexual abuse andmalepowerand dominanceoverwomen—this is the key to exploitative attitudes andbehaviour, not pictures ofnakedadultshavingsex.When In Rome...At the turn of thecentury, excavations of Roman Pompeiiproducedwalls,doors, andcourtyardsfull of“mucky” pictures. The Victorians decided that such smutcouldn't be reconciled with what they saw as a greatcivilisation.All the finds were put into a locked room.Whenit wasfinallydecided toshowthe exhibits, the roomremained locked to “Women, children, and theuneducated.” Yousee, not much haschanged.Anymove back intime, any backsliding in the liberation ofourbodies and minds,whetherin the name ofcelebratingwomanhoodorslaggingoff promiscuity, is adefinitesteptowardsyet morerepression—andwhenrepressionis in fullswing, we lose thelittleright we havewonto makeourowndecisions and controlourlives, making informed choices.Keep PushingArgumentsoversex and sexual freedom have beenparalysingtheprogressof thefeministmovementforyears. The last thing we need are new forms of guilt for women, marchingunderthedodgyand ever-changingbannerofpoliticalcorrectness.Feminismand sexual politics have to be fundamentally about choice, controloverourlives andourbodies,and that must include sexual choice.Claimingthatallwomen are sexualvictimsdid not unite the women'smovement, it just made womenfeelscared, disempowered, and helpless. It alsodrovea wedgebetween women and menwhowanted things tochange.Avoidingsex, itscomplicationsand contradictions, itspassionandenergy, won't make any of usstrong. Itwon't help us to combat sexism either. What sidestepping the issue in the name of unity andpoliticalcorrectness does is toensurethat middle class women continue totellworkingclass women (and men) what todo—bothin and out of bed.Sex IsBrilliantIt wouldbe ahugesetback forworkingclass people to follow theconfusionsand morality that has beenforceduponus formillennia. There arestatementsabouthowweshouldbehave sexually dating back farbeyondthe Bible, and certainly thatlittlebookhas beenresponsiblefor someveryseriousrepressionofwomen, and attimes, of men, particularly gay men.Sex can be andshouldbe enjoyable forallthose taking part in it, and weshouldcertainly not besanctioned andfrowneduponif sex isourway ofearninga living, feedingourkids, andhavinga liferatherthan justsurviving.Thatdoesn't automaticallymake prostitution orpornokay—nomoreokaythanhavingto getupbeforedawnto build homes for the rich, or clean sewers, or getourbrains numbed in someproductionline or other.Neither does this make any excuses for the social fuck-upsand inadequateswhorape,molest, and abuse.Keep the JuicesFlowingSex, andenjoyingit, is natural; it's a major part ofourlives.Whenwe haveconsentingsex, withhowevermanypartners, male, female, gay, straight, or bisexual,whyshouldn't it be withpassion, pride,excitement, andexperimentation? If noone is hurt or exploited,if powerisn't usedoveranother, thenoursex is just that—ourown.It's in the interests ofallourclass to discuss sex and sexuality, to controlourownbodies, and to learnlessons about what'sgoodand what's not.Goodmedicaladvice aside, themoralists, politicians, and middleclasses havenoright tohinderus orintefere."},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"141ApologeticaPsycheroticaInMemoryofTheHappyFlowersCabalthelamentationsofThe Psycherotic Church,Pittsburghand ofThe SequelProductionCompany1998: GraduationDay17→←267→←23“Wouldthe following people please report to the principle'sofficeto besuspendedduringfinals...”The Mausoleum of Contents- Mekrön's Eulogy -Metronymathy: AConspiracyTheorist's Myth • TheBookof theObituary• TheBookof Revolution• Star Trek:NemesisAnacopyright(A) 2002, by thePsycheroticChurch, nowdefunct."},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"142Metronymathy: A ConspiracyTheorist'sMythAnArchetypalApologyinFivePartsBased onTwo(PossiblyThree)TrueStorieswrittenby Lord Chuff, MRC, KSC, tVS, LRHTheIntroductionWhenpeople write something like this, it is usually because a spirit has tappedthemontheirshoulderand startedwhispering.Not this.
