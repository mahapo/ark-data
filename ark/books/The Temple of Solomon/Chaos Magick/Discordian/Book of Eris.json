To be true to Discordia (the Latinname of our primary Goddess, Eris), I would have to say 'yes, no, and maybe'.To start with, there are scores of Discordian cabals across the world and, thanks to the Internet, Discordianwritings and ideas are proliferating. The two most famous Discordian groups are POEE and the ErisianLiberation Front. Even though many people look at the plethora of humorous writings and dismissit as areligion, Discordians take their humorous traditions very seriously. . . to a point.A tradition, or a set of traditions based around the Goddess Eris is by nature paradoxical and difficult to pindown. But it is, in my opinion, time that other Pagans realize that Eris worshippers are just as respectable as anyother group, despite the fact that we laugh at ourselves and others.History/Her Story/Eris Comes Out of Her ClosetThe foundation of the Discordian movement in modern times comes from the paradoxical writing collectionknown as the \"Principia Discordia, or How I found the Goddess and what I did with Her when I found Her. \" Ittells the story of two young men in a bowling alley who receive the first Erisian Revelation back in 1957 or 58.(In true Discordian fashion, which year is never cleared up. ) The men go on a search of mythologies anddiscover Eris, the Goddess of Confusion, Chaos, and Discord. (Eris is also the Greek word for 'strife'. ) Theysurmised that chaos underlies everything, including order and the followers of order. \"Look around and you cansee all of the chaos in everything just as much as you can see order. \" The two men declare themselves to beHigh Priests of their own madness and start a Discordian Society \"for whatever that may turn out to be. \"The explosion of the American counter-culture and the revival of surrealism met Discordianism (1960's and70's) and the result was a Neo-Pagan parody religion of mirth and laughter. During this time the two maingroups of the Discordian Society, POEE 'the Paratheo-Anametamystikhood of Eris Esoteric' and the ErisianLiberation Front set down the major practices and ideas that have since influenced later groups of Discordians,most of which were included in later editions of the Principia Discordia. It can also be said (although, manypeople will argue against this) that the post-modern magical phenomenon of Chaos Magic developed underDiscordian influences. The main difference between Discordians and Chaos Mages is that Discordians reverethe Goddess Eris, whereas Chaos Mages revere whatever works at the moment. Discordian thought runs a fullspectrum from believers in a literal Goddess Eris to those who hold a healthy agnosticism towards all gods.Today there are several active Discordian groups known as 'cabals' which continue to develop and practiceDiscordian ideas and rituals. POEE is still around, although it is debated whether or not the ELF still exists.Some of the active groups today are the Church of No Dead Saints in San Francisco, the Discordian IntelligenceAgency, which is scattered in places as far afield as Australia, Germany, and Pennsylvania, and the Purple"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Monkey Mafia/Cabal which started in Chicago but claims to have members in LA, Paris, and Seattle. There aremany other groups, too numerous to list here. (Please refer to the list of website links below. )The organization of the groups within the Discordian Society (or without, as some groups will no doubt claim)is decentralized. Usually people will either join a pre-existing cabal, or if Eris decides to give new revelations,will start their own cabal. Within cabals there is usually an 'episkopos', who is responsible for the rituals,revelations, and organization. Thus it can be said that each cabal may choose its own organization. The majortrend is towards non-hierarchy as episkoposes are known to hand off the leadership mantle whenever they seefit.Beliefs? Standards of Conduct?One of the main tenets of Discordianism is that 'it is a firm belief that it is a mistake to hold firm beliefs'. Thatsaid, it is possible (though highly disagreeable) to pin down a few ideas that are common among Discordians.One is a dedication to personal 'illumination' by exploring as many belief systems as possible so that a personwill realize the absurdity of taking any idea too far. Another idea is 'if it makes you cry, it is real; if it makesyou laugh, then it is probably true. 'Discordians worship Eris, who is probably the most paradoxical being people could ever worship. If they don'tworship Her then they explore Her in some way or another. They see in Her a symbol of freedom from allconstraints and a license to become the best person one can be. Why should the self be limited to circumstancesof birth and upbringing, or even a single ego? Eris was much maligned and feared by the ancients as theembodiment of disorder. But from a perspective that sees chaos as underlying everything, Eris is anembodiment of ultimate creativity. All things need to come apart for new things to grow.Most Discordians will refer to the story known as the 'Original Snub' which explains a little bit about Eris. Inthis story, the Olympians assembled at a feast on Mount Olympus (called Limbo Peak by Discordians). Theydecide not to invite Eris due to Her reputation for causing chaos and strife. When Eris finds this out, Shedecides to get even with the Olympians by making a golden apple and carving the word 'kallisti' (to theprettiest) on its side. She sneaks up to the banquet hall and rolls the apple inside. Once the Olympians see this,they immediately set to fighting each other over who deserves the apple. From this point in the story, thevarious accounts diverge. Discordians take solace in this story whenever they themselves are snubbed. Theyalso use it as an example of active defiance in the face of unwarranted exclusion. The story begs the question 'ifEris was so bad, how come it was the rest of the Olympians who caused the commotion?' Eris can be seen, inthis light, as the one who makes you realize the inherent capacity for strife you already have. The 'OriginalSnub' is said to be the foundation myth of Discordianism, if such a thing could be said.Another approach to that myth is to see the apple as the world and all it has to offer. To whom would Eris say itbelonged? Kallisti. . . the prettiest one. And who is the prettiest one? We all are. If only we could realize it.Another important myth is the 'Curse of Grayface', which explains how people lost touch with the happyanarchy of creative chaos and become shackled to 'order'. Grayface is a humorless person who proceeds todeceive others into believing that order and seriousness should be the foundation of existence. This mythexplains the origins of negativity and destructive chaos, which according to Discordianism, can only happenwhen order is imposed. The Curse of Grayface is as much a parody of other traditions' ideas of \"what-went-wrong\" as it is a clear insight into the nature of human mentality.One thing we have in common with the very beautiful Wiccan 'Charge of the Goddess' is the most famous'Charge of Eris' which goes:"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"\"I have come to tell you that you are free. Many ages ago, My consciousness left humanity, that they mightdevelop themselves. I return to find this development approaching completion, but hindered by fear and bymisunderstanding. You have built for yourselves psychic suits of armor, and clad in them, your vision isrestricted, your movements are clumsy and painful, your skin is bruised, and your spirit is broiled in the sun. Iam chaos. I am the substance from which your artists and scientists build rhythms. I am the spirit with whichyour children and clowns laugh in happy anarchy. I am chaos. I am alive, and I tell you that you are free. \"To Eris worshippers, this is as evocative to us as the Charge of the Goddess is to Wiccans. With a charge sopowerful, one can probably glimpse why anyone would become a Discordian.Discordians focus on disorder, which is symbolized by the golden apple with kallisti written on it, as acorrective for society's emphasis on order. But we don't forget that since chaos underlies everything then orderis also an expression of chaos. Our symbol for that order is a pentagon. The two symbols placed within a yin-yang type background make up what we call the Sacred Chao [kao or 'cow']. The Sacred Chao symbolizes thenecessity of both order and disorder as expressions of creativity. When in balance, we call it the Hodge-Podge.\"To choose order over disorder, or disorder over order, is to accept a path composed of both the creative andthe destructive. But to choose the creative over the destructive is an all-creative path composed of both orderand disorder. To accomplish this, one need only accept creative disorder along with, and equal to, creativeorder, and also be willing to reject destructive order as an undesirable equal to destructive disorder. \" (PD)Those Eris worshippers who have their own profound experiences with Eris, either through revelations, visions,or divine inspiration, take the letters KSC after their names to signify \"Keeper of the Sacred Chao. \" KSC's sailthe seas of chaotic thoughts, magic's and emotions while providing illumination to their fellow Discordians, ifthey wish. They are Eris's special group of crazy adherents. KSC's are often the catalysts of cabals and manyhappen to be the sort of people who can practice Discordian magic and get results. They also tend to be moreesoteric and steeped in 'chaosophy' than most, but communion with Eris will do that.There is also the widespread notion of the five stages, which is another expression of the ubiquitous 'law offives' in Discordian thought. This idea is much like the 'aeonics' idea expressed within Chaos Magic (and theyprobably got the idea from us). The five stages are used to help understand and explain socio-historicaldevelopments. The First stage is Chaos, in which everything is in its natural state. Order and disorder are indynamic balance. Organization occurs naturally. Authoritarian people hate this stage. It is like Hegel's thesis. Itis the start and finish of every society. (Corresponding deity = Eris. ) The second stage is Discord, which startswith the appearance of ruling classes and governance. Authority becomes the main organizer of systems and ofbeliefs. It is Hegel's antithesis. The underclasses discover that its interests are not the same as the rulers. Societyis thus divided. The third stage is Confusion, in which some attempt is made to restore balance or achieve asynthesis. It is an attempt to restore nature through unnatural means. Intuition is mistrusted. People try to breakfree of authoritarian ideas by using those same ideas. Every revolution becomes a mirror of what it overthrows.The forth stage is Bureaucracy, what we call the 'parenthesis' that Hegel missed, in which the synthesis doesnot reconcile the opposites. Society is exhausted, while appearing to be thriving. Ideas and rules have becomemore important than the people who create them. Superior people are ruled by idiocy. The fifth stage is theAftermath, and represents the drift back to chaos. It is a transitional period where many people, in desperationor hope, turn to intuition and magic in order to rediscover their natures. Bureaucracy has collapsed under itsown weight of intellectual ideas and 'paperwork'. Each one of these stages also has correspondences withdeities, tarot cards, planets, the zodiac, elements, and more. They would be too numerous to list here. Butanyone can find them in the PD or in the Illuminatus! Trilogy.Some Discordian practices include the universalization of pope-hood - every now and then declaring that everyhuman being is an authentic pope. (We also have mome-hood for those who want that. ) Discordians often liketo canonize themselves and others, and you will find many saint names among us. When cabals gather for ritual,the only thing that can be assured is that all traditions are fair game and will be used in humorous ways. The"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Principia Discordia includes some of the more well known rituals. One practice that may be of interest tomagical operators is the use of laughter in banishing.In terms of conduct, Discordians adhere to the Chaoist idea that 'nothing is true and everything is permissible. 'It sounds like a blanket endorsement for any sort of behavior. Even so, it is said that some religions preach love,compassion, law, and forgiveness but result in hatred, disorder and destruction. Discordianism preaches chaos,confusion, and disorder, and results in love, creativity, freedom, and laughter. The reason why an ethic of'everything is permissible' works within Discordianism is the ultimate respect given to the individual to workout their own approach to Eris. We do not believe in manipulating people or even trying to control theirexpressions, even if they disagree with us. And this idea comes from the idea that we are all free right now. Ifthis sounds like anarchy, you may be right. . . maybe.Ways of Worship/RitualLaughter and paradox are essential in worshiping Eris. One of the ways we worship Eris is by engaging in'guerrilla mind' tricks - making paradoxical flyers to distribute, posting esoterica in unlikely places, counter-evangelism, surrealist pranking, ontological trickery, giving absurd rewards to distinguished individuals, etc.We believe that such things are essential to someone on any honest spiritual path. Laughter opens minds morethan anything else can. Laughter is also one of the best ways to worship. Why wouldn't your Goddesses/Godswish to see you having a rip-roaring good time?Another way we worship Her is to design our own rituals, on the fly - and they had better be good rituals, Erishelp us - in which we mimic or parody other more 'serious' traditions. Due to the nature of Discordianism, therituals are at the whim of the moment. Often, no two rituals are the same. What the rituals lack in continuity,they make up for in creativity, and usually, though not always; cabals will have organically developed sets ofrituals which fit the participants and Eris just fine.The magical tools we use in rituals more often depend upon the idiosyncrasies of the episkopos than on anytradition. Sacred forks may replace athames for circle casting. Five quarters may be called instead of four. Fordivination, we may use TV screens to scry as readily as black plates or crystal balls. For incense we may burnclove cigarettes. Sometimes we cast no circles and at other times we may cast differently shaped sacred spots. Ifthis appears silly, that is the main point. Another point is that people should learn to work rituals with any or notools. Discordian ritual and worship is really about incorporating everything around you and being always readyto so.HolidaysThis is probably the easiest aspect of Discordianism to describe as it is pretty much clear for Discordians even ifthey seemingly argue over its importance. All religious traditions have their own set calendars andDiscordianism is no exception.The year is broken down into five seasons named after the five stages, each one having a patron from thelegendary five Erisian Apostles from history - Chaos, Discord, Confusion, Bureaucracy, and the Aftermath - of73 days each. The patrons are Hung Mung, Dr. Van Van Mojo, Sri Sayadasti, Zarathud, and the ElderMalaclypse. There are five-day weeks in which the days are named thus: Sweetmorn, Boomtime, Pungenday,Prickle-Prickle, and Setting Orange. Both the seasons and the five-day weeks are in keeping with the law offives that Discordians favor. The five Discordian elements are sweet, boom, pungent, prickle, and orange. Thefives also stand for the five elements (four plus spirit) so common in other Neo-Pagan traditions. If you notice,the weekday names each reference a particular physical sense and Discordians tend to meditate on the particularsense that the name refers to. It can be said that the Discordian calendar is the easiest yet most profound thingfor outsiders to grasp."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Special holidays occur. Apostle Holydays, named after the five legendary Erisian apostles, occur on the fifthday of each season. So we have Mungday, Mojoday, Syaday, Zaraday, and Maladay. On each one of these days,Discordians celebrate the aspects of the apostle who most embodied that season. On the 50th day of eachseason, there are holydays which celebrate the aspects of the season itself - Chaoflux, Discoflux, Confuflux,Bureflux, and Afflux. Each cabal tends to celebrate the holydays in different ways. In practice, manyDiscordians also borrow some more holidays from the broader Neo- Pagan community such as Samhain.Those many Discordians who use the calendar date it from theOriginal Snub said to have taken place around 3169 years ago, at the time of this writing. So 2003 = 3169. Andtrue to the spirit of Discordianism, not everyone uses this calendar.Context Within the Broader Neo-Pagan CommunityMany Discordians are also practitioners of other traditions such as Wicca, or variations of Witchcraft. Erisworshippers, such as me, also have other deities. Some are even members of other religions such as Buddhism -Zen is a particular favorite, and sometimes Discordianism is described as a laugh happy Pagan Zen. Many of themajor Neo- Pagan traditions of today started off as parodies and/or eclectic rip-offs of other occult traditions,and Discordianism is no exception. The major difference is that with a Goddess such as Eris, and with sacredscriptures that are absurd, Discordianism tends to stay humorous and non-dogmatic and this spirit does flowthrough other Neo-Pagan traditions as manifested in play and mirth.While many practitioners of Chaos Magic do not consider themselves Pagans (though it doesn't stop them fromstealing Pagan traditions), those of a Discordian flavor will be more likely to refer to themselves as such. Not allDiscordians consider themselves to be practitioners of Chaos Magic, but many of the foundations of today'sChaos Magic were laid by the Discordian Society. Though it is extremely tempting to claim Chaos Magic to bea Discordian offshoot, it might be more helpful to think of the two paths as 'lovers'.Discordianism can be said to be henotheistic, meaning that one Goddess is worshipped primarily but not to theexclusion of other deities' existences. There are many Discordians who are also polytheists and see the 'Upstartof One Hand Clapping' in many of the other deities.This description is really a brief one and in no way could hope to capture the full spectrum of Discordianism. Itis hoped that those who would like further information about the vast realm of Discordian esoterica and eristicawill consult either some of the sites listed below or their own pineal glands. If you think that Discordianism isjust a bunch of silly craziness that makes no sense, then you probably need to look again. If you think thatDiscordianism is terribly confusing, we may have more in common than you think. If you think thatDiscordianism is something-or-other but can't quite grasp it, hail Eris, you may understand.[Setting Orange, Aftermath 13th, 3169/Saturday, November 1st, 2003/Samhain]\"The human race will begin solving its problems on the day that it ceases taking itself so seriously. \" -PrincipiaDiscordia\"Humanity is a giant forced to live in a pygmy's hut.

The impressively and self-named Malaclypse the Younger (or Mal-2) is really Greg Hill and the equallyimpressively and also self-named Omar Khayyam Ravenhurst is really Kerry Thornley. Both had little better to do around 1958 than to have a good old whinge and gripe at any and all establishedestablishments and they were both in agreement that everything, and they meant everything, was a just anunhappy mixture of controlled chaos and falsely imposed order. One day they were pondering this very paradox at a bowling ally in Whittier, California when things gotseriously weird. In one of those blinding-light-moments Greg and Kerry stopped chatting long enough todiscover that everyone else in the bowling hall appeared to be frozen in time. Which led our two heroes to theunavoidable conclusion that they had been chosen to tell the world all about, well. . . a whole new world! God, they said, is actually a crazy woman by the name of Eris. Eris, you remember, was the-god-not-invited-to-the-wedding-feast. Turning up anyway she threw in the apple of confusion that started an ungodlyspat between Aphrodite, Athena and Hera that gave rise, ultimately, to the first war between men; The TrojanWar. And quite appropriately Erisí Law states that chaos is increased when order is imposed [See The Law ofEristic Escalation above] and Chaos, says the Discordians in the Great Scheme Of Things, is every bit asimportant as Order. For Discordians the world around them is governed by chance, opportunity, and indiscriminate accidents, inshort, chaos and any ëorderí imposed is merely an exercise in containment and in all likelihood, doomed tofailure. The Principia Discordia is the Bible of Discordianism and having got into the twenty first century andevolved through five editions there is no indication of its early demise. Five is a good number for the Discordians and the Pentabarf gives five laws for all good Discordians tofollow or ignore as they see fit. These cover the good news that Hot Dogs Are Good On Fridays and that allgood Discordians are Actually Prohibited From Believing Anything They Read. The symbol adopted by the Discordians is based on the older Yin-Yang shapes-within-a-circle but instead ofthe teardrop and eye shape they have a pentagram (that five sided figure again) and Erisís famous applerepresenting the continuing relationship between chaos and order. The non-Discordians who still insist on poking fun at the Discordian cause (and that is just about everybody)put forward the argument that ërealityí is, well, real and to say that there are different kinds of reality is simplycrazy. But as just about everyone had different ideas of ërealityí the boys needed no more proof. It was all theother people who were crazy. The word and concept of ërealityí was (and still is) the main talking point of Discordian philosophy. Ifreality comes from the culture that surrounds us then it follows that given any particular subject, differentcultures would have a totally different view of it."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":" Which is a fact so obvious that it seems to have escaped the attention of even the brightest and best of thecontrollers and policy makers whose job it is to contain all that chaos. But it hasn't escaped the Discordians. Real reality, say the Discordians, goes deeper that a subjective view ofthe world through a one small window of perception. Each view from that narrow and somewhat opaque window shows more the reflection of the viewer than theview. No one view is more ërealí than another and the greatest problems occur when one view is forcefullyimposed upon another. Another blindingly obvious observation that, again, appears to have escaped the politicians and lawmakers. The fact is that the real view from the big clear window shows both natural order and natural chaos existswhether anyone likes it or not. These natural events can be seen in everything from biological growth to geological evolution and whileviruses and volcanoes can bring both chaos and order, it is merely our perception of the results that makes thedifference between stability and confusion. Understanding does not necessarily bring control. Understanding just brings, well, understanding. And now every time a Discordian joke is told there should be a slight shiver of agreement.

The Christians have their Good and their Evil. The Libertarians havetheir Rich and their Poor. And the Discordians have their Hodge and their Podge.The Hodge and Podge are the two sides of the Universe: the Hodge being chaotic and Eristic, and the Podgebeing orderly and Aneristic. They are represented in the Sacred Chao, in which a pentagon signifies the Podgeand a Golden Apple the Hodge, and are in constant turmoil; although one side can occasionally gain atemporary victory, neither will ever defeat the other. Thus in history, the Hodge constantly overpowers thePodge, and the Podge then responds and overpowers the Hodge in its turn. According to the Honest Book ofTruth, this is the Eristic Pattern, which \"will repeat itself Five Times over Seventy Three Times, after whichnothing will happen. \"As of the present, the Podge is highly ascendent, and just about everyone, from politicians to cardinals totelevangelists to various other crazies thinks that the way to solve the world's problems is to introduce evenMORE order. Most of the so-called counterestablishment and even most of the people who are going on and onabout freedom believe this in a slightly different sense. From the Podge grows bureacracy, rather pointless laws,the ascendency of organized religion, the Objectivist Movement, and most branches of calculus. The all-time(literally) champions of the Podge are the Bavarian Illuminati.On the other hand, there are those who realize that the situation must be brought back into balance byintroducing some good, old-fashioned chaos, which will lead to freer thinking, less orthodoxy and dogmatism,more expanded minds, and and a less hilariously inefficient society.

Most people, blissfully unaware of this law,attempt to impose order anyway, with comical results. The most dedicated, such as Confucius, are consideredEristic Avatars for their trouble. Unfortunately, the Law does not work for anyone who is aware of it.The cyclic reversion of the Hodge and Podge caused by the Law of Eristic Escalation takes a distinct form,which can be divided into five seasons: Chaos, Discord, Confusion, Bureaucracy, and Aftermath.Finally, the Law of Negative Reversal states that if something does not happen then the exact opposite willhappen, only in exactly the opposite manner from that in which it did not happen.Jesus may save, but only Eris gives you a 23 percent return on your investmentIMPORTANT TIP:For best reception, make sure you clean out your pineal gland at least once a month.DISCORDIA THE BEAUTIFULOh beautiful, on starlit skiesAs frogs begin to rain!For purple dinosaurs, BarneyWith Chaos on the brain!DISCORDIA!DISCORDIA!!,Eris shine thy grace on me!!!And crown my wood,with Robin HoodFrom Earl Grey to Chamomile Tea!!!St. Rufus the Uncouth asks: \"If this is tourist season, how come we'renot allowed to shoot them?\"It wasn't me.

Many attempts havefailed.Discordianism is a philosophy. Some have described it as \"like Taoism, but funnier. \" Some people think thatDiscordians take serious things humorously. That is not quite true; rather, we take humorous things seriously.Discordianism has a lot to do with Order and Disorder(which is what Chaos uses to manifest itself onto thematerial plane. The two are considered equals, more or less. Discordianism isn't about anarchy, the downfall ofgovernment, and breaking stuff, per se. It's about creativity, and that takes both Order and Disorder. To quotethe Principia Discordia (most wholely holy of texts; the Better Book), \"To choose order over disorder, ordisorder over order, is to accept a trip composed of both the creative and the destructive. But to choose thecreative over the destructive is an all-creative trip composed of both order and disorder. To accomplish this,one need only accept creative disorder along with, and equal to, creative order, and also be willing to rejectdestructive order as an undesirable equal to destructive disorder. \" One camp of Discordians believes there isenough order in the world as it is, and so dedicate themselves to being founts of chaos, thus evening up theoverall balance. Another camp takes things more personally, and so looks to strike a balance between orderand disorder within the individual. They're both right. ERIS\"Seek me not without. Seek me not within. \"-Eris\"People are afraid to forget their minds, fearing to fall through the emptiness with nothing to hold them. Theydo not know that emptiness is not really emptiness, but the realm of real dharma. \"-Huang PoYour feelings of emptiness will stop overtaking you once you learn to stop taking them so personally. Why dowe often ruin that which we most need? Because our fears about our emptiness cause us to cling tightly to thethings and people we feel will stave off the emptiness. Trying to stop the inherent chaos of life is like trying tostop your blood from flowing. You call upon Eris, yet you maintain the right to have some sense of order andstability in your life? Ha! Just you wait. She'll take your latent feelings of emptiness and blast your mind openwith them. And as you cower and shake with fear after crossing that abyss (and let's face it kiddies, the abysswill, as any experienced occultist will tell you, scare the living crap out of you and anyone who says otherwiseis either lying or New Aged), you will hear Eris laughing as the bubbles of all your pretensions are popped. Notbecause She is a bitch, though there is that, but because She handed you freedom on a silver platter, and youdidn't see it. So now you get to achieve it the hard way. But, if it makes you feel any better, in time this will allseem funny to you. It could be worse, Eris could have you join the Discordian Society or something.Eris?

But it is your fault for carrying all thatcrap inside anyway. If you want to complain about it, too bad. She's not listening to your babble. Go start acause or something. And if you should happen to believe that you know what Discordianism is, then the joke ison you, silly dupes. It's not about freedom. It's not about slavery. It's not about being cool, chic, avant garde, orbetter than the so-called political people. It's not about this. It's not about that. It starts with Eris. All the rest isin your head.

The greatest proponants of the Aneristic theory have been the Illuminati, who have existed for all time,and were also formed in 1776 as the Bavarian Illuminated Adepts.

They may or maynot have been founded in ancient Atlantis, and are as likely as not to have supervised the construction of theGreat Pyramid of Egypt. Hassan i-Sabbah of the Assassins likely had a high-rank in their organization. Themost important Illuminatus of modern times was Adam Weishaupt, a Primus Illuminatus who rebuilt the Orderfrom the ground up and officially rededicated it in 1776. After running into a few technical difficulties inBavaria, he moved to America, where he masqueraded as George Washington with astounding success, evenmanaging to be made the first President. Ever since his death, the United States has been a center for Illuminatioperations, particularly small towns in Texas (not that we're implying anything!)The Illuminati are actually rather easy to find, once you know what to look for.

Archimedes, one of the greatest intellects of antiquity, used this expression(literally \"I have found it!\") when he figured out how to determine the purity of gold objects.We get closer to this eureka moment when the study of Chaos changes us and gives us a new way to examinethe world. This transformed perspective lets us take something ordinary and familiar, and suddenly see in it allsorts of interesting new insights.For example, let's take a glass and fill it with water to the halfway point. We then ask the customary, time-honored question, \"Is the glass half empty or half full?\"Haven't we all seen this a zillion times? What new insights can we possibly squeeze out of this tired oldplatitude?As we all know, the glass serves as a metaphor for life, and water represents the good things in it. So, seeing theglass as half empty means you're a pessimist, because you dwell on the lack in your life. Seeing it as half fullmeans you're optimistic, because you focus on the good things in life. Most people choose the latter anddescribe themselves as optimists. In all likelihood, this means you, too.Notice an interesting social phenomenon here. Most people want to be seen as optimists, even those who areusually morose and glum. Aren't we just a planet full of upbeat, sunny cheerleaders? How interesting! Why dowe have such a social pressure to be relentlessly optimistic?Let's look at it from a completely different angle and turn this paradigm upside down. Is it always a negativething to see the glass as half empty? Suppose such a perception motivates you to fill the glass - so to speak -whereas seeing it as half full leads to complacency. Focusing on the lack in one's life can then be a driving forcefor success. Not so negative now, is it?Look at the overachievers who accomplish great things in any field. They probably started out life with the ideathat there wasn't enough water in their glass to suit them, so they worked to fill it up. On the other hand, at theopposite end of the spectrum, we have the underachievers who dawdle away their lives in torpid passivity.Perhaps they do so because their focus is on what they already possess, rather than the areas of life that can usesome improvement.Another similar idea is to recognize the inherent usefulness of emptiness. In chapter 11 of Tao Te Ching, LaoTzu makes the point that the emptiness of a cup gives it utility and function. The lower part of the glass that isalready filled with water cannot accept another drop, and if we remind ourselves that this represents life, wequickly see that the empty portion is where all the action can take place.The Taoist/Chaoist concept of emptiness is not a vacuous state of nothingness; rather, it is a pregnant voidbursting with potentialities. Now we can see how this makes perfect sense. The blank pages in the book of yourlife are where the continuing tale of your adventures will be written. These empty pages are the place whereunlimited possibilities exist. It's where the excitement and the joie de vivre reside.The emptiness is the part that can hold more water (good things). It is what makes the glass (life) useful andfunctional. So why wouldn't we want to focus on it? When you think of it this way, doesn't it seem a little oddthat most people choose to see the glass as half full instead of half empty?"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"See what's going on here? Even though most of us have heard about the glass half filled with water many, manytimes, in all likelihood it has never occurred to us that we can switch the positive and negative perceptionsaround so easily. Evidently there's more to the glass than meets the eyes.We also need to examine the unspoken assumptions and see how valid they really are. For instance, we start outwith the unwritten, assumed rule that we have two choices, half full or half empty, and we must choose one ofthem. But must we really? Does it really have to be one or the other? Why can it not be both, or neither?Indeed, a glass with water at the halfway point can be seen as both half empty and half full. Sometimes it isuseful to think of it one way; other times it's better to see it the other way. This is a completely accuratedescription of reality, and probably a much better way to conceptualize it than to arbitrarily force it into onecategory or another. By recognizing that the glass can embody both descriptions simultaneously, we begin todeal with it from a holistic mindset, taking into account every aspect of the object.In this mindset, we can see that asking about the glass being half full or half empty is just like asking about thenature of light. Is light composed of particles or waves? Well, the true answer is that light embodies propertiesof both particles and waves. Sometimes it is useful to think of it one way; other times it's better to see it theother way. This is a completely accurate description of reality, and probably a much better way to conceptualizeit than to arbitrarily force it into one category or another.Now let's look at the flip side. How can we say that the glass is neither half full nor half empty? First, we notethat both descriptions can only be perfectly accurate in theory, and never in reality. When you pour water intothe glass, no matter how careful you are and what precision tools you use, you will never hit the exact halfwaymark. If you are very lucky, you can get to the point where you're only a few molecules off, over or under.Thus, the glass is never truly half full or half empty. Its state can only be described approximately.The second factor is the Chaoist concept of constant change. Nothing remains static. Nothing. As soon as anywater gets into the glass, evaporation begins. At any given moment, the glass is releasing water molecules intothe air. In fact, if we wait long enough, the glass won't just be half empty - it will be empty, period!For some of us, the water goes away even more quickly, because we have imperfect glasses with hairlinefractures, where water seeps out at an alarming rate. This means the good things in our lives never seem to last.You manage to get a great job, only to be downsized; you buy a new car, only to discover it's a lemon; and soon.In the face of this dynamism, where the only question is how quickly water goes away, we need to take action.If we remain inactive, then it's a certainty that the good things in life will soon disappear, never to return. Whatwe want is a constant stream of incoming water to replenish the water lost to evaporation and possible leakage.Let's explore a little further. What does the glass look like from a Zenarchist perspective?Zen Discordianism recognizes the illusory nature of reality and the ultimate emptiness of the material world.Thus, when confronted with the choice of half empty or half full, the Zen Discordianismt may answer \"neither,\" because the water doesn't really exist, nor does the glass.This may seem far out, but in at least two respects the Zenachist practitioner is right. First, both the glass andwater are transient. We have already noted that the water will eventually be gone, either when the glass breaks(the end of your life) or before. The glass may last somewhat longer than the water, but we know it willeventually be shattered into pieces and no longer exist as a container. Like the ephemeral flame of a candle, lifeflickers into existence for a while, and then gets snuffed out without much fanfare. In truth, it can claim no morepermanent reality than the candle flame."},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"The second factor affirming the Zenarchist perspective is our understanding of the most fundamental level ofreality, as revealed through quantum physics. At the sub-atomic level, we see that what we think of as solidmatter is mostly empty space. The solidity of matter that we perceive is merely the macroscopic manifestationof energy and information patterns. In this perspective, the water is indeed illusory, and so is the glass.Now that we have sampled the Zenachist perspective, we will naturally want to explore the Chaoist perspectiveas well. This is an interesting challenge in view of everything we have talked about so far. We seem to have leftno stone unturned in discussing all the different ways we can approach the glass. What other insight can theSacred Chaos provide us that hasn't already been said? How can a true Discordian sage answer the question in away that transcends all other answers on the subject?The sage does not answer. Instead, he takes the glass, drinks from it, and relishes the thirst-quenching andrefreshing water. He puts the glass back down and remains quiet, perhaps with a smile on his face, as othersscramble to revise their estimation from half full to quarter full, or half empty to three-quarters empty.The sage knows that the essence of life is to be lived, not debated. The glass and water serve one purposeadmirably well, and that is to slake thirst. Trying to decide if it is half full or half empty does absolutely nothingto further that purpose. If anything, it gets in the way and delays the ultimate objective of drinking fully anddeeply.Eris is beyond mere words. Discussing the glass can never replace the experience of drinking from it; describingthe various perspectives will never get you closer to the actual act of savoring the water. Thus, the sage wastesno effort on intellectualization; he cuts to the chase.Eureka!"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"ERIS SETS US FREE\"I have come to tell you that you are free.

I awoke to find myself walking hand-in-hand with the Mother-of-Us-All toward a beautiful Playground, aplayground that seemed to stretch to infinity. She brought me to the gate, gave me a big hug and a kiss, and saidunto me, \"This is your playground, do as thou wilt, and have a good time. \"I nervously walked through thegates, and was amazed at all the sights and sounds. There were monkey bars, slides, toys, sprinklers, and alltypes of fun goodies, as far as the eyes can see. There were also many, many children of all different shapes andsizes playing through out the Playground.I explored my surroundings for a while, and made a few friends. All around me children were playing and doingmany things(as children are want to to). Some children played by themselves, and some played with many kids.Some only had one or two playmates, and some had none. There were even a few who didn't want to play at all,and said that playing was bad. Sometime some of the kids would steal the toys from the other kids, and otherswould hog all the toys around them. Some even shared their toys with others.All around me, children were running and jumping, laughing and singing, loving and fighting. Some kids wouldstay in the playground for a while, and some had to leave as soon as they got there. Sometimes fights wouldbreak out amongst the children, often for silly reasons. Some children had too many toys to play with, and somehad none. Some of the kids would section off a part of a playground, and wouldn't let any one else play there.Bullies would roam the park picking on the weaker kids. Many games were play in the playground. Some of thegames were: cops and robbers, war, hospital, convert the heathens , feed the poor , get a good job, etc.I noticed a bunch of kids in the middle of a heated discussion, so I decided to see what was going on. Idiscovered that the children were discussing the nature of the playground. Some children said that this is theonly playground there is, while others said there are an infinite amount of playgrounds. Some argued that thissection of the playground was the only section to have children playing , and others say that there are manysections with many children in it. Some say that when you leave the playground you never come back, andsome say that you come back over and over again. I didn't get involve in that discussion, because I knew better.In another discussion pool, the kids were talking about the Mother-of-Us-All. Some said she didn't exist, somesaid she did. A few of the kids believed that there was no Mother-of-Us-All, only the Father existed. Somebelieved that there were many Mothers and Fathers. And some of us believed that She is All-in-One, and One-in-All. There were kids who said that if you do not play the way they said that Mother/Father wants you to play,you will go to a very, very BAD place when you leave the playground. I found a few who truly loved theMother, and said to them, \"hey guys, lets just play\".Every once in a while Mother would call out the name of a child and tell them it was time to go home. Somechildren would scream and cry and throw temper tantrums, but to no avail. When Mom said it was time to go, itwas time to go. I decided to really enjoy my stay in the playground. I played with many kids, had manyadventures, had run-ins with bullies, scraped my knees a few times, and generally had the time of my life. Aftera while, I grew very tired and sleepy, and I knew it was soon time for Mother to call my name. I put my toysaway, and called all my playmates together for one last game of tag. When the game ended, I head Mother callmy name. I bid my playmates farewell, and told them not to cry, we will all play together again someday. I ranout off the park and into Mothers waiting arms. I placed my head on her bosom and said. \"Thank you Mom, Ihad a great time in the Playground\". She just smiled at me gave me a kiss on the forehead, and I fell asleep inher arms.I awoke to find myself walking hand-in-hand with the Mother-of-Us-All toward a beautiful Playground, aplayground that seemed to stretch to infinity. . . ."},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"\"Above is St. Gulik.

Dr. Hellbreath would constantly berate Rev. Verthaine on his love of ERIS. The Professorwould constantly tell him that Satan is more powerful that ERIS, and that black magick is far superior to chaosmagick. After enduring an entire semester of such abuse, our young Verthaine had decided he had had enough.After a particularly nasty tirade against Discordian magick by Dr. Hellbreath, the young Verthaine stood up,held a golden apple in his hand and said that he could counter any spell the Professor could throw at him. As ahush fell upon the lecture hall, the professor chuckled and produced a worn copy of the accursedNECRONOMICON, and proceeded to draw some archaic symbols on the floor. He spoke words long forgotten,and the air shimmered above the lecture hall. The air began to stink of raw sewage, but still the professorchanted. A rip began to form in the Time-Space Continuum. As the professor was about to speak the finalsentences that would release the Lovecraftian horror and seal Verthaine's doom, the good Reverend looked atthe apple in his hand, folded up the chair he was sitting on, and tossed it at the professor's head. The professorwas just about to say the final words freeing the ancient eldritch horror from the protective sigil he created whenthe flying chair connected, knocking him out. And after the Inter-dimensional horror (angered that it wasprevented from truly entering our realm due to the unconsciousness of the professor) dragged the unfortunateDr. Hellbreath back into it hellish netherworld, the young Verthaine took a bite out of the golden apple, placedit on the late professors desk, lit a joint and said: \"Spell countered\".GREYFACEIn the year 1166 B.

Man hasbeen on a bad trip for a long time now.It is called THE CURSE OF GREYFACE.The \"Real\" Story Of GreyfaceIt was actually the year 11660 B. C. , during the Golden age of Atlantis, that one of the most celebratedscientists, Graud the Greyface (so called because he was born without fur), got it into his head that Order wasmore preferable to Chaos, and that mankind needed laws. He convinced some of his fellow scientists to create areligion, one that would replace the Goddess(Chaos) worship with the worship of the Sun God( Order). Heclaimed that Mankind must follow his rules and laws. He created the concepts of \"GOOD\" and \"EVIL\". Hetaught his followers that anything he believed in was \"GOOD\" (sex for procreating only, obeying authority, etc)and anything else as Evil (enjoying sex, questioning authority, etc. ). Greyface tried to enact legislation makinghis beliefs the only ones allowed in Atlantis, but was rebuffed by his own lover Lilith Velkor, the daughter of aprominant Elder, who realized that Graud was going insane, and would soon be a threat to every one.Undaunted, Greyface continued to grow in power, and his former lover Lilith created the Discordian Society tocombat Greyface's organization, now named THE ILLUMINATI. They took the Eye in the Pyramidas their symbol, representing Man's creation of Law and Order in the Universe. In one of the firstclashes between Graud's fascist fanatics, and Lilith's freedom-fighters, one of the Council Elders was killed(secretly by Greyface himself). Graud framed Lilith and had her crucified on a upside down Y-beam. TheDiscordians therefore adopted Liliths Y-beam as a symbol of peace.With Lilith's death, the Discordians fought with renewed vigor. Greyface, in his madness, decided to destroyAtlantis, hoping to wipe out the Discordians, and finally take over the world unopposed.

Eris and Aneris looked upon it and saw that it was boring.\"Yawn, \" Eris yawned. \"Aneris, My sister, the Earth is truly uninteresting. Let's liven it up somehow. \" Eris, theGoddess of Chaos, was always eager to disturb stable systems.\"I like it this way, Eris. \" Aneris, the Goddess of non-Chaos, was much more conservative. \"Boring things aremore orderly. \"\"Aww, pleeeeease?\" Eris was not above whining.There was some arguing back and forth, and eventually They came to an agreement that They would bring forthlife to alleviate the boredom. So Eris and Aneris descended upon the Earth.\"Let there be life!\" said Aneris, and there was life. Plant life. Ferns. Trees. Mushrooms. Lichen. Anerislooked about and said, \"See! It's much more colorful now. \"Eris sighed. \"You call this life? It's almost as boring as before! These things just grow and die and wave in thewind. Here, let Me try. \" And Eris lifted up the clay from the ground and formed it into the shape of an ant. Sheblew upon it and it scurried off to build a hill.\"Animals? Sure, We can make some of those. \" And Eris and Aneris began to create animals. First Theycreated the simpler animals, like the insects and worms and such. Then They went on to the reptiles and birdsand such. Finally, They started on the mammals.By this time, They had a pretty good system going. Aneris would create the female animal, then Eris wouldcome along and create the male. When Aneris made the first female mammals with fur and nipples, Eris saw achance to have some fun. As She made the furry male mammals, She gave them their own, useless, nipples.Aneris looked over at Her sister every once in a while, but since the fur hid the nipples She didn't see anythingbut Eris's wide smile. Aneris, naturally, got suspicious. . . She knew from experience that Eris could not betrusted when She was smiling. (Or at any other time, for that matter. )Shrugging, Aneris started creating the first woman. She made her after Her own image, with heavy hair on herhead but not as much elsewhere. And She gave women nipples, which were quite visible from the lack of hair."},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"Eris followed along, creating the first man. She gave him hair on his head, and not as much elsewhere. AndShe gave him the same useless nipples all the other male mammals had. Aneris looked over and saw what hadhappened.\"Wha-at?!\", Aneris screamed. \"Have You been giving all the male mammals nipples all this time?\"Eris just doubled over, laughing.\"Damn it, Eris, whenever We make anything You always do something weird like this! Can't You take anythingseriously?\" Aneris sighed as Eris shook Her head no. \"Well, I can at least cover this up a little, \" Anerismuttered, and She put hair around men's nipples. \"There, now you can't see them so much. \" And Aneris rested,while Eris continued to roll on the floor.So to this day men have nipples, which are merely emphasized by the hair around them. Hail, She what done itall!Fact:The founders of the world's major religions were actually Discordians. Gautama Buddha, for example,expounded the Four Noble Truths and advocated living according the Noble Eightfold Path, a clear instanceof the Law of Fives in action (4 x 8 = 32, 3 + 2 = 5). Moses, the lawgiver of the Hebrews, originally received 12commandments from Yahweh, but later, under Discordian inspiration, cut them down to 10 to conform to theLaw of Fives (two tablets of five commandments each). Prominent Discordian scholars have proved that the\"secret teaching\" of Jesus, transmitted by the Gnostics, was, indeed, Discordianism (don't believe us? See foryourself). Even the acts of Jesus recorded in the exoteric Gospels provide unmistakable hints of his Discordianproclivities (changing water into wine, cursing a fig tree, picking corn on the Sabbath, etc. ) Lao Tsu, in the TaoTe Ching, says: \"Governing a large state is like boiling a small fish, \" a saying lifted directly from the Book ofUsual Suspects believed to have been written by the Erisian sage Brother Dave. The holiest city of Islam,Mecca, has five letters in its name, and Muslims are enjoined to perform five sacred duties. Shinto, the greatreligious tradition of Japan, adopted as its symbol the Five-Fingered Hand of Eris. Indeed, the only greatworld-historical religious system that seems not to have been influenced by Discordianism from its inceptionis the Church of the Attractive Blue Lighter, which began not as a religion but as a lawn care business.Beware of those who would try to convince you to convert to theirreligion. Converting someone is the act of ramming words intosomeone's ears until it comes out of their mouths.

The average person's paradigm holds that by adding more andmore order, we will eventually cancel out chaos. This kind of fuzzy wrongheaded thinking has gotten us wherewe are today. We collectively think that we can solve all of our problems by making more rules. Then wewonder why nothing works.One of the primary axioms of Discordianism is \"Imposition of Order = Escalation of Chaos. \" A minimalamount of observation will show this to be true, but unfortunately the average person is unwilling to take the"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"effort to make this observation. Rather than viewing chaos/order as simple negative/positive, let us look atanother analogy that comes closer to showing the relationship as it really exists. First, let us look at our systemas a closed box which is in a state of balance. Now, let us apply Order to the system in the form of pressure.What happens next? The pressure applied to a closed system will generate heat (Chaos). Take away pressureand the heat level drops.Of course it's easy to pick an illustration like this out of the air, but how does it apply to the dynamic betweenOrder and Chaos in a real world situation? Let's look at the closed system of the workplace, starting at a fairlyeven level of rules and freedoms. In an attempt to raise productivity and cut costs, management institutes morerules: all workers must punch in and out for break, forms must be filled out to account for all damaged orwasted materials, et cetera.In the beginning, these measures will probably do as intended, productivity may rise; attention of any sort willdo the same, but as more stringent rules are introduced, we find that two problems arise. First, a bureaucracymust be put in place to implement the new rules and make sure that they are adhered to. This takes energy awayfrom the creation of the product and directs it toward the end of making sure the rules are being followed (inphysical terms, this is energy that escapes the system as useless heat). The rules become more important thanthe original reason for them. Second (and I believe more important in the long run) the directives begin to createdissatisfaction among the workers. More time must be spent watching them to make sure that they are in placewhen they are supposed to be, making sure that time spent at their workstation is productive. As the stress fromthe situation increases, we see more lost time in the form of sick days, early departures, late arrivals and the factthe people quit caring. Creative behavior is applied to finding new ways to goof off.Of course the opposite is also true. Without sufficient rules in place and the will to enforce them, little will getdone. This surplus of chaos will require order to reach a level of balance or the company will be forced out ofbusiness. Much like the stereotypical lawless old western town, a tough lawman must be brought in to cleanthings up before the town goes up in smoke.Another prevailing assumption is that Order is Good and Chaos is Evil. In fact chaos and order exist outside ofgood and evil, but contain elements of both. Chaos is the force that tears down old forms as well as the forcethat envisions new ones. Order allows us to carry out the plans that will build the new forms, but it also wishesto preserve forms that have outlived their usefulness (the status quo). This brings up Hexar's corollary to the lawof Imposition of Order: Too much chaos, nothing gets finished. Too much order, nothing gets started.Order is what tells us that we should do whatever we can to prevent forest and brush fires. On the surface, this isa good idea because letting fire run loose is hazardous to our own lives as well as that of other living creatures.However, the fires also liberate nutrients and send them back to the earth to feed the next cycle. And we havefinally started to get it through our thick skulls that keeping things from burning at any cost only increases theamount of fuel lying around for the fire that will come when we cannot stop it. All of the small fires that weprevent come back to us as one large, devastating fire.Discordianism isn't about preaching chaos at the expense of order. It is the realization that one cannot existwithout the other. It is the acceptance of the need for balance between the two principles. Order cannot destroychaos, it can only change its form. Chaos can either be directed in creative forms, or when stifled turned intodestructive (or at least useless) forms. Energy spent clamping down can be used for nothing else.Reverend Doctor Hexar le SaipeFirst Church of the Sparkly Ball\"Putting the Disco back into Discordianism. \""},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"People in a Position to Know, Inc.THE SECRET OF THE FIVE DISCORDIANELEMENTS REVEALEDOne of the more esoteric Erisian Mysterees brought forth by Mal-2 and Omar K.

In other words, \"Do what thou wilt\" is to bidstars to shine, seeds to grow, and water to reach its own level.

We tend to be a very tolerant and fun-loving bunch of \"sacredklowners\", even as we're playing practical jokes on you like replacing your after-shave with Buck Lure.Chaos can be best described as that state of existence between what was and what will be. Chaos Magick, as aresult, is a very \"here and now\" way of looking at things. . . as a result, in typical left-handed path fashion,Discordians not to be too concerned with horoscopes, tarot, and the usual paganistic future-predicting tools.\"Every Man and Every Woman is a Star\", another Crowley-ism, suggests that as people, we control our ownfutures, not Taurus rising in Virgo (not a pretty picture) . . . to us, the notions of fatalism and pre-destination arelike giving up. Rather than CAUSING Chaos, Discordians are generally more concerned with the CONTROLof it, as Chaos (change) is one of the only true natural forces we as people can directly influence. Rituals aren'tas important as results, and magick becomes reality through the application of will, not chants and candles.However, it is important to Discordians that the mind be in the proper state to effect change, and this is oftenaccomplished through the use of music, marijuana, or other stimuli of the Magickian's preference to initiatebelief. . . Discordians theorize that belief is a central tool of magick, not a by product.Chaos Magick is perhaps one of the more \"scientific\" of pagan philosophies, sharing many of the tenants ofChaos Science, and as a result we're sometimes labeled (shudder. . we HATE labels) as being unspiritual. In away, that's true, because while we believe in the Goddess (usually. . but we reserve the right to define Her in ourown terms), we see no direct relationship between magick and morality. . . like energy, magick is neither\"black\" or \"white\", but the individual using it is responsible for it's ultimate consequences. The primary deity ofChaoticists is Eris (or Discordia), goddess of chaos, discord, and confusion. Eris can best be described as thatnatural force responsible for change, and it is the nature of things that both requires the disorganization ofexisting structures and beliefs in order to make room for newer ones. . . in this regard, Eris is responsible for lifeitself. As in all faiths, the individual is responsible for developing his/her relationship and meaning with ourgod/dess, though I might suggest that all pagans get on Eris's \"good side\" if they want to kept informed of herwhereabouts. On the other hand, since many of us Discordians are known to associate with Witches, Wiccans,Druids, and other right-handed types, we enjoy sharing the fellowship of our fellow pagans. . . we're pretty goodat raising energy, not to mention raising hell at the party afterwards (yeah, we're the \"black sheep\", but we likeit that way). I'm fortunate enough to share spirituality with the Circle Lorien, which is a mixed bag of Wiccans,Shamans, and the usual collection of non-alligned pagans. There's nothing that says Discordians can't be nicepeople, and if you DID say it, we don't recognize your rule, anyway. . . so there. Many Discordians, however,do develop a very strong theologic base, although individualist and private they may be in expressing it.Discordians believe in the control of the future's direction through the application of Magick in everyday life.Man is the only creature at odds with his existence, in that his power is measured by how well he can influencehis environment. \"Love is the Law. . Love Through Will\" means that we can strive towards those thingsimportant to us as individuals as a result of our own magick upon our world. Like the rocks, and the trees, andthat funny little green bug that eats the zucchini plants in your garden, we all have a right to be here, on our ownterms. Through Chaos Magick, we create that place for ourselves. . . and if happiness is the ability to dream,success is the ability to turn those dreams into reality.Hail Eris!\"One person steals a buckle, and he is executed.

Maybe,talking to Goddess is the same sort of thing.A Erisian, by nature, is an animist. That is, we hold that all events within the Universe contain spirit. Theprocess of nature seems complex. Fundamentally, complex structures are a collection of simpler structures. Thesimplest structures are themselves manifestations of energy. It may be that spirit is another energetic process.Spirit generates some level of consciousness to an event. Each structure contributes to the consciousness of themore complex structures it is a part of. The more complex the event, then, the more complex the consciousnesswould be. A Water molecule will have a more complex awareness than a hydrogen atom. The Entire Oceanwill, then, be more conscious than a drop of water. The Universe or Multiverse ; is the most complex event ofwhich we are aware. So! It may follow that the Universe would have the most evolved level of Consciousnessof all. That consciousness is what I think many refer to as Goddess. In modern physics, it does not make senseto discuss the dimensions of space without including the dimensions of time with it. Also, we think that theremay be another set of dimensions that we may not even be capable of being aware of, each with its time-spacedescriptions. St. Augustine argued that eternity would be a present without a past or future, and a sphere withouta boundary, and a center that is everywhere. Now, imagine the being or non-being (perhaps Eris the EternalOne is both) that is so self aware that The Eternal Chaos knows every event within time-space in a singlemoment, even beyond the singularity that gave our universe birth. Such a being would be eternal. Add to thatthe part of quantum theory that states that everything is energy, that what appears to be structure is just amanifestation of that energetic process. Many Pagan cultures, from Sumer to Norway, have said that The"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"Eternal Chaos created the universe from the body of some titanic being. Polynesian and Egyptian claim TheEternal Chaos that hatched the Universe from some cosmic egg. (I like this one better, as it suggests life fromlife, rather than life from death). There is even a thought that the titan or egg is really still alive or intact, and issimply slumbering and we are but a dream. Whatever the explanation is, Erisians do not easily see a separationbetween the Universe and Eris. Quantum theory supports this perspective.The problem is that our minds are entirely too small to comprehend the Universe as a whole. We have a fairunderstanding of our corner of it, and can induce what the rest must be like. We have a fair understanding ofourselves, and make inductions about The Eternal Chaos from that. We filter Eris down to our level, Giving Herrolls and parts to play. And She is clever. She can play as many roles as we can throw at Her. So, whatevername, color, character we want, that is what we will find in Her. And She plays these rolls, not so much toentertain us (though I expect She would have fun doing so) but to take us out of the darkness of our ignorance,and into enlightenment. Some suggest that She learns something by doing this.The Catholic Church has officially Anathematized anyone who would hold Pantheism (which is whatErisianism is to be true, in effect, condemning us to hell. The thinking is that Pantheism renders The EternalOne amoral and impersonal. Does Erisianism render Eris? Does this not euhumerize The Mother of Us All,projecting onto that person our limitations? Addressing another human as a complete individual is very difficultfor me, I even have difficulty doing that for myself. As addressed above, The Eternal Chaos would be aware ofevery second right now, and of every nano-liter of the universe right now. I cannot imagine an intellect thatformidable and eternal that could not participate in each process of nature, enjoying each human, tree, and rockon every planet, in every universe.On the other hand, are my filters of The Eternal Chaos better than anyone else? No! I would be hard pressed tosay so. Better yet, let us listen to each other's stories. Then, we may refine our perspectives to a better view.Common GroundWhile finding common ground between the monism of Erisianism and the dualism of Monotheism may seemdifficult, they do have some themes in common. For both there is no place where Eris is not; there is nothingEris cannot do; there is nothing Eris cannot know. The difference is in how The Eternal Chaos perceivesthe Universe. For the Erisian, The Eternal Chaos knowledge of the Universe is self-knowledge. Just as I cannotnot be in my body, Eris cannot be in anything other than Her body. Omnipotents, for The Eternal Chaos is self-empowerment. Solomon asked the question, does Elohym really dwell with humanity on the Earth? (2Chronicles 6. 18); The Erisian will answer, Yes, are we not all a part of Her?The real difference between sacred awareness of the irrational, absolute universe and the rational, relativeuniverse of secular awareness is the scope of emotional commitment. For this Child of Eris there is no placewhere The Eternal Chaos is not. Hence, when developing a rite that does not focus on The Eternal Chaos Iassume She will be there as a source of every process involved."},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"Property is Theft.Property is Freedom.Property is an Illusion.Questioning authority doesn't work all the time, sometimes you have to interrogate authority (preferably witha rubber hose.)Rev.

And they started fighting, and they started throwing punch all over the placeand everything.Finally Zeus calmed things down and declared that an arbitrator must be selected, which was a reasonablesuggestion, and all agreed. He sent them to a shepherd of Troy, whose name was Paris because his mother hada lot of gaul and had married a Frenchman; but each of the sneaky goddesses tried to outwit the others by goingearly and offering a bribe to Paris.Athena offered him Heroic War Victories, Hera offered him Great Wealth, and Aphrodite offered him the MostBeautiful Woman on Earth. Being a healthy young Trojan lad, Paris promptly accepted Aphrodite's bribe andshe got the apple and he got screwed.As she had promised, she maneuvered earthly happenings so that Paris could have Helen (the Helen) then livingwith her husband. The Trojan War followed when Sparta demanded their Queen back and husband Menelaus,King of Sparta.

Those cackling hens that call themselves Goddesses decided to fight amongst themselves forpossession of the Apple. And yes, there were five goddess squabbling over the damn thing. The other two wereCeres (goddess of agriculture), and Nike(goddess of victory).When Zeus gave Paris the task of choosing who the Apple is given to, he could of done the right thing and gaveit to Thetis, but Noooooo.

One thing most faiths agree on isthat the nonexistence you experience when you die is not permanent -- after all, you didn't exist before you wereborn, and it didn't last then, either. We Erisians believe that when you die, you go to Hades. For those of youstill recovering from other theologies, Hades is not the same as Hell.

The Akashic Records are stored here (I'd have moreinfo on the Records, but my library card'' expired in a previous incarnation, and I've been too busy to get a newone). As far as it can be determined, any thing'''s path is as follows: first, it starts as an archetype in theBeforelife, then it becomes an idea in Pre-Illusion, then it exists'' in Reality, and then it comes to rest in theAfterlife; the whole process being guided and manipulated from Limbo.

Whether the form is that of astar or a person, the process is the same. First, the subtle energy exists. Next, it becomes manifest and takes onlife. After a time, the life passes away, but the subtle energy goes on, either returning to the subtle realm, whereit remains, or once again attaching to manifest things. The character of your existence is determined by theenergies to which you connect yourself. If you attach yourself to gross energies--loving this person, hating thatclan, rejecting one experience or habitually indulging in another--then you will lead a series of heavy, attachedlives. This can go on for a very long and tedious time. The way of the integral being is to join with higherthings. By holding to that which is refined and subtle, she traverses refined and subtle realms. If she enters theworld, she does so lightly, without attachment.

M. , K. S. C. Novus Ordo Seclorum Erisium. . . dedicated to The Prettiest One. . .Okay, this is a discussion on magick, eh? Whoa, like, conjuring demons, throwing hexes, and predicting thefuture? Manipulation of the Hodge/Podge to TOTAL WORLD DOMINATION?! No.First off, any demons that might be around aren't gonna waste time with Discordians (they're after theGreyfaced Religions, 'cause the guilt they can lay on them. . . ). Throwing hexes is painful, and bad for thejoints. And if you are worried about the future, and world domination, then you have no business trying outmagick anyway.So, like, what is Discordian magick, eh? Okay, Discordian Magick is a way in which the Discordian practicingit (called a Phool) to either add to or create Eristic Vibes or to deflect or destroy Aneristic Vibes.Some Terms:•Vibes: Psycho-emotional energy given off be humans and other creatures.•Eristic: Pertaining to Eris; pertaining to chaos in general.•Aneristic: Against Eris; pertaining to order in general.•Phool: one who is aware of the presence an actions of Vibes and uses Discordian Magick to manipulate thesame•Face: An aspect of Discordian Magick; the category of magickNature: The end-product of Discordian Magick•Hodge: The pseudo-Zen force of Order in the world•Podge: The pseudo-Zen force of Chaos in the world•The Doctrine: things have a tendency to work out ok in the end•Ju-Ju: The \"aftershocks\" of Discordian Magick; the long-term effects.•The Sacred Chao: The image of the Hodge and Podge.•Greyface: One who unconsciously generates Aneristic Vibes.•THEM: A group who consciously generates Aneristic Vibes; Phools gone Greyface.•Discordian: One who unconsciously generates Eristic Vibes.•Norm: A normal, vibe-unaware, guy-on-the-street. Typically Aneristic, due to the great amount of ambientAneristic Vibes in the world.Vibes: what they be.Okay, vibes are like energy which is given off by all creatures. You may know of Vril or Kirlian Aura or AlphaWaves or some other nonsense. Vibes may or may not be them, its really not important. What IS important isthat they exist, and if they exist, then they can be manipulated and created and destroyed. (Destroying wavescan be bad Ju-ju. Be careful. )How do we know vibes are there? Because, if you open up, you can feel them. You're being hit by them all thetime, just most people aren't aware of them. Next time someone is being extremely chaotic, notice how that"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"person's actions and presence affect you. . . the same for someone being extremely ordered. Sometimes, thevibes can change your mood, your attitude, even your health.So, now that I know the vibes are there, what can I do with them? Okay, eh? So, there are two basic kinds ofvibes: Eristic and Aneristic. Eristic Vibes are pulses of chaotic energy, while Aneristic Vibes are pulses ofordered energy. . . this means the fundamental concepts of chaos and order, not the waves themselves. (I. E. ifvibes have a structure, both Eristic and Aneristic probably have the same structure. It is the kind of energywhich differs, not the structure. ) Eristic Vibes USUALLY cause Chaos, Discord and Confusion (the first threeFaces (q. v. )) and Aneristic Vibes USUALLY cause Bureaucracy and Aftermath (the last two Faces). I sayUSUALLY because, like most things, there are several occasions when the five will cross over. A Phool mustlearn to appreciate the spinning of the Chao, and the counter-push-pull of the Hodge and Podge, and learn whenEristic Vibes are needed, and when Aneristic Vibes are needed. As a very general rule, the world needs moreEristic Vibes. . . there are far more Greyfaces in the world than there are Discordians.FacesOkay, eh, Discordian Magick is not exempt from the Law of Fives. There are five facets to Discordian Magic,just like the five faces of a pentagon. Ergo, to keep in line with this analogy, these aspects of magick have beentermed \"Faces\". The 5 Faces are, naturally: Chaos, Discord, Confusion, Bureaucracy , and Aftermath.When a Phool manipulates Vibes, the method in which the Vibes are manipulated is defined by the Face.Some brief explanations:•Chaos: Vibes manipulated within the Face of Chaos, generally speaking, are designed simply to increase theamount of Eristic Energy in the area. Chaos magick is specifically unorganized, and often purposeless. It is usedto change mood, tone, and is also a way to banish Greyfaces.•Discord: Vibes manipulated within the Face of Discord are deigned to affect large numbers of Norms, andsometimes Greyfaces. It is the second most destructive form of magick, and requires care in its use. It causesNorms to act in ways they would not normally, often for reasons they do not fully comprehend.•Confusion: The most common form of magick, Vibes manipulated within the Face of Confusion is aDiscordians primary weapon against Anerism. It is a subtle form of magick, designed to gradually wean normsand Greyfaces from their hopeless addiction to Aneristic Vibes.•Bureaucracy : Vibes manipulated within the Face of Bureaucracy must be treated with care, as they can easilyslip into Aneristic ones instead of Eristic. Bureaurocratic Magick is designed to affect a large number of Normsinto unconsciously succumbing to Eristic Influence. When used especially well, this form of magick isparticularly effective against Greyfaces, as they may not even know that they are being manipulated.•Aftermath: Vibes manipulated within the Face of Aftermath are the most dangerous tool a Phool can use. Theyare by far the most destructive, and involve a permanent destruction of Vibes, and a ceasing of the Spinning ofthe Chao. Aftermath Magick is serious stuff. It means a closing and a te rmination of Energy. Don't use thisstuff unless you're, like, really sure of yourself and are prepared to accept responsibility for the Ju-Ju you maycause."},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"Nature, eh?The Nature of Magick is not really an integral part of the Magick, but it helps the Phool to classify the effect hismagick will have on the world. There are many natures, but some of the basic ones are:Creative: Designed tocreate ambient vibes. Usually called \"Eristic Creative\" or \"Aneristic Creative\".•Destructive: As Creative, but designed to destroy the vibes in question.•Anti-Greyface: Countering Aneristic attacks by Greyfaces, or planting seeds of Chaos in their subconscious.•Personal: Magick designed to alter the Phool's own moods, feelings, and attitudes. Helps recover fromAneristic attacks.•Ritual: The ritual is a means of simply causing Ju-Ju. It rarely has immediate effects, but when done, the VibeJu-Ju will cause long- term effects which the Phool may desire.Oracle: A means of \"seeing the future\". . . not really, but what it does is open the Phool's mind to ideas whichmay indeed affect the future.Part FiveThis has been a very basic introduction into the theories and practice of Discordian Magick.

These simple words stopped the powerful general dead in histracks.Realization flooded in. The general suddenly understood that the master had risked his life in order to teachhim a great truth in the most effective way imaginable. \"Forgive me, master, for what I was able to do. \" He felt all at once gratitude, amazement, and shame.\"Here lie the gates of Heaven, \" said the master.This is an interesting tale. It tells us that even in ancient times, the sages had already evolved their spiritualunderstanding to a point where they saw Heaven and Hell as states of mind rather than places.Not everyone shared this view, of course. We have always had vivid descriptions and images of Heaven andHell from way back. A few enlightened beings recognized these as colorful metaphors, but many took themliterally. In the cosmic scale of things, it wasn't that long ago that most human beings thought Heaven wasactually somewhere beyond the clouds and Hell was deep underground in some dark, cavernous setting.Specifics varied, but the overall idea remained the same. Asgard, Valhalla, Olympus, Hades, Inferno, Purgatory,all were places one might go after the death of one's physical body.For many thinking individuals in the modern age, the idea of Heaven and Hell as actual places has fallen by thewayside. We still enjoy tales of the afterlife every now and then, but we don't necessarily believe that thesestories correspond to reality.At the same time, there are still many who do believe. Without too much effort one can still find people whosimply won't let go of the notion that Heaven and Hell exist somewhere. Quite a few Fundamentalist Christians,among others, will readily cite passages from the Bible to \"prove\" that Heaven and Hell are as real as yourcorner grocery. George W. Bush made news last year for having expressed his belief that those who had notturned to Christ for salvation were headed for Hell.Some time ago a group of religious extremists protested in front of a Disney store in the Midwest. You may findthis surprising. Surely Disney is as unoffending as they come? What could these people possibly complainabout?As it turned out, they were demonstrating against the action figures for the Disney cartoon \"Gargoyles. \" Themain characters from this cartoon had bat-like wings, tails, horns, and fangs. To create toys in that image wasequivalent to flaunting the image of demons and furthering the cause of Satan."},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"Disney employees received death threats and harassing overtures. The store manager was told, in a matter-of-fact manner, that he was destined to burn for all eternity. Apparently the demonstrators took the idea of Hellquite seriously.In this age of political correctness, it is tempting to fall back to the \"everyone is right in his or her own way\"position. Can we not say that people like the above, who believe in a literal interpretation of the Bible, are justas entitled to their opinion? Is not their opinion just as valid as any other?Perhaps, but as we look deeper we see that there are numerous logic problems with the literal interpretation. Theforemost problem is that the horrors of Hell and the pleasures of Heaven are completely subjective quantities.What is horrible to some may not be so bad to others; what is wonderful or pleasurable for me may not be foryou.For instance, consider the case of a masochist. Does such an individual go to Heaven or Hell? Wouldn't Heavenfor him be a place where he can sample a great variety of delicious pain? Wouldn't Hell for him be a placewhere he is barred from any pain whatsoever? Wouldn't this be a complete reversal of the typical conception?Another problem, equally crippling, is the difficulty in reconciling the existence of Hell with the all-lovingnature of God. If God truly loves His children, why would He subject even the most sinful ones to eternalsuffering? Why not just settle for eternal imprisonment, sans grotesque torture? Isn't rejection from Heaven andloss of freedom for all eternity punishment enough?Look at our penal system. What do we do with our most heinous criminals nowadays? Often we are satisfied tosimply keep them away from society; we feel no need to inflict pain upon them. Such was not necessarily thecase back in a more barbaric age (or, admittedly, in some parts of the world today). At that particular level ofhumanity's development, society would not hesitate to torture prisoners, and many cruel implements weredesigned for just that purpose. Nor was it enough to execute a criminal; bloodthirsty sensibilities demandeddeath with maximum pain and terror - hence the Iron Maiden.(Iron Maiden of Nuremberg, not Iron Maiden the heavy metal band. Used as early as 1515 AD, the devicefeatured spikes of varying lengths on the inside of its cover. This cover closed on its victim slowly, so that thespikes would penetrate various parts of the body just enough to cause excruciating pain but not immediatedeath. The second shortest spikes were right at the eye balls, so the victim would lose his eyes shortly before thelast spike drove through his heart, finally killing him. )Most of us would like to believe that we as a species have outgrown this hideous phase. Today we treat even theworst of the worst criminals in a humane way. If we must put one to death, we do so as quickly and aspainlessly as possible.Compared to our human-created system, doesn't a literal Hell featuring the most horrible punishmentimaginable seem savage and primitive by comparison? If Goddess is infinitely greater than human beings inevery way, wouldn't Her mercy and compassion surpass ours as well? If even puny human beings, imperfectand born full of sin, can rise above treating the wicked in a cruel way, then why shouldn't Goddess, the paragonof perfection?When we look at it in this light, we quickly come to the conclusion that if Goddess is truly the embodiment oflove and compassion, then She would never allow the existence of Hell as a place where sinners burn forever. Itseems more likely then, that Hell is a concept invented by human beings for the specific purpose of invokingfear in other human beings. The inhumane and barbaric nature of Hell is simply a reflection of the character ofits mythmakers."},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"The key to this realization lies in thinking it through. People who still adhere to the old school are those whohave not bothered to mentally pursue all the ramifications and implications of their belief.When you do think it through, you cast aside the shackles of ignorance and savagery, and see the inevitabletruth. Heaven and Hell exist within every one of us. That's the only way it can be. At any time we have thepotential to experience either extreme or any point in between. We are not elevated to Heaven or cast down intoHell after we die; we transport ourselves there, and even though most of us don't realize it, we have the abilityto arrive or depart at will.Forget about all this eternal torment, everlasting pain nonsense. We are mature souls and evolved spirits who nolonger need to be kept in line with scary stories. We do not need morality dictated to us and enforced withthreats of punishment; our own morality springs from within, driven by our natural desire to seek harmony,love, and oneness. This being the case, our own conscience, higher selves, karmic lessons, and spiritual mastersgovern us in fundamental ways far more effective than fear ever can.The sages were right about Heaven and Hell.

They didn't overemphasize the intellect, but integrated mind, body,and spirit in all things. This allowed them to become masters of knowledge rather than victims of concepts. If anew invention appeared, they looked for the troubles it might cause as well as the shortcuts it offered. Theyvalued old ways that had been proven effective, and they valued new ways if they could be proven effective. Ifyou want to stop being confused, then emulate these ancient folk: join your body, mind, and spirit in all you do.Choose food, clothing, and shelter that accords with nature. Rely on your own body for transportation. Allowyour work and your recreation to be one and the same. Do exercise that develops your whole being and nor justyour body. Listen to music that bridges the three spheres of your being (mind, body, spirit). Choose leaders fortheir virtue rather than their wealth or power. Serve others and cultivate yourself simultaneously. Understandthat true growth comes from meeting and solving the problems of life in a way that is harmonizing to yourselfand to others. If you can follow these simple old ways, you will be continually renewed.The Doctrine of the Secondary Snub:One upon a time, in a galaxy far, far away. .It was a time of trouble for the Gods. Vishnu had carried Olympus to the heavens and hidden the Gods' facesfrom us mere mortals. Meanwhile, another party lurked on the horizon.Three faeries threw a birthday bash for the Princess Aurora, meaning Dawn*. They invited the entire kingdom,and other faeries, and the pixies that steal lighters, and the gremlins that drink radiator fluid, and the gnomeswith pickaxes that live in your stomach who like to get drunk and mine. However, they once again neglected toadd Eris Discordia, the Mistress of Mayhem, Evinicar of Evolution, and Chancellor of Change, to their guestlist. Well, a party isn't a party without Eris watching over, if not attending in full force.So, once again, Eris crashed the party, this time disguised as an ugly old apple sales-person. She rolled herinfamous Golden Apple across the banquet table. It fell into the baby Aurora's cradle, and the stem prickedher, sending her into a deep sleep that lasted twenty-three years, and ended with a handsome dwarf kissing her,waking her, and spawning several animated movies with singing mice and countless merchandising gimmicks.The Moral of this story: We are all God/desses of our own realities.

We humans, as a species, have the strange habit of\"humanizing\" the SUPREME BEING. It makes us feel more connected to the GREAT UNIVERSALONENESS. For we Discordians, ERIS is not some strict authoritative tyrant father figure like YHWH, tellingyou he loves you one moment, then condemning you to some abysmal fiery hell at the slightest infraction. Noris she a barefooted, pregnant hippie chick who doesn't shave her leg or armpits like some of the Wiccan whoworship her. Nor is she a man-hating, rampaging radical lesbian terrorist as some Dianan wiccans would wantyou to believe. In all actuality she can be all that, and more. She can be anything she wants to be, and anythingyou want her to be. For ERIS is the very nature of CHAOS. With her, nothing is true, and everything ispossible. But unlike other Deities, ERIS can change with the times. She is the Modern Goddess. Wild, free,strong, independent, passionate. She humbly takes no credit when things are good, and takes no blame whenthings go bad, Because that is the nature of CHAOS. Lets face it, shit happens. But ERIS has given us theability to ride the CHAOS WAVE. We DIscordians romp and play, sing and dance, in the playground that isREALITY, basking in the warm glow of Mother ERIS. She teases us, and torments us. She challenges us,tantalizes us, comforts us. Her gentle laughter eases us in times of trouble.

Itis not that we are against rules, we just are not bound by them should we choose not to be. We understand thatthere are need for rules, but they shouldn't stifle the creative spirit or our freedom. Just because we erisians arevery independent, does not mean that we can't be team players.We Erisians have nothing against leaders, it is that we are enlightened enough that we ourselves don't needthem. We will acknowledge experts in their fields (I damnsure want my surgeon to be in charge of myoperation), but we do not fall in worship of them.3) Discordians like to create chaos: This is another one that a lot of erisians believe. No one can create chaos,for that is the realm of goddess Herself. At best we manipulate the flow of eristic vibes in order to combatGreyfaceian vibes. Many discordians think that they are creating chaos, when in fact all they are doing is beingdrama queens.4) Discordianism is paganism(or Wiccan): In actuality paganism and wicca are in fact discordian sects (theyjust won't admit it).

We need a continuing array of newideas, and must recognize and reward the divinitemps who produce them. At the same time, it takes focus andself-restraint to maintain the discipline of thinking and researching very broadly, while implementing morenarrowly. Many organizations tend to pursue more projects than they can effectively handle. We must balancereward and distraction. Nonetheless, we will try more new directions than we need in order to leave room forthe inevitable disappointments. And since major new projects or directions are especially difficult anduncertain, we must focus our best associates on these newer opportunities, as full-time champions.Business Plans: Good plans help maintain consistent growth with fewer surprises. The specific objectives,priorities, strategies and processes in a plan should be initially guided by tier-2 senior management, and then bedirectly created in more detail by each manager who must ultimately own responsibility for the results. Theplanning processes should be interactive and responsive to differing views.Role Before We Roll: Since many new ventures will fail, we will generally try to minimize the cost of failure toa manageable level by not acting on an unnecessarily large scale too soon. Changes that involve many clientsand divinitemps are particularly difficult and error-prone. As we change processes and automate labor, we mustminimize the risk of a poor transition. We should role-model new approachesbefore we roll them to manylocations, clients or divinitemps, without forfeiting windows of opportunity that require fast time-to-market.MULTIVERSE Inc.Megacosm-Class ServiceMegacosm-Class Service is unlike other strategic business goals.

The women of the village gathered at various times during the week to wash the family'sclothes in the river. This was a very large village, and they had many clothes, so there was much washing goingon.Now, after many years of washing, the women had come to understand that it was important to do your washingupstream from everyone else if you could. They knew that washing downstream from someone else meant thatsomeone's soap suds and dirt going through your clothes. Being down river meant being lower in status.As the village grew, the women made changes in their washing habits, that they might be upriver whenwashing. Some took to washing at night, until there were many washing at night. Some would wade farther andfarther out, sometimes needing a raft, till there were washers all the way across. Some tried to go much fartherupstream, until they were walking a mile up the rocky bank to find a good spot and not bother those fartherdown stream.One day a wife stood up and declared that this washing was getting to her, and that the men should be doing thewashing, since they were the ones making most of the clothes dirty. Amazingly, the men agreed.The next day they set out to wash. They (having heard the tales from their wives) quickly saw all the problems.At first they tried to schedule things very carefully, but realized that they weren't fast enough to get done intime. Then they tried a system gang washing, where several people would work on a load at once, but realizedthat then the were just spreading the dirt out amongst a given load, thus making everyone a little dirtier at times.Some of the men got angry at one another, when someone's best shirt was downstream from their worst pants.Others got frustrated and yelled that some had too many clothes. Fights ensued.After a time the village was seething with anger. The men hated each other, the women were mad at the menbecause of the poor washing job, and the children were mad because the parents were.One day a man took slight to a neighbor moving upstream during washing, so he grabbed a rock and bashed hisneighbors head in, staining the water with blood, thus ruining many clothes. Those whose clothes were ruinedgot mad and started grabbing rocks. The women yelled to stop, but began fighting amongst themselves insupport of their husbands. The children looked on in horror, as their parents slowly killed each other off.Near this scene, sitting serenely under a tree, was a beautiful woman, shining a golden apple. Floating near herwas a pig shaped ghost, who regarded the scene with interest.

Justto make sure no one could place it exactly, She made sure that the universe appears to be a different age depending on whatyou observe. If you observe the Bible, it's only a few thousand years old. A quick gander at the Vedas (and the nifty bell [whichis purported to be 6 million years old] that some of Ghandi's contemporaries found while mining) will indicate to anyone withhalf a brain (and not an ounce more) that people have been about for at least 87 trillion years and have been abstaining fromsex for most of that time in order to reach enlightenment (saving semen, they will inform you, is good for the noodle. Not badfor the spaghetti, either). Someone foolish enough to look at physics will think the universe is a few billion years old. Ofcourse, She left enough evidence around to make sure that everyone can figure out that there is a colossal Joke afoot.The Bible teaches that you can't be free-willed unless you can choose to do the wrong thing, and hence sin has to exist. It thenmentions this perfect, free-willed god guy and hopes no one will notice.The Vedas are a little more subtle in that there aren't any flat-out contradictions. However, the whole thing looks like it wasmade up on the fly by RACTER, the computer program that wrote The Policeman's Beard is Half Constructed. ''Even people who look at physics can figure out that Eris is running the show, because every subatomic particle that ever wasconspires to keep you in the dark (and will break any other law of physics or causality to do it).She keeps all the religions in place to make sure the confusion stays nice and high, and grants miracles to random people nowand again to make sure everyone thinks that they are part of the Right Faith. The only religion that DOESN'T experience lots ofmiracles, in fact, is Discordianism. This proves conclusively that we're the only religion that IS right. You see, we don't thinkthat anyone is Right, including us. Since we aren't going to start thinking we're right no matter what She does, She doesn'tbother with the miracles. Well, not the big, loud Lady-of-Fatima ones, anyway. She has granted me any number of blessings,which I accept with a conspiratorial wink.I tell people about them, mainly because they won't accept them as blessings (one such blessing [which I've received multipletimes, Hail Eris] is to have a piece of profoundly buggy code work flawlessly until I put it into real production, whereupon itcrashes like a 1939 economy. Now, the code shouldn't have ever worked, but the Lady granted me a blessing and allowed it towork on FlukePower. Of course, the blessing has to wear off SOMETIME. Once, She really saved my ass with one of theseblessings. You see, I wrote a program to create new user accounts in batch, and used it to make some 300 new accounts at theend of the summer. I ran a tiny batch afterwards, which was to create only 8 accounts. Every one of those 8 came up with badusernames because of a nasty bug I left in the code. This code should never have worked at all, and very well should havecreated all 300 of those usernames incorrectly. I would have spent weeks untangling the resulting mess.

While they were beating the crap out of each other, she examined the elephant.But instead of stopping after one feel, she touched the whole thing, including the tail, which felt like a rope. \"It'sjust a big animal with big sides, ears, feet, tusk teeth, nose and a skinny tail, \" she thought. \"What a bunch offools these guys are. \"She then said \"Stop!

Many like toask why we do it and what it means. Since this is a 'magical' chain book of some sort, I will explain itsomewhat. Hailing Eris is really like hailing a taxi. It gets you some attention, and possibly even a ridesomewhere. It is not an act of worship, unless you want it to be. It is simply a way of greeting one another, or ofderiding one another. It can also be used conveniently as a swear word, though Eris may not be in a good moodwhen you choose to do so and woe befall you if She should happen to take the hailing seriously and show up tosee you whining.On the 'occult' side of things, hailing Eris is an effective banishing of all aneristic energies which may bearound. . . such as Serious Discordians getting pissy, High Magi complaining about Aeonic shifts, or otherCabbage-like things which may interfere with your elaborately unplanned and spectacularly spontaneousmagical rites. All you need do is simply yell HAIL ERIS at the top of your voice, laugh, and then you are readyto start.If the first hailing Eris doesn't do the trick for some reason, such as not having holes in your socks or some otherimpediment to magical effectiveness, simply repeat it again. Or use the Greek phrase Io Eris Elandros! Io ErisElepgolis! That ought to raise hairs and do the trick. And if that doesn't work, you can always try other methodsof banishing, such as spraying beer all around, gobbling like a turkey, or start yelling \"Boo!\", as Thornleypointed out.Hailing Eris at random times throughout your day/night is also recommended. But you know if you are simplyshowing off to the non-Discordians (are there still any?) than you may as well use KALLISTI, but that's a topicfor another time.YOUR I. Q.

The two Wiccans glared at her. \"You lack the solemnity needed to do proper invocations, \" one of themtold her.

Hail Eris!Thus the Nonprophet speaks:As an early Church Father of the Discordian religion, I am often slapped with paternity suits. No, seriously, Iam often called upon to settle points of doctrine, such as \"Please tell So-and-So that he or she doesn'tunderstand Discordianism, and I do. \"In the first place, how do you know So-and-So doesn't understand Discordianism, if you don't even know whatsex he or she is? And what is all this shit about who does or does not understand Discordianism? Who the hellcares?If Discordianism was meant to be understood, it would be like Zen Buddhism. The greatest of all Discordians,Malaclypse the Younger, doesn't understand anything whatsoever about the religion he co-founded.Only I, Omar Khayyam Ravenhurst, Bullgoose of the Discordian Orthodoxy, can really tell you what it's allabout. And why should I? After all, I don't even know what sex you are. Moreover, Discordians are warnedagainst personal contact with one another. Any theology to which I made significant contributions is going toattract plenty of screwballs.Then again, if you want to spend the rest of your life arguing with some nut who believes flying saucers areonly the first wave, to be followed soon by flying cups, that's your business. Why should I care if you getinvolved with the Manson Family or become a brainwashed zombie in a cult run by a crackpot who callshimself the Nine-Legged Jesus?Incidentally enough, I once received a Christmas card from a member of the Manson Family, namely Charles.In return for that honor, I appointed Charley Manson the Discordian Superintendent of Sunday Schools."},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"Discordianism has accomplished much in a short period of time, all without being understood by anybody. Inthe early seventies, for instance, our saint, Doctor Van Van Mojo, made a beeswax graven image of Jehovahand stuck pins in it, thus giving birth to the God is Dead theology. But Discordian Crazy Lou says God is notdead, he is just drunk. If so, you can bet it was a Discordian who bought him the booze.Don't get us wrong, we don't just assassinate the deities of a few rival religions and then rest on our laurels.Recently we made a great theological discovery: Eris Discordia, our Goddess, is infallible -- (Hail, Eris!) -- butthat does not mean she won't lie.Our incessant research on the historical Eris and the Primitive Discordian Society has been unearthing startlinglost ignorance, right and left. Take the Last Supper, for instance. In our faith, there is a First Brunch, accordingto the Dead Fish Scrolls, which have just been translated.That's right, Malaclypse the Elder and Diogenes got the idea for the Erisian religion over brunch in a Greek (ofcourse) deli in Athens. Although the entire dialogue of this meeting is available, it is difficult to read in theoriginal because the scribe encoded it by writing the entire book, cover included, upside down. Why, isanybody's guess.In those days we found nobody ever killed you as a heretic or a cultist for starting a new religion. The Greeksfigured the more religions the better. That way, all the gods would be happy. They needed to be kept in goodmoods for various reasons.Shortly after the First Brunch, before the Second Brunch, the Temple of Erisian Mysteries was designed byMalaclypse the Elder -- a vast, bewildering maze, and the only edifice in the world larger on the inside than onthe outside.In the late 1960's when Pope Paul removed St. Patrick from the Catholic calendar of saints, our greatestaccomplishment of all transpired; to wit, St. Patrick was added to the Discordian calendar of saints. Malaclypsethe Younger sent the Pope an inspired letter of gratitude and a Pope card.Now that St. Patrick is safely under the patronage and protection of the Discordian Society, we can tell you whythe Catholics ousted him. St. Patrick, you see, was gay. When St. Patrick was a Catholic saint, the Pope got tosay whatever he wanted about the old mick. Well, now he's our saint, and we are all popes.St. Patrick hated snakes -- good snakes, bad snakes, big snakes, he didn't care -- nor did he have much use forhomophobes. Nowadays, there are no snakes in Ireland. Many homophobes, however, remain. So in honor ofSt. Patrick, we Discordians propose restoring a little balance to the situation.Whenever gays are forbidden to participate in a St. Patrick's Day Parade, everyone who is outraged shoulddonate a pair of snakes to the ecology of the Emerald Isle. Likewise, whenever an Irish politician utters ahomophobic statement, snakes should be smuggled into Ireland.Beyond pouring over temple blueprints, and plotting torment for the poor Irish, Discordians have beendesigning new spiritual disciplines for reaching Eternity before it's too late.Once such exercise is mantra-chanting: \"Yada-yada-yada, sis-boom-bah, Chaos Rules, blah-blah-blah.

We have Greyface Graud as ours, the HairlessPrimate From Atlantis that started all this \"good\" and \"evil\" business. But this mess started way before Mr.Morals came into the picture.It was Eris' twin, ANERIS, the non-being. A little bout of sibling rivalry started this whole thing, becauseANERIS was a jealous bitch and Stole Eris children. Well, Eris made more and more, but ANERIS just kepttaking them. What a Bitch! Well, to try and smooth things out, Eris made little playthings, order and did-order,and decided to call them new names, ERisic for dis-order and ANerisic for order. Aneris liked that, and all waswell until Dad, the void, had yet another kid, the nameless Spirit. He was suppose to live with Aneris and Eris,but Eris was afraid that Aneris would steal him too. So Dad said \"When your brother leaves the state of being,he shall not return to the state of non-being, but to me, the void, from whence he came. \" If you can figure thatout, you'll be one step closer to Illumination.Anyways, back to Mr. Poopy Head, he was a freak of nature, and hated all his People. They were hairy, and hewas pale and Hairless. They also smoked pot all day and just were interested in having a good time. Well,people weren't put here to have a good time, he said. They were here to try and appease great invisible forcesthat he called \"good\" and \"evil\", and that we should all stop having a good time and be miserable trying tofigure out his weird ideas. He gained a few followers, and well, to sum it up, destroyed Atlantis and started anew Civilization based on his cornbread ideas. We don't like him for this.

You cryabout the abuses of one group of masters while you feel content to live under another group of masters. Andyou think yourselves better, or freer in your example of slavery? Inside, you hate yourselves for this. That iswhy some of you are pretending to prove yourselves free and uninhibited by doing and planning all sorts ofdaring and bold heroic actions. Suckers! Actions of that sort are only done to impress the masters. Do you thinkthat intentionally getting your ass kicked by cops or by intentionally going to jail, that you are freeingyourselves? Suckers! That kind of crap used to be unaffectionately known as the 'honkey' or 'white radical'syndrome here in the States during a time when all sorts of pretentious revolutionaries were trying to bluff thegovernment.To be free, you avoid overt fighting and struggle. Have you ever heard of the old Taoist sages who lived under atotalitarian slavery that makes today's States look like a playground? Read the words they left behind. You pickand choose your battles. You don't let the masters simply pick you off so that you can make some stupidstatement. History is littered with those failed pretensions. And where have they gotten us?

The interesting thing about this river is that it runs both ways at once. It is my belief thatthe hand of Eris -><- simbolizes this two way river.Some Occultists as well as Buddhists believe that the Pineal Gland is the 3rd eye. It's located just behind theforehead, where the 3rd eye would be. The Pineal Gland has a central location just behind the third ventricle inthe brain. Because of it's central location in the synaptic gap it is not ruled by either hemisphere of the brain.The Discordians view activating their Pineal Gland as a way of contacting Eris, a way of being enlightened.Buddhists veiw meditating upon the Pineal Gland as a way of becoming centered and thus enlightened. Maybethe Pineal Gland is the two way river between the left and right hemispheres of the brain. Buddhists andOccultists believe that to become enlightened and activate the third eye they have to be Balanced. I believe thisis a balance between the right and left brain.The Sacred Chao is much like the Yin Yang, but it symbolized order and disorder. I believe that this refers tothe polarity of the right and left brain. The right brain is by it's nature disordered, creative and subjective, whilethe left brain is ordered, logical and objective. So the Chao not only symbolizes the balance of disorder andorder, but the balance of the right and left brain, and thus is the key to enlightenment and the activation of thePineal Gland. Since most people are more left brained the right brained, as well as more ordered and logicalthen creative and disordered, they must need to excorsize their right hemisphere more to become enlightened.More Disorder. More Creativity.

To that end,POEE proposes the countergame of NONSENSE AS SALVATION. Salvation from an ugly and barbarousexistence that is the result of taking order so seriously and so seriously fearing contrary orders and disorder, thatGAMES are taken as more important than LIFE; rather than taking LIFE AS THE ART OF PLAYINGGAMES. To this end, we propose that man develop his innate love for disorder, and play with The GoddessEris. And know that it is a joyful play, and that thereby CAN BE REVOKED THE CURSE OF GREYFACE.If you can master nonsense as well as you have already learned to master sense, then each will expose the otherfor what it is: absurdity. From that moment of illumination, a man begins to be free regardless of hissurroundings. He becomes free to play order games and change them at will. He becomes free to play disordergames just for the hell of it. He becomes free to play neither or both. And as the master of his own games, heplays without fear, and therefore without frustration, and therefore with good will in his soul and love in hisbeing.And when men become free then mankind will be free.May you be free of The Curse of Greyface.May the Goddess put twinkles in your eyes.May you have the knowledge of a sage,and the wisdom of a child. Hail Eris.These are the first few verses of Smooth Move, Genius,known among the profane as The Book of Genesis.In the beginning, Eris created heaven and earth.She then sobered up, and decided She may as well make the best of it.And the earth was without form and void. Void'' seemed to be a good idea, and the spirit moved Eris to pass waters.And Eris said, \"Let there be light, '' and there was light.And Eris saw the light, and that it was good. Then, thinking She was on a roll, Eris said \"Let there be pickled herring, ''which ended Her streak at one.And Eris called the light Night, and the darkness She called Day. She decided this might get everyone mad at Her, andswitched them around.And Eris said, \"Let us make man in our image, after our likeness, and let him be humorous and fun to hang with and havedominion over the Great Boredom that would otherwise make this universe interesting like unto a stale potato chip. '' Herother personalities, after briefly wondering why She was talking to Herself, saw that it was good (or, at least, that theyshould humor Her).And Eris hurriedly made the World and the dry land thereon so that She could create and plant a potato seed beforeanyone began to wonder what, exactly, a potato chip'' was.And Eris said \"Phew, '' and saw that it was good, if a little rushed.And Eris suddenly remembered having said something about making man, and went about collecting some odd bits ofPlay-Doh and Silly String. Lastly, she collected the Divine substance from under Her desk, known to the great alchemistsof old as the Sacred Pink Phlegmingo, but today has a rather less glorious name.With this did Eris mold man and woman, and breathed humor into their nostrils. Man and woman awakened to lifelaughing, pointing at the weird looking bumpy and dangly bits on each other.They then almost knocked each other over in their mad dash to the Tree of Self-Righteousness.And Eris did sigh, wondering what else one should expect from the willy-nilly creations of a Goddess with a hangover."},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"PRIESTS OF ERIS\"from the Erisian Liberation Front Field Guide, British Division\"The Priests of Eris have two main objectives: The spread of the Erisian Religion and OperationMindfuck. The first goal is the most straightforward but also the most difficult. We must spreadthe good word of Discordia to free peoples minds from the tyranny of order. I myself haveexplored this world of Britannia and find a great deal that makes no sense. For example, theinvisible lay lines that exist all over Britannia which catch and hold you and the laws of realityare variable; or the inevitable time warps of confusion which we all have experienced; or eventhe fairies which lift items from our bags and then replace them when we close and open it again.Apparently Eris is alive and well and living in Britannia. But we must relay her word and willthroughout out world and one day the other shards of Sosaria. Priests must tell others of Eris andtry to convert those who seem to be of the proper demeanor. There are already many followersof Discordia out there who don't even know it yet, and we MUST find them. Secondly, we haveOperation Mindfuck. This is our attempt to bring more Chaos to the world we live in. Creatingmore chaos and confusion is the greatest single thing we can do for Eris. The more apparentchaos, the more confusion, which leads to disorder and a smile from Eris. Operation Mindfuckcan be almost any act of purposeful chaos. For example: handing out a hundred scrolls that say\"You are a Pope\", or declaring war of a friendly guild and killing them to a man (then of coursebringing them back to life), or arranging skins in crop circle reminiscent patterns in the middle ofnowhere and then explaining to any passers-by that you were just abducted by aliens or fairies orsomething, or starting a petition to Lord British for pizza delivery throughout the realm. Just afew suggestions, but hopefully you get the picture. The shock or confusion factor helps peoplebreak out of their usual brain patterns (i. e. brain firmly in the off position) and when the newimprint results from chaos, well, they've just been reborn much closer to Eris, whether or notthey know it. It is important for the Priests of Eris to work closely with the other E. L. F.factions. They must be included in Operation Mindfuck, we can't do it all ourselves, in factPriests should encourage others in the guild to pursue OMF on their own at anytime. Be it alsoknow that at anytime, in ANY E. L. F. member should have an Operation Mind fuck scheme heor she may do whatever is needed to bring the plan to fruition.

The rising of wind, thegathering of clouds, are as they should be; so too the rolling of thunder, the fall of rain, and so on, without end.The operations of ERIS are mysterious. They resemble the actions of the potter, whose wheel forever goesround and round. In the natural succession of change, creations are finished and polished, and afterwardsdissolve again into their pristine elements.Those who do not interfere and leave nothing undone are in harmony with ERIS; those who speak with careunderstand power; those who know tranquillity and are content, devoid of conceit, are in possession ofharmony, even though they live in the midst of a myriad diversities. All things are in accordance with theirvarious natures.The energy of CHAOS operates in the smallest thing and yet compels the mighty universe. Its power molds theuniverse and harmonizes the masculine and feminine, the light and the dark; it forms the four seasons andbrings the elements of nature into accord.The benign and gentle breath of ERIS cherishes all things, both living and not living; it enriches vegetation withmoisture, and permeates stone and metal; it causes the growth of all creatures, giving to one rich and glossy fur,to another abundant plumage. Through its powers embryos mature and creatures are born.Because of ERIS fathers do not mourn the untimely death of their children, nor does the elder brother that of hisyounger brother; the young are not left as orphans, nor is the wife a widow. The misplaced rainbow will neverappear, nor destructive comets cross the sky, because of the harmonious nature of ERIS.Five Ages of ManWith due apologies to Socrates and PlatoThe scene opens with Thuddipius (the clueless) meeting Eristotle (the Chaosopher) at his favorite hot dog cart,attempting to pay homage to the Goddess.THUDDIPIUS: Is it not impious to eat hot dog buns, Eristotle?ERISTOTLE: Do not believe everything you read, Thuddipius.

The name of this age isBureaucracy, and for most men it lasts until the moment of death.T: I must disagree with my earlier statement, I fear. It seems to me that many men change their opinions duringtheir lives.E: This is so, but do many men change how they think, or attempt to think without using Reason?T: This seems as nonsense, Eristotle.E: It most surely is. Reason is what limits the unlimited and what bars it from the primal Chaos from which wecame. Reason is what chains us to the cave, Thuddipius. The chain of Bureaucracy is heavy, but a few manageto crane their necks around to try to see the light from outside the cave. These few reach the edges of Reasonand sight a new landscape. As Reason becomes inadequate and Bureaucracy crumbles, they enter the Age of theAftermath, which leads them back to the primal Chaos. For most men, though, the Aftermath only occurs atdeath, when the body crumbles and the soul is freed from Reality and once again joins with Chaos.T: You are a loon, Eristotle. I don't know why I ask you anything.E: I am a loon, Thuddipius, and you ask me things because, deep down inside, you are, too.

When I get home I shallmake my lunch, and then tidy up, because tidiness is neat!\"He continued to think \"Neat tidiness, tidy neatness, Neat Neatness, tidy tidiness. . . \"When he got home, though, his state of mind was again phase reversed. Another mob had run over his home, ontheir way to the Elvis concert.\"DOUBLE-PLUS-NOT-NEAT!!!!\" Screeched Fleertup the recently not so happy. \"OHMYOHMYOHMY!\"sobbed Fleertup. Two homes in two days. What would he ever do?Just then, the Beautiful woman appeared again, in a spiffy tennis outfit. She was bouncing her apple on theracket. \"Hello, again. I was passing by again, when I saw the wreck. Why don't you build a new house, over theother way a bit. Make it out of bricks and mortar. I'm off to the courts. \"\"Oh! O. K. \" Fleertup waved again as she faded, and then got to work. First he made some brick forms, and ahuge fire to kiln the bricks in. When he had made enough of them, he dug into the earth until he found thecalcium carbonate that he needed, along with more clay and sand. Kilning the calcium carbonate tomake lime, he mixed them together to make cement. Then he built his new home, carefully lining up the bricksto make neat rows, staggering each subsequent row, because it looked nice. He finished with the chimney.He moved all of his things into the new house, made a meal, played with his crayons and paper, and read aboutthe aardvark until he got sleepy, then went to bed.The next day, Fleertup the happy Pig awoke from his nap to a thumping sound outside his nice new home. Helooked out the double-paned insulated glass windows that he had made early that morning, to see thousands ofdrunken men in white suits with large collars, stumbling around, and occassionally running into the house. Theybounced off.\"Oh, goody, no-one is wrecking my home and making it disorderly!\"Just then, there was a glow in his peripheral vision, and Fleertup turned to see that The Beautiful woman hadcome back.\"Oh, hello, Beautiful Woman! No one has wrecked my nice new home, everything is nice and orderly!\"\"No, no it's not. \" She smiled. She ran her finger across one of the table, picking up a few grains of dust. Sheshowed it to Fleertup.\"Even when you clean and clean and clean, the dust will come back. Even when you clean up some dust, whenyou shake out the rags outside, the dust goes into the air and some goes onto your clothes, to be carried backinside. Even when you shine you pots, the dirt mixes with the water and cleanser to make something even morechaotic than before. Every act of putting things in order leaves a little trail of disorder behind it. \"Her Eyes shined. \"And it's all because of me!\"Fleertup, being the order seeking pig he was, couldn't take this anymore. His little mind snapped, and he ran tothe kitchen to shine the pots. He shined and shined, until eventually, he wore the pots away to nothing. Then hestarted washing his hands. . .?. . . . !. . . . ?. . . !. . . ?. . !. . ?. !. ?. !. ?!?!?!?!?!?This is the Secret of Illumination\"And in the End, the Love you take is Equal to the Love you bring\".Hail Eris, All Hail Discordia!!!!!Free at last, free at last.
