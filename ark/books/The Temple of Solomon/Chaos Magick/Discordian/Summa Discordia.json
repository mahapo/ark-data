I almost didn't put the Summa together because of the Principia. For a while, I was afraid that it would be too much like its predecessor, then too different. After all, the Principia set the standard. It created the Movement. It essentially created Eris from Nothing. Or so I thought. The Truth is, we created Eris from nothing. The original book was written, 'nuff respect, but that was forty-odd years ago. The world has changed now. For one thing, there are a lot more Discordians. We've spent time and energy taking Discordianism and running with it. We've had pointless discussions, written very bad poetry, made inappropriate jokes, embarrassed our loved ones - all in the name of Eris. We've also looked at things a little differently. Chaos got re-filed from primordial evil to the ol' briar patch (just as we suspected). Obedience got moved from virtue to vice. And faith? Have faith your socks are where you left them. Unless the puppy got there first. Another thing has changed in the past thirty years - our situation is definitely Greyer. The counterculture that spawned the Principia got repackaged to sell minivans, with the irony removed for Your Dining Enjoyment.

A “Beatus” is someone who has been “beatified” by the Roman Catholic Church, which means they figure you're in heaven and it's ok to toss your name into the hopper for Sainthood. Since I am not Catholic (any more,) and not dead (yet), I decided to beatify myself and beat the holiday rush. For what it's worth, the Principia Discordia points out that choosing Holy Names isn't unique to Discordians, citing the example of Pope Paul IV not being born to Mr. and Mrs. IV.

Eris, it seems, was always pulling kooky stunts that confused the Greeks (and consequently the Romans, since they weren't too keen on original thought. As a matter of fact, the Romans didn't even bother to get to know Eris any better - they just renamed her \"Discordia\"). As a result, the ancients had a pretty negative attitude about Her. It was only in modern times (since there are so few ancients around any more) that She revealed to us her true nature. *The PARATHEO-ANAMETAMYSTIKHOOD OF ERIS ESOTERIC is a pretty easy religion, as far as religions go. You don't have to sacrifice much (unless you count indulging in a few games of sink, and that's not even mandatory).

Luckily for you, this isn't some fly-by-night set of Discordian pages - we have more versions of the book than you can shake a stick at. This Eris stuff - is it for real? That's a good question.

But Ffungo - what about [your God here]? Won't (S)He be pissed? Just because you're hung up on some other god doesn't mean that Eris has nothing for you.

That's not the worst of it, though. What does he like? What does he really really hate? I bet there'll be a pretty high correlation between His tastes and yours. See, part of the problem is that God is a really really big Thing. Probably a little too big for our purposes. We try to make Him a little smaller, a little more recognizable, a little more like, well, us. Trouble is, we end up with a model of our own ego as a God. That's where Eris can help. She can shake up our GodModel a little. Not an old man - a woman, and a hottie at that. Not staid and serious - a hell-raiser. Not overly concerned that you're having fun - mad that you're taking so few chances. Mix up the GodModel a bit every now and then to make sure that someone other than you is involved.

Discordianism doesn't work that way. It all goes back to the Steve Wright koan that says \"You can't have everything. Where would you put it?\" The answer is, of course, \"Right where it is!\" Think of everything as One Big Thing, then realize that the bigger a thing becomes, the more it becomes like the One Big Thing. Another way to say it is that the Establishment always sucks, and the only real seat of creative energy is in the opposition. Look at the music.

Describing any belief system in 50 words or less can only result in something ridiculous - \"Umm, well, see, I believe that there was this guy named Jesus, right, and he was really God in human form and he says that if you do good things your soul will go to a paradise after you die, but if you do bad things you'll be tortured for all eternity.\" Besides, even those descriptions don't really answer the question. While that response sums up some of the trappings of Christianity, it ignores a lot of the flavor of Christianity - the works of charity and the atrocities it has inspired, the world view it assumes, and the kind of people it attracts. In order to really answer the question, you have to look at a religion exo-memetically. That is, you have to go beyond the thing-in-itself and examine all of the effects it has and the beliefs it indirectly supports. These are just as telling as the official dogmas; for example, Christianity has an official tenet that a wealthy person should give money to the poor and needy, but many denominations today view wealth as a sign of God's approval and downplay the charitable aspect (have you watched TBN lately?). A short-answer description of Discordianism is especially difficult, since one of its Most Hallowed Beliefs is that it's dumb to have Any Hallowed Beliefs. As a matter of fact, I'll probably get excommunicated for making the following list, but I'm willing to make that sacrifice for you, Beloved Reader."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"(Besides, I'll just get a buddy of mine to de-excommunicate me. I could do it myself, of course, but it's considered poor form.) The Discordian Worldview The world around us is a chaotic place, first and foremost. That means there isn't any purpose to life, no divine plan for each one of us, and a person doesn't get hit by a bus because \"it was his time to go\" but because \"the idiot didn't watch where he was going\". Therefore, we see meaning as something imposed from without rather than an endogenous aspect of reality. Just because the world is a chaotic place doesn't mean that it won't \"tell\" you things sometimes - it just means that you should be aware that it is telling everybody something a little different, and the answers you have may work nicely for you, but they aren't the Universally Correct answers that are written in the back of some celestial Book. What kind of person is drawn to Discordianism? Usually weirdos. How should Discordians behave? Well, we have a real problem with the word \"should\", because people usually use should like \"I am better than you, and therefore I say that you should ....\" Legally speaking, there are no de jure Discordian \"shoulds\", but there are a lot of de facto ones. As far as issues of morality are concerned, it's pretty wide open.

And, unless you feel like wasting it, freedom means becoming something, making choices, and taking responsibility for all the choices you make. If you are still spending your life just getting by, eating-and-excreting, then you don't quite Get It. What is the flavor of Discordian discourse? It tastes like chicken. Ok - it's largely irreverent and iconoclastic, with a strong dada component. There are a lot of mystical and/or paranoid references and a conspicuous amount of Unnecessary Capitalization. How seriously should we take all of this? Of course, we don't recommend taking anything very seriously. People usually ask me this question, though, because they're trying to figure out if I think there really is an Eris somewhere who is a Goddess and does Goddess-type things. This is especially complicated by contemporary Christianity, which teaches us that there is a God who is paying attention to you every moment of every day and who responds pretty much like a person - you can make him mad, if you get lippy he'll probably do something bad to you to put you in your place, etc. God as a magnification of the Self.

The Defamation League (who secretly controls almost all organized religion and Goddess knows what else) has been secretly costuming cabbages and trying to pass them off as humans.

They exist for very specific reasons. Now, other belief systems say that the Big Kahuna God (Jehova, Allah, Krishna, Ahramazda, whomever) set up a place that sucks to test the faithful. In our disbelief system, however, we know better than that. The Region exists for many reasons, such as the influence of Greyface and his Orders of Discordia, divine retrubution for the Original Snub, etc. However, it survives and thrives primarily because it acts as a memetic dragchute. "},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"Definition of Memetics Time: >Oversimplification mode ON Memetics is a theory that says that ideas are transmitted like viruses, and that some people are more susceptible to certain idea-viruses (\"memes\") than others. When new ideas come along, you might pick them up if you don't have a stronger, conflicting meme. If you tell all of your friends about it, you can help spread it. Any group or society has a large \"meme pool\" that most members share. This pool has faced evolutional pressure for quite some time, and can sustain and protect itself pretty well (for instance, the \"patriotism\" meme allows governments to make people do what they want, such as attacking \"commies\" or \"terrorists\" (read: \"those with competing memetic structures\"), thus protecting itself from contrary memes). As memes change (through mutation or \"corruption\" from outside memes), the new structures either replace the old, or get squished by it, and evolution marches on. (That's all the memetic theory you'll get here. If you want more, you'll have to go somewhere else.) >Oversimplification mode OFF Ok - sorry about that. Anyway, the concept of a \"meme pool\" is largely metaphorical - it consists of all the ideas that are generally held and accepted. These ideas, however, are not necessarily the best ideas - they are the ones that have best survived. This is a critical difference. For instance, when a certain species of bee decides to do the nasty, the males' reproductive organs literally eject and plug the female. This process kills the male, but it makes damn sure his genes propagate. Evolution doesn't give a rat's ass whether or not the bee is a Do Bee and makes his world a groovy place - if his reproductive method isn't best, he doesn't get a genetic vote. "},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"In the same manner, memetic evolution doesn't reward the most useful, beautiful, or valuable ideas. It rewards ONLY the most fecund ones. If you are a meme that can fill a specific niche and you can spread 100 times more quickly than your competitor, you win! You become part of the meme pool, one of the commonly accepted memes. You become reality. You become True. Our memetic pool has been stewing for a long time now. Along the way, people have managed to slip in their own memes (and some have just fallen in accidentally) so that this pool is as murky and smelly as any public pool ever has been. Every one of these memes is a survivor, and therefore, every one of them is considered True. And do the cabbages protect this pool? Try tweaking some of the most peripheral memes and see what kind of response you get. And I'm not talking about God, Flag, and Mother - some of the truly insignificant ones, like: ∑ \"I think that the Walt Disney Company is a truly evil organization.\" ∑ \"Bestiality laws are kind of strange - I mean, if you can cut your pig into pieces and eat it, shouldn't you be able to screw it?\" ∑ \"If you can say 'fuck' on HBO, why can't you say it on NBC?\" My prediction? Nearly every Thuddite you say something like this to will react with a mixture of disgust and confusion - disgust, because what you're saying is wrong, and confusion, because they're not completely sure why. If you press these arguments with them, 99% of the Thuddites will not be able to carry on past the second or third exchange, and will probably end up wrinkling up their noses and dismissing you as crazy. Which you are, since crazy is defined as \"not buying the same shit that Normal People do\"."},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":" So, you go about your business, trying to fuck with Thuddites as little as possible (except for the ones that really have it coming), you try to associate with like minded people (both Discordians and people who don't realize that they're really Discordians), and you try to set up a small area of the Region where you can live in peace. But then you notice....like the beginning of a nightmare.....you're starting to get surrounded by Thuddites!!! Maybe you were in a cool neighborhood coffee shop, when you noticed a clean, antiseptic Starbuck's springing up in every strip mall with space for rent. Maybe you were listening to alternative music when you started noticing that more and more bands were calling themselves \"Alternative\" but sounding more and more mainstream. Maybe the cutting-edge radio or TV show you loved suddenly and unaccountably got popular, and slowly lost its fire as its audience grew. It's happening You see, since we are all connected to the world around us, we are influenced by the actions of others. There are some people who are real Humans, but are so surrounded by disguised cabbages that they behave like THEM, instead of the other way around. Every once in a while, one of these humans sees a New Cool Thing and is drawn to it. It seems attractive to them, but still a little alien to their Cabbage-like tastes. So they water it down a step - make it just a touch less alien. Pretty soon, even cabbages can stand to hang there. Just as barnacles cling to a ship's hull and encumber it, so do Thuddites accrete to \"new\" things. Like cells attacking an infection, they slowly bring the new thing back in. Coffee houses end up being Burger Kings that sell coffee. Alternative starts morphing into cock-rock. Beavis doesn't set things on fire anymore (note: the"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"effect has not been as pronounced on Beavis and Butt-Head soley due to Beavis's status as a Prophet). By assimilating these things, they become less and less threatening to the Thuddites, until they're quite simply the same as everything else in the Region. But Ffungo, What CanWe Do?

It works through a principle known as the Functionality of the Strange. Pope Icky Fundament over at Hyperdiscordia has carefully documented some case studies of \u0018 \b put into action under the name Guerrilla Surrealism.

It was the reason that the earliest humans decided to focus their attentions on the spiritual beyond. Chaos is, almost by definition, something that is not controlled, and therefore seems inseparably related to the divine. Our truest sense of chaos originates from the awareness that we are faced with a universe of unimaginable complexity. At the same time, there is a more practical side to this drive toward worship. This pull to the divine was always followed by the need to propitiate these unimaginably powerful forces, since so little in this world seemed under our control. Cave paintings weren't just decorative - they were part of ritualistic performances to ensure a successful hunt. The fertility icons found in Catal Huyuk were trusted to ensure a plentiful harvest and large family. We've come a long way since those days. We're better than that now. We're smarter, for one, and we're stronger. We have technology that can predict and control a good part of that mysterious void that was nature. The products of our society are not just works of art that hope at influence over nature, but massive dams, roads, buildings, ships, aircraft - acts of technical dominance over nature. We're stronger now. We're powerful. We're safer. Except we're still afraid of chaos. Sometimes we can cover it up by wrapping ourselves in order, in the understood. Throw up the walls of technology, of medicine, of science, of logic. We can drop a veil around ourselves, saying, \"I understand everything. That which I don't understand is therefore nothing,\" and doing this rids us of the larger, more troubling part of the world. A smacks into B and causes C, and with a little more study and a little hard work we can cause C on command."},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":" But Discordians have this all figured out. We worship Eris, the Goddess of Chaos. And she's let us in on the Big Secret. You see, the Fallacy of Chaos is that it exists at all.

Everything is everything. Bundi ti ubundi. You know you're close to understanding Chaos when you either see it everywhere or nowhere, but you're not sure which.

We have grand dreams, vague ideas about how we'd like things to be, but we often lack the vision to chart a clear course from Here to There. Of course, not everybody is like this. Much has been made in our histories about the singular effect that people of Will can accomplish through direct action. And, while they do things like climb Mount Everest or cure polio, we are also encouraged to strive in our own small, sad way - to buy a sports utility vehicle, to climb from a degrading, powerless rung on the corporate ladder to a more degrading and marginally less powerless rung, etc. But whether we pursue their shitty goals or our Noble ones, the outcome is largely the same. Unless we have a clear idea of each step between where we are and where we want to be, it seems really hard to make any progress. Part of this difficulty, though, is based on the assumption that you need to have intimate knowledge of the entire path to reach your destination, which clearly isn't true. We often find ourselves in serendipitous situations that we didn't plan for in"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"exact detail. Instead of looking at our goals as points in a hedge maze, we should see them as mountains. Sure, the exact path to the summit may not be clear from where you're standing, but hell - the mountain is very clearly Over There, and it doesn't take a sextant to figure out that you should probably head toward it instead of away from it. What's more, you often don't even need to be able to see the mountain the whole time. Listening to yourself very carefully, you can often use the same navigation system in your life that birds and butterflies use to cross hemispheres. If you try this approach, you'll be surprised by how often it just seems to work. The reason for this is, of course, a well-established point of Discordian Philosophy. We know that for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction. But what most of us haven't been told is that every pointless action has an equal and opposite reaction, which means that, the more pointless the action, the more specifically pointed the reaction. This fact should not be lost on those who are paying attention. Now, if an action is designed in a specifically pointless way to bring about a pointed reaction, this will, of course, not work. (The active principle in these cases is the Law of Negative Reversal; the proof is left as an exercise for the student.) Still, however, the careful application of activities (or groups of activities) with no cohesive direction will almost certainly fail to bring about a specific response, but do so in such a way that the opposite fails to not occur. Examples of this abound in the Region of Thud. "},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"The Functionality of the Strange is really a quite liberating concept. We can, to some extent, choose our own fates, but there is a great deal that is quite simply out of our control, and that's a really good thing.

The Beatus Ffungo: Ok, to start with, what's your opinion about Christianity? I mean, you played a pretty major role in its early development. J: Yeah, but that was a long time ago. It's become such a, well, such an institution since then. It's like people pay more attention to the way Christianity was 50 years ago and look to that for the authority. The Spirit is pretty much confined to sideshow tricks. TBF: Ok, you touched on a number of things there. Let's hit the institution thing first. Some people think that the capital-C Church may have peaked six or seven centuries ago, and with the whole nation-state thing, the institutional side may be – J: No, no, that's not really... By \"institutional\", I'm talking more about how people look to icons for guidance instead of the Spirit. I mean, the trappings of the institution, which used to be giant cathedrals and are now office parks and TV studios, have only changed form. The true nature of the institutional side is its self-perpetuating, unchallengeable nature. I mean, these people took some first century writings that were hand picked for largely political reasons two hundred years later, decided that they contained some kind of fixed \"meaning\", and said that anyone who thought otherwise was wrong and dangerous."},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"All of this while the Spirit is right here. Right here! TBF: Sometimes I feel like people are afraid to trust themselves enough to make that trip themselves. J: Exactly, but people are even afraid to realize what tremendous power they have. Like all those healings, right? All through Israel in the early days, in Africa a few hundred years later. I kept telling these people \"Your faith has healed you,\" and what did they do? They completely blew that off and said, \"Oh no, you have healed me! Let me follow you around and ignore my own development.\" I mean, how did Matthew put it? \"If you have faith as small as a mustard seed, you can say to this mountain, `Move from here to there' and it will move. Nothing will be impossible for you.\" But they still look at themselves as these empty cups that the Spirit either chooses to fill or leaves empty and worthless.

J: I don't know, maybe.... maybe as [Charleton Heston impression] \"As mighty eagles, and the Spirit as a breeze that lifts them.\" TBF: Mighty eagles? J:[laughs] Well, something like that. The point is, it's not a passive thing. TBF: Ok, what about the early evangelists? What do you think of their treatment of you in the Gospels? J: [takes a deep drag] That's kind of hard to say, because these guys - and they were all pretty good guys, for the most part - these guys try to take the things that I said and did and use them as the basis for their writing.

They completely ignore the fact that this stuff was written in another language millennia ago. They treat the \"traditional\" interpretation like it's the only possible one - like the Gehenna-equals-Hell thing - ignoring the fact that they're not getting their beliefs from the Bible, but from a bunch of guys who claim that their interpretation of the Bible is the only correct one. J: [stubs out cigarette, lights another] Heh heh heh. Yeah, I know that bugs you. But one thing you have to remember, Ffungo, is that these people are buying this stuff because it rings True to them. It doesn't matter if it's not historically iron-clad. It appeals to their sense of justice, it appeals to their need for love, and, most importantly, it allows them to participate in the Divine. So it's not your gig, well, that's gonna happen. Just try to play nice, you know? And besides - look at Revelations. I mean, that's a great book, even though people are really missing the obvious. TBF: Well, what do you think about the charge that, if you ever \"came back\", that Christians would kill you this time? J: Oh, the Dostoevsky thing? I dunno. Maybe.

Most people who are drawn to it usually get their start out of frustration with more \"traditional\" religions (although, technically speaking, ours outdates several of today's more popular heresies). Most people don't really understand the official tenets of their religion, and they're generally happy with that. Unfortunately, they don't seem to understand that others need their religion to make a little more sense or abandon any attempt at making sense altogether - which is where Discordianism comes in. That's also why Discord plays such a significant role in Discordianism (besides merely making up 53.8% of the logo). And it's larger than just religion - most Discordians come here as the result of the discord between people who accept a standard view of things and those that don't. And, let's face it, we're all fully aware of how people respond to us when we choose not to take their Truth seriously. Many Discordians go beyond that and actively seek conflict with those minions of Greyface in the world. And why shouldn't we?

There was this little kid whuppin' ass on a bigger kid in a Power Rangers suit! It was great - the little kid had the big kid's arm & was spinning him around, and the big kid was stumbling all over & fell down. The big kid's mask was so tweaked that he couldn't see anything. When I was little & kids picked on me, they just wore normal clothes (well, if you could consider Led Zepplin t-shirts normal) that offered me very little in the way of a tactical advantage. Maybe they should make bullies wear sombreros, so you could pull them down over their eyes in a scuffle (and besides - they'd look so dorky in them that it could discourage some of them from following the path of bullydom). I immediately sympathized with the littler kid, but maybe the big kid was just exploring his inner power ranger when the small kid, who was actually 19 and stunted from smoking filterless Camels, came over and decided to pick on the Power Ranger kid just because he was different.

I gotta say, however, that I'd guess that Altoids, while possessing superior mintiness, may NOT be able to out-fresh the Freshmaker. \"Mintiness\" is a dimension that can increase without bound, but \"freshness\" is the result of a number of different attributes in a delicate balance. Altoids may be too minty for their own freshness. Even though this is something that Rob should probably do (what with him being the TechSaint and all), I will venture forth this evening and procure both Altoids and Mentos for systematic scientific trials.

Subject: Results of the Mentos Challenge Date: Thu, 29 Jan 1998 07:09:31 -0800 From: ffungo@ev1.net To: COBAL List Here are the results of my highly scientific experiment: Item #1: Altoids Appearance: Like somebody made them in their basement. The tin is nice, though, and the tissue inside the tin adds to the anticipation (which is why you should make undressing part of the act, but that's a different experiment). Flavor: Mint. And by that, I don't mean \"minty\", but \"MINT, GODDAMMIT!\" They are the Platonic ideal of mintiness."},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"Freshness: I think that the depths of my sinuses were fresh. Everything South of that had pegged the mintometer. Item #2: Mentos (Mint Flavor) Appearance: You know what they look like. In the interest of accuracy, I tried to eat them like those lovable Mentos kids on TV. I paused, adpoted a look that was pensive, determined, yet suffused with a joi-de-vivre, then flipped a Mento into my mouth with my thumb. I got a small amount of foil the first time, but with practice I perfected the technique. Flavor: A more reasonable minty flavor. They are, however, the chewable mint, and by chewable they mean \"sticky enough to yank the fillings from your teeth.\" Freshness: Pretty good, really. I put away half of a tube in one of those late-night number crunching sessions. If I had tried that with Altoids, I would have started to bleed through the eyes. I also had Indian food last night, so there were two times where I had one of those puke-burps, and Mentos were able to quickly but gently overpower the unpleasantness. Item #3: Mentos (Fruit Flavor) Appearance: Like the Real Deal, but more colorful. Flavor: Various fruit flavors, with varying effects. The lemon was ok, but the strawberry.... well, let's just say that strawberry Mentos are to strawberry flavor what Altoids are to mint. Freshness: Ok, but not as fresh as the Mint Mentos. I put away half a tube of these too (like I said, it was a tough night) and, while I didn't get that \"skittle\"d-over feeling, it was close. In short, Fruit Mentos are ok, but eat them for schlock value rather than fruity freshness. Altoids are acceptable for use by large men and small cattle.

For what it's worth, the Principia points out that the choosing of Holy Names isn't unique to Discordians, citing the example of Pope Paul IV failing to be born of Mr. and Mrs. IV. Exactly why we do this is, like most things in Discordianism, is somewhat unclear. Some maintain that we were named after Thuddites, so changing names is the only reasonable thing to do. Others think that giving yourself a silly name can help you remember that taking yourself too seriously is a Big Sin. Then, there's the contingent that thinks it's all just a big laugh. Of course, all views are considered Doctrinally Correct. In any case, the choosing of a name is a very powerful event, which is why we recommend doing as often as possible. Names are really just Magick Words that we associate with actual items that can trap them by defining them. Since we're going to be trapped like this anyway, there is value in doing it ourselves - it gives us more control, and it's kind of a kick. There are actually many different levels of naming, or claiming an identity: Declaration of Existence The simplest level of naming occurs when something is named just to show that it exists. When Jehova was talking to Moses in that whole burning bush scene, Moses asked him for some I.D. Exodus 3:14. \"And God said unto Moses, I AM THAT I AM: and he said, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, I AM hath sent me unto you.\" In other words, he was just saying that he existed, and that was enough"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"for a bunch of people to follow Charlton Heston into the desert. Or something. Declaration of Exclusion A second level occurs when the claimed identity is used to distinguish oneself from something else, defined or not. Calling oneself a \"Discordian\" is a claim that excludes certain traits and beliefs, unless you're a snivling hypocritical sack of shit (a.k.a. \"Those Who Disagree With Me\"). This exclusionary statement of identity has been used most effectively by the great Prophet Popeye, who frequently says, \"I yam what I yam and that's all what I yam!\". Note how Popeye cleverly expands upon the work of Jehova, who came much earlier (c. 4500 years). Declaration of Identity This highest level of naming is the one performed by Discordians everywhere when they quit being John Doe and start being The Right Reverend Blotto von Crockstein. In the previous levels, the identity is hidden behind declarative statments - \"I exist\" and \"I am unique\". In this level, the true Magick of the name stands alone - no defining claims are needed. Indeed, the sense of identity can just be forming, in which case the identity is a goal, an active attempt at becoming one's own avatar. This is most clearly demonstrated in the Prophet Beavis, when he declares, \"I am Cornholio!\". No further explanation should be required. So there you have it. Seize the metaphysical High Ground and give yourself a name. What the hell - give yourself some cool titles too.

(But since this is in print now we’ll ignore that comment). One of the key points of Discordianism is the subject of Chaos - Eris is the Goddess of Chaos, and most other religions seem designed to explain away Chaos as illusion, as an obscuration of Someone's Divine Plan. I had expected Discordians to believe that Chaos for Chaos's sake was good, and any kind of order was bad. That's why I was stoked when I found the following passage in the Principia: The Aneristic Principle is that of APPARENT ORDER; the Eristic Principle is that of APPARENT DISORDER. Both order and disorder are man made concepts and are artificial divisions of PURE CHAOS, which is a level deeper that is the level of distinction making. With our concept making apparatus called \"mind\" we look at reality through the ideas-about-reality which our cultures give us. The ideas-about-reality are mistakenly labeled \"reality\" and unenlightened people are forever perplexed by the fact that other people, especially other cultures, see \"reality\" differently. It is only the ideas-about-reality which differ. Real (capital-T True) reality is a level deeper that is the level of concept. We look at the world through windows on which have been drawn grids (concepts). Different philosophies use different grids. A culture is a group of people with rather similar grids. Through a window we view chaos, and relate it to the points"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"on our grid, and thereby understand it. The ORDER is in the GRID. That is the Aneristic Principle. As George Santayana says, \"Chaos is a name for any order that produces confusion in our minds.\" I really dug this! Like any Good Discordian-In-The-Making, I already didn't decide to believe something I read just because it was in a book I liked, but because it made sense to me. I make it a habit to listen occasionally to one of the local Christian radio stations (which, as you might guess, generally espouses views that are somewhat more conservative than my own). It never ceases to amaze me how many people call up and say that everybody on the planet knows that their (intolerant, uneducated, and benighted, IMHO) beliefs are true and it's just the Liberal Media's fault that they aren't in total control. A great example of two \"grids\" that filter the same information in a radically different way. More Principia: Western philosophy is traditionally concerned with contrasting one grid with another grid, and amending grids in hopes of finding a perfect one that will account for all reality and will, hence, (say unenlightened westerners) be True. This is illusory; it is what we Erisians call the ANERISTIC ILLUSION. Some grids can be more useful than others, some more beautiful than others, some more pleasant than others, etc., but none can be more True than any other. DISORDER is simply unrelated information viewed through some particular grid. But, like \"relation\", no-relation is a concept. Male, like female, is an idea about sex. To say that male-ness is \"absence of female-ness\", or vice versa, is a matter of definition and metaphysically arbitrary. The artificial concept of no-relation is the ERISTIC PRINCIPLE. "},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"The belief that \"order is true\" and disorder is false or somehow wrong, is the Aneristic Illusion. To say the same of disorder, is the ERISTIC ILLUSION. The point is that (little-t) truth is a matter of definition relative to the grid one is using at the moment, and that (capital-T) Truth, metaphysical reality, is irrelevant to grids entirely. Pick a grid, and through it some chaos appears ordered and some appears disordered. Pick another grid, and the same chaos will appear differently ordered and disordered. Bingo! Many other belief systems had an exclusion meme built in - \"This and no other\", which seemed absurd to me, since those belief systems were clearly transmitted by culture - something that should be no obstacle to Universal Truth. I'm not a Bible-thumping Southern Baptist for the same reason I'm not Jewish, Muslim, Hindu, or Shinto - because I wasn't raised in that environment. It always seemed to me that the different religions all had some value to them, and saying \"What I have here happens to be, fortunately for me, the One True Answer, and the belief systems that everybody else has used for inspiration, motivation, and enlightenment are wrong, worthless, and potentially harmful\" seems stupid. It also seemed like a bad idea to reject religion, for the same reason. For all the grandstanding and intolerance that is credited to religion, there are also episodes like the one I read about in the Utne Reader, where a group of skinheads was throwing bricks through the windows of houses with Stars of David in their windows, so a local woman convinced her whole (Christian) congregation to display the Stars in their windows too, and eventually the stars-to-rascist-assholes ratio was just too high."},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":" So, you may ask, what is the A-1, Official, Not Available in Stores Ffungo-Approved Cabaret Discordia Approach to all this religion business?

The problem is that Eris is a very busy Goddess and doesn't have time to muck about in the petty matters of the world, unless it makes for a good time. Approaching her directly isn't going to amount to much. "},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"This is actually pretty good news, though. Prayer basically assumes that you have a better idea what should be going on than She What Is In Charge, and you're kind enough to let Her in on the secret. Even though calling Divine attention to your own hubris is a good way of making your situation more interesting for onlookers, it's still a riskier path than most of us would like to follow. The Discordian outlook on prayer, then, can only help. It says, \"Hey, pal, you don't like it? Either deal with it or git off yer lazy ass and do something about it.\" But what about those situations when, despite the risk, you just feel you need a little assist from Beyond? Fortunately, other religions have done the leg work here and figured out what to do in situations where your God/dess can't be bothered by your petty desires - INTERCESSIONS! Intercessions, quite simply, are when you ask somebody else to pray for you. (It seems that God/desses are notoriously poor bookkeepers and are actually quite vulnerable to polling box frauds such as this one.) Unless you're stupid as well as needy, you'll get some high powered saint, demigod, or spirit that specializes in whatever problem you're having (\"St. Jephrehad of the Itchy Bottom, Ora Pro Nobis...\"). That way, you can go about your business secure in the knowledge that somebody else is shouldering the burden of your entreaties. "},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"Q. But Ffungo, does it really work? A. Well, maybe, maybe not. You may be praying for inner peace or enlightenment, in which case your prayer could be a form of meditation and could very well work. Or, you could be trying to work the Santa Claus angle (getting the Big Being Upstairs to kowtow to your will and give you whatever your greedy little heart desires), in which case you'll find that things either happen or don't. Either way, though, if you sucker someone else into pulling the load, they'll get tagged if your chosen Deity is having a Bad Day - it's a win-win for you! Q. Ok, Ffungo, assuming that I buy this, whom should we get to Ora Pro Nobis? A. Well, personally, I prefer to ask the following types: ∑ Celebrities - but only cool ones, not lame soap opera stars and such. Ask Liz Phair to help you with that destructive relationship, Timothy Leary to help you find good drugs, or Dennis Miller to help you find a witty rejoinder to that smug asshole who dissed you in front of people. ∑ Fictional Characters - preferably from cartoons. Bugs Bunny will always be more real than Humbert Humbert, simply because we have seen the former and have had to imagine the latter. (If this is wrong, and there is a cartoon version of Lolita out there, please let me know.) ∑ Actual Saints - Discordian ones are a little chancy - these guys will probably tell Eris that you want her to turn all of your underwear into green steel wool just for a laugh. If you want ones from Major Religions, I suggest ones like St. Christopher, who was later determined to be fictional."},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"The Beatus Ffungo - I have no supernatural powers (and limited natural ones) - hell, I'm not even a Saint yet, but I'd be glad to take a stab at it out of Discordian Neighborliness If you get any really good results, let me know about it.

With the tacit help of almost everyone around you, there are people who are trying to take that most sacred of things, your mind, and re-write it. Force it to mutate into an abomination, a grotesque, a genetically-engineered microorganism that secretes the miracle drug, the production of which is the only reason you've been allowed to live. You produce only two things of any interest - your money and your servility. They amplify your fears and insecurities, pervert your lusts and desires, and mutilate your curiosity and beauty to buy themselves sports cars or cement their authority. And it's a pretty lucrative system, too - try to buck it and you'll see what I mean. It's not enough to say, \"You go your way and I'll go mine\". It's not even enough to act just like them.

It's easier to see if you go from the outside-in. Look at the Middle East - Jews and Moslems gunning each other down, blowing up innocent children (even though both of their gods tell them not to) because they know that not Believing is a worse crime than murder. They know this, of course, because some evil fuck somewhere played to their fears. Wait - that's overplaying it; they know this because of a web of fear, shared by their relatives and neighbors and fanned by those who benefit from it. Other examples get even more disgusting. Look at Northern Ireland. These morons are killing each other over membership in two nearly identical sects of Christianity! Is Ulster full of perfectionist theologians? No - everybody's just in agreement that the Other Side is a threat to Our Side, because that's how it is. This mentality isn't just a mentality - it's a way of life, it's an identity, it's Real. Here in America, we still hate the Bad Guys, which we used to call \"Communists\" but now we call \"Drug Pushers\" or \"Terrorists\" or \"Child Pornographers\". Not that these are nice people.

They have so perverted reason that reason must be denied to them.

They determine the forms of dialogue available to us, and - wouldn't you know - they have Home Field Advantage in all of them.

This is also why we sometimes compare our dialogues to taking a shit. The comparison is a sham - we're merely autosabotaging to keep them purblind. Something as foolish as the Cerebus of scatology keeps them from our gates. And so, we weirdoes must keep one set of cards in our hands and another in our heads. We must be able to switch from honest inquiry to ideological vomit with switchblade speed. And so, we weirdoes must perfect their notions of Us and Them. We must commit to causing enough chaos that we can pass among them undetected. We must make Doubt and Uncertainty members of our club so that no one will be able to tell one of us from the other (not by camouflaging ourselves as one of them, but by filling their eyes with such patterns that we elicit no recognition).
