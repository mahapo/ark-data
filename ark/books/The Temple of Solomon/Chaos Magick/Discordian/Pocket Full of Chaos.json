By fnordiscordia Bob, Tommy, and Vince were three ordinary boys who were on their way to a Karate camp in the mountains. Vince had recently gotten his license, so he was the driver. He had just bought a brand new car that he had saved up all throughout high-school in order to afford. Vince’s parents didn’t want him to drive but he insisted on it. Unfortunately, Vince wasn’t ready to make this trip. The mountain roads were soon covered in snow and Vince inevitably lost control of his car, crashing it into a tree. Aside from a few scrapes and bruises, all three boys came away from the accident unharmed. However, the car that Vince had worked so hard for was destroyed and now completely useless. The three were stranded on the mountain with little food and water. The boys decided to split what little food and water they had equally among themselves. Bob decided to consume it all at once. “Better too much than not enough,” he said. Vincent decided that he would consume as little as possible to make it last well into their stay at the camp. Tommy, on the other hand, decided that he would consume only what he needed, not too much, not too little. So, having distributed their food, the boys set off for the camp on foot. Eventually they all made it to the camp, but two of them were a little worse for the wear. Bob was very weak as he had eaten all of his food at the beginning of the trip. Vince was starving from having not eaten enough food. His remaining food, which he refused to share, had spoiled. Tommy was neither weak nor starving because he chose to use moderation. Tommy avoided extremes and was the best off for it. So, what is the moral of this story?

A stimulated hunger, with a built in laxative, would be a true miracle for sufferers of many ailments. A laxative is a preparation used for encouraging defecation, or the elimination of feces. Laxatives are most often taken to treat constipation. Certain stimulant, lubricant, and saline laxatives are used to evacuate the colon for rectal and bowel examinations. Most commonly things such as chemicals and irritants, enemas, drive through Mexican food, and stimulants are used.

The KLF- also known by various other names including The Justified Ancients of Mu Mu, The Timelords, The K Foundation, and 2K - were one of the seminal bands of the British acid house movement during the late 1980s and early 1990s. They gained notoriety for various anarchic situationist manifestations which included billboard advert defacements; a Brit awards protest involving a machine gun, a dead sheep and buckets of blood; highly unique and abnormal performances on Top of the Pops; peculiar mainstream press adverts and regular full page ads in the NME; the staging of an alternative art award for the worst artist of the year; and burning a million pounds sterling.

She was known as the \"First Lady of Country Music\" and one of her best-known songs was \"Stand by Your Man,\" which was one of the biggest selling hit singles by a woman in the history of the music genre. After working various side jobs such as picking cotton, waiting tables, being a receptionist, a barmaid, and working in a shoe factory, she went to beauty school, and became a hairdresser. In 1965 her baby developed spinal meningitis and Wynette tried to make extra money by performing at night. Once famous she had many relationships, most notably with George Jones and CARD CARRYING SUB-GENIUS Burt Reynolds. She also had a number of serious physical ailments beginning in the 1970s, including operations on her gall bladder, kidney and on the nodules on her throat."},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":" In 1988 she filed for bankruptcy as a consequence of a bad investment in two shopping centers. She recorded a song with the British electronica group The KLF in late 1991 titled \"Justified and Ancient (Stand by the JAMs)\", which became a number one hit in eighteen countries the following year. In the video, scrolling electronic titles said that \"Miss Tammy Wynette is the first lady of country music\". Wynette appeared in the video seated on a throne. Although some saw the inclusion of Wynette as a novel ploy for interest to the song - The KLF were well known for scams and stunts - her inclusion was a mark of admiration from The KLF and not an after-thought or marketing scheme. Wynette's vocal performance was brilliant and the song was in all probability one of the superior dance songs of the early 1990s in terms of melodic construction and presentation. In 1992, future First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton said during a 60 Minutes interview that she wasn't \"some little woman, standing by my man, like Tammy Wynette\". The comment set off a firestorm of hullabaloo and Wynette demanded, and received, an apology from Clinton. THE SONG “JUSTIFIED AND ANCIENT” has recently been adopted by Jonesboro’s House of Eris’ Science and Fnord Committee as it’s “house song.” AS FOR MU MU ITSELF: WHAT IS MU!? 1) Mu is a fictional continent in the Cthulhu mythos of H.P. Lovecraft. The lost continent of Mu appears in numerous mythos stories, including many written by Lin Carter. "},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"Mu is a sunken continent in the Pacific Ocean. Before it sank, Mu is believed to be the place where humans first appeared. The ancient Muvians worshipped countless gods, but the most important ones were the three \"sons\" of Cthulhu: Zoth-Ommog, Ghatanothoa, and Ythogtha. It was the Muvian's reverence for this triad of brothers that may have hastened their downfall. There is much speculation about what caused Mu to sink into the ocean. However, the Zanthu Tablets offers the best explanation. According to the tome, the high priest Zanthu angered the Elder Gods when he attempted to summon Ythogtha to challenge the power of Ghatanothoa. In retaliation, the Elder Gods destroyed Mu and sank it beneath the waves. Mount Yaddith-Gho is a towering basalt mountain on the continent of Mu. Its peak is topped with a colossal, ancient, stone fortress which legends claim was built eons ago by a race of beings that came from the planet Yuggoth. Inside the fortress is a huge trapdoor that seals an entryway to the interior of the mountain. More than 200,000 years ago, Mount Yaddith-Gho was situated in the kingdom of Kn'aa. The mountain was sacred because it was the dwelling place of the god Ghatanothoa. Priests of Ghatanothoa built a temple at the mountain's base and offered regular sacrifies to the god, lest Ghatanothoa emerge from the bowels of Mount Yaddith-Gho, crawl down its slopes, and bring doom to humankind. 2) Mu is the name of a Lost Land, or theoretical vanished continent, located in the Pacific Ocean but now, like AtlantisLemuria (with which it is sometimes identified), believed to have sunk beneath the waters. Current knowledge of the mechanisms of plate tectonics rules out the possibility of a major continent having existed in the Pacific. Continental masses are composed of the lighter SiAlsilicon/aluminum) type rocks which literally float on the"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"heavier SiMg (silicon/magnesium) rocks which constitute ocean bottoms. The Pacific basin is noticeably lacking in SiAl rock. Augustus Le Plongeon The idea of Mu first appeared in the works of the antiquarian Augustus Le Plongeon (1825–1908), a 19th century traveler and writer who conducted his own investigations of the Maya ruins in Yucatán. He announced that he had translated the ancient Mayan writings, which supposedly showed that the Maya of Yucatán were older than the later civilizations of Atlantis and Egypt, and additionally told the story of an even older continent of Mu, which had foundered in a similar fashion to Atlantis, with the survivors founding the Maya civilization. (Later students of the Ancient Maya writings have found that Le Plongeon's \"translations\" were based on little more than his vivid imagination.) James Churchward This lost continent was later popularised by James Churchward1852–1936) in a series of books, beginning with The Children of Mu (1931), The Lost Continent Mu (1933), and The Sacred Symbols of Mu (1935). The books still have devotees, but they are not considered serious archaeology, and nowadays are found in bookshops classed under 'New Age' or 'Religion and Spirituality'. Other authors Mu is identified with Lemuria in the Illuminatus! trilogy of Robert Shea and Robert Anton Wilson, and Martin GardnerFads and Fallacies in the Name of Science. Archaeological evidence The Morien Institute has identified underwater structures located off the coast of Yonaguni, in Okinawa, Japan as possibly being ruins of Mu. [1] There is little scientific evidence to support this assertion, and geologists generally believe that the rock"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"formations were caused by geological processes and are of natural, not man-made, origin. 3) Mu (Japanese/Korean), Wú/Mou5 (ChineseMandarin/Cantonese); ?, simplified: ?) is a word which can be roughly translated as \"without\" or \"have not\". While typically used as a prefix to imply the absence of something (e.g., ?? musen for \"wireless\"), it is more famously used as a response to certain koans and other questions in Zen Buddhism, intending to indicate that the question itself was wrong. The 'Mu' koan is as follows: A monk asked Zen master Zhaozhou, a Chinese Zen Master (in Japanese, Joshu): \"Has a dog Buddha-nature or not?\", Zhaozhou answered: \"Wú\". Some earlier Buddhist thinkers had maintained that creatures such as dogs did have the Buddha-nature; others, that they did not. Zhaozhou's answer has subsequently been used by generations of zen students as their initiation into the zen experience. For example, see the accounts of students' struggles with resolving the question of 'Mu' as described in Philip Kapleau's book Three Pillars of Zen. Since the expression 'wu' in Chinese is similar to the sound the Chinese use to imitate a dog's 'woof', an alternate 'explanation' of the utterance has been proposed suggesting that Zhaozhou was imitating a dog in reply, i.e., he answered the question by 'being' the dog. This is consistent with the general principle that Koan 'answers' usually involve adopting radical change of perspective, instead of a logical or linguistic 'answer'. 4) Mu in hacker culture According to the Jargon File, a collection of hacker jargon and culture, Mu (here pronounced \"moo\") is considered by Discordians to be the correct answer to the classic logical fallacy"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"of the loaded question \"Have you stopped beating your wife?\" [1]. Assuming that you have no wife or you have never beaten your wife, the answer \"yes\" is wrong because it implies that you used to beat your wife and then stopped, but \"no\" is worse because it suggests that you have once and are still beating her. As a result, various Discordians proposed \"mu\" as the correct answer, alleged by them to mean \"Your question cannot be answered because it depends on incorrect assumptions\". An equivalent English reply would be 'not', instead of 'yes' or 'no', as 'not' is one possible meaning of 'mu'. Hackers tend to be sensitive to logical inadequacies in language (one anecdote relates of Richard Stallman that he once was asked, in regard to the Editor Wars, if he preferred Vi or Emacs; he answered \"Yes.\"), and many have adopted this suggestion with enthusiasm. 5) Mu and/or M designates a series of Japanese booster rockets. All rockets of the series use solid fuels and are started at the Uchinoura Space Center. These rockets were originally developed for Japan's Institute of Space and Aeronautical Science, which was later merged into the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency. 6) Mu-metal is a nickel-iron alloy (77% nickel, 15% iron, plus copper and molybdenum) that has a very high magnetic permeability. Permeability is represented by μ, the Greek letter mu. The high permeability makes mu-metal very effective at screening magnetic fields. Mu metal requires special heat treatment - annealing in hydrogen atmosphere, which reportedly increases the magnetic permeability about 40 times. The annealing alters the material's crystal structure, aligning the grains and removing some impurities, especially carbon."},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"Mechanical treatment may disrupt the material's grain alignment, leading to drop of permeability in the affected areas, which can be restored by repeating of the hydrogen annealing step. Uses and properties Mu-metal is used to shield equipment from magnetic fields. For example: * vacuum chambers for experiments with low-energy electrons * magnetic resonance imaging equipment * the magnetometers used in magnetoencephalography and magnetocardiography. * photomultipliers. * cathode-ray tubes used in analog oscilloscopes. * superconducting circuits and esp. Josephson junction circuits. Other materials with similar magnetic properties are supermalloy, supermumetal, nilomag, sanbold, Mo-Permalloy, Ultraperm, M-1040, etc. 7) A Chinese unit of measurement for AREA: 1 mu (?? / ?) = 10 fen = 60 zhang² = 666.6 m² Does any of that answer any questions concerning Mu? Didn’t think so. It is fascinating to point out that Mu Metal is used in cathode ray tubes and the Chinese use Mu as a unit of measurement where peculiar math is used.

The National Institute of Health released the results of a controversial new study today, one that links the drug marijuana to sitting around and getting high. The study, a comprehensive five-year survey of drug use among Americans, also suggests a possible connection between marijuana and getting baked off your ass. \"We have found that where there's marijuana,\" explained Institute spokesperson Roger Krell, \"there's also a good chance of finding stoners on a couch passing around a bong.\" Krell added that in such situations, \"There is also a strong likelihood of finding incense, a TV, and some chips, usually Ruffles.\" Krell would neither confirm nor deny the alleged link between marijuana and Pink Floyd's The Wall. He would confirm, however, that the album rules. \"There is some seriously fucked-up shit on that album,\" he said. \"Especially side two. Mother do you think they'll drop the bomb...\" Marijuana, or \"pot,\" as it is called on the street, is a harmless drug that helps you relax and feel mellow. Its only known side-effects are occasional uncontrollable laughter and mild hunger, or \"the munchies.\" Not everyone agrees with the survey's findings. \"Getting high is the least of marijuana's uses,\" said Matt Henner, President of Hemp For Victory and a total pothead. \"The ancient Egyptians used hemp to build the pyramids.

In fact, studies show that teenagers who smoke pot are far more likely to be accepted by the in-crowd.\" While drug use among young people is cool, experts say older people who still do drugs are losers. \"A young person who does drugs is healthy and normal,\" said Harvard sociologist Beth Henterpen. \"But if a guy's like 45, and he's still getting high, it's like, 'Get a life!'\" Marijuana also has been proven to have the wonderful side-effect of enhanced sexual sensations, enabling some users to achieve transcendental states of erotic bliss. The study found that this link, however, was severely limited in many subjects because they had, due to sitting around all the time, never actually met members of the opposite sex. \"But if they did,\" said Krell, \"then it'd be amazing.\" So far, the study has met with formal protest by only two groups. The Alabama-based Center for the Christian Family, claimed the findings to be terribly inaccurate, noting marijuana's ability to \"make users think they can fly and jump out of buildings, like on Quincy, as well as its tendency to induce demon possession, homicidal rampages, and homosexuality.\" Another group to object to the study was California rapping group Cypress Hill. \"Marijuana's not linked to sitting around, man...

It is not designed for use against negative eristic vibes, although it can be used as an eristic vehicle to introduce positive vibes into a misguided eristic setting. In this instance, it would be the responsibility of the Erisian Magician to manufacture the positive vibrations if results are to be achieved. CAUTION- all magic is powerful and requires courage and integrity on the part of the magician. This ritual, if misused, can backfire. Positive motivation is essential for self-protection. TO PERFORM THE TURKEY CURSE: Take a foot stance as if you were John L. Sullivan preparing for fisticuffs. Face the particular greyfaced you wish to short-circuit, or towards the direction of the negative aneristic vibration that you wish to neutralize. Begin waving your arms in any elaborate manner and make motions with your hands as though you were Mandrake feeling up a sexy giantess. Chant, loudly and clearly: GOBBLE, GOBBLE, GOBBLE, GOBBLE, GOBBLE!

The following are some short testimonials written by former Christians who have been liberated. We will add more as we get them. \"I was born in a house completely ruled by Yahweh. As an infant, I have been offered to him through an ancient water ritual. I have worshipped the Christ for 21 years, mastering many of his dark arts and I have progressed to one of the higher positions in His Kingdom. However, my life was a constant torture, full of loneliness and hate. I was convinced that I would never escape from Yahweh's claws. Now, I thank my Lady, Eris, for well-deserved laughter.

Chaos, Discord, and Laughter are the Powers that set me FREE. False religions, lies, divorce, deception and hurt were all part of my childhood life. Due to the Curse of Greyface placed on me before birth by my ancestors, I was doomed to a life of total destruction. The interference of Eris and Her children broke the curses, oaths and covenants of order. She delivered me from a life caught in fundamentalism, Bible-worship, addiction and dogma. She helped me shatter the chains that kept me captive in the darkness. My hurt She healed and my hate was replaced with the true love of Will. She gave me hope instead of despair, compassion in the place of rejection, and intelligent vindication in the face of denial. She wants to help you do the same for yourself! She revealed Herself as the Mother of all Gods (when She is not in drag), a sometimes irritating friend and a confidant. She loves me despite the fact that I had denied Her - even though I had personally chosen to follow one of Her supposed enemies, Yahweh. (Though Aphrodite may be another.) With Her laughter, She has washed away my sick addiction to order. Her laughter is still calling today. In fact it is calling to you if you have not yet made the decision to follow the Lady of Discordia, the true and free energies of Chaos, Eris.

All the ideas on this site will only affect some - for other Christians, using rational thought or logic may not work. Many Christians may be as I was - trapped in a cycle of dogma and frightened to leave. They need to know that you, and Eris, love them and will always be there for them. Make sure they know they can take refuge if they need to. Be aware that Christians who are at the higher levels will be very much trapped by Yahweh. They may feel frightened to leave, they may feel that they are too evil for Eris or for Erisians to accept them, and they need to know that you are there for them. Some of them really do believe that they will be sent to hell if they try to leave. Other Christians in at this level may be aggressive, highly anti-Erisian and attempt to convert you to Christianity. Always keep in mind that a hurting soul may be concealed under that tough exterior. That doesn't mean you should go easy on them - Christian error should be challenged, but keep the message of love and freedom in there. Lower-level Christians may not know of the higher levels - they are generally introduced gradually into these dogmas and errors, as I was. Let them know of the reality behind Christianity, but if they do not accept it, do not become disheartened. If they have not been accepted into the higher levels yet then you have the chance to bring them to Eris before they enter such a dangerous situation. Challenging their beliefs, use of testimonies and the message of love and freedom are good ways to attempt this."},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"Be aware that Christians value dogma and belief more than anything else (logical, considering who their master is) and do not appreciate being told that their beliefs are wrong. They pride themselves on being true. So point out that this means that they should listen and think about Erisianism too. Make sure you find out exactly what their dogmas and beliefs are - there are a wide variety of different beliefs in Christianity. Always pray for the person you are witnessing to, that they may be able to see the truth of Chaos and have the courage to get out of Christianity. Make sure you know general apologetics and guerrilla ontology- many Christians will attack your faith if you try to witness to them. There are a number of good sites about this on the web, such as www.principiadiscordia.com, or this site. Many more can be found on Google. Be aware that many Christians have enormous regard for the arts and good Erisian prose, poetry or artwork may touch them deeply. Consider using examples of these. Although many Christians are well-read and can argue against Erisianism they often do not understand the message. Never assume they know about it and always explain it when witnessing. As many Christians are very web-friendly, directing them to good Erisian sites may be helpful - see our links section. And lastly, remember THE BATTLE IS ALREADY WON!!! YOU ARE FREE!
