This magickal process mustinevitably be accompanied by some pain, doubt and disillusionment. We have endured(but so far SURVIVED!) years of conditioning and repression and to break free fromthis protective but limiting shell is an act of courage and perhaps for some of us, an actof desperation.Modern life, as lived by most of us, seems to conspire against our being 'awake'. Therobotic self, originally evolved as a necessary/defensive element of humanconsciousness, has now become almost too efficient, assuming more and moreauthority and allowing us to sleep far more than is 'good' for us, for instance, to drive acar adequaely whilst engaged in conversation. Difficulties arise when the robot beginsto operate where/when it is not necessary/appropriate, undermining free will andnarrowing our choice of alternative attitudes/decisions/actions. It is time we awake to our own ignorance. By injecting energy into our perceptionsand learning to assimilate the increased feedback we may confidently expect from suchan act of positivity/commitment, we are able to penetrate more deeply/participate morefully in/to living situations.To always rule, rather than to be ruled by, the robot, to constantly maintain one's highlevel or attentiveness, is virtually impossible. One split-second of inattention and wemay find ourselves floundering once more in habitual/pre-programmed modes ofattitude/communication/action. It can prove enormously difficult throughout even onelengthy conversation to never slip into some half-hearted agreement or skate overirksome/uninteresting points until some new/random phrase re-kindles our flaggingconcentration. When reading books we often selectively skip passages or even wholechapters when the contents fail to stimulate us sufficiently (or fail to confirm ourprejudices/mental fore-closures).These tendencies, though minor in their manifestation, are symptomatic of ourincredible reluctance to really PAY ATTENTION - to information around us, to otherpeople, even to ourselves (what our bodies, minds or feelings are trying to tell us) andyet a high level of inner attention is essential for the great magickal work, whether youcall the goal of that work enlightenment, liberation or inner growth.It seems that to achieve this necessary high level of awareness (= balance = beingcentered) one must have a motive (sincere desire for wisdom/power/freedom),something at stake (sanity/self-esteem/emotional independence) or simply a passionfor/an obsession with the unfolding of the self/self-programming/magickal experiencesetc. As one enlightened master once remarked, \"By passion is the world bound, bypassion it may be released.\" Motive however is not enought - one also needs methods,practical techniques for changing, sharpening and directing awareness. These"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"practiques lead one through various experiences/conclusions to a deeperunderstanding, a freer creativity and an emotional and mental liberation.The journey though is not an easy one - many great seekers/warriors/magickians havesuffered both mental and physical turmoil as a consequence of their spiritual/sorcerousexperimentations - Gopi Sharma, one of the leading exponents of Kundalini Yoga,underwent years of anguish and torment, one of the Merlins, Merlin Wylte, lost andfinally regained his sanity. Not for nothing are shamans dubbed \"the wounded healers\"- many great \"travellers\" are/become deeply divided beings on the quest forenlightenment/emancipation/individuation.The quest however, is a glorious one - a path of doubt and faith, disillusionment andjoy, ensnarement and freedom, and can ultimately lead to the pinnacle of humanachievement - to discover and express the (more) real self/selves.Chaos magick, when not in the hands, hearts and pens of elitists or those who haveexchanged old ideologies and \"isms\" for a new, equally restrictive set of beliefs andpractices (and prejudices), is an eclectic, umbrella term for the sum and total of allmagickal endeavor, from so-called primitive shamanic practiques to the mostsophisticated hermetic or kabalic systems. It may include elements from wicca, tantra,oriental metaphysics, \"Crowleyanity\" and anything else that could conceivably proveuseful/relevant/beneficial.Chaos (perhaps in future it should be reffered to as Khaos or Kaos to distinguish itfrom the banal or dictionary use of the word) magick is not simply another system,another alternative to mainstream tradition, a new, provocotive flavour for jadedmagickal appetites. It is any technique that works, any world-view that proves helpful -it is the employment of any beneficial systems coupled with an awareness of thelimitations of that system and an urge to transcent such restrictions. It leads/shouldlead to the creation/evolution of a much more individual, personalised world-view/setof magickal practices. Chaos magick is non-political (unless practiced by politicians),non-sexist, non-ageist and non-racist (unless of course it is employed by those who stillharbour doubts or prejudices in these areas). Above all, it is non-missionary - it cannotbe, for there is no set system to sell, no mandatory beliefs to embrace or reject and nocompulsory practices or festivals to observe or scorn. Chaos magick is a constant stateof unfolding/flux/uncertainty. The character Paul in Frank Herbert's \"Dune\" concludesthat the path of certainty is also the path of stagnation or even death.

It is (temporarily) all things and the spaces between - itis/can be all things and yet it also possesses nothing-ness. It accretes material forms invarious stages of complexity. It is what it touches - all interactions and relationshipsare it's by-products. It is infinite and beyond the comprehension of thefinite/linear/filing cabinet mind.Further, it is non-spiritual, inhuman, eternal, limitless, the womb and grave of everyform and substance, every thought and dream, every law, both known and unknown.Some call this energy/force/state/essence the void and approach it with a highlysophisticated system of applied psychology. Some, clinging to a golden vision of here-after/there-before, call it dream-time. Some call it chaos and revere it joyfully withbizarre rites and practices.This force moves, manifests, grows, develops, unfolds, reacts, stagnates and dissolvesby chance, whim, coincidence, random selection, developing tendencies, cause-and-effect (reaction) and perhaps other laws/processes we have yet to find any suitablyludicrous name for.One should/can choose to seek to become more aware of this flow, then (usually)move with it or alternatively physically/mentally/emotionally accelerate, divert orinfluence the process and/or it's manifestations and effects within the bounds of aspecific chain of events/situations. Both these options are inaugurated/enhanced by theutilisation of meditation, imaginations, visualisation, sigilisation, rituals and thatinsatiable urge-to-pursue called will. The process/science of sensing and influencingthis energy-flow is known to most of us as magick.The new-aeon shaman/witch/seeker/warrior must choose as his/her field of action thepoint where the mind touches the rest of the universe, the collective unconscious - thisis where imagination is stretched to the limit (ie - laws or probability are ruptured,where anything becomes possible it is wooed or persuaded intensely enough). This iswhere your dreams, records, books and drugs take you occasionally - it is anunexplored or under-developed part of your totality.First however you must endure an undoing, a ruthless spring-cleaning of beliefs andattitudes - otherwise this virgin inner landscape could become merely a repository ofaccumulated junk and sleepily/foolishly accepted trivia rather than the site ofdevelopment, the hunting ground, the temple of your new world-view.NOTE - in the mythos/perspective/world-view of the I.O.T., the writings of Moorcocketc., chaos is balanced by an apparent other-half, its polar opposite, known as Order orLaw. This creates unnecessary tension and dichotomy. It seems much more expedient,not to say realistic, to assume that it is the workings and structurings of law/order thatare a wilful by-product/an aberration of chaos - there is no ultimate law of Law - onlythe eternal play of chance, however it may manifest."},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"A DENUNCIATION I grow wary/weary and increasingly intolerant of those organisations/movements (theI.O.T. and a few other notables excepted) that seek to codify and delineate everytiresome aspect of an increasingly over-blown and irrelevant world-view.Theosophic/Kabalistic/Monotheistic lore is/should be dead, further, is evil, is rigid, issexist, is status-ridden, is of a past we should have outgrown/disowned. It is time fornew god/esse/s/daemons - learn to call them - they will always answer.Most of the old god-forms are buried beneath a ton of superstition, dogma anddiseased comprehension. Only a few have been cleansed by gnosis and a freshperception/application of belief. Use them until you can outgrow them.Beware of any systems of borrowed belief - trust only in 'systems' or accumulations ofbelief that can be seen or felt to be advantageous. Judge a god/ess by what he/she/itcan do for you, physically, mentally, emotionally - if your god answers not the call inthe night then give your allegiance elsewhere. Trust practice - test theory.The void/collective unconscious cannot manifest in a vacuum - that is, it will tend toassume these forms already recognisable/usable by the perceiver and will be asuseful/powerful/knowledgeable ultimately as the subconscious urges/impulses of theperceiver him/herself. These forms (gods/angels/daemons) ie - all gods are a wish-fulfilment of their devotees - this is not to rob them of 'reality'. For anything you canimagine already is/is becoming... but just how strong is your patron? Will he/she/it(you) bring you money when you need it? Has he/she/it (you) ever let you down? Inother words, is your reciprocation with your god(s) of a sufficient percentage of yourtotality to effect the more mundane levels of your reality, your everyday life? Have youlearned to rupture reality/distort probability?To enlarge the area of your perception/effectiveness, to re-create your god(s), this isall you ow him/her/them - to worship, to \"approach constantly with many rites\", to flexyour psychic muscles, to strengthen magickal will - this is your fealty.For some seekers/warriors this process is not so easily/comfortably achieved withmany of the deities of the past six or seven millenia. (ie - if the great guardians of Tibetwere so powerful, how come the Chinese over-ran and eventually destroyed so manytemples? Why did the ancient gods of Egypt allow Roman dominance? Nearer home,why didn't Andrasta (long may she be remembered!) cover and blind the marchinglegions with her nightmare wings and allow/assist our greatest queen to sweep to a justvictory?) Fate/whim/chaos is strongest - Jesus has to undergo his torment (this is mybeloved son in whom I am well-pleased?), Odin is doomed to die by Fenrir the wolf,Arthur's great accomplishment is the validity of the failed dream.) It is chaos/universewill that we should be revering/entering.Unless you already enjoy an intimate and untarnished symbiosis with an 'existing' deity,it is time for a new, flexible, personalised cosmology, my brothers and sisters!

The witch-doctor, the medicine man, the primitive sorceror ofthe hunt, all have much in common and would have little difficulty in relating to eachothers practices - and yet shamanism remains an intensely personal and relevant systemof application - each 'wise man' (or woman), through a result of his own culturalheritage, retains and enjoys a fresh inter-relationship with those spirits, ancestors,animal-allies and supernatural beings that probe beneficial to him and his work - allprogress is made through a fresh personal application of the inherited world-view. It isinteresting (and perhaps reassuring to some of you/us) to note that from eskimo toaborigine, in many cases the shaman is a misfit, sickly, reclusive and temperamental.note - being psychically awakened is not being 'spiritual' - manufactured notions ofgood or evil created by generations of guilt and fear/anxiety, both agents ofcastration/immobilisation, have no place in the world of the shaman.Power/effectiveness is all - a good shaman is a shaman that can get results. (Pure spiritor life-force, even thought 'manifesting' or being perceivable in human form as it oftendoes/is, is patently not human and need not therefore partake of human concepts suchas compassion, charity etc.) It seems to me that man/woman will become whateverthey really want/will to bo, despite (or perhaps because of) his/her professedreligion/code of living. Buddhism, one of the more tolerant of systems, was capable inTibet of great intellectual fascism, resulting in poverty and oppression for a greatpercentage of the populace. Christianity's charity and compassion is balanced by it'sarrogance and hypocrisy. Nowhere does it seem that a religion/system has totallysubdued or overcome mankind's 'worse' instincts. Everyone I speak to claims that theirparticular path has made them a \"better\" person. The world should therefore be a muchmore sane, hopeful place than it is.Initiation into the practiques of shamanism are usually preceded/inaugurated by seriousillness, feverish dreams/visions, a death-experience or by a personal, usually harrowingtrial by isolation and psychic siege, resulting in a life-long symbiosis with alternativeplanes of reality/mobility.The shaman uses few props in his or her work (healing, locating food or lost objects,divining or scrying) - a rattle, some coloured sand, a drum or flute, some healing orhallucinogenic herbs - relying instead on his/her own inherent or developed talents.Some rituals are of course employed - at times of great need or forceremonial/celebratory purposes.The line of initiation, where it exists, many shamans being called/evolved throughpersonal crisis and subsequent inner changes of perception, is similar to a guru-chelarelationship ie- the 'teachings' are passed from individual to individual and does nottherefore lend itself too easily to institutionalisation and mass propagation. Thoughsome teachings (usually myths or creation) are always transmitted, shamanism is"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"essentially an ever-changing, on-going process, as rigid, as flexible, as simple or ascomplex as its practitioner(s).It is a mistake to assume/deduce, as so many occultists (and shamans!) do, that wehave somehow fallen from grace in that we are not so attuned to the environment, notso psychically 'sharp' as our ancestors, and that this is inevitable. The abilities are stillwithin us, merely(?)/albeit submerged beneath centuries of technological developmentand a massive over-load of information input. The power can wither/atrophy, as indeedit has for the vast majority of humankind, but can be rediscovered/re-employed by thestrong and determined.

This has crystalised around my perception ofthe flowings/manifestations of the void/universe whim, and the face/form mysubconscious mind has affixed/attributed to the source of these flowings. In otherwords I have some how created/discovered/cognized my own god (or rather, the headof my personalised pantheon).This being, which I obviously/expediently regard as omnipotent, variously manifests asa wise old man, sometimes oriental in feature, sometimes more european/celtic, awizened, almost mummified-looking black-skinned kali-type hag or a strong andbeautiful maid marian archetype (both perhaps representations of my anima), ademonic half-bestial face semi-obscured by rainbow-splintered blackness, a futuristic-feeling 'crystal-master', a very Tibetan-looking Baphomet (a bi-sexual Yamantaka!), ajester, or as aspects of more familliar deities such as Herne, Diana or Anubis. 'His' mostconstant and notable (though by no means inevitable) feature throughout theseexpressions/representations is a pair of clear green eyes, piercing, cool and totallyinhuman.I have tested this force for power/effectiveness over other 'supernatural'entities/energies and also for some kind of moral integrity - a laughable and perhapshypocritical stance/action I am forced to agree, but no-one wants to become theplaything of a deceiving/malignant wizard/demon/manitou do they? I have asked foroccult wisdom, money, for advice, assistance in enterprises and of course forprotection more than once - and I have found/detected an unsettling aloofness, tracesof sardonic humour, a certain impatience, and yet a tenderness where/when leastexpected - all no doubt facets of my own persona - perception is intentional (evenunknowingly) and therefore subject to sense/character distortions.This entity has been known to me by various names and titles that have changed as myawareness and utilisation has evolved/improved. I now know 'Him' (the void-face mustultimately be sex-less or all sexes, gender being as arbitary a categorisation as race ofphysical size) as Ka'atas.I am joyful/creative/effective in the world of Ka'atas (pronounced ca as in cabin, ay asin sway, tas as in tassel - the accent being on the central syllable - Ka'atas) and yet Ihave achieved nothing you are not capable of, given time, facilities and motivation.

This is balanced to the lower right by the winged serpent (kundlini, if youwish) - the eternal now - the urge to enlightenment. The upward-pointing triangle(masculine) contains the horns of penetration, creation and destruction, illuminated bythe candle flame of spirit. Together they form a trident, an old symbol ofpsychic/spiritual fire. (note also the Hindu/Buddhist trisula and the nordic rune eolh-secg - eel-grass, that burns and cuts when grasped by the unwary.) The downward(feminine) triangle contains the three phases of the moon (the triple goddess) whichcombine mystically to create a solar eye, the gaze of flame.The pentacle is surmounted by a rune or sigil of infinity, an inverted alpha and omegacombined.

An increase of perception and comprehension necessitates that sooner orlater we must stand at the boundary of our conscious mind, ready to shift our identityfrom finite to infinite, from earth-consciousness to universe-consciousness - fromage/sex/class/race awareness to transcendent awareness (see A WILLING) - fromhuman identity to an alien vision. This threatens the ego, and our minds, as protectiveas ever, begin to throw up barriers, diversions, hindrances.These projections often take the form of eagles, vultures, hawks, hags, were-wolves,serpents, dragons or wrathful, fear-inspiring deities. To accept/identify with/transcendthese guardians/custodians of the subconscious mind's treasure is a primary task of thewarrior/wise (wo)man.The 'eagle' as defined in Castenada's book 'The Eagle's Gift' is of this nature andfunction - so are Baphomet and Abraxas, the compound god/goddess forms of thepsyche. (I met the eagle for the first time as a child whilst unconscious in the dentist'schair - it was to be a further 20 years before I understood the fearful experience ofbeing torn from the body and then 'twanging' back in agony time after time as the eagletoyed with me.)We revere and initially fear these entities for they are destroyers of the ego, stealers ofthe life-spark, the daemons that slam us, screaming helplessly, into yet another(premature) becoming.They are the Dwellers on the Threshold, the doorway to liberation and infinity - theymust be faced and overcome - better yet, we must learn that they are our key to anenlarged reality-model. To fear and worship them (ie - keep at a distance) is not nearlyenough - they must be invoked and employed time and time again. We must becomethem - then look beyond.Just as the ancient Greeks would have expected to encounter the frightening goat-godPan (from whom perhaps we derive the emotional term 'panic') in somelonely/inacessible forest or mountain landscape, so also must we be prepared to meetsuch guardians/threshold-keepers when we tread intentionally or by accident into themore remote or hitherto avoided areas of our mind, the shadowy realms of impulse,desire and fear. When we act upon or because of such instincts, we can neveraccurately predict the outcome of our deeds unless magickal intent is anintentional/integral part of the process.It is no use clinging to the human view-point - intelligence/ability to inter-act to mutualbenefit with environments (physical and otherwise) exists everywhere - the humanperception is but one note on an infinitely large keyboard.

In face, attitudes and actions thatare above/outside the normal limits of human probability and purpose, beyond ego-control/interference are probably more 'natural'/universe-whim-harmonised than ournormal, everyday postures, both mental and physical.Consider as many alternative stances as possible (believe in at least one improbabilitybefore breakfast!).Knowledge/absorbtion of the Threshold-Dwellers is the birth-rite of a cosmo-gnosticentity."},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"A WILLING The cultivation of the 'vajra' awarenessThe point where our conscious minds meet the sub/un-conscious, ie- the rest of theuniverse, is the field of action for the magickian.Two important aspects of the magickal will must be fully understood, and thatunderstanding then punched irrevocably into all future programmes. In other wordstwo seemingly opposite or polarised attitudes/stances/pre-requisites for the action,both vital to the magickian's survival/success, must become 'second nature'.These are two aspects/extractions of the drive towards 'eros' and 'thanatos' - life,possession, control, light, love, desire, focus and decay, disintegration, death,darkness, disorder.The first necessary (and much misunderstood) stance is the need to remain 'centred',self-aware, to retain one's 'spirit', to achieve self-possession (rather than possession ordisintegration through some external agency), to seek an uninterrupted stream ofconsciousness/awareness whatever may happen, be it calamity, death orrebirth/becomings. It is a channelling process/tendency, an identification of the self asseparate/disengaged from the rest of the universe.The second is the need to transcend the human view-point (see A FUNCTIONING),to realise the narrowness, arrogance and ultimate impotence of one's presentperception and to seek a re-alignment of one's will/vision to that of theuniverse/void/chaos flow. It is a diffusing process, an identification with somethinglarger than the human perspective (that can, unchecked or abused, lead to false bliss, anirbanic torpor, a capitulation of drive/energy).Held/practised together these two polar opposites create a third, highest stance. Asusual the tantrists have a word for it. The word 'vajra' or 'dorje' can either mean adiamond ie- that which is compact/focused, symmetrical/crystalised, unbreakable,immutable, untarnishable (part of the drive to eros/control, order, possession) or athunderbolt ie- that which is frightening, all-powerful, ego-destructive, disintegrating(part of the drive to thanatos/disorder, ego-death). 'Vajra' therefore may also be held tomean both stances (diamond-eros and thunderbolt-thanatos) together/simultaneously.This captures nicely the feel of the third stance so let us call it the vajra-awareness.As a bolt of lightning (the thunderbolt) strikes the earth, swift, random, brilliant(ILLUMINATING!), so too must the vajra-awareness be instantly in response,cultivated to be active/reactive to changing emotional states, rebirths, disasters andenvironments, being one with the lightning, being the lightning, flowing at one with allbut retaining the diamond-hard yet infinitely flexible self-ness in the midst ofconditions, manifestaions and becomings.

The Golden Dawn and other movements of that ilkbestowed upon the world great pioneers/warriors (and I here acknowledge my debtand gratitude to them) but one can no longer trudge drearily in their well-wornfootsteps, hoping that (by some process of sympathetic magic?) some of theiraccomplishments/abilities will rub off - if you pursue dinosaur tracks all you are likelyto acquire are dinosaur droppings and a few bones - small reward for a life-time'swork. A fossil is not a living creature - discovering someone else's reality and making ityour own may be convenient and gratificatory, but it is also second-rate.Taking one of the greatest pioneers of all as our example - Aleister Crowley - whyelect/select as your guide through the vistas of inner space a man who apparently couldonly liason with his guardian angel through long and over-irksome ritual and whosepatron entity could only communicate in cryptic and at times childish fashion? TheBook Of The Law is indeed a master-piece but an over-rated work for all that, intoday's consciousness-climate. It is significant that Aiwass, a herald of the new aeon,should encourage Crowley in the utilisation of ancient, traditional god-forms (Greek,Egyptian etc) - this is no doubt due to Aiwass's emenation from the third station of thetree of life - the sphere of Saturn (the Aquarian ruler). Learned/intuitive Kabalistswill/should realise the attributes/connotations/implications.There is little need to endure, for example, the absurdly tedious Abra-Melin ritual(s) torealise that one can surpass Crowley.It is also ludicrous that a garbled, distorted, accumulation of half-truths and childishinterpretations called The Holy Bible (a tome/tomb of 'Law' - the chronicles of a death-culture) should still carry any 'spiritual' authority. One of it's few useful/relevantpassages (from the Book Of Revelations) is a thinly-veiled warning against (and a fearof) opening the chakras and prematurely awaking the dormant, reptilian part of thebrain - a minor but potentially lethal chakra/nexus which can be sensed/energised by'flooding' the back of the neck where the spine meets the skull. It was precisely thisfear which caused Lovecraft to physically disown in later life his own claustrophobicvisions of great serpentine entities, inspired by the once myth-encrusted Necronomicon(now a relatively standard grimoire).I must confess however that it is sometimes mis-leading to judge a cosmology/systemby it's source. I have a friend who drew his initial impetus from Tolkien's 'Lord Of TheRings' - the resulting world-view and techniques of magic were far from 'elven' - hiswork is grim, revengeful, bloody - and effective."},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"A DELIVERINGA prayer to the god/ess of ChaosGOD/GODDESS, WHAT MUST I YET GIVE YOU!I BRING YOU MY FEAR, MY INSECURITIES, MY GUILT,MY CELEBRATIONSACCEPT ALSO MY PAST, FOR THIS TOO I NOW DISCARDTAKE IN YOUR DARK HANDS MY FUTUREAND TOGETHER WE SHALL RIDE THE TIDES OF CHAOSLAUGHING, CRYING, IN AN AGONY OF JOYA UNION GREAT AND FRUITFUL!I CAN NO LONGER TAKE REFUGE IN ILLUSIONCOMPLACENCY AND WISHFUL THINKINGI AM SCARRED WITH ERRORS AND IGNORANCEHEAL ME WITH MIRTH, MADNESS AND MYSTERY.O GREAT ONE!YOU ARE MY FRIEND THOUGH YOU SHOCK ME, DISTURB ME,AND SOMETIMES CAUSE ME PAINYOU ARE MY FRIEND BECAUSE YOU WILL NOT LET ME SLEEPTHE SLEEP OF LIESYOU COME TO ME IN MANY MASKS AND YET WHEN I SEEK TO SEETHEN I RECOGNISE MY FRIEND ONCE AGAINYOU PICK UP AND MAGNIFY MY EVERY MISTAKEYOU TAKE ME AT MY WORD AND ACT ACCORDINGLYYOU MOCK MY SURPRISE WHEN I REPEAT MY MISTAKESAND SUFFER YET ONE MORE TIMEYOUR SCOFF AT MY SELF-PITY AND TEASE MEUNTIL I ONCE MORE UNDERSTAND, ACCEPT AND ESCAPEYOU THROW DEATH AND MISERY IN MY FACES AS A BOUQUETTO SHOW YOUR LOVE, AWAKENING ME,GIVING ME THE JOY OF THE MOMENTAND THE MOTIVATION FOR MAGICKYOU BRING ME, UNEXPECTED, COMPASSION, ENCOURAGEMENT,THANKFULNESSYOU SURPRISE ME CONSTANTLYYOU BREAK ALL HABITS TO TEST MY AWARENESSYOU WALK IN MY SLEEP WITH FOOTSTEPS LIKE THUNDERYOU STIMULATE ME IN ENDLESS NEW BECOMINGSSOOTHING ME TOO, IN THE BALANCE AND INTEGRATION OF OPPOSITESYOUR PASSION, SO INTENSE, APPROACHES SERENITYYOUR CALMNESS IS INHUMAN, IMPLACABLE, UNSETTLINGYOUR TEACHING THE HARDEST I KNOWYOUR LESSONS THE SIMPLESTALL IS CHAOS-FLOW!THE VOID, THW WORKINGS OF THE UNIVERSE-WILLALL IS YOU, O GREAT ONE!"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"A MEDITATION (1) The Skeleton Meditation- for rest/rejuvenation and for dis-identity with the body - a useful preparation fordeath-experiences and astral travel. Sit cross-legged or kneel on a flat, comfortablesurface, eg- a carpeted floor, and take a few minutes to compose/quieten the mind.Begin to visualise/compose/quieten the mind. Begin to visualise/imagin your skin, fleshand muscle growing soft and flaccid, peeling from your skull and running like candle-wax down your body and onto the floor (with it goes any anxieties, problems,hindrances to relaxation etc). Continue this process, letting the flesh roll from yourneck, shoulders, arms and chest etc, until all that is left is a sitting or kneeling skeleton.Take your time and perform the exercise as intensely as you can.Now you can begin to reverse the process - imagine fresh, firm, healthy and vigorousnew flesh and skin growing/attaching itself to the bones. Work from the toes up,finishing the visualisation with a rested, rejuvenated, poised mind and body.Given the right (dramatic) circumstances ie- midnight in a dark room with eerie musicor sound-effects in the background or a forest/deserted house/scrap of wasteland attwilight, this can prove a most stimulating experience.Those of you who have performed the ancient Tibetan Chad (cuttingoff/dismemberment) ritual should take to this exercise like a duck to water.nb- the skeleton meditation can be used as a substitute for chakra-cleaning exercisesprior to a ritual."},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"A MEDITATION (2) The Tower Meditationnb- not to be confused with the tarot meditation(s) of the same name.This meditation is in essence a psychic/imaginary exploration of the chakras (it is notnecessary to accept the existence/relevance of chakras as anything other than aworking theory in order to gain benefit from this exercise). Each centre/nexus isvisualised as a room in a lonely and mysterious old tower, the rooms being connectedby a spiral staircase. Each room has it's own inhabitants (with whom you mayconverse), colour-scheme, atmosphere etc. The exercise may be performed as asequence of visualisations, one per day for a week, or each room/chakra can be visitedwhenever there is a need/desire/whim.The visualisation should always commence with an approach to the tower- this will setthe scene, prepare the imagination/aid receptivity.
