I left the occult “scene” in 1989 afterwhat has become known as the kaos-babalon working, after editing KAOS for fiveyears. Despite the intensity of the working, and the sense of triumph I felt and expressedin KAOS 13, I knew even then that I would be leaving, for in the wake of the workingI sensed but could not then quite express that despite this triumph I had ultimatelyfailed in the occult task set me, simply because no-one understood me, no-one wasready for what we had done, or few were, not enough at any rate. Or sometimes I evenfelt that I had been betrayed by the occult force that had led me... up the garden pathit seemed by a series of ever more seductive illusions. It appeared only a handful ofpeople really understood the complex matters I was dealing with, which, in turn, wereexpressed from various states of inspired demonic madness.A girl called “Amodali”—her magical and stage name—was Babalon, I was Chaos.Looking back over KAOS 13 recently it dawned on me that even though she was themuse for that issue I never actually wrote much about her. For the sake of documentingunderground occult history it occurs to me it is time to make good that omission.Amodali, who I lost touch with after kaos-babalon in 1989 and who is still known bythat name, is now “Mother Destruction” with her partner Patrick O’Kill (formerly ofthe band “Death in June”), a goth band working with the Norse Seidr, a seethingshamanic sexual trance gnosis. In early 1988 Amodali wrote to me in London fromAmsterdam, where she had picked up some issues of KAOS, and asked me to forward apackage to Nema in the US, prophetess of the Ma’at current. Her covering letter to mewas written on the back of a colour xerox of a photograph of herself naked, on all fours,her body hand-tinted emerald green, third eye headband, and a couple of strands ofblack hair against her white-powdered face. She later admitted that this photographwas intended as a spell to totally captivate me. It worked. She identified herself by thenumber 156, the number of both Babalon and Chaos by Hebrew gematria. I was"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"6beginning to doubt there were any women like Amodali out there, most of the womenI had encountered on the occult scene up until then were New Age airheads clutchingcrystals who backed off when they realised I was into the kind of occult practice thatthey labelled “black magic”.Amodali worked in peepshows in Amsterdam to fund her musical career. Specificallyher main venue was the “Walburga Abbey”, founded by Martin Lamers in 1976 andannexed to Anton LaVey’s Church of Satan. A little bit of history: Anton LaVey set upthe Church of Satan on Walpurgisnacht in 1966 in San Francisco. In 1972 Lamers flewfrom the Netherlands to San Francisco to meet with LaVey and returned with theCharter for the “Magistralis Grotto”, the first official European Church of Satan Grotto,which he set up in Etersheim in one of the oldest Protestant churches in the country. In1976 Lamers bought two back-to-back houses in the centre of the red-light district inAmsterdam, in one he established the Church of Satan and in the other the WalburgaAbbey where the clientele could watch the “sisters” perform “symbolic union with Satan”for “religious donations”, or, at least, that was what Lamers told the Royal NetherlandsCourt when he sought tax exemption status.Although the Walburga Abbey was essentially a Satanic sex club, Amodali regardedthe Church of Satan as her plaything and used it as a place to manifest Babalon. Shealso invoked Baphomet there every day. It had typical Church of Satan chic: luminousskeletons in the lobby, goat heads on the wall, that kind of crap. The reality of theWalburga Abbey was that she sat upon an altar naked, the poor unsuspecting punterwould come in off the street imagining he was going to get kinky sex. He entered thetemple lined with black velvet and saw Amodali on the altar, who instructed him to sitclose by and lay back with some money, fifty dollars or more, on his nose. She wouldthen sit on his face and pick up the money. This is how Amodali described to me in aletter what happens next:Then I freak ’em out with some appropriate Satanic textbook nonsense. Suitably awe-struck, they begin to take in their surroundings, the gaudily painted “glitter” magic circles,inverted pentagrams on the walls etc. Of course they want to fuck me, I’ve been offeredthousands, I just say “I only fuck with Satan, darling”. The place has nothing to do withsex, real sex, only Power. All the time I’ve spent there naked, proud, amongst the mostridiculous slime of humanity, my inner core of extreme purity has been tempered to anexquisite degree. Thousands have gazed upon my naked beauty. None have been worthyof direct knowledge of it. They give money for the honour of looking and touching.Then they’re commanded to crawl back to their holes. Thus can I support my magicaland musical career."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"7After corresponding for a while Amodali flew to London and we performed the kaos-babalon working—an intense magical experience that still does not yield to my powersof description—and initiated the 156 current, which I wrote about in somewhat frenzieddetail in KAOS 13 and here join with others to write about further in this current issue.So why the gap of over a decade?I was at the pinnacle of my occult explorations, yet something within me drew meaway from the occult scene completely. What had seemed like total success, thealchemist’s dream realised, turned sharply into what appeared to be complete failureand illusion, and the glory, all too brief glory of Babalon, dissolved like a lingeringmirage. I experienced it as the elixir of fulfilment and magical reality turning to ashes inmy mouth. I was, quite literally, on the edge of magical lunacy and I recognised thesigns in others who had gone before me—Jack Parsons declaring himself the Antichristafter his Babalon Working with Marjorie Cameron, for instance.Amodali went her way and I went mine. I gave up Goetic magick and dabbling withdemons, I gave up magick altogether, I threw my Crowley books in the bin and wandered,cutting myself off from my former accomplices in the occult, wishing to expunge mymagical activities from the world. For a time I turned to the whisky bottle and wrotecovertly about my profound sense of disappointment in Yip-i-addy-i-ay!, which I hand-set in lead and hand-printed and published in a limited edition of 75 copies at TheHerculaneum Press in November, 1989. (See Nash, Paul W. “Joel Biroco and TheHerculaneum Press”, pp 77–91, in the Summer 1998 issue of The Private Library, Journalof the Private Libraries Association.)I formally renounced magick with an oath to that effect, although, as I have foundout recently—much as a sigil will sometimes momentarily return from forgetfulness toalight upon consciousness in the realisation of its accomplishment—such a renunciationis essentially temporary and little more than a redefining of oneself for another purposeand once that purpose has been achieved that oath ends, indeed, never was, for arenunciation of magick is a magical act in itself.For the next few years I devoted myself to Zen, painting, and other writings, such asSlow Volcano (1993), a personal portrayal of Buddhist experience. I tied up a few looseends from KAOS in Kwatz! (1990) and Epoch (1991), but I avoided, largely unconsciouslyit seems to me now, serious reflection on the meaning of the 156 current. One night inJuly 1995 I took seven years worth of unpublished notes, prophecies, and automaticwritings associated with my previous life as an occultist, about 1000 pages, out into theback garden and burnt them, along with about 200 paintings, mostly of demons. (Inthe late 80s my rooms had my automatic drawings and paintings of demons stuck allover them, the kind of rooms that feature on TV news stories as evidence of insanity if"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"8you go out and commit some horrendous atrocity, the camera would have lingered on awooden skull with the seal of Astaroth on its crown, drawn in my own blood.)In August 1995 I left London for a solitary retreat on Rannoch Moor in the ScottishHighlands, which proved to be a turning point. I sat day after day not seeing a soul inthe thick mist meditating and listening to the curlews cry hidden in the low cloudscape(like a monk “behind cloud walls” as the poet Andrew Young once expressed it). Ibelieve I had some sort of epiphany there which cast my previous occult activities in theshade. In the next five years I left Crowley, Chaos, and Babalon far behind—though Ioccasionally took an interest in Taoist talismans as a subject for paintings and raised thedragon by ritual at the spring full moon, I no longer considered myself interested inmagick. So the last thing I expected was to find myself gravitating towards the WesternMagical Tradition once again, in early 2001.It slowly became apparent to me that I had not failed to manifest the kaos-babalon156 current in 1989 after all, but rather we had indeed initiated this dynamic changebut it had taken over a decade for the magical seed to emerge from its dormancy andstart to grow (the blink of an eye in cosmic terms). At first, when I became aware thatI was being sucked back into the world of the occult I had so forcefully slammed thedoor on, I was most apprehensive, not desirous of taking on “that unfinished business”again (as is apparent from my first response in the Correspondence section, “How theChaos current died”). But the nature of the mail I was receiving—particularly from anAmerican Enochian magician at the heart of “The Black Lodge of Santa Cruz” affairin the early 90s—made it seem worthwhile to once more put together an issue of KAOS.I am grateful also to Alan Moore for enthusiastically encouraging me in this endeavour,such that my resolve “never to return” weakened enough to get the ball rolling. Asbefore, KAOS is a blend of notes, reflections, passing fascinations, correspondence, essaysand, of course, satire on the theme of contemporary occultism. Some of it started off asdiscussions on the alt.magick newsgroup. For me, it seems to finally draw a line underthe work of the past, yet I realise that for others it may open up a door they have onlyjust become aware of.JOEL BIROCOLondonkaosbabalon @hotmail.com"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"9KAOS-BABALON 156 gematriaIt is worth pointing out exactly how the 156 correspondence is derived. I originallychanged chaos to kaos in 1987 as a result of channelled information rather than Hebrewgematria, although it is indeed corroborated by the change of the Hebrew letter Chethto Kaph. It is interesting to note the end of Crowley’s skrying of the 3rd Æthyr in TheVision and the Voice: “...chaos, that is the four-fold word that is equal to her seven-foldword”. In Hebrew Chaos rendered as a four-fold word is sw(k. Remembering thatHebrew is written right to left, k (Kaph) = 20, ( (Ayin) = 70, w (Vau) = 6, s (Samech) =60. Total 156. The seven-fold word is of course babalon.The origin of the spelling babalon (as opposed to the Biblical Babylon) is dealtwith in detail further on. In Hebrew babalon is }(l)b)b. This breaks down as follows:b (Beth) = 2, ) (Aleph) = 1, b = 2, ) = 1, l (Lamed) = 30, ( (Ayin) = 70, } (Nun) = 50.Total 156 (Nun final, though shown in the Hebrewtype, is not used in the gematria, but rather giventhe same value of 50 that it has when appearing inthe middle of a word, when Nun is written n). Notethat w (Vau) is used for “O” in Chaos (as it is inCrowley’s 333 spelling of Choronzon), but ( (Ayin)is used for “O” in Babalon, and that Ayin is usedfor “A” in Chaos but Aleph is used in Babalon.Aleister Crowley’s cult of Thelema, or 93current, emerged from The Book of the Law in 1904,Chapter I, verse 39 reading: “The word of the Lawis qelhma.” The “93 current” is so-called becausethe Greek word “thelema” (qelhma), meaning“will”, adds up to 93 by Greek gematria, as does“agape” (agaph), “love”, hence the Thelemic formula “love under will”. In the Thelemicedifice, 93 is also the gematrical summation of “Aiwaz”, an alternative spelling of“Aiwass”, the minister of Hoor-paar-kraat who proclaimed himself to be the transmitterof The Book of the Law. The 156 current, the occult formula of kaos-babalon, emergedout of Crowley’s skrying of the Enochian Æthyrs in Algeria in 1909, as recorded in TheVision and the Voice, and prior to this via the operations of John Dee and Edward Kelly.It is the contention of KAOS that the 93 current and the 156 current are not separatecurrents but points in a process. The 93 current is effectively dead now, with Thelemicorthodoxy clinging to its empty shell, 156 carries forward the reformulated current."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"10CorrespondenceHow the Chaos current diedJoel—In talking about the death of the Chaos current you said: “People like the iottied it all up in what I predicted and called ‘nostalgia magic’ in 1989. But potentialnever dies, and one day people may pick up the threads once again.”Come on bro, don’t just talk it, do it. Haven’t I irritated you enough yet? You killedit, now resurrect it!DAVID CANTUActually, Stephen Sennitt announced the death of the Chaos current first, in his editorialin NOX 6 (1988), entitled “Obituary for the Chaos current”, he wrote:Joel Biroco’s slant on Chaos magic has also been short-lived and by my experience ofhim, transcended—if that’s the word. We can see that this may have been planned, but Isuspect he played it by ear. Perhaps at this moment Mr Biroco is happily consideringhimself the catalyst that destroyed the empty posturing we have called the Chaos current.A nod to him on that one, but let me be the first to announce that the Chaos current isofficially dead!In KAOS 13 ( January, 1989) I said this was a premature ejaculation and I instigatedkaos-babalon or “156 current”, which I had been working on in the background as atruly “occult” (hidden) current, regarding Babalon as having occult identity with Chaos,essentially being female and male counterparts. It turned the Chaos current into ahard-edged and dark sex magick current.I was very excited by the kaos-babalon development and personally experienced atremendous amount of magical power associated with it. I regarded it as the “meaning”of everything me and Stephen and everyone else had been doing and where it had"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"11naturally been leading. I felt it would “save” the Chaos current. I still believe that the156 current is where it’s at. But it was pretty much ignored at the time, it was just a bittoo powerful for the iot and other chaos groups. Yet they have never even mentioned itas being part of the Chaos current and that to me is a disgraceful failure on their part,showing territorial ambitions rather than a dedication to the Great Work. They justcarried on doing the same old stupid stuff they had always been doing and are stilldoing. They have made no progress. It is moribund fiddling around. I suspect it willpretty much carry on like this, that’s why I regard it as a dead current. BUT, within thatdead current, that “nostalgia current”, is a doorway into kaos-babalon. But at the timeit was like we set off some kind of occult H-bomb and to be honest I still sense theshock waves from it. But it exploded what was. It sent me in a different direction. Itchanged a lot of things. There was a sense of disappointment, but that was only illusion,if powerful illusion. When I met up again with Stephen and Louise a year later I agreedwith him that he was right, the Chaos current was dead.I regard the 156 current as an essentially underground current of frontline occultismand the true successor to what was the 93 current of Thelema (now another nostalgiacurrent) and also the Chaos current, both outmoded by kaos-babalon yet foreshadowedin both. It was either an idea before its time, or something that is practised away fromthe crowd. Maybe people practice something like it and don’t yet realise it is the 156current and what its great significance is. Occult education seems generally quite poorthese days, people know very little about anything and lack even the most basic occultexperience. Though I guess that’s always been the same, only a few of the many whopass through the occult make real progress. But I laid down everything about kaos-babalon in KAOS 13. I didn’t kill the Chaos current, actually I saved it for the future.Now that work is not easily available and my inclination is to let sleeping dogs lie. I’mdoing other stuff now, although I guess something drew me here [alt.magick newsgroup]to tell you these things, to fill you in on “your chaos heritage”. Many “chaos magicians”think the origins of the current don’t matter and think being ahistorical is cool andiconoclastic, but it just means they are doomed to run on the spot, never swelling aprogress.Magick is about progress. As Ellic Howe once said to me when I asked him abouthis motivation for writing The Magicians of the Golden Dawn: “If you don’t know wheresomething has come from you know very little about it.” He was right.I still don’t think people are ready for kaos-babalon. It will probably be resurrectedby some occult historian in 20 years time (perhaps sooner) and then maybe some practicaloccultists will come across it and feel that shiver go up their spines, the dynamic tug ofa genuine current, and then it will spread like wildfire and initiate the true occult"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"12revolution I always intended (and still intend) that it should do. It is an occult deviceticking away awaiting its time. It will happen, I just don’t know when. It’s no longer, Idon’t think, for me to take forward, so don’t look to me (unless change induces the rolein me again and is more powerful than my resistance to taking on that mantle). Morelikely it’ll be some drugged-up kid who plays bass in a band and is sufficiently fucked-up to be inspired by what we created as the future of the Chaos current. And they’llreceive the transmission of it. No matter how much I “explain”, that is not the same asthe transmission of it, it’s an initiation. Good luck to him or her, and who knows I maybe around to kick him or her up the arse. I’ll spare you the old adage about “when thestudent is ready the teacher appears”. That’s the way it is, take it or leave it. So maybe Idid kill the Chaos current, but think of it as putting it out of its misery. But kaos-babalon, that’s a different matter.JOEL BIROCO93 is dead, long live 156!For me, and if I am understanding Joel correctly, when he states that 93 is dead, longlive 156, he is re-emphasizing something that I think Crowley suggests, but doesn’tstress for purely practical reasons (ie, he wanted the oto to succeed).Somewhere, and I don’t recall exactly where, Crowley states that the Beast and theScarlet Woman are to be considered as offices, meaning that they can at least theoreticallybe filled by any conveniently warm bodies. The confusion arises when we insist onattaching concrete entities to these theoretical concepts.For a Crowleyite (what is mistakenly termed a Thelemite), Aleister Crowley WASthe Beast. End of story, beginning of interminable argument. For the Caliphate, AleisterCrowley, as 10th degree oto, WAS the Beast, and his successor IS the Beast at thislatter date (too simplistic I know, but it will have to do for here). End of story, beginningof interminable law suits.For my admittedly hypothetical Joel Biroco, the Beast (approximating to chaos), isanyone assuming that office, should they be so bold. He is deliberately and explicitlyemphasizing the injection of a random element: that who gets to be the Beast is in noway determined by their acceptance by temporal power structures, or indeed, perhaps,by any predictable process. Beginning, not ending, of story.This is meant in no way to mean, “Oh, yeah, that’s been done, dude. Aleister said"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"13that. He said it all.” For me, ideas, concepts, images, currents, all these things and more,if they are true (in the sense of existing in some form above and below the Abyss), havea certain timeless quality. And the nature of timeless things is that terms like new andold are irrelevant to the things themselves. 156 is a new current: it does indeed runcontrary to the 93 current as temporally expressed in 1989.I don’t doubt that it was new to Joel back then, and it was new to me when he firststated it in this forum. And, 156 is the same old current: it is expressed in multipleplaces in multiple ways in the stuff that Crowley and doubtless others have transmittedto us.I have here a quote from Liber XV I found last night: “I believe in one secret andineffable lord; and in one Star in the company of Stars of whose fire we are created,and to which we shall return; and in one Father of Life, Mystery of Mystery, in Hisname chaos , the sole viceregent of the Sun upon the Earth; and in one Air the nourisherof all that breathes. And I believe in one Earth, the Mother of us all, and in one Wombwherein all men are begotten, and wherein they shall rest, Mystery of Mystery, in Hername babalon.”No explanation. A little orthodoxy seemed somehow appropriate.SATYR[Ed’s note—Kenneth Grant says in a footnote on the name chaos in the above quotationfrom the Gnostic Mass: “In Crowley’s copy of Magick, this name is replaced by that ofaiwass, Crowley’s Holy Guardian Angel, but is here used in a cosmic sense, the vehicleor medium of the Solar-phallic current.” In the above correspondence Satyr says thatthe beast “approximates to” chaos, but as I understand it, and pointed out in KAOS 13on p 12, chaos is a secret name of the beast, something I believe was originally statedby Kenneth Grant. On p 21 of Aleister Crowley and the Hidden God (London: FrederickMuller, 1973) Grant writes concerning the number 156:It is also, according to Liber 418, the number of Chaos, which is a concept of singularimportance in the qabalah of Thelema for it is a secret name of The Beast. Babalon isthus identified with her true Lord.Crowley describes Babalon as the bride of Chaos in Liber Cheth (Liber 156), Verse 1:This is the secret of the Holy Graal, that is the sacred vessel of our Lady the ScarletWoman, Babalon the Mother of Abominations, the bride of Chaos, that rideth upon ourLord the Beast."},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"14See also The Book of Lies (Liber 333, first published 1913), Chapter 11, “The Glow-worm”, where Crowley writes of “a seeming duality of Chaos and Babalon” andcomments “Chaos and Babalon are Chokmah and Binah, but they are really one”.Chapter 49, “Waratah-blossoms”, takes Babalon as its subject. The waratah is a“voluptuous scarlet flower” common in Australia, hence its use for a chapter about theScarlet Woman, which parallels the Book of Revelation in its repeated use of the numberseven. Revelation 17 contains the famous Biblical depiction of the Great Whore:And I saw a woman sit upon a scarlet coloured beast, full of names of blasphemy, havingseven heads and ten horns. And the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet colour, anddecked with gold and precious stones and pearls, having a golden cup in her hand full ofabominations and filthiness of her fornications. And upon her forehead was a namewritten, mystery, babylon the great, the mother of harlots and abominationsof the earth.Although precisely which beast of those mentioned in Revelation “Babylon” rides isambiguous—see the essay “The seven-headed dragon and the demon Choronzon”later—in Revelation 13:18 it is written: “Here is wisdom. Let him that hathunderstanding count the number of the beast: for it is the number of a man; and hisnumber is Six hundred threescore and six.” Crowley exactly parodies this verse with hissimilar statement at the end of Chapter 49 of The Book of Lies: “Here is Wisdom. LetHim that hath Understanding count the Number of Our Lady; for it is the Number ofa Woman; and Her Number is An Hundred and Fifty and Six.” In his commentaryCrowley notes: “...the author frankly identifies himself with the beast referred to inthe book, and in the Apocalypse, and in Liber Legis.” One of the fundamental insightsof the 156 current is that Chaos is the Beast, and not Crowley himself. Crowley certainlyhints as much in his writings, but the importance of this distinction appears to havebeen lost on Crowleyites, hence the subsumation of the 93 current by the 156 current.Chapter 49 also reproduces the seven-pointed star sigil of babalon, which is theofficial seal of the A∴A∴ (Argenteum Astrum, “The Order of the Silver Star”,supposedly Sirius). This seven-pointed star appears to have been modelled on the Sigilof Æmeth received by John Dee and Edward Kelly, a design of heptagons andheptagrams, plus a pentagram, which in itself appears to have been based on a similarfigure found in Liber Juratus, more commonly known as The Sworne Booke of Honorius.In Chapter 56 of Lies, “Trouble with Twins”, Crowley writes “Holy, holy, holy, untoOne Hundred and Fifty Six times holy be our lady that rideth upon the beast!” andcomments “156 is babalon”. See also “The Star Ruby” and “Starlight”."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"15In a note on the 12th Æthyr in The Vision and the Voice (Liber 418) Crowley remarks:“The formula of 156 is constant copulation or samadhi on Everything.” The referencesto Chaos and Babalon in this work are particularly important in that they representCrowley’s first contact with the True Current in 1909 via the Enochian Æthyrs, afterwhat is looking increasingly like a false start with the reception of Liber AL in 1904.]The “Babalon” spelling, Enochian, and bondage[Ed’s note—In KAOS 13, p 23, I stated that the Babalon spelling of Babylon derivedfrom Crowley’s Liber AL vel Legis (The Book of the Law), but on re-reading Liber ALyears later I was surprised to find that the word Babalon doesn’t occur in that work atall, just “Scarlet Woman” and “Scarlet Concubine”, and I am uncertain where I got theidea. I suspect I picked it up from an error of Kenneth Grant’s, on re-reading his AleisterCrowley and the Hidden God recently I noticed in his glossary he writes: “Babalon: Thecurious orthography stems from The Book of the Law...” (p 205). He also makes thiserror in The Magical Revival. Crowley in the commentary on Chapter 49 in The Book ofLies notes that Babalon “is the name referred to in Liber Legis, I, 22”—which reads: “Iam known to ye by my name Nuit, and to him by a secret name which I will give himwhen at last he knoweth me.” In correspondence with Satyr I asked him whether heknew where the first occurrence of the Babalon spelling occurred, my own suspicion offthe top of my head being Liber Cheth. My enquiry prompted Satyr to do a bit of diggingand he came up with a surprising find placing the original first usage of the “Babalon”spelling way before Crowley in the Enochian Keys transmitted to Dr John Dee andEdward Kelly. The first use by Crowley, however, is in The Vision and the Voice, whichformed much of the original spark of inspiration that led to the kaos-babalon working.Satyr also went further into his interest in Enochian in response to my request for hisreading recommendations. And, for spice, a little on knot magick and bondage relatedto the 156 current.]Hi Joel—Glad you brought up the topic of Babalon, as I just found something interestingin my Journal on “156”:3 FEB III–19 [1990]—1033.

Liber Cheth is a damned good guess, and would have been mine as well.And you’re real close too, but it was preceded in print by “Liber XXX Ærum vel Sæculisub figura CCCCXVIII: Being of the Angels of the 30 Æthyrs: The Vision and theVoice” published in The Equinox: Vol. I, No. V (March, 1911). Liber Cheth appeared inNo. V I (September, 1911).Crowley was told the correct spelling of Babylon by an angel in the 12th Æthyr,where he also had the vision of the Holy Graal. This was received 4–5 December, 1909,11:30 pm to 1:20 am, at Bou-Saada, Algeria. I looked in Regardie’s edition, The Visionand the Voice, and found in a footnote to p 149:14. Bab = gate. Al = God. On = ON. O=70. N=50. ON = 120. Note that Her Name doesnot appear properly spelt until the 10th Æthyr is done. The Seer had no idea how to spellthe name till he was told by the Angel.He apparently meant “done” quite literally. He wrote Her name in the sand with hisHoly Ring at the conclusion of the “Vision” of the 10th, on December the 6th. Accordingto Regardie, the source of the note was from notes Crowley scribbled in two of hiscopies of Equinox 5, most probably during the Cefalu period. It is possible, I suppose,that the correct spelling was printed by Crowley prior to March 1911, since it’s used onthe Seal of the A∴A∴, but I have no evidence of it before me. I’m glad you asked aboutthis. Its first occurrence hadn’t registered in my mind, until I started digging.The first instance of the spelling “babalon” occurs in the Enochian Keys, or Calls,transmitted to Dee and Kelly. There, the word babálon is translated as “wicked” (“...atorment to the wicked and a garland to the righteous...”: 6th Key, English translation).They received the 6th Key on Saturday, 14 May 1584, in Cracow. This may be found inCasaubon’s A True and Faithful Relation of what passed for many Yeers Between Dr JohnDee and Some Spirits, p 122. It’s in one of Dee’s magical diaries, entitled “Libri MysticiApertorii Cracoviensis Sabbatici, An. 1584”, a manuscript of which occurs in CottonAppendix XLVI (sometimes called Royal Appendix XLVI, or Sloane ms. 5007).Curiously, it seems that Crowley must have known about this spelling from the Key,but did not appear to make the connection, despite the fact that he received the Keysfrom the Golden Dawn (RR et AC, through Cecil Jones, presumably [Ordo Rosæ Rubeæet Aureæ Crucis, or “Order of the Red Rose and Golden Cross”, the Inner Order of theGolden Dawn—Ed]). In his own version of the 6th Key, published as “A Brief Abstractof the Symbolic Representation of the Universe Derived By Doctor John Dee Throughthe Skrying of Sir Edward Kelly Part II: The Forty-Eight Calls”, in The Equinox: Vol.I, No. VIII (September, 1912), he gives the spelling as “babalonu”. I rather doubt that"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"17this represents deliberate obfuscation on his part, as the Golden Dawn used this funkyschema whereby all “n”s were pronounced as “nu”.You ask, “What books would you recommend on Enochian stuff?”. I told a friendjust last night that if you read all the extant source material, and all the books that havebeen written about the material and related issues, making careful notes of cross referencewith an eye to determining points of correspondence, and noting the differences, overthe course of a year or so you might come up with a fairly decent understanding of thesystem.But I’m pretty certain that’s not the answer you want, since in your situation it’smore smart-assed (though honest), than helpful.My first introduction to the material was through Israel Regardie’s The Golden Dawn,though it’s certainly not the best place to start. My first working text was The EnochianEvocation of Dr John Dee (Edited and translated by Geoffrey James. Gillette, New Jersey:Heptangle Books, 1984), which I am told is still in print in paperback under the titleThe Enochian Magick of Dr John Dee: The Most Powerful System of Magick in Its OriginalUnexpurgated Form. This is a really good text, constituting an attempt to assemble thematerial into the form of a grimoire.In 1989, a new book appeared: Elizabethan Magic: The Art and the Magus (RobertTurner. Longmead, Shaftesbury, Dorset: Element Books, 1989). This is an excellenttext, giving a good introduction to both the material and its historical setting. David[ Jones] and I worked from it extensively in 1990.Much as I love these two references, they still fail to give the full picture as I havecome to understand it. I could answer your question a little better, tailoring my responseto your needs, if you could tell me what aspect of the system you wish to investigate(historical, theoretical, mechanical, consequences and influence, or what have you). Ilike the work of Dame Frances A Yates for historical context (The RosicrucianEnlightenment and The Occult Philosophy in the Elizabethan Age, are the most relevant).She was a “real” historian, and the first to rehabilitate Dee, and show the profoundimpact he had on the course of European thought.So, assuming for the moment that you don’t know which direction you’d like to go,I’ll give you what I think might be relevant.Crowley’s synopsis is given in two parts, in two numbers of Vol. I of The Equinox,both available online at:http://www.the-equinox.org/vol1/no7/eqi07021.html [Part I]http://www.the-equinox.org/vol1/no8/eqi08012.html [Part II]This is as good a place to start as any, and obviously forms the framework for thework Jones was doing, and to which I myself made some small contribution. This online"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"18version has the graphics in ascii format, and as such, they stink. The next “must read”text (and I’m sure you already have), is Liber 418 or The Vision and the Voice, or whatevertitle it sometimes assumes. It also is available online at:http://www.the-equinox.org/vol1/no5/eqi05016.htmlI can’t stress enough the importance of this document. For me, The Book of the Lawpales in comparison, and, more to our point, it is the “source” from which both “Chaos”and “Babalon” (as he understood them) spring. I direct your attention, in particular, toÆthyrs 12 and 4, and refrain from quoting them here in the hope that you will readthem yourself. The 4th, I think, has the essence of the answer you seek concerningchaos being a secret name of the Beast. At the conclusion of 418, Crowley gives a briefoutline of the nature of the Visions, and in that of the 24th he notes: “...the ScarletWoman, who by men is thought of as Babalon as he is thought of as Chaos.” With alldue respect, what Grant may or may not have said is immaterial to the question [Ed’snote—Satyr refers to Grant mentioning that Crowley replaced the name chaos withaiwass in his own copy of the Gnostic Mass].There is also a certain identity asserted between chaos and the Magus in the 3rdÆthyr, where Crowley receives somewhat of that Vision. At the conclusion thereof, heis told that the four-fold word chaos is the equivalent of the seven-fold word babalon.That should get your attention. chaos is further discussed in the 2nd (a personal favorite),where the Magister Templi, having become one with chaos, is married to babalonherself.I can also endorse Ben Rowe’s material (http://w3.one.net/~browe/enochian.htm),it’s a fine introduction to the subject.In passing, I will note that David believed (Crowley’s assumptions notwithstanding),that the Key to the oto lies in the 15th Æthyr, which is called oxo (based upon thename, among other things). I tend to agree with his evaluation. It is also noteworthythat in this Vision Pan is above the altar. This particular character appears to berepresented in the system as the central governor of the 22nd Æthyr, paraoan, or soDavid believed. It was this entity that David called in Santa Cruz, in a successful groupworking, on 15 April 1989. My own calling, somewhat later that same year, and thedata received through my skryer in that operation, appears to confirm his conclusion.In plowing through my Journals, as best I can tell, paraoan is the source of Chaos thatmanifested in our environment.In all sincerity, these brief comments I’ve made barely scratch the surface of thesubject. For me, the study of Enochian is the study of the Western Tradition. Dee is theprobable cause behind the Rosicrucian movement, and Elias Ashmole’s researches intothe Enochian System is a likely candidate for the source of (modern) freemasonry, and"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"19its attendant orders. Modern occultism in the West owes its greatest debt to the GoldenDawn, and that particular organization is a product of Enochian, as even a casualexamination of its origins will readily show. The System itself appears to incorporate,and build upon, elements of Jewish Mysticism (most notably, “Merkabah Kabalah”),that themselves may be traced to Babylon during the Captivity. From there, it may beassumed that it disappears into the mists surrounding the Sumerians, and the beginningsof “Western” civilization.Of human bondage, knots, and such: My extremely limited introduction to “ChinesePriest Cords” is from The Ashley Book of Knots, by Clifford W Ashley. I’ve been fascinatedwith knots and rope work since childhood. A friend of mine, when he learned that itwas the technique involved that held my attention as much, if not more so, than theerotic uses of same, declared me to be truly perverse, as opposed to the ordinary perversionof enjoying tying-up a willing female.Bondage is a definite theme in my experience of 156. In January of 2000, I becamequite literally obsessed with shibari, the Japanese art of rope bondage. It’s why thebondage theme in Michael Shuter’s illustrations of KAOS 13 caught my eye, and Ihoped that some part of the 156 current offered some tool that might be useful. After Ileft California, the reports I had of the developments in Santa Cruz contained manybondage elements, interspersed with the general sexual kink that I left too soon toenjoy. There seem to be several related bondage themes. The design of the Tarot Trump“The Devil”, being the most obvious. In so far as “The Devil” is a representation of Pan,there may be a connection between paraoan and the bondage theme that emergedback in 1990. I am a little unsure of the connection between Pan and Kaos. Perhaps youhave thoughts on this. Gardnerian Witchcraft incorporates both bondage andflagellation, in association with the Devil. The idea of being whomped-on by a HighPriestess is not particularly appealing, though I’m not as violently opposed to the ideaas I once was.My essay “The Black Lodge of Santa Cruz”: my understanding of events has deepenedas I’ve poured over my Journals. You were quite right, by the way. It is imperative that Imake some sense, if only for myself, of the events that led me to my exchanges withyou. This becomes more clear with each passing day I spend at the task. My greatestdifficulty is sifting through the many various themes and events, and determining whatis directly relevant to the tale. As noted above, paraoan seems central to the entirestory, in a way that is slowly resolving itself in my befuddled brain. But “he” standsabove and behind the work, as it were, and is not necessarily a major part of the narrativeitself. In this manner, that particular entity is not alone, and it’s a little tedious attemptingto tease-out the relative threads."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"20Your (our?) KAOS project has definitely taken on a life of its own. I’ve beencorresponding with [deleted for privacy], off and on. She’s somehow involved, as I’msure you’re aware. She recommended to me the book Finite and Infinite Games, by PaulCarse. This was the book that prepared me in a really profound way for your subsequentrevelations on alt.magick. It suggested to me that I hadn’t really “lost” back in 1990,and sent me back to studying and practicing magick just days before you began speakingof 156, and your kaos-babalon working.Take care, SATYR[Ed’s note—Concerning the 10th Æthyr, Crowley writes: “Then the Seer took the HolyRing, and wrote the name babalon, that is victory over Choronzon, and he was nomore manifest.” Implicit in this Æthyr therefore is the idea that Choronzon may bebanished “In Nomine Babalon”. This also appears to be the very moment when Crowleyat last “knew” Babalon, in the sense of the prophecy in Liber Legis I, 22: “I am known toye by my name Nuit, and to him by a secret name which I will give him when at last heknoweth me.”The 10th Æthyr in The Vision and the Voice, concerning Crowley’s dealings withChoronzon, is an amazing work of literature. The image of Choronzon being full ofmillions of mad voices whose greatest fear is silence, and that through silence themagician may best command him, is an acute insight. This Æthyr conjures up a fantasticimage of the Scribe in his protective circle drawn in the desert, dagger at hand, with theSeer sitting in the triangle where Choronzon manifests, a sacrificed pigeon in eachcorner of the triangle, blood seeping into the sand. Choronzon—the possessedCrowley—distracts the Scribe and throws sand to fill in and break part of the protectivecircumference of the circle, enabling him to enter and rush upon the Scribe.]Babalon and LilithHi Satyr—Here’s a few thoughts on your absolutely brilliant email on Babalon andEnochian, which I want to reproduce in KAOS. The discovery of Babalon in Dee is anotable thing.Looking through Geoffrey James’s The Enochian Magick of Dr John Dee (Llewellyn,1998) I have noticed an even more convincing Babalon reference in Dee than the firstoccurrence of the word in the Sixth Key. On p 100, in “The Key of the Thirty Ayres”,"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"21there occurs the word bábâlond, which is glossed as “Harlot”, the phrase reading Baglenpii tianta abábâlond od faórgt telocvovim (BAGLEN PII TIANTA ABABALONDOD FAORGT TELECVOVIM): “Bycause she is the bed of an Harlot, and thedwelling place of him that is faln.”Certainly The Vision and the Voice played a great part in the original inspiration forour kaos-babalon working, and it was interesting to re-read parts of it. Anyway, here’ssome notes I made as I studied your email, not as full as I’d like but I’d be interested inyour thoughts on Lilith.The Vision and the Voice, incidentally, also appears online at: http://www.sacred-texts.com/oto/418/418.htm. Though this has chapter by chapter as separate webpages,making it more difficult to search in its entirety, they’re better laid out for reading, andit has hyperlinked footnotes (the note numbers below are as they appear in this onlineedition). But you can’t beat a book for straightforward reading, and the 1998 Weiseredition is rather good, with some notes and illustrations that have not appeared in printbefore. Previously I had read it in Regardie’s Gems from the Equinox, which omits mostof the notes.In the note on Æthyr 24—“Now appears his mate, the heavenly Venus, the ScarletWoman, who by men is thought of as Babalon as he is thought of as Chaos.”—nowwho does “his” refer to, the “King of the New Aeon”, Horus?Mentioned in the 2nd Æthyr: “And this is the Mystery of the incest of chaos withhis daughter.” Not sure what this refers to.Any thoughts on the relationship between Babalon and Lilith? Lilith is mentionedin the 3rd Æthyr. When we were doing the kaos-babalon working the idea that Babalonand Lilith are sisters came up a lot, but I don’t recall ever reading that anywhere and I’mnot sure whether I fully understood that at the time (not intellectually I mean,experientially I resonated with it). Note 23 on the 3rd Æthyr says: “Lilith is truly Babalon,as imagined by this energy of Mayan.” (Presumably here Crowley is referring to maya,the Sanskrit word for “illusion”. In notes on the 2nd Æthyr he refers to “Mayan theGreat Sorcerer” and “Mayan, the logos who created the Universe of Illusion”.) Note 26says: “This is the Sigil of Binah in one of Her forms. It instantly destroys the illusion ofLilith, who now appears in her true shape as an avatar; a corporeal imagine [sic] ofbabalon, recalling the maiden of the 9th Æthyr.” The Sigil of Binah mentioned is ablack shining triangle, apex upwards, that came upon the face of the sun. (I have hadsomething similar—a black triangle, apex upwards, with three orange sun-like disksnear each of the corners—on my altar since Sept 27, 1996, but it was nothing to dowith reading this Æthyr). In note 31, interestingly enough, Crowley says: “The mysteryof chaos is beyond the comprehension of any but Masters of the Temple.” [In the"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"22Weiser 1998 edition of The Vision and the Voice these notes are p 217 n1, n4, and p 219n5, respectively—Ed]The only other Æthyr in which Lilith is named is the 2nd, but I’m not sure I understandthe reference there.JOEL[Ed’s note—The circumflex given in James on the middle “a” of bábâlond is atypographical convenience. In Sloane ms. 3191, which contains the Angelic Keys inDee’s handwriting, on folio 13r the mark is actually a breve (∪), intended to indicate ashort vowel. In the original ms. two further words are accented that are not indicated byJames: tiánta and telócvovim. In the original ms. abábâlond (“of an Harlot”) appearswith a hyphen: a-bábâlond. In Sloane ms. 3191, above and between “telóc” and “vovim”,Dee has written “tch”, indicating that the word is pronounced “telotch” rather than“telok”. Teloch, meaning “death”, appears on its own three times in the Keys in variantforms, in the 3rd (teloch), the 8th (téloah), and the 11th (telóch), and once as the compoundtelócvovim found in the Call of the 30 Æthyrs. Telocvovim appears to be a contractionof teloch (death) and vovim (dragon) to form “him that is faln”, about which I writemore later.]Hi Joel!—I’m glad you liked the email: I tried to rise to my scholarly best, and hopedthat I’d succeeded, and was aware of a certain degree of inspiration at the time. If youwish to reproduce it, I should be honored, and by all means do so. I’m afraid I hold nosuch hopes for this rambling, stumbling little number.In the note on Æthyr 24—“Now appears his mate...”—“his” appears to referencethe entity in the 25th. He, in the note on that Æthyr, is described as “the Lion God ofHorus, the child of Leo that incarnates him”. I don’t think this makes things any clearer,but it does at least hint that it is some “divine” aspect of the Beast. Jones used to claimthat the 25th was somehow related to methamphetamine. The “lion” might even refer tothe demiurge of the Gnostics, and cognate symbols, as well.As for “And this is the Mystery of the incest of chaos with his daughter.” I’m notentirely sure myself. chaos begets a daughter upon babalon, whom he then deflowersin the 4th Æthyr. Seems like a funky version of the formula of Tetragrammaton, whichI suppose it is in some sense. The vision of her is in the 9th, I think, where the daughteris set upon the throne of the mother. The consequence of that is the sex scene in the 4th.She also appeared, or at least a form of her appeared, to John Dee and Edward Kelly:http://www.hermetic.com/sabazius/kelly.htm.

I am wondering if there is a relationbetween the “black shining Triangle, with apex upwards” that appears in the 3rd Æthyr,and the “vast black triangle having the apex downwards”, that appears in the 2nd. I haveno thoughts on the matter, beyond thisobservation. It does seem relevant that thevision of one would follow closely on thevision of the other.As for “The mystery of chaos is beyondthe comprehension of any but Masters ofthe Temple.” This seems fairly obvious, atleast to me. The Master of the Temple sitsthere in Binah, utterly open and receptiveto the influence of Chokmah. Chokmah,as the Magus, is, in a sense, chaos. Binahbrings all things into manifestation: good,bad, indifferent. This manifestation onlyappears random and meaningless, good and evil, from below the Abyss, where Reasonhas power to make such distinctions. It also, with respect to the experiences and activitiesof you and I, reflects the relationship between the Yijing and the proper attitude towardsit, and the Oath of the Master of the Temple, as you have noted before. I hope I’vemade this clear, but doubt that I have.The reference to Lilith in the 2nd Æthyr is a little dense. I went back and read whatCrowley had to say about it in The Book of Thoth: it didn’t help much. I’m not sure heunderstood, or could explain, the concept himself. Lilith was the “mate” of Adam beforethe creation of Eve, according to Hebrew mythology. She bore him “children”, of a sort.Sitting here, I can’t really recall where I learned even that much. I found a reference toan article by Gershom Scholem, in which he relates that she and Samael issued frombeneath the throne of Divine Glory, and that their activities there rocked its legs a bit.I can appreciate Lilith and Babalon being “sisters”, in a similar sense as Isis andNephthys. I can also see Lilith as an Illusion that conceals Babalon. In purely material."},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"24terms, the physical manifestation of the Great Whore can be one dirty, stinky, grotesqueaffair. I don’t know if you’ve ever read Crowley’s “Leah Sublime”, but if you have, you’llcertainly know what I mean, it’s pure nastiness for it’s own sake. Crowley was assimilating“filth” into his conception of the Universe. The late Pat King (“King” of the Rite ofShiraz, and the official head of the 11th degree) once walked into a rather impressiveorgy, in full swing, and read the poem aloud. It stopped the orgy, cold. It is as if the firstillusion is the mundane perception of the whore as such. Moving past that, one sees heras symbolic of the object of desire she embodies (perhaps, the Scarlet Woman as anoffice?). Beyond that, we’re back to the grubby reality of Her corporeal form (this isLilith in the light of “the Sun” and an inevitable consequence of her corporeality),perceived as it “really is”. And beyond even this lies the Archetype, the Great Mother,Babalon herself. To subsist beyond the Abyss, She would have to embody both a “positive”and a “negative” symbolism. Perhaps, in this sense they are “sisters”, even as Michaeland Satan are “brothers”, twin symbols representing a unity of being.The Master of the Temple does naught but tend his garden. This is essentially apassive transmission of the influence of the Magus, and this is symbolized by the passiveacceptance of All by Babalon. The Master of the Temple transforms into the Magus byaction, overcoming the understanding that any action begets evil. Perhaps this issymbolized by Lilith, a more “active” form of “feminine evil”, milking the Word fromthe inert Master, and representing that evil and illusion that results from action.I apologize for rambling-on like this. I’m hoping something will shake loose. I’mnot too impressed by what I’ve written, but I’m sending it along anyway. I hope somegood might come of it.Take care, SATYRThe Daughter of FortitudeThe passage referred to above about the “Daughter of Fortitude”, who is possiblyidentifiable as the daughter of chaos and babalon who appears in Crowley’s vision inthe 9th Æythr, was received by Edward Kelly on May 23, 1587, and reads as follows:I am the Daughter of Fortitude, and ravished every hour, from my youth.

TrebonæGeneralis”, ff. 218–220. In Clay Holden’s transcription from the Cotton Appendix hesays that “Circle of the Stone” in Casaubon’s transcription should be “circle of the sonne”.Three years earlier the Enochian Keys were received, and, though it’s a minorcomparison, for some reason when reading the above passage certain words and phrasesstood out to me as being reminiscent of phrases in the Keys. For instance, “the beasts ofthe field” appears in the 19th Key where it is represented by the single Enochian wordLevithmong (LEVITHMONG). Also both “dwelling places” (fargt FARGT) and“dwelling place” (faórgt FAORGT) occur in the same 19th Key, in an extended passagethat refers to a harlot. “The Sons of Comfort” is a curious phrase, the word “comfort”occurs nines times in the Keys (5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 16, 18 [twice], 19) and in the 4th Key is thephrase “the sons of Pleasure” (Nor quasáhi NOR QUASAHI). In Crowley’s vision inthe 9th Æthyr the “daughter of babalon”, who is also the “daughter of the King”, is “shethat is set upon the Throne of Understanding”, whereas in the above passage the“Daughter of Fortitude” says of herself “I am Understanding”. In modern tarot packsthe trump “Fortitude” portrays a woman either wrenching open or forcing shut thegaping jaws of a lion, which is echoed in the wonderful phrase in the passage receivedby Kelly, “The Lion knoweth not where I walk”.

On learningthey would make a good match he took her off to North Africa in his chariot.)JBLilith in early literatureConcerning Lilith, Isaiah 34:14 (circa 900 BC) is often said to refer to Lilith, althoughthis is contested by some scholars. Raphael Patai translated this verse as: “The wild-catshall meet with the jackals | And the satyr shall cry to his fellow, | Yea, Lilith shallrepose there | And find her a place of rest.” The 1901 American Standard Versiontranslates the verse as: “And the wild beasts of the desert shall meet with the wolves,and the wild goat shall cry to his fellow; yea, the night-monster shall settle there, andshall find her a place of rest.” In the footnotes for “night-monster” it says “Hebrew:Lilith”. Other translations include: nightjar, night hag, screech owl (King James Version),and night devil. This fits in with the popular Hebrew etymology, which derives “Lilith”from “layil”, “night”, although the word Lilith is usually derived from the Babylonian-Assyrian word “lilitu”, “a female demon, or wind-spirit”—one of a triad mentioned inBabylonian spells.The first literary reference to Lilith appears in the Sumerian tale “Gilgamesh andthe Huluppu-Tree” (2000 BC), where she is a demoness dwelling in the trunk of what isprobably a willow tree tended by the goddess Inanna (Ishtar). This tale forms the key tounderstanding the twelfth tablet of the Epic of Gilgamesh, the first twelve lines of whichare almost completely crumbled away. Without the explanation offered by the “HuluppuTree” story, the twelfth tablet is mystifying, and so many scholars include the “HuluppuTree” as part of the epic. The twelfth tablet begins in the middle of a lament by Gilgameshthat the mysterious objects pukku and mikku have fallen into the underworld. In thestory of the Huluppu Tree, Inanna finds the uprooted tree floating in the Euphratesand plants it in her garden in Uruk, planning to make a bed and a chair from its wood.But a serpent makes its nest in the root of the tree, the Zu bird builds a nest for itsyoung in the crown, and the demoness Lilith builds her house in its trunk. WhenGilgamesh hears that Inanna is distraught at not being able to use the wood of the tree,he comes and slays the serpent with his axe, and the terror-stricken Zu bird flees withits young to the mountains, while Lilith escapes to the desert (which is possibly where"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"27Isaiah 34:14 picks up the story). Gilgamesh and his men then fell the tree so Inanna canmake her bed and chair. In gratitude she makes the pukku (drum?) from the base of thetree and the mikku (drumstick?) from the crown, and gives them to Gilgamesh. Hencein the twelfth tablet of the epic we find Gilgamesh lamenting the loss of these objects,the identification of which is still not certain, to the underworld. The coupling of Lilithwith the serpent in the Huluppu Tree in Inanna’s garden of course is similar to theGarden of Eden story.In later lore Lilith becomes a succubus and child-slayer. The Alphabet of Ben Sira(circa AD 800) introduces the most famous element of the story, that Lilith was the firstwife of Adam who refused to lie under him for sex and abandoned him, fleeing theGarden of Eden. This text is believed to be an early parody of Hebrew literature. Lilithappears as the female of Samael in the Zohar (circa AD 1200), where she is described asan abominable harlot who stands on street corners to attract men. Forlong’s A Cyclopediaof Religions (London, 1906) makes an interesting observation: “Lilith became the consortof Samael and together they are ‘the Beast’...”Robert Graves and Raphael Patai note in Hebrew Myths that Asmodeus and otherdemons were born of sexual union between Adam and Lilith and another like hernamed Naamah, Tubal Cain’s sister, and that “Solomon suspected the Queen of Shebaof being Lilith, because she had hairy legs”. Graves and Patai also identify the twounnamed harlots who come before Solomon to have the ownership of a child decidedin 1 Kings 3:16 as Lilith and Naamah, presumably because a child of one of the womenhas died in the night, which links with the motif of Lilith as a child-slayer and night-monster. The evidence for this association appears slim to me. As for there being arelationship between Babalon and Lilith, I have found no early textual support for thisidea and so at present it remains an occult association to be further explored.JBBabalon the Whore: of the light?Ok could someone please tell me what this fascination with Babalon the Whore is?The A∴A∴, the oto, and other groups often claim to be servants of the light. I wouldlike to know how certain magicians who are on the right hand path, in service to theTetragrammaton, to purity, to light, to passiveness, to control etc can use icons such asThe Beast 666, Baphomet, and of course Babalon. In Liber ABA Crowley says that this"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"28information shall be transmitted only orally. Is it just that I don’t understand the meaningsof these icons, or am I dead on when I say they are more “negative”, “dark” and “lefthand pathed”? I don’t find much light and wisdom in Baphomet and especially in theWhore. When I think of the brilliance of Kether and the host of archangels, the Whoreis not exactly imagery that I find to be consistent with these holy creatures. Crowleydid some great stuff, no doubt, but a lot of the Thelemic followers use these symbols,and Baphomet is not exactly a symbol of light and goodness to me. Could someoneplease explain this, because I honestly would like to get things straight. Thank you...Lux Via EstCHRISYou apparently have a specific idea in your mind of what Babalon is about, and havedecided you don’t like this idea and can’t see it as being “of the light”. It’s possible youdon’t have the same idea about Her that her devotees have; or that you do have theright idea, but are unable to see that Her attributes are “of the light”.In a Qabalistic framework, Babalon is the divine expression of the sephiroth Binah;that is, She is the wholly divinized idea of the feminine, encompassing more aspectsthan I could name here. These include ideas reminiscent of Bast and Sekhet, Shaktiand Kali, and others.The phrase “of the light” (that is, l.v.x.) is a little misleading, too. If I were to say,“Oh, no, you’ve got Her all wrong, She’s not of the Light, She’s of the Dark,” that wouldgive the wrong idea because you’d probably think I meant the Infernal darkness. I donot. I mean the Supernal darkness, which Crowley called n.o.x. (that’s the problem ofeither-or, Light vs Dark thinking). This n.o.x. is not the antithesis of l.v.x., but moreits successor in the spiritual journey. n.o.x. is the consciousness of the Supernals by thegateway of Binah, as l.v.x. is the consciousness of adepthood by way of Tiphareth.Think of the blissful, splendid, unending darkness of outer space that comes after onerises into the air-refracted solar light of the atmosphere. This is not at all the darknessthat comes from digging a hole in the ground and climbing in. It is more LIGHT thanthe Light. It appears dark because the personality’s sensorium cannot assimilate it. Its“darkness” is akin to what St John called “the Dark Night of the Soul”, which is a dryfever of love for God so passionate and overwhelming that it burns us painfully andwithout release.Babalon is called “whore” for many reasons besides the purely physical-sexual. But,especially, She is an aspect of divinity that absorbs all—that “takes all comers”. She is"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"29that within us which remains open to taking in indiscriminately, and being filled by,anything and everything that comes in the course of life.

Ifihvh is your image for the Most High, then that which you are calling by that Name Iwould call by another. Regardless—you profess to be trying to understand where othersare coming from. The ancient Gnostic view of ihvh is as the brat upstart demiurgewho reaches no farther up the Tree than Chesed (He is of the number 4)—that is, fallsbelow the Abyss, outside the Supernal realm, as a mental-moral construct. If this is theihvh you mean, then Babalon is a higher idea. If you mean the early Kabbalisticreferences to ihvh as the Divine Name of Tiphareth, then Babalon, as Lady of Binah,is the higher idea.Purity? Yes, absolutely, though we would probably differ on what the word means.(It certainly doesn’t mean prudish, for example. All sexuality is sacred.) In service topassiveness? I’m sure we differ more here than in anything else you said! Receptive, yes.Taking all comers, yes. Passive? No. (Except as a delicious counterpoint to Active.)Control? Discipline is an essential part of the Great Work, just as it is to great sex. Also,surrender is essential to both. (Even at the gutter level, if you think a typical whore iswithout control, you should go out and meet a few more, because you’ve got the wrongidea, babe.)As for oral transmission, some of it can only be translated orally. As for whetherBabalon and Baphomet are “left hand path”, some people who identify themselves aslhp embrace these deities as falling in that category. But the deities themselves are notso narrow. Any Supernal idea stands outside dualistic labels of this kind from below theAbyss. When you say that you “don’t find much light and wisdom in Baphomet”, youare, perhaps, unaware that “Baphomet” was a Kabbalistic code word that a group ofChristian military monks coined to veil the Gnostic idea of Sophia—one of the mostsublime and holy ideas ever to infuse Western civilization’s spirituality.Respectfully, I submit that you cannot think of the brilliance of Kether. Respectfully,I suggest that your highest idea of Kether is no more than a reflection of Tiphareth andmight, in fact, really be only a reflection of that in Yesod. This is not intended as a put-down of any kind. Kether is beyond thought.The hosts of archangels of which you speak are a lesser domain of spiritual beingthan Babalon.

It does seem, on examination, at least asprofound as you say.I know how you hate kabbalah-babble, but if we take it as Hebrew, we get:ivblqin (}yqlbwy) = 10+6+2+30+100+10+700 = 858 (taking Nun final as 700) = athegbvr lovlm adni “To Thee be Power unto the Ages, my Lord”, traditionally seenabbreviated by the notariqon agla, the “god name” used for North/Earth in the LesserRitual of the Pentagram.From an etymological standpoint, ivbl (lbwy) can mean “stream”, or “river”, and qin(}yq) can be taken as “to form”, or “to prepare”.ivbl is assumed in Genesis 4:21 to mean the sound of musical instruments (liketrumpets, with a hint of Revelation and the Koran), but there is also the obviousassociation with the Jubilee (shnth h-ivbl), the year in which slaves were to be freed.Thus, my two favorite possible readings so far are “to form a current”, and “to preparea Jubilee”, using, of course, the traditional rough-and-ready etymologies appropriate toa kabbalistic discourse of this kind.There is also an implied union of male and female, since qne (possible root of thename “Cain”), can mean “to erect” or “a reed” (again we get a whiff of Revelation, witha little Prometheus thrown in for good measure), and ibl (a possible root of “Jubal”),can be read as “to flow, especially copiously” or “to produce, to bring forth”. qin itself is translated as “spear” in 2 Samuel 21:16 (the verse here cited tells theweight of the spear hefted by the Philistine giant who nearly slew David.

The general impression fromliterature and discussion is that currents exist for a while and then fade away, beingreplaced by another, more vital current.In the past few decades there have been claims for the “93 current”, “Ma’at current”,“Lam current”, the “Nu-Isis current”, the “Typhonic current”, the “Transplutoniccurrent”, the “Current of the Seven Rays” (emanating from the constellation Leo, norelation to the ota [Ordo Templi Astarte—Ed]), and the “Sirius current”.agla"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"32In hearing Joel’s description of the kaos-babalon current, I began to wonder ifthere were only one current that is apprehended by individuals at different times. To usea clumsy metaphor, explorers named the bits of North America in which they landedby a host of different names, yet it was but one land mass.If the current of creation is a constantly evolving, constantly changing phenomenon,then any attempt to label it as the “xyz current” is error unless it is accepted that such acurrent is in a state of constant evolution. This is difficult for any individual, no matterhow advanced: some concepts are not as easily discarded as others.For instance, Crowley tapped into a live current in his invocations of Babalon, as didParsons. (Many of those who followed failed to appreciate the dynamic nature of life,and looked in the places where the current was last found.) The existence and similarityin nature of all these suggests to me the existence of one current, that has been accessedby many individuals over time, under a myriad of names.The nature of the feminine component of this current has been discussed, attackedand censored over centuries, but it has been discussed. The nature of the male componentof this current has been sadly lacking in any substantive discussion or commentaryuntil relatively recently. Joel’s views would seem to be exceptionally useful no matterhow his ideas are viewed, precisely because they stimulate thought on this area.It’s far more important, in the view from here, to try and consider the nature ofkaos-babalon than it is to discuss how kaos should be spelt. Too many words, whichalmost guarantees misunderstanding. Lock and load.RICHARD SPRIGGYes, I believe that the “same” (using the term loosely) current has attracted differentnames at different times (though the “Lam current” is an absolute joke, a current basedon a lousy drawing of an alien by Crowley, I ask you!). But, and this I think is theimportant point, “the” current progresses and changes its nature, as does a river, samewater maybe but different landscape, different terrain, different force of current too. Ibelieve that kaos-babalon is the magical current for now, which is not the samecurrent as 93, for instance, but did emerge from it and left it behind, and that is thenature of its “sameness”. kaos-babalon 156 current may well change its nature later onand that name will no longer be so relevant. I trace it out of 93 and Babalon, andpossibly the Ma’at current played a part.It’s interesting in tracing routes that my own contact with Babalon came becauseshe wrote to me asking to be put in touch with Maggie Ingalls, ie Nema, prophetess ofthe Ma’at current, who I had published work by in KAOS (after the split with Grant),"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"33and I was myself involved in a Ma’at grouping for a period organised by AlistairLivingstone and his partner Pinki/Tanith, whose work is little known among occultistsbut I found highly inspiring, and contact with them did advance a lot of ideas for meand there was a mutual cross-fertilisation in “the scene” at that time. This was a fiveyear period, 1985–89, during which I met and learnt from an extraordinary variety ofvery talented individuals, all of whom must be credited with adding in pieces of thepuzzle that was later formulated as kaos-babalon 156 current. It is a pity that manyThelemites are so ignorant of these changes, interactions, and subtleties that they remainstuck in 93 as if the world did not go forward. 93 was formulated by a handful of peopleand now a mass of people blindly follow it, 156 was similarly formulated by a handfulof people, and who knows how many will eventually follow it. I just hope they do notdo so blindly and that similar talented individuals will emerge who recognise when ithas changed its nature and what to do about it for the reformulation that will becomenecessary. Constant regurgitation of the past is not a service to the future.JOELEpiphany of the fewYes Joel, I agree with your statements on currents. That which we call a current is, in myview, a point in a process rather than a thing. By “process” I do not mean an orderlyseries of phenomena or reactions, but an ongoing change and evolution, constantly influx.93 was the name applied to a point in the process at the time. Change in the currentis almost guaranteed, unless the individual using it sees past the nomenclature to theprocess itself, which is pretty much the nature of dynamic magick.Such an individual will likely, at that point, either develop a revised set of symbols todescribe their vision, or change their understanding of the symbols they are using toconform to their new views.There are as few Thelemites as there ever were, methinks. There is, however, anembarrassment of Crowleyites. No surprise that a few formulated 93 and now manyblindly follow it.The epiphany of the few becomes the litany of the many.

The Curse of Lam was upon Staley.I do not know if Staley has a regular shag, but I do know he’s 9° in the Typhonianoto and will probably be Grant’s successor, although there is a toady in the wings whomight be kissed. Staley has substantially developed the Cult of Lam the Pastel Alien(does he have a partner?). Staley, who edits the Typhonian journal Starfire, has stated:“The emerging Cult of Lam is of central importance to Starfire.” Call me cynical if youwill, but over the years I have singularly failed to comprehend why a naff drawing of an"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"36alien should inspire such earnest devotion, yet in 1989 Starfire published “The LamStatement” (Vol. I, No. 3) and in 1994 Staley gave a lecture entitled “The Mysteries ofLam”.

Acting on channelledinformation Staley has given the head of Lam a serpent body and associated it with thekundalini firesnake, while at the same time denying it is synonymous with the firesnake.Whether it is synonymous with the one-eyed trousersnake has not been addressed thusfar in print. Hey are there any chicks in on this, I could get hip to a swinging scene.Current research by Staley has suggested to him that Lam was in fact Crowley’sguru (email to Peter Koenig, June 2001). Such diversification born of a simple aliensketch is surely an astonishing object lesson in how one should never throw away one’slousy drawings, or, if one does, be sure to give them to Kenneth Grant, because he’llmake something out of it.

Oh well, at least it’s got him off the ibis sticking its beak upits ass and the huge titty octopus.None of this tittle-tattle, however, can beat a story told to me in the FreemasonsArms the other day by a Knight of the Pelican and Eagle (18°), who heard from thehorse’s mouth about the shock Roger Parisious had on staying overnight with Mr andMrs Ellic Howe:Roger Parisious is an American born in Ohio and educated during the late 1960s atColumbia University in New York. He was subsequently appointed as Archivist to theYeats family at a time when he was able to meet a number of people who had knownYeats directly. He was also interested in the Golden Dawn and occult revival. Heestablished contact with Ellic Howe and after several meetings was invited for dinner.Staying overnight he rose the next morning and found his host and his wife in an attitudeof prayer before the image of a fish (which Roger interpreted as symbol of Isis ratherthan Christ).So, there you have it, the renowned masonic historian and author of The Magicians ofthe Golden Dawn, who always denied any practical interest in the occult, in his privatehours worshipped a fish with his wife. The genteel side of suburban occultism.By contrast, no-one could doubt that Kenneth Grant is one hell of a meanass occultist.In Nightside of Eden Grant details a hard-nosed ritual he was doing in 1949 with GeraldGardner and a few others evoking an extraterrestrial intelligence by circumambulatinga sigil drawn on parchment by Austin Spare; there came a knock at the door interrupting"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"37the ritual, it was an occult bookseller who declined to come up on hearing Mr Grantwas present.

In this book Grant has elevated Lam, ratherpredictably, to the status of leader of the Greys (p 9). On pages 284 and 323 he claimsthat Lam was the leader of a party of aliens who crashed their spacecraft in Chinathousands of years ago, known as the “Dropas” in contemporary ufo folklore, a supposedcrash first written about in the Soviet journal Sputnik in the early 1960s, which the ufoloony Hartwig Hausdorf wrote about in his 1998 book The Chinese Roswell. Grant’ssource of information on the Dropas appears to have been the awful book by RobertCharroux, Masters of the World (1967), which generally propounds the idea that theworld is controlled by beings from Venus. Grant writes in his glossary: “Research hasrevealed Lam’s identity as leader of the Dropas who visited Earth from outer voids.”Another of Grant’s favourite sources for “research” is Gerald Massey, whose massivetestimony to wasted time The Natural Genesis (1883) I once threw across the room in afit of disgust on reading his comparision of the supposed pronunciation of an Egyptianhieroglyph with an obscure dialect word from Norfolk.]"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"38A brief evolution of “MrsPaterson”, witch mentor toAustin Osman Spareby David CantuDid a Mrs Paterson actually exist? Let us start away from Grant, but just for a moment.The only reliable reference I find to Mrs Paterson outside of Kenneth Grant is: FromInferno to Zos Vol. III—Michelangelo in a Teacup: Austin Osman Spare by F W Letchford.Frank Letchford became friends with Spare in 1937. Letchford says:Kenneth Grant has described Mrs Paterson as an elderly colonial clairvoyant whoinstructed Austin in the Tarot, Ouija board and other means of occult communication.Indeed Austin mentioned the woman in vague terms to myself; she must have diedbefore the Great War. Her portrait is said to appear in The Focus of Life, and in anotherdrawing is seen as a young girl transformed into a terrifying witch. [p 147]So apparently she did exist, at least in Spare’s mind.Now we move into Grant territory and a thing becomes clear. Mrs Paterson becomesa myth to work Grant’s world around, a ghost from a mouldable past. I wish to make itclear that I have a high regard for Grant’s world-building abilities and have found hispoint of view helpful in many ways, however it will be hard to find the “truth” of MrsPaterson in Grant’s work, though she shows up there in profusion. Over the years MrsPaterson has become a link to dark Lovecraftian magick that supposedly originatedwith Indians of Narragansett provenance in the USA.Paterson was supposed to be descended from Salem witches, but all of this plays alittle too well into Kenneth Grant’s cosmogony, not that it couldn’t be true."},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"39Grant has even uncovered a document purported to be from Paterson’s covens whichmentions such names as Syth Ooloo (water), Syth Odowogg (fire), Hru Syth (air),Shognigoth (earth), all from a document called “Entreating the Stones”. Syth is, ofcourse, Set.Grant introduced Mrs Paterson in 1972 in The Magical Revival:Spare’s intense interest in the more obscure aspects of sorcery sprang from his earlyfriendship with an old colonial woman who claimed descent from a line of Salem witchesthat Cotton Mather had failed to exterminate. Spare always alluded to her as MrsPaterson, and called her his “second mother”. She had an extremely limited vocabularycomposed mainly of fortunetellers’ argot, yet she was able to define and explain themost abstract ideas much more clearly than could Spare with his large and unusualvocabulary. [p 180–181]Paterson is seen as the source of Spare’s knowledge:Although penniless, she would accept no payment for her fortune-telling, but insistedon the odd symbolic coin traditionally exacted as a sacrifice fee. Apart from her skill indivining, she was the only person Spare ever met who could materialize thoughts tovisible appearance. [p 181]Grant then goes on to talk of this “siddhi” and how Paterson was supposed to have usedit on clients when words failed her to project “a clearly defined, if fleeting, image of theprophesied event”.It is clear that Ken Grant was painting a larger than life picture from the beginningeven if Austin Spare did relate these things to him. Paterson next appears in Cults of theShadow, 1975. Grant adds that:Spare was initiated into the vital current of ancient and creative sorcery by an aged womannamed Paterson, who claimed descent [...] the formation of Spare’s Cult of Zos and Kiaowes much to his contact with Witch Paterson ... [p 196]Now we come to a little technique:These magicians utilized human embodiments of power (shakti) which appeared—usually—in feminine form [...] in the case of Austin Spare, the Fire Snake assumed theform of Mrs Paterson, a self-confessed witch who embodied the sorceries of a cult soancient that it was old in Egypt’s infancy. [p 203]"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"40This seems to be Grant’s first real linking of Paterson to “Lovecraftian” matters. Heexpands on this:These theories have their roots in very ancient practices, some of which—in a distortedform—provided the basis of the medieval Witch Cult, covens of which flourished inNew England at the time of the Salem Witch Trials at the end of the 17th century.[p 207]This is very close to the end of the book, which he ends with:When the occult significance of primal symbols is fathomed at the Draconian level, thesystem of sorcery Spare evolved through contact with ‘Witch’ Paterson becomesexplicable, and all magical circles, sorceries, and cults are seen as manifestations of theShadow. [p 208]In some ways the word Shadow later evolved into Mauve in Beyond the Mauve Zone. In1980 Grant added a little to the myth in Outside the Circles of Time. Mrs Paterson getsa first name: Yelg. He is talking about 333 Choronzon (Yog-Sut-Thoth) creating:... the event act called The Beast, viz: the creative vortex in the Æther that gives rise tothe manifestation of phenomena via the mechanics of atavistic resurgence. As such, theprocess is identical with the method of sorcery practiced by Austin Osman Spare in ZosKia Cultus. He had derived it from his witch-mentor, Yelg Paterson. She in turn hadbeen initiated by her Salem forebears who had spiritual rapport with disembodiedAmerican Indian sorcerers, who in times long past had established a Gate for the GreatOld Ones. The number of Yelg is 48, which is that of kvkb ‘a star’, the ‘Star of Chivan’,the Beast, from the Egyptian Kheb, ‘Typhon’, and Khabs, ‘star’, thus equating the nameYelg with the Star of Typhon and the Typhon Current generally. [p 225]An undercurrent here seems to imply more than a friendly relationship between Spareand Paterson. Spare was, of course, often known for his “love” of elderly women.Finally in 1994 we hear about the unearthed document (Syth-Ooloo...) in OuterGateways. This is later expanded on in the “fictional” novella, Against the Light publishedby Starfire Publishing in 1997.The following extracts are from Outer Gateways:I propose here to treat of Spare’s sorcery, which had its origins in the Amerindian witchcult refracted through Yelg Paterson, who claimed descent from Salem witches [...]"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"41more information has come to light concerning Yelg’s spirit guide, Black Eagle. Thisentity was the ‘control’ behind several covens, two of which were directed by Yelg Paterson.She claimed that Black Eagle was of Narragansett provenance.

Paterson was the link between this cult, whose votaries she knew as the ‘AncientWinds’, and several writers and artists [...] such as Blackwood, Rohmer, Lovecraft,Roerich ... [p 17]The coven headed by Paterson seems to have been a fluid and nomadic group. It wasbased in South Wales, and she is known to have evoked Black Eagle ... [p 17]Since the publication of Images & Oracles (1975) fresh light has been thrown upon Spare’soccult affinities with the Old Ones. It is now considered probable that the name Yelga,hitherto supposed to have been the first name of Zos’s ‘witch-mother’, Mrs Paterson, isin fact Yelder, which is not a name but a designation. Spare suffered a mild form ofdyslexia which occasionally affected his speech and his writing. Examples are hismispronunciation of the name of his friend, Hannen Swaffer, as Swather, and hisconviction that in illustrating (for the Bodley Head in 1911) The Starlit Mire, he hadilluminated aphorisms composed by the philosopher Bertrand Russell when, in fact, thebook had two authors, James Bertram and F Russell. [p 24]Spare, like Crowley, sometimes dipped into erudite works on witchcraft produced by theRev Montague Summers. In that divine’s work, The Werewolf (1933), page 29, appears areference to ‘yelder-eyed witches’. The word ‘yelder’ may well be an elision of ‘Ye Elder’,which Spare doubtless thought applicable to the aged Mrs Paterson. However, the wordsuffered further erosion and came from his lips as Yelga. In consideration of Mrs Paterson’sconnection with the Old Ones and the Elder Gods, as focussed through Black Eagle,the applicability of the term now seems to have been singularly appropriate. What iscertain is that through Mrs Paterson, Spare was first enabled to traffic with occult entitiesthat were survivals of ancient witchcraft, and, based on his experience of them, to evolvea unique system of sorcery.

Since Grant is unreliable from ahistorical perspective, if Spare does not mention Mrs Paterson save through Grant’swords then it seems Frank Letchford’s testimony as to the existence of Mrs Paterson isthe best we have. And I note that Letchford says only that Austin mentioned her invague terms. We could assume, given that Letchford must rely on Grant for the ratherroutine information that she was “an elderly colonial clairvoyant who instructed Austinin the Tarot, Ouija board and other means of occult communication”, that these termswere indeed so vague that Austin may not even have mentioned her by name to Letchford,and that for this too he is reliant upon Grant. Spare appears to have mentioned littlemore to Letchford than that there was a woman in his past who was important to himin some way. Even Letchford’s statement that her portrait may be in The Focus of Life isqualified as secondhand information: “Her portrait is said to appear in The Focus ofLife.” That doesn’t make it sound like Spare ever opened up the book and said to himthis is a picture I did of Mrs Paterson. Does Grant, indeed, say that her portrait appearsin The Focus of Life? Indeed he does, in 1972 in The Magical Revival:He drew several portraits of Mrs Paterson, one of which appeared in The Focus of Life,published by the Morland Press in 1921. Another drawing of her by Spare recentlyappeared (1971) in the part-work encyclopaedia Man, Myth and Magic, where she isshown after having “exteriorized” herself in the form of a nubile girl. [p 181]So it seems Letchford is probably relying on Grant for this information, relatingrecollections of vague things Spare mentioned to him to specific things written by"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"43Grant. Does Spare imply in The Focus of Life that it contains a picture of Mrs Paterson?No he doesn’t, neither the text nor the titles of the plates mention Mrs Paterson byname or give any hint that might suggest her. It appears we are reliant on KennethGrant’s sayso that Spare said one of the nude drawings in The Focus of Life was of MrsPaterson. Similarly, we have only Grant’s assurance that the picture referred to in Man,Myth and Magic is of Mrs Paterson.Spare published his last pre-Grant work in 1924, Anathema of Zos. He publishednothing afterwards. He met Grant in 1947 and supposedly began work on the ZosGrimoire in 1948 and continued until his death in 1956. So he wrote nothing for 24years after Anathema of Zos. Why did he begin to write again? In a footnote in theintroduction to the Book of Pleasure Spare mentions many drawings and chapters thatwere left out of the book; in Outer Gateways Grant explains:Spare had intended using the illustrations but he never wrote the chapters suggested bythem. Their substance, in the form of notes inspired by Yelda Paterson, was destroyedduring World War II. When I got to know him, I persuaded him to reformulate the lostmaterial. He did so, and it survives in the form of the Grimoire of Zos, parts of which Iincluded nearly thirty years later in Images & Oracles of Austin Osman Spare. [p 29]The question remains, to what extent is the Austin Osman Spare we know from thewritings of Kenneth Grant a fictional product of Grant’s mind? Personally, I find theportrait of Spare that emerges in Frank Letchford’s book far more engaging. Take forinstance this wonderful observation on Spare’s home life in contrast to his earlier socialpretensions and brief flirtation with an artistic salon:What was the attraction to this circle for a youth fresh from working class surroundings?Was he hypnotized by the charm and social courtesies? The democratic outlook, was itgenuine? Would it not have been a strain on his nerves to keep up a pretence, or was hebehaving in his natural manner? Certainly he must have maintained a false front onsocial etiquette for it was his habit to eat cake off The Evening Standard in later years.[p 61]I also enjoyed a letter Spare wrote to Letchford on October 15, 1939, in which heenclosed a sigil he had drawn but noted that he was unable to say whether the sigil was“bollocks or something touching a reality greater than we know and only badly expressed,so far, in ancient Fairy Tales”. [p 183]JOEL"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"44Joel—There is little doubt that Yelg (Ye Elder) Paterson is an evolving mythologicalcreation of Kenneth Grant, designed to suit his cosmogony. In his years of work, wewatch her evolve from a lowly fortune-teller to the leader of an ancient witch cult,trafficking with the Great Old Ones. While it can still be argued that a real thingemerges through such artists as Spare and Lovecraft, there is little doubt that Mr Granthas spun things around to his own ends. The ends of a master builder of cosmogony.Few realized that Grant was such an expert chaos magician!There is also little doubt that Austin Spare has been subjected to some of the sametreatment. At the very least, most people’s ideas of Spare have been colored by Grant’sinterpretation of him. Anyone looking at Spare’s automatic art and early writings cansense a true connection with the “outer” but the concretization of his vague myth into afirm portrait seems to owe much to Grant’s fertile imagination.But just how well did Grant know Spare and his work? Did Spare actually sit downand “explain” his work to Grant, or has Grant interpreted it? To answer these questionswe have no choice but to turn to Grant’s diaries, published in Zos Speaks, which chroniclehis activities with the “later” Spare from March 16, 1949, until Spare’s death on May15, 1956. It is pretty clear that their relationship was never as deep as Grant had alwaysled us to believe. Often it was a matter of Spare begging for supplies and trying to getexhibitions, while Grant would egg him on about working on magick. He seemedcontent to be poor and have a lot of cats. Toward the end Spare started to become a bitof a burden on the Grants and they drifted apart until shortly before his death. You, ofcourse, came to the same basic conclusion as I, man ⇒ myth ⇒ magick.DAVIDThe Illuminates of ThanaterosHey Joel—I’m curious, what is your criticism of the iot? I’m not interested in gossip orpersonality conflicts with people, I’d like to know what criticism you have of the textsthey use or the structure of the group, stuff like that. I only ask because your opinionshave been referred to by you and others in various texts, but I’ve never been clear onwhat those opinions actually are. And it may give me a better understanding of whatyou mean when you talk about chaos magick.MIKA"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"45My basic criticism is that most of the “defining works” of “chaos magick” lack depth.The iot started as an organisation set up by and for people of little occult insight whohad a distaste for hierarchy and real initiation. That was about it really. It got togethera series of techniques that were but pale imitations of hierarchical ritual, fostered a tastefor eclecticism, introduced pretend initiation, and, oddly enough, lots of people withlittle occult insight and imagination started raving about it, no doubt because it appearedto them to be a shortcut into the occult.When I came along to see what all the fuss was about in 1985 I was flabbergastedthat such rubbish was the basis of what had rapidly become known as “the Chaoscurrent”. Yet I also knew that this current had a true aspect and I sought to bring outthat aspect and evolve it, which meant I had to dispense with what I considered to bethe “glister” of the current. So, when you ask me what is my criticism of the iot, perhapsyou expect me to point out some deep ideological divide or something. No such luck,that I would have more time for, it is simply that it is shallow rubbish peddled assomething deep. I wouldn’t actually consider it at all worthwhile going through one oftheir texts to do a point-by-point critique, I dismiss it as trash.That said, the Chaos current did actually manage to attract later on quite a fewtalented individuals, which was great because it meant we could get something farmore interesting going, something founded on new and evolving insights and comingout of a greater understanding of the Western Magical Tradition, something profound,not just a veneer of lame anarchy sprayed over a ragbag of occult techniques with littleencompassing vision of the whole of which they were a part.It truly astonished me that anyone could find anything amazing or interesting aboutthe vision of the occult propounded by the likes of the iot, and yet they did, in theirdroves, and still do. To me it is a sad indication of the demise of the occultist. It becamean accessory to a certain lifestyle that involved liking certain bands and wearing a blackteeshirt and in the end I began to criticise it in Situationist terms, which seemed to goover the heads of those I was criticising. Given the Situationist perspective it was to beexpected that the pop version of the Chaos current should have become well-knownand widely propagated, whereas the true occult Chaos current (156) went underground.JOEL"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"46The call of the Cthulhu “mythos”Joel—On Cthulhu magick—Well the actual rub is, if in some sense they are trying toinvest these fictional creations with some kind of spirit life—making a kind of artificialspirit—they are certainly not making the beings according to H P Lovecraft. Besides,only a complete and total idiot would... they don’t exist to grant power to mortals; theycertainly don’t exist to be made tools of by mortals—they want to devour and destroy...that’s what they do. And really, their description by Lovecraft is the only one thatcounts (ok and maybe his writing children). Even those magicians who suggest investingfictional creations with “life” to be in the realms of possibility, would probably suggestthat you are dependant on the form taken by the being as it is already “described in theCollective Unconscious”.If you call it Cthulhu but you describe it as a helpful spirit... well it just ain’t Cthulhu.Certainly the “shoggoth” summoning spells of chaos magick don’t represent the Lovecraftoriginal; rather, just a borrowing of the name as it makes for kewl spelz. Mind you,many of these people also think that blood-sucking, undead vampires are real and thatthe main public view of them doesn’t come from the imaginations of the creator ofVarney and Bram Stoker but was rather “channelled” to them to reveal the “Truth”—asis often asserted by those who insist that Lovecraft was not the actual creator of hisstories but a mere participant in an automatic writing session from “beyond the gates”.Lovecraft would likely suggest that such individuals were escaped inmates from Bedlam.That vibrating sound isn’t the arrival of a wandering evil from beyond the stars... it’sHoward Phillip spinning in his Rhode Island grave. The beings written of in the fictionaltales by Lovecraft (an admitted non-believer in magic) or bastardized for role-playinggames were so totally inimical to humanity that only those possessed or insane wouldever deliberately summon them, and those others who did so by accident were eitherdead, soul-devoured, or hopelessly mad by the end of the story.

They were great charactersfor horror stories. That’s it. They certainly don’t have the provenance of the majority ofentities described in the grimoires, even if those beings’ only claim to fame or realitymay be the test of time.Rather than playing it safe, I would suggest that the people you describe are merelytime-wasting poseurs looking for another affectation to flesh out their dull middle-class lives along with dark clothing, body piercing and shishi coffee bars, rather thanparticipating in any discovery of ultimate reality, mystical experience , or even a pursuit"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"47of interest in an ancient practice of human society.

Hakim Bey recently wrote to me about the defamation of the Neolithic goddessTiamat as a chaos monster by supporters of the city god Marduk in the Enuma Elish,showing me something I had never quite appreciated about the Babylonian Genesis,the political propaganda inherent in it to the discerning eye. What is there to say aboutCthulhu, Nyarlathotep, Azathoth, and Yog-so-goth, apart from the fact that theyappeared in stories by H P Lovecraft, there is simply no hidden history to discover, nomysteries concealed by time, and, as you say, the version of this childish “mythos” belovedof role-playing-game fanatics is not even anything Lovecraft would have recognised, itis the product of corporate games manufacturers and misguided fantasists looking for acrutch to make themselves appear interesting who simply cannot be convinced that theNecronomicon isn’t real. What a waste of time that could otherwise be spent in genuinestudy of the occult. Such “occultists”—and, let’s face it, it’s not just kids, the Typhonianoto is full of them—don’t seem to be able to recognise the difference between mythologyand fantasy, having confused themselves with the belief they are experiencing atavisticresurgence from the sunken necropolis at R’lyeh.It is a mystery how this entirely false gnosis managed to take hold of so many minds.What knowledge can Cthulhu convey beyond pseudo-chaotic nihilistic self-satisfaction?Azathoth—an idiot savant deity. They have bought into a pop version of the occult,and are in bondage to an inanity—like adolescent Satanists worshipping the goat oftheir own rebellious youth, their heads spun into an illusion of Nyarlathotep’s hellishmoon glitter and ghastly midnight.The occult is a vast enough subject without people wasting their time on make-believe. Cthulhuites I notice tend to justify their endeavour by saying that all demonsand gods are make-believe.

In a thousand years time maybe there will be a civilizationthat has pledged its all in Lovecraft’s deities, that perhaps has colonized planets in thename of Cthulhu, and if so then that would warrant an occultist’s attention, no doubtabout it. But I don’t think that will happen, I think the present interest in the Lovecraftmythos is a fad and fashion that will die out having no meaning or purpose, a tribute tonihilistic glitz and nothing more.Anton LaVey was interviewed in MF Magazine #3, a Heavy Metal/Pop Culturemag, it was his final interview, and was asked: “In your book, The Satanic Rituals, youinclude a ritual for Cthulhu—does this mean you find some truth in the stories of H PLovecraft?” LaVey answered: “H P Lovecraft has a place in Satanic literature becausehe innovated a style beyond that of Poe, Blackwood, James, etc. The fact that his storieshave had enough dramatic impact to establish a cult—without even trying—is reasonenough to recognize him as a sorcerer to be reckoned with.”Now that’s actually an interesting point, but really the sheer pathology of it is what’smost worth examining. LaVey himself exploited this pathology, I mean what drives aperson to dress up as Satan most of their adult life? Pity his poor daughter, “an otherwisecharming girl everso slightly fucked up by having Satan as a dad”, as Alan Moore onceput it to me.JOELThe mystery of the Steganographia: demoniccryptographySome thoughts coming out of correspondence on the decipherment by Jim Reeds ofBook III of Johannes Trithemius’s SteganographiaThe Steganographia, written in 1500 and published in 1606, is an intriguing work becauseit contains an almost an exact copy of parts of the Lemegeton, but the idea is that thiswas a blind for what was actually a book on cryptography. The implications are slightlymindboggling. So you’ve got a book that resembles the Lemegeton, the classic manual ofdemonic evocation, but it contains hidden cipher messages intended to show Trithemius’smethods of cryptography. But why choose to disguise it as a book on demonic evocation,particularly at a time of witch-hunts? Could the hidden ciphers in the Steganographia"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"49imply that other ostensibly occult texts are similarly enciphered? Many demonicincantations involve long strings of barbarous words I have often wondered about theorigin of—could they contain cipher messages, just as Trithemius placed numericalciphers, as Jim Reeds has shown, in what have the appearance of tables of astronomicaldata in Book III. It was thinking about this that gave me the idea of a Goetic evocationto gain the ability to read secret writings and discover all manner of hidden things, andit is telling that this is precisely a typical power that can be bestowed by certain Goeticdemons. And of course cryptography is a classic demonic art anyway. Much of JohnDee’s angelic invocations and endless repetitive details of occult workings are believedby some cryptologists not to be angelic invocations and magical writings at all, but theuse of occult as a convenient cover for Elizabethan espionage, with Dee as a spy reportingback on the affairs of the Bohemian court and suchlike. The discovery of ciphers in theSteganographia Book III seems to imply that occultists were wrong to regard Trithemiusas a magician. But is it as simple as that?JB[Ed’s note—See: Reeds, Jim. “Solved: The Ciphers in Book III of Trithemius’sSteganographia.” Cryptologia 22 (1998), pp 291–318. Shortly after Reeds announced hisdiscovery he found out that Thomas Ernst had already solved the cipher and publishedit as “Schwarzweiße Magie. Der Schlüssel zum dritten Buch der Steganographia desTrithemius’’ in Daphnis 25:1 (1996), also published as a book, which Reeds reviewed inCryptologia 23 (1999). The New York Times of April 14, 1998, covered the story of thetwo men breaking the code independently of one another. Books I and III are translatedin: Tait F, Upton C. The Steganographia of Johannes Trithemius. Edinburgh: MagnumOpus Hermetic Sourceworks, 1982. As an aside, the cipher used in the Golden Dawncipher manuscript is one originated by Trithemius in Polygraphiæ et Universelle EscritureCabalistique, Paris, 1561. Jim Reeds also figured out a complex hidden pattern in themagic tables of the Book of Soyga, a copy of which was owned by John Dee.]Joel—Trithemius is a fascinating enigma. The fact is that Steganographia almost destroyedhis reputation as a theologian and as a witch hunter (Trithemius was strongly opposedto any kind of “demonic magic”), so to disguise a treatise of cryptography as a manualof magic would make no sense in the context of the times. More importantly, Trithemiusseemed to think that Steganographia would give the reader “instantaneous universalknowledge”, à la ars notaria; at least he says so in a letter to his friend Arnold Bostius.And if Steganographia was a kind of “hoax”, wouldn’t he have told Cornelius Agrippa?"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"50But on the other hand, we cannot ignore the recent deciphering of the third book.Here are my two cents (an idea which has no real value until I read myself theSteganographia, but the only transcription I know is on Joseph Peterson’s website, andmedieval Latin is too much for my stomach!): Steganographia is a “pure” manual ofcryptography, but Trithemius saw cryptography as a sacred science, not only a collectionof tricks: encoding a document became in itself a magical operation, which has thereforeto be placed under the invocation of spiritual forces, or “angels”. This seems to me to bequite in the spirit of Renaissance magic, which did not draw strong borders between“profane” and “magical” activities. There is, for instance, a magician (I don’t rememberwho, perhaps Camillo or Paolini, probably somebody of this circle) who tried to applythe concepts of alchemy to rhetoric. This would give a new vision of magical activity,which, not being confined to the limits of the magic circle, would become a way towork on “profane” things with a “sacred” mindset.REMI certainly agree that the distinction between pure science and magic was blurred then,but if Trithemius was supposed to be strongly opposed to demonic magic why wouldhe make his work look like a manual of demonic magic? You’d have to be phenomenallyintelligent to think Steganographia wasn’t a demonic book, because that was preciselywhat it looked like, so if the book was only a manual of cryptography and had no magicalcontent why choose such a risky disguise? As you say, it is a strange enigma. There is ofcourse the concept in cryptography of a false decipherment to throw people off thetrail, where a bogus possible decipherment is deliberately placed, such that when peoplefind it they give up looking for some other decipherment that is hidden deeper in thetext. Jim Reeds is of course aware of such things.Trithemius does seem in private correspondence to have written of the work in occultterms, such as in his 1499 letter to Arnoldus Bostius where he mentions that theSteganographia contains, besides over a hundred kinds of secret writing, a method forcommunicating one’s thoughts by fire over a distance and other forms of telepathy. AndAgrippa of Nettesheim (1486–1535) wrote in De Occulta Philosophia, concerning amethod of conveying one’s thoughts to a person far away within 24 hours: “And I knowhow to do this and have often done it. Abbot Trithemius also knew how to do it andused to do it.” Agrippa stayed with Trithemius at his monastery and learnt from himfirsthand. I need to classify exactly which demons possess the ability to teach how toread secret writings and discover hidden things, there may be some clue there, but I willdo it in the Lemegeton, for I have a vague suspicion that the example of Trithemius"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"51could imply that other occult manuscripts, purely occult manuscripts—such as thosethat ended up as the Lemegeton—are potentially similarly enciphered but it is notgenerally realised.JOELMmm... I’m not a specialist, but I’m not sure it is possible that Trithemius could becommenting on the books of the Lemegeton, doesn’t Trithemius predate it?Joseph Peterson, in his online edition (http://www.esotericarchives.com/solomon/lemegeton.htm), writes that the Lemegeton is a 17th century book (although based onearlier texts). And the introduction mentions “the fraternity of Rosicrucians” makingthis text posterior to 1600, at least.When I read Peterson’s introduction, I was under the impression that, in fact, bothTrithemius and Johann Wier were two important sources for the Lemegeton (Trithemiusinspiring Theurgia Goetia and Ars Paulina, Wier being a source for the Goetia).REMI don’t think Peterson necessarily implies Trithemius inspired Theurgia Goetia and ArsPaulina, he simply points out similarities. Johann Wier’s (aka Wierus) Pseudomonarchiadæmonum, part of his 1563 De Præstigiis Dæmonum, corresponds closely to Goetia, thefirst part of the Lemegeton. Wier doesn’t have any demonic seals, and the demons areevoked by a simple conjuration, not the elaborate ritual found in the Lemegeton. Wiercould have based his work on a manuscript Goetia, rather than vice versa.Reginald Scot in his Discoverie of Witchcraft, 1584, mentions Ars Paulina, Ars Almadel,and Ars Notoria, the third, fourth, and fifth parts of the Lemegeton, respectively. Trithemiushimself mentioned the Ars Almadel.Theurgia Goetia, the second part of the Lemegeton, has similar spirits and sigils toSteganographia Book I. The question is which came first. Trithemius’s conjurations areactually his examples of hidden writing (ie, steganography), and do not correspondwith the conjurations found in Theurgia Goetia, and although only a few of the demonicseals appear in Steganographia, these correspond exactly. This would seem to suggestthat Steganographia Book I was based on Theurgia Goetia, not the other way around.Steganographia was written in 1500, but was not published until 1606. It was, however,widely circulated in manuscript form. John Dee (1527–1608), for instance, had theSteganographia and mentioned commissioning another manuscript copy of it in a letterdated February 16, 1563. Dee described it as: “a boke for which many a lerned man"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"52hath long sought and dayly yet doth seeke.” Since we don’t know how long the fiveparts of the Lemegeton circulated in manuscript it seems reasonable to assume thatTrithemius based Steganographia on occult manuscripts already in circulation that laterbecame the Lemegeton in the 17th century. Trithemius (1462–1516) was a Benedictineabbot who visited many monasteries collecting manuscripts, so he was certainly in aposition to know about such works. His famous collection consisted of 2000 books, 800of them manuscript, in Latin, Greek, Hebrew, and other languages.My suspicion is that Trithemius used manuscripts that already existed. The spirits inPart 1 of the Ars Paulina (third part of the Lemegeton) coincide exactly with those foundin Trithemius’s Steganographia, Book II, but I don’t think this necessarily implies theArs Paulina was based on Steganographia, because why would Reginald Scot in 1584refer to the Ars Paulina rather than a manuscript of Trithemius? It would mean that theArs Paulina had sprung into existence as a plagiarism of Steganographia in a matter ofdecades without anyone realising. It seems to me more reasonable to assume Ars Paulinaalready circulated in manuscript pre-1500 and Trithemius came across it and decided itsuited his purposes to illustrate his theory of cryptography.The real question then becomes: why use occult manuscripts to illustrate methodsof cryptography if the manuscript did not also have an occult purpose? The mysteryremains. Jim Reeds wonders whether Trithemius regarded cryptography as inherentlymagical, but overall suggests that he could have embraced the rhetoric of magic toillustrate his cryptographic techniques as a strategy to engage the reader’s interest throughexample after example of tedious explanations. But the point is, if the reader is readingthe text as a cryptography handbook, and not as occult text, and is aware that it is incode and is not really an occult text, then I cannot see that the book would appear anymore interesting than it would if disguised as, say, a treatise on botany or geography.In Steganographia Book III Reeds found what he regarded as a figurative clue to thepossibility of a reversed alphabet in a simple reference to the “retrograde” motion ofSaturn. But I reckon that was not necessarily a deliberately placed clue but a luckyguess on his part inspired by the word. If it was a deliberate hint, then what are we tomake of the fact that of the 72 demons listed in the Goetia the powers of 12 of theminclude the ability to discover secret or hidden things: Vassago (3), Marbas (5), Barbatos(8), Paimon (9), Eligor (15), Purson (20), Shax (44), Vine (45), Procel (49), Gemory(56), Valac (62), Cimeries (66). From this one might suppose that cryptography is indeeda demonic art. This has made me wonder whether Trithemius was so interested inoccult manuscripts because, as a cryptographer, he had suspected or discovered theywere written in code. It’s only a speculation, but if this is so it is something that presentlygoes unrecognised by cryptologists."},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"53Although it has been thought that the decipherment by Jim Reeds of SteganographiaBook III—thus showing it is a book of cryptography and not the occult treatise itpurports to be—must necessarily downgrade Trithemius’s position in the history ofearly modern magic, personally I don’t think it’s as clearcut as that. Trithemius wasundeniably a great cryptographer, but he also had a fascination for occult manuscriptsand wrote about his own work in private correspondence in such a way as to show thathe believed it was not simply a work of cryptography but contained methods of magic.The book’s professed purpose is to show how to use spirits to send secret messages overdistances. I wonder whether, therefore, there may be some deeper level of ciphercontained in his work that has something to say on the occult, and that the deciphermentthus far discovered was deliberately placed to absolve him of charges of witchcraft shouldit have become necessary to reveal the book’s supposed “key” and thus prove it a work ofcryptography and nothing else.The reputation of Trithemius as an occultist was established after the alchemistCharles de Bouelles described a visit to Trithemius in 1504 during which he saw theSteganographia. Bouelles asserted in a letter that was published in 1510 that Trithemiusmust have consorted with demons and that the book should be burned. TheSteganographia was not published until 1606, in Frankfurt, when it appeared with anotherwork from the same publisher in the same year called Clavis Steganographiæ IoannisTrithemii Abbatis Spanheimensis, presumably written by Trithemius or one of his disciples,which explained quite straightforwardly how the ciphers of Books I and II worked, butit did not discuss Book III. The Clavis revealed that the demonic incantations wereactually encrypted instructions for concealing a secret message. Nonetheless, theSteganographia was placed in the Index Librorum Prohibitorum in 1609. Shortly thereaftervarious works of cryptography appeared seeking to vindicate Trithemius by explainingthe cryptographic principles of the Steganographia and thereby acquit its author of thecharge of consorting with infernal spirits. So this illustrates that a reasonable defenceagainst an accusation of diabolism was to show a book could be deciphered into ordinaryplain text, and that the purpose of the book was of an entirely different order. I suggestthat the decipherment of Book III does nothing to diminish Trithemius’s reputation asan occultist, it has merely brought to light a defence Trithemius could have used toacquit himself of charges of black magic. The mystery of Trithemius’s ultimate purposeappears far from solved. And as for cryptographic structure in the Book of Soyga and inEnochian, one must suppose that what has been discovered thus far was placed there bythe spirits themselves, turning back to the idea of early apparently magical cryptographyas a kind of proof of the genuineness of spirit communication, rather than it being thedeliberate placement of Kabbalistically inspired early cryptologists."},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"54The last word on the intent of Trithemius must belong to the man himself, who inhis introduction to Book III clearly appeals to the magician as his natural reader, and itdoes not sound to me he was merely creating a blind for a book that was a manual ofcryptography and nothing more:This I did that to men of learning and men deeply engaged in the study of magic, itmight, by the Grace of God, be in some degree intelligible, while on the other hand, tothe thick-skinned turnip-eater (imperitis Rapophagis) it might for all time remain a hiddensecret, and be to their dull intellects a sealed book forever.JOEL BIROCOThe necessity for secrecy in magickJoel—You have written that magick and occult workings should be done in absolutesecrecy, that no-one should be told in advance of one’s intention. A simple questionfrom a beginner—Why?TODDSimple questions are both the best sorts of questions to ask and the hardest ones toanswer. This I cannot answer in anything like a satisfactory way, it goes into the wholesubject of the importance of secrecy in magick and knowing when to remain silent.Suffice it to say in 20 years of practising magick in the early days I bought into the ideaof secrecy as being important so as not to “dilute” or “taint” what I was doing. Of course,in the early days I just accepted this as reasonable and never sought to “update” myviews on it in such a way as to be able to provide an explanation to someone such asyourself to keep in line with how my other views on magick evolved and grew, so I amleft clutching onto what may seem like a superstition without any intelligent way toexplain the whys and wherefores of it, because they are grounded in experience. But Ido know that on the one occasion when I did make the mistake of speaking of magickI planned to do I had to abandon that working because I felt it had become tainted. Butit is more than a superstition. We all know of the classic example of a “native” thinkinga camera can steal his soul by taking a picture of him. And I expect when you wereyounger, like me, you might have laughed at that native for being “uncivilised” or"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"55something, not as sophisticated as us westerners. But, perhaps, as you gradually learntmore about shamanism you might have come to understand, as I have, that it is notsimply a matter of superstition but that it goes to the very roots of, in this case, what isknown as “sympathetic magic”.I remember many years ago visiting the “Witchcraft Market” (Mercado de los Brujos)in La Paz, Bolivia. A trail of American tourists were walking down this amazing streetof stalls casually taking flash photographs with those disposable cubic flashes, whichthe tourists threw on the floor when used. But what none of them noticed was that thestoreholders were collecting up these disposed-of flashcubes and selling them on theirstalls for use in magical rites, along with other curious wares such as pretty pill-likeobjects and dried llama fetuses. Now, I thought to myself, on witnessing this and as amagician, what would I feel about having my disposed-of flashcube utilised in a Bolivianact of sorcery, and is this similar to the natives’ belief that a camera can steal the soul?This, in a roundabout way perhaps, is me saying it’s hard to explain to you the necessityof secrecy in magick, and the importance of not speaking about magick you intend todo, but that it’s more than a superstition that can be dispensed with lightly.People simply shouldn’t know about what magick you intend to perform, because ifthey do know your sacred act is leaking away into chattering profane triviality evenbefore it has been started. It is like trying to take a solemn oath in an atmosphere offrivolity, it loses its significance, you feel like you’re pretending and you have one eye onwhat you’re doing and the other on how it is perceived by outsiders to whom thesolemnity of your act is absurd, and you try to balance the two and lose sight of theproper respect you should be according your oath and as a consequence it becomes anempty oath and years later it will just be a habit one has forgotten the meaning andpurpose of and have doubtless broken anyway. Similarly, it is hard to perform successfulmagick if you have announced your intentions to others, they don’t need to be physicallypresent to have their eyes on you every step of the way. Had you kept it completelysecret you wouldn’t encounter this problem.JOELJoel—For a man who felt he couldn’t give a good answer, I feel you did a pretty goodjob.Anyone who has had a secret, one that they just couldn’t tell anyone, should at leastfeel the need for secrecy. Having such a secret creates a nearly unbearable sense of tension,and the self-possession required to keep such a secret is great.The tension represents “energy”, or “power”, that must be channelled into the Work,"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"56and not simply allowed to dissipate in casual conversation. That element of the personalitythat has a need to tell all it knows is motivated by a need for acceptance by and interactionwith others. It is in no way a part of the motivation to do the Work, and for the sake of“one-pointedness” is not to be indulged.The benefits of “self-possession” should be obvious.SATYRCompressing ritual workingsThere is so much work, even within the better curriculums, which is more than just theritual. I think that we get to a point where the ritual is almost a given. A friend of mineonce pointed out that there comes a point where you no longer draw the pentagramsbut simply “pump” them, which is to say that they appear when you call the Nameassociated with them. The reason the acolyte practices the rituals over and over is sothat later on he can do the entire thing in his head in a matter of seconds. What used totake hours to achieve (lbrp, lbrh, lirp, lirh [lesser banishing and invoking rituals ofpentagram and hexagram—Ed], Watchtower, 5=6 opening etc... or whatever yourparticular setup is) is done in a matter of minutes by evoking the situation, emotion andenergies which become familiar during the years of practice. In those who have beenworking with this for a very long time, it may even be unconscious and can be interpretedas “that familiar feeling of having prepared the temple” when you think about doingwork. The Guardian at the temple asked “Why do you seek to know?” and for those ofus who remember the answer, the work can seem very clear.It is interesting because as I wrote the first paragraph I began thinking of the ChaosMagickque material I’ve read concerning the “Deconstruction of Ritual” and I thinkperhaps this is what the fellow was referring to, not the discarding of ritual, but theability of the “experienced” magician to “compress” the working into a smaller timeframethrough experience and familiarity. Too bad the newbies cannot grok this. Well at leastit filters out the nuts before they get any real power, or worse, opens up their own mindsand they have to deal with the stuff inside.Sub Umbra Alarum Tuarum DeiGREG WOTTON"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"57Yes, that’s true about compressing workings. But it’s also about understanding whatyou are actually doing when you ritualize rather than simply using elements just becausethey’ve been used before. I have done lbrp just once in my life, I immediately realisedthat it was not at all necessary (for me), yet someone like the late Gerald Suster consideredthat if you didn’t do the lbrp practically every day you were no occultist. ManyThelemites living in the past believe the same. Such that for them it becomes theequivalent of occult aerobics with no meaning or purpose, just a slavish devotion totechnique without understanding.When Austin Spare ridiculed ritual and ceremonial magicians in The Book of Pleasureit was this kind of falsity and “dressing up” but not knowing why that he was actuallyseeking to discard. To someone who knows what they are doing a simple mudra ormovement of the hand or posture will accomplish what a beginner might seek to achieve(but may not actually achieve) by following a ridiculous Watchtower ritual stepwiselike a recipe from an Israel Regardie book. The essence of true magick is confidentextemporisation and the ability to scale spontaneity in “dynamic moves”. This comesnot only from years of practice but also from understanding of the forces one is dealingwith—it is not simply compression of a working but transcendence of its merelymechanistic aspects.Many ceremonial magicians have a habit of ceremony they cannot see beyond and asa result their workings are depleted of actual magick. To me, chaos magick was aboutgoing beyond this, but as you realise there are few who associate themselves with chaosmagick who understand anything of its deeper principles. Most “chaos magicians” latchedonto chaos magick as a way to avoid training and hierarchy, but ended up in a non-progressive state because they hadn’t realised that chaos magick is actually an advanceon traditional magick, not simply another choice of system, but for it to be an advancepractically it actually demands far more of you than traditional magick. That was theerror they made and they show little sign of being able to recover from it.I spent a good deal of time in the 80s pointing this out to them here in KAOS, anddo so again now because the resurgence of the true Chaos current onto the Outer againis imminent after 12 years of apparently being in the doldrums. Chaos magick hasalways attracted more than its fair share of complete no-hopers, and I have likened thisto a kind of disguise and necessary façade, the attracting beacon of the massing crowdthrough which those more serious about their occult work may weave their way to thecentre and discover there some totally unexpected real occultists. There are people whounderstand the principles of magick as I expound them, but they will always be the few.JOEL"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"58A discussion on juxtapositional magickHH: So grand poobah, how do you do it then? What’s the big secret?Joel Biroco: Juxtapositional magick. But essentially we’re talking about things that areexperiential. I gave up trying to explain my own experience as a substitute for otherpeople’s lack of experience. Don’t ask me to explain it, if you want to know what it iscast a sigil—and jack off on it if you must—to understand juxtapositional magick, andthen maybe one day you will and you might thank me for taking the scales off youreyes.BPS: Hey, I was wondering if you could go into more depth. I’ve still got a LOT tolearn, but this sounds interesting.Joel Biroco: It is beyond words, but if you think about what the term “juxtapositionalmagick” might mean, and indeed cast a sigil to understand it (as simple as that), you willbegin to glimpse things that come under the heading of juxtapositional magick. But fornow: take a moment to study your room wherever you are reading this and take in thejuxtapositions that are already present. Make connections, join up things, visualize acollection of objects as a one object, loosen the boundaries of objects. Notice your worldand its juxtapositions. Juxtapositional magick is not something one learns overnight, itis a lifetime’s work, you must realise I can’t explain that to you, you must see it with yourown eyes. Don’t seek explanations, seek juxtapositions and study the natural placementof objects in the world. The act of noticing should be a daily task until it becomesnatural, even if you have no idea what the juxtapositions mean all you have to do isnotice them. Understanding comes later. Then you can learn to manipulate juxtapositionsand learn to be a juxtapositional magician. Make a juxtapositional altar, which is onethat grows spontaneously over time without thought and is only one day noticed assuch. If you already have aptitude for this art then you will see that you have alreadyformed a juxtapositional magick altar without even realising it. Any conscious effort tocreate such an altar will only destroy the possibility of producing it, so if you feel theurge to create one and can’t see that you have one simply forget about creating one andconcentrate on noticing juxtapositions, then in time you will see where you have createdyour juxtapositional altar. This is the essence of the power of juxtapositional magick, itgives method to spontaneity."},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"59HH: Holy shit, that is one of the best things I have ever seen you type up, vague becauseof the nature of it, but informing... damn... that’s deep... I mean really.David Cantu: Thanks Joel, this makes sense. I guess you would have brought pattern inif you had meant to, so slap me for mentioning it.Joel Biroco: Juxtapositional magick is my own formulation derived from many differentsystems of magick over many years, and certainly the Chinese concept of li or “pattern”feeds into that, but to mention such advanced concepts to a self-proclaimed beginnerwould be out of place, so I simply provided a sketch to get him going. A brief descriptioncouldn’t possibly exhaust juxtapositional magick.David Cantu: Please correct what you see wrong in this view, but the rearrangement ofknowledge into symbolic systems like the Tree of Life lead magicians to see juxtapositionsbetween elements in new ways. I know that this isn’t what you mean in the presentpractice, but it could go to the heart of why such symbolically connective systems work.Any comments on that Joel?Joel Biroco: Yes, and the art of “correspondences” is also equally as important in bagua,but although these methods do certainly relate to what I refer to as juxtapositionalmagick what I am really talking about here is something far more “second-nature” andtuned-in, real moving with spontaneity without thought. Study of trigram and qabalisticcorrespondences can lead to this, but in itself it lacks the sheer elegance of truejuxtapositional magick, which operates in the sense of wuwei (“not doing”, doing nothing,no effort, no purposeful action). I am talking about something far more direct thangoing via a symbolic filter of correspondences or resonances, or any kind of symbolicframework. In this sense, by juxtapositional magick I really mean pure magick.Mika Kaplan: It seems like using a symbolic filter of correspondences would be a good“first step” then. One approach to the qabala (and I think Crowley discusses thissomewhere...?) is that you relate everything to the Tree of Life, everything, from thegrocery bill to the color car in front of you at the stop light, to the snippet of conversationyou hear passing people in the street, etc... to the point that the connections becomesubconscious. Or maybe the correct word is unconscious. The need for the symbolicframework disappears and there is no effort involved in seeing, knowing, understandinghow it all comes together."},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"60Joel Biroco: It’s not about having a pinboard. It’s not about making a symbolic frameworkunconscious, it is about making a symbolic framework unnecessary. Correspondencesare arbitrary associations, they don’t “mean” anything except what you allow them tomean. We also each have our personal correspondences funded from memory andassociations made in the past. Though it may not seem like it, even these connectionsare arbitrary; they may appear “meaningful” and we may use them to feather our nest ofbelongingness in the universe, but this is complete illusion. We hear magicians speakof, oh, I dunno, green for Venus, whatever, gold for Kings, whatever, all of it is completelyarbitrary and meaningless. We invest in these associations because people always have.If I’m saying anything here it is that juxtapositional magick cuts free from all of thisand so I categorically state: studying qabala, bagua, correspondences, whatever, is of nouse for learning juxtapositional magick: no use whatsoever, in fact, it’s a hindrance. Butwe will continue to hinder ourselves and our magick because that’s the way we are.Juxtapositional magick is not about taking on board “ways to learn it” it’s about unlearningall of what we have taken for granted so far.David Cantu: A similar notion is touched on in Liber Null & Psychonaut when Carrolltouches on coincidence, and its importance—I read this more as patterns in reality,because “coincidence” occurs on all sorts of levels.Joel Biroco: I’m not talking about synchronicity but spontaneous ritual.David Cantu: Is it safe to assume that juxtapositional casting involves using patternswhich basically assemble themselves?Joel Biroco: Er... sort of... but don’t try to define this too soon...David Cantu: Why, then, is an altar relevant?Joel Biroco: It is a place of focus, a place of power, but altars can be found anywhere, thiswas my point.David Cantu: Say, for example, I notice a “physical coincidence” between a bass guitar,a stereo, and a grapefruit. This “unified object” (ie, I remove perceptual boundariesbetween these objects) relates to a particular unwanted emotion, or desired effect.How then does one make the leap between seeing and doing, or is there a leap at all?"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"61Joel Biroco: No leap because no thought, just spontaneous action directed by insight.But to try to address your comment in as helpful a way as is possible, I wonder if you areone leap ahead of yourself. You are wondering how to make the leap from seeing todoing, but I wonder whether you have really made the leap between bass, stereo,grapefruit and an unwanted emotion, or whether you are positing an examplehypothetically. Hypothetical situations are the antithesis of juxtapositional magick. Thereis no point in saying “What if...” Learn from spontaneity itself, from the moment itself,in real time. You cannot second-guess juxtapositional magick or have pre-preparedresponses. It is ritual, but not ritual “as we know it Jim”. So avoid thinking about it andtrying to answer hypothetical questions about it. You can’t come to an understanding ofit that way.As for feeling like a beginner... Remember that your understanding of this nextweek, next year, in five years time, in 10 years time, in 20 years time, will advance. Alsobe aware that there are many magicians who have been studying and practising moredocumented forms of magick for many years who know next to nothing of juxtapositionalmagick, to whom these ideas will be new. There are no books on this and this is the firsttime I have even mentioned juxtapositional magick in a public forum myself, though Ihave been practising this form of magick for many years. “Juxtapositional magick” isonly a name I came up with for convenience, that kinda describes it, but it’s the doing ofit that’s important, description fails dismally to convey the real power of this magick,which is why I’ve never attempted to write about it, it was only because I was pressedthat I am doing so now. I first evolved this form of magick in experiments with Goeticevocation in the 1980s, and, just thinking about it now actually—because I really don’tthink about it much at all, I just do it—perhaps I was taught it by a demon... hmmm,food for thought. And, if so, it would have been on the one occasion when I “made amistake” and permitted a demon to possess me, and, while possessed, carried out a formof magick I had never seen before. I watched myself do it, taking it all in. This is likepersonal revelations in real time! I’m laughing to myself, because the more I thinkabout it the more I think that is indeed where I learnt how to do this, and yet, that’s thefirst time I’ve had that realisation. Up until this moment I had believed it was somethingthat I “kinda evolved”, but no, initially I was shown it by a demon and then I developedit. Well I’ll be!David Cantu: You will probably disagree with this first part but read the whole thing.This all seems important, and the idea that other patterned forms of magick may havea root in this is interesting to me, because it gives power back to the creation of systemsrather than the systems themselves, which you point out, are arbitrary. Please note the"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"62following though. For rank beginners, the juxtaposition of ideas according to a setpattern like Kabbalah is a tool for seeing connections in the world that were, previously,invisible. Now, I am not touting any one system or systems in general, only pointing outthat new ways of thinking arise from rearrangements of connected symbols (whetherthey be ideas or physical objects existing in space).For me juxtapositional magick is how I create music. The compositional control isloosened so that the Universe can create through me. Each instrument is more or lesschannelled, and interactions, mostly “accidental”, occur that Could Not Be WrittenOut. No compositional system can hold them, or spew them out, because each systemis based on arbitrary restrictions which keep things from happening. In fact, it has beenmy staunch refusal to learn a musical theory that has allowed me to explore in realmsno music theory can touch, so from that point of view, the system becomes a hindranceto the manifestation of willed forms. All things that come out of these systems willalways be an extension of the relationships in the given system and will miss the multitudeof relationships not covered by the system. The results, for me, are always more real if Iabandon system constraints and just do.Joel, you may not relate to this music analogy, but you do a type of visual art which,I bet, bears relation to this type of magick.Joel Biroco: Oh absolutely, and I was discussing this very point with some artist friendsonly last night and gave a kind of spontaneous lecture on the relation betweenjuxtapositional magick and the creation of art. The essential difference is that in magickthere is a purpose in the creation of an object beyond aesthetics, in juxtapositionalmagick the creation of an object is the means not the end. I suspect artists may graspthe actual “doing” of juxtapositional magick more than many occultists, but not graspthe magical side of what they are doing and not know how to use that for specificmagical ends. I have seen this many times in the artists’ group to which I belong andoften wish that occultists had this kind of talent for what is really magick, particularlyin performance art, quite a few of the members including myself having an interest inperformance art. One girl astonishes me every time with the sheer originality of hercreated objects (cutting open an apple, staining the inside with red food dye and placinga pomegranate in the cored-out centre, and stapling it back together like a Frankensteinapple which she opens up to show us, all of her objects she opens up layer by layer toshow us, or she might bake silver foil spiders in Cornish pasty cases, or place a lightbulband sunflower seeds inside a hollowed-out loaf, stoppering it with a bread brain, andher use of mold, and hair, and other found materials) and I have had conversations withher about how I identify her manner of creation of art objects as being similar to my"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"63own approach to the creation of magical objects and the strange spontaneous processesI subject them to before they are finished, which makes use of what is to hand, and,more to the point, what is to hand is always exactly what is needed if you’re in thejuxtapositional-magick way of looking. The astonishing ideas one has that are simply“perfect” to create the desired magical effect, I use a lot of burning, for instance, andscorching, and soot-wafting from flames, and wood-cutting, and rubbing in of aloeswood ash, and beeswax, and use of pigments such as pyrrole red and of course blood,my own blood, and semen, and the milky sap of dandelion stems, or perhaps a mothmay stray near the lamp I am working under and briefly coat the back of my hand witha touch of mothwing dust, what a find in the middle of an act of juxtapositional magick!What does that represent?! Bloody obvious! Use it! Sudden thought, are the lilacs inbloom yet, should it smell of lilacs, well let’s see if they’re in bloom and out I rush intothe garden in the mad frenzy of juxtapositional magick, no they’re not, they’re not, butlook at the way that centipede is moving on the stones, good god it’s drawing a sigil,draw that sigil NOW! Draw it on the object in your own blood, slash your palm with ablade and draw out blood and do it now and I’m commanded so I do it! And so it goeson. THIS is juxtapositional magick! And so when I tell her like this about some of thejuxtapositional magical objects I have created and the way I have created them shewonders why I never bring any of this kind of “art” along to the group, just my paintings,and of course I say: “Er, well, because that’s magick, that’s not art...”This is not to say that juxtapositional magick is simply about the creation of magicalobjects, more it is about the way they are created.Pansamsara: I’m so so glad that you have written all of this stuff. I feel like you havehanded back to me something I chucked out because I was scared that I was “loosingit”. What you call “juxtapositional magick” was what I initially thought “chaos magick”was about—directly working my own meanings. Then I just got confused by readingtoo much chaos literature (never quite got over the intellectualism of it all). I used to bean artist of sorts when I left school and so am familiar with frenzied moments of creation.It was stupid to try and strait-jacket those abilities like I seem to have done.

Well timed, thanks again."},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"64Out-of-body experienceJoel—You stress that astral travel and out-of-body experience (oobe) are very different.Care to expand? I thought they were the same.TANSYDifference between oobe and astral travel is that with astral travel you don’t get thefrizzling crackling hissing popping electrical static horribly serious ripped from bodysound that seems to accompany sleep paralysis one awakens too early from, becauseastral travel is imagination from within the body (not to say you can’t “see” real things)and a dream state but oobe is more like a crash-entry to the bardo plane.For years I came across no mention of this very distinctive and truly appalling soundin reports, then I met a person who described exactly what I had heard and it was atthat time that I distinguished in my own mind the difference between oobe and astraltravel. Since then I have come across a few other people who have heard this sound,such that I now regard it as the mark of the true oobe. I tend to think if you haven’theard this sound but think you have had an oobe you are more likely to be talkingabout lucid astral travel but were not actually outside of the body, although I wouldn’twant to be dogmatic over that point. I regard oobe of this character as a dangerous areato experiment with and feel they are best left for those spontaneous occasions whenthey may occur, which is not a pleasant experience, even speaking as one who has goneout of his way to experience unusual states, this I class as an area I want nothing to dowith. The term oobe I classify as describing a “bad” body exit, almost as if one has tornsome delicate dimensional membrane that should not be torn.So I tend to think anyone who talks of oobe lightly is simply confusing it with astraltravel, genuine oobe is a traumatic experience, like finding yourself wounded on adimensional plane beyond all human help, you cannot call for help to human society,they cannot hear you. It is utterly horrifying, with that terrible sound to keep youcompany, your body paralysed and you unable to animate it in any sense, you may aswell be dead you cannot wake yourself from this by will alone. That is the reality ofoobe. Astral travel, by contrast, is on a par with dreaming.That said, in my experience you can get into an oobe reality from dream/sleep paralysiswithout going through the horrible pinging crackling popping sound.

A much better transitional state than going through the crackling pingingpopping sound, though it too does have a freaky aspect.

In this case, Kenneth Grant’sTyphonian oto, since unto themselves they are the oto and the existence of any otheroto—about ten at the last count, although the Caliphate oto is the only other oneworth mentioning—remains largely unacknowledged. The grandiloquent statement—“Issued by the Sovereign Sanctuary of the Gnosis of the Ordo Templi Orientis this 21stday of June 1998 e.v.”—to my mind read like a reorientation document towards firmThelemic principles lest anyone think the Typhonian oto had completely gone off therails since plunging beyond the Mauve Zone after three decade’s worth of opening upof extraterrestrial gateways through which little came but oceans of purple prose, whichI concede was utterly fascinating. My eyes were therefore wide with amazement as Iread the Official Statement, I had to sit down on a footstool in Watkins bookshop itsheady aroma stirring romantic visions of occult world domination, and I decided in theend this is an issue I simply must buy for the Official Statement alone.Grant, who is of course acutely aware of the chaos that awaits his demise within hisbeloved Typhonian oto, began his statement innocently enough after the obligatorywilting Law:It has been considered desirable to remind prospective candidates for membership—andeven some members—that ‘creative occultism’ is not, per se, the final aim of our magick,but merely its mode of operation. The present statement is therefore intended as a briefand summary blueprint of the ultimate aim of our Order. [p 11]"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"68Oh dear, our Ken sounds worried. Will it all be lost no sooner than his ashes are swirlinginto the wild mauve yonder? They’ve had their brief holiday in the sun flirting withCthulhu, trekking intrepidly down those nightside tunnels, ransacking the world’sesoteric traditions for better words for “sperm”, and now they must come home toAleister Crowley’s stark Thelemic Law lest they be considered by the occult historiansof the future as mere heretics on a joyride and fail the Master Therion. How it mustgrate on Grant. For the ultimate aim of his Order is none other than exactly the same asthe ultimate aim of those damned Caliphates that he—the true heir of Crowley—hasbrushed off for years as mosquitoes biting an iron bull. So it must have been a source ofsome amusement to him when the dastardly Herr Koenig published on the Internet(http://www.cyberlink.ch/~koenig/doc.htm) a letter supposedly written by Crowleydated November 18/19 1947 that “unexpectedly” turned up from nowhere, with noprovenance presented, that ratifies Kenneth Grant in the guise of “Frater Aussik 400”as the legitimate successor of Crowley as Outer Head of the Ordo Templi Orientis.According to Starfire, Grant did not know about the letter, though it does “confirm acasual remark made to him at Crowley’s funeral by Lady Frieda Harris concerningCrowley’s last minute change of mind with regard to his successor as oho of the oto”.In typical mystery style Grant notes:The document has only just now come to light, unnecessarily, as time will reveal. Willtime also reveal who discovered it, where, and why it remained concealed for more thanhalf a century? [“An Instrument of Succession”, Starfire, Vol. II, No. 2, p 173]Ben Fernee, proprietor of Caduceus Books and former VII° Grand InquisitorCommander in the Caliphate oto until he was expelled in 1999 after being accused bythe Supreme Council of selling the Order’s secrets—which he denied strenuously—commissioned a forensic handwriting analyst when the Grant succession letter appearedon the Internet at the end of March, 1998. The analyst, who regularly testifies in courtas an expert witness in forgery cases, was 85% certain after detailed comparison withgenuine samples of Aleister Crowley’s handwriting that the succession letter was writtenby someone other than Crowley trying to impersonate his hand. One theory doing therounds is that the letter may be an old forgery, made with Crowley’s actual notepaperand seal ring for the red wax impression, and if that is the case the most likely suspectwould be Lady Frieda Harris, who hated Karl Germer. In 1955 Germer proved to bethe doom of Grant’s official succession when he expelled him from the oto, a decisionthe Typhonian oto stress that Germer was not in a position to make, pointing todocumentation where Germer admits to Grant that he is not the Outer Head of the"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"69Order but merely in a caretaker position. Yet it was Grant’s very acknowledgement ofGermer as “World Head of the oto in the Outer” in the manifesto of his New IsisLodge, stating that Germer was in accord with its contents, that was one of the thingsGermer took exception to seeing as he had been told nothing of it in advance. WhenGermer saw the manifesto he considered it full of “outright lies” and that Grant was“sailing under false pretences” and promptly gave him the boot. The interminable detailsof the various claims to succession by the various oto factions can be pored over onKoenig’s website and others. More interesting, concerning the recently discovered Grantsuccession letter, is that I am told that in private Grant had said, before the letter on theKoenig site came to light, that at Crowley’s funeral at Brighton Crematorium onDecember 5, 1947, Lady Frieda Harris mentioned to him that there was a letter makinghim head, although in Starfire this becomes an unspecified “casual remark”.Time has a lot of revealing to do it seems. After years of wisely remaining aloof fromthe issue of the legitimacy of his own succession, Kenneth Grant is suddenly forced bythe prospect of his own death—he’s now 78 (b. 1924)—to put the matter on the agendaonce again, and reorientate the Order towards Thelemic orthodoxy, lest anyone bemistaken enough to suppose that they had drifted towards crepuscular reclining uponthe divan of dark crystalline suzerainty mounted upon the iridescent winged beetlescreaming down the corridor of the Aeons following the putrescent squid ejected fromthe blowhole of Dendera under the sweet sweet black sun at midnight onto the shoresof Babalon’s pulsating and tumescent yoni. No! Apparently that’s not what the oto’sabout after all.So what is the ultimate aim of the oto, Typhonian and Caliphate alike? Well, this issomething regularly discussed around the fireside by Bill Breeze, the power-obsessedand autocratic Caliph of the Caliphate oto, but reading it from Grant, who I thoughtwas quite beyond mere terrestrial ambition, I have to confess I was wondering whetherCerberus was in sight for it reads well enough like a sop:Briefly, the plan comports the eventual dissolution of all existing terrestrial governments.For these governments will be substituted “kingdoms” administered by specially appointed“Kings” of oto, in the Tenth Degree. The Kingdoms will, in turn, be subject to a centralgovernment directed by a “Supreme and Most Holy King” who shall be the Outer Headof the Order.

Okay, that’s fair enough, exceptfor the Kings bit. And, I might add, are there no oto Queens in this cosmic vision?Terrestrial kingdoms controlled by the oto is all implied by Crowley’s Book of theLaw I suppose, but not having seen it spelled out as starkly as that for some years I hadforgotten how ludicrous the ultimate aim of the oto actually was. Now the interestingthing to me is that the Typhonian oto has never really been keen on this terrestrialkingship idea—hard to run a worldwide government of Holy Kings with 14 membersand the spare room at your disposal—and I can’t help wondering whether Grant hasstated it so clearly not so much to point out the ultimate aim of the Typhonian oto asthe Caliphate, because this really is all they are interested in. Or maybe Grant is serious,he’s put the “creative occultism” on the back boiler for a little while so he can re-establishhis Order’s credibility as a dynamic force that despite its lack of terrestrial lodges hasnot lost sight of the ultimate aim of the oto.Contrast the 1998 “Official Statement” with the 1977 “Official Statement” publishedin Mezla, the internal Typhonian oto newsletter:Readers should consider the fact that all books on Crowley that appeared prior to Grant’sTyphonian Trilogy reveal an almost total ignorance on the part of their authors as to thethree major concerns of the Book of the Law. We refer to: 1) the importance of extra-terrestrial influences and the necessity for establishing proper contact with them throughthe magick of the New Aeon; 2) the mode of their invocation by magical means; 3) thescience of the kalas (psycho-sexual emanations of fully-polarized male-female organisms)which lies at the heart of the Book of the Law and which is the substratum of all itsteachings and the key to the curious cyphers (literary and numerical) which abound inits pages. In point of fact, no books to this day—with the exception of Grant’s—treat ofthe most secret magick of the kalas and their use in the psycho-sexual mysteries of the 93Current.Nothing about “Kings of the oto”, still less of the heap, the emphasis is purely on the“creative current”—it’s all extraterrestrials and bodily liquid secretions supposedly referredto in the Book of the Law, the view that the oto is really all about the “secret” of the sex"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"71magick practised in its ninth degree. (Reading Kenneth Grant’s Aleister Crowley and theHidden God again after many years I must admit I had forgotten how blatant he hadbeen in revealing and concealing the secret of the 9th degree. I laughed though at hisstraight-faced suggestion that the “higher forms of cunnilinctus” were performed byvery advanced Tantric adepts without physical contact, the method being a closely guardedsecret. Maybe Grant is the ultimate piss-taker. As for his apparent belief that cunnilingusis a cough mixture, I might note that the true spelling is derived from the Latin: cunnus,“vulva”, lingere, “to lick” [although “linctus”, a syrup-like medicine, comes from theLatin linctus, “a licking”, so conceivably Grant could be alluding to the elixir].)The Typhonian oto has never been particularly terrestrial, its lodges are to be foundon the astral plane in such places as the winking eye of Algol. By contrast, the Caliphateoto is a terrestrial corporation fiercely protective of what it sees as its territory, and assuch legally hindered the distribution of Mr Grant’s book Hecate’s Fountain in the States(see Michael Staley’s essay “It’s An Ill Wind That Bloweth...” in Starfire Vol. 1, No. 5[1994]). The Caliphate forced Grant to insert a slip of paper in each copy stating thathe had been expelled from the oto in 1955 by Germer and that the Typhonian otohad no right to speak on behalf of the oto in the States. Grant wanted a right of replybut the Caliphate did not allow him to have one, and they also managed to get him toremove the oto lamen from the book jacket on the ground that it was their officialcorporate logo. While writing this essay I specifically asked Bill Heidrick, TreasurerGeneral and Ninth Degree Magus of the Caliphate oto, about whether he felt KennethGrant’s Typhonian oto had the right to educate and provide direction concerningThelema in the United States without legal interference from the Caliphate oto. Heresponded to me on the Internet newsgroup alt.magick, on June 5, 2001:It was a disclaimer that allowed ambiguity to be set aside in some of the remarks in hisbooks. The alternative would have been limitation of speech, something nobody wanted.This way he just included a removable notice that what he said didn’t come from or bindthe oto.Thus it is clear that had Grant not complied with their request the alternative of“limitation of speech” (a contravention of Crowley’s Liber Oz, incidentally) would havebeen applied by resort to the courts.The Caliphate oto was founded in 1977 by Grady McMurtry (1918–1985). PeterKoenig on his “oto phenomenon” website suggests that McMurtry took the title“Caliph”, which had never previously existed in the oto, simply because Crowley wroteto him in “Calif ”, the postal abbreviation for California. More seriously, Koenig also"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"72suggests that without Jean Brayton’s Solar Lodge the Caliphate oto may never havecome into existence at all (http://home.sunrise.ch/~prkoenig/manson.htm). The SolarLodge brought the oto into opposition with the fbi when they kept a six-year-old boychained in a hotbox in the Mojave desert for 56 days. The Washington Post for October31, 1969, carries the report: “Boy Tells of Chaining By Cultists”. Charles Manson,though not formally a member of the Solar Lodge, was a visitor and was invited to JeanBrayton’s parties. The complex story of the founding of the Caliphate oto, essentiallybased on historical revisionism, is dealt with in detail by Herr Koenig and on the webpagementioned above there is also an email discussion between Koenig and Heidrick onwhether the present-day Caliphate oto includes any members of the original SolarLodge who were involved in the “boy in a hotbox” scandal.The claim of the Caliphate oto to be the oto in the United States comes from acourt case in May 1985, in California. US Army Major Grady McMurtry of Berkeley,ca, the oho of the Caliphate oto, and “Society Ordo Templi Orientis” under MarcelloRamos Motta from Brazil got into a legal battle, initiated by McMurtry, over trademarkand copyright infringement but which turned into an unconstitutional ruling on whowas the actual chartered oto in the US (and thereby who controlled the copyright onCrowley’s work). McMurtry won and, bizarrely, died the very same day. Colonel MichaelAquino of US Military Intelligence, who left Anton LaVey’s Church of Satan to formthe Temple of Set, watched the legal battle, and wrote this wonderfully arch commentin the Scroll of Set Vol. XII, No. 5 (Oct 1986):While sitting in the courtroom watching Judge Legge preside sternly over the slug-out,I couldn’t help wondering if he had any idea he was ruling on which group had legalclaim to anal sex as the supreme religious sacrament in the United States.This is a reference to the 11th degree, which even today the oto is still coy about admittingwhether or not it is a “per vas nefundum” or “reversionist” rite. (The 11th degree or“Order of Shiraz” has now been disbanded in the Caliphate oto by Breeze, since itimplied power he felt undermined by.) But the essential point is that a terrestrialcourtroom had no jurisdiction to decide in favour of one oto grouping over anotherand the Caliphate oto has used this legal decision in their own favour ever since tobolster its territorial ambitions, utterly at odds with the Great Work. The transcript ofthe courtroom proceedings is well worth reading, topics ranging from the 9th degreesecret to the size of Mr Motta’s sexual organ.William Breeze (the “bastard linguistic mongrel” Hymenæus Beta) took over asCaliph when Grady McMurtry (Hymenæus Alpha) died in 1985, a fourth degreer who"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"73assumed the modest title “His Most Sacred Majesty”. Breeze, ironically, holds an A∴A∴lineage from Marcello Motta. The late Ellic Howe, the occult and masonic historian,met Breeze in 1987 and wrote: “I have no reason to believe that he [Breeze] is informedabout the early history of the oto or European affairs generally.” (Letter dated 7/10/87from Howe to Koenig.)In a 1987 essay in Starfire prompted by a flowchart published in Nuit-Isis magazinein the UK showing the Caliphate oto to be the legitimate heirs of Aleister Crowley(odd since the magazine’s publisher Chris “Mogg” Morgan aka Katon Shual was in theTyphonian oto), Michael Staley, defending the Typhonian oto’s claim to legitimacy,said a very wise thing:In essence, it seems a waste of time to have to argue about the past, when what reallymatters is the present task of developing Thelema and radiating the 93 Current. Somepeople and organisations seem to see Crowley, Thelema and the oto as glamorous museumpieces, fixed in perpetuity, to be preserved and cherished here and hereafter. Accordingto this notion, the structure of the Order is sacrosanct, bequeathed to us by the GreatMan himself. Thus they admit of no development, no innovation, no change. In short,Thelema becomes a cult of Crowley, and his personality a prime focus. Nothing could bemore laughable, more pitiable, than such a notion. It is surely a grotesque distortion ofThelema, and a negation of all that Crowley strove for. Things are in a constant state offlux and flow, unless they are dead. Of course if people hide from change, it is oftenbecause they are scared of the challenge of thinking afresh, of innovation.[“The oto After Crowley”, Starfire Vol. I, No. 2 (1987)]It remains to be seen whether Staley will feel the same about the extent of the innovationand fresh thinking represented by the kaos-babalon 156 current, which rendersThelema, 93 current, redundant. Another thing for time to reveal. In this respect, in“It’s An Ill Wind That Bloweth...”, Staley notes concerning the Caliphate oto:They must learn to accept their true status as one amongst several legitimate groupings;otherwise, the course of the current will surely and justly dissolve them as hindrances toits expression.Here is the essential point: it won’t be the 93 current that dissolves the Caliphate butthe 156 current. Time will reveal whether the 156 current will also dissolve the Typhonianoto, certainly it will if they are serious about their recent turn towards terrestrial kingship,but if “creative occultism” is their prime motivation then, who knows, they might eventune into kaos-babalon and the 156 current as being the true magical current. Michael"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"74Staley, despite his interest in such deadends as Lam, appears to understand this; in1994 he wrote that the oto is “an expression of an informing current, a current whichadopts one guise after another, moving on when a particular form has outlived itsusefulness”. One can only hope that he also realises that the greatest challenge facingthe oto today is not to set up a network of Kingdoms under the control of a Supremeand Most Holy King but simply to understand that the oto itself has outlived itsusefulness, and is hindering the expression of the 156 current by tying up occultists inthe dead 93 current.These realisations do not seem to come easy to most Thelemites, who appear to feelthreatened by the 156 current and do not recognise it as the living transmutation of the93 current. In practice what will probably happen is that the oto will continue as anorganisation that soaks up neophytes and binds their Wills to its forlorn agenda, butgradually the talented individuals who are presently wasting their time in it will cometo understand the implications of the 156 current, rise above their involvement in 93,and then either subvert the oto or simply resign to find or create formations moreconducive to the working of kaos-babalon.Related mattersKenneth Grant succession letterThe “Grant succession letter” was included in OTO Rituals and Sex Magick (Thame:Mandrake Press, 1999), edited by Tony Naylor with an introduction by Peter Koenig,which is curious given that Ben Fernee gave a copy of the forensic handwriting analysishe commissioned to Naylor before publication. He also gave a copy to Michael Staleybefore publication in Starfire. Neither mentioned it. One suspicious thing about theactual content of the letter is that in it “Crowley” says that Frater Saturnus (Karl Germer)is “capable only of the Office of Custodian” of the oto, which is something that MichaelStaley had written about at length prior to the letter turning up and is indeed thelynchpin of Grant’s claim that Germer had no legitimate authority to expel him. I amtold, however, that Staley was genuinely surprised when the “succession letter” turnedup on the Internet. Even so, the content of the letter does seem too pat with currentcircumstances to have been written in 1947.One theory is that the letter is a forgery that was not so much aimed at establishingGrant as oho of the oto but rather at pissing off Bill Breeze. Herr Koenig is known for"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"75his obsessive dislike of Breeze and the Caliphate, the letter did show up on his site, andthus far has not said how he obtained either the image he posted or the original letter.When I emailed him asking for further information all I got back was a rather unhelpfulresponse saying “if it is not on my website then it is not for release” followed by one ofthose stupid smiley faces.Another idea is that there was indeed such a letter, and Frieda Harris saw it but didnot have access to it, and so created a forgery. It might be interesting to compare herhandwriting with the supposed succession letter. Whether Grant has had possession ofthis letter all along and only recently decided to test the water with it anonymously isperhaps one of those things that time will reveal. The other alternative is that the letteris perfectly genuine, and Crowley in his last days did in fact make Grant oho. For allthe criticism Grant receives for “perverting” Thelema and “polluting” it with Lovecraftmythos occultism, he has at least spent the time since Crowley’s death engaged inmagical exploration, which is more than can be said for the Caliphate oto. [See AlanMoore’s article “Beyond our Ken” in the Review section for a fond appreciation ofKenneth Grant’s contribution to the world of occultism—Ed]Ben Fernee, the Caliphate OTO, and the “BlackMagus of Manchester” affairBen Fernee made public his expulsion from the Caliphate oto in the spring of 1999 forsupposedly selling the Order’s secrets. Fernee, as a secondhand book dealer specialisingin occult books, had put together a book list announcing a number of rare Crowleyitems from a private collection. Three items were singled out for special attention byBill Heidrick and Soror Helena of the Caliphate Supreme Council: a handwrittenvariant by Crowley of De Natura Deorum (a secret sex magick instruction of the seventhdegree) significantly different from that found in Francis King’s Secret Rituals of theOT O and in the original manuscript at the Warburg; Koenig’s book How to Make YourOwn OTO; and an early typescript version of the fourth degree (Lodge of Perfection)with a handwritten note by Gerald Yorke saying this version of the ritual was abandonedbecause of objections from freemasons that it was too close to their own Royal Archrite. On that last item, incidentally, it might be noted that the penalty in the published4° ritual—“having my skull sawn off and my brains exposed to the searing rays of theSun”—is a direct rip-off from freemasonry. It is the explanation of the symbolism of"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"76the skull placed in the temple during the installation of a candidate as a member of themasonic Order of Knight Templars.In March 1999 Fernee publicly laid open at length on the Internet the Caliphateoto’s persecution of him and stressed that he had never sold any materials obtainedthrough his membership of the oto, but in a post on alt.magick, May 31, 1999, hereported that he had just been expelled. Fernee’s statements were a powerful indictmentof the petty politics at the heart of Bill Breeze’s Caliphate. In my own considered opinion,it was probably the significantly different variant of the seventh degree sex magickinstruction by Crowley that they couldn’t bear the thought of being available, let aloneadvertised for sale to all bidders by one of their own. Had they acted with the dignitybefitting a magical Order pursuing the Great Work they might have just quietlypurchased it themselves, as it turned out to this day they do not know what it containsnor do they know its new owner. Fernee, on the strict instructions of the private collectorwho was selling these items, allowed no-one to view them, regarding the informationas being for the new owner alone. I might also add that a copy of Francis King’s SecretRituals of the OTO that I borrowed from the British Library’s Boston Spa facility has aninteresting pencil annotation specifically appended to De Natura Deorum, with no furtherpencil marks anywhere in the book. I considered rubbing it out, but no, it is still there,for all I know it may be of historical importance. What does it say? Now that would betelling. Ask me in the pub.Ben Fernee was involved as the Caliphate’s “Inquisitor” of David Rietti (“FraterProspero”, formerly “Fr. Thanatos”) in 1995, who oldtime KAOS readers will rememberas the pompous oaf who once threatened me with a libel suit for an attack on his goodname and reputation, upon which a barrister at Gray’s Inn I asked to comment saidafter studying the relevant documents: “It would be difficult to lower Mr Rietti’sreputation further in the eyes of right thinking people.” Rietti, now the “Black Magusof Manchester” and another reincarnation of John Dee (in the 80s he used to be AleisterCrowley, who himself claimed to be the reincarnation of Dee’s magical partner EdwardKelly, so that posits some intriguing questions), was expelled from the Caliphate otoalong with his wife Irene Fraenkl-Rietti (“Soror Phoenix”) at the end of January 1996for a catalogue of misdemeanours hard to fathom in their entirety (frankly, I can’t bebothered) but on a cursory glance at the evidence it seems to involve them garneringbusiness for their tattoo parlour—“Tattooed Lady Body Art”—from oto initiates (thefifth degree, in particular, requires the candidate to get tattooed). The entire transcriptof Fernee’s Inquisition of the Riettis is quite hilarious, particularly the first line byDavid Rietti, and is on the web at: http://www.mysunrise.ch/users/prkoenig/inquisition/trans.htm."},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"77As a result of this expulsion, Rietti set up the “Ordo Templi Orientis Foundation”,complete with a Panamanian registry like many a rustbucket shipping line. He announcedhis new oto on April 22, 1996, on various magical newsgroups on the Internet, primarilyto piss off the Caliphate oto. The actual foundation of the oto Foundation is quiteintriguing and raised an interesting question about “hidden lineages”. A mysteriousmagus known as “Master Scorpio” claimed to possess the “Pentalpha” authority of theFraternitas Saturni, giving him the power to bestow upon Rietti his very own oto, anda whole gaggle of Manchester Caliphate oto groupies fell for it hook, line, and sinkerand defected or were similarly expelled. It is said that being of the 18th degree of theFraternitas Saturni gives one the power to create an oto. And because few people inthe occult possess the confidence to declare this a load of cobblers, lest they look likeuninitiated fools, yet another oto dangles by a slender thread of credibility. Thus DavidRietti is now the Supreme and Most Holy King of the oto Foundation, and his grandpalace is c /o New Aeon Books, Manchester.“Master Scorpio” is in fact Ralph Tegtmeier, currently a software developer in Belgiumwho is better known as Frater U∴D∴ (who was Frater V∴D∴ before he changed hismagical name on being published in America, it wouldn’t have done his sales any goodon his sex magick book). Frater U∴D∴ has the rare distinction of being expelled fromthe German iot (Illuminates of Thanateros)—which has the motto “...Everything isPermitted”—for “abusing his position and membership of an ultra right-wing mind-control cult” as the mild-mannered Pete Carroll put it, referring to Tegtmeier’s “IceMagic Wars” and the formation of riot."},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"79CorrespondenceControl of Choronzon “In Nomine Babalon”Joel—The idea that Choronzon is controlled “In Nomine Babalon” I believe relates toa complex constellation of symbols. Chapter 49 of Liber 333 states this explicitly, andgives Her Name as “the Seal upon the Ring that is on the Fore-finger of it: and it is theSeal upon the Tombs of them whom She hath slain.” And in the commentary, Crowleysays: “Paragraph 7 explains the theological difficulty referred to above. There is only onesymbol, but this symbol has many names: of those names babalon is the holiest. It isthe name referred to in Liber Legis, 1, 22.” What precisely the “theological difficulty”might be is unclear to me at this time, but it appears that by babalon he means that bythe mark of the magistry of the Master of the Temple is Choronzon silenced, or that isone interpretation. This makes sense, at least to me. Silence is only possible for a MagisterTempli, and I think somewhere it is stated that the Magister Templi is required to enterthe Abyss and “master” Choronzon. It is the Silence under the Night of Pan, where theMasters sit encamped and bloodless on the Great Sea of Binah.What really happened in Orinda that night, when three sat together at 3:33 am inthe 19th Æthyr? It is a curious tale, and will be included in “the essay”. Rememberingwhat happened and why was a bit of a watershed for me, a couple of weeks back. Jonesonce told me that the 19th is the 10th, with a choice. There is no choice in the 10th. It’s apuzzling comparison, and not obvious from Crowley’s Visions, but seems to agree withmy experience.In the 19th Æthyr, I witnessed Choronzon manifest, “for real”, and the only way thatI made it through unscathed, even amused by the proceedings, was by virtue of anenclosed silence where I could not be touched, or affected, in any way. I was folded upinto myself, and words fail me here attempting to describe it. Three of us sat in Silence,while those around us screamed, and cried, and argued incessantly, and literally physicallytore at one another in fear and loathing.

That’sas close as I can get. It was sheer madness, and made perfect sense, all at the same time.Whether or not this identified myself as a “Master”, I suppose, is beside the point. Ican only state that under the circumstances that night, I was capable of playing the part.There is more to the tale, and you shall soon enough hear the rest. I will add here thatI now believe, as of my last review of the data, that whatever the rupture was that led to“The Black Lodge of Santa Cruz”, it “came down” here, in Orinda, in the heart of that“madness” of the 19th Æthyr.It is with no little difficulty that I can connect this with Her Holy Name, logically.But that is my experience. It does seem to work, as I think you have proven for yourself.Perhaps Babalon is, in a sense, the containment vessel of all things, even Choronzon.I’m still writing on the Orinda working, and perhaps more will fall out in the process.I am not at all surprised to hear of the influence 418 had on your experiences in1988, “intersecting with my experience” is a perfect description of my experiences aswell. When I had largely rejected Crowley (the Vision of the Demon Crowley is anapparently universal stage of progress), The Vision and the Voice was the only work Icould not reject. Its meaning for me, even then, was just too great. So I sympathize withyour being forced to re-evaluate Crowley in light of that document. 418 has had aprofound impact on my life and my work. It is, in many ways, the framework of myexperience and the lens through which I view matters spiritual.I have a xerox of Tallqvist’s “Maqlû” text. It was rumored to have had disruptiveeffects, back when I first copied it for David Jones. It’s an Assyrian transcription of aSumerian text, and contains an invocation of the god Sin (thus Jones’s reason for wantingit). It is rumored to be one of the sources used for a portion of the Simonomicon. Sincethe “lilitu” come out of Mesopotamia, I’m wondering whether they’re in that text. Littlereluctant to dig it out and look, but I suspect I will. The translation is into German, andaside from a few half-remembered phrases, my Deutsch isn’t that good.I also have a musty old reprint of Forlong’s A Cyclopedia of Religions (London, 1906).Under “Lilith” it reads, in part:According to Talmudists, Lilith sinned in refusing to be submissive to man, saying thatshe was created with Adam, and that he should not rule her. She learned the holy “name”(of Yahveh), and so obtained wings, and flew from Paradise: angels found her hoveringover the Red Sea. She refused to return to Adam, and the curse on her was pronouncedto be that every child she bore should die in infancy... She snares youths with amorous"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"81kisses, giving them pleasant dreams, but (as with Lamia, and the Succuba) they dieafterwards of vain longings. Lilith became the consort of Samael and together they are“the Beast,” and the producers of evil beings. She appears as the richly robed bride of thisevil angel, captivating men with her sparkling eyes of love, and her beauty, and makingthe home unhappy. Hence she is called “the harlot,” and she was the spirit of jealousy,hating Adam, and his meek consort Eve, and introducing the apple of discord. Sheappeared on the tree of life—as a human headed serpent—in medieval missals.And in the article “Kabbala”: “Thence came the material world, also with 10 degrees ofbadness or grosser Sephiroth, 1 of Chaos, 2 of Darkness, and 7 of the seven Hells.These were ruled by Samael and his consort, who together are the Beast.”Now, if this makes sense, recall that the Kabbalists also imagined them going at itunder the throne. So, the throne, in a sense, is resting on “the Beast”. Curiously, the tie-in, between Mesopotamia and Enochian, is the concept of “the throne”, that I wasresearching just earlier this year. Wild.I’m slowly putting all this together. I’ve traced the Lilith concept into one translationof Zohar, and am working on another. Her name comes from lil, night, and is believedto be a very primitive root.I too revisited Liber 49, just last week. I can’t recall if I’ve ever “gone into” the 7thÆthyr. My journals seem silent on the matter.Take care, SATYRJack Parsons’ blunder on the Seventh AireLiber 49 mentioned above is part of The Book of Babalon received by Jack Parsons. Inline 23 Babalon instructs Parsons: “Also seek me in the Seventh Aire.” On re-readingthe text I was surprised to see that Parsons had blundered in his fifth invocation byintoning in Enochian the 7th Angelic Key, which, though the 7th Call, is not “The Callof the Seventh Aire”, as he erroneously titles it. He should have substituted deo for lilin the 19th Key, the Key of the 30 Aires, to access the 7th Aire or Æthyr. This seems avery basic error for someone who had been “engaged in the study and practice of Magickfor seven years, and in the supervision and operation of an occult lodge for four years”,as he writes of himself in the introduction to The Book of Babalon. In addition, the 7thKey that Parsons reproduces is also missing several words and corrupts others. In this"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"82regard, it is curious that Michael Staley in his essay “The Babalon Working/Belovèd ofBabalon” in Starfire I, 3 (1989), while realising that the 7th Key is corrupt in Parsons’version and correcting it for republication, did not similarly realise that it is not the Callof the 7th Aire.In Crowley’s skrying of the 7th Aire in The Vision and the Voice he speaks of seeing“the form of a woman like the woman in the Apocalypse, but her beauty and her radianceare such that one cannot look thereon, save with sidelong glances”. There are somestriking descriptions of “the lady of the Æthyr” and Crowley says the splendour of thevision is difficult to bear.Parsons doesn’t explain why he called his text Liber 49, but Chapter 49 in The Book ofLies is about Babalon and also The Book of Babalon has 77 verses, and 7×7 = 49.The biography Sex and Rockets: The Occult World of Jack Parsons is reviewed in thisissue, see p 168.JBFrom Necronomicons to Pazuzu and whirlwindsThe “Simonomicon” mentioned earlier is the popular name for the Simon Necronomicon,first published in 1977, which many people who get into the occult from role-playinggames and comics imagine is a real grimoire, and even those who know the book wasmade up persist in believing it was “channelled”. The Simon Necronomicon does, however,contain fragments from the “Maqlû” text, which is a genuine Sumerian curse text thattranslates as “Burning”. This may account for the fact that a number of people appear tohave got their fingers burnt by playing around with the “spells” in the SimonNecronomicon. Such people can regularly be seen asking for advice on occult newsgroups,such as this classic I saved from a teenager:I accidentally used the sign of Kosh to invoke the seal of the Worm that Gnaws and nowmy dog Sparky is dead and I need to know how to send the Worm that Gnaws back intothe great abyss!George Hiram Derby, proprietor of “Panpipes Magickal Marketplace”, an occult trinketsstore in Hollywood, encapsulates the manner in which the Simon Necronomicon was“channelled”:"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"83It was written in a New York apartment above a now defunct landmark occult shopknown as the Magickal Childe.

Theyresearched Sumerian/Babylonian religion and creation myths at the ny city library forless than a week. The story line and everything else in the book was written over peals ofdrunken laughter.

Die AssyrischeBeschwörungsserie Maqlû: Nach den Originalen im British Museum Herausgegeben.Helsingfors, 1895. The Maqlû text is a collection of spells, in cuneiform charactersimpressed on clay tablets, found in the library of the Assyrian king Ashurbanipal atNineveh. The supposed origin of the Simon Necronomicon is that an Eastern Orthodoxbishop named Simon walked into the Magickal Childe one day claiming to have in hispossession a 9th century Greek manuscript stolen from a private collection. Much toeveryone’s surprise the manuscript turned out to be the Necronomicon written about inH P Lovecraft’s stories. Even William S Burroughs caught wind of it and turned up tocheck out the manuscript, as recollected by the illustrator Khem Caigan: “After goingthrough the pages and a few lines of powder, he offered the comment that it was ‘goodshit’. He might have meant the manuscript, too—check out the ‘Invocation’ on pagexvii of his Cities of the Red Night.”The “George Hay” Necronomicon was faked by Colin Wilson and a few friends, whichhe admitted in an article—“The Necronomicon: The Origin of a Spoof ”—in issue 23 ofCrypt of Cthulhu magazine, published in 1984. Even though H P Lovecraft stated onmany occasions that he invented the Necronomicon for use in his stories, and no pre-Lovecraft Necronomicon has ever been found, this was not enough to prevent KennethGrant and his Typhonians from insisting that he had been “trafficking” (I don’t knowwhy they always use that word) with “trans-mundane” (or that one) entities. Perhapsthe epitome of what can be achieved with the Necronomicon was reached in Starfire Vol.II, No. 2, in the article by Nicholaj Frisvold: “Into the Depths of Severity and AllBeauty: Some Remarks on the Necronomicon Gnosis”, pp 73–95. Were it not for thefact that I think Frisvold is serious, I would have no hesitation in highly recommendingthis article as a brilliant parody on Lovecraft mythos occultism. On the other hand, thearticle in the same issue by Stephen Dziklewicz, “A Mantra for Evoking the Great Old"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"84Ones”, pp 107–122, is one of the better essays written on the subject, conveying wellthe essence of personal evocatory experience irrespective of whether one is evokingfigments of the imagination or actual entities (some may rightly wonder: what’s thedifference?).As an aside, given the use of Maqlû text fragments in the Simon Necronomicon, andwhether that may have had some magical effect, it is interesting to consider the extentto which the 1973 film The Exorcist might be regarded as an evocation of the demonPazuzu, who was not a fictional creation but an Assyrian pestilential wind demon, whoaccording to some brings disease but others regard as protecting against disease(ironically, given the depiction in The Exorcist, he is a protective spirit for children sincehe is the enemy of the Babylonian female child-killing demon Lamastu, who appearsto be similar to Lilith). The demon is particularly associated with the south-east stormwind. Pazuzu has four feathered wings, sometimes with feathered legs, the talons of aneagle, a man-like body sometimes showing the ribs, a scorpion tail, possibly lion’s pawsfor hands, and ghoulish head, also said by some to resemble a lion. According to JeremyBlack and Anthony Green, in Gods, Demons and Symbols of Ancient Mesopotamia, Pazuzuhas a snake-headed penis. In all the amulets I have seen Pazuzu has his right armraised, elbow bent, and the left arm lowered, elbow bent or fully stretched out (contrastwith the famous terracotta relief image supposedly of Lilith, flanked by two owls andstanding on two lions, with both arms raised bent at the elbows). Possibly Pazuzu issynonymous with the earlier Zu bird (aka Anzu), the half-bird half-man (originally alion-headed eagle) who nested in Inanna’s Huluppu Tree with Lilith before being scaredaway by Gilgamesh.According to Thorkild Jacobsen, Anzu “represented the numinous power ofthunderstorms”. Anzu is the Akkadian name of the Sumerian Imdugud, the lion-headedeagle who embodied the power of dense storm clouds and whose name is also used towrite a word meaning “fog” or “mist”. Imdugud was gigantic and could cause whirlwindsand sandstorms by the flapping of his wings, which links in with Pazuzu as a winddemon. Satyr pointed out to me that Job 38:1 is interesting in this regard, in that theLord answers Job out of a whirlwind. Looking further into this theme, I notice that inJob 37:9, Isaiah 21:1, and Zechariah 9:14 the whirlwind comes from the south, and in2 Kings 2:1 Elijah was taken up to heaven in a whirlwind. In Jeremiah 23:19 and 30:23the Lord goes forth in a whirlwind to manifest his judgement.It is intriguing, actually, that I should get onto Pazuzu as a result of making a fewnotes about Simon’s Necronomicon, because just earlier this evening I decided I wantedto paint a picture of the Zu bird, an entity that has been on my mind for several weeksnow. I planned to make up some imaginary bird because the only image I had come"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"85across of the Zu bird was a small picture from a cylinder seal impression and it was hardto make out the details. In considering the use of genuine occult fragments in theSimonomicon I was reminded of the use of Pazuzu in The Exorcist and came acrosssome excellent representations of this demon on the web. Only then did I start towonder whether there was some connection between Pazuzu and the Zu bird.In the “Invocation” in Cities of the Red Night, Burroughs described Pazuzu: “Lord ofFevers and Plagues, Dark Angel of the Four Winds with rotting genitals from whichhe howls through sharpened teeth over stricken cities...” This inaccurate vision is adirect lift from the Simonomicon.Stephen Sennitt wrote an essay on Pazuzu entitled “The Demon of the South-WestWind” (on the web at: http://www.phhine.ndirect.co.uk/archives/sp_pazuzu.htm).Sennitt’s error of attributing Pazuzu to the south-west wind as opposed to the south-east wind also appears to have been derived from the Simonomicon.JOEL BIROCOBack on LilithHi Joel—I’m back working on the Lilith issue, as I’ve said. Spent most of yesterday onit, in fact, reading and scanning through Cory’s A Chaldean Account of Genesis, and othertexts, in search of possible clues (cognates of lilith do indeed appear in the “Maqlû”text, by the way). My preliminary feeling at the moment is that she represents a “barren”female who practices magick. She seems to almost stand in relation to Babalon as doesNephthys to Isis. And from whatever angle I approach her, she appears to be intimatelybound-up with the Fall. I find it telling that I experience no little difficulty with thewhole concept: shouldn’t have been such a “good boy” most of my life. A little moretime in the “mire” of this world and a little less spent contemplating the Ineffable mighthave helped immensely. It’s never too late, though. Half-asleep, and more than a little strung-out, I started back into Lilith, withoutlooking at the link you sent. Ended-up ferreting out many of the same quotes that werealready available to you. But following a footnote in one of the translations I had, yieldedsome “new” material, and a slightly different take on the matter.The new moon seems to have got me going again. Spent the whole day on the Liliththing, and I append my Lilith pseudo-essay to this email. I think my analysis andconclusions stink, personally, but I quoted at length from my sources and they themselves"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"86are pretty good. Hope it does something for you, other than sending your good selfinto a confused slumber.On to your email: I was aware of the abábâlond reference. It is most fortuitous I mustagree. I cited the key I did as it was received by Dee and Kelly before the 19th. Theangels seemed well aware of Her nature and Name.Geoffrey James’s Enochian book is indeed good, but is lacking in many respects. HisLatin is weak, at times (though I’m going from memory and haven’t made a recentcomparison), and he doesn’t seem to grasp the nature of the material accurately orthoroughly in many respects. Thus his lack of suitable explanatory texts.There are 49 Keys, and not 19 as might appear. The “first” Key, sometimes called the“zero Key” is extracted from the “Round Table of Nalvage”, and may be seen on BenRowe’s site: http://w3.one.net/~browe/enochian.htm. It appears to express thefundamental duality of existence, and the angels told Dee not to use it, but deviouscreatures they were, gave it to him just the same. The “19th Key” is used for all 30 of theÆthyrs. As written, it contains the name lil, the first Æthyr. To perform the call of anyother Æthyr, simply substitute its name for that of the first.Therefore, there are 1+18+30 = 49 Keys, total. There are other Golden Dawnishways of getting at the Æthyrs through the Keys, but we’ll get to that in due time. It hasto do with how the sigils of the “Governors” are overlaid on the Great Table.If you find yourself “hooked” on Enochian, you have my deepest sympathy. It hasbeen many years since I was first introduced, and I am as fascinated today as I was backthen. Odd as it may seem, Grady once said that you don’t have to call the Enochianspirits: when you’re ready, they will come for you. I don’t pretend to stand in your shoes,but as an observer, it seems that with kaos-babalon, as it’s been manifesting of late,this indeed seems to be the case for you. Hope you find this as amusing as I do.The “cryptography as proof ” angle I like. When you read some of the diaries, youwill find that some of the material was received by the angels pointing out the letters ontables, copies of which Dee had constructed for this purpose. It provided sort of adouble-blind. Really neat concept, that.I had intended to append the chunks of “the Maqlû” text to this email, but it isalready somewhat late, it’s hotter than the hinges of hell up here in the office, and it willjust have to wait. Lilith, as one of a trio of nocturnal beasties, definitely makes anappearance, in three separate passages, and the text contains an Assyrian, or I supposean Assyrian translation of a Sumerian, charm against them. Really neat stuff. I was ledto believe that these clay tablets are in fact the oldest known grimoire. Tallqvist translatesthem into German, the same language as his paper.

I will send the Assyrian transliterations,the German translations, and the text of the relevant footnote, for starters, just as soonas I get them keyed-in.Take care, my friend, SATYR[Ed’s note—Satyr’s “pseudo-essay” on Lilith, entitled “Here beginneth the worke ofthe demonesse Lilith”, has not been included in KAOS, but is available to interestedparties from the author (satyr418 @hotmail.com). I would, however, like to quote itsfinal paragraph:In conclusion, I feel we may assert that Lilith is found embodied among us. She isstrong and defiant, a wielder of the forces of the Tetragrammaton. An enchantress ofprofound beauty, she is capable of draining the life out of any who approach her (at leastone who does so passively), receiving and gestating that life into fantastic and demonicforms. Sex, for her, is not for procreation, but a tool of great power for her magick, andis the sacrament of divine rapture. Though defiant, and ostensibly refusing to submit,she is, at the same time, a full physical manifestation of her Mother, Babalon, and asmuch the embodiment of her as any woman, and as capable of fulfilling her Holy Office.The old Rabbis may have cursed, feared, and shunned her, but among us in this latter ageshe may be honored among the “Magi”, standing coequal with her male counterparts.On Geoffrey James’s book, Robert Turner in Elizabethan Magic (p 89) has pointed outhis error in thinking the “8 viols of wrath” in the 9th key could have been a reference toa violin, apparently missing the allusion to the “7 vials” in Revelation 17:1. “Wormwood”is also mentioned in the 9th key, a clear allusion to the Apocalypse.]Because Hers is the bed of BabalonJust as cryptography can provide a “proof ” of the genuineness of spirit communication(see the notes on the Steganographia), the method by which Dee and Kelly obtainedEnochian attests to the angels’ inclination to communicate in such a way as to rule outthat the “messages” were a mere fantastic projection of the human mind, the mainproblem when considering “channelled material” for scholarly use. There were 2,401letters and numbers on each 49 by 49 table, one or more tables would be used, andapparently there were 49 tables in total; some tables contained whole words rather than"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"88letters according to Donald Laycock in The Complete Enochian Dictionary. (It has to besaid that no single author that myself or Satyr has consulted appears to fully grasp thefacts here nor relates them in a satisfactory fashion, suffice it to say that one such tableis printed on p 24 of Turner’s Elizabethan Magic, a square from Liber Logæth, Sloanems. 3189, and this contains only English letters and single-digit numbers.) The angelconveyed the appropriate square on the table in a complex fashion that is not particularlyclear (not simply by rank and column as Crowley and Regardie suggested). When themessage was complete, it was to be rewritten backwards, it had in fact been dictatedbackwards. The backwards dictation continued until the first four Keys had been received,the angel then went forwards. The resultant texts were conjurations in a language vulgarlycalled “Enochian”, originally simply “Angelic”, which translated into truly profoundpassages such as this extract referring to Babalon (bábâlond, “Harlot” [BABALOND])evoking an image of a whore’s bed as a sanctuary after a kind of cataclysm that hasreduced the world to a wasteland, which accords with one of my own deep experienceswith Babalon 12 years before I even knew of the existence of this passage in an Enochianconjuration:The reasonable creatures of Earth, or Men,Let them vex and weed out one another;And the dwelling places, let them forget their names.The work of man and his pomp, let them be defaced.His buildings, let them become caves for the beasts of the field.Confoundeth Her understanding with darkness.For why? It repenteth me I ever made Man.One while let Her be known, and another while a stranger,Because Hers is the bed of Babalon, dwelling place of him that is Fallen.This passage is from the 19th Key, ie the Call or Key of the 30 Æthyrs. In the last line Ihave made a slightly different translation from usual according to my own contextualunderstanding. The received translation is: “Bycause she is the bed of an Harlot, andthe dwelling place of him that is faln”. To me this seems cockeyed, how can “she” be a“bed”?—it seems more straightforward to render it “Because Hers is the bed of Babalon”.(I write more on the identity of “Him that is Fallen”, Telocvovim [TELOCVOVIM],further on in KAOS.) Note that Crowley in the 2nd Æthyr in The Vision and the Voicesays that the sentence “It repenteth me I ever made Man” should really be translated as“It rejoiceth me concerning the Virgin and the Man”. Crowley claims Kelly didn’tunderstand the Call and altered what the angel told him to fit his own interpretation.(On the principle that Crowley supposedly knew what the angel originally said to Kelly,"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"89either because this was obvious in skrying the Æthyr or because Crowley claimed to bethe reincarnation of Edward Kelly.) I find this a most unconvincing statement,particularly given that in Liber LXXXIV vel Chanokh, first published in The EquinoxVol. I, No. VIII (September, 1912) under a more verbose title, Crowley gives the sameline as “It repenteth me that I have made Man”. The Vision and the Voice appeared in anearlier issue, Vol. I, No. V (March, 1911), so presumably Crowley changed his mindabout the line and reverted to Kelly’s original.In pondering passages such as that from the 19th Key—and recalling how it wasushered into existence by angelic dictation to Kelly, and how Aleister Crowley used thiscall that contains this passage in the original Enochian to skry all 30 of the Æthyrs,thereby obtaining parts of what appears to be a fragmented story about Chaos andBabalon, that later went on to draw myself and Amodali to initiate the kaos-babalon156 current, and to separately inspire “The Black Lodge of Santa Cruz”—I am given towonder what the long-term gameplan of the angels actually is. Donald Tyson believesEnochian magick is intended to bring on the Apocalypse (Enochian Magic for Beginners[1997] and in more detail in “The Enochian Apocalypse” in Gnosis 40, Summer 1996).Tyson asks: “Were John Dee’s Enochian Keys of magic intended to unleash violentoccult forces that would hurl us into another age?” Tyson answers his own question inthe affirmative, and has been much ridiculed by serious occultists because of it:I will present what I believe to be the angels’ secret agenda, which they concealed fromDee: to plant among mankind the ritual working that would initiate the period of violenttransformation between the present aeon and the next, commonly known as the Apocalypse.It begs the question why Tyson would want to write a book “for beginners” on such amagick. There is no doubt, however, that there is a great deal of Apocalyptic imagery inthe Keys, but the Apocalypse as Donald Tyson perceives it is essentially the doomladenversion of Christianity. To me the Enochian Keys and their relation to the 156 currentare about the rediscovery of one’s true self through The Fall and coming to know thefemale stranger the Great Whore Babalon whose bed one comes to lie in and whosestory is a Mystery to behold emerging in fragmentary visions throughout the Ages. It isa hidden myth the most vital broken sherds of which are deeply embedded in our ownflesh from a distant past we have lost our understanding of, the confounded “dark”understanding of Babalon. How does this link in with the Apocalypse? Crowley in hisConfessions puts it well:The nineteenth Key contains the text of the original curse on creation. Each phraseformulates some calamity. I had always shuddered at its horror as I recited it. But now,"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"90the Abyss being crossed, and all its horror faced and mastered, the words of the Keysuddenly thrilled with a meaning that I had never suspected. Each curse concealed ablessing.This accords with my own experience of Babalon, a woman of the Apocalypse of whomthere is nothing good said in The Revelation of St John the Divine. St John “ConfoundethHer understanding with darkness”. In fact, Crowley in his synopsis of the contents ofThe Vision and the Voice is even more specific about the nature of one particular blessing.He spells it out clearly in his synopsis of the 2nd Æthyr: “The Marriage of the Seer withbabalon: The understanding of the Curse, that is become a blessing. The final rewardof the Magister Templi, his marriage even with Babalon Herself. The pæon thereof.” Inthe 2nd Æthyr Crowley reports from his vision what I consider to be one of the mostilluminating statements ever made concerning the nature of the Apocalypse:All I get is that the Apocalypse was the recension of a dozen or so totally disconnectedallegories, that were pieced together, and ruthlessly planed down to make them into aconnected account; and that recension was re-written and edited in the interests ofChristianity, because people were complaining that Christianity could show no truespiritual knowledge, or any food for the best minds: nothing but miracles, which onlydeceived the most ignorant, and Theology, which only suited pedants.Given that the kaos-babalon 156 current can be traced back to The Vision and theVoice, and beyond that to the Enochian operations of Dee and Kelly, it is also interestingto note that 156 is the number of letters in each of the four 12 by 13 EnochianWatchtowers of the Angelic or Great Table (Turner, p 56; James, p 117).JOEL BIROCOImpromptu review of Donald TysonHi Joel—You asked me about Tyson, I assume you are referring to Enochian Magic forBeginners. I bought this book with great excitement, and found it rather disappointing.I really didn’t care for his speculations and interpretations, though too much time haspassed for me to recall the particulars as to why, nor at this date am I in a position tocomment on the accuracy of the information it contains. It may be significant thatthumbing through my copy I find no notes of correction."},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"91Tyson is a little clueless regarding some particulars, which leads me to question thedepth of his investigation. For instance, he is baffled why Dee would exchange thecolors of the “Clothes of Passage”, East and West, North and South, when he engravedKelly’s vision of the Watchtowers. The answer is simple: if one sets a crystal sphere inthe center of the diagram, and views it through the sphere, the colors appear in theirproper quarters. It seems to be a way of “encoding” the relationship between the “inner”and “outer” worlds. I think that this particular instance of this device is not unique inDee’s work.The title is a bit of a misnomer, as it’s a more in-depth treatment of the subject thanthe beginner might hope. For this reason alone I think it might be of some value toyour investigations. It is not one I’d personally recommend, but by the same token I’vefound it very useful to read as many different books on the subject as possible as I’m sureyou will agree. The only interpretation of the Enochian corpus that is of any real valueis the one you build for yourself in your own head, by definition constructed piecemealfrom the works of others. Hope this helps, despite my answering both yes and no.Take care, SATYRPS—If Tyson is correct about “The Apocalypse Working” (p 274), then the worldended shortly after dawn in Mountain View, California, on 20 June 1990, the first timeI ever did a Watchtower ritual using all 18 elemental Keys, in sequence.The Egyptian parallel: Set and NephthysHi Joel—How, exactly, Lilith ties in with Babalon I’m not entirely sure. I am temptedto say that they are both the Harlot, there being similarities in the Zoharic passages Isent you with the Babylon of Revelation. I suspect there may have been some influenceof the latter on the former, given the chronology, but it’s all theory and conjecture. Now,it’s fairly obvious from the text of Revelation that Babylon is, in fact, Rome: She sits onseven hills, the ten horns are the ten Caesars (if memory serves), etc. But this imagerycomes out of a Jewish tradition, and is being recorded by (presumably) a Greek-speakingJew. So we should expect the image to somehow trace back to Mesopotamia, alongwith many other aspects of Judaic theology.I was surprised at the similarities of Samael/Lilith to Set/Nephthys, once I startedreading Budge. I can’t rule out at this point an Egyptian influence on the Lilith “myth”."},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"92Subtracting this hypothetical element, we are left with Lilith the Queen of the Night,in all her colorful finery, seducing males in their sleep. “The Beast” is then the “impure”male whom she rides while they dream, perhaps.Otherwise, if we ignore the Babylonian influence, and stick with the Egyptian versionof the story, our hypothetical Lilith construct “reduces” to Nephthys, “Perfection”,“Death”, “Corruption”, “Lady of the Night”, again (as Isis was Lady of the Day), the“Solve” half of the equation. Physically, Nephthys accommodates and pays homage tothe Holy and prodigious ass’s phallus of her brother and husband Set, by spreading hercheeks and giving it up the hard way (gotta love these Egyptians). For a pervert such asmyself, it’s a bit of religious iconography worthy of great reverence and no little awe.Set was one of the greatest of the Egyptian deities, from the earliest times, and onlyfell from favor after the Hyksos occupation, as they somehow associated him withcertain Semitic or Syrian gods (Budge says “Baal”, usually rendered in Egyptian as“Bar”. I must go back and look at his various mates, soon). He was apparently shown aspart of a composite figure, often portrayed as a dual of Horus-Set in combination.According to Budge, he was in every respect the equal of “Heru-ur”, “Horus the Elder”,the flavor of Horus intended in the composition, and as such may be productivelycompared with the third chapter of the Book of the Law. Budge also notes that the skyby day was symbolized by Horus, and that of the night by Set. Though he was associatedwith the South, his kingdom was in the northern sky, and he is somehow associatedwith the constellation Ursa Major. When we went successfully into the 19th Æthyr thattime in Orinda, ca, Set was “shown” to be the “Pole Star”. This came as quite a shock toboth David and myself.Nephthys remained popular, despite her associations, even after her husband andbrother Set had been demonized. Given the Jehovic directive to “be fruitful and multiply”,we can imagine quite easily what the Jews would have thought of Nephthys. Theygenerally frowned on any form of sexual activity that did not lead to popping screamingwigglers, despite their patron deity’s sexual proclivities, as attested by numerous passagesin the Old Testament about the Levites and the Qadoshim. (Aside: What do you makeof the quotes from the Old Testament in the second chapter of the Book of the Law?)Is any of this making sense? I’m just rambling along with this, hoping maybesomething will strike a spark.SATYRPS—I’ve thought about your description of that table in Enochian Sex Magick [p 146].From what you say, I’d expect it’s part of the “Rudd” material.

Adam McLeanspeculates that Dr Rudd may have come by John Dee’s Enochian material via his son,the alchemist Arthur Dee, he whose famous comment about a mysterious manuscriptpossessed by his father contributed to the popular notion that John Dee had the Voynichmanuscript before he supposedly sold it to Rudolf II of Bohemia. I’ve checked Dee’slibrary catalogue, incidentally, and I couldn’t find anything resembling the Voynichms.]"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"94Slippery steps down into theenigma of the Voynich MS.by Joel BirocoThe allure of a strange undeciphered manuscript that has taxed the minds ofmedievalists and cryptographers alike and ruined at least one scholarly reputationFrom time to time I go back to toying with studying the Voynich manuscript, catalogueentry #408 in the Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library at Yale University, 204pages on vellum, the book that no-one can read. The last time I got excited about it waswhen Dana F Scott on the Voynich ms. mailing list said she had identified the waratah[Telopea speciosissima] as a “wonderful match” for folio 50v ( June 9, 2001). I wascoincidentally writing about Aleister Crowley’s poem in The Book of Lies, “Waratah-Blossoms”, at the time, so Dana’s message caught my attention. Crowley uses the waratahto allude to the Scarlet Woman, given that it is a brilliant scarlet flower. The waratah isindigenous to New South Wales and was known to have been first introduced intoEurope by Sir James Smith in 1793. Or possibly the Dutch navigator Plesart couldhave brought seeds back after he explored Western Australia in 1629. So I immediatelythought to myself if this identification is correct then it could have dating implicationsalong the lines of the “O’Neill sunflower hypothesis”, which suggested that the Voynichms. must have been written after 1493 when Columbus brought the seeds to Europe,thus ruling out Roger Bacon as the supposed author (the plant depicted on folio 93rlooks like the sunflower—see Speculum 19 [1944]). But on turning to folio 50v I wascrestfallen, alas the flower wasn’t scarlet! A wonderful match, except in colour. It wasblue. Dana had been working from a black and white copy and had been premature.But rather than let go of the idea immediately, I found myself indulging the mostbizarre speculation that maybe the plant had been painted in an ink that reacted to acidand alkali like litmas paper, blue in alkali but red in acid. After all, those art historianswho argued on the whys and wherefores of Van Gogh’s strange choice of yellow for his"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"95sunflowers didn’t have an ounce of chemistry sense between them, otherwise it wouldhave been obvious to them that the pigment chosen by Van Gogh was originallysunflower yellow but went that strange colour it is today as a result of a reaction causedby atmospheric pollution. Examining my theory of the Voynich ink changing colourthe next day, however, I recalled how one should really tie oneself to the mast to protectoneself from the manuscript’s Siren call drawing scholars onto the rocks.At one time I felt the key to solving the mystery of the Voynich ms. lay in itsastronomical diagrams. Not in the other-worldly plants illustrated alongside the(supposedly) encrypted text. For these weird botanical specimens resist identificationwith a peculiar tenacity, while yet resembling specific plants in the more fluid spaces ofmemory and dream. When I first began to look at the manuscript I noticed a plant Irecognised but couldn’t remember its name. That night I awoke from a dream shoutingaloud: “It’s a white campion!” It seemed like a revelation, yet it was only rememberinga flower, but ever since then I have been fascinated by the manuscript’s power to excitewonder and offer small breakthroughs while forever withholding almost everything. Ithink I would go mad with frustration had I not learnt to tear myself away from it aftertoo much sustained interest. I eventually gave up on the flowers and turned to the starcharts. On one of the folios is a diagram showing what seems like an unmistakabledepiction of the juxtaposition of the bright star Aldebaran with the Pleiades, whichwas pointed out suggestively by Bradley E Schaefer in Sky and Telescope magazine in itsNovember 2000 issue, not the first time the magazine has taken an interest in themanuscript’s astronomy section. As if to form a fortuitous Rosetta stone, the stars arelabelled in the same strange script as the rest of the ms. By gathering all the names ofAldebaran and the Pleiades in all plausible languages this labelled star configurationcould be used as a key to open up the door to the Voynich cipher, to this day unbroken.That’s assuming the text is enciphered, for even that most basic assumption is to mymind a likely fallacy.Whenever one is foolhardy enough to allow the fascination with the Voynich ms. togrow—before wresting oneself away once more (some never do)—the questions keeppiling up: what are these curious plants, where do they grow? Are they real plantsstrangely drawn, or imaginary plants? Why are star charts in what could be a book ofbotany, or even plant consciousness, according to one theory. Why the cartoons of rotundwomen in bath barrels, and girls going down waterslides (folio 75r), with each nippledelicately dotted? Early balneological treatises—scientific studies of bathing and mineralsprings—do exist, but in the Voynich ms. the cartoons seem just a little Larsen’s FarSide and the esoteric plumbing systems like something from Dr Seuss. And while itwas common to draw a heroic human face on the sun in medieval manuscripts, the"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"96versions of this tradition in the Voynich ms. have hilarious silly expressions on theirfaces. Of course, and this is where the trickster edge is introduced, it could be an ingenioushoax, either perpetrated by Wilfred Voynich, who discovered the ms. in an Italian Jesuitseminary in 1912, or a medieval demon-possessed jester. And then there is the argumentthat the manuscript, if a hoax, automatically by its complexity and strangeness falls intothe category of art, or a fantastic madness—with the further consideration that the ms.is not actually an encryption of some other language but rather a language in its ownright, written fluently in fast-flowing ink without a single cross-out or alteration. Perhapsits author was possessed, and a solipsistic language, an idiolect, spewed onto the pages.The first claim of decipherment of the Voynich ms. came in lectures given in April1921 in Pennsylvania by Professor William Romaine Newbold, who died in 1926 leavingextensive notes and draft chapters which were published posthumously. (W R Newbold,The Cipher of Roger Bacon. Edited by R G Kent, University of Pennsylvania Press, 1928.)Newbold’s ideas, though initially gaining enthusiastic supporters, were soon decriedand debunked. Nonetheless, Newbold had a seductive theory, still of appeal to thestudent of crazy theories. He said the book was the magnum opus of the 13th centuryeccentric scientific genius and friar Roger Bacon who encrypted his ownership ofinventions not yet invented. Bacon had seen cell nuclei and spermatozoa with hismicroscope and drawn them, he had seen spiral nebulæ with his telescope and drawnthem. It is never quite explained why he drew lots of naked ladies all over his scientificnotebook. Yet Newbold honestly admitted on one of his pages, in passing as if it wasn’tparticularly important, that he frequently found it “impossible to read the same texttwice in exactly the same way”. It is surprising that Newbold did not find this telling,and go on to consider that his difficulty in being able to read the same text twice in thesame way could be accounted for by the idea that what he was seeing had no objectiveexistence.Newbold began as a respected scholar of medieval philosophy and gifted classicist,and ended up spending the last eight years of his life on an obsessive and lunatic pursuitscrewing up his eyes to read the manuscript into the early hours of the morning by astorm lantern. I was aghast as I read his description of the method by which he came byhis deciphered revelations. In all scholarly earnestness, Newbold said that each letter ofthe strange script, if viewed under a powerful magnifying glass, was actually composedof about 20 other tiny letters, and that it was out of these tiny letters he was formingwords and reading the text, seeing mainly a language based on ancient Greek shorthandbut which was capable of metamorphosis into other formations and interpretations.But Newbold didn’t stop there, having discovered that the text concealed Bacon’s use ofhis own invented compound microscope Newbold had an idea:"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"97Deception is the keynote of the whole.

He was the only man on earth possessed of a goodmicroscope, and he relies upon it as part of his apparatus of concealment. I have longknown the fact that his letters were built up out of significant elements and had beenusing an ordinary reading glass to help resolve them, but only about four months ago,when it occurred to me to turn a pretty strong microscope upon them, did I discover thatnearly all the letters which I had been taking as wholes were really perfect nests of tinycharacters.It never seemed to have occurred to him that this was simply the way the pigmentedink had cracked with age on the vellum parchment. The feasibility of meticulouslywriting microscopic shorthand signs such that they built up into letters, words, andsentences that have every appearance of otherwise being fast-flowing freehand strokesin another language is not something Newbold addressed, so convinced was he he wasright.Newbold read all sorts of things into the ms., and spared no effort to understand it,he thought nothing of learning Catalan to resolve a small point. As a boy he had beenthrilled by Sir Henry Layard’s Nineveh and Its Remains, and copied a cuneiform text byimpressing a clay tablet with a stylus. He baked the tablet in the oven and buried it,amusing himself with the thought that one day it might be dug up and lead somescholar to propose the Assyrian conquest of New Jersey. It’s hard not to like and evenadmire Newbold for the enthusiasm he brought to his task and to think of somethingthat is never mentioned by those who see in Newbold only a tragic misguided figure:the sheer joy he must have felt to believe he had cracked the Voynich manuscript, thathe was really onto something, a delusion that sustained him and held him fast in afascination for years until his death. His descriptions of the folios are fully given over tothe boundless eccentricity one might expect on realising that the researcher has tippedover into genuine madness and left his critical faculties behind. The Voynich ms. becamefor Newbold a skrying mirror capable of drawing out subconscious imaginings he thenprojected onto the otherwise unintelligible words and in the end he could, quite literally,read the text.

If d-a-r-g = 6-7-3-9, how come d-â-o-x = 5-6-7-8? It makes nosense to me. What is the current thinking on these numbers?Interestingly enough, doing a web-search on “telocvovim” I came across manyreferences to a black metal band from Finland called “Enochian Crescent”, who havereleased three albums with the word in: “Telocvovim”, “Babalon Patralx De Telocvovim”,and “Omega Telocvovim”. That second one is “Babalon Rock of Telocvovim” (the wordpatralx PATRAL X occurs in the 10th Key, but of course they’ve made up their ownEnochian phrase).Although there is an Enochian word Luciftian (LUCIFTIAN) meaning“ornaments of brightness” (7th Key) and Lucíftîas (LUCIFTIAS), “brightness”,nonetheless Telecvovim does seem to be Lucifer. As for whether Lucifer is Chaos,given Telocvovim’s conjoining with Babalon... Curious too that one of the Enochianwords for “God” is Mad (MAD).Some other Enochian words strike me that they may be the names of individualbeings:Jaida: “The Highest” (Key 1) or Iaida (last word of Key 1 and also last word of Keys11 to 18).Ja-í-don: “All Powerful” (Key 2) or Iaidon Ioiad: “Him that Liveth Forever” (Key 2,final word).Iehúsoz: “His Mercies” (Key 3).Q-có-casb: “Content of Time” (Key 5).Jad-oiás-mômar: “Him that is, was, and shall be crowned” (Key 8) or Iad-I-as-momar.This was the first after Babalon (Keys 6 and 19) and Telocvovim (19) to strike me as apotential name.Idoigo: “Him that sitteth on the Holy Throne” (Key 19).These are just guesses on a preliminary sortie. There may be others, I’d need to examinehow the sense of the Keys is changed by regarding these and other words as names. Butyou see how I’m looking at it even if the particulars aren’t sorted.

And in the midst of the trees that of Life, in that placewhereon the Lord rests, when he goes up into paradise; and this tree is of ineffablegoodness and fragrance, and adorned more than every existing thing; and on all sides itis in form gold-looking and vermilion and fire-like and covers all, and it has producefrom all fruits.In the Bible this term appears in II Corinthians 12:2, where we find Paul the Apostledescribing probably his own experience of being “caught up in the third heaven”. Fromthe context of the passage the Third Heaven appears to be synonymous with paradise.Dante uses the phrase in canto VIII of the Divine Comedy, Paradiso. Other than thesereferences, the notion of the Third Heaven hardly appears anywhere, so it is interestingseeing it in an Enochian conjuration.Very strange full moon tonight, and now it’s practically dawn and time for me to goslug and snail hunting on my runner-bean patch.JOELThe rock-cutting wormThe name of the rock-cutting worm mentioned above was “Shamir”, it cut stone withits “glance”. In one legend Solomon heard that Asmodeus knew the whereabouts of theworm and forced the demon king to help him locate it. Asmodeus told Solomon thatall the shamirs belonged to the Angel of the Sea who had given the duty of guardingthe worm to moorhens. So Solomon’s helpers placed a glass dome over a moorhen’snest containing a few chicks, forcing the moorhen to fetch a shamir to cut a way in soshe could feed her young. Solomon’s assistants threw dirt on the moorhen, who droppedthe shamir, which Solomon then used to build his temple because the To ra h forbadethe use of iron. Some writers have speculated that the shamir was not a magical wormbut a radioactive substance, such as Immanuel Velikovsky (Kronos, Vol. VI, No. 1, 1980)and Frederic B Jueneman (“The Alchemy of Shamir” in his Essays in Speculative Science)."},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"103“ You’re insane Boris!”—Boris Balkan, mentioned above, is the bibliophile occultistplayed by Frank Langella in Polanski’s brilliant but much misunderstood film The NinthGate, in which the allure of Babalon and the left hand path is depicted, which wentcompletely over the head of many critics who hadn’t a clue who “the girl” was. Althoughshe is presented simply as a dark “guardian angel”, ambiguous as either protector orpredator, her true identity as Babalon is confirmed by the ninth engraving from thefictional book at the heart of the film, De Vmbrarvm Regni Novem Portis or The NineGates of the Kingdom of Shadows, which shows a naked woman bearing a strongresemblance to “the girl” riding a seven-headed dragon, hence she is specifically theGreat Whore of Babylon ie Babalon in occult terms, although even the screenplaydoesn’t spell it out (I haven’t read the novel it was based on, The Club Dumas [El ClubDumas] by Arturo Perez-Reverte). Babalon is played by Polanski’s wife, EmmanuelleSeigner, who was also in Bitter Moon. I was discussing with Satyr the origin of some ofthe engraved plates used in the film; the “hanged man” plate is clearly influenced by thetarot, but I was particularly interested in the engraving of the serpent that features onthe title page of the Novem Portis and is also tattooed on the thigh of the priestess ofThe Order of the Silver Serpent (Liana Telfer played by Lena Olin).

Alas, on viewing the film again the identification is not that close. The Stolcius platefeatures a lion-headed serpent eating its own eagle-headed tail in the shape of thefigure “8” with two faces in the loops which appear to be sun and moon, obviouslyalchemical. The serpent in the film has an extra loop to the “8” and has a straightforwardserpent head and tail, coiled around a tree struck by lightning on the title page, thetattoo being just the snake, but the manner of looping is similar before the Ouroboros-like bite (the word “ouroboros” actually means “tail eater”, one of the earliest being thedepiction in the Chrysopoeia [“Gold Making”] of Cleopatra).As for W F Ryan, I was haphazardly looking through his list of published papersand spotted this little-known gem: “The Great Beast in Russia: Aleister Crowley’sTheatrical Tour in 1913 and his Beastly Writings on Russia” in Arnold McMillin (ed.),Symbolism and After: Essays on Russian Poetry in Honour of Georgette Donchin, Bristol,1992, pp 137–161.JB"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"104Babylon in the words of the prophet IsaiahHi Joel—My conception of Lilith has indeed been tainted by the Zohar. As you sawfrom my email, I was pushing deep into Egypt, and Nephthys, this afternoon. And itbeing Saturday and all, I naturally ended-up considering her Lord Set as well. It wasvery useful, and helped me push past late Jewish characterizations of the Queen of theNight. I’ll get back on the Maqlû material, as I agree on its importance.Believe it or not, I had just had the same realization as you not an hour beforereading: “I had assumed Babylonian texts mentioned her but just realize I don’t know.”Seems this is a pretty hot topic.“Babylon as Rome”, the interpretation favored by modern scholars, seems valid, andquite probably reflects the intent of the editors who stitched together what were, in alllikelihood, a collection of disjoint fragments, assembling them into the coherent wholewe now know as The Revelation of St John. Its saving grace is that these fragmentsappear to be genuine visions, received by one or more persons, in some branch of theSemitic mystery tradition. It contains key images easily traced back into the OldTestament, and beyond.By the time Revelation was written, probably around 95 ce, Babylon had beenabandoned for nearly 400 years. It seems, therefore, unlikely that the metropolis inBabylonia itself is meant when the authors used the word “Babylon”.If we consider Revelation as part of a Jewish tradition, rather than a singular piece ofliterature, we see Babylon, the city and the woman, used as a symbol of opulence,decadence, power and might, in fundamental opposition to Jehovah and his people,that will be overthrown in the day of the wrath of the Almighty. Consider the imagesof Babylon contained in the words of the prophet Isaiah in Isaiah 21:1–10 and Isaiah47. The King of Babylon was likewise the object of Jehovah’s displeasure and proposedwrath, as evidenced by the same prophet in Isaiah 14:3–23.The attentive reader will note the remarkable similarity of several images in thesepassages with others found in Revelation. “John” seems without question to be drawingupon Isaiah for inspiration, mining the symbols used therein and giving them newmeanings in his prophesy of doom and destruction. That “Rome” would now be equatedwith “Babylon” is hardly surprising, since the Second Temple of Jerusalem, rebuilt afterthe Captivity, had been destroyed not 30 years before by Rome in 70 ce.The capture of Jerusalem, destruction of the First Temple, and forced relocation ofthe Jews to Babylonia by Nebuchadnezzar, in 586 bce, is one of the most importantevents of Jewish history.

There isno reason to believe that these ever existed in their accepted form prior to this date. Tothe best of my knowledge of the sources before me, Isaiah is the first to use the name“Babylon” in relation to a woman. To search for antecedents in Mesopotamian mythology,we must look to the etymology of the name itself, and attempt to map its symbolismonto the female deities worshipped since the time of the Sumerians in the land betweenthe rivers.The Babylon of the Old Testament is bbl, in Hebrew, and most likely means, accordingto Gesenius, and others, “the gate (or hall) of Ba’al”, representing a contraction of thetwo words bbh, “cavity”, “aperture”, “gate”, and bol, “to have dominion over”, “to take awife”, or, “lord, master, possessor, owner”. hbol, with the inclusion of the definite article,means “Ba’al”, “Lord”. According to Gesenius (Hebrew and Chaldee Lexicon to the OldTestament Scriptures, p 131), it is “the name of an idol of the Phoenicians, especially ofthe Tyrians: it was their domestic and principal deity, also worshipped with great devotiontogether with Astarte, by the Hebrews, especially in Samaria... Amongst the Babyloniansthe same deity was called in the Aramæan manner bl Belus for bol...”From this it seems apparent that Babylon may be interpreted as the “wife”, or “gate”possessed by the “Lord”. Crowley interpreted babalon to mean “the Gate of the GodOn” (taking “On” in its Egyptian meaning of “the Sun”), and this seems in agreement,more or less, with our investigation so far. The famous “Ishtar Gate” of ancient Babylonimmediately springs to mind, and leads us to ask if Ishtar is perhaps the original nameof the Lady in question. I believe that indeed she is, that it is possible to trace Babylonback to Inanna, the young whore receiving the fruit of the harvest, through Ishtar(often called “Queen of Babylon”) and Beltis, with their cults of prostitution, downthrough derivative practices which prevailed among the Hebrews, after the captivity,until the sack of the Second Temple by Rome in 70 ce. There seems little doubt that ifindeed our Babylon is to be found among the goddesses of the land between the rivers,Inanna, Ishtar, Ashtoreth, by whatever name She was known, is most assuredly thatLady.SATYR[Ed’s note—Astaroth/Ashtoreth was the goddess Astarte/Ashtart before the rabbisinserted the vowels from the word “boshet” into the names of the foreign gods: bOshEt= shame/abomination, so the goddess Ashtart becomes AshtOrEth.

In fact, at the time I was not particularly aware where myfascination with Astaroth came from.This practice of forming denigrating titles and names for deities with lettermanipulation seems to me an intriguing form of magic akin to sigil magic, to literallydemonize. Baal, for instance, is identified with Molech in Jeremiah 19:5: “They havebuilt also the high places of Baal, to burn their sons with fire for burnt offerings untoBaal, which I commanded not, nor spake it, neither came it into my mind.” Molech(also Moloch, although some distinguish the two) was the Ammonite deity, to whomchildren were sacrificed in fire, but some scholars believe that it is not actually a propername at all but is derived by combining the consonants from the Hebrew word for“king” (mlk) with the vowels of the word for “shame” (boshet), thus “King of Shame”.]AGLA on the back of the Sigillum Dei ÆmethHi Joel—I’m well aware of agla on the back of the Sigillum, but I don’t recall nowwhether it even crossed my mind when I composed the notes on “Jubalcain”. Honestyprompts me to I say it didn’t. That we weren’t, at that time, actively addressing Enochianissues might be a good excuse, but little more than that.The word agla appears on two sigilla actually, Dee’s and another found in LiberJuratus, more commonly known as The Sworne Booke of Honorius. Daniel J Driscoll,editor and translator of the first printed edition, was of the opinion this other sourcewas composed no later than the year 1311 [The Sworn Book of Honourius (sic) theMagician. Gillette, New Jersey: Heptangle Books, 1983. p xviii]. This is as may be, butit at least admits the possibility that a nearly identical symbol was used on a similar sigil(Ibid, p 10, here called the “Sigil of God”, as opposed to Dee’s “Sigil of God’s Truth”).This earlier version is described and illustrated in Sloane ms. 313, which itself may bethe oldest grimoire found in the British Museum’s collection (Driscoll, p xi). Moreover,in one of the prayers in Honorius, one with a great litany of names divine, agla headsthe list (Ibid, “The 100 Names of God”, p 14). We certainly can’t rule out the possibilitythat Uriel, Kelly, Dee, or all three were aware of its prior existence in the literatureavailable at the time, and drew on that source. In fact, the archangel specifically instructedDee he would find the Sigillum Dei perfected in a book already in his possession (Sloane"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"107ms. 3677, fol. 14r—giving my eyes a break for the moment, and citing Ashmole’stranscription instead of the original). Dee later implies (Ibid, fol. 18) he found multipledesigns in his library, and wondered how they might be compared or combined in orderto arrive at one best suited to the divine purpose.The repetition of some material attributed to Agrippa is certainly one other instanceof such “borrowing”, on someone’s part. Noted references to other authors in the “LibriMysteriorum” seem to indicate Dee had extensive knowledge of previous work in thefield.agla written between the arms of a cross appears to be an apt symbol of “Earth”,and therefore it makes some sense that it would be placed on the bottom, or undersideof the Sigillum. But that is a modern interpretation, based upon Golden Dawn usage ofagla. David Jones was of the opinion that “The Sigil of God” was an obvious precursorof “The Sigil of God’s Truth”.Good to hear of your slug hunting: hope you were successful.

Even theidentity of the Beast 666 is far more ambiguous than generally realised, Aleister Crowleymay have got the wrong beast if he wanted the one the Great Whore of Babylon wasriding (hereinafter Babalon). And even the number may be wrong. And the more onelooks the more the identities of Lucifer, Satan, the Great Red Dragon, and the serpentbecome indistinct and related by strange connections to such Enochian entities as theStooping Dragon, Telocvovim (the Death Dragon), and John Dee’s demon Coronzon(Choronzon to Crowley).First off notice that the Great Red Dragon of Revelation 12:3, who wants to devourthe pregnant woman’s child, has seven heads and ten horns, perhaps identifying himwith Babalon’s beast, although the red dragon has seven crowns upon his heads unlikethe ten crowns of the beast that rises up out of the sea in 13:1, which, though it has theseven heads and the ten horns is distinctly undragon-like, looking like a leopard with abear’s feet and lion’s mouth. Babalon’s beast in 17:3 is “scarlet coloured” and has sevenheads and ten horns, no mention of how many crowns, if any. The red dragon in 12:9 isdescribed as the ancient snake, who is called the Devil and Satan, and there was war inHeaven with Michael and his angels fighting against the dragon (12:7). So it’s intriguingthat Telocvovim in the 19th Enochian Key, for whom Babalon’s bed is his dwellingplace, is translated as “Him that is fallen”, suggesting Lucifer, and yet this name inEnochian appears to be a contraction of two separate words, “death” (teloch, TELOCH,used in Keys 3, 8, 11) + “dragon” (vovin, VOVIN, two variant forms in the 8th Key)."},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"110In Revelation 13:4 the dragon is said to give power to the beast, this is the seven-headed, ten-horned, ten-crowned leopard-bear-lion beast, which seems to indicate theyare to be regarded as two separate creatures, as William Blake painted them in his “TheGreat Red Dragon and the Beast from the Sea” (c. 1805, in the National Gallery of Art,Washington, dc). Babalon’s beast is never described as a dragon, but the scarlet colourseems to link it with the red dragon. And, to confuse matters still further, after theseven-headed, ten-horned, ten-crowned beast rises up out of the sea in 13:1 anotherbeast comes up out of the earth in 13:11 and this one has two horns like a lamb andspeaks like a dragon, and—although it’s ambiguous—it’s this beast that seems to be666 in 13:18 (these two beasts were illustrated together in a woodcut by Albrecht Dürer).So, “The Beast 666” doesn’t appear to be the same beast that Babalon rides. AleisterCrowley in Chapter 49 of the Book of Lies indicates that it is the seven-headed beastthat Babalon rides that he “frankly identifies himself with”, yet it is far from clear thatBabalon’s beast should necessarily be construed as “The Beast 666”, nor is it clear whetherthe Beast 666 is a two-horned lamb with a dragon’s voice from the earth or a seven-headed ten-horned leopard-bear-lion beast from the sea, although it is definitely oneor the other. And as if that wasn’t enough, we may have to revise our idea that thenumber of the Beast is 666. The Oxyrhynchus Papyri, which contains a fragmentarypapyrus of Revelation that is the earliest known (late third / early fourth century), givesthe number of the Beast as 616 [P.Oxy. LVI 4499]. Irenæus had previously cited andrefuted this number. The Greek word used for “beast” in Revelation, incidentally, istherion (qhrion), hence Crowley as “The Master Therion” and “To Mega Therion”, theGreat Beast.To summarise and gather as much clarity as possible so far from John’s bizarre accountof his revelation: Babalon’s beast, though seven-headed and ten-horned, could be oneof two seven-headed ten-horned beasts, one being the Great Red Dragon Michaelfights that has seven crowns on those heads, the other being the leopard-bear-lionbeast from the sea with ten crowns on those heads. Babalon’s beast, however, is scarlet-coloured, like the Great Red Dragon, which we know for certain is not the Beast 666.Perhaps it is a mistake to expect to be able to distil clarity from a phantasmagorichallucination, nonetheless this image of Babalon—the Great Whore, the ScarletWoman—riding the Beast represents for occultists a profound sexual mystery quiteapart from such notions read into Revelation of “fornication” being a metaphor forworshipping other gods and “Babylon” as really being merely a guarded reference toRome. In John’s vision the word that interests me the most used to describe Babalon is“Mystery”, in the Greek musterion (musthrion), a derivative of muo (muw), “to shutthe mouth”, hence a secret or “mystery”, which, according to Strong’s Dictionary, comes"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"111from the idea of silence imposed by initiation into religious rites. In my experience thetrue understanding of the mystery of Babalon comes essentially from occult initiation(on “the prayer mats of the flesh” you might say, to borrow the title of the Chineseerotic novel by Li Yu).Just as “Babylon the Great” is generally regarded by Biblical commentators as Rome,so is the beast with seven heads and ten horns—Rome stood on seven hills and theRoman empire was divided into ten provinces by Augustus Caesar. But I’m not convincedthat this “reasonable” way to look at it is the only or the best way. How does seeing thebeast as Rome help, because, following this line of reasoning, so is the Great Red Dragon,who Michael fights as Satan. Why should the beast that rose up out of the sea andBabalon’s beast be identified as Rome but the Great Red Dragon be regarded as Satan?More importantly—and this is a question left unaddressed by those who seek to “explain”Revelation—if the text is properly understood as a carefully constructed allegory doesthis not undermine its status as genuine visionary experience, as a “revelation” fromGod?The idea of the seven-headed serpent or dragon is much earlier than the Bible, itappears to have emerged from Babylonia—where it is mentioned in Old Babylonianlists and omens—from even earlier precedents. The seven-headed serpent is mentionedin the epic Andimdimma where it is compared with the weapon of the god Ninurta (seeLandsberger, Die Fauna des alten Mesopotamien [Leipzig, 1934], p 60). A seven-headedserpent is also found on a Sumerian macehead; a seal dating back to the middle of thethird millennium bc from Tell Asmar (ancient Eshnunna), 50 miles northeast of modernBaghdad, shows the slaying of a dragon with seven heads (both are illustrated inAlexander Heidel’s The Babylonian Genesis [1951], figures 15 and 16). In Psalms 74:14“the heads of Leviathan” are mentioned, and Isaiah 27:1 has a reference to Leviathanthat strongly parallels a reference to the seven-headed dragon or serpent Lotan fromUgaritic mythology mentioned on a tablet from Ras Shamra. Lotan was slain by Baal.In Isaiah 27:1 it is written, in Heidel’s translation:“On that day the Lord will punishWith his sword, which is hard and great and strong,Leviathan, the fleeing serpent,And Leviathan, the tortuous serpent,And he will slay the crocodile (tannin) that is in the sea.”[Heidel, The Babylonian Genesis, p 103]The King James version has “dragon (tannin) that is in the sea” but Heidel sees it as acrocodile in the Nile (the Nile is referred to as “the Sea” in Isa. 19:5 and Nah. 3:8 and is"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"112today called el-Bahr, “the Sea”, by Arabs). The fourteenth century bc Ras Shamra tabletswere discovered in 1928 on the site of the ancient north Syrian city of Ugarit (RasShamra), excavated from a temple dedicated to Baal, and on one of these tablets is aninscription describing a battle scene in which one deity addresses another:“When thou shalt smite Lotan, the fleeing serpent,(And) shall put an end to the tortuous serpent,Shalyat of the seven heads. . . . .”[Ibid, p 107]“Shalyat” is an epithet of Lotan. Leviathan in Job 41 becomes completely demythologisedand now only has one head—the riddle-like description there is generally understoodto be of a crocodile. (Note that there is no real evidence that the so-called “chaos dragon”Tiamat of the Enuma Elish was actually a dragon, or that she is related to the Hebrewword tehom, rendered as “the deep” in Genesis 1:2.)Turning to the 8th Enochian Key, I have become fascinated by the reference to the“Stooping Dragon”:The midday, the first, is as the third heaven made of Hyacinth Pillars—26—in whomeThe Elders are become strong, which I have prepared for my own righteousness sayeththe Lord whose long contynuance shall be as bucklers to the stooping Dragon and likeunto the harvest of a wyddow. How many are there which remain in the glorie of theearth which are and shall not see death until this howse fall and the Dragon sink? Comeaway, for the Thunders have spoken. Come away, for the Crownes of the Temple, andthe coat of him that is, was, and shall be crowned, are divided. Come Appeare to theterror of the earth and to our cumfort and of such as are prepared.A “buckler” is “a small shield used for parrying” and, in this context, “stoop” means “toswoop down, as a bird of prey”. Presumably then, given the Apocalyptic tone of theEnochian Keys, the Stooping Dragon is the Great Red Dragon of Revelation.Both Crowley and Kenneth Grant refer to the Stooping Dragon a number of times.Crowley, for instance, regards the Stooping Dragon as apparently being the equivalentof Apophis in “The Temple of Solomon the King”, The Equinox Vol. I, No. II, where inaddition Austin Osman Spare’s diagram of The Fall is reproduced showing an eight-headed dragon/serpent (also plate 1 in Kenneth Grant’s Nightside of Eden). See inaddition the reference in the 30th Æthyr of The Vision and the Voice: “Come thou, whoart joined with me to bruise the Dragon’s head.” A footnote explains that this is areference to the Stooping Dragon. In Crowley’s 7th Æthyr the Stooping Dragon “raised"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"113his head unto Daäth”, there was an explosion, his head was blasted, and the ashes weredispersed throughout the 10th Æthyr. And the phrase “The Piercing of the Coils of theStooping Dragon” appears in The Rite of Mercury, which in Liber Israfel is given as “ThePiercing of the Scales of the Crocodile”. None of this is graced with the merest glimmerof explanation. There are echoes in Isaiah 51:9 in the cutting of Rahab and the piercingof the “dragon” (King James), represented by the word tannin, which Heidel againsuggests should here be taken as “crocodile”, although it should be pointed out that theterm tannin also occurs in the Ras Shamra tablets where it is equated with “Shalyat ofthe seven heads”. (Absorption of a mythical monster into an ordinary creature alsooccurs in Chinese literature, where the river dragon Chiao is later demythologised andseen as a crocodile.) In Job 26:12–13 there is a curious mention of the “fleeing serpent”or “crooked serpent” that in the King James version disguises a further reference to thename Rahab by translating “he smiteth Rahab” as “he smiteth through the proud”.Alexander Heidel provides a convincing argument to show that Rahab, besides being adesignation of Egypt, is synonymous with Leviathan (The Babylonian Genesis, pp 102–114; coincidentally Rahab is the name of a harlot in Joshua 2:1–7 and 6:17–25), whichin turn appears to have been the seven-headed serpent Lotan, although clearly we seein the various references the crumbling away of the original legendary material, andthat process of mythic erosion is further continued in the references to fabulous ophidianbeings in Revelation. And curiously enough we can see a similar process at work in theemergence of the “Stooping Dragon” via the skrying of Kelly and Dee which is furtherelaborated in Crowley’s skrying of the Æthyrs in terms of an explosion of a dragon’shead in Daäth with the debris being scattered in the 10th Æthyr and the creation of themodern demon Choronzon.Straining my own credulity somewhat, could the dragon’s exploding head explainhow Austin Spare’s curious eight-headed dragon, one of the heads being shown inDaäth being hit by the lightning bolt, became the seven-headed dragon of Revelation?Kenneth Grant, in Nightside of Eden, is similarly obscure. On p 8 he says that Daäth is“the Eighth Head of the Stooping Dragon, raised up when the Tree of Life was shatteredand Macroprosopus set a flaming sword against Microprosopus”. On p 43 Grant explains(I use the word loosely): “The Dragon whose eighth head reigns in Daäth is identicalwith the Beast 666. The male half is Shugal (333), the howler in the Desert of Set; thefemale half is Choronzon (333) or Typhon, the prototype of Babalon, the ScarletWoman.” There are further obscurities on the eight-headed dragon on pages 56 and 81(“...blah blah Lovecraft... blah blah Cthulhu... blah blah Tunnels of Set...”).Well, there is undoubtedly something of interest in all of this, but the thing I findodd about both Crowley’s and Grant’s mentions of the Stooping Dragon is that they"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"114appear to assume that this has some meaning to the reader and yet neither actually referthe phrase back to what appears to be its only genuine occurrence, namely in the 8thEnochian Key received by Dee and Kelly. Now it could be that they took this knowledgefor granted, but the fact remains that they went on to use the phrase in what to me is anobscurantist fashion and I am not convinced their obfuscations shed a great deal oflight on the use of the term in the 8th Key. In a note on his skrying of the 10th ÆthyrCrowley says: “The doctrine of the ‘Fall’ and the ‘Stooping Dragon’ must be studiedcarefully.” I am inclined to think this is in the nature of a marginal reminder to himselfto do just that some time. But he is certainly right that these ideas have a great bearingon the question of the Abyss.The Dweller in the Abyss, Choronzon, comes in two spellings. Coronzon is theoriginal spelling of John Dee and Edward Kelly, Choronzon is the “corrected” spellingby Aleister Crowley that adds up to 333 (actually churunzun, ie }wznwrwx). In The Visionand the Voice (Liber 418) Crowley was specifically told that the number of Choronzonwas 333 in his skrying of the 10th Æthyr. Yet he obviously already knew this because heused the spelling in the previously skryed Æthyrs 17, 15, 12, and 11. The 17th wasskryed on Dec 2, 1909, and the 10th on Dec 6. So far as I am aware, The Vision and theVoice, published in 1911, was the first time Crowley ever wrote about Choronzon, Liber333 (The Book of Lies) was published in 1913 (note Chapter 42, “Dust-Devils”). Heshows that he was aware of the original spelling of Dee and Kelly because like them herefers to the demon as “that mighty devil”. In the 28th Æthyr Crowley received what heregarded later as a prophecy concerning his experience of Choronzon in the 10th: “Thoushalt be vexed by dispersion.” Dispersion also adds up to 333 in Greek (a)kolasia).In the 10th Æthyr it is even stated explicitly: “Choronzon is Dispersion.” Yet in a footnoteCrowley claims not to have realised at the time that there was any correspondencebetween “Dispersion” and “Choronzon”. Dee’s spelling of “Coronzon” adds up to 345in Hebrew (Donald Tyson gets 365 by taking Nun final as 70). So why exactly didCrowley change the spelling from Dee’s original before he was told the demon’s numberin the 10th, if not because he wished to link Choronzon to the forewarning of beingvexed by dispersion mentioned in the 28th, and present the demon as responsible formental scattering and distraction. Did he perhaps, either consciously or subconsciously,desire to have his change legitimised and this is why he had the demon state its number?It’s fascinating that the spelling “Choronzon” is already in use before the 10th Æthyr butthe “Babalon” spelling is not, Crowley was still spelling her name “Babylon”, and it is inthe 10th Æthyr that he first uses the correct spelling alluded to in the 12th Æthyr (in thephrase “Gate of the God On” }(l)b)b, ie Babalon: bab b)b = gate; al l) = God; on}( = On) where it becomes representative of a “victory over Choronzon” and mark of"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"115the banishment of illusion. (Of course, if we regard C[h]oronzon and Babalon asessentially Enochian words, their numbers 333 and 156 when rendered in Hebrew areirrelevant and merely a curiosity.)The account of the skrying of the 10th Æthyr was unusual among the 30 Æthyrs inthat it was subjected to editing and revision. It states in the published version in TheVision and the Voice:This cry was obtained on Dec 6, 1909, between 2 and 4.15 pm, in a lonely valley of finesand, in the desert near Bou-Saada. The Æthyr was edited and revised on the followingday.The original account penned at the time was in fact torn out of the ms. notebook,according to an editorial note in the 1998 Weiser edition (p 159 n1 and p 170 n3) . Ihave often wondered why exactly that was. And why, indeed, was this Æthyr edited andrevised? What was the nature of this revision? Crowley doesn’t say, and the torn-outpages are now apparently lost. Was it simply to create a more ordered account out of thechaotic events of the operation, with bracketed explanations, or was there another reason?Although the demon “Coronzon” does not appear in the Enochian of the 19 Keysand so is not therefore strictly an Enochian word, as implied by Donald Tyson whobelieves it is Enochian for Lucifer, nonetheless this entity was named to Dee and Kellyon one occasion. (Laycock also lists Coronzon as an Enochian word in The CompleteEnochian Dictionary.) The passage naming Coronzon is found in the Cotton AppendixXLVI, “Mensis Mysticus Saobaticus, Pars prima ejudem”. The dialogue took place onApril 21, 1584, and is between Edward Kelly, John Dee, and the Archangel Gabriel, onthe topic of the Angelic Tongue, now called Enochian. Kelly asked whether Angelicwas known in any part of the world, or not. Gabriel answered that “Coronzon (for so isthe true name of that mighty Devil)” envied the status of man in the eyes of God and sobegan to assail him. Coronzon prevailed with the result that man lost “the Garden ofFelicity” and was “driven forth (as your Scriptures record) unto the Earth which wascovered with brambles...”. And as a result of that so too was the Angelic languagespoken by Adam in his innocence also lost. (This episode naming Coronzon is recordedin Meric Casaubon’s A True and Faithful Relation of what passed for many Yeers BetweenDr John Dee ... and some Spirits, pp 92–93. The Enochian Keys themselves were receivedover the period from April 13 to July 13, 1584, at Cracow. Causabon’s title “A True andFaithful...” could be an allusion to Revelation 21:5.)So far as I have been able to ascertain, the demon Coronzon does not appear in priorliterature. If we put aside for one moment the popular conception of what happened in"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"116“the Garden of Felicity”, and do not rush to the conclusion that Coronzon is necessarilyto be identified with the serpent of the Garden of Eden, Satan, or Lucifer—themselvesconflated—we are left on reading the passage in isolation with “the true name of thatmighty Devil” who appears to have been responsible for the loss of the Angelic language,the “tongue of power”, to humanity. The serpent in Genesis 3 is neither named as Satanthere nor said to be Satan’s instrument, this is an interpretation. The serpent in Gen 3:1is described as “more subtil than any beast of the field”. The “beasts of the field” is aphrase that occurs in the 19th Key represented by the Enochian word Levithmong(LEVITHMONG) and also appears in the “Daughter of Fortitude” passage. I pointthis out only to emphasise the resonances of the language used. Even in the NewTestament the identification of the serpent of the Garden of Eden as Satan is not decisive:in 2 Corinthians 11:3 it is said that “the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtilty” butstill does not name the serpent as Satan and Revelation 12:9 mentions “...that oldserpent, called the Devil, and Satan...”, a sentiment repeated in Rev 20:2, but the serpentis not mentioned explicitly in the context of the Garden of Eden, although presumablythis is the implication. Matthew 10:16 even advocates that one should take after theserpent: “be ye therefore wise as serpents”. The Gnostic text The Testimony of Truthdiscovered at Nag Hammadi in 1945 is particularly interesting here in that it tells thestory of the Garden of Eden from the point of view of the wise serpent who denouncesGod as a “malicious grudger” for refusing Adam gnosis, and also mocks God as lackingin omniscience since he had to ask where Adam was when he hid from him (Genesis3:8–9). The text also equates the bronze serpent made by Moses in Numbers 21:9 withChrist. (The papyrus of the Nag Hammadi texts date to about ad 350–400, althoughthe texts themselves may date to ad 120–150.) The conception of the Serpent as theTrue Redeemer is nothing new to occultists, and was touched on in Martin Scorsese’s1988 film The Last Temptation of Christ (the number 358 has a few occultists overlyexcited, because mshich or mâshîyach [xy$m], “Messiah”, and nchsh or nâchâsh [$xn],the “Serpent” of Genesis, both add up to 358 by gematria). Given that the Bible itself ishardly definitive in establishing the serpent of the Garden as Satan, how much more soshould we be wary of blithely associating Coronzon as revealed to Dee and Kelly withSatan or Lucifer. Although Dee and Kelly undoubtedly brought their own assumptionsand dogmas to the Work, it is probably better to regard the Enochian revelations as adirect angelic communication aimed at establishing a fresh picture of the Fall of Manand as far as possible avoid contaminating it by previously held ideas.Most people who have looked at this passage in Casaubon have indeed too readilyidentified Dee’s Coronzon as Lucifer/Satan, and also as the Stooping Dragon giventhat the Great Red Dragon of Revelation 12 is there said to be the Devil, Satan, and"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"117“that old serpent”. Indeed, Crowley in the 3rd Æthyr says that Choronzon’s head is“raised unto Daäth”, thereby explicitly identifying Choronzon with his previouscharacterisation of the Stooping Dragon in the 7th Æthyr, which raises its head untoDaäth where it is blasted (the ashes being spread in the 10th, Choronzon’s domain),which links to Spare’s eight-headed dragon with one head in Daäth and then to aseven-headed dragon and then full circle to the Great Red Dragon of Revelation andagain Satan and the serpent and the even earlier Lotan and Leviathan. In the 10thÆthyr Crowley (as Choronzon) also says: “Is not the head of the great Serpent ariseninto Knowledge?” Knowledge (gnosis) being Daäth, this shows Crowley made littledistinction between the Stooping Dragon, the Serpent, and Choronzon—or even that“Choronzon” identifies himself as the Serpent if the whole is taken together as a trulychannelled work without any contamination by Crowley’s own concerns. (The dull-minded like to believe that human beings have no creative part to play in genuine spiritcommunication beyond reception. Anyone who has skryed will know, however, if theyhave not come away from the experience deluded by whatever entities they have beentrafficking with, that what results is a blend of information already known—orderedmore lucidly and coherently—with the inclusion of genuinely new material that emergeswith the tacit acceptance that the whole be regarded as a communication from spirits.)Some, such as Geoffrey James, have even identified Telocvovim (“Him that is fallen”,literally “Death Dragon”) of the 19th Key as Coronzon rather than Lucifer (there is notext referring to Coronzon’s fall), going so far as to refer to Telocvovim as “the greatdragon Coronzon”. I believe all these identifications of C[h]oronzon are in errorinasmuch as they are made too easily without taking into account the complexity of thematrix of mythic material out of which the demon emerged. Instead it is instructive tolook more closely at the serpent of Genesis, given that the serpent alone, set apart fromlater interpretations of who or what the serpent was actually supposed to be apart froma persuasive snake, is as much as we are entitled to draw into our correlation on thebasis of the skrying of Dee and Kelly, where Coronzon as such was born into thisworld. The Greek word used for “serpent” in Revelation is ophis (ofij), which simplymeans a snake or serpent, and, ostensibly because of the reference in Revelation, theword also means Satan. In Genesis, however, the Hebrew word nâchâsh ($xn) is used,which, according to Strong’s Dictionary (entry 5175) means “a snake (from its hiss):—serpent”, but Strong’s points out that the word is derived from nâchash 5172: “a primitiveroot; properly, to hiss, ie whisper a (magic) spell; generally, to prognosticate”. Similarly,nachash 5173, also derived from 5172, means: “an incantation or augury:—enchantment”.So, the “serpent” is already starting to look much more interesting, as a sibilant magicalincantation, or serpent magic. Job 3:8 also appears to contain a cryptic allusion to a"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"118magical evocation when it speaks of those “who are skilful to rouse up Leviathan” (thepresence of the name Leviathan is hidden in the King James version, where it is translatedas “mourning”). I am inclined to think of Coronzon as something evoked or invoked,although not necessarily an entity. In Crowley’s Confessions, interestingly enough, oneof the transmogrifying illusory forms Choronzon took as witnessed by the scribe VictorNeuburg, besides a woman he was once in love with, was a human-headed serpent.Choronzon appeared to exert a powerfully disorientating phantasmagoria, as if thiswas all Choronzon was, which was quelled and died down and was known to be gonewhen Crowley wrote the name of Babalon, for the first time spelt this way, in the sandwith his ring. As Crowley noted:The name of the Dweller in the Abyss is Choronzon, but he is not really an individual.The Abyss is empty of being; it is filled with all possible forms, each equally inane, eachtherefore evil in the only true sense of the word—that is, meaningless but malignant,insofar as it craves to become real. [Confessions, p 623]Not Lucifer, not Satan, not the Stooping Dragon, nor even Lilith the only true serpentin the Garden, usually represented in medieval Books of Hours as a human-headedserpent; Crowley’s skrying of the 10th Æthyr does not read like an encounter with anidentifiable entity so much as an enchantment engulfing both participants who discoverwhen it is over, banished “In Nomine Babalon”, that they have been wrestling with thinair. This picture of Choronzon is to me much more fascinating and profound thanmaking him a cardboard cut-out Satan in some illusory Apocalyptic drama craving tobe real just as were mere dust devils in the desert to Crowley in the name of Choronzon.This is indeed why to cross the Abyss is to come face to face with Choronzon, for weare fully everything we are fooled into believing is real, though it changes before oureyes constantly. The irony is that few things seem more real than Choronzon whenencountered, or as illusory when the ordeal passes, like a storm that has decidedly movedon.“ Thou didst shatter the heads of Leviathan, thou didst givehim as food to the desert dwellers.”Psalms 74:14."},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"119CorrespondenceHow did Crowley know the 10th Æthyr wasaccursèd before he skryed it?Satyr—How the hell did Crowley know that Choronzon was associated with the 10thÆthyr before he skryed it? Nothing in the governors of the Æthyr to suggest that norin the name of the Aire, zax (ZAX). Why did he prepare to call Choronzon? If one isgoing to skry the 30 Æthyrs this poses a question: should one also regard the 10th as theabode of Choronzon and take similar precautions?Crowley begins his preamble to the 10th: “This Æthyr, being accursèd, and the seerforewarned...” And so he prepared the Circle and Triangle of Art for protection anddemonic constraint, cut the throats of three pigeons as sacrificial victims and let theirblood pour within the three angles of the triangle in which he sat as Seer, not recitingthe Call of the Æthyr until the sand had soaked up their blood. He tooled up Neuburgas Scribe in the circle with a Magick Dagger with strict instructions on oath that heshould not hesitate to strike fearlessly at anything that may break through the circle,even should it have “the appearance of the Seer himself ”, Crowley possessed byChoronzon in other words, which actually happened. Major precautions, he clearlyknew what to expect if we are to believe that the Æthyr was actually skryed in themanner depicted in the published report (the pages being torn out of the ms. notebookand the stated editing and revision of this Æthyr the following day may suggest creativereworking of what actually happened).Taking it at face value, which is how I would far prefer to believe it actually happened,how then did Crowley know the Æthyr was accursèd beforehand, when and how washe forewarned? Choronzon is mentioned in the 11th, but not necessarily in such a wayas to suggest the 10th was therefore all about Choronzon. Crowley also says that the10th is accursèd in the 22nd Æthyr, although without mentioning Choronzon. Workingwith just the Dee material, and not Crowley’s, would I assume the 10th is associated this"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"120way and perceive such a forewarning in the original source material? This seems asimple question that has been overlooked, unless I’m missing something equally asobvious. Could Crowley’s linkage of Choronzon to this Æthyr be a not necessarilyhelpful preconception for someone approaching the 10th anew today?JOELHi Joel—I must say that I disagree with your statement, “Choronzon is mentioned inthe 11th, but not necessarily in such a way as to suggest the 10th was therefore all aboutChoronzon.” In the 11th we read:And I said unto the Angel:Is there not one appointed as a warden?And he said:Eloi, Eloi, lama sabacthani.That the 11th is the last bastion set against the malice of Mr C seems obvious to me,given its description and the message of its Angel, and the answer to Crowley’s question,above, strongly implies that the 10th is Choronzon, and little if anything else. EachÆthyr had a guardian, or warden, as he worked his way up. When the Angel answerswith the words of Jesus, as he hung upon the cross, “My God, my God, why hast thouforsaken me?” [Mark 15:34] it seems to suggest a definite “No” to Crowley’s inquiry,though it isn’t stated quite so explicitly.Jones never questioned the nature of the 10th, nor did I, and I agree that looking atthe Dee material it is not obvious to the casual observer that anything might be amissthere, compared with the other Æthyrs. But on closer examination, I think, we areforced to admit that something is different about it.Look at an illustration of Dee’s “Great Table” [Turner, Robert, Elizabethan Magic,p 59. See also James, Geoffrey, The Enochian Evocation of Dr John Dee, p 117; BritishMuseum, Sloane ms. 3191, fols. 56v–57r; and others] and compare it with that of “The91 Symmetrical Characters” [Turner, p 61. See also James, p 116; Sloane ms. 3191, fols.49v–50r; and others]. Both were received on the same day, in the same action of 25 June,1584 [Casaubon, Meric (ed.), A True and Faithful Relation of what passed for many YeersBetween Dr John Dee ... and some Spirits, pp 172–178], and curiously enough, the latterwas shown Kelly, and recorded by him, before the former. The symmetrical charactersare sigils of what are often called the Governors of the 30 Æthyrs (though this issomething of a misnomer). The name of each of these 91 Governors may be found"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"121listed in Col. III of Dee’s “Liber Scientiæ, Auxilii, et Victoriæ Terrestris” [Sloane ms.3191, fols. 16v–31r; Turner, pp 50–57; and others]. Looking closely at “The 91Symmetrical Characters” as they appear on the Great Table, you will see that most ofthe figures, but not all, are made up of six segments each, drawn from the center of onesquare to the next, encompassing seven squares in all. After 88 of these seven-squaresigils have been positioned upon the table, there remain eight squares left over. Six ofthese squares are paired, with one segment between them, and two squares are apparentlya part of no sigil at all. By noting the positions of these orphaned squares on the GreatTable, we find that the corresponding letters are drawn backwards when possible, andare found by comparison to be AO, N, L, RA [Turner, p 59, is incorrect here, his GreatTable exhibiting “OA” instead of “RA”. James, p 117, agrees with Dee’s Great Table,Sloane ms. 3191, fol. 57r], and PA. Seven of these eight letters, when arranged in theirproper order, form the name Paraoan, the name of #65, the 2nd Governor of the 22ndÆthyr. Dee is instructed to perform this same exercise in an operation on 26 June,1584, the day after receiving the tables [Casaubon, p 179].There remains one letter of our original eight, the backward “L”, which has yet to beincluded in the name of any Governor. Immediately after the angels explained to Deethe manner in which Paraoan is obtained, he was instructed to take the letters of thethree Governors of the 10th Æthyr, Lexarph, Comanan, Tabitom, and leaving off theinitial “L” of the first name, write the remaining 20 letters in tabular form, left to right,in four rows of five letters each. These were then to be placed in a particular manner“without the first Table” [Ibid], to form a large cross in the center of “The Great Table”.This cross serves to bind the four quadrants together, as Ave explains, and Dee refers toit on occasion as the “crosse of union”. Indeed, those who developed the Enochianmaterial used by the Golden Dawn called the above table of twenty squares the “Tabletof Union”, employing it in that Order’s “Portal” ritual, the bridge between the Innerand Outer orders, and its formula is central to the Inner Order RR et AC’s “Consecrationof the Vault of the Adepts”, arguably their most important ceremony. The same table isfound in the Golden Dawn Cypher Manuscript [fol. 54]. Kelly suffered a migraine, towhich he appears to have been prone, during the reception of this material, and whenhe became convinced that the angel Ave mocked his pain, Dee reports “A greattemptation fell on E.K.” [Casaubon, p 179]. Though little of what transpired occurs inthe record at this point, it appears from a later description that Kelly’s temptation tookthe form of frightful curses of not only Ave, but Michael, Gabriel, and the heavenlypowers in general [Ibid, p 183].In Dee’s diagrams, the “crosse of union” was generally drawn in solid black [Sloanems. 3191, fols. 49v–50r, 53v–54r, 56v–57r], and in a marginal note he refers to it as the"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"122“black crosse” [Casaubon, p 180], and more fully on at least one occasion as “the wickedtheir black Crosse” [Ibid, p 184]. This was in part due to one of its principal uses, asexplained by Ave. On each of the four tablets that make up the Great Table are fourCalvary crosses consisting of ten squares. Beneath the horizontal arms of each are sixteensquares (sometimes referred to in modern practice as “the lesser squares”), arranged infour rows of two squares each on either side of the lower vertical portion of the cross. Asingle letter of the “black crosse” stands on the same line as each of these pairs, andwhen prefixed to any of these two letter combinations, “the name of a Devil, or wickedAngel” is formed [Ibid, p 180]. Kelly’s headache and subsequent outburst over theperceived scoff of Ave may be more significant than at first appears. It occurs immediatelyafter the discussion of the “black crosse”, formed from the names of the three Governorsof the 10th Æthyr, and their assembly into the “Tablet of Union”. We are told somewhatmore of this incident in an entry later this same day, as noted above, where Kelly statesthat he believes that his behavior was the work of the Devil, whereupon the angel Avereappears, declaring this indeed to have been the case [Ibid, p 183].Dee suspected that some mystery was implied in constructing the “black crosse”from the Governors of the 10th Æthyr, and said as much to the angel when the actionresumed [Ibid]. Ave evaded his concerns, and added to the confusion by explainingthat the “L aversed”, which was explicitly stated to be the first letter of Lexarph, mayalso be an “N”, and adds:...

[Ibid. This last appears to refer to the opening of the Sixth Seal, Revelation6:12–17]It is interesting to observe that though Lexarph is the Governor of the region “Caspia”,the Governor following, Comanan, is the Governor of “Germania”, which, at least inpart, includes those lands belonging to Emperor Rudolf (whom Dee notes as being the“Caesar” of whom it is spoken in the prophesy, indeed the ruler to whom he had beencommanded to address the message of the angels).The attentive student of history will note that the Thirty Years War began inGermania, about twelve years after the death of Dee, or less than thirty-seven yearsafter the prophesy, and resulted in one of the most significant “alterations” in European"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"123politics of that age. Personally, I might even be so bold as to note that a few decadesafter Crowley opened the Æthyrs in North Africa, this same region once again was thescene of a phenomenal amount of fire and bloodshed. This time however, the timeelapsed was only thirty years.The above discussion of whether the “L” of Lexarph might be an “N” seems to havecaused Dee some difficulty, as later in a subsequent action with Ave he appears toconfound this “N” with that found in Paraoan. The angel proceeds as if Dee is correct,saying, “Every letter in Paraoan, is a living fire: but all of one quality and of one Creation:But unto N is delivered a viol of Destruction, according to that part that he is of Paraoanthe Governour.” [Ibid, p 188]In preparing this, I am reminded that I have already sent you a discussion of theapparent nature of the Watchtowers, in a previous email regarding Coronzon. Ratherthan repeat information that by now has become familiar, I will limit myself to a briefsummary, for ease of reference.The Devils, or wicked Angels, whose names are formed using letters from the blackcrosse, are not the sole entities of a questionable nature associated with the Watchtowers.In the vision heralding the reception of this portion of the angelic system, Kelly behelda multitude of spirits that were not included in Ave’s subsequent exposition. WhenDee asked what they were, the angel answered, “They be Ministers and servants...There shalt thou see thy old Sondenna [a demon of Kelly’s acquaintance—Ed], andmany other wicked ones, that thou hast dealt withall. Hereby shall you judge truly ofwicked Magick.” [Ibid, pp 184–185] A curious statement in its own right, and evenmore so when coming from one of God, his Holy Creatures.Some days after the Watchtower material was recorded, during the reception of the19th Call or Key, a pause occurs in the action, immediately after receiving that portionwhich reads (in English translation), “The reasonable Creatures of the earth, or Man.Let them vex and weed out one another.” An unidentified voice proceeds to explainthat because of the transgression and fall of Adam, the Earth was accursèd for his sake,and “Keepers, Watch-men, and Princes” were set over her [Ibid, p 205]. As is too oftenthe case, the statement appears more than a little ambiguous, but it appears to refer tothe various spirits found in the Watchtowers, implying that in at least some cases theyfunction somewhat like prison guards. Though it isn’t stated explicitly, it is easy toimagine them in the role of agitators as well.It is important to note that these dark hints apply to the Watchtowers, whatcollectively we know as “The Great Table”. The body of material describing its natureand use is what the angels sometimes called the Book of Enoch, though the use of thatterm varies in the source material. On one such occasion, Dee seeks the counsel of the"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"124archangel Michael concerning his business affairs back in England, himself being inCracow at the time. He is instructed to bring his concerns before the angel set over thatcountry, as found in the Book of Enoch [Ibid, p 394]. The archangel proceeds to warnDee against seeking anything of worldly or human affairs in the Sigillum Dei Æmeth,another more planetary portion of the system. Michael calls the Watchtowers “worldly”,and reminds Dee that they contain spirits both good and evil [Ibid].So, we gather that the Earth is a prison, with Keepers, Watch-men, and Princes, andit is into this place that man was turned, as a result of the Fall. The Watchtowersthemselves, elsewhere identified with the Earth, are shown to contain wicked Servants,and vile Slaves, as well as some good spirits, but all worldly, having no part of Heaven.Moreover, the four tablets signifying the Watchtowers are united by names that areextracted from those of the three Governors of the 10th Æthyr, and from this blackcrosse of union are drawn the names of wicked spirits and devils. And who was it that,according to the blessed angels, assailed Adam, and precipitated this Fall? Coronzon,of course [Ibid, p 92]. And incidentally, we appear to have learned that the Call of the30 Aires is itself the malediction pronounced by God when he cursed the Earth forAdam’s sake, as a consequence of the malice of that mighty Devil.It seems a thin tissue of an argument, to be sure, but I feel that taken in its entirety,it is rather stronger than one might expect. The Earth, the Four Watchtowers, areessentially bound up with the three Governors of the 10th Æthyr. Even Dee suspectedthat something was up with zax, and repeated his suspicions to Ave, as we have seenabove. In essence, we are presented with a riddle in the source material. To my mind,the angels and Crowley have supplied us with the answer to that riddle. It is C(h)oronzonthat inhabits the 10th Æthyr. With this key piece of data in hand, all of the intimationsof evil and wickedness associated with the black crosse, as well as the mixed natures ofthe Watchtowers, suddenly make sense.SATYREpilogue: While preparing this and other materials, I revisited Tyson’s book, and onceagain rejected his “Mr C is Lucifer” hypothesis. I am now more inclined to say he has apoint, but I don’t think it’s that simple. First, Crowley describes the Four Evil Princesof this World descending through the outermost abyss, only one of which was namedLucifer. What says he of the others? His silence on the matter does not speak well ofhis hypothesis. Traditionally these four may only be summoned after experiencingKnowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel, following the rationalebehind the Book of the Sacred Magic of Abramelin the Mage.

The highestof these is Kether, and its single vertical descending ray—which I believe is related tothe Daughter of Fortitude—is represented in the tarot as the Priestess of the SilverStar. By this power, the Adept commands the Princes, and it is efficacious because itspoint of origin lies beyond that of their “fall”.Applying this idea to the Four Watchers, or Four Mighty Kings of the Watchtowersof this World, it is easy to see that, if anything, Mr C may well be their Ruler, the spiritof Chaos that is the root cause of material existence. The Four may be much as Tysonsays, upholding and ordering this little bubble of reality in which we live. Pure Chaos isexceptionally rare, as that new science tells us. Most of what we normally encounter isbounded chaos. Viewed in this light, this seems to agree with what the angels told Dee,of “Keepers, Watch-men, and Princes”, placed over this world at the moment Adamfell. Budge speaks of a four headed deity of the Egyptians that appears to have beenadopted and used by the Gnostics, and this may well be significant. Jones taught me touse inverted invoking spirit pentagrams for the 2nd Key, four of them, one for eachname of five letters on the Spirit Table, saying they were evil, but so is the 2nd Key.Mr C doesn’t exist, in a way.

Ihave it somewhere, it being one of the few portions of his notebook that I copied fromthe microfilm. The hard copy I have includes the diagram of the Triangle, showing in acrude sketch the three dead pigeons at the three points, with Crowley’s position in thecenter. This, I was told, was that which it was sought to conceal, that he acted as an old-fashioned trance medium for the operation, channelling Choronzon directly. Whenyou read the Vision of the 10th, it is the only explanation that makes sense. The pages Ihave are hand-written, presumably by Neuburg. If it was instead a clear copytranscription, I wasn’t made aware of this. So, yes, the microfilm, and what few pages Iyet possess, are indeed from the original notebook, so far as I know. It was originally atthe University of Texas at Austin, but I assume thugs from the [deleted for legal reasons—Ed] have long since spirited it away.

It was even rumoured"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"127last year that the Stèle of Revealing in the Boulak Museum in Cairo is actually a fake,with the original being salted away in a secret safe deposit box of said occult organisation.Note that Liber AL 3:10 actually instructs Crowley to steal the Stèle of Revealing andset it upon his own altar:Get the Stèle of Revealing itself; set it in thy secret temple—and that temple is alreadyaright disposed—& it shall be your Kiblah for ever. It shall not fade, but miraculouscolour shall come back to it day after day. Close it in locked glass for a proof to the world.A copy of the Stèle is used in the Gnostic Mass. Kenneth Grant mentions on p 98 ofHecate’s Fountain (London: Skoob Books Publishing, 1992) how in the 1920s Crowleyhad a plan for J F C Fuller to spirit away the Stèle of Revealing from the BoulakMuseum, noting that “Fuller did not discover, until years after Crowley’s death, that hehad been earmarked to ‘abstruct’ the Stèle.”]Hi Satyr—It is the Weiser 1998 edition of Liber 418 that says on p 159 and p 170 thatthe pages on the 10th were torn out of the notebook. The manuscript of this Æthyrsurviving as I understand it is in fact the “revised and edited” version, the original pagestorn out the notebook having been lost. (I had assumed Crowley tore them out himself,but it could have been a certain occult organisation much later I suppose). Now, thisleads me to think that the version of events of the Call as we have them could well be a“creative reconstruction”, which goes back to my question concerning how Crowleyknew the 10th was accursèd. I am amused, incidentally, by your declaration that yournotes on this issue are a “thin tissue of an argument”, this is obviously what one sayswhen one has constructed a rather persuasive case. Certainly it is a much-neededexpansion on the rather brief and confusing note 2 about this that Crowley gives onp 159 on the Weiser 1998 Vision and the Voice, but also I do wonder whether Crowleyhad pieced it together so convincingly beforehand. In Algeria when he skryed the Æthyrshe had only his notebook with the Calls in it, he didn’t have the Great Table, blackcrosse of union, or the orphaned letters of Paraoan to muse upon the meaning of. Itmay simply be the case that he fully expected to encounter Choronzon and that inpreparing to meet this demon he essentially invoked him regardless of whetherChoronzon is native to the 10th Æthyr or not. He had the name of Choronzon inscribedin Hebrew in the Triangle of Art, so it is hardly surprising that he should haveencountered Choronzon in the 10th. That said, your argument makes much sense and itis always possible that Crowley had previously worked out this association, even thoughhe doesn’t appear to have written about it before the Algerian operations."},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"128But what, for instance, if it never happened like it is written at all, that the versionwe have is solely a retrospective “revision and editing”. Crowley doesn’t say what thenature of the revision was. Now, there is a doubt in my mind about whether the operationhappened exactly as published, due to the fact that these vital pages were apparentlytorn out and lost. This question seems important to me, it sort of gelled in my mindwhile thinking about the 10th and Choronzon.The Weiser 98 edition I must say is very good, in the late 1980s I used the versionfrom Gems from the Equinox, which omits most of the notes. The new Weiser editionhas previously unpublished material, such as the diagram of circle and triangle from the10th Æthyr, redrawn, plus the convenient inclusion of the relevant section fromConfessions.I confess I am uncertain what you mean about the “lie” of “abiding apart”. What areyou reading into this that I am missing exactly? When you say “because it was proofthat the story of Crowley ‘abiding apart’ during Neuburg’s ordeal was a lie”—do youmean that the wrestling match where Crowley-as-Choronzon broke the circle madeyou think there had been a lie? Or something else? I don’t get what you mean becausewasn’t the version including the wrestling match included in the original Equinox? Sowhy did you need “proof ” if it was already extant in print? You have me confused. Areyou saying that the extracts from the manuscript you have seen differ from the publishedversion?Now, are we going to say anything about Makhashanah? Is Liber 418 called 418because of Abrahadabra or because of Makhashanah? Does he say anything aboutMakhashanah anywhere else? A single reference in the 27th Æthyr of Liber 418 and onein the Ab-ul-Diz Working seems sparse for such an important word.Personally I feel Crowley wanted the 333 spelling of Choronzon rather than Dee’sbecause that meant the reference to “dispersion” in the 28th could be seen as a prophecyof the 10th, even though he claims not to have known the correlation at the time. Ormaybe he just preferred it to be 333, has a certain resonance.Got the mp3 recordings of Crowley reciting the first and second Keys, hypnotic.JOELHi Joel—I hate to admit this, but haven’t even seen the 1998 Weiser edition. The last“new” Caliphate oto tome I acquired was His Holiness Hymenæus Beta’s new-and-improved Magick (or Book 4, or whatever it’s supposed to be called). It claimed to be thedefinitive scholarly edition, had to be special ordered here locally, and set me backabout $50 US. I was so excited when it finally arrived, and decided to take the challenge"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"129and compare its text against that of previous editions of the included material in mypossession. After filling a sizable sheet with errata, I left-off the endeavor as entirelytoo infuriating an exercise.I think the perpetrators of this heinous volume should be hauled in chains to somesufficiently academic institution, there to be publicly stoned, to discourage others fromindulging in such editorial thuggery in the future. And thuggery it was, since I amunder the impression that one can no longer obtain those inexpensive Dover editionsof Magick In Theory and Practice because of their republication of this new andauthoritative volume.But now you’ve tempted me, and I may have to order this new edition of 418.Perhaps “lie” is too strong a word, and perhaps I have made much of something itselfno more than a mere ambiguity, that has been cleared-up in this latest edition of TheVision and the Voice. I don’t know. As I say, I haven’t seen it. David Jones brought to myattention that the text, as presented in The Equinox (Vol. I, No. V, “Special Supplement”),did not explicitly state that Crowley sat in the Triangle when the demon was evoked,though this is the only explanation that makes sense of the account. On p 93, it reads,when outlining the “precautions for the scribe”:Now, then, the Seer being entered within the triangle, let him take the Victims and cuttheir throats, pouring the blood within the Triangle, and being most heedful that notone drop fall without the Triangle; or else Choronzon should be able to manifest in theuniverse.And when the sand hath sucked up the blood of the victims, let him recite the Call ofthe Æthyr apart secretly as aforesaid. Then will the Vision be revealed, and the Voiceheard.Now, this is in agreement with what I was told, at least nominally, assuming that “secretly”implies that he hadn’t left the triangle after murdering the hapless pigeons (one mustwonder what the Seer did with the knife after he was through. I can’t imagine a saneoperator under the circumstances allowing the medium to retain any sharp objectswhatsoever). But then on the page following, a parenthetical remark is inserted whichstates: “Here the Spirit simulated the voice of Frater P., which also appeared to comefrom his station and not from the triangle.” This seems to conflict with the idea thatCrowley was himself corporeally in the Triangle at that time, don’t you think? As I say,if they’ve faithfully reproduced the diagram I’ve seen from the notebook, this ambiguityshould be cleared up straight away, since that drawing clearly showed the Seer’s stationto be in the Triangle of Art, and doubtless the editors of this latest edition have eitheramended the original text, or at least noted this inconsistency."},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"130If such is the case, then I can see now why I’ve led you to confusion on the matterwith my raving on about lies and chicanery. I don’t doubt that Neuburg and Mr C hadtheir little tussle in the sand. That much seems obvious from the text as given. However,it does seem that Mr C did not wish to leave the reader of the Equinox version of thestory with the impression that it had been the intention of our two heroes to haveCrowley channel Choronzon from the beginning.I was led to believe that this was a secret known to few students in the Order, back in1990, and that the establishment would just as soon keep it that way. Whether they didnot wish to promote this sort of practice in general, or they did not like the doubts itmight cast upon Crowley and his subsequent work, or some other reason entirely, Icannot say. I do feel confident that this was in Jones’s mind when he volunteered to sitin the Triangle himself during that evocation of Paimon.Crowley does mention Makhashanah in another place, as I discovered yesterdaywhile looking into the Choronzon question. In The Confessions of Aleister Crowley, whilediscussing possible proof that might be had that a given vision is genuine, he says:Let me give one example. The Angel of the twenty-seventh Æthyr said: “The word ofthe Aeon is makhashanah.” I immediately discredited him; because I knew that theword of the Aeon was, on the contrary, abrahadabra. Inquiry by the Holy Cabala thenshowed me that the two words had the same numerical value, 418. The apparent blunderwas thus an absolute proof that the Angel was right. Had he told me that the word wasabrahadabra, I should have thought nothing of it, arguing that my imagination mighthave put the words in his mouth. [p 617]It’s not, I fear, quite the kind of mention you had in mind, but there it is. Seems to passoff the whole thing as inconsequential at best.I agree that Crowley has altered the spelling of Choronzon so it might be summedto 333. But why 333? It’s a nice enough number, to be sure, but I’m afraid I don’t quitefollow how the reference in the 28th (which I think does foreshadow Choronzon in the10th) makes the number 333 somehow more desirable. I looked at Sepher Sephiroth, andfound the following entered under “333”:Qabalah of the Nine Chambers aiq bkrChoronzon [vide Dr Dee, & Lib. 418, 10th Aire] chvrvnzvn (f)Snow shlgSurprised to find no mention of “dispersion”, at all. Sepher Sephiroth was originallybegun by Allan Bennett, and subsequently enlarged by Crowley and others before being"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"131published in The Equinox. It is possible, therefore, that this particular spelling originatedwith someone other than Crowley himself, at a date much earlier than 1909 (in hisintroductory remarks, he says that he inherited the material in 1899).The mp3 recordings of Crowley’s Enochian are hypnotic, aren’t they? They are muchbetter than I remember them. I tend to “vibrate” the god names embedded in the Keysa bit like he does, it seems.SATYRHi Satyr—Re: “Here the Spirit simulated the voice of Frater P., which also appeared tocome from his station and not from the triangle.” This sentence still appears in theWeiser 98 edition, but it goes uncommented upon. I agree, if the diagram wasn’t presentthen it wouldn’t be too clear that Choronzon was the possessed Crowley in the Triangle.The intro has the Seer retiring to a “secret place”, indicating that perhaps they simplydidn’t originally want to let on that he was in the Triangle. The text doesn’t make thisclear at all, but the diagram does. Strikes me that Crowley was attempting to preserveambiguity on the fact that Choronzon was himself possessed, thus putting at armslength how exactly Choronzon manifested without actually lying about it (it’s a “secretplace” because without the diagram you don’t realise he is actually in the Triangle).Surprisingly this is not commented on in the Weiser 98 edition, despite the fact thatthe diagram is there making it clear. I guess they are just leaving it to the readers towork out for themselves. Interesting you say that this was regarded as a kind of otoinsider’s secret back in 1990. I can’t even remember what I thought was going on in thatÆthyr back when I read it in Gems from the Equinox in the late 80s, but the Weiser 98edition is a great improvement and it has certainly become lately one of my most thumbedthrough books.Actually, thumbing through it once again, reading the 10th most carefully for theumpteenth time, I notice a note of Crowley’s concerning his retiring to a secret placeand secretly invoking the Æthyr sitting within his black robe, p 160 n3:The greatest precautions were taken at the time, and have since been yet further fortified,to Keep Silence concerning the Rite of Evocation. The Major Adept is warned mostseriously against attempting to emulate this operation, which is (in any case) improperfor him to perform. To call forth Choronzon, unless one be wholly above the Abyss, is toensure the most appalling and immediate catastrophe.So this appears to explain why Crowley didn’t spell out that he was sitting in the Triangleof Art, he presents himself as wishing to conceal the precise manner in which Choronzon"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"132was called ostensibly to protect others from repeating his practice. He is “KeepingSilence”. This would also explain why the 10th was edited and revised the day after, toedit out references that made it clear that Choronzon was Crowley possessed by thedemon, except for the previously unpublished diagram. It makes sense now. Ah well,we have got somewhere. It seems strangely obvious all of a sudden. I suppose my notremembering the confusion inherent in previous published versions of Liber 418, andnot realising there was anything here that constituted something of an informal oto“secret”, and you not realising the diagram with the Seer in the Triangle had now beenpublished, enabled us in the end to see what was clear all along but had been purposefullyocculted.This is corroborated by a sentence on p 165:This last was spoken from the triangle in the natural voice of the Frater, which Choronzonagain simulated. But he did not succeed in taking the Frater’s form—which was absurd!Here Crowley is having a bit of a joke, and he appends a note to the above statement:“In this Æthyr are certain silences maintained.” Clearly he is using the term “Silence”in its technical occult usage, ie lying through one’s teeth. In The Confessions of AleisterCrowley I see now that he states: “During all this time I had astrally identified myselfwith Choronzon, so that I experienced each anguish, each rage, each despair, each insaneoutburst.” Given such clues, it is odd that it took until 1998 before the charade waspublicly ended.Interesting point you make about what Crowley did with the dagger after slaughteringthe pigeons. He couldn’t exactly throw it outside the Triangle could he, because thatwould be allowing some of the sacrificial blood to fall outside of the Triangle, thusallowing Choronzon to manifest in the Universe. As for its present whereabouts, KennethGrant claims to have it. There’s material on the later history of this magical dagger inGrant’s Hecate’s Fountain (p 5 and pp 11–12). Apparently it “accidentally” featured in anumber of Grant’s New Isis Lodge rituals (which may or may not have taken placesolely in Mr Grant’s mind). There’s a photograph of it in his Outside the Circles of Time.As for Makhashanah, I can’t blame Crowley for relegating his “Word of the Aeon”to the status of inconsequentiality, after all I have done precisely the same with Jubalcain.It appears Crowley regarded Makhashanah as merely a coded form of Abrahadabrarather than a word in its own right, not considering that it was Abrahadabra that shouldhave been sidelined. I guess he found that difficult because Abrahadabra is enshrined inLiber AL, but even so how could he keep a straight face proclaiming Abrahadabra asany kind of magick word."},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"133As for why 333, merely being half of 666 makes it attractive enough I would havethought. But interesting its equivalence with “dispersion” goes unremarked upon inSepher Sephiroth. I think you may have a point about the Choronzon spelling potentiallybeing bequeathed to Crowley by Allan Bennett on the latter’s departure to Ceylon in1899, I hadn’t considered that. Of course we don’t know whether “Choronzon” wasincluded in Bennett’s original material or was a later addition.Interesting that in the “Note by Scribe” (p 171, Weiser 98) Neuburg says: “Theaccount of the further dealings of Choronzon with the Scribe will be found in theRecord of Omnia Vincam.” A note says this is not believed to be extant. One wonderswhether Victor Neuburg Jnr might have it, if he’s still alive. Did I tell you I met him inthe 80s?JOEL“it shall become full of beetles...”Hi Satyr—Re-reading The Vision and the Voice I couldn’t help but think that it is to anextent tainted by the “revelations” of Liber AL. Not entirely fresh but force-fitted intohis established worldview. The Book of the Law, when examined, is hardly anythingmore than a cut-up of phrases and personages from the catalogue entry for Exhibit 666at the Boulak Museum, Cairo, 1904, combined with a will to world occult dominationwith a pseudo-Apocalyptic flavour coupled with a recent reading of Rabelais still freshin the mind, but even then it is hardly a “breakthrough in gray room”.Liber AL has little binding or profound vision holding it together, all it is is a first tryby someone who really pulled it off five years later, but by that time the die was cast.Hard to avoid the leakage of one’s own stuff into genuinely channelled material, that Icertainly realise, every ardent ufo believer channels aliens to voice the message. Thoughthe visions of Liber 418 are to me very genuine despite this, the authenticity of a visionI feel is nonetheless marked by how much of one’s own stuff one manages to keep out.Which is probably reflective of depth of trance. Now Crowley of course thought hisLiber AL and Ra-Hoor-Khuit and Stèle of Revealing and all that was a universal truth,so to have it swilling around in the background of his Algerian visions probably didn’tseem like an imposition, rather a confirmation of the authenticity of the newly skryedmaterial. But to me, who doesn’t see it that way, who sees Liber AL as a transitoryinspiration blown out of all proportion to its actual worth and built up into something"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"134that cannot now be admitted to be second rate without an immense loss of face bythose who have accorded it canonical authority, it is evidence of Crowley contaminatinghis Algerian visions with his own stuff.And it’s strange that Liber AL is universally accepted by Thelemites as some mega-scripture whereas the vastly superior Liber 418 is almost regarded as supplementarymaterial, a mere book, rather than his actual magnum opus of magical attainment (a gayThelemite friend sees this as a heterosexual/homosexual issue: Rose Kelly acceptable,Victor Neuburg unacceptable, in the eyes of the conservative straight-laced oto Scatter-Monkeys left to run the show when their Alpha Male fell out the tree and bit the dust).What’s worse is that Thelemites who themselves don’t understand Liber AL—save as aschizophrenic can read meaning into words and numbers on a bus ticket—have atendency to superciliously regard anyone who dares to criticise it as simply uninitiated,tapping their noses knowingly as if they themselves have penetrated its concealedmysteries, yet how many of them have published their own treatise on the nature of theUniverse or other mystical subject, a basic requirement as I understand it in the A∴A∴as proof of worth and magical advancement.I have decided my favourite line from The Book of the Law: “it shall become full ofbeetles...” (III, 25). A much-ignored line I feel.JOELJoel—On the “beetles” thing, Crowley comments:These beetles, which appeared with amazing suddenness in countless numbers atBoleskine during the summer of 1904 ev, were distinguished by a long single horn, thespecies was new to the naturalists in London to whom specimens were sent forclassification. [Israel Regardie, ed. The Law Is For All. Phoenix, Arizona: Falcon, 1986,p 285]And in the Autohagiography:As to this perfume of The Book of the Law, “let it be laid before me, and kept thick withperfumes of your orison: it shall become full of beetles as it were and creeping thingssacred unto me.” One day, to my amazement, having gone into the bathroom to bathe, Idiscovered a beetle. As I have said, I take no interest in natural history and know nothingof it.But this beetle attracted my attention at once. I had never seen anything like it before.It was about an inch and a half long and had a single horn nearly as long as itself. The"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"135horn ended in a small sphere suggestive of an eye. From that moment, for about a fortnight,there was an absolute plague of these beetles.

I sent a specimen to London but the experts were unable to identifythe species.Here was a tangible piece of Magick. It ought to have convinced me that The Book ofthe Law meant business. Instead, it left me absolutely cold. I experienced a certain proudglee, much as I had in the King’s Chamber of the Great Pyramid, but there it stopped. Itook the necessary measures to protect Rose against the murderous attack of Mathers,and went on playing billiards. [Confessions, pp 408–409]Whenever I find myself about to take Crowley’s statements, any statement, literallyand at face value, I remind myself of past experience, and immediately check myself. Inthis case, I take it this way: “perfumes of your orison” is obviously semen in some form,and under those circumstances (astral) things would be creeping all over the damnedplace.Not sure if I’m playing devil’s advocate in all this, or how you’ll react to any particularstatement I might make that appears to defend Crowley’s cause. I agree with the conceptof “Class A” material, and would take far more exception to his shenanigans if he didnot include portions of The Vision and the Voice as also being “Class A”, some of theother Holy Books (like ARARITA), Revelation, probably Ezekiel, at least part of it, andother similar documents. Consider the oldest layer of the Yi. May it be changed, be itno more than the shape of a letter? What of that book by Lao Dan? To my mind,whether Liber AL is also “Class A” is neither here nor there. Perhaps it was a receivedtext, perhaps not. He says it was, but he also says The Vision and the Voice was as well.The latter seems indeed to be the case, and since parts of Liber AL appear to be atobvious variance with Crowley at the time of its reception, it is possible it was too. OrI am at least forced to admit the possibility. That I think is the real message of The Bookof the Law: If you try hard enough, you can really talk to God (or Heaven, or whateverwe mean by some cognate term).If his work, by hook or by crook, forces a body to think it might be possible to forgeone’s own individual and unique link with Heaven (the Divine, the hga), then it isjustified. Right now, the folks that have seized control over his estate have turned thatwork into a money-making machine and petty power brokerage firm. The moneychangers have once again occupied the courts of the temple, as indeed they have before.It happens.

II, v 57 is a direct quote of Revelation 22:11. Thedirections for the “cakes of light” (Liber AL III, v 23), may be compared to Leviticus 2,Chronicles 31, and most especially Ezekiel 16. It seems to me there were others, but theynow escape me. How many Thelemites know this much Judæo-Christianity has creptinto their “new” religion, their big break with the establishment?Hi Satyr—Well, interested that there was a story behind the beetles after all. Manyyears ago I walked up “Little Bread Loaf Hill”, El Panecillo, in Quito, Ecuador. Quitea steep trudge in the thin high Andean air. At the top is an immense metal statue of LaVirgen de Quito—an angel-winged Virgin—dominating the old city, but what hasstuck in my mind far more is that the ground surrounding the statue was covered in athick layer of hundreds if not thousands of dead large iridescent-blue beetles over quitea large area. It was an amazing sight, such that one could not approach the statuewithout walking over the beetles, which I didn’t do as some may still have been alive.Dung beetles I believe they were. It would be interesting to know whether this wasunusual or a common occurrence there, it was certainly unusual to me and I thoughtabout it for days afterwards.Indeed, just a few days afterwards I was involved in a train crash high in the Andesmountains on the “autoferro”, which is a dieselbus on a railway line. The autoferro hitthe previous autoferro that had broken an axle and come off the tracks but presumablyhadn’t been reported yet, and the collision left us hanging over the side of a mountain.Most curious was that on the way up into the mountains there were many crosses ofpeople who had died at the edge of the narrow line twisting around and around themountains into the developing mist and drizzle. We eventually came to a railside shrineto the Virgin Mary at which we stopped and a collection was taken for the poor, and asa blessing and protection for us, which was deposited in the glass case of the shrine.After the crash we stumbled out of the autoferro and I was greeted by another sight Iwill never forget, night was falling and the air was alive with fireflies, which I had neverseen before, and as the eye gradually followed them up they gave way to my first realview of the southern hemisphere’s stars, so many more than I was used to seeing in thenorthern hemisphere.When I was stood looking at the twisted rails talking to a Frenchman about thecrash, I said: “So much for the collection at the Virgin’s shrine.” And he said: “I wasthinking just the opposite.” And of course I realised he was quite right, and I just satdown and lay back and looked at the stars, not at all perturbed by our predicament, in astate, I think, of Grace."},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"137But I didn’t choose the Liber AL sentence about the beetles thinking of that, I haveonly just been reminded of that on reading the comment of Crowley’s concerning thebeetles, which I suppose is interesting in itself.

Curious to see whether they still have the specimen and his covering letter.JOEL[Ed’s note— La Virgen de Quito is actually the woman from Revelation 12, she has acrown of 12 stars and stands on the dragon which she binds in chains.]Tyson’s theory Crowley used the 19th Key inEnglish not EnochianHi Satyr—Donald Tyson in Enochian Magic for Beginners (pp 55–56) says it is not clearto him whether Crowley used the Enochian or the English version of the 19th Key forsounding the Æthyrs. Tyson mentions that Crowley speaks in his Confessions of “changingtwo names” in the Key for each Æthyr, so Tyson thinks this means he could have usedEnglish rather than Enochian. He writes:In the English version, two words must be changed for each Æthyr, but in the Enochianversion, only one word. So perhaps Crowley invoked the Æthyrs using the English versionof the nineteenth Key.What’s your opinion of this?JOELHi Joel—The most puzzling aspect of Tyson’s statement is, “In the English version,two words must be changed for each Æthyr, but in the Enochian version, only oneword”. What the hell does he mean, “two words”? I’ve puzzled over this for a whilenow, and still have no answer. For that matter, what did Crowley mean when he saidmuch the same thing? I found the relevant passage in The Hag, by the way:"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"138There are nineteen of these Keys: the first two conjuring the element called Spirit; thenext sixteen invoke the Four Elements, each subdivided into four; the nineteenth, bychanging two names, may be used to invoke any one of what are called the thirty “Æthyrs”or “Aires”.What these are is difficult to say. In one place we are told that they are “Dominionextending in ever widening circles without and beyond the Watch Towers of the Universe”,these Watch Towers composing a cube of infinite magnitude. Elsewhere, we find thatthe names of the angels which govern them are contained in the Watch Towers themselves;but (most disconcerting disenchantment!) they are identified with various countries ofthe earth, Styria [sic], Illyria, etc, as if “aire” simply meant clime. I have always maintainedthe first definition. I suspected Kelly of finding Dee unsupportable at times, with hispity, pedantry, credulity, respectability and lack of humour. I could understand that hebroke out and made fun of the old man by spouting nonsense. [Confessions, p 612]I have compared this statement with the G∴D∴ “Book of the Concourse of the Forces”,and can find no precedent, nor is there any indication of changing two words in Crowley’snotebook, “The Forty-Eight Calls or Keys”, which I am led to believe he had with himin Algeria as mentioned in The Hag [Ibid, p 611]. It appears upon inspection to be astraightforward transcription of the G∴D∴ instruction as he would have received it,with some relatively minor glosses, emendations, and additions.From a textual standpoint, at least as I read it, Tyson hasn’t a leg to stand on. Crowleyuses the word “Enochian” to denote the language, not as a general term for the systemas a whole, as is common today. The word appears twice in The Hag prior to hisdescription of the general method used to invoke the Æthyrs:These Keys or Calls being rewritten backwards, there appeared conjurations in a languagewhich they called “Enochian” or Angelic. It is not a jargon; it has a grammar and syntaxof its own. It is very much more sonorous, stately and impressive than even Greek orSanskrit, and the English translation, though in places difficult to understand, containspassages of a sustained sublimity that Shakespeare, Milton and the Bible do not surpass.To condemn Kelly as a cheating charlatan—the accepted view—is simply stupid. If heinvented Enochian and composed the superb prose, he was at worst a Chatterton withfifty times that poet’s ingenuity and five hundred times his poetical genius. [Ibid, p 612]Comparing this with the methodology he later describes, “... I would take this stoneand recite the Enochian Key...” [Ibid, p 616], it seems obvious to me that by “EnochianKey” he intends “Enochian version of the Key”, as opposed to the English.Y’know, sometimes I impress even myself.

It seems that this document is an almost exacttranscription from his notebook, which I suppose isn’t that surprising, really. The mostobvious differences being that the Enochian versions of the Keys are not presentedinterlineally in the Angelic character as they are in the notebook, and in his transcriptionsin Latin character, the zeds are not expanded into “zod”, as was taught in the G∴D∴system.On the first page of “The Call or Key of the Thirty Æthyrs” two footnotes appear(“A Brief Abstract of the Symbolic Representation of the Universe Derived by DoctorJohn Dee Through the Skrying of Sir Edward Kelly: Part II: The Forty-Eight Calls”.The Equinox, Vol. I, No. VIII. New York: Weiser, 1972. p 125, n1 and n2). The first, onthe word lil, reads: “Or other Aire as may be willed.” The other glosses the wordidoigo, stating: “This name may be appropriately varied with the Aire.” I think thatrather solves our mystery, and in so doing speaks to any questions concerning the qualityof our Mr Tyson’s scholarship as well. It seems now that his entire argument falls flat, asby his own reasoning, the Enochian version of the Key is most assuredly what Crowleyintended.Incidentally, The Goetia was published by Crowley in 1904, complete with theconjurations and such translated into Enochian. Again, it is just silly, or divisive, toassert that he would not have used that language when reciting the Call of the ThirtyAires. Well, I’ve had my fun for the morning, and it’s back to work.SATYRHi Satyr—As soon as you mentioned Idoigo I recalled reading this years ago, whichsurprises me since I never thought I took much interest in Enochian back then andcan’t think where I would have read it.On “two words must be changed”, Tyson may be relying on Geoffrey James’s book,which does indeed give the impression that two words need to be changed in the Englishversion of the Key, both the name of the Aire and its ordinal number. Although inTyson’s own version of the 19th Key he doesn’t makes James’s error and only one wordhas to be changed in the English version, such that it is hard to see what he is talkingabout. Seems to me he may have formed his impression concerning the change of twowords by studying James initially, even though an ordinal number is hardly a “name”,and has simply never revisited his thoughts on the matter. Stupid as it sounds, I can’tthink how else his statement could be accounted for."},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"140If you were to change Idoigo, incidentally, what is the full range of alternatives? Thisgoes back to those Enochian words I earlier mentioned to you as looking and soundinglike names. But does Crowley give any indication of alternatives to Idoigo?JOELHi Joel—I understand what you’re saying about his changing “two words”. Call me oldfashioned, but Tyson’s interpretation would require altering the received text. In thatscan I sent you, Dee wrote as clearly as his crabby scrawl would allow “O you heuenswhich dwell in the first Ayre, are Mightie in the partes of the Erth...” and this agrees sofar as I know with what the angels told him. I see no lil to be changed when openingan Æthyr other than the 1st, not in the English version. If what you’re saying is indeedthe case, his argument is even more ludicrous than I’d thought.You recall the two words changed in the Enochian version of the 19th because thetwo footnotes are faithfully reproduced in Gems From the Equinox: Instructions by AleisterCrowley for His Own Magickal Order (Israel Regardie [ed]. Phoenix, Arizona: Falcon,1986. p 428). I remember you saying that was your first working text of the material,just as it was for me. I should have remembered myself, considering how many timesI’ve read that page, and it was so obvious after I’d found it. Idoigo is the name on thevertical portion of the “cherubic cross” in the upper left corner of the upper left quadrantof “The Great Table” (see Turner, pp 59, 60, and 66–68). I don’t quite follow Crowley’sreasoning, though.

His correspondence I thenrelayed to “John Day” (a pseudonym), a member of the Caliphate oto in the UnitedStates, for criticism. The subsequent debate continued back and forth for several rounds,and is published below. The debate centres on the idea that the 18° contains Christiansymbolism that Crowley failed to wholly expunge in his reworking of the rite, and assuch its narrative integrity is seriously flawed, meaning that the potential effect of theoto ritual is questionable. It should be noted that Christian symbolism in the 18° doesnot necessarily mean that it is ipso facto “Christian”. In fact, Francis King in RitualMagic in England (1970) expressed the opinion that the rite was anti-Christian, hequoted an anonymous “anti-Masonic writer” he said he himself was inclined to agreewith who called the rite “a little sinister” and stated that the 18° or Rose-Croix degree“carried the unfortunate suggestion that the death of Satan was being mourned”. It’sbeen many years since I read Walton Hannah, but that sounds like a quote from him. HT F Rhodes in his excellent book The Satanic Mass (1954), relying on the 1926 privateprinting of the 18° ritual, extracts of which had been reproduced by Walton Hannah inDarkness Visible (1951), explicitly linked the rite to the Black Mass in his chapter entitled“The Devil and the Freemasons”."},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"142Rhodes, after describing the 18° ritual, calls the theology represented in the ceremony“fundamentally un-Christian and even anti-Christian”. But he goes further:It is a little disconcerting to find that the preposterous Bataille was right, if for all thewrong and most discreditable reasons, when he approximated the Freemason’s god toLucifer.Dr Bataille, in Rhode’s view in an earlier chapter, had sensationally represented thefreemasonic Knights of the Rose Croix of Heredom trampling over the crucifix ontheir way to the Satanic Holy of Holies. Rhodes ends his chapter on the 18° in nouncertain terms:On this evidence, Freemasonry has the curious distinction of having kept alive, until thepresent day, the traditions of the ‘Mass of Vain Observance’. It is hoped that this can besaid without offence to some 4,000,000 of our fellow-countrymen who, in spite of this,do not seem to be committed to a greater extent than the rest of us to a ‘Satanic’ way oflife.One of the most interesting aspects of the ritual from my own perspective, and one notmentioned by Rhodes though arguably it might support his case even more, is wherethe candidate, standing in the darkness of the corridor from the Black Room andChamber of Death, knocks to be admitted to the Red Room, which is brilliantly litwith red furnishings. Thirty-three red candles in candlesticks, arranged in the shape ofthree inverted triangles on an eight-step white altar, burn like a hearth surrounding thewhite Cubic Stone on the fourth step, and 18 red roses are displayed between them.(The “Cubic Stone” is said to represent the Christian cross, because a cube when openedout into two-dimensional space becomes a cross. In the 18° rite the Cubic Stone “pouredforth blood and water”. This same inspiration is behind the name of “The Order of theCubic Stone”, an occult order practising Enochian magick that was founded inWolverhampton, England, in the 1960s by Robert Turner and others.)In the basement of the Supreme Council for the 33° at 10 Duke Street, St James’s,London—where the most impressive manifestation of “the Black Room, the Chamberof Death, and the Red Room” may be found—the door knocker of the Red Room is ahorned and cloven-hoofed demon with one leg crossed over the other, based on the“Lincoln Imp” in Lincoln Cathedral. The password to enter the Red Room is “Abaddon”.Abaddon is mentioned once in the King James version of the Bible, in Revelation 9:11.The following is Rev. 9:7–11:"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"143And the shapes of the locusts were like unto horses prepared unto battle; and on theirheads were as it were crowns like gold, and their faces were as the faces of men. And theyhad hair as the hair of women, and their teeth were as the teeth of lions. And they hadbreastplates, as it were breastplates of iron; and the sound of their wings was as the soundof chariots of many horses running to battle. And they had tails like unto scorpions, andthere were stings in their tails: and their power was to hurt men five months. And theyhad a king over them, which is the angel of the bottomless pit, whose name in theHebrew tongue is Abaddon, but in the Greek tongue hath his name Apollyon.Although Abaddon is named only once in the King James version, the actual Hebrewword (}wdb)) occurs five times in the Old Testament, where it is translated not as thename of a destroying angel but simply as “destruction”—in Job 28:22; 31:12; 26:6; Proverbs15:11; 27:20. In the last three of these passages the Revised Version retains the word“Abaddon” as a name. Presumably Abaddon is therefore also intended to be the nameof the demon on the doorknocker to the Red Room. I asked Jac Partit to briefly describethe rite:The ritual of the 18th degree of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite takes place inthe three rooms you describe. As a knight of the East and the West the candidate isescorted into the Black Room which is placed in time after the death and burial ofChrist and the focus is on death. The Chamber of Death is where the candidate isplaced to reflect on death and the emblems of mortality. The Red Room is then reachedby passing through a door on which a knocker is placed in the shape of an elementaldemon. This is the guardian who must be overcome to ascend to the next level—“Demonest deus inversus”, “the Devil is God inversed”—we move from duality to the perfectionof unity. The Red Room is where the 18°—the Knighthood of the Pelican and Eagle andperfection of the red cross—are conferred. The sequence of the colours black, white, redare the threefold alchemical path from nigredo (putrefaction), to albino (resurrection) torebredo (perfection). As an aside that is why a Cardinal wears red—he has achieved“spiritual perfection”.As I considered further the claims made by Rhodes and Hannah that the 18° was“Satanic” in character, I asked Jac Partit to comment from his perspective as an insiderto the rite:The view that the 18th degree is somehow Satanic presumably is based on Hannah’sremarks. If King and Rhodes cover other areas than those I consider then can you highlightthem. Hannah raises three pieces of evidence:"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"1441. The use of the word Abaddon.2. That the ceremony of the Black Room describes the crucifixion to be a “dire calamity”because of the defeat of Satan.3. The agape of the third point. An important factor here is to distinguish between anorthodox and heterodox viewpoint. As a Catholic priest, Hannah would have been asupporter of the one, holy, and undivided orthodox Catholic church led by the Pope asthe source of doctrinal authority. He condemns freemasonry as heterodox, that is heretical,because it deviates from accepted doctrine (this has been stated in four papal Bulls—most recently that of Leo XII in 1884), most particularly because it promotes syncretism.This is because freemasonry in general holds that all faiths can participate in its ritualsand that all are equal paths to the gaotu [“Great Architect of the Universe”—Ed]. Thatit is a latter-day mystery cult.Hannah’s three points can be addressed as follows:1. Abaddon is from Revelation 9:11. He is the Angel of the bottomless pit. Its relevanceis to the doctrinal significance of the three days that Christ was dead following thecrucifixion and before the resurrection. This period has been described as the harrowingof Hell and was the subject of much art during the medieval age—it alludes to the viewthat those in Hell would be redeemed by Christ. Esoterically it concerns the doctrinethat to pass into a higher world the initiate must overcome his shadow form—the dwelleron the threshold—which symbolises our material base nature and attitudes. By knowinghis name the candidate has brought his own “demon” under control. He is not worshippedor used as a source of power.2. The Black Room is part of a mystery play. It represents the moment of the crucifixionand the loss at that point is mourned. As is the case in church services on Good Fridaythe vestments are black and the attitude is one of loss. The ritual of the Red Roommakes clear that it is in the mystical Christ that the candidate is perfected. Hannah hasno mystical insight into the symbolism. Again I would say that the ritual is probablyheretical but not Satanic.3. The third point uses neither a consecrated host nor a parody of the Mass. It is a ritualmeal founded on the principles of fraternity. I would also argue that the known authorsof the ritual were Christian mystics and thaumaturgists.jac partit"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"145There is no mention of the demonic doorknocker in the official rite privately printedfor the Supreme Council (I have the 1994 revision, which runs to 73 A6 pages, 1995 isthe latest), but it has long retained my fascination since first hearing about it, over andabove the perhaps more weighty matters now to be discussed. Namely, that AleisterCrowley substantially plagiarised the 18° ritual when constructing his 5° ritual for theOrdo Templi Orientis. For reasons of space (and copyright) I am unable to reproducethe two rituals, but interested parties should have little difficulty following the argumentor tracking down the appropriate source materials. I am in any case primarily motivatedto publish a debate on this matter by two informed insiders, rather than pursue thecheaper practice of publishing the rituals of secret societies as if such two-bit detectivework was somehow impressive. Here follows Jac Partit’s considered opinion on thecentral problem with the oto 5°.JOEL BIROCOJac Partit’s initial salvoBack to the oto fifth degree. I won’t go through a word for word comparison becauseyou will be able to do this with the 1994 ritual [of the 18°]. To me the 5° seems sototally flawed as to raise the possibility that it has a completely destructive effect. Thisis because the fundamental structure is unchanged—rather than redesign the buildingthe oto have rearranged the mantelpiece.The ritual had its foundation in one Willermoz, a Christian Thaumaturgist andMartinist of Lyon. Therefore the 18° temple was set out to correspond to the Christianpassion. The oto have not fundamentally changed this. For example the pelican isChrist crucified and the eagle Christ in his ascension. These are unchanged. The numbers33 etc and colours are Christian and one has to ask whether the trampling of the crossand presence of the priestess are any more than window dressing. Indeed the failure torealign the symbolic structure means that conflicting currents are worked. You will seethat the sections of the New Testament have been removed yet no alternative is put intheir place—the reference to the rending of the temple is again a Christian one.The lost word in the first point in the 18° is inri, which is a formula alluding to thelost word and far more numinous than the approach introduced by the oto. Theobligation is pure masonry.The rest of the second point is more a series of exchanges with a catechism.

The subsequent tattoo that is recommended isunnecessary—for those that can observe will see.The oto third point is a travesty and has no sense of the secular communion of the18th degree.3/10 if that.JAC PARTITThe crimson flameThere is another aspect of the original 18° ritual that has always fascinated me—theuse of a strontium salt dissolved in spirit in the chalice, which when ignited produces acrimson flame, strontium being the only element to produce such a vivid crimson flame,much as copper produces a green flame and sodium an orange flame. This was mentionedby H T F Rhodes, information he appeared to have obtained from Walton Hannah’sDarkness Visible, a 1951 exposé of freemasonry (which was countered in 1952 by adelightfully vitriolic little book called Light Invisible written by a freemason spittingblood under the pseudonym of “Vindex”, who said Mr Hannah should be “horse-whipped”). I asked Jac Partit about the use of strontium:I have just checked Walton Hannah and it is he who talks about the use of strontium inthe fire ignited in the third point—when the word is returned to the celestial realm. Weno longer use strontium in the UK. Hannah’s comments on the degree display anastonishing ignorance of mystical Christianity which I suppose I should have expected.More than happy to comment further when you have received some response [fromJohn Day]—I suspect that many oto initiates are simply unaware of how poor aninterpretation it is and how much is unchanged from the 18th degree.JBJohn Day’s response to PartitIn my self-appointed role as advocate for the opposition, I thought it best to begin withfirst principles, and thus my initial considerations have centred on the following statementmade by Jac Partit:"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"147The ritual had its foundation in one Willermoz, a Christian Thaumaturgist and Martinistof Lyon. Therefore the 18° temple was set out to correspond to the Christian passion.I’ve been looking into this Willermoz fellow, and he led an interesting life in trulyfascinating times. But what little information I have does not necessarily imply that hewas the originator of the Rose-Croix of Heredom.According to Waite’s A New Encyclopædia of Freemasonry, under the heading“Emperors of the East and West”:The full title of this, the first masonic system which superposed a colossal series of Gradesupon the Craft Rite, was council of the Emperors of the East and West, SovereignPrince Masons, Substitutes General of the Royal Art, Grand Surveillants and Officers ofthe Grand Sovereign Lodge of St. John of Jerusalem. It was otherwise and in moreconcise terms the rite of heredom or of perfection. It was founded at Paris in orabout 1758 and consisted in all of twenty-five Degrees. We know nothing concerningthe circumstances of its origin or the persons connected therewith. The suggestion thatit was a daughter of the chapter of clermont or a transfiguration and extension ofthat body has been made in plausible terms, but nothing approaching evidence comesforward to support it. [...] Every question is open, moreover, as to the Grade content ofthe clermont chapter. While it is difficult under such circumstances to hold anyview—however tentatively—one inference from what I must call tradition on the subjectmakes it appear that the Chapter was Templar in its High Grade developments whilethe Council at its inception was not. The Council also was the first Continental Ritewhich included the Grade of rose-croix in its system. [...]Story of the Rite.—Wheresoever it came from, the presence of the Rose-Croix inthis sequence is the key to its importance as a system, while next in consequence theretois the grade of kadosh. So far as it is possible to say, we hear of neither independentlyprior to 1758, except in spurious legend or traditional history. If the Council came forthready made at that date, in all its Ritual panoply, we can understand the success whichseems to have attended it for a period. It appears—within a surprisingly short space—tohave established daughter Councils at Bordeaux, Lyons, Toulouse, Marseilles, and Arras.[Vol. I, pp 254–255]According to a biography of M Jean-Baptiste Willermoz (1730–1824) I located on theweb (Lard help us!) at http://www.icbl.hw.ac.uk/~bill/_mim0002.html, he founded theLodge of “The Perfect Friendship” in 1753, which was chartered by the Grande LogeNationale de France on 21 November 1756. Willermoz later founded the “SovereignChapter of Knights of the Black Eagle/Rose-Croix”, in 1763, presumably during histenure as Provincial Grand Master."},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"148However, he was not necessarily a “Martinist”, at that time, given the data I havebefore me. For though Willermoz was initiated into the Rite des Élus Cohens byMartines de Pasqually himself, at Versailles, it occurred sometime after he left Lyonsfor Paris in May of 1767 [according to the above essay].This Rite is supposed to have been founded by Martines in 1754 [Heckethorn, TheSecret Societies of All Ages and Countries: Vol. I, §266], but Waite finds this claim doubtful[Vol. II, p 60]. He notes:It appears to have had a sovereign tribunal at Paris in the year 1767, at the head of whichwas that mysterious, magnetic personality, Don Martines de Pasqually. He himself isfirst heard of at Toulouse in 1760, furnished with a hieroglyphical charter and the title ofInspector-General. [Ibid, Vol. II, p 336]Heckethorn states that the “Order of Martinists” was founded in this same year of1754 [Vol. I, §266]. I can find no date at which Willermoz was initiated into the“Martinists”, and therefore have no reason to admit a date prior to 1760, two years afterthe foundation of the first Rose-Croix.Is Partit seriously suggesting that Willermoz originated the Rose-Croix degree inLyons, prior to 1758, and that it was subsequently adopted by the Council of theEmperors of the East and West? If so, it seems that he is privy to information notavailable to Waite at the time of his writing, and I would very much like to hear more ofhis sources.Otherwise, we can hardly appeal to Willermoz as the ultimate authority on itssymbolism, as his usage would be derivative of a pre-existing ritual, whatever hissubsequent impact on modern (Supreme Grand Council of England) interpretationsof the Grade. To my mind, any argument about the “correct” form of the rituals of theRose-Croix must include some defensible statement(s) concerning its origin.Waite, though qualifying his words, waxes most eloquent in condemning falsepretenders to the Grade, reflecting closely Jac Partit’s interpretation, saying:It will be understood that in these words I am concerned only with the Grade as it isconferred under the obedience of the supreme council of England and Wales, and ofthose other Supreme Councils that are united in using the one form of this Ritual whichis alone of consequence, being concerned with the finding of Christ as the True Word inMasonry.

Taking just such a stance, he once scourgedthe evil occultists from Holy Precincts of the Golden Dawn, and this fact is never farfrom my thoughts as I read him.More to our point, if Crowley has produced a fundamentally flawed interpretationof the Rose-Croix Grade, in the form of the oto 5th degree, then his work is certainlynot unique, at least according to Waite. A comparison to another of its peers, such asthat worked in obedience to the Supreme Council of France, might prove illuminating.JOHN DAYJac Partit responds:I would first say that it is richly ironic that John Day quotes Waite in support of an otoargument. The problem with the New Masonic Encyclopædia is that it is not reliable. Itslimitations are extensively discussed in R A Gilbert’s biography of Waite and I won’trepeat them here. The principle source that I used to inform my remarks was A C FJackson’s history of the Ancient and Accepted Rite published in 1995 to mark the 150thanniversary of the Supreme Council for England and Wales. Let’s move on to thepoints raised one by one:1. Chapter of Clermont. I am afraid that current research suggests that the Chapter ofClermont was entirely mythical. It was created by Pierre de Lintot who attributed it toClermont who was then the Grand Master of French freemasonry. He included sevendegrees that proved to be developed in France in the 1760s and 1770s.2.

The Templar Tradition. A big subject that has kept some dubious authors in royaltiesfor years. Indeed it was, of course, a central feature of the Congress of Wilhelmsbad in1782 which debated Baron Von Hund’s contention that the Order of the Temple hadsurvived and was the creative force behind freemasonry. This claim had been seriouslyundermined in 1782 when it had been formally denied by Charles Edward Stuart,Duke of Albany. The outcome of the Congress was that the case was not proven.Willermoz attended the Congress and was a member of Von Hund’s Order of theStrict Observance. When the Congress concluded with a decision to drop the TemplarClaim Willermoz renamed his “Templar Group” the “Knights Beneficent of the HolyCity” leaving the Ancient and Accepted quite separate and unaffected.4. Martinism. John Day is correct in the sense that “Martinism” as it now exists hasbeen hugely influenced by Louis Claude de Saint-Martin and Papus. In the beginningthere was no initiatic ceremony—Pasqually would have directly transmitted initiationand the ideas that underpin the Cohen workings. Willermoz both knew Pasqually andaccommodated Saint-Martin at a time when he was directly involved in the preparationof the Rose-Croix ritual. My point is that Willermoz would have communicated hisconcern with esoteric Christianity into the 18th degree. That degree is the one thatlargely informs the modern ritual. In France the exoteric symbols of Christianity wereremoved in the 1880s.5. Crowley. I would refer John Day to the Ars Quatuor Coronatorum Vol. 108 whereCrowley’s masonic activities are discussed in some length by Martin Starr."},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"151I can fully understand the negative view of the last paragraph of Waite which is quotedby Mr Day. However, what I object to is the simple lack of effort made in the use of theritual of the 18th degree. It is left as a fundamentally Christian degree with some noveltyeffects. You would think that the founder of a new aeon would have had a better stab atoriginality. After all why does Crowley need freemasonry at all—shouldn’t the oto besomething that strives for a new formulation of ritual? As it is the oto 5th degreeadequately prepares the candidates for the shit that lies at the culmination of the 11°.It is also pertinent to address the endless folly of the Knight Templar myth. Crowleyamong many others failed to fully understand that the legend of the Templars was anouter form of an altogether different struggle. As you know each of the apostles foundedan apostolic succession (or Church). Peter founded the see of Rome but John establishedthe esoteric church from the teaching he received directly. Both the Petrine and Joanninechurches worked from the Vatican and have influenced the Papacy. However, while thePope has emerged from either succession there has been, and always will be, a separateSuccessor of John. The divergence between both factions was at its greatest during theAvingnon Papacy when France took control of the Petrine church. At that time deMolay was promoted as an opponent of Clement V. The Templars retrieved an object,or objects, during the 1st Crusade and returned them to Rome. They were neither heldnor transmitted through the Templar Order. The various oriental influences on theirpractices and their immense wealth have been confused with these original artefacts.By the way Joel, I looked at the book you mentioned on the Templar “Head” [TheHead of God by Keith Laidler—Ed]. It suggested that the proportions of the bodyrepresented on the Turin shroud indicated that the Head was placed on a necklesscorpse and that this head was that which was allegedly worshipped by the Templars. Inthe conclusion it was explained that the most “logical” explanation was that this headwas the embalmed head of Christ. Oh Dear. Going to all the trouble of writing a bookto come up with that. Do I need to describe the rest? It led me to that little diatribeagainst the Templar faction, as I realised that this was the oto Achilles heel. Whateverone feels about the current generated by Crowley it does to me seem strange that he feltthe necessity to align it with a small fringe masonic order (well yes he did need themoney and enjoyed the deference). However, he left a problematic legacy in that hismove could only be credible if the oto represented a hidden occult order that hadsucceeded the Order of the Temple. Undermine that connection and by extension itundermines the whole Thelemic edifice. The reason to my mind is that if the oto isinduced to respond to the allegation that their Templar inheritance is a fraud there isno convincing reply other than the wilder fantasies of the Lincoln/Baigent variety (weare back to the cypher manuscript controversy). Their invective will become more shrill"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"152as their arguments fail to stack up. One then wonders what the point of all of theircobbled together grades and spurious titles is—is it perhaps that this is all there now isin the Order? That the current of the new aeon is elsewhere and all they inherited wasthe dirty washing and teatowels.No modern authentic traditional esoteric order has relied on Templar succession. Ittriumphed as a romantic idea of the 19th century.JAC PARTITThe argument difficult to argueJohn Day mentioned to me privately another argument to do with the symbolism ofthe oto rite, but felt that though this argument was persuasive it was not proper toallow it to enter the debate and amiably conceded Jac Partit’s points. I may hint darklyat the other argument by reminding readers that some hold that the “true” origin of theterm “Rosicrucian” is sexual and that the “rose” is a blind inserted into the symbolism toconceal the sexual nature of the “alchemical process”, that actually it is the “ros” (Latin,“dew”) of the Cross.It should also be pointed out that technically the Order of Oriental Templars do nottoday claim Templar succession, even though they rather lackadaisically imply it. I onceasked Bill Heidrick of the Caliphate oto on the alt.magick newsgroup what exactlywere the claims of the Caliphate oto to have descended from anything. I did actuallyintend to imply a question more to do with the controversy of the origin of the Caliphateas opposed to the oto per se, but nonetheless though he dodged that his answer is ofinterest:Mainly from the Hermetic Brotherhood of Luxor, with absorption or influence from awhole slue of other organizations cited by Crowley in the Blue Equinox, including verydistant or mythical influences such as the Illuminati. Those last are demonstratedprecursors only in the sense of the influence on the general European culture. KnightsTemplar is in that category, at best.It needs to be said that Aleister Crowley himself, for all of his plagiarism or “adaption”,did envisage that the oto’s rites would be performed with style and was only too awarebefore his death that they were becoming empty imitations.

In the course of it he shows the effect he intended his rituals tohave, suggesting that the Minerval degree (0°)—a dialogue based on a prisoner beingbrought before Saladin at his desert encampment—did not have to take place in alodge setting and that they should be more adventurous in interpreting these rites:... you have not succeeded in putting on even the Minerval degree in such a way that itwill stand out as a landmark in the life of anyone who goes through it. This is particularlyirritating to me because you have an actual desert conveniently handy [the Mojave—Ed]. You ought to warn the candidate when you accept him that he must expect to besummoned for initiation at any hour of the day or night. He should then be calledprobably after sunset and driven out as far as you can reasonably manage to the desert,which he should reach by the time that it is thoroughly dark. He should then be seized,blindfolded and bound by the Black Guard who are conducting him—rather roughlythan otherwise—to the tent in front of which the Saladin is seated behind an altar withThe Book of the Law and other necessaries of the ritual.This is only a rough idea of the sort of thing, but you have got to impress the man. Ifyou don’t the whole business becomes foolishness. Then when you get on to the FirstDegree, if he has been rightly initiated, he ought to be prepared for further strokes wherehe feels it most. The well must be properly constructed; it is no good having a grotesquemakeshift. I hear that in some cases officers have actually read their parts in the ritual,which is absolutely disgraceful. You have no idea how much time and trouble it gives meto cut down those rituals so that it would be reasonably possible for men to learn them byheart under modern conditions. If you compare these rituals with those of Freemasonryyou should all be ashamed of yourselves. Consider the long and dreary lectures that theyall had to get absolutely by heart and I am sure that the discipline in Masonic Lodges issuch that the whole of my life I have never known an officer even to falter.Now the Fifth Degree is a most complicated and expensive rite. I do not think youcould get the furniture for less than $500; perhaps the way prices are nowadays $1,000might be nearer.

The onslaughtof compulsive weirdness in Grant’s work is unrelenting, filled with jumpy fast-cuts thatremind one less of text than television: H P Lovecraft’s House Party. Each chapter anemetic gush of curdling chthonic biles and juices served up steaming, a hot shrapnel ofideas, intense and indiscriminate. A shotgun full of snails and amethysts dischargedpoint blank into the reader’s face.The difficulty in assessing Kenneth Grant as writer is compounded by his stance asmagus which, quite properly, insists upon the personal and the subjective, making itimpossible to view his writings without reference to Grant himself, the atmosphere ofhis peculiar mind hung in a churning fogbank over every page. A mere fifteen, Grantblundered into the fluorescent vortex of Aleister Crowley via a copy of Magick in Theoryand Practice discovered in a Charing Cross Road bookshop. Three years later, agedeighteen, Grant joined the army “with the expectation of being sent to India, where Ihad hopes of finding a guru”. Given that Grant’s enlistment took place at the height ofWorld War II, this statement would seem to suggest a grasp upon conventional worldlyreality that was at best precarious. Eighteen months after setting out on his unusualkhaki path towards enlightenment, Grant suffered an unspecified “health breakdown”and was discharged from the forces. During convalescence, he wrote to the JermynStreet address listed in Crowley’s Book of Thoth, and subsequently entered into first acorrespondence and then, later, full apprenticeship with the Great Beast.Grant, at the time, was barely twenty, while the Master Therion was in his earlyseventies, a magus down to his last chants and just about to settle into premises atNetherwood in Hastings, Crowley’s terminal address. The details of the correspondenceand relationship are to be found in Grant’s Remembering Aleister Crowley, an entrancingblend of fannish scrapbook and The Screwtape Letters, published by Skoob Books in1991. The frequently exasperated tone of Crowley’s letters to his younger acolyte suggestsa Thelemic Laurel and Hardy routine: Stan fails to magickally identify a channelleddrawing of the entity called lam. In retaliation, Olly knocks Stan’s bowler hat off andthen treads on it. Stan scratches his head and weeps.In spite of such one-sided spats between the hapless Grant and his impossiblydemanding tutor, Crowley penned a memo during 1946 to the following effect: “Valueof Grant: if I die or go to USA, there must be a trained man to take care of the Englishoto.” This memo is one of the building blocks supporting Grant’s succession to the"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"157leadership of what is now called the Typhonian oto, a wilfully chthonic enterprise thatseems devoted to exploring Magic’s darker countenance; its subterranean underbelly.Clearly, these psychic cave-diving expeditions have done much to generate the slightlycreepy, claustrophobic aura that perfumes the reputation of both Grant and hisorganisation. It’s not so much that the Typhonian oto has “something of the night”about it, more that it gargles with the stuff, splashes it underneath both arms and downits underpants, a schoolboy gone berserk on brimstone aftershave.Hardly surprising, then, that this relentlessly infernal posture should elicit comment,much of it adverse. As an example, occult writer Gerald Suster has described Grant andhis circle as “wallowing in Qlipothic slime”, and while this might sound like a perfectlygood Saturday night out to you or I, it seems to be intended as a criticism. Grant, itmust be said, does not bend over backwards to contradict this impression. Each newpublished work contains a further mapping of his inner, magic landscape that exposesmore of its bizarre nocturnal landmarks, its unutterable flora and fauna: mauve zones,ninth arches and tunnels of Set; leapers and Outer Gods and elementals in the form ofmonstrous aquatic owls. The ingress of alien information through the knowledge-gateof the eleventh Sephiroth. Mind parasites. Neural invaders. Great Cthulhu. Anapparently deliberate blurring of the line between describing Separate Reality and writingMagic Fiction, if there ever really was a line to blur.This brings us to Against the Light, ostensibly a novel rather than a book of writingsabout magic, issued in a limited hardback edition of a thousand by Starfire PublishingLtd. From the word go the novel, if novel it be, adopts an unapologetically ambiguousposition. Nowhere on its jacket or within do we find any notice that Against the Light ismeant to be received as fiction. The only description of its content that we find is in thevolume’s cryptic subtitle: A Nightside Narrative.The text itself, of course, only confounds the matter further. From the openingdedication to Grant’s great-uncle, one Phineas Marsh Black, we are immersed withinthe question that has surely haunted every reader of Grant’s earlier writings: just howmuch of this is supposed to be... you know... real? The prologue talks of “Uncle Phin”and Grant’s great-cousin Gregor, seemingly also a relative of Crowley’s and an actualperson, his existence at least vouched for elsewhere in Grant’s oeuvre of avowed non-fiction. From here we trip lightly through a brief discussion of Clan Grant and anunusual family heirloom in the form of a forbidden book known as Grant’s Grimoire,this being a record of the quaint, longstanding family tradition of “traffic with entitiesnot of this world”. The author helpfully informs us that “there exists to this day in thelibrary of a Florentine family an Italian version, Il Grimoire Grantiano.”Scarcely have we had time to absorb this stylish continental touch than we are"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"158introduced to yet another member of Clan Grant, this time an ancestor named MargaretWyard who, the author gleefully informs us, is alleged to have claimed carnal knowledgeof the Devil in a bestial form at ufo hotspot Rendlesham Forest during the sixteenthcentury. Just as we’re starting to appreciate how much fun Christmas family reunions atthe Grant place must have been, we’re whisked away into the body of a narrative wherethe first person author and a scryer-for-hire named Margaret Leesing attempt to solvethe interlocking mysteries of Margaret Wyard and the grimoire, leading them into theworld of shrieking cosmic horror where Grant at least seems to feel most at home,most thoroughly relaxed.Nothing about the style of Grant’s delivery throughout the book distinguishes Againstthe Light from the preceding non-fictional work. The author’s voice has the sameworryingly straight-faced tone to which the readers have become accustomed, and insteadof any novelistic structure we see Grant employ his usual device of sweeping a vast pileof fascinating information up into one place, then chopping it out arbitrarily into asemblance of individual chapters. Characters familiar from Grant’s previous work recur:Crowley himself, along with Austin Osman Spare, Yeld Paterson and Black Eagle,Spare’s famous spirit guide. The anecdotes describing ritual events and states are notintrinsically more unbelievable than those to be found in Grant’s earlier work, exceptthat here they occupy more space. Presenting his account, the author does not seem lessearnest or less anxious to convince than he seems in Nightside of Eden or Outside theCircles of Time.Given the above, attempting to critique Against the Light by the same terms onewould apply to, say, a current horror-fantasy novella would seem both redundant andunfair. Should we then treat the book as an expanded ritual journal, a straightforwardpiece of magical reportage, only differing from Grant’s previous work in its ratio ofanecdote to ideology? Again, this presents difficulties, not least being that alongside allthe genuine occult celebrities woven into Grant’s tale we also find clearly fictitiouspersonages such as Helen Vaughn, half-human heroine of Arthur Machen’s work TheGreat God Pan, or Richard Pickman, the doomed artist spirited away by ghouls in H PLovecraft’s Pickman’s Model. Throw in Sin Sin Wa, an astral Chinaman who seems tobe the model for Sax Rohmer’s Fu Manchu, and one begins to grasp the full dimensionof the problem.Complicating matters is the nature of the narrative itself, with certain passagesapparently intended to take place somewhere at least within the vague proximity ofordinary reality, while other parts plunge us into scryed scenes from history or else full-fledged shamanic visions. Furthermore, Grant seldom bothers to make the transitionbetween one state and another absolutely clear and, indeed, seems to see the different"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"159planes of narrative as pretty interchangeable. We’re dragged, with the narrator, fromthe glittering hallucinatory bowels of a Lovecraftian underworld, through West EndLondon and into the scrying bowl, often within a page. Adding to the disorientingnature of the tale is the narrator’s almost total lack of any recognisable emotional reactionto the Bosch-like apparitions he is constantly confronted by. The literary influence ofLovecraft, obviously a writer much admired by Grant, shows here in the flatness ofhuman characterisation when compared to the vivid and chop-smacking depictions ofthe narrative’s squamous, trans-human horrors.This lack of emotional response, if we are dealing with an actual account of Grant’sexperiences rather than fantastic fiction, conveys an absence of affect that turns thelandscape of the prose, merely hallucinatory before, into a genuinely psychopathic vista,both obsessive and unsettling. But are we dealing, here, with real experience? If so, realin what sense? Is this a standard horror yarn with an authoritative occult gloss? Is thisthe fleshed-out record of a ritual working, or a glimpse into the marvellous rubbish leftby the collapse of an extraordinary mind? Just what in hell, exactly, are we looking at?Obviously, the simplest course of action would be to conclude that Grant’s workrepresents no more than funny-coloured bedlam froth, a warning to the rest of us aboutwhat happens when you start believing outré things and hang round with AleisterCrowley. This, however, leads us back to our original dilemma: if Grant’s opus can beneatly summed up as merely incoherent ravings, why do most occultists that I know,myself included, have more or less everything that Grant has ever published resting onour shelves? Also, how shall we square a view of Grant as foaming lunatic with thesame Kenneth Grant who has contributed so much of worth to the contemporary occultworldview? Without Grant to champion the then-all-but-forgotten works of his friendAustin Osman Spare, the artist would now be remembered as a minor fantasist whosometimes did the odd impressive nude (this was the view advanced in the dismissive,limp obituary notices that Spare’s contemporary critics heaped upon him). WithoutGrant’s insistence that the works of H P Lovecraft represented valid channels of magicalinformation, much of the furniture and landscape of our modern magic systems, Chaosmagic for example, would be utterly unrecognisable. A sasquatch at a vicarage tea-party, Grant is too big to dismiss, too weird to feel entirely comfortable about. Whatshall we make of Kenneth Grant?The answer, if indeed there is an answer, might lie part-concealed within Against theLight’s seemingly cryptic subtitle, A Nightside Narrative. Is this a simple flourish, amere gothic affectation, or could it be an attempt to provide a label that is both moreaccurate and more explanatory than plain unvarnished “fiction”?Let us pause here to consider the essential nature of Grant’s contributions to the"},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"160world of Magic. From his advocacy of the works of Spare and Lovecraft to this latestoffering, it’s difficult not to perceive a man deeply in love with what Sax Rohmerchristened the Romance of Sorcery. This is not to label Grant a fantasist in the pejorativesense: there’s a good case to be made for the position that fiction, romance and fantasyhave always been the cornerstone of Magic theory. From the first cave-wall surrealismof Palaeolithic shamans, through the visionary poetry of Blake and the vastly important,almost-free-associational synthesis of occult ideas constructed by Eliphas Levi, on toCrowley and Blavatsky, to the Lovecraft/Moorcock tropes of the Chaos magicians,what we see acknowledged is the staggering supernatural power of creative imagination.Might not the entire of Magic be described as traffic between That Which Is andThat Which Is Not; between fact and fiction? If we are to speak of Magic as “The Art”,should we not also speak of Art as Magic? Even Crowley tellingly and rather poignantlydescribes great artists as superior to great magicians. Crowley also points out theconnection that exists between a grimoire and a grammar, between casting spells andspelling; goes so far as to admit, at one point, that the greater part of magical activitylies in simply writing about it. Clearly there is a reason why Hermes and Thoth, theGods of Magic, should be simultaneously the Gods of Writing.The magician conjures angels or else demons, out of nothingness into manifestation,while the novelist does likewise with her ideas and her characters. Again we have acommerce between the existent and the non-existent, something out of nothingness,the rabbit from an empty hat that is perhaps the very crux of magical endeavour.The intensely beautiful and elegant schema described by the Qabala, which rests atthe fulcrum of Western Occult Tradition, speaks of the ninth, lunar sphere of Yesod asthe gate through which all energies from higher stations on the Tree of Life pour downinto material form and manifest existence. Yesod, as the sphere of the unconsciousmind, is thus the well from which both the magician and the artist draw. Thoughsituated “higher” than the earthly and material sphere of Malkuth on the Qabalisticdiagram, Yesod at the same time represents the underworld of our subconscious andoneiric faculties, the eerie and chthonic realm of Hecate upon which Grant and hisTyphonian oto lavish their magical attention. These are the bone-strewn caves thatrest beneath the deepest cellars of Jung’s mansion of the human soul, the dark pitswhere all dreams and magics spawn. All fictions and insanities born in the queer lightof a buried moon: this is the Nightside.We may read this as the metaphor upon which the subtitle of Against the Lightdepends.

A blurred spot between the actual and the imaginary. Sometimes things comethrough. Sometimes, things trade position with their own reflection. Real works ofMagic are exposed as fictions. Works of fiction are revealed as Magic. Yelda Patersonwinks knowingly at Helen Vaughn and Anna Sprengel. If a witch or sorcerer be ofsufficient magnitude and power, the fact that he or she be also fictional should not proveany great impediment.Viewed in this crepuscular light, the ambiguities that haunt Grant’s book can beresolved. This is not a work of fiction, nor is it authentic Magic documentary. Instead,it is both of those things, shaped by an understanding that the territory of the fantasticis of singular importance to the magus. The subterranean landscape of the Unreal yieldsa lush, fertile environment, pregnant with possibility, that will sustain both occultistand artist.

YellowBrick Road-kill.Then again, it might be argued that no true, authentic magic insight is achievablewithout considerable risk. Kenneth Grant’s books, despite or possibly because of theirforays into dementia, have more genuine occult power than works produced by moreconventionally coherent authors, and are certainly a more engrossing read.

Basically,tunnels, mud, and mosquitoes, and a lone pipestrelle bat. To add substance to what isotherwise a book of archæological psychometry without the slightest scrap of evidencein 500 pages that these tunnels were ever put to the stated use as an oracular model ofthe Underworld, he is reduced to the device of “seeming to see in my mind’s eye”.

She’s about30 and has one blue eye and one green. Nearby there’s an older woman, apparently theretired Sybil. And then he has the gall to round off this farcical stage-management ofthe reader’s gullibility with the statement: “Of course, all this may be pure fantasy, andquite likely it is.” But naturally the desired interpretation of a bunch of dirty old tunnelsbegins to gel in the reader’s mind. And who is he writing for, that he finds it necessaryto point out the depth to which ancient divinatory practices have penetrated modernlanguage by explaining that the word “portentous” comes from “portent” and “fateful”from “fate”.Temple likes to present himself as a respected scholar, but scratch the surface and itis just a veneer, an appearance not hard to achieve if you have a good library and knowhow to create an impression of being well-read. Temple uses his learning not toprofoundly advance the sum total of human knowledge but rather to fulfil a publishingcontract.

It is a sacred text whose words come not from God but from the sagely foundersof the dynasty—culture heroes elevated almost to the status of gods by Confucius andhis school. According to tradition, the earliest layers of the text were written by Chang,crowned posthumously as Wen, first king of the Zhou dynasty, in the 11th century bc.This attribution was not seriously questioned until the introduction of the criticalapparatus of scientific methodology into China in the 20th century. Questions of originwere first raised by such scholars as Gu Jiegang and Li Jingchi in the 1930s, and sincethen the academic world has considered the sagely authorship of the Yijing to be thestuff of myth and legend. In the book under review, S J Marshall attempts to overturnthis “complete disavowal of tradition” (p 7) by uncovering historical references to thefounding fathers that have remained hidden in the cryptic text for thousands of years.The book’s ultimate argument hinges on the author’s interpretation of the text ofhexagram 55 H, “Feng” (]). Two lines in the hexagram depict the Big Dipperconstellation appearing in the middle of the day, which is only possible during a totaleclipse of the sun, according to some. Marshall’s brilliant insight is to identify the wordfeng in the same lines not as the common word for “abundance”, which is the standardinterpretation, but as the name of the capital city of Zhou, a feudal state at the westernperiphery of the ancient kingdom of Shang. Chang, Chief of the West, had begun toconsolidate his power and move his sphere of influence toward the east at this time, butdied unexpectedly soon after founding his new capital at Feng. Marshall deduces thatChang’s son, Fa, saw the eclipse as a sign or “mandate” from Heaven that he was chosento lead the rebellion against the evil Shou, last king of Shang. A check by Marshall ofmodern research verifies the occurrence of a total eclipse in northern China aroundnoon on June 20, 1070 bc, a year that was also calculated by 4th century bc calendrical"},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"166scholars to have been the time of the conquest. Section I of the book, “The Mandate ofHeaven”, frames this basic argument and buttresses it with clever readings from otherhexagram texts.Section II, “Further Mysteries of the Changes”, continues the same line of reasoningby seeking in other hexagrams historical references to events of the conquest. For example,hexagram 36 U, “Ming Yi” (HI), has always baffled scholars. Ming, an ideographcomposed of the pictographs for the sun and the moon, usually means “bright” or “light”.Yi is the pictograph of an arrow with a cord tied around the shaft and means “to wound,injure”. Since many of the lines in the hexagram clearly picture a bird being hunted,modern scholars have speculated that mingyi is the forgotten name of a bird, specificallythe “calling pheasant”. Marshall does not completely refute this interpretation, but hebelieves the literal meaning of wounding or “darkening” the light refers also to thephenomenon of the eclipse. To bolster his reading he makes another brilliant deduction,this time in reference to an ancient Chinese myth. The earliest variant of a popularmyth asks literally “why did the Great Archer shoot the sun” and, after having done so,“why did the crow lose its feathers” (my translation). The standard answer, verified inlater variants of the myth, is because there were ten suns in the sky whose intensity wasscorching the earth. Feathers scattered because the ten suns were in reality ten sun-ravens who roosted in the east before one normally took flight every morning of theten-day week. Marshall believes the later versions of the myth were accretions meant toexplain an occurrence whose purpose had been totally forgotten, namely, that the mythicalarcher shot at the black bird who had eaten the sun, thus killing it and releasing the sunfrom the eclipse.Section III of the book is a collection of five appendices that clarifies such things as“genealogical matters” (the family tree of King Wen), the “sexagenary cycle” (the sixty-term numbering system of the ancient Chinese), and the “sinological maze of Wilhelm-Baynes” (the puzzling format of the most popular English translation of the Yijing, thatby Richard Wilhelm and Cary Baynes). Following this last section are over fifty pagesof notes, an extensive bibliography of Western language works on the Yijing and relatedsubjects, and a comprehensive index.S J Marshall’s intriguing work will be read with great interest by Yijing aficionados,and it will also attract the attention of contemporary scholars. The former will beimmensely grateful for the clarity that Marshall brings to such an enigmatic text. Thelatter will initially scoff at the absence of Chinese language sources and point out acontradiction here or an anachronism there before grudgingly admitting that the thesisis basically sound. Everyone who reads The Mandate of Heaven will return to the Book ofChanges with a renewed historical perspective."},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"167“Why did Yi the Archer shoot at the sun?

Jack Parsons of course did not live much pastthe halfway mark, being blown up at the age of 37 in his Pasadena coachhouse on June17, 1952. It is usually said that he dropped a vial of the detonator fulminate of mercury,but cordite may have been involved, and details are sketchy not to say suspicious. Hewas apparently moving explosives for transportation on a “vacation” to Mexico with hiswife, his “elemental mate” Marjorie Cameron, who was around the corner buying suppliesfor a picnic when the explosion happened. Possibly it was murder by a Captain Kynette,a car bomber Parsons testified against in 1938 who had recently been paroled, the theoryis discussed in the book, towards the end, by which time Parsons has grown into a veryinteresting man indeed. Certainly Marjorie Cameron, who died in 1995 of cancer aged73, an excellent artist, wrote in the Caliphate oto journal The Magical Link that shebelieved it was murder and implied it was Kynette. Cameron played the Scarlet Womanand Kali in Kenneth Anger’s 38 minute film Inauguration of the Pleasure Dome (1954,recut in 1966 in a version intended to be watched on magic mushrooms).Well-known to occultists for his 1946 Babalon Working, at which time he had studiedmagick for seven years and had supervised at the Agapé Lodge of the oto in Californiafor four, Parsons’ life as a rocket scientist is not so well studied. Much of the first half ofthe book is taken up with it, and, though important in getting a true picture of Jack—John to friends at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory—Parsons, I must admit I did find itbogged down in rocket fuel burn-times and it will not be the main focus of attentionhere.

Previously the onlyserious work of biographical research had been Michael Staley’s essay “The BabalonWorking/Belovèd of Babalon”, which I remember eagerly reading in Starfire 3 back in1989 in the aftermath of the kaos-babalon working. At this time in London, Parsonswas spoken about by occultists with deep respect and love, here was a guy who “was outthere man”. When I read the description of how the explosion tore off his right forearm,broke his other arm and both legs, and left a “gaping hole” in his jaw and shredded hisshoes, leaving him conscious for a further 37 minutes before he died, I was quite shocked,never having read that before. There’s the standard witticism about the crater on thedark side of the moon that was named after him, and how they must have got the ideafrom the crater he left in his coachhouse floor, but Carter’s graphic description made itfresh and serious, especially Parsons’ last words as reported by Jet Propulsion Laboratoryarchivist John Bluth: “I wasn’t done.” (Curious words given that he proclaimed himself“The Antichrist” in 1949 and one of the seven recorded versions of Christ’s last wordson the cross was: “It is finished.” [John 19:30]. These were the last words used inScorsese’s movie. Marjorie Cameron apparently said Jack’s last words were: “Who willtake care of me now?”) On hearing of his death, Parsons’ mother Ruth committedsuicide, adding fuel to the ugly rumour concerning his “exteriorization” of the Oedipalcomplex and the peculiar home movies, involving also the family dog, that may or maynot exist, which Shedona Chevalier of babalon.net has taken publisher Adam Parfreyto task for including a paragraph about.These days you can find a copy of Parsons’ Book of Babalon in seconds off the Internet,but part of its attraction for me 15 years ago was that you really had to track it down, itwas seriously sought-after material, a treasure map of sorts that you might find a dog-eared mimeographed copy of in a friend’s collection that had been much read and passedaround, and sometimes pencil-annotated by several hands, which probably made itseem a lot better than it may appear now to the short-attention-span generation whoskim it rather than study it. When Michael Staley published it in Starfire along with hisessay many people were grateful for that.Staley’s essay, however, contains a stupendous error that has led most who have readhis influential work into a complete misapprehension of Parsons’ Babalon Working.Sex and Rockets mentions and corrects the error, repeated by others since 1989, althoughCarter does not attribute its source, which may not ultimately have originated withStaley. Even so, on reviewing the material again for the first time in years—not onlyCarter’s book—I found it hard to credit how Staley could have got it so wrong. Parsons,"},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"170as he states in The Book of Babalon, began his Babalon Working on January 4, 1946,which was designed to obtain the assistance of an elemental mate. Aiding him in thisoperation at first as “Scribe” was L Ron Hubbard, who later absconded with Parsons’fortune. After a daily sequence of Enochian operations and other invocations, on January18, at sunset in the Mojave desert, after four days of tension the feeling suddenly snappedand Parsons turned to Hubbard and said: “It is done.” He was absolutely certain thatthe current phase of the operation had been accomplished. Returning home he foundMarjorie Cameron, a fiery redhead who was 23 at the time, waiting for him. They hadmet before, and she had turned up to visit him at just this moment knowing nothing ofhis Babalon Working.Parsons recognised Cameron as fulfilling the intent of his magical operation and hewrote to Aleister Crowley informing him that he had his elemental. Parsons records inThe Book of Babalon: “During the period of January 19 to February 27 I invoked thegoddess babalon with the aid of my magical partner.” This is the sentence that MichaelStaley inexplicably misinterpreted, for some reason he believed that Parsons’ “magicalpartner”, despite Marjorie Cameron turning up, was still his “Scribe” L Ron Hubbardand he emphasised this in no uncertain terms. Of course, it was actually Cameron, who,according to Carter, said that the first two weeks of this period were spent in bed withJack, although Carter does not cite where this information may be found, presumably aletter from Cameron to Jane Wolfe or an interview that he mentions in the back of thebook but does not specify clearly. Cameron apparently related that the two of themtalked incessantly during this period: “He educated me... that’s what he was supposedto do.” He made her aware that she “had a mission in the world”. Even with Parsons’sparse wording in The Book of Babalon, it’s hard to see how Staley could have so misreadthe situation to have written: “It is notable that, even with the advent of MarjorieCameron, he continued to regard Hubbard as being his magical partner.” I no longerhave Starfire 3 to check, but the version of Staley’s essay on the web inserts Hubbard’sname in parentheses in Parsons’ sentence after “magical partner”. Possibly this is Staley’sinsertion, giving the impression it appears in the original, or it reflects a mistakeninterpolation in the copy of The Book of Babalon that Staley was working from that hesimply passed on without thinking it through. It would be interesting to know whetherhe still believes in this version of events, given that his essay has not been revised orannotated for the web (http://www.mysunrise.ch/users/prkoenig/staley/staley11.htm).Staley’s error is doubly hard to comprehend since Parsons states quite clearly in TheBook of Babalon, in the section headed “Birth”, dated March 2, 1946, that the Scribe“knew nothing of my invocations of babalon, which I had kept entirely secret”.Although Hubbard had a good idea of his activities, this sentence ought surely to have"},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"171alerted Staley to the fact that Parsons’ magical partner from Jan 19 to Feb 27 wasobviously Cameron. The only way Staley could have read this without having the truthdawn on him would have been to assume Parsons was referring solely to his receptionof Liber 49 on February 28 rather than to the entire sequence of events since MarjorieCameron turned up on January 18. In fact, one wonders what exactly Staley thoughtCameron’s role in the Babalon Working actually was (interesting to reflect whether thisis a general Typhonian oto misunderstanding as well). Final confirmation that themagical partner was Cameron appears in a letter Parsons wrote to Crowley on March 6,1946, in which he says: “I have had the most devastating experience of my life betweenFeb 2 and Mar 4. I believe it was the result of the 9th working with the girl who answeredmy elemental summons.” (A reference to 9° sex magick.) The two weeks between Jan19 and Feb 2 corresponds with the time Cameron said they spent mostly in bed andchatted incessantly, foreplay for the 9th you might say.Parsons’ Liber 49, 77 verses forming part of The Book of Babalon (four verses, 5–8,missing) presented in the section “Communications”, was received by Parsons alone inthe Mojave desert on February 28, the day after Cameron had returned to New Yorkfor a couple of weeks, during which she ditched her boyfriend Napoleon. It is in verse23 of Liber 49 that Babalon instructs him to seek her in the Seventh Aire, which wasmentioned earlier in KAOS in that Parsons blundered here in his subsequent invocationand sought her instead by using the 7th Call rather than the 25th Call (ie, the 19th Call,or Call of the 30 Aires, with deo substituted for lil, to open the 7th Aire). It was shortlyafter receiving Liber 49, on March 2, that Hubbard as Scribe delivered his famouschilling prophecy to Parsons: “thou shalt become living flame before She incarnates.”Given Carter’s correction of the mistake concerning the identity of Parsons’ magicalpartner until February 27, it is ironic that on p 139 he says the role of the priestess,changed to “Babalon” by Parsons, in the enactment of a section of the Gnostic Mass onMarch 2 was recited by Cameron. Unless he has other information he has not impartedit seems to me she was still in New York at that time (a clumsy error since on p 132Carter says Cameron went to New York on Feb 27 and stayed 2 weeks, which is it tobe?). The Book of Babalon itself gives the impression that the Scribe Hubbard must havetaken the role, or Parsons both roles. The priestess role here is almost identical to LiberAL I, v 61. Carter on p 142 speculates that Parsons and Cameron took turns recitinglines from Crowley’s play Tannhäuser in the sixth invocation, again forgetting that hesaid she was in New York. If he can’t get basic things like this correct, it does unfortunatelycall into question the book’s reliability. For the record concerning Cameron’s whereaboutsat this time, Parsons wrote to Crowley on February 22, 1946: “One thing I seem to havemy elemental. She turned up one night after the conclusion of the operation and has"},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"172been with me since, though she goes back to New York next week. She has red hair andslant green eyes as specified.” (Russell Miller’s account of the phase of the working afterFeb 28 in Bare-Faced Messiah, his biography of Hubbard, is a product of his ownimagination. The version in L Ron Hubbard: Messiah or Madman?, by Bent Corydonand L Ron Hubbard Jr, is also misleading.)Carter’s book, particularly in its dealings with the Babalon Working and thecircumstances of Parsons’ death, and also the peripheral influence of Jack Williamson’swerewolf novel Darker Than You Think on the way Parsons envisaged Babalon, is wellworth reading despite its sparsity of source citation and slapdash errors (another one:on p 116 he equates Babalon to Chokmah rather than Binah). On a small but interestingpoint, Carter mentions one odd coincidence in the Babalon Working I hadn’t noticedbefore. In The Book of Babalon, on January 10 1946, Parsons writes that after his Enochianinvocations he was awakened at 12 pm by nine loud knocks and a table lamp in theopposite corner of the room was thrown violently to the floor, there was no window byit nor any wind. Carter points out that given that L Ron Hubbard was Parsons’ Scribeat this time it is curious that there is an Enochian word “Hubard”, which means “livinglamps”. Actually this is a slight error that appears to be attributable to Israel Regardie’sEnochian Dictionary (as published in Enochian Sex Magick by Duquette and Hyatt),the actual word for “living lamps” used in the 17th Key is “hubaro”. Nonetheless, “hubar”is the stem for “lamp” or “lantern” in Enochian, and it is conceivable that the Enochianspirits, by knocking nine times and throwing a lamp to the floor, were by this omenattempting to warn Parsons about Hubbard. Parsons admits himself inexperienced insuch phenomena; he saw it simply as the result of imperfect magical technique (I supposehe means a kind of turbulence) and didn’t consider investing the event with significanceor interpreting its meaning. While on the one hand it is fully explainable away (heheard the knocks in a dream, the lamp was already unstable, he awoke with a start, thevibration tipped the lamp), for a Master of the Temple it is an obligation to look deeplyinto the significance of even the most inconsequential of events, so how much more soan apparently supernatural occurrence during the timespan of an occult working. Andwhile Parsons had not at that time taken the Oath of the Abyss, it is surprising he wasnot more familiar with omen phenomena, because in any case most true omens take afar more mundane form and it is the state of consciousness of the one experiencing theomen that recognises its significance as an omen.Although Crowley’s final assessment of Parsons as a “weak-minded fool”, despiteearlier regarding him as a man of great potential, may in some respects be accurate(although it is more that he was over-trusting and enthusiastic), I found on revisitingmy interest in him that he still held a great deal of allure. He went over the edge with"},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"173his bizarre Antichrist manifesto, and some parts of Liber 49 betray perhaps an imperfectreception—“Am I thy village queen and thou a sophomore, that thou shouldst have thynose in my buttocks?”—but as an occultist Parsons was plugged in to the live currentlike few ever are. Carter pronounces his scientific achievements as underrated, and thisis certainly so, but he also believes that as an occultist he was a failure. I don’t personallybelieve so, because “failure” too can be a noble inspiration and ultimately depends onhow you look at it. Who knows how many occultists have felt strangely inspired byParsons’ and Cameron’s “failure”. In a final letter to oto head Karl Germer, Parsonswrote tongue-in-cheek of the great successes of his magical workings in terms of acutepsychosis, manic hysteria, and depressing melancholic stupors, and that “satisfactoryprogress has been maintained in social ostracism, economic collapse and mentaldisassociation”, and that these statements should be taken as “comfort and inspirationto other aspirants on the Path”. He signs off by saying “you can tell all the little practicusesI wouldn’t have missed it for anything”. (Practicus is 3° in the A∴A∴)More confusing is what Parsons expected to achieve beyond attracting his “elementalmate”. It is easy to think that Marjorie Cameron was the Babalon he sought, and sheherself in later years believed so (either that or she had given birth to “Her” on theastral, whether Babalon or Daughter of Babalon, it all gets a bit vague), yet Parsonshimself appeared to have been awaiting some form of incarnation who, possibly, wouldcome to him with a sign or sigil that he would recognise—Crowley supposed from thereports he had received from others in the oto that Parsons was producing a Moonchildand felt it was “idiocy”. Parsons was instructed to receive the sign by gazing for an hourupon a black box he had earlier been told to make, and he would see “a shape, a sign, asacred design” appear imprinted on it. He was to construct this sigil in wood. I havenever read anywhere anything further about this sigil or whether it survives. By the signhe would recognise that “babalon is born!” How this was supposed to pan out is unclear.Did Parsons expect someone to be born as a result of his Working who when theyreached adulthood would come and visit him flashing a sigil? Possibly, in The Book ofBabalon he is told on March 2, 1946, via the Scribe: “Speak not of this ritual or of Hercoming to any person. If asked, answer in a manner that avoids suspicion. Nor speculateat any time as to Her future mortal identity.” Or did he expect something much sooner?Carter says on p 151 that Marjorie Cameron found she was pregnant by Parsons buthad an abortion with his consent (again, without backing it up with a source), andanother abortion later on, which makes one wonder what kind of incarnation he wasseeking and also at what point he confided in her the full extent of his magical objective,because at first he kept from her that he considered her to be an elemental he hadconjured up to help him fulfil this seemingly hazy objective."},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"174In the aftermath of the 1946 Babalon Working and Hubbard’s betrayal,disillusionment set in and for two years Parsons gave up magick, throwing himself intohis scientific work, until his security clearance was temporarily withdrawn. Carter sayshe lost his clearance May 17, 1948 (p 159), but according to the 141 page fbi file thatwas actually the date the investigation began into his membership of a religious cultand friendship with an alleged Communist Party member (the name is censored fromthe file), his security clearance wasn’t actually lost until September 29, 1948, the decisionbeing reversed on March 7, 1949. Parsons claimed in a letter to Germer dated June 19,1949, that one of the reasons for his suspension—which is confirmed therein as occurringin September 1948—was because of his circulation of Crowley’s Liber Oz, but this isn’tactually mentioned in the fbi file. Some time after the loss of his clearance, Cameronleft him and the separation, which was temporary, involved the estrangement of mostof his friends, this too he notes in the aforementioned letter to Germer. The fbi filedescribes Jack’s home as “a gathering place of perverts” and notes that this was “fairlycommon knowledge among scientists in the Pasadena area”. And it seems the oto and“Church of Thelma [sic]” received its orders from “Sir Allister [sic] Crowley” in London,England. The Book of the Law, according to the fbi, “tears down everything democracystands for”.After his loss of fortune, reputation, and livelihood, Babalon called on Parsons againin a dream and he learnt it was time to embark upon the “Black Pilgrimage” spoken ofin Liber 49. He swore the Oath of the Abyss, “having only the choice between madness,suicide, and that oath”, a good indication that he had arrived at the edge of the Abyss ifnothing else. As a result, he realised he was the Antichrist.In his 1949 Manifesto of the Antichrist Parsons writes that in seven years Babalon willmanifest in the world (he also says that in nine years a nation shall accept the Law ofthe Beast 666 in his name). Again, one presumes that he expected either the birth of achild or an actual woman who was Babalon completely and utterly—notwithstandingthat a woman is when the spirit of Babalon comes upon her—and that he expected Heras some Christian Fundamentalists expect the Apocalypse and cannot reconcile that afar more subtle but nonetheless powerful change that fulfils this description may havealready been and gone, for those with greater awareness. (There’s even a word for it, a“preterist”, one who holds the prophecies of the Apocalypse already fulfilled.) In this,maybe it’s to be expected that Parsons sought an incarnate Babalon, an avatar, if Crowleywas The Beast 666 and he himself The Antichrist (Nietzsche had already fulfilled thisrole with a more eloquent denunciation of Christianity than Parsons’ own 2 page tiradeagainst such timeless iniquities as “lying priests, conniving judges, blackmailing police”and mention of his scary invocation of Satan at the age of 13). Yet despite the insanity"},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"175of his Manifesto of the Antichrist, Parsons mercifully appears quite lucid and together inhis letters to Cameron between October 1949 and February 1950—during theirtemporary estrangement and near divorce—in which he addresses her as Candida, hermagical name. Some of these letters are profoundly moving and beautiful expressionsof love, and it’s surprising Carter made no use of them at all to cast light on theirrelationship, instead giving weight on p 171 to an unnamed fbi informant’s observation:“Subject seems very much in love with his wife but she is not at all affectionate and doesnot appear to return his affection. [2 lines censored by fbi] She is the dominatingpersonality of the two and controls the activities and thinking of subject to a veryconsiderable degree.” (Carter’s use of the letters to Cameron is restricted to twounattributed quotations on pages 60 and 108, and one cited on p 194, solely to illustratematters other than their relationship. On p 169 he mistakenly attributes a quotationfrom Parsons’ letter to Cameron of Jan 25, 1950, as coming from a letter from Parsonsto Germer of January 1951.)In a very interesting letter to Karl Germer of June 19, 1949, something emerges thatis not mentioned by Carter, Jack’s use of prostitutes for sex magick during his separationfrom Marjorie Cameron:For the time being my magical partners consist of those that can be purchased or otherwiseeasily picked up and disposed of. I have no further time for serious involvement withanyone who is not in accord with my Will. I charge you as a brother to regard this entirecommunication as strictly confidential, and preferably to destroy this letter. I do notwant anyone besides yourself to know the details of my present condition or recenthistory—my time is not yet. I have written you because I sensed your kindly interest asa brother—because you first initiated me into the most holy and glorious sanctuary ofTrue Magick—so that you might know the reasons for my present state and plans. Mybest wishes for your success, and (what is the same thing) for the accomplishment of theholy Law of Thelema, to which we are both dedicated. Love is the law, love under will.Fraternally, 210.“210” is the gematrical summation of “Io Pan”, relating to Parsons’ magical name andmotto. This letter might in addition be seen to cast doubt on Carter’s bald statementthat Parsons “hated” Germer (p 174), for which no evidence is offered. It is also in thissame letter that Parsons said he had been working as a filling station attendant, anassertion unsourced in Sex and Rockets that Shedona Chevalier desired to know theorigin of in her correspondence with Adam Parfrey.It is still puzzling why Cameron did not appear to fit the bill as the expected Babalon.Parsons writes to Cameron on October 5, 1949: “I know that Babalon is incarnate upon"},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"176earth at this moment, although I do not know where or as whom. I believe that She willmanifest in Her proper time, and that thereafter the rest of the prophecy will naturallyfollow.” He was still educating her, and the poignancy of it all emerges when one knowsthat Cameron would later, years after his death, come to believe herself to be the avatarJack awaited. Had he just set his heart on a particular scenario unfolding and he couldnot countenance, or rather recognise, the fulfilment of his desire in another and muchcloser form? Or did he secretly know Cameron was his avatar, but had to wait for her tofind out for herself ? Carter on p 135 claims Cameron said Jack had been warned in thedesert not to tell her she was Babalon and also that she saw a silver cigar-shaped ufoand she felt this was the sign and told Jack about it. No source is given. This assertionis hard to fit together, Jack is not able to tell her she is Babalon while at the same timeshe supposedly sees a ufo and presents the sighting to him as the sign expecting to beconfirmed as his avatar, which becomes even more confusing when Carter says that itwasn’t until nine years after his death that she claimed to be Babalon (p 153). ( JackParsons is also said to have been up in a plane with Kenneth Arnold, the pilot whocoined the term “flying saucer” to describe the silver disks he saw in 1947.)Despite reading The Book of Babalon many times and seeking the answer again in Sexand Rockets, I don’t feel I am really any closer to understanding exactly what Jack Parsons’magical objective was, beyond some vague wish to fulfil an equally vague prophecy inCrowley’s Book of the Law, a prospect which Crowley himself appears dismissive of, ifthat is indeed what he suspected was happening because even he seemed confused by it.Liber AL vel Legis contains a pseudo-Apocalyptic prophesy suggesting that a chosenpriest—and Crowley was “not so chosen”—would come later and reveal great mysteriesand his woman would be called the Scarlet Woman, this theme is broadly traceablethrough Chapter I, verses 15, 17, 54–57, Chapter II, verse 76, and Chapter III, verses34, 45–47. It is conceivable that Parsons believed he was the chosen one, particularlygiven that like most of the chosen ones to date he proclaimed Liber 49 to be the fourthchapter of The Book of the Law, or, rather, Babalon did through him in verse 2. Not everyThelemite regards this as heresy, Kenneth Grant says on p 17 of Beyond the MauveZone that “it is highly probable that the Book of Babalon manifested as the final chapterof AL.” Jane Wolfe, who had been with Crowley at the Abbey of Thelema in Cefalu,certainly saw in Parsons a fulfilment of Liber AL when she wrote her first impression ofhim in her magical journal in December 1940 after he joined the Agapé Lodge: “I takeJack Parsons to be the child who ‘shall behold them all’ (the mysteries hidden therein.AL I, 54–55).”Jack’s clearest statement concerning his magical objective I feel is contained in theintroduction to The Book of Babalon. After explaining that we are in an impasse of the"},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"177Age of Horus, and that domination by this force leads to war and catastrophe, which heputs down to our lack of understanding of our own natures and “the hidden lusts, fears,and hatreds resulting from the warping of the love urge”, he goes on to encapsulate aclear aim that was perhaps lost in the later psychosis of believing himself to be theAntichrist:This impasse is broken by the incarnation of another sort of force, called babalon. Thenature of this force relates to love, understanding, and Dionysian freedom, and is thenecessary counterbalance or correspondence to the manifestation of Horus.It is indicated that this force is actually incarnate in some living woman, as the resultof the described magical operation. A more basic matter, however, is the indication thatthis force is incarnate in all men and women, and needs only to be invoked to free thespirit from the debris of the old aeon, and to direct the blind force of Horus intoconstructive channels of understanding and love. The methods of this invocation aredescribed in the text.So, while he certainly did expect a living woman, singular, to fulfil his plan, he wentmuch further than even most today by recognising also that this force—Babalon—isincarnate in all men as well as all women. We cannot escape, however, the primaryconclusion that he did expect a living avatar of Babalon to result as a consequence of hismagical operation. Why this should be important is never addressed. To my mind ittypifies the very old aeon thinking that he wished to transcend, to load all responsibilityfor transforming the world upon the shoulders of a lone female, in much the same wayas thinking of Crowley as “The Beast 666” is the old aeon thinking that the 156 currentis leaving in its wake. We’ve done all that stuff before, the Saviour trip, it’s boring. Just asJesus Christ had the delusion that he was the Messiah—as was pointed out to him sowell by Satan in Scorsese’s 1988 film The Last Temptation of Christ and in NikosKazantzakis’s 1955 novel (which is used as a fresh parable in some seminaries)—JackParsons seems to have sank back into the old aeon he had initially seen through. I’mnot saying he wasn’t the Antichrist, by the way, or Crowley not the Beast, or evenChrist not the Messiah, simply that this is all such identifications amount to. I’m withSatan on that one.It is surprising that after all this time the hushed whispers and half light of old aeonthinking still remain, after all “The Law” was both “Written and Concealed” andanything not obvious is timorously suspected to be a deep occult secret (as opposed tomere rubbish) and people even today don’t dare to speak of it, lest their lack of initiationbe laid bare for all to see. This is the folly of the occult and occultists. People change,had Parsons lived what might he have made of his Babalon Working in a decade, two"},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"178decades. After his death Marjorie Cameron came to regard herself in some sense as theavatar Jack had wished to produce and got into her own trip. I noticed in a letter Parsonswrote to her on February 6, 1950, he mentions the book by Joseph Campbell The Herowith a Thousand Faces, and he says he’ll get her a copy of Crowley’s Book of Lies. He’spointing her in directions, exciting her in things that he’s excited by. Shortly after readingthis letter I came across a letter from Joseph Campbell to Cameron, dated November14, 1965. Fifteen years after Jackturned her attention to Campbell’swork Cameron sent a set of slides ofher paintings to him, and he wasdelighted by her work. And I got asense of the cyclic working out ofdifferent fates, just a glimpse but ofsomething much deeper than thebare facts of a person’s life dredgedup from fbi files, newspaper reports,employment records, and suchlike. Itis interesting to ponder whether inlater years Marjorie Cameron becamethe Babalon that Jack would haverecognised. Had he lived maybe hewould have seen his crude 1946objective distilled by time into some-thing of tangibly rich essence andunder his nose all the time. There isa painting of Cameron’s called “FossilAngel” that is very beautiful (shownhere). It made me think when I sawit, who is to say Parsons, had he lived,may not have one day seen in a painting by Cameron “the sign delivered by Our LadyBabalon Incarnate”. The Book of Babalon was intended to be a book of guidance for thisIncarnate Babalon—recounting her magical birth you might say—as indeed this bookbecame for Cameron in later years after his death. There is the sense here of a deepermore real story, one that John Carter doesn’t come close to telling, but nonetheless Sexand Rockets is still a valuable book so long as readers are aware that it contains someshoddy workmanship in the biographer’s art and are prepared to go back to the originalsources for themselves."},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"179Chevalier, Parfrey, & the “home movies” rumourOn the web, one of the best archives of Jack Parsons’ writings is Shedona Chevalier’sbabalon.net. Chevalier, of the Caliphate oto “Living Flame” camp (founded in 1997 inmemory of Jack Parsons, although “living flame” is actually L Ron Hubbard’s phrase),appears to describe herself as an “Incarnate Avatar In Your Midst” but has lately clarifiedwhat she means by adding a codicil to her website, presumably to allay any excitementthat she is actually Parsons’ hoped-for Moonchild, explaining that we should think ofthe word “avatar” not in the true sense of the word as an incarnation of a deity butsimply as we would if we used the word in cyberspace. Babalon.net is an excellent websiteand Shedona’s obvious love for Jack is touching. She says she’s writing her own book onParsons, more inclined towards the magical aspects. Shedona engaged Sex and Rocketspublisher Adam Parfrey in a lengthy correspondence on his inclusion of a paragraph onp 183 stating that after the explosion home movies were found in a trailer in a boxdecorated with snakes and dragons in which Jack was filmed having sex with his motherand the family dog.Shedona took exception to the inclusion of what she saw as mere hearsay withoutany evidence. Although it is true that Jack never wrote anything about sex with dogs hedid write concerning himself in his Analysis by a Master of the Temple: “The invocationof Babalon served to exteriorize the Oedipus complex.” It is anyone’s guess what hemay have meant by that, and he did also confess to finding the vaguely incestuous andadulterous nature of having sex with his wife’s 18-year-old sister Betty (Sara Northrup),after his wife ran off with one of his friends from the oto and before Marjorie Cameroncame on the scene, a bit of a turn-on. Here I paraphrase, he actually phrases it thus,addressing himself: “the act of adultery tinged with incest served as your magicalconfirmation in the Law of Thelema”, by which I presume he interprets “Do what thouwilt” essentially as an overcoming of taboo, interestingly enough. Jack does also say,however, that Betty tore him away from “the now unneeded Oedipus complex”. Thereseems to be a lot being alluded to here.The home movies rumour must have been music to Adam Parfrey’s ears. After beingan underground writer for a while—and his Fucking Andrea Dworkin in issue 4 of RAPEmagazine is quite funny—Parfrey made his name with the book he edited and publishedApocalypse Culture (1987), which Hakim Bey described as “art-creep death nerdism &Nazi shit-eating” in a letter to me in KAOS 13. Hakim’s work was included in the bookbut when he saw the finished product he disassociated himself from it on a point ofprinciple, saying:"},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"180People must be made to realise that this is not a two-sided fight, Prudes vs Cool Guys, orLeftists vs Daring Intellectuals Dabbling In The Fascist Camp.

Apocalypse Culture II came out in 2000, despite Parfrey’s fear that theInternet had overtaken him in the grossness stakes since the first volume. Parfrey catersmostly for the type of people who collect crime-scene photos and some of the choicerforensic science manuals and whose idea of self-discovery is a session of tentativecoprophilia or sexual congress with a vacuum cleaner. Parfrey may complain about notbeing taken seriously by the mainstream and believe himself to be on a blacklist in thatnot one of Feral House’s books has ever been reviewed in the New York Times despitehaving over 50 books out and the Ed Wood film to its credit, but the plain truth is thateven in the underground publishing scene he has always been at the shallow surfaceglamour end. Parfrey is personally interested in the occult, but only at the glitzy level.Before Sex and Rockets his main contribution to occult publishing was to ensure that allof Anton LaVey’s works remained in print. LaVey was a friend of Parfrey’s and ApocalypseCulture II contains a selection of pathetic letters people wrote to the pop Satanist. StephenLemons’ interview with Parfrey on salon.com contains this amusing thumbnail sketch:Sept 20, 2000 | LOS ANGELES—Plump, suave and swathed in black, Adam Parfreystands before me flipping through a gruesome stack of color photos depicting headlesstorsos, severed limbs and various bodies sliced and diced like mincemeat. Could be aJeffrey Dahmer wet dream or the Hannibal Lecter cookbook—take your pick. Suddenly,a small frown appears on Parfrey’s face.“I don’t like the way this red looks here,” he tuts. “Oh, here’s an article we translatedfrom Spanish titled ‘Hacking Mom.’ Seems the man attacked his mom with a machete.Macheteo a su madre.”Only Adam Parfrey could do a coffee-table book on hideous deaths in popular Mexicanculture.One thing that emerges from the Parfrey/Chevalier correspondence is that AdamParfrey says he personally heard the home movies rumour from Harold Chambers,who knew Jack Parsons and a couple of the investigators at the time. In other words,Carter’s source was Parfrey, and yet this is something that emerges solely in the"},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"181correspondence with Shedona Chevalier, in the book itself this snippet of informationis accorded more or less the same weight as all the rest of the poorly sourced material.On the same page (183), Harold Chambers is also reported as saying that he had heardthat a syringe containing a morphine-like substance was found in the blast debris, andthat one investigator at the time believed Parsons’ drug use contributed to hismishandling of explosives. No evidence is put forward to substantiate that Parsons wasaddicted to heroin, the clear implication. Was Adam Parfrey also the source for thispiece of information? Surprisingly, Shedona Chevalier didn’t bring this item up withhim. One statement in Sex and Rockets that interests me is that Marjorie Cameron issupposed to have had an (illegal) abortion to which Jack consented after becomingpregnant during the Babalon Working (p 151), but knowing now that Parfrey was thesource for the home movies rumour I wonder what else he may have been the sourcefor. I’d like to know where Cameron mentioned this abortion, what exactly she said,when she said it, and to who she said it and why—pretty standard questions that ensurejournalistic integrity. And in this, although it may seem like a lot of correspondence ona single paragraph, Shedona has actually highlighted a genuine concern about the validityof some of the information in the book. Let it be said, there is plenty of information inSex and Rockets that is quite correct, and I know because I have personally checked agreat deal of it, but unless readers have themselves studied the sources then how arethey to weigh what they read when stupid errors have been detected and the citation isatrocious? It’s a pity this so undermines Carter’s actual work of research.Some may wonder why mention was made in the book so boldly of the fact that“John Carter” is a pseudonym, on the dustjacket: “Author John Carter is the pseudonymof an individual who wishes to remain unknown.” The Feral House press release at thetime said it was because Mr Carter didn’t wish to jeopardize his job by letting hisemployers know of his interest in the occult, but this doesn’t quite explain why they feltit necessary to mention that John Carter was a pseudonym at all. The reason is thatanother hardly-known book appeared before Sex and Rockets that was obviously itsprecursor that was attributed to a different author. Jack Parsons and the Fall of Babalonby Paul Rydeen was published in 1995 by Crash Collusion Publishing, Berkeley ca, an80 page centre-stapled book that does not mention the home movies rumour, thehypodermic syringe, or Cameron’s abortion. Sex and Rockets is a greatly expanded versionof this earlier book.The correspondence between Chevalier and Parfrey can be found on babalon.net,along with a collection of Jack Parsons’ writings (including his letters to Cameron) andarticles about him, and reviews of Babalon-associated books and movies.

The evidence was foundinsufficient to bring him to trial for espionage, but it was regarded that his integrity wasno longer sufficient to allow him access to Top Secret materials and his security clearancewas withdrawn on January 7, 1952. The file also deals with the earlier temporary loss ofhis clearance in 1948.

From some of his experiences I deduce thathe is in direct contact with some higher intelligence, possibly his Guardian Angel ...

For the present the director seems satisfied with showing the film exclusivelyat an independent cinema in Clearwater, Florida, the Mecca for Scientologists. Thewriter and director, Peter Alexander, was a Scientologist for 20 years before leaving in1997 and claims to have personally poured over $1-million into the Church over theyears before realising it was a sophisticated fraud.Although the film is targeted at Scientology, an interesting side-issue is whether thefilm will incline people to wonder about the truth behind Zack’s black magick sect.A more serious film about Jack Parsons is planned.

The intricacy of the style of fine-line hatching and alsothe intensity of the colour, particularly the red of the dragon in otherwise monochromeimages, comes out more than it does in the low resolution scans on the website. ProfSteczynski, of Boston College, has for the past twenty years made pen and ink drawingsand painted liturgical hangings. He states that his work comes out of the modernistrejection of explicit religious imagery that has occurred since the 1950s, that has, as heputs it, “begun to give way to a post-modernist absorption of ethnic traditions stronglyimbued with religious themes”. His choice to focus on the Apocalypse of St John duringhis sabbatical leave in 1997–1998 was inspired by the forthcoming millennium, giventhat many people associate “millennium” with the Apocalypse. He expands on this:There was a more pressing impetus, however. The extreme right might try to find waysto manipulate the appeal that the Apocalypse already has for Christians of a morefundamentalist orientation to promote its own political agendas for the millennium. Iwanted my Apocalypse to remain true to John’s vision, manifesting its full intensity.

Alexander was born at thebeginning of the 2nd century ad, in Abonoteichus, on the southern coast of the BlackSea (now Inebolu, in Turkey). By his teenage years, Alexander had developed into astrikingly beautiful young man, and, not coincidentally, a rent-boy. In this capacity heswiftly attracted the attention of a local quack-doctor and hermetic huckster with anice line in philtres and incantations who claimed to be a student of Apollonius ofTyana but, like everyone else in this history, was probably lying. Living with this BlackSea Barnum over the next few years, Alexander underwent a crash course in 2nd centurychicanery, so that upon the death of his mentor (and the passing of both his boyishcharms and his hustler career) the young man had a ready-made new line of business tomove into."},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"188Around this time, by now in his early 20s, Alexander fell in with a reputedlyabominable Byzantine choral lyricist named Cocconas, which means “nut”. Like a lateRoman Hope and Crosby in The Road to Ephesus, this pair travelled the region for aconsiderable period purveying quackery and sorcery and, as Lucian remarks, “trimmingthe fatheads”. (“Trim the fatheads” has, of course, become one of the principalcommandments and guiding aphorisms of the present-day Moon & Serpent movement.As a result of following this simple and lucid instruction, we’re raking it in.

After a couple of decades of such activities, the duowashed up in the province of Bithynia where they were taken under the wing, if not theduvet, of “a rich Macedonian woman, past her prime but still eager to be charming”. Itmay be that she was herself charmed by the charismatic Alexander, who at this pointseemingly possessed an almost Rasputin-like sexual gravitas and allure. Tall, fair-skinnedand godlike, he had glowing eyes and what sound very much like hair-extensions; acrusty from The Village of the Damned.Lining their pockets at the woman’s expense, Alexander and Cocconas accompaniedtheir patroness upon her return trip home to Pella, ancient capital of Macedonia. Perhapsshe’d tired of them, or perhaps, having maxed out her credit-cards, they’d tired of her.Whatever the event, a new scam was required.As it happened, Pella, in this period, was pretty much Snake City. Around 500 yearsbefore, our Alexander’s psychopathic and more-famous namesake had been born there,reputedly the offspring of his mom, Olympias, and either Zeus in the form of a snake,or a snake with a smooth line in date-rape patter. Subsequently, these ophidians becamethe pet of choice in Pella. Tame and sweet, they played with children, slept with womenand, allegedly, “took milk from the breast just like babies”. No pap without a python, noboob without a boa. Inspired by the compliance and manageability of these impressivereptiles, Alexander and Cocconas purchased an unusually striking specimen for a fewcoppers (probably not their own) and took it on with them to Chalcedon.In Chalcedon they forged bronze tablets which proclaimed that soon Asclepius,snake-friendly god of healing, would take up his residence in Abonoteichus. Furtivelyburied then miraculously discovered in the temple of Apollo, this early, innovative ad-campaign worked well enough to prompt the founding of a temple in Abonoteichusready for the god’s arrival and laid the groundwork for the serpent-sting to follow.Leaving Cocconas in Chalcedon to work his jingle-writer’s magic on some hot neworacles, our hero-turned-snake-smuggler took off for Abonoteichus, his squirming cargocovertly in tow. Cocconas, sadly (or conveniently), did not survive to reap the benefitsof his and Alexander’s scheme, expiring not long after from a viper bite.

During this stage of his career, our boy had cleverly rebranded himselfas direct descendant of the gods. As Alexander told it, he was son to Podaleirius, andthus the grandson of Asclepius, great-grandson of Apollo, great-great-grandson ofalmighty Zeus himself. Oh, and he was descended from Perseus on his mother’s side aswell. While all the locals must have been aware that Alexander was the offspring ofobscure and humble folk, their faith in oracles convinced them that here in their sightwas: “a scion of Perseus, dear unto Phoebus; this is divine Alexander, who shareth theblood of the Healer”. Presumably the oracle in question represented one of Cocconas’sbetter days. Certainly, along with all the frothing-at-the-mouth, this lurid genealogyhelped to establish Alexander in Abonoteichan gossip-columns and society pages as aperson to watch out for, one way or another.In the small hours of the night preceding Alexander’s master-stroke, he crept outand concealed a blown goose-egg containing a small newborn serpent in a puddle atthe temple that had been erected in the fuss that followed the “discovery” of Cocconas’stablets back in Chalcedon. It was here on the next day that he performed his finelychoreographed miracle. Naked save a loin-cloth, Alexander ran into the market-place,thrashing his lengthy locks about like a devotee of Cybele, or perhaps the drummer outof Motorhead. Working the crowd with glossolalic babble and with mentions of Apolloand Asclepius, he led them to the temple, whereupon he reached into the water andretrieved his previously planted egg, to gasps of great amazement from the multitude.Cracking it with his thumbnail he allowed the concealed snake to wind into his palm,at which the gathered throng went nuts and cheered and did a Mexican Wave, welcomingthe deity. Pleased with his work our man went home, taking his sacred maggot withhim.Alexander let the city have a day or two to simmer. From the neighbouring provincesa horde of theological away-supporters flooded into Abonoteichus, while from theprophet’s den a trickle of stage-managed leaks revealed the serpent to have grown to aprodigious size, evolved a semi-human head and mastered Greek. Finally, in darkenedchambers Alexander’s squamous god was ceremoniously revealed: its massive lengthwas coiled about its self-appointed high priest’s body as he sat upon a couch there inthe gloom, inviting the spectators to lay hands upon its coils and satisfy themselves thatit was real. The snake’s neck seemed to vanish under Alexander’s arm, where nextappeared, hung down over his shoulder, its extraordinary head. This was a masterpieceof both conception and construction.

Thecrowning glory was its hair, long golden tresses spilling down, conveniently maskingthe ambiguous point at which this ersatz cranium joined with the real snake, drowsinghead tucked under Alexander’s arm. The dim light in the room no doubt greatly improvedthis curious illusion, possibly abetted by whatever other ritualistic showman’s tricks theseasoned conman had decided to employ in order to enhance the sheer disorientingweirdness of the atmosphere.The audience, having run their fingertips across the warm dry scales and watchedthe coiled length shift and move, were by this time assured of the god’s authenticity.The prophet Alexander was now, as they say, ready to rock.

Alexanderhad established himself with one swift, ingenious sleight-of-hand as the Grand Poobahof a cult that would propel him into a position of enormous influence extending fromthe Black Sea to the Adriatic, and which would survive him by a century.So, after that it was down to business, with Alexander’s Rag-time Oracle and Patent-Medicine Show. No, he wasn’t selling Snake-oil (that would have been uncouth);Alexander’s cure-all was an ointment of bear’s grease. He swore by it. So do we (in fact,we’re often heard to exclaim: “Oh, bear’s grease!”). And as for the oracles ...Well, working on the notion that things must be better the more they cost, Alexander(or Al, as we like to think of him, especially when we think of other lying books thathave the same word in their titles) naturally charged four times as much as any otheroracle centre in the vicinity. And the fatheads bought it, big-time. Some oracles weregiven vocally, by Glycon himself; others were given overnight, after Al had had thechance to “steam open the envelopes” containing the questions; some were given to noone in particular, answering questions that had never been asked (always a marvelloustrick if you can get away with it). And some were in “Scythian”. Now, Alexander couldn’tspeak Scythian any more than we can, but that was okay.

If his religious fervourcould be roused by any greasy rock then we can but imagine what he’d make of a gianttalking human-headed snake with hair.We can also imagine just what Alexander made of our Rutilianus. No doubt drachma-signs were flashing in his eyes when first the full potential of Rutilianus’s extraordinarygullibility occurred to him. “Hey, if you like my human-headed snake, I’ve got thisbridge you might be interested in.” The bridge in question led from earth to heaven inthe person of an alleged daughter sired by Alexander on the Moon-goddess Selene(who’d apparently been overcome with lust for Alexander while he slept one night).Where this “daughter” may have been produced from, we can only speculate. It is,however, a safe bet that no such speculations long absorbed Rutilianus. As a creduloussexagenarian he was clearly tickled pink by both his young wife and the prospect of agoddess as his mother-in-law. Why, he’d practically be one of the celestial family, almosta god himself. The greasy rocks would come and worship him instead.Rutilianus was, before long, made the governor of Asia. Being Alexander’s son-in-law, Rutilianus could extend the influence of Alexander’s cult throughout the empire,introducing Glycon into high society. Meanwhile, back home in Abonoteichus, a full-blown Moon-and-Serpent ceremonial mystery theatre was about to make its debut.Lucian describes it as a three-day ceremony with priestly offices and torchlight rallies,annually held, in perpetuity. The first day was a recap (“Previously, on Moon & Serpent ...”),running through the whole soap-opera genealogy from Zeus down to Asclepius, passingthrough Leto and Apollo and Coronis, for the benefit of viewers who tuned in late. Thesecond day presented a retelling of the origins of Glycon (a diminutive of glycus, meaning“sweet”, thus “Sweety”), where the god presumably starred as himself. (“I just got infrom Olympus. Boy, is my belly sore. No but seriously. Anybody in from Ephesus ...?”)The final day commenced with Alexander tastefully presenting a depiction of hismother being shagged by Podaleirius, then built up to a rousing climax when the audiencewas treated to a tableau which showed Alexander and Selene engaged in conceiving thewife of Rutilianus: “the torch-bearer and hierophant was our Endymion, Alexander.While he lay in full view, pretending to be asleep, there came down to him from the"},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":"192roof, as if from heaven, not Selene but Rutilia, a very pretty woman, married to one ofthe emperor’s stewards. She was genuinely in love with Alexander and he with her; andbefore the eyes of her worthless husband there were kisses and embraces in public. Ifthe torches had not been numerous, perhaps the thing would have been carried evenfurther.”This enthralling blend of mystery religion and Raymond Revue-Bar did marvellouslywell for a contemporary cult. Marcus Aurelius himself sought out the snake-god’sprophecy concerning his then-current war in Germany against the Marcomanni andthe Quadi. While Alexander drank a glass of water, Glycon recited the alphabet andthen advised the emperor to dump two live lions and a load of perfume in the Danube,so that a victory would be secured. Yeah, right. When 20,000 Romans died as a result ofthis disastrous advice, our boy Al cited the Delphic Defence, claiming a victory hadbeen secured by somebody.Despite a prophecy that he’d die struck by lightning at age one hundred and fifty,Alexander was brown bread before his seventieth birthday. Nasty business. One legmortified, groin full of maggots. Al had always claimed to have a gold thigh likePythagoras, so maybe it was metal fatigue. His cult, however, did survive for roughlyone hundred and fifty years before being struck by the lightning of the Christian anti-Pagan pogroms during the 4th century. C’est la vie. Che sera sera. Hasta la vista.Time passed.The current order of Moon and Serpent Grand Egyptian Theatre of Marvels wasinaugurated following a chance event in early 1994. While browsing at a FarringdonRoad bookstall, folded in a Look-In annual from the early 1970s, we found a letter fromFrau Anna Sprengel. Honestly, I ask you, what are the chances of that? In the letter,Annie (as she insists we call her) states that all her earlier letters were, as she puts it,“eine vind-up. Who says ve Germans haf no sense of humour?” Revealing that the onetrue mystic order of the ages is in fact the aforementioned Moon and Serpent GrandEgyptian Theatre of Marvels, she then authorised us to found lodges throughout thewestern world, to dress up in fancy frocks like girls, and to take everybody’s money. Weadmit that various other occult orders and authorities have cast aspersions on theauthenticity of our Frau Sprengel letter, but fuck ’em.As for the teachings of our order, they are simple and direct:1. Fuck ’em.2. Trim the fatheads."},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":"1933. We understand the Moon to be Selene, and to be the cabalistic Yesod, and thus theentirety of dream, romance and the human imagination.4.

Given that Lucian is a notorious liar and author ofA True Story, which is full of egregious falsehoods, it is almost certain that Alexanderwas made up by Lucian. Having confessed ourselves to dishonesty in our openingparagraphs, we may as well confess that we made up Lucian. You, Joel, are widelyrecognised as the least reliable occult source since Sooty, and your readers will surely bynow have realised that you yourself are making us up. I mean, what are the chances ofyou knowing two high-powered comic-book professionals like us? As if. Your readersmay next realise, upon fruitlessly scanning the birth records for anyone who has everhad “Biro Company” for a surname, that you are entirely an invention of theirs, a hate-figure with which they externalise their own self-loathing. It will take your readershiponly one small step to comprehend that they, as creations of the dna, have been madeup by Glycon, who, historically, speak with forked tongue.As to your enquiry with regard to our initiation rituals and grades, there are noinitiation rituals, or if there are they are so impossibly demanding that no one has evercompleted them, or would wish to. We’d certainly never put ourselves through anythinglike that, and thus do not actually belong to the Order, which isn’t taking on new membersanyway. Conspiratorial affiliations with other secret societies include the Process Churchof the Final Judgement, and the I-Spy Club (whose Chief I-Spy, presiding over long"},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":"194car-journeys, is one of our secret chiefs. “It does not matter if Chief I-Spy exists, simplythat the universe behaves as if Chief I-Spy exists.”).As for grades, we follow the example of Pete Carroll’s Illuminates of Thanateros byeschewing pretentious grades and self-aggrandizing titles, nobly demonstrating thatdespite all appearances to the contrary, we are in fact ordinary common-as-muck peoplelike you and everybody else.Love and Judge Dredd are the law, Love and Judge Dredd under will.Yours cordially,Alan MooreExquisite Basilisk of the Pittering Mansions, Lord High Skeletor, Made Manand Capo (33rd Degree Sicilian Rite) (and could I make clear for the record that the33rd Degree Sicilian Rite HAS NOTHING WHATSOEVER TO DO WITHHOMOSEXUALITY), Arkela and senior wand-monitor.Steve MooreGrandiloquent Tusker, Euphonious Squid of the Humming Enchymoma,Commissioner of Martian Affairs, Madame Guillotine and junior hornswoggler."},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":"195Zobop passportsby Joel BirocoI saw a photograph of a zobop passport in Voodoo: Truth and Fantasy by Laënnec Hubon(London: Thames and Hudson, 1995, p 63). A zobop is a sorcerer belonging to a secretsociety in Haiti. Apparently these passport documents allowed the bearer to roam freelyby day and by night without being molested. The photograph of the zobop passportinspired me to create a series of zobop passports in watercolour and Indian ink, a coupleof which are shown here in KAOS (pages 66 and 78).But the question arose in my mind as to who might be checking these passportdocuments, so I did a little research and came across a fascinating article from theSummer 1979 issue of Magonia (http://www.magonia.demon.co.uk/arc/70/haiti.html).In “An abduction syndrome in Haitian folklore”, Peter Rogerson, seeking parallelsbetween ufo abduction stories and folkloric abduction stories, draws attention to apassage in Alfred Metraux’s 1959 book Voodoo in Haiti concerning a panic that grippedHaitian peasants, probably in the 1940s, about a motor car that was said to abductpeople. Rogerson notes:In the capital Port-au-Prince the car was known as the auto-tigre (tiger-car); in Marbial,where Metraux conducted his fieldwork, it was the motor-zobop, a vehicle supposedlydriven by the zobop, members of a secret society of sorcerers having many of thecharacteristics of traditional witches. This car had bluish beams for its headlights.Metraux spoke to several people who claimed to have been abducted by the motor-zobop who said they had managed to escape because they were protected by voodoo.Rogerson doesn’t mention zobop passports, but clearly such an item would have beenuseful if you came across the motor-zobop late one night. Wade Davis in The Serpentand the Rainbow suggests the zobop and other secret societies were “a quasi-politicalarm of the vodoun society” (New York: Simon & Schuster, 1985, p 211–212). ManuelCarballal says: “The Zobop terrorized the population by kidnapping in the dark ofnight anyone considered a traitor to the community in order to ‘bring them to justice’"},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"196in a cruel fashion.” On the original zobop passports the writing would usually be inFrench, and an official-looking sticker such as a stamp-duty sticker or perhaps even theseal from a cigarbox or something similar would be stuck on the passport together witha stamped number. In the only example of a zobop passport I have seen the mainillustration is a naïve drawing of a person. On my own zobop passports the writing is“spirit writing” done in a trance state, inspired by the tradition of “protective spiritwriting” that occurs in folk cultures of the American south, originating from WestAfrica, as exemplified by the paintings of the illiterate artist J B Murry. While suchspirit writing is simply scribble, and not language, it is done for magical protectiveeffect and so intention informs the spontaneous writing. And J B Murry did claim to beable to read his spirit writing through a distorting bottle of holy water.
