[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"A DICTIONARY OF “THE FORGOTTEN ONES\" Rumour has it that the Forgotten Ones, the Faceless Ones ah la the Titans, breached human consciousness in the twentieth century. Various reasons could get given for this which would include the splitting of the atom, the development of nuclear science, our own evolutionary development or even the peculiarities of a double aeonic current (Horus/Maat) that some practitioners of magic might consider in operation. These primal forces variously named The Forgotten Ones, the Elder Gods, the Great Old Ones, or the Ancient Ones, once got defined by the artist-magician Allen Holub as: \"...The raw unnamed energies existing since the icy cold of the fabric of space emerged from nought. They pre-date the coming of space itself, and of time, from the aethers, although it can be said that they represent the process of formation itself...\" “Outside the Circles of Time” K. Grant. In an unpublished document entitled \"The Keys of Aaton\" a speaker notes the following: \"...Mark well what I have said, for comes a day When dark things held in harness are revealed By Man's own curiosity, and blood Is multiplied with new and deadly fears. The Faceless Ones unlocked are not put out With weaponry or words that of a time Created access, yet we thread a door Beneath the nightmare with the Spinners' Line...\" The names of the Ancient Ones and the Elder Gods, the primal forces, have come from a variety of sources: notably from Chaldean, Sumerian, Assyrian, African and Egyptian, and from the realms of dream and vision and imagination. In the twentieth century, the fantasy writer H. P. Lovecraft provided material that eventually got researched by The Order of the Seven Rays in Haiti. Other writers have included Robert E. Howard, Clark Ashton Smith, August Derleth and Robert Bloch. This document makes the attempt to list some of the names and concepts associated with these most ancient primal forces albeit that this seems only the tip of a cosmic iceberg reaching through infinities. No differentiation gets made between the Elder Gods and the Ancient Ones, or the Great Old Ones, no bias towards better or worse. Perhaps these forces should ultimately get seen as beyond human comprehension because we have limits and they do not. This dictionary also includes some created “demonic” forms associated with these Forgotten Ones, as well as terms that should provide insights into this realm of chaos.
