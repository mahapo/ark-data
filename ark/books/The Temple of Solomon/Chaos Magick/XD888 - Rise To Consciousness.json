Through the eons the arduous struggle for development of consciousness may well be considered the highest cultural achievement, as well as the most commendable human accomplishment and utmost ascent. In order to perceive this truth, one must first realize that all mankind has to some degree fallen, or has been separated from Absolute Consciousness. Throughout the ages, a myriad of thinking minds have given birth to, developed, and propagandized systems by which man may best achieve or regain the ascent to higher consciousness, or find the Absolute Truth. Although many religious systems have attempted to show man \"The Way\", this path is best found through the fervent and directed will of the individual. When one becomes so disenchanted with the illusions of the world, or for some other reason it becomes necessary to devote particular attention to the personal psyche, they turn inward in great despair and the soul cries in despondent agony, \"Who am I? What am I? Where did I come from?\". It is at that moment when the personal rise to consciousness has been acknowledged and thereby fertilized.Just what is Consciousness? It can be duly defined as the ultimate, final Reality, or Absolute Truth. In and of itSelf, it performs no function, but is a presence - everywhere. It does not change or vary and while there are many degrees of being conscious, there are no levels or division of it. It is the beginning without end and just IS. Consciousness is described in many ways, but by far the most adequately appropriate is through the analogy of light. It is through light that mankind perceives both inner and outer sight. This light must be kindled in its true dwelling place - the SELF. The noted Swiss psychologist, Dr. C.G. Jung says that \"the beginning, where everything is still one, and which therefore appears as the highest goal, lies at the bottom of the sea, in the darkness of the unconscious\". Darkness gives birth to light. Human nature and consciousness are best expressed in terms of light. Thus, the darkness (unconsciousness) gives birth to the light (consciousness). The despondent soul, upon realizing that it does not walk in harmony with the dualistic, questioning nature of itSELF, blatantly recognizes the challenges of this world of endless contrast. file:///D|/Occultism,%20Hermetics,%20Alchemy...%20Consciousness%20Part%201%20The%20Dove.htm (1 of 12) [7/25/03 10:49:59 PM]"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Rise to Consciousness Part 1 The DoveThe soul then desperately seeks knowledge. It is through this knowledge that a person endeavors to find and unify truth. This quest bludgeons one down paths of trial and error until there is at long last nowhere to turn and no knowledge nor earthly formula is sustaining. Out of this darkness a small flicker begins to grow. Through the light of the intellect, a person forsakes all that they are and all that they know to learn that they know nothing about who they really are or from whence they came. At this ground zero point, the person is open to a new attitude, according to Jung, that accepts the \"irrational and incomprehensible simply because it is happening.\" At this point, the shift in consciousness is fertilized, and the flame of the soul is sparked to a higher level. The sleeping dragon awakens.Humans are many faced, multidimensional beings whose outer flesh houses the inner substance. In the world of physics this would best be explained as the vacuum contained within matter. The flesh, in dense frequency tends to confine and trap the inner body until it is realized that there is a dualistic contrast - a struggle occurring between the inner and outer nature. The inner bodies are the electrical and magnetic matter (the light body) connecting the flesh body with the breathform. These inner bodies transfer impressions from the flesh body to the breathform via the nerves. When one is able to reconcile and balance these inner bodies with the outer, they have advanced toward understanding their true nature. The Hui Ming Ching states:If thou wouldst complete the diamond body with no outflowing, Diligently heat the roots of consciousness and life. Kindle light in the blessed country ever close at hand, And there hidden, let thy true self always dwell.In other words, the human form consists of the flesh and the soul and upon their alchemical reunion, the wholeness of SELF is found. The infamous physician and alchemical philosopher, Philippus Aureolus Threophrastus Bombastus von Hohenheim, known as Paracelsus, stated that man is \"one part temporal, the other part eternal, and each part takes its light from God and that there is nothing that does not have its origin in God.\" Therefore, as he plainly states in the astrum, \"in man who is made the image of God, can be found both the cause and the medicine\". Contained within human nature is both light (consciousness) and darkness (unconsciousness). In an ancient Arabic treatise attributed to Hermes, Mercurius states, \"I beget the light, but the darkness too is of my nature. Nothing better or more worthy can come to pass in the world than the union of myself with my Son.\" Mercurius exists of all conceivable opposites but is unified.According to the Hui Ching Ming, \"human nature\" (hsing) and \"consciousness\" are used interchangeably. The union of opposites on a high level of consciousness, per Dr. Jung, is not a rational thing, nor it is a matter of will, but instead a process of psychic development that expresses itSELF in symbols. Both human nature and consciousness are expressed in light symbolism.Many religious practices teach that to achieve salvation, one must overcome the deadly, sinful nature of flesh. However, consider that the fleshly body is a temple and serves as a bridge between heaven and earth. The flesh is a conduit through which the divine may experience and make itSELF manifest within the various dimensions or realms of existence. When understood in it’s natural context, the flesh can be regenerated and brought to a peak of perfection as a temple for the complete multidimensional SELF. The earthly human bears within a spiritual light being.

However, unless we are first able to balance and integrate the multidimensional bodies, we cannot hope to climb the upward spiral toward higher consciousness. At this point in time the rise to consciousness for many is coming with the speed of light and we cannot hope to assimilate it unless we have cleared the paths through the physical body in order to let it freely flow. This is the climax of the human experience. This is best exemplified by the writings of Paracelsus in his treatise on astronomy wherein he stated: \"The wise man is the man who lives by divine wisdom and is an image of Him in whose likeness he was created. The wise man rules over both bodies – the sidereal or aerial, and the elemental or material, body. Man must serve both, he must go the ways of each, in order to fulfill the law of the Lord and live in harmony with nature, and with the will of God and with the divine spirit. He must not prefer the mortal body and its reason to the eternal \"image\", nor must he reject this \"image\" for the sake of the animal body and find eternal salvation in the wisdom of the animal body... The wise man lives after the image of god and is not guided by the ways of the world. And he who imitates God will conquer the stars.\" In addition to Jung, mystics, alchemists, prophets, seers, visionaries, and many others, attest to light as being the substance and conduit of the inner worlds and the channel through which we are enabled to see the things of the soul as it shines through the dense materials of the flesh to enlighten us. The head is the seat of consciousness and a study of the energy flows in the body will reveal that the crown chakra is the focal point of one’s contact with the individual higher SELF - the gateway to one’s bridge with the divine. It is through the visions of light, dreams, opus medulla, etc. that one’s personal myth builds in a manner which is conducive to their individual rise to consciousness and they begin to come into contact with their interdimensional being. One must learn to translate their myth and not build their life around it, but instead learn what it means to their personal goal of union with the divine. The path to enlightened consciousness is difficult to define and its goal even more difficult to achieve. It is not to be mapped out and planned by the ingenuity of the human mind. To do so would forfeit the goal and bring either limited success (egomania), or immediate failure. However, it is a natural process of human spiritual evolution - which defines itSELF and occurs with or without our conscious participation. The sheer force of will properly submitted to the evolutionary process results in the desired goal being achieved with less human harshness. In a sense, what we struggle to become we are already. The human experience is described uniquely by the notion that perhaps souls are divine sparks from the one true source seeking experience in creation before the long journey home (not necessarily a place). Through the corridors of time we are multidimensional, divine beings having the human experience, not humans trying to have a multidimensional, divine experience. Humans are the bridge between heaven and earth and consciousness is the factor that links the two.file:///D|/Occultism,%20Hermetics,%20Alchemy...%20Consciousness%20Part%201%20The%20Dove.htm (3 of 12) [7/25/03 10:49:59 PM]"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Rise to Consciousness Part 1 The DoveOur universe is one of sharp contrast and duality. This very opposition can be seen as a quite necessary catalyst to higher consciousness. Scientific evidence will support that all things have positive and negative polarity and that for every action that is an equal and opposite reaction. This very contrast is what serves to teach humans a higher order through the Law of Balance - the union of opposites energized into a seemingly inert state that contains within itSELF the multifaceted energies of the quantum life force.The Law of Balance is extremely important to understanding consciousness. The grasp of this concept becomes even more critical when imparting on the journey to higher consciousness because the goal cannot be accomplished without uniting the opposites. Upon studying the living religions of the modern world, one can conclude that the greatest adepts of each religious system focused primary importance on the same major dogma - the universal law of cause and effect. This is in direct conjunction to the scientific theory of action versus reaction. This law brings balance and assists man in finding himself in the universal vast channels of contrast and duality. Mohammed stated: \"Let none of you treat his brother in a way he himself would dislike being treated.\" Jesus commanded: \"All things whatsoever ye would that men do unto you, do even unto them.\" Buddha contended: \"In dealing with others, one should do as he would have done him.\" The most important doctrine of all religions seems to be balance of cause and effect, which leads to self discovery and the eventual ascension beyond the need for balance into unity. If cause and effect cannot be balanced in the physical, third dimensional consciousness, they cannot be united as similar opposites, or balanced mirror images in the dimensions beyond time and space. Balance can be applied not only to one's religion, but to consciousness as a direct parallel. When coming to terms with the polarization of the conscious and the unconscious mind, it is of critical importance to maintain balance within daily life functions. You must be able to live successfully in the material world of limitation, as well as maintain direct contact with the archetypal dimensions. It is the balancing, assimilation, and integration of the two that thrusts one toward enlightenment and the integration of the multidimensional SELF (the embodiment of all levels including the personal angel). There are many detours along the craggy path to enlightenment with ancient evils lurking and danger beckoning the undisciplined mind. This is the human plight. Many religious systems have attempted to draw the roadmap pointing disciples toward enlightened consciousness. Systems such as Christianity, Islam, Freemasonry, Yoga, Alchemy, and a myriad of others too many to mention, as well as participation in both drugs and the occult, can lead to expanded consciousness. It would seem that the greatest dilemma lies not in whether to achieve consciousness, which again is a natural human evolutionary process, but in how best to achieve it in a conscious manner! Although a specific developmental system may bring awareness and enlightenment to an individual, possibly even claiming to be the one true source, the truth of the matter is that your soul is the true source and your path is best mapped according to your soul’s guidance, or personal gnosis.file:///D|/Occultism,%20Hermetics,%20Alchemy...%20Consciousness%20Part%201%20The%20Dove.htm (4 of 12) [7/25/03 10:49:59 PM]"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Rise to Consciousness Part 1 The DoveAttempts to achieve higher consciousness through the use of drugs and hallucinogens are mind expanding and according to the experience of some, does open inner doors. However, in order to sustain your rise to consciousness, your emotional, spiritual, and physical being must bear clear channels for the embodiment of such enlightenment. Pseudo, or shortcut attempts to reach illuminated levels through the use of hallucinogenic drugs may find the person not spiritually and physiologically grounded enough to understand and absorb all that is seen, felt, and heard in other dimensions, and leaves the inner and outer bodies teetering out of balance.Many asylums are filled with saddened souls who have channeled in various directions either with or without external agents and simply cannot find the way home. There are also many individuals who have spontaneous mystical and profound experiences and never understand why they cannot willfully go there again. The determining key is a balance of the multidimensional bodies. The balance of the multidimensional bodies is such a delicate process that there is little wonder there are so few adepts. The human experience allows us to become experts at this process. Multidimensional balance involves more than tuning up the outer body, but the inner light body must be attuned as well. As the ancient Hebrews and Egyptians well knew, we must feed both the inner and outer bodies properly, for without a strong inner light body, the physical body would soon become out of tune and perish, which occurs in old age and physical death. The more out of tune the physical body becomes, the more consciousness is reduced. All the tools necessary to nourish these bodies are available within the various dimensions. It is the task of the seeker to integrate these tools and make them work in a specific manner to their unique need. For this task there are no true external physicians; no modern doctors who can cure or build the inner light body. This task of the rise to consciousness and enlightenment requires personal commitment. Upon that commitment to SELF, it is then that all necessary sources become as tools. Unlike the medical physician who is concerned purely with matters of the flesh, the in-depth psychologist is concerned not only with substantiating the complexities of the mind, but also with psychic experience. It has been authenticated that psychic contents are experienced and that their autonomy is without question. Jung stated that \"there are fragmentary psychic systems that appear spontaneously in ecstatic states\" resulting in enlightened consciousness. Or, according to Jung, if the person is spiritually unconditioned these pressures end in mental disturbances \"fixed in delusions and hallucinations which destroy the unity of the mind\".121 So, without criticism, it would appear that the safest method of development is in keeping the channels as clear as possible and with having some sort of personal religion or belief system on which to rely, even if the beliefs change during the course of development - and change they will of their own accord. file:///D|/Occultism,%20Hermetics,%20Alchemy...%20Consciousness%20Part%201%20The%20Dove.htm (5 of 12) [7/25/03 10:49:59 PM]"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Rise to Consciousness Part 1 The DoveIt is the uncommon person who acknowledges their everyday, unconscious concern with the matter of the rise to consciousness. The Ego protects one from admitting the need for higher consciousness, and even when the need is admitted, it is not often focused on because it seems too difficult to understand. The Ego, in despair of what it does not understand, turns away and the matter is stored within the unconscious realms to later spontaneously seep its way into everyday affairs. It is the even more uncommon person who is both capable of perceiving the nature of the rise to consciousness and understanding how the rise to consciousness and enlightenment is achieved. Jung devoted many years of his life to the subject of the conscious versus the unconscious mind, which he also related to light versus darkness. IF the unconscious mind can be recognized as a factor along with consciousness, and IF we conduct our lives taking both into serious account, then the personality is no longer centered on EGO (which, according to Jung is merely the center of consciousness), but instead is balanced between the conscious and unconscious which Jung called SELF. Upon achieving the success of balancing or finding SELF, it becomes no longer necessary to actively participate in the mystique of orthodox religions and various developmental systems. The goal then transcends the normal need for balance in our polarized world of contrast and duality. It results in a personality that suffers only in the lower levels of the mind, but in its upper storeys is detached from both pain and joy. This symbolizes an attitude beyond the reach of both emotional entanglements and violent shock - a consciousness detached from the world. In Jung's opinion, \"the man who lives with his instincts can also detach from them, and in just as natural a way as he lived with them.\"121 This relates directly to how a person can live an active life in the world and still not be part of it. The human psyche possesses a common substratum transcending all differences in culture and awareness of consciousness. Jung labeled this the collective unconscious (darkness). There must be an increase in consciousness (light) in order to find true Self , which is man’s highest goal. In order to effectively nurture this increase, the will must be focused toward achieving higher consciousness. He conceived that \"the beginning where everything is still one and which therefore appears as the highest goal, lies at the bottom of the sea, in the darkness of the unconscious\"120. Thus, the darkness (unconsciousness) conceives light (consciousness). Jung said that this light (consciousness) dwells in the face, between the eyes. Dr. Jung went further to explain that the vision of light is an experience common to many mystics and one that is of the greatest significance because it proves to be something unconditioned and absolute, a combination of supreme power and profound meaning.During the course of Dr. Jung's years of analysis of a broad range of patients he became aware that when the limited conscious mind links with the vast collective unconscious of the universe the result can be quite cataclysmic, as when contrasts clash in an attempt to overpower each other. The gnostic Nag Hammadi texts quote Jesus as having said, \"If you bringforth what it within you, what it within you will save you.file:///D|/Occultism,%20Hermetics,%20Alchemy...%20Consciousness%20Part%201%20The%20Dove.htm (6 of 12) [7/25/03 10:49:59 PM]"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Rise to Consciousness Part 1 The Dove If you do not bring forth what it within you, what is within you will destroy you.\" This truth can be related to the duality of the conscious and unconscious mind and the efforts of one to control the other. As Jesus so adeptly stated, the unconscious mind must come forth and find its place alongside the conscious mind in order to balance the soul and bring it forth from the darkness.The universal Law of Balance effects that for every good there is a similar evil, or for every measure of light there is an equal and opposing measure of darkness. In this dimension this contrast is necessary to maintain structure and order from chaos. Achieving the fine balance between the contrasting polarities, a place of total light, should be the immediate goal of the spiritually ascetic. In other words, this goal should be identifying the SELF that is focused on the center of light (consciousness) and darkness (unconsciousness). At mankind's present stage of spiritual evolution as a whole, it has not been possible for everyone to develop fully into the light of consciousness, as did Jesus Christ, nor should one develop fully into the darkness of the unconscious realm as this creates hazards for the soul. A person should balance creating inertia between the two and await the time that the need for balance will be transcended and the soul can ascend the higher dimensions of pure consciousness. There are no adequate \"How To\" books, or hands-on guidance systems (including religions and philosophical theory) that contain fool proof methods on developing higher awareness of consciousness. But, it can be safely stated that a person’s goals and motives must remain pure during this natural developmental process or else any achievement can result in egomania as epitomized in the quasi-spiritual Third Reich of Adolf Hitler and others throughout mankind’s long universal history. Jung's statements on consciousness teach that the light of divinity is invisible within the soul and to seek it, one must do so with a divine purpose, or else the knowledge achieved can create egomania (perhaps even an antichrist?). Jung further states that to serve a mania is detestable and undignified, but to serve a god is full of meaning and promise because it is an act of submission to a higher, invisible, and spiritual force. He concludes that when a god is not acknowledged, egomania develops and out of this mania comes sickness. But, according to Jung, \"the person who has understood what is meant by psychic reality need have no fear that he has fallen back into primitive demonology\"122 during the course of development. For this understanding brings knowledge that both the gods and the demons serve purpose. Thus, again, it becomes quite important for an individual to adhere to some sort of belief system at all stages of personal development. As one advances, a common substratum of unity becomes increasingly apparent - even to the point where it can be seen that the contrast, or similar opposition in our universal system hails from the same source and serves grand purpose toward our rise to enlightened consciousness. Man’s longing for redemption is universal and only has selfish motives in rare cases. file:///D|/Occultism,%20Hermetics,%20Alchemy...%20Consciousness%20Part%201%20The%20Dove.htm (7 of 12) [7/25/03 10:49:59 PM]"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Rise to Consciousness Part 1 The DoveJung theorizes that the best and clearest psychic material comes from persons of sound mind who, driven by some kind of spiritual distress, or for religious, philosophical, or psychological reasons devote particular attention to their unconscious mind. The period extending from the Middle Ages to Roman times placed a natural emphasis on the inner man, and since psychological criticism became possible only with the rise of science and organized religion, a person’s inner factors were then able to reach higher levels of consciousness and this could be portrayed in the form of projections or visions much more easily than can be achieved today. Mankind was more free to live the personal myth. With the development of stylized science and religion, mankind lost the ability to bridge the dimensions of consciousness, even becoming subject to the trials and atrocities of The Inquisition involving various tortures and even death for believing and living the personal myth, or for remaining in personal contact with the archetypal realms. When made to conform to socially enforced principles concerning the nature of mankind and God, humans began to fall from consciousness at an alarmingly devastating rate. The rebels, or heretics then were forced to carry the guilt and burden of their inner knowledge to an often early demise. Our world slowly became more entrapped in the lower dimensions, and in a self-righteous fervor, we began to Christianize and thereby standardize even the native heretics. Jung spent a great deal of time studying the life of Paracelsus, a well noted, fifteenth century German philosopher, alchemist, and physicist. Paracelsus is quoted as having said: \"Man has a natural light, but also a light outside the light of nature by which he can seek out supernatural things... And it should be known that when a man prophesies, he does not speak from the Devil and not from the Holy Spirit, but from the innate spirit of the invisible body in which man has his origin.\" In his treatise entitled De vita longa, Paracelsus wrote in Latin, Greek, Italian, Hebrew, and perhaps even Arabic. The ancient sacred languages held metaphors and symbols for each stroke, each letter, each syllable, and each word. Paracelsus purposely distorted words, using anagrams and metaphors to hide or encrypt meanings to all but the spiritually enlightened, who would understand and read with inner vision.In a study of Paracelsus as an alchemic philosopher, as well as a physician, one could easily perceive his life and writing style as a direct effort to achieve a spiritual cause and to bring forth light through the conscious mind. The same holds true for Michel de Nostradame (Nostradamus) and the many prophets and seers down the through ages. Within in-depth peshers are found historical tales, prophecy, and often alchemical life formulas. It is often only through this method that a multidimensional message can be portrayed in its fullest aspect without undue criticism or censorship. It is also through peshers and symbolism that this type message can hold its translation without haphazard attempts to decipher it, as well as be preserved throughout the file:///D|/Occultism,%20Hermetics,%20Alchemy...%20Consciousness%20Part%201%20The%20Dove.htm (8 of 12) [7/25/03 10:49:59 PM]"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Rise to Consciousness Part 1 The Doveages in the very least as a divine work of art. The intent of a seer is critically important and must be held closely to divine cause in order to not become self serving. The very choice and sounds of the words of Daniel, Ezekiel, John of Revelation, Isaiah, Paracelsus, Nostradamus, the Irish bards, sacred poets, and many other highly developed conscious minds through the eons convey climactic spiritual visions that could be literally portrayed only by the fantasia of poets using archetypal symbols. In psychological studies, symbols are signs with cultural and transitory meanings created by humans. Symbols and archetypes are considered significant forces in the psyche and are often seen as carriers of psychic energy. \"Symbols cultivate wholeness and are a bridge between the conscious and unconscious resulting in the process of individuation and self-realization... Archetypes are living organisms that promote change in the depths of the human psyche.\"The therapeutical goal of Jungian psychology is to make the symbolic process conscious. Symbols direct us to the center of our being. Jungian psychology also focuses on the metaphorical perception of the mythic dimension of life. The mind is quite multidimensional and requires metaphorical images to intellectualize the higher planes of existence. Therefore, it is even more conceivable for one who has achieved enlightened consciousness to draw forth from the psyche divine archetypes or symbols that solicit immediate, conscious interpretation that supersedes all cultural and language barriers (a rose in any language is a rose). Aristotle well knew the importance of metaphors in the assimilation of intuitive perception into our conscious awareness when he stated:\"The greatest thing by far is to be a master of metaphor; it is one thing that cannot be learnt from others; and it is also a sign of genius, since a good metaphor implies an intuitive perception of the similarity in the dissimilar.\"Images represent your spiritual condition. As metaphors they bring together body and soul. It is important to your spiritual life to accomplish reunion of the soul and body, because you must be embodied before you can receive spirit. The power of the spirit cannot be received until consciousness (light in matter) is in the body. Although the will must be quite focused, consciousness is a process that has more to do with images than will, mostly because the will should be used to focus the process but not to interfere with it. \"Becoming conscious in advanced stages means being aware of your fantasies and recognizing them everywhere including in your spiritual belief system. Your fantasies are not separate from your reality, but instrumental in forming your experience of it. The alchemist can suspend one state of consciousness for another. You can analyze by means of your fantasies, and then translate reality back into fantasy images.\"While there are no real subdivisions or degrees of consciousness, there are degrees of awareness of it. The \"Rise to Consciousness\" is evident in one who has completed development from the dark stages of unconsciousness, blending the level of the imaginative consciousness, through the level of the inspirational consciousness, to the level of the intuitive consciousness, to enlightenment. Having gone through the various levels of awareness, one begins to see that consciousness just file:///D|/Occultism,%20Hermetics,%20Alchemy...%20Consciousness%20Part%201%20The%20Dove.htm (9 of 12) [7/25/03 10:49:59 PM]"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"Rise to Consciousness Part 1 The DoveIS and really has no division. Upon understanding what is meant by enlightened consciousness, one can also begin to see the unity, wholeness, grace, beauty, and continuity of life. Life becomes full of purpose and a great desire to protect and live it to the fullest takes on new meaning and impetus. As Paracelsus stated, man has both a natural and a supernatural light to aid in his development. Illumination is the goal, and brings one to unity with the whole. The simple understanding or illumination that the soul seeks is that GOD surrounds, but the nature of God is incomprehensible. The distinguished mark of the spiritual person is that they seek self-knowledge and knowledge of the Unknowable. The soul can accept this Unknowing only when it has understood itSELF as being part of that Unknowing.As Plato once said, \"Gnothi seauton\" (Know ThySelf). Ancient wisdom from the Delphic oracles also attest that in order for one to meet God, one is to \"Know ThySELF\". This is no easy task, as it embodies the entire challenge of mankind as a whole, and each person within their individual aspect of that whole. No two paths will be the same, although they all lead back to the same source. To know one’s SELF is to acknowledge and know God. The conscious light within is that which can show us The Way.Every religion comes from the same source and every human seeks the principle of God, even if under a different name. Even an atheist has a God - the divinity or belief in SELF, or the personal consciousness. Regardless of religious beliefs, the method of worship, or the code by which one lives, it seems feasible to conclude that both mankind's dilemma and the greatest drama lie in the quest for consciousness (light) or God. This indeed is the real message of all religions and all mankind knows that there is a source from which all life is derived - and there is a reason whether scientific or philosophical, that life has arisen in this dimension. That reason is God. It is only through SELF that SELF knowledge and union can be found. We have the blessings of others to which we are truly united as a whole in the substratum of the soul. However, as individual units of consciousness, our downward spiral from the source has created veils of illusion that cast us as being separate and alone. Until these veils are dissolved, the soul in ascension feels it has been cast into dark corners of the universe quite alone and without comparison. This is a seemingly lone quest and all are born into the world alone, pass through it alone, and will transcend it alone. However, this is true only to the extent that one believes it. What is true about it is that one is individually responsible for their personal rise to consciousness. When one discovers that the whole cannot be complete without human interpersonal relationships, they realize that they are not alone and rejoice in great compassion. The veil is lifted and one can see the others on path. One who has achieved any degree of success on the path feels compelled to urge others along and to help them with all honest intent. After having achieved a certain level of \"Jacob’s Ladder\", the initiate is grievously pained to assist others, but this is in vain. Seldom does one see that they cannot do this for them, but comfort is found in knowing that the spirit of compassion is a solvent that acts on the veils of others. The desire to lessen the burden of others and help them along speaks loudly through the substratum, the collective unconsciousness of all souls. It is in this manner that one greatly assists another.file:///D|/Occultism,%20Hermetics,%20Alchemy...%20Consciousness%20Part%201%20The%20Dove.htm (10 of 12) [7/25/03 10:49:59 PM]"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Rise to Consciousness Part 1 The Dove A person cannot endow another with wisdom and understanding for it is not to give. It is a gift for each to experience, and the best we can hope to offer another is a \"seed\". If a seed is cast on fertile ground, it will blossom through active, natural processes. If overly fertilized or watered too much, it decays, but if left to its natural evolutionary process, it will normally let the good farmer know its needs through its very essence. The good farmer responds accordingly. Ministers, theologians, philosophers, politicians, and many other sorts all desire to be farmers, but many force the seed into ill nourished soil and many seek the harvest before the crop has been properly nurtured, often for self-profit or self-aggrandizing purpose. Instead of the natural farming methods, tainting pollutants (concepts) deter the growth process and try to make all the plants uniform with the farmer who places himself in charge of the evolution of the crop. Many heretical plants simply do not conform, so get weeded out and cast aside. Often they reroot themSELVES and grow better on the sidelines in among the weeds than they do in the neatly planted rows. Even the weeds cannot choke them out. Then, all too often some simply decay and are lost into the dust to further reduce to base atoms and eventually rejoin the flow of life in restructured form. On the other hand, consider the waysided plant that reaches fruition. It first renders forth a great outcoming and finding no further need for the stem, will quite normally decay and will also reduce itSELF to base atoms and eventually rejoin the life forces. Often, in the process, the healthy plant will reseed itSELF in order that it may propagate and further enhance the crop. Often also, this crop will take such firm rooting that all attempts to conform it are quite useless (\"Old heretics never die, they are just reborn as heretics\"). Absolute Truth in all of its evolution will never be lost to the human psyche. Throughout the collective unconscious of mankind, it holds its form and substance in great archetypes that withstand the tests of time, reality perspectives, and perceptual shifts. It is absolute in the sense that it can be considered a unified substance or principle which infinitely contains and is the infinite container which self propagates the multifarious recognition called existence. Thus, we see numerous references in various cultures of a \"Self-Existent ONE who brings forth all things by issuing them from Him(Her)Self\". Absolute Truth is constant in the sense that our perception of it remains in the highest realms of consciousness, making it the ultimate reality for which, as evolving units of the whole, we anticipate answers and conclusions concerning IT’s nature. Thereby existence (consciousness) evolves as it constantly seeks expression by manifesting as a reflection of itSELF. Each new reorganization of existence endows life with sincerity relating to quality and purpose. By way of \"Change\" - the multi-tiered phenomena through which we rise to consciousness, this Eminent Potential impels us through it inherent, and, often to us, unconscious nature to affirm then attain our highest goal. That goal is the self realization that we are potentially that same Absolute Truth... moving in itSELF conveying via archetypes the universal truths of it’s nature which do not change - analogous to the inner watcher that is the catalyst of all our personal metamorphoses, if not identical to it. file:///D|/Occultism,%20Hermetics,%20Alchemy...%20Consciousness%20Part%201%20The%20Dove.htm (11 of 12) [7/25/03 10:49:59 PM]"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"Rise to Consciousness Part 1 The Doveby DX888@aol.comThis material is copyright protected. © 2001 All rights reserved.

Whether evidenced as the law of cause and effect, karma, fate, or heaven and hell, our thinking is the tangible force that creates our perception of the universe and the world around us. This universal law establishes the guidelines by which we live and die, and eventually transcend the need for living and dying. Harold Percival has this to say on thought: \"The power of a thought is enormous and superior to all the successive physical acts, objects, and events that body forth its energy. A thought often endures for a time much greater than the whole life of the man who thought it.\" As you think, then so you become - and so becomes your destiny! The balancing of thought is critical in the course of development - the rise to consciousness. Most teachings advance the need to be in control of what you think, as much as what you do. Putting this to practice does not mean that as a human, one is perfected in thought, but that serious attempts are made to balance the ones that arise. By paying conscious attention to the way one thinks and what one thinks, a person begins to see personal patterns of thought arise that seek balance and close attention. If not addressed right away, the cause is stored and will seek it’s effect in accordance with fulfillment of the law, because \"for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction\". This lies in close proximity with the universal law of balance (justice) and The Union and Reunion of Opposites.In an orderly universe there are no accidents nor coincidences. All actions are exteriorizations of thought, whether balanced or imbalanced. Every product that has been designed and developed, every building that has been built, every book that has been written, every action committed - everything that IS - was first a thought in the mind of it’s creator. The Hermetic axiom \"As Above, So Below\" applies on multidimensional levels, including the incessantly active realm of thought. Often people see events as the will of God, but it may be better stated that God wills justice according to the measures that you mete. Religious doctrines argue that man’s thinking takes him away from God and intellectualizes a human spiritual process that is best left tended only by God and his mysterious methods. There indeed comes a point in every course of spiritual development where the thinking human turns away from all mention of God and considers atheism because of the farcity, human oriented intent, and other multitudinous, non-spiritual aspects of religion. Studies of various science and philosophical systems offer branching avenues of thought both inclusive and exclusive of God. That same thinking human after plodding through myriads of earthly and unearthly experience, once again turns to SELF and admits that there is indeed a God, albeit of a different definition than the surface God that is being represented to the masses. No thinking intelligence can permanently deny God, whether called by that name or some other.

With the rise of technology it has become possible to define in understandable terms that which previously had no explanation - the dualistic human process of inner and outer growth which affects not only humans and their world in third dimensional existence and beyond, but all life throughout the quantum universes. Once the bridge between science and philosophy has been made complete, we will begin to see that there has never been a true discrepancy. That bridge is consciousness. The hotly debated scientific versus philosophical solution to mankind’s quest concerning human nature and the gods becomes a moot point. It will be found that the scientist and the philosopher speak of the same phenomena, yet in similar, but different languages. The scientific speaks the language of exoteric geometry relating to a physical, tangible realm. The philosopher speaks the language of esoteric geometry relating to an ethereal realm. It will also become obvious, that in all fairness to ancient wisdom and it’s misunderstood symbology, it has maintained sound and immutable philosophical and scientific principles and knowledge. However, this has been contained solely within the language of various philosophical systems and most often sometimes secretively and intentionally so in order to preserve integrity.There are many paths leading to Truth. The path of consciousness according to mystics is an innate reality for us and the key to the mysteries of God and the universe. It is considered by mystics the closest source of energy, harmony, and knowledge of Self and God. Therefore, they have resolved throughout the ages to uphold that consciousness cannot be measured by scientific file:///D|/Occultism,%20Hermetics,%20Alchemy%...%20Union%20and%20Reunion%20of%20Opposites.htm (1 of 6) [7/25/03 10:50:15 PM]"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"The Union and Reunion of Oppositesmeans, but also cannot be discredited by it, because it does not exist purely in the temporal realm. The path of the scientist, who focuses on the external realms and strives to explain the world through measures in space and time, still is forced to follow the laws of cause and effect, or action versus reaction - the same laws upheld by the philosophers. Thereby, followers of each method end up on the same path, for one cannot be understood nor explained in an acceptable, coherent manner without the other. \"Nature is a great open book in which everything can be found, if we learn to draw from it the inspiration which it has given to thinkers of all ages. If we learn her language, nature will reveal to us all the laws of life and the universe.\"It is within the science of human biology and the wisdom of human philosophy wherein lies our immediate concern. Both the biological and the spiritual processes of human evolution are natural and inevitable. These will occur with or without our conscious will being focused toward that cause. This is referred to as action through inaction, because the entire universe is an infinitely moving, changing, living force. Even if we take no conscious action to understand or keep pace with that force, we are contained within it and thereby totally affected by it as separate units and as a whole. There is no way to ignore it and it is this force that drives the unconscious to become aware of itSELF - and to seek the counterbalance of consciousness and enlightenment -The Union and Reunion of Opposites. In one sense, this is UNION, because we have never really as humans possessed the SELF, and in another sense it is REUNION, or redemption, because we are getting back the SELF that belongs to us.The Source of our being is sound. Transmitted sound oscillates creating quantum particle waves (frequencies) measurable in cycles per second (hertz units). The resonating particle waves constitute the various dimensional realms and the oscillation rate determines how the waves are banded together within a dimension. Various rates of frequency actually determine the density of sound and as it slows and gains distance/separation from its originating point it both expands and moves through the formation of light, the color spectrum, and finally spirals downward into matter, composed of atoms. The atom is spherical with electrons orbiting the nucleus. Through magnetic force, the positive particles within the nucleus bonded with an equal number of negative particles outside the nucleus create the neutrality of the atom. Atoms cluster and grow in harmonic sequence according to direct oscillation from the Source. As the cluster becomes larger and more dense, the orbit of the atoms is reduced in speed and the matter becomes even more dense. The atom resonates forth and back between two dimensions at such a high rate that it creates its own dual, null resonance wave (similar opposite polarities) which is the balance of the forces of inertia and gravity. This null resonance wave is known in modern physics as the electromagnetic \"zero point\" and is the center of the electron and the time reversed positron. According to the conclusions of some contemporary physicists, mass and gravity are not real, but assumed, and gravity is a fluctuation force produced when atoms react within a vacuum of energy. Gravity determines space and time, and when the gravitational force is reduced, the space/time continuum is transcended. Thus, contained within matter itSELF is a vacuum - a quantum wave of calm inner space that has its own resonance and energy and esoterically speaking, is the place of union with the force known as God. This vacuum has no distance and no time and may well be considered the realm or dimension of angels. It may also be considered the realm of consciousness wherein the past, present, and future are seen in the same light. file:///D|/Occultism,%20Hermetics,%20Alchemy%...%20Union%20and%20Reunion%20of%20Opposites.htm (2 of 6) [7/25/03 10:50:15 PM]"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"The Union and Reunion of OppositesOnce the atom gains high density and has thereby altered its ability to produce a balanced null resonance wave, it becomes less capable of receiving direct oscillation, or impetus from the Source, and is thereby considered a resistor. This is exemplified in the basic foundations of electricity, as when the electron is shielded by a resistor the movement of electrons in the energy field is slowed. In this situation, the atom then flounders, spiraling downward toward the more dense, physical realms. On the other hand, it if spins too fast and loses too much density, or becomes too conductive, it also loses the delicate balance that affords the null resonance wave. It then becomes ethereal and spiraling upward, detaches from the physical realms. In this condition it remains an energy, but one that science has not defined. In relationship to the rise to higher consciousness, this upward ethereal ascension may seem desirable. However, while many esoteric systems teach ascension, if this process occurs prematurely and without all the faculties having been fully prepared, it can result in ill effects in the improperly balanced/aligned atomic mass, or even cause combustion. For this reason it appears critical to balance the atomic structure of both the inner body of light and the outer body of flesh in order to keep the channels clear to the Source. In other words, our immediate goal should be balance, or The Union and Reunion of Opposites. When the opposite polarities are balanced, only then can one ascend.Another aspect of atomic biology is the double helix structure of DNA, symbolized in medicine and philosophy by the caduceus (two serpents entwined on a staff). The naturally alchemized elements in the body produce a connective, magnetic field around the double helix and this field may serve as a conductive path or channel for higher forces (literally a physical, conductive gateway between the inner light body and the physical body).The structure of both the atom and the DNA and their function in human life is not only the critical substance of biological and physical science, but also of philosophy and religion. An understanding of how they interrelate with the higher life forces - and the Source - points one toward the pathway of The Union and Reunion of Opposites.In philosophical terms, The Union and Reunion of Opposites is described as the integration and unification of the conscious and the unconscious. This is symbolized in every conceivable pair of opposites (i.e. God/Satan, Sun/Moon, light/dark, male/female, fire/water, active/passive, life/ death, etc.) The harmonizing of the functions of consciousness brings into balance thinking, sensing, feeling, and intuition. These are symbolized in the four alchemical elements of fire, air, earth, and water. At the same time these four functions are being brought into harmony, the fully integrated consciousness must be unified with its polar opposite - unconsciousness. The strife between the opposites creates the rotation (oscillation) of the elements and the task of the SELF is to harmonize these elements in order to maintain a balanced rotation (the same referred to as the null resonance wave produced by polarization of the atom). Such is the task of the alchemical philosopher. file:///D|/Occultism,%20Hermetics,%20Alchemy%...%20Union%20and%20Reunion%20of%20Opposites.htm (3 of 6) [7/25/03 10:50:15 PM]"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"The Union and Reunion of OppositesThe tale of the unification of opposites is seen not only in alchemy, but throughout all philosophical and religious systems in all world cultures. Many ancient, pagan symbols are borrowed to show the process of illumination, and the trials and tasks of many mythological archetypes represent the same. For example, the Archangel Michael victoriously slays the dragon, Jason the Argonaut through hardship and trial collects the golden fleece, and Heracles is triumphantly announced a hero-king after methodically completing a series of esoteric tasks that prove his worthiness and bring his enlightenment. Egyptian tales are abound with gods and goddesses, priests and priestesses, who achieve their rise to consciousness through varied ordeals. Chinese myth holds high the tale of the dragon and the egg, symbolic of divine wisdom. This same symbolism is taken to a national scale in the slaying of the dragons of Scotland by St. George, and of Ireland by St. Patrick. The Archangel Michael is not only the protectorate of the Hebrews, but remains a Christian iconic hero, who not only slays the ultimate dragon of Revelation, but the more individualized dragons that torment his people.The esoteric symbol of the winged and wingless dragon/serpent throughout all cultures, of which Jung took the heroic step of trying to explain, is seen in terms of the conscious/unconscious mind. The dragon is often synonymous with the dual aspect of the serpent, which as the caduceus represents, is both conscious/unconscious. The dragon is the \"mercurial serpent\" and is also synonymous with the divine water and egg, and it’s symbolism goes back as far as Lilith, or Melusina, who lives in the philosophical tree. Later, Christ appears as the archetype of consciousness and Mercurius as the archetype of unconsciousness. Thereby, the dragon is related closely to the creative godhead in symbolism, and also represents the union of opposites. The androgynous uroborous dragon impregnates, bears, devours, and slays itself; then lifts itself on high, paraphrasing the mystery of God’s sacrificial death. It is also said of Mercurius that, he will make you a witness of the mysteries of God and secrets of nature, and that he is the messenger of the gods. Mercurius, the dragon/serpent, is never himself the light, but a bringer of the light, as seen in the symbolism of Venus (symbolic of both Lucifer - the bringer of light, and Christ - the light). Those who are ignoring of this bringer of light turn the dragon into a diabolical seducer.file:///D|/Occultism,%20Hermetics,%20Alchemy%...%20Union%20and%20Reunion%20of%20Opposites.htm (4 of 6) [7/25/03 10:50:15 PM]"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"The Union and Reunion of Opposites The dragon represents the initial state of unconsciousness because it loves to \"dwell in caverns and dark places\". Unconsciousness must be sacrificed, and only then can the entrance into the head be found, and the way to conscious knowledge and understanding. The alchemist is instructed to take the dragon, cut through it with the dividing sword, and take it’s soul incorporating it into the aspect of consciousness. Thus, one never really slays the dragon, but instead transforms it’s unconscious substance to higher consciousness. The universal struggle of the hero with the dragon is thereby enacted, and at its victorious conclusion the Sun rises, consciousness dawns, and it is perceived that transformation (illumination) is taking place. Carl Sagan described the three tiers of the human brain as the reptilian (the most ancient and deepest layer), the limbic (the middle tier that directs motor sensory and normal life functions), and the neocortex (the uncharted territory of the upper realms). He also used the symbolic dragon to portray the dormant, sleeping, reptilian part of the brain that is both ancient and undisturbed. When the sleeping dragon rises, his fire (kundalini?) surges throughout the various layers and in alchemical measures awakens and integrates the triune brain. The dragon’s breath strikes far into the upper neocortex stimulating areas that have either been undiscovered in modern humans, or perhaps areas that we used in prior eons and from which we have fallen. In either case these areas are not accessible to humans without focused will and effort toward developing higher consciousness. This model of the triune brain is somewhat explanatory of the esoteric terminology of the chariot (limbic system) that draws the Sun (neocortex) and the Moon (reptilian), carrying them forth into the heavens (mystical union where all opposites are united). For some, the exoteric language of geometry, spoken in mathematical and scientific terminology, brings the universal principles into cohesion and clarity enabling one to understand the inconceivable nature of the world of the opposites. The scientist reduces his symbols to physical substance. For others, nothing short of the esoteric language of geometry, spoken in symbols and mythological archetypes, can satisfy the soul’s deep longing to conceive that which they know to be true, but is unspeakable in ordinary terms. The symbols of the mystic philosopher are reduced to personal experience. In either case, none have found The Way to higher consciousness purely through exoteric nor esoteric paths. One complements the other, and only when Absolute Truth is sought through combined avenues with multifaceted understanding, will pure understanding and divine enlightenment present itself.Bibliography\"Prometheus stole the flame from the gods offering it to mankind until it became common property.

Mythology comes nearest to it of any.\" Henry David Thoreau The eternal, universal principle of the relationship between the Macrocosm and the Microcosm, and their combined relationship to the mythological archetypes is one that is as indispensable now in understanding the nature and existence of mankind as it was during the rise of the great philosophers of the Renaissance. While the Renaissance philosophers bring to us a closer understanding of how humans at the time related to the cosmos, this principle found its Source in even more ancient philosophical/religious thought. The principle of the Macrocosm-Microcosm holds that the rules and forces shaping and governing the human body are the same as those shaping and governing the entire universe; thereby, each human is a miniature cosmos. This ideology combined with an understanding and analysis of the mythological archetypes that portray the multidimensional history of mankind, begins to shed the light of understanding on matters that seem both esoteric and insurmountable to the human mind. Indeed, it can be seen that the mythologies actually speak the language of the cosmos in a symbolic and archetypal fashion that surpasses cultural and language barriers, and that therein lies the truest, unabridged version of human history, as well as the history of the universe(s) and that multifarious recognition we call God. As a statement of how the multidimensional universe works, it implies the reality of \"action at a distance\", the idea that forces can act upon and interact with objects seemingly without directly touching them. This idea supports Paracelsus’ notion that all the sciences combine to constitute that which is called creation, and that each of them intricately interacts with the other. No singular, specific science can be conclusive about our origin, nor our existence.file:///D|/Occultism,%20Hermetics,%20Alchemy%20...Microcosm%20and%20Mythological%20Archetypes.htm (1 of 5) [7/25/03 10:50:22 PM]"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"Rise To Consciousness Part4 The idea of man as a Microcosm, representative both externally and internally of the earth or the universe, is idealistic of a primitive, original state of consciousness. This is wisely expressed in the following:\"Man is esteemed to be a little world, and in all respects he is to be compared to a world. The bones under his skin are likened to mountains, for by them the body is strengthened, even as the earth is by rocks, and the flesh is taken for earth, and the great blood vessels for rivers, and the little ones for small streams that pour into great rivers. The bladder is the sea, wherein the great as well as the small streams congregate. The hair is compared to sprouting herbs, the nails on the hand and feet, and whatever else may be discovered inside and outside a man, all according to its kind is compared to the world.\"A similar concept of the human as a Microcosm is taught by the Essenes in The Gospel of Peace, wherein it is shown that humans contain within themselves the very essence of the Earthly Mother. The words of Jesus are cited wherein he speaks of the both the heavenly and the earthly nature of man,\"I tell you truly, you are one with the Earthly Mother; she is in you and you in her... ...The hardness of our bones is bone of the bones of our Earthly Mother, of the rocks and of the stones... ...The tenderness of our flesh is born of the flesh of our Earthly Mother... ...Except a man be born of the Earthly Mother and the Heavenly Father and walk with the Angels of the Day and the Night, he cannot enter into the Eternal Kingdom.\"In addition to being of the flesh of the Earthly Mother, humans are also considered Microcosms of the Heavenly Father and the temporal Cosmos (represented by the stars and universe). This triplicity combined as the Macrocosm personifies itself in humans. When an individual acknowledges awareness of the SELF as a personification of the Macrocosm, it is at this point that one can begin to integrate and bridge the gaps in consciousness that make a person appear as separate and alone. It is also at this point that one can start to embody higher dimensions of their quantum SELF (be born of the Earthly Mother, the Heavenly Father, and the temporal Cosmos) and walk with the angels (a conscious ability professed by both the Essenes and the Egyptians). In his treatise on astronomy, Paracelsus wrote that the firmament does not exert a compelling force upon man, but that man himself acts upon the worlds more than they influence him. He stated that \"The stars are subject to the philosopher, they must follow him, and not he them.\" And from the wisdom of Paracelsus concerning the Macrocosm-Microcosm: file:///D|/Occultism,%20Hermetics,%20Alchemy%20...Microcosm%20and%20Mythological%20Archetypes.htm (2 of 5) [7/25/03 10:50:22 PM]"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"Rise To Consciousness Part4\"The whole word surrounds man as a circle surrounds one point. From this it follows that all things are related to this one point, no differently from an apple seed which is surrounded and preserved by the fruit, and which draws it sustenance from it... Similarly, man is a seed and the world is his apple; and just as the seed fares in the apple, so does man fare in the world, which surrounds him... Each thing has its own origin; partly in the eternal, and partly in the temporal. And wisdom, whether it be heavenly or earthly, can be achieved only through the attractive force of the center and the circle...Everything that comes from the flesh is animal and follows an animal course; heaven has little influence on it. Only that which comes from the stars is specifically human in us; this is subject to their influence. But that which comes from the spirit, the divine part of man, has been formed in us in the likeness of God, and upon this neither earth nor heaven has any influence.You should look upon man as a part of nature whose end lies in heaven. In the heavens you can see man, each part for himself; for man is made of heaven. And the matter out of which man was created also indicates to you the pattern after which he was formed... Heaven is man, and man is heaven, and all men together are the one heaven, and heaven is nothing but one man. You know this to understand why one place is this way and the other that way, why this is new and that is old, and why there are everywhere so many diverse things. But this cannot be discovered by studying the heavens... All that can be discovered is the distribution of their active influences... We, men, have a heaven, and it lies in each of us in entire plentitude, undivided and corresponding to each man’s specificity. Thus, each human life takes its own course, thus dying, death and disease are un evenly distributed, in each case according to the actions of the heavens. For if the same heaven were in all of us, all men would have to be equally sick and equally healthy. But this is not so; the unity of the Great Heaven is split into our diversities by the various moments at which we are born. As soon as a child is conceived, it receives its own heaven. If all children had been born at the same moment, all of them would have the same heaven in them, and their lives would follow the same course. Therefore, the starry vault imprints itself on the inner heaven of man. A miracle without equal!\"Paracelsus goes even further in elaborating on the inner Microcosm of humans being related to the macrocosmic stars. Through a certain mental faculty our spirit can by imitation be made like to some star, so that it is filled with the characteristics and functions of it. He states that each human was created great and noble and that they can only be understood as an image of the Macrocosm, the Great Creator:\"The inner stars of man are, in their properties, kind, and nature, by their course and position, like his outer stars, and different only in form and material.

The same atom that once had its home in some distant star finds its way into eventually the human lifestream. Thus, humans, likened unto the Creator (the Heavenly Father, the Earthly Mother and the Temporal Cosmos) - are triplistic in nature and thereby bound in creation through the trinity. One cannot ignore the flesh of the Mother, the spirit of the Cosmos, nor the heavenly essence of the Father, for these are the same of which one is comprised. Considering that humans are Microcosms and contain within the infinite substance of that which can be both visually and spiritually confirmed, the archetypes of the collective unconscious become a little more comprehensive in nature. The great, misunderstood mythologies preserved throughout the ages of mankind become no longer just archetypal sagas of fantasized gods, goddesses, heroes, heroines, dragons, winged creatures, and the like; but instead, are better understood as the content of the multidimensional human structure, as well as a symbolic language in which to record multidimensional actions. Therefore, archetypes might be defined as the form of the inner substance. Mythology might best be defined as the collective stories of the higher dimensions, or Macrocosm, as they relate to dimensional physicality becoming the Microcosm. Quantum physics implicitly substantiates having more than one existence in more than one realm simultaneously, in essence multidimensional bodies. The fact that the atom rapidly oscillates between two dimensions is supportive of the fact that humans, comprised of atomic substance, consist of both the inner and outer bodies. The vacuum created by the balance of inertia and gravity is the realm of consciousness and the home of the gods. Perhaps there really was a time when consciousness was more wholly integrated in human existence - a golden time when the divine archetypes without hindrance traveled, conversed, and lived with and as humans.Or, perhaps it is simply as Jung claims, that the more complex emotional states became complicated and as constituents, gathered the characteristics of personalities. In the phenomenology of religion, many of the earlier gods developed from persons into abstract ideas. Many of the old gods have become descriptive attributes to human characteristics.

It is the form of our deepest unconsciousness, as well as our highest consciousness. Each human lives their personal myth in just as real a way as the third dimensional existence around them is experienced. Most people are externally unaware of their own trinity, thereby they know not consciously of their personal myth, or of the many interdimensional bodies of which they are comprised. However, deep at the root of the SELF, the personal myth lurks and strikes at the surface often enough to command attention and frequently creates what is known to the uninitiated as phenomena. During the personal rise to consciousness, on the road to The Union and Reunion of Opposites, one learns to bridge the gaps between the dimensions of the inner and outer SELF and integrate their many faces into one whole being - which is part and particle of the ALL in ALL - the triplistic, divine Macrocosm. It is then that the language of mythology becomes comprehensible and even preferable to the culturally stifling, limiting, external dialogues of the human race.

What about prophecy?The mind is influenced by many powerful forces and in and of itself sets up a personal moral system which guides our thoughts and actions. The spirit and soul substance are the primary factors that embue mind with life force. The emotional body carries the memory and traces of all that has happened and based on these experiences, helps the mind determine how to react to given events as they occur based on memory of how similar events felt in the past. In the course of human life, the mind is thereby affected from all our inner human bodies, as well as from outer bodies and influences. Thus, one might ascertain that the mind is the \"computing\" device of the human - and quite often a battleground of light and darkness as we struggle to spiral beyond the need for polarity during our rise to consciousness. Often called the \"Union and Reunion of Opposites\", polarity is a necessity within our dimension and is seen in all facets of our existence from God/Satan all the way up and down the scale from good/evil, light/darkness, hatred/love, joy/pain, black/white, and all in between. Contrast is important and manifests in every approach we take and it arises in most all decisions that we make. Contrast gives us a means of weighing thought to produce outcome probabilities and take action based on logical assumptions. It is needed in order to make decisions, and to provide boundaries for learning. But, there comes a point in human development when the need for contrast no longer exists. We define what we have accepted about God (the Knowable/Unknowable) and Satan simply ceases to exist. By our vast life experiences, we teach ourselves a moral code differentiating good and evil. We learn to realize that light and darkness bring forth the same inner result and one is recognizable only by the other. We learn that both black and white are colorless, and that tears of joy are as fierce as tears of pain. It is then that our thinking leads us to balance and we can weave in and out of contrast in life without our inner bodies being immensely altered. We can more easily allow the natural flow of events in our life, guided immensely by the omnipotent spirit/soul which remains untainted by the diversions of contrast in the mind.

The most intense challenge of all in knowing ourSELVES is in mastering the ebb and flow of the emotional body, which is the storage room for excess baggage. The emotional body stores aromas and a myriad of audiovisual imagery to aid the mind in remembering events and in making decisions how to think and feel about what is currently occurring. What we think and feel about situations has a large role in deciding our actions. Therefore, one might conclude that the occurrences of our life and the often unconscious mark they leave upon our emotional body is largely a determining factor in how we think and how we meet the present - and the future. So, is our life and its events determined by what is fed into the mind via the emotional and spiritual/soul bodies nurtured by physical actualities? Where does the powerful force of free will come into effect? What about destiny? Do our free will decisions based on our thinking create destiny? The Law of Thought, according to Harold W. Percival, states that thinking is the basic factor in shaping human destiny. Whether evidenced as the law of cause and effect, karma, fate, or heaven and hell, our thinking is the tangible force that creates our perception of the universe and the world around us. This universal law establishes the guidelines by which we live and die, and eventually transcend the need for living and dying. Percival has this to say on thought: \"The power of a thought is enormous and superior to all the successive physical acts, objects, and events that body forth its energy. A thought often endures for a time much greater than the whole life of the man who thought it.\" As you think, then so you become - and so becomes your destiny! \"This is the law: Every thing existing on the physical plane is an exteriorization of thought, which must be balanced through the one who issued the thought, and in accordance with that one’s responsibility, at the conjunction of time, condition, and place.\" Harold Waldwin Percival   Thus, one could perceive human beings as co-creators of their own existence! Each thought takes tangible form as every creation began first as a thought. This has staggering implications in our multidimensional world as we create both the seen and unseen forces and products around us, as well as live the results of them. It is quite difficult to perceive the enormous power of thought because we cannot always physically see the results. The realms of mind are alive and real and are a powerful force in this dimension with an incessantly active influence on everything and everyone. Thoughts made manifest in the realm of the \"universal mind\", a whole dimension in and of itself, perhaps give life to most of the \"angels\" and \"demons\" that have roamed and intermingled with human affairs over the course of history. In fact, according to ancient gnostic references, the first beings and the world itself were produced by thought (Pronoia/Ennoia) from the omnipotent mind of creator.file:///D|/Occultism,%20Hermetics,%20Alchemy%2...sness%20Part%205%20Thinking%20vs%20Destiny.htm (2 of 5) [7/25/03 10:50:28 PM]"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"Rise To Consciousness To understand how the mind produces tangible effect, first consider that before a physical creation comes into existence, it is first a notion or an urging in the mind of its creator. It then becomes tangible by action of its creator in the form of an invention - a new product or idea. The same creation occurs on inner planes with thoughts that, given enough mental effort, become manifest in the realm of mind. That creation also becomes a new \"product\" or \"idea\" that gains momentum in upper dimensions. Like physical inventions, these products that exist in the realm of the mind remain in existence until they are destroyed or retired by a free will act. Or, they may be superceded by enhanced creations. The balancing of thought is critical in the course of development - the rise to consciousness. Most teachings advance the need to be in control of what you think, as much as what you do - both being elements of free will. Putting this to practice does not mean that as a human, one is perfected in thought, but that serious will-motivated attempts are made through free will to balance the ones that arise. By paying conscious attention to the way one thinks and what one thinks, a person begins to see personal patterns of thought arise that seek balance and close attention. If not addressed right away, the cause is stored and will seek effect in accordance with fulfillment of the law, because \"for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction\". This lies in close proximity with the universal law of balance (justice) and The Union and Reunion of Opposites. In this orderly universe there are no accidents nor coincidences. All actions are exteriorizations of thought, whether balanced or imbalanced. Every product that has been designed and developed, every building that has been built, every book that has been written, every action committed - everything that IS - was first a thought in the mind of a creator. The Hermetic axiom \"As Above, So Below\" applies on multidimensional levels, including the incessantly active realm of thought. A creation exists within and throughout many dimensions. So, in accordance with the Law of Thought - what we think and how we balance our thoughts creates our destiny. Our reality of it is measured, produced, and tempered by free will and thought. And, of course, thought is produced by our emotional, spiritual, and physical experiences. The growth of conscious awareness of the multidimensional mind is a personal responsibility and when we understand ourselves as part of that whole, only then can the agent of free will become a deciding factor in how to alter our course. Until we understand the entirety of our personal existence, we flounder forth and back incessantly falling prey to destiny, largely created by past thought and personal decisions. Quite often we are a \"seeming\" victim of the universal consciousness - the great \"Thunder Perfect\" mind that shows no mercy, in seeking balance. The successful spiritual warrior champions the \"Thunder Perfect\" mind, grasping, battling, and finally balancing the entire measure to which entitled. Each new, successive round of the battle creates an even more fierce warrior with even more intense challenge in facing the great, dark dragon.

Interwoven through strands of time are elements of truths that we have created for ourselves, our destiny produced by free will and thought. Based on the unified consciousness of humanity, we come forth and produce results in the world that affect and interweave the destiny of others. Thus we create a collective destiny in the realm of the universal mind, perhaps the same that Dr. C.G. Jung referred to as the collective unconsciousness (that deep, unified pool which must be drawn forth according to our personal measure). We go forth in leaps and bounds, taking a step forward, a step backward, rerouting, and travailing the course of life with one great certainty - that third dimensional change and movement is ever occurring on a linear path. But, the universal archetype is circular and the linear timelines we create become but spokes setting into motion the Great Wheel of Life, sometimes called the Wheel of Destiny. The spirit, largely unbound by the Wheel of Life has its source in a non-linear dimension. Its manifestation along with the soul and emotional/physical bodies that feed the eternal flow of thought produces the mind of prophecy. Moreover, the mind of prophecy is more often called the \"spirit of prophecy\". Residing within the self-producing realm of light it can \"see\" into the Wheel of Life we have created and provide enlightened input into the spiritually attuned SELF to produce foresight, usually for practical and meaningful purposes, never to be confused with \"fortunetelling\" (an ability that comes from the under-developed, intuitive faculties of denser realms). The infamous, fifteenth-century German physician and alchemical philosopher, Philippus Aureolus Threophrastus Bombastus von Hohenheim, known as Paracelsus, stated that man is \"one part temporal, the other part eternal, and each part takes its light from God and that there is nothing that does not have its origin in God.\" Therefore, as he plainly states in the astrum, \"in man who is made the image of God, can be found both the cause and the medicine\". Contained within human nature is both light (consciousness) and darkness (unconsciousness). Paracelsus is also quoted as having said: \"Man has a natural light, but also a light outside the light of nature by which he can seek out supernatural things... And it should be known that when a man prophesies, he does not speak from the Devil and not from the Holy Spirit, but from the innate spirit of the invisible body in which man has his origin.\" It is this innate spirit of our origin that enables prophecy to manifest - based on the observations made from the realm of light. We create the Wheel of Destiny by our free will thoughts and actions, and prophecy exists partly to help us see and correct the balance of that which we have created. Prophecy also exists to help humankind see the salvatory plan of heaven for our lives, to help us see the interdimensional existence of the universal mind, and to guide our thinking toward a higher, unified consciousness that transcends the smallness of what we have grown to think of ourselves, and most of all - to point us toward the highest divinity.

Constant growth and change occurs around and within our condition regardless of whether or not we consciously choose or direct it in our universe of incessant, sweeping motion. The Swiss psychologist, Dr. C.G. Jung, made a somewhat casual allusion to this involuntary, incessant growth as “action through inaction.” Regardless of whether we consciously participate in the motion that drives us as individuals, growth continues and all activity reaches some stage of resolve, or balance in its due course. When in direct touch with the highest state of our consciousness, we catch a brief glimpse of that driving force that maintains the shifting state of our universe. However, since most of the time we are bound within four dimensions of our multidimensional being, we cannot always consciously see or feel the entirety of the levels of atomic change all around us. The earth rotates and we become accustomed to our 16,000 mile per hour revolutionary journey through the cosmos. All the cosmos is in motion - yet the ever swirling mass of materiality within the individual in tune to the revolution of the third dimension, seemingly remains in place. The atoms in our body vibrate, rapidly intermingling our consciousness between one realm and another. Still we feel as if we are standing quite still, passing through measured motion. Thus we experience the measured activity of our lives through the cosmos as “time.”Throughout time and other dimensions, our multidimensional selves fulfill an existence referred to by the ancients as the Macrocosm-Microcosm. As stated by Hermes Trismegistus,\"True without deceit, certain and most true - what is below is like what is above and what is above is like what is below, for the performing of the marvels of the one thing.\"The entire cosmos and the parts of the human - spirit, soul, mental, emotional, and physical integrate to form our multidimensional experience.

Before this reunion with the Divine can complete the process, a “Battle of the Shadows” is waged yielding and purging the ancient shadows of the entire history of the soul. This battle occurs within many dimensions simultaneously, and only when we reach a state of higher awareness and conquer the fear within ourselves can we see the fullest truths of it clearly. It is only then through fortitude and courage that we can honestly know ourselves.n Who am I? n Where did I come from? n Why am I here? n Why have I suffered? n Where am I going? HermesThe personal answers to these questions can only be answered when the spirit, soul, mental, emotional, and physical bodies reach enlightened alignment (reunion) in order for one to coincide, know, and understand the other.

The fall from consciousness, the state of highest vibration, to unconscious, the dark ocean of unconsciousness, has been the source of human pain and fear for eons. The veil that covers our emotions and memory of the fall from consciousness (light) remains tightly in place as an act of grace. But, although veiled, the battles rage behind the veil of unconsciousness and periodically we get a glimpse of the nature of our true inner being. What is the battle?“Long, long ago in the days of the first man, warfare began between darkness and light. Men, then as now, were filled with darkness and light, and while some in darkness held sway, in others light filled the soul. Aye, age old is this warfare, the eternal struggle between darkness and light. Fiercely it is fought through all the ages using strange powers hidden to man... Adepts there have been filled with the blackness, struggling always against the light; but others there are who, filled with brightness have ever conquered the darkness of night...” Translation by Doreal, The Emerald Tablets of Thoth-the-Atlantean Too frightening to directly confront without a level of spiritual growth and intense self awareness, throughout life we encounter the warring force between darkness and light as it strikes out in our dreams and in strange phenomena we often refer to as miracles and such. However, there are no true miracles, only the revelatory alchemy of structured force within the universe. The truest miracle is that humans, oppressed with afflictions within all layers of being, are able at all to see beyond the veil of the depths of consciousness. This veil is not lowered until growth in the various bodies (spirit, mental, emotional, and physical) is achieved and the soul is ready to confront the layers of multidimensionality in fullness, self, forcing the balancing of the polarities, meeting without delay the Battle of the Shadows, and recollecting the fragments of the self. What are the Shadows and from where do they come? “Unseen they come and unseen they go, Man in his ignorance calls them from down below... ...Dark with a darkness not of the night, traveling over the Earth they walk through man’s dreams. Power they have gained from the darkness around them to call other dwellers from out of their plane in ways that are dark and unseen by man... Into man’s MIND-SPACE reach the Dark Brothers. Around it they close the veil of their night... ...Silently and secretly they bind and use the soul... ...Hark ye, O man and list to my warning: Be ye free from the bondage of night.

This co-creative process is assisted by both the higher vibrational forces (sons of light) and the lower, dense energies (sons of darkness). The forces of darkness, grave energies that become tangible, give life and the essence of highly charged energy to shadow forms that dwell within the ethereal planes of the collective unconsciousness, intricately attached to their human creators. These very real, life-filled, active shadow forms begin as deep crevasses within the individual mind, wedged and hone into place by suppressed emotions: hurts, pain, trauma, jealousy, desires, fears, and fervor that are often buried beneath the surface securely trapped within the emotional body. Sometimes emotions are buried so deeply and attached so strongly to an individual, especially in the case of severe abuse or trauma, that being well-integrated within the depths of the mind, the human co-creator of the shadow is seldom consciously aware of its existence. The unconscious holds a perfect memory of all thoughts, feelings, and experiences of the past. This unconscious memory is emotionally based. Deepest emotions are deeply interwoven and embedded within unconscious memories.EmeraldTablets/Thothfile:///D|/Occultism,%20Hermetics,%20Alchemy%...t%206%20The%20Battle%20of%20the%20Shadows.htm (4 of 9) [7/25/03 10:50:36 PM]"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"Rise To Consciousness Part 6The human mind is highly intelligent and in most humans struggles to maintain control of the individual life, although influenced by many powerful forces both seen and unseen. Often when the ego or well-being of the individual mind is highly threatened, an intelligent force that some psychologists call amnesia sets in. This memory/emotional suppression occurs often during tragic cases of abuse or intense fear and shock that threatens the well-being of a person and sometimes their very existence. The mind triggers the response to block a certain area of memory/emotion experience, often completely and quite competently burying large parts of the inner video, sometimes entire segments of the human’s life. It is in this manner that the abused one can continue living as if nothing has happened, and thereby avoid the emotional trauma that might otherwise cause collapse of the life structures. In doing so, shadowy forms are created, taking energy from the lower, dense, vibrational energies (sons of darkness of the unconscious realm) that cause severe blockages at many levels in the multidimensional body.

That is, the deepest shadow force often subconsciously directs action that leads to the creation of the next trauma and thereby the next layer of the shadowy underworld attachment of the human is conditioned. With enough force and with the often unseen influence of the lower, dense, vibrational energies (sons of darkness), massive energies are entrapped in the shadows of the unconscious sometimes growing into both interdimensional and terrestrial demonic forces that plague the human throughout the course of many lives. The negative energies of the universe are attracted to these shadows and often reddened legions grow and find nurture within the seething, vibrational undercurrent of embedded emotions within the collective unconsciousness. The shadows take tangible form and the soul, in a massive struggle for independent survival, becomes actively involved in the battle of the sons of light versus the sons of darkness. A battle is waged for the soul and it is our ability to rise to consciousness within the Battle of the Shadows that determines the victor.Seeking expressive life and existence and thriving on the multidimensional body of the human, these dark, shadowy forces attempt to dominate and control, often attaching to the soul causing dark horrors, fear, and pain, often unknown on a conscious level. These forces influence and direct many of the actions of the individual, and many weaker minds are led to atrocious acts against others by falling prey to such ill and convoluted influence. Many cases of insanity occur as the human is taken deeper and deeper into the clutches and realms of the shadows with no immediate hope for return. Many temporary avenues are approached subject to these forces before the individual can lower the veil enough to see the perpetrators and make a free will choice concerning the victor and the defeated. These shadowy forces also bring sickness and plague to human life, striking ferociously the physical, mental, and spiritual body from the entrapped levels of the emotional body. When the Christed One healed others, he stated to them that their sins were forgiven, and often cast out demons that were causing illness within humans.

This process always includes a total memory recollection of the suppressed fragments of the emotional body.The individual who seeks freedom from the depths and boundaries of the shadowy world of the unconscious, which is so intricately a part of our deepest being, must boldly stand with great fortitude, ever seeking self truth with a self chosen opening for the assistance of higher vibrational divine forces.

How do we best participate?“When unto thee comes a feeling drawing thee nearer to the dark gate, examine thine heart and find if the feeling thou hast cometh from within. If thou shalt find the darkness thine own thoughts, banish them forth from place in thy mind.

As the binary poles sway and unconscious (darkness) and conscious (light) energies surge, we often see this as a battle between angels and demons for the soul of the human. The human entity, an active participant, often falls quite gaunt in utmost fear and shocked horror, realizing individual impotence at some of his or her own depths during the processes that reveal the depths and heights of multidimensional levels of being. This occurs throughout life whether or not one is consciously aware of the process. The duress of the battle is felt within each of the bodies, even revealed at all levels, often with much unexplainable phenomena. The emotional body, intricately linked to the memory of all experiences of the soul, often brings the greatest suffrage in turn affecting the mental, physical, and spiritual well being. To become a master of emotion, one must process and balance emotion without storing it. This may well be one of the highest human challenges. Both faith and logic exist to support and endorse the other, and it is at this time that the serious minded spiritual alchemist must reach strongly out both in utmost faith and well-grounded logic.

At this ground zero point, the person is open to a new attitude, according to Jung, that accepts the “irrational and incomprehensible simply because it is happening.” At this point, the shift in consciousness is fertilized, and the flame of the soul is sparked to a higher level. The sleeping dragon awakens.Humans are many faced, multidimensional beings whose outer flesh houses the inner substance. In the world of physics this would best be explained as the vacuum contained within matter. The flesh, in dense frequency tends to confine and trap the inner body until it is realized that there is a dualistic contrast - a struggle occurring between the inner and outer nature. \"The inner bodies are the electrical and magnetic matter (the light body) connecting the flesh body with the breath form. These inner bodies transfer impressions from the flesh body to the breath form via the nerves.\" [Percival, Harold Waldwin. Thinking and Destiny Being the Science of Man, The World Foundation, Inc., Dallas, Texas, 1946.] When one is able to reconcile and balance these inner bodies with the outer, they have advanced toward understanding their true nature. The Hui Ming Ching states:“If thou wouldst complete the diamond body with no outflowing,Diligently heat the roots of consciousness and life.Kindle light in the blessed country ever close at hand,And there hidden, let thy true self always dwell.”While not an attempt to entirely encompass the realm of psychology and human behavior, understanding what is referred to here as the “Battle of the Shadows,” how and why it is waged and how to do battle therein, can help one understand that spiritual battles involve a balancing of the forces (dark and light) that permeate our being. Dr. C.G. Jung says that “the beginning, where everything is still one, and which therefore appears as the highest goal, lies at the bottom of the sea, in the darkness of the unconscious.” Human nature and consciousness are best expressed in terms of light. Thus, the darkness (unconsciousness) gives birth to the light (consciousness). The great, adverse Battle of the Shadows is a necessary process in the evolution of the human soul. Endowed with the diamond body (spirit) the roots of consciousness of pure life is kindled leading us to “the blessed country ever close at hand” - the state of reunion with the Divine. file:///D|/Occultism,%20Hermetics,%20Alchemy%...t%206%20The%20Battle%20of%20the%20Shadows.htm (8 of 9) [7/25/03 10:50:36 PM]"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"Rise To Consciousness Part 6 Carl Gustav JungThis material is copyright protected. © 2001 All rights reserved.

Driven by the same, the condition of the human mind is such that it ill accepts total annihilation, instead autonomously seeks immortality in one form or another, as well as punishment or reward for its deeds...”-Author What is it in within human existence that keeps one pondering the heights and depths of Heaven and Hell? The personal Ego struggles for survival in a mass of chaos with the balance consisting of Heaven or Hell. Deep within the psyche, and driven from the lowest valleys to the highest peaks of the thinking mind is the gnosis of immortality and since it exists, how one might best dwell within eternal life. There are few thinking humans who have not pondered at one time or another the existence of the Divine, the processes of life and death, and the existence of Heaven and Hell. Regardless of personal conclusion, belief, or knowledge, throughout the known history of mankind interwoven threads and particles of consciousness have inspired humans to ponder their origin, the meaning of human existence, and the future of the life force.The subject of Heaven and Hell has never lessened in intensity throughout the myriad of the long past and existing sciences, doctrines, and philosophies. Whether or not a particular mode of thought adheres to the discussion of immortality, it must always ponder origin, which includes the long debated argument between creation and evolution, and inevitably the discussion of the purpose and future of life in all of its forms. This hotly debated controversy is a moot point, because it becomes obvious to the thinking mind that there is a force that directs both creation and evolution - and that force is the Divine, the Sum Alpha and the Sum Finis, without beginning or end.Heaven and Hell can be described using many approaches and many idealisms. Heaven can be as simple as the ultimate and evolutionary survival of life species, and hell the death or extinction of such. It is only when pondering the Divine and how it affects life spiritually that different equations are added to the solution of Heaven and Hell. The contrast of Heaven and Hell can be symbolized by light (consciousness) and darkness (unconsciousness). Our individual participation in this contrast consists of the Rise to Consciousness, obtaining union/reunion with the Divine. The human evolutionary course of this emotional, spiritual, physical, and mental trek is life. The soul, driven by the binary forces of light (consciousness) and darkness (unconsciousness), is united with the spirit in its quest to keep us in freedom during our sojourn through the cosmos. According to Emanuel Swedenborg, a noted spiritual visionary, “The reason we are united in spirit to both Heaven and Hell is to keep us in freedom.” file:///D|/Occultism,%20Hermetics,%20Alchemy%2...ciousness%20Part%207%20Heaven%20and%20Hell.htm (1 of 6) [7/25/03 10:50:44 PM]"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"Rise To ConsciousnessThe multidimensional human is part and particle of the cosmic ocean from which it hails. The constantly shifting, atomic forces of the universe transmute through what we call “death”, transforming and transposing structures throughout the cosmos. Cosmic transmutation not only processes through death, but is also an incessant transformation throughout life with homo sapiens replacing nearly every cell in its form in repetitive cycles of seven years. The dust of a distant star in time becomes a constituent in the human body. Death, as we know it, does not exist, as all material bodies transmute and return to base form for use in some other measure of evolutionary creation. What we have come to understand as death is a mere casting away of outer garments, through which they are purged, shed, and cosmically laundered for reuse. Considering the shifting, temporal material life form, it becomes necessary to ponder the outward and inward bodies as they interrelate, for it is through a harmony of balancing such that the soul survives the alchemy of death.It is usually always the inner life form that is presupposed with the pondering of Heaven and Hell and what it means to the overall well-being and unity of the multidimensional body. In one sense, it should be the goal of human intention to bridge Heaven and Hell by the enlightened, conscious mind that interweaves the two. In order to do so, the material life form must serve as a temple or dwelling for the inner bodies. It becomes critically important to well care for the temple, and at the same time focus on the inner rise to consciousness. The goal is not to deny the flesh form, but to properly transcend it. This is evidenced in ancient biblical texts by the rise of Moses and Elijah in the flesh, and the transcendence and transmutation of the fleshly form by Jesus Christ. The ancient, lost art of undying through the personal Rise to Consciousness becomes paramount in our discussion and understanding of both Heaven and Hell.The vision of Heaven can be likened unto illumined, concentric circles of white light with the inner core radiating at the highest frequency. As the circles radiate outwards, the light, or frequency, lessens in degree. The vision of Hell might be identified as the denser frequencies, spiraling in downward masses in the darkest, abysmal oceans of the cosmos. The art of undying involves a concerted effort throughout temporal life to understand and reach that state known as Heaven, a rise to consciousness (light). The soul, having gone through the many stages and transformations of death, is drawn into the realms of consciousness (light) in which its frequency easily adapts. At the time of transmutation through death, the soul, endowed with consciously enlightened spirit, must be able to survive the intense journey through the cosmic realms to that existence known as Heaven, reuniting with the Divine. Simply speaking, to reach Heaven our inner essence must acutely vibrate at a high enough frequency to be able to dwell within the realms of light. Hell, the eternal abode of the unconscious mind, is reserved for the souls who have not achieved enough measure of consciousness (light) to survive within the file:///D|/Occultism,%20Hermetics,%20Alchemy%2...ciousness%20Part%207%20Heaven%20and%20Hell.htm (2 of 6) [7/25/03 10:50:44 PM]"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"Rise To Consciousnessconcentric circles of Heaven.Although this vision of Heaven and Hell serves as an ethereal analogy to help one relate to the inner realms of consciousness (light) and unconsciousness (darkness), the more earthly measures of Heaven and Hell can be readily evidenced in daily life. On Earth, the material realm that allows mankind to link Heaven and Hell, the multidimensional human body serves as a bridge. It is in this third dimensional realm, bound by the fourth dimension of time, that the human body serves as a temple for reuniting the higher dimensional bodies. To sin, or to fall short of the mark, is to temporarily lack the characteristics necessary for maintaining the evolution of consciousness (light). The human soul dwells in a realm of highest contrast, implicitly designed to further its conscious growth. Torn between the in-depth blends of consciousness/unconsciousness (light/darkness) the soul desperately seeks to maintain unity and further unite itSELF within the multidimensional realms. That arduous, fiercely passionate, ever-challenging struggle itself is the catalyst that separates homo sapiens from the animal kingdom, and furthers one along the path of consciousness (light).Let there be no misunderstanding about the high and profound challenges of the soul on the path that leads to Heaven and Hell. Deep within the realms of Hell lies Power untold which is often embodied and made blatantly manifest within our realm. Dwelling within the depths of unconsciousness (darkness) the shadowy Sons of Darkness, intimately attached within our multidimensional bodies, rise in desperate struggles for life and consciousness, battling fiercely the Sons of Light who masterfully, powerfully, and incessantly wage from the higher dimensions. The mind of the human becomes a virtual battleground between Heaven and Hell, often leaving the human aspect of even the hierophant quite gaunt. The enlightened spirit on the path of consciousness quickly learns to fortify itself within the realms of light, calling on the unyielding forces to anchor and protect the soul. Personal religion directs one to seek fortitude and strength, and during this session whether prayer, ritual, or silent contemplation, the soul through free will yields and is responsive to the waves of consciousness (light) from on high that shields and alters the forces that surround it. The response from on high is seen in the multifarious language of religion as guardian angels, light force, Sons of Light, the shield and armor of the Lord, and many other relative analogies. The importance of this yielding is to evolve the soul upward within the spiraling dimensions of light to closer reunion with the Divine. If one falls within the downward spiral of the unconscious world of darkness, the actions of the individual within the emotional, spiritual, physical, and mental bodies will become subject to the ill influences of the realm of unconsciousness (darkness). If not altered, this state of being opens a broad path for the embodiment of the Sons of Darkness which use the life force, with little care or regard for the personal well being of the spirit, and eventually casting the defused soul within the shadowy realms of Hell.file:///D|/Occultism,%20Hermetics,%20Alchemy%2...ciousness%20Part%207%20Heaven%20and%20Hell.htm (3 of 6) [7/25/03 10:50:45 PM]"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"Rise To ConsciousnessIn this vast and long enduring battle between Heaven and Hell, the balancing of consciousness (light) and unconsciousness (darkness) becomes critical. In an ideal individual battle, it is the knowledge and understanding of the Great Adversary, the embodiment of the unconscious realm of the dark shadows, that aids in the climb toward consciousness. This Great Adversary, while incessantly ferocious and hellishly monstrous, always serves a cause that points one toward Heaven. This Adversary appears in whatever form is necessary to facilitate the desired effect in the human, and often deceives the neophyte whom has not learned to rely upon the inner facilities of intuitive discernment. The Great Adversary, in one form or another, may appear over and over again, until the aspirant grasps the knowledge of how to free itself from the grips of horror by calling upon the Sons of Light for shielding and assistance. It is at this cusp of failure that the Rise to Consciousness is fertilized and the soul gathers fortitude and strength for it elevation to the next stage of awareness.In keeping with the thought of constant growth and evolution, then how does a soul become captured within the realms of Hell? In its current status, until the soul has mastered the art of undying, having met its reunion with the Divine wherein the struggle is no longer required, it must survive the various stages of death, which culminates as the massive scale of balance for the wheel of life. If within the course of a lifetime, the unrepentant and totally remorseless soul has completely succumbed to the denser frequencies, completely embodying itself in the vices of darkness, the scale is tipped and the soul plummets downward into the spiraling depths of darkness - meeting its own kind within the concentric realms and depths of Hell. If a mere spark of consciousness survives the balancing scales of the stages of death, the ethereal fires purge the dross of the soul into the realms of unconsciousness (darkness) and the remainder gravitates toward frequencies of its own kind within the concentric realms of Heaven.When pondering the process of Heaven and Hell in the descriptive analogy above, the next factor to consider would be whether or not the soul reincarnates, taking another life form in its evolution. In common discussion of reincarnation, humans often mistake the purpose and intent. The multiple incarnation of the soul of the human is not constant. It is not feasible to conclude that a maniacal soul completely captured within the realms of Hell, some so unyielding and demonically vile as to risk total annihilation, would be allowed opportunity to again live in human form in this universal life cycle in which our planet is currently involved. They are, at best, held within the grips of immortal Hell until such time as the Divine alters the course of current evolution. They do, at best, often serve multiple purposes. Because of their psychical and past worldly connections to individual humans, they sometimes serve the hellish and often painful purpose of balancing cause and effect. They also serve as examples to the human race of the consequences of file:///D|/Occultism,%20Hermetics,%20Alchemy%2...ciousness%20Part%207%20Heaven%20and%20Hell.htm (4 of 6) [7/25/03 10:50:45 PM]"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"Rise To Consciousnessexecuting free will toward unrepentant vice. On the other hand, if so much as a spark of consciousness (light) remains after passing the great balancing during the stages of death, the enlightened soul, for various Divine purposes, can be afforded the opportunity to take on additional life forms until the enlightened point of evolution in the Rise to Consciousness is reached, alleviating the necessity for further human sojourns. This does not always have to occur, but is a decision made by the soul, allowed by the Divine, to achieve further growth. In addition, there are instances where a soul, highly endowed with the spirit of consciousness (light), chooses to return to life as part of the Divine plan in order to assist in the development and education of mankind toward higher consciousness (light). The difference between these two orders of incarnating souls is that the first mentioned soul primarily returns for the balancing of cause and effect, the mastering of a lesson unlearned, or the correction of actions rendered upon another. The second, highly endowed with the spirit of consciousness (light), returns without the necessity of cause and effect, but to further serve the evolution of mankind through the Divine. In addition, when considering multiple incarnations and case studies of the same, one must bring to mind the purpose for which an individual begins to identify and recall the ancient history of the soul. This natural, evolutionary recollection of memory often begins with small fragments and identifications within the life span of an individual, and is always for the purpose of the advancement of knowledge in the unification of the soul, as well as for better understanding of what remains to be achieved. This recollection of ancient memory comes in gradual stages and in the ultimate Battle of the Shadows is brought to full light within the mind of the individual so that the purpose of the battle is acknowledged and the goal well understood. Within the Battle of the Shadows , the evolving mind recollects personal fragments and portions of the unconscious mind from the deep ocean of the collective unconsciousness, a vast storehouse of perfect memory, thoughts, and imbalanced emotional energies. The personal fragments of memory and emotion surviving within the collective unconsciousness over many life times can be quite massive, even overwhelming within the process of sublimation. The well grounded alchemist must strive to maintain a sense of identity with the soul while reviewing even the most grieving moments of the past within the rise to consciousness and reunion with the Divine. The intent and goal of the truest battle of the soul must be acknowledged, encountered, and acted upon without fail. This is most diligently achieved through logic, which sorts out the issues at hand, and ultimately faith that endeavors the individual ever forward and assures of its success.Heaven is never some far off, distant place in the universe that good souls may through grace be allowed entrance.

The magnanimous, billowing blast produced an upward tunnel that rose high into the heavens and blossomed out into billowing white clouds in the fantastical shape of a large mushroom. The cloud transmuted and flattened somewhat forming a massive wingspan that was the length, breadth, and height of the cloud within the whitened, illumined cloud burst. The profoundly illumined head of a brilliant being shined like billions of nuclear bursts, then formed into one massive glow too boldly brilliant to look upon, and the lower upflowing tunnel of the cloud transmuted into the whitened robes of the Christed One. In large, white, illuminated letters above the profoundly illumined head that shone as the sun appeared the words,“And everyone great and small upon the earth shall behold his face...”As the cloud burst and the mammoth shape of the Christed One appeared within the form, many billions of people of the Earth stared toward the heavens, their heads combining to create a mirage of the dark brown, blended, chaotic mass that covered the entire planet.A gargantuan, seething Leviathan-like Serpent of immense poise and exquisite, sensual beauty arose within view to the left from within the depths of stark darkness - a darkness so deep and still as to make one silent and frozen. The slowly writhing, manically leering creature was an elegant, emerald green with black diamond patterns and I watched in silent awe as it undulated through and from the depths of the deep, rising as if to stand tall in the full vista of my vision.One with, yet somehow apart from the vision, I beheld the Christed One who pointed to the upflowing tunnel that was the whitened robe and boomed in a thunderous voice,“None to the Father except through me!”The Christed One then arose from the billowing cloud and sat atop it in a stately manner on a lustrous throne of the whitest, glowing alabaster, with arms resting on the sides. This was an elegant, gracious, but fearsome entity that was at the same time in and of the entire blended permutation that was the event itself. Its face shone as some brilliant super novae and the people of the Earth trembled and being transfixed, all were quite unable to detach themselves from the sight.Alex Greyfile:///D|/Occultism,%20Hermetics,%20Alchemy%2...ness%20Part%2010%20A%20Seven-Fold%20Vision.htm (2 of 5) [7/25/03 10:50:52 PM]"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"A Seven-Fold VisionThe heavens separated and the huge, life-filled, Leviathan-like Serpent continued undulating slowly through the velveteen darkness - a stillness so deep as to render even myself dazed.

The Axis Pole then quickly shifted, leaning sharply to the left toward the giant Serpent, and I moved further back to behold all simultaneously within the field of vision. As the Axis Pole shifted, the Earth stopped its rapid revolution and awesomely reversed its trek, first slowly, then rapidly, expeditiously spinning counterclockwise until at last slowing to a somewhat normal pace.I once again beheld the many peoples of the Earth, who in wretched and frightened mass gazed continuously upward. Within the field of view the Archangel Michael made entrance from the brilliant glow of the right and many inhabitants of the light force manifested themselves moving about within the heavens of light.

The Archangel Michael called forth each human, one at a time, to singly approach the high throne of the Christed One, which had become like unto a high throne of judgment. Some intensely elated ones were transformed and instantaneously joined the light forces to the right as sparkling stars within that flitted around in great joy. Others approached the throne of judgment and turned in fright to the Archangel Michael who cast a fierce and huge, fiery spear with a brightly glowing, ardent tip through the heart of the harshly judged soul. Raising his right arm high, and lifting the entity high above his head, with a mighty thrust, the Archangel Michael cast the ill-judged one into the glowing eyes of the Serpent, and the entire spread of the darkened body could be seen falling into the pitted flames that were the Serpent’s eyes.
