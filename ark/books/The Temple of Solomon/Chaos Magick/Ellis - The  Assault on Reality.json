[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":" 1The Marauder Underground Our primary activity is attacking what is commonly known as consensual reality, the dominant paradigm, the mundane world, whatever you want to call it. We cast spells, scribe sigils, summon spirits, and open gateways. Anything that can be done to influence reality towards our goal. We use chalk to tag buildings & sidewalks with sigils and goetic summonings. We conjure up spirits and set them loose, leaving in our wake freshly haunted sites. We infect the population with the power of chaos, and watch as random magick explodes into the lives of unsuspecting citizens. We are reality deviants in the truest sense of the word, as we pry open the eyes of a sleeping humanity to the terror and wonder of the worlds beyond. What you are about to read is a condensed presentation of the online forums, emails, and conversations that encompass the creation, implementation, and current state of Ellis and the underground. Much of the original online discussion that gave birth to what may or may not be this movement has been lost or deleted. As a result, this text begins in the middle, with the first recoverable post. This text edited to the best quality, though consider the source, given that being published was not the original goal. To summarize, this discussion began with a question posed about placing ads in newspapers with the text “Magick is Real” and what sorts of effects would occur. From this humble beginning you may or may not have before you the resulting revolution.

To do one better, we could go so far as to leave responses in various magical writing systems. Futhark and enochian, together at last. Nyspryll: How about a discordian ritual or some humorous magickal working near a high or middle school, not with black robes or anything but just to lighten up the atmosphere in a place that is actually like a prison/ free labor camp and to stimulate the curiosity of very bored people? Baphmetis: How about using chaosphere's? Peter Carroll has a good section in Liber Null & Psychonaut on them. Perhaps if a great number of them are chalked, spraypainted, molded from clay and left lying around in public, a ritual could be performed which could charge them all to make the manifestations of weird occurrences to happen that would challenge the consensus belief more likely. Just an idea. A chaosphere is a sphere with eight arrows pointing from it. It can be created as a 2D drawing or 3D model. It can also be charged. It's function, according to Carroll in Liber Null: \"It is a purposely created crack in the fabric of reality through which the stuff of Chaos enters our dimension.\" It can be ritually charged with lifeforce in whatever form you wish to supply it, and acts as a \"magic lamp\" which \"emitteth the brilliant darkness\" according to Carroll. I like what he writes at the end of this section, as it inspired me to consider this: \"The erection of operating Chaospheres at various points about the earth will tend to hasten the immanentization of the eschaton, the change of aeon.\" "},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":" 3Or we could just clog up the personal ads in our local newspaper with phrases like \"Magic Works!\" Silenced: 1. Maybe there is already a group at work on this very project. Just yesterday, after reading the posts here, I was walking home from work and saw that someone had used a pattern of a chaosphere to spray paint one in relief on the sidewalk. Now vandalism is bad of course, but damn it was cool to see! 2. Maybe someone could set up a free website (or we could use this thread), we could post stories & pics of our various activities as magical miscreants. Everybody uses an alias so as not to get anyone in trouble with the law. 3. I like the \"reality game\" thing in the previous post. Maybe we could do a sort of Fight Club thing, but instead of fisticuffs its magick, we contend via chalking, ads, statues in sewers, flier campaigns, making haunted places, etc. Urban exploration, magick, and a little streak of discordian mischief. 4. We could even get non-magick folks involved, a symbol of power is a symbol of power, with the right encouragement/wizard's trick, we could actually fool people into true magick, prankster style. Any thoughts? Post those Ads! Just call your local paper and ask if they offer free ads to private party customers, not all papers do, but alot are getting on the bandwagon industry wide. Alaudurel: An online log of occult experiments...could be nice, I'd be up for it. Are we talking about all doing the same sigil, or simply a mass of sigils that come to us?"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":" 4 Arjil: I think that perhaps we should have a \"Linking Sigil\" a simple sigil we use to link our works in this vein together, kinda like a spell header, and then we slap whatever else we've got around it. That way we would be working in conjunction, but also manage to maintain our autonomy and unique spellcasting style, making our overall effect more diverse and interesting. I think it could serve to create an entirely new ley line web, especially if we attached it to nodes (places of power) or especially weird places (haunted houses, abandoned asylums, spooky woods etc). A \"Linking Sigil\" would have to be something simple, so that you could scribe it quickly on whatever medium was at hand... it also would need to be something rather unique, that didn't have any previous occult significance tied to it so it didn't interfere with the spell... I'll think about that. Nyspryll: I like Arjil's idea, perhaps we could activate dormant ley nodes in public places and use a sigil as an energy pool for personal uses. Or we could create a servitor, however that's old and that plane is clogged up with people’s servitors anyway. How about posting our sigil in the classifieds, or using the energy we get from the newly activated node to open portals? Silenced: Ok, so we've got a Linking Sigil. I can build a website this weekend, anyone have a lead on a better free service than yahoo? Arjil: I'm feelin' somethin' good here...Mayhaps I'll attempt some recruitment around the web, see if we can get this thing kickin' on a large scale, that'd be cool huh? Ah, but who ever said we had to stick 'em where they'd be seen? The only point of the linking sigil is to form a magick net, all working to increase the levels of magick in the world, like a giant spell that evolves and grows each time we add to it till eventually. If you feel that you should Wizard's Trick it, and let the muggles *see and wonder* then cool, if you"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":" 5prefer to work your magicks in secret go for it. The linking sigil makes whatever magick you use it in conjunction with another piece of the puzzle. I believe I'm going to stick an L.S. with an adjoining chaosphere, perhaps throw in a rune or sigil of spiritual awakening to the underside of the new age/occult bookshelf in Barnes and noble. That should make a nice little addition. Alaudurel: Oh, I like the bookshop idea. Incidentally, all of my markings do have the linking sigil in place nearby, so I look forward to the eventual buildup of energy and the theoretic effects. This should be fun. Silenced: Anybody ever seen the Fallen? The one with the angel who travels from body to body by touch? Maybe one could set a \"magic do as you will\" sort of charge on someone, and program into the spell a \"self-replicating sub-routine\", so that the random magic charge would spread from person to person like a virus, dropping a little piece of empowered chaos into people's lives. The site for out little \"activity\" is going to be up by Sunday night. The address is http://marauderunderground.chaosmagic.com Lady Hydralisk: I'd like to leave little notes in books at the children's section in the library, write them in spidery handwriting on papyrus, with a little magic spell on them, maybe for adolescent books. I remember when I was about eight, digging through the library stacks looking for grimoires in memory of a past life. Maybe help out another soul in the process. Awakening_93: On the idea of magical symbol for shock value, I want to give an example that I hope we can take something from. At my school, it would seem a bunch of Wiccans got a similar idea. All over the school were chalked pentagrams with \"Wicca\" written underneath.

So if we are to do anything for the physical shock factor, it would have to be something that stands out. I like to write \"Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the law\" on my desk in maths, just to see if it is ever answered with a \"love is the law, love under will\". So far, it has not been. On the linking Sigil: I think it has gained a little potency already. I just wrote it on my notepad so that I would remember. I put my pencil down, and it zoomed across the edge of the desk in a strange direction, for about 30cm (1 foot) before being shot out towards the wall. How's that for bringing the forces of chaos into the world? I'm interested in getting this moving in Australia. I'll keep a stick of chalk on me, and tell a few friends. Tolrn: I've started tackling the northeast coast of the USA. This place could use some more oddity. Nyspryll: Should we make a sigil of fun to increase that aspect? Daeinwolf: I will be starting tonight at some of the local dives. I might not be able to walk a straight line...but I damn sure should be able to draw a few. Silenced: If anyone knows any building contractors, you could get them to let you draw sigils on the bottom side of each tile, thus creating entire floors of spellworking. Everfool: Just to say, I've got a sigil worked up, and can more or less remember how it looks from memory. All I need is a night in London and a marker pen! "},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":" 7Silenced: Here's what I mean by reality deviant. To illustrate what this child witnessed, I must describe how I appear physically, then it might make more sense why I felt it pertinent to mention my looks. Keep in mind while I tell the story that I am a white guy, wearing green cargo pants, hiking boots, a black t-shirt, and those little goth forearm sleeves (a guilty pleasure I admit). I also have an average size goatee and well kept dreadlocks that end at the small of my back. I've let my physique go to pot since the dayjob, but still have the look of latent physical prowess (muscles no longer bulge, but I’m no slouch).What I'm trying to say is that I don't look Normal or Safe, especially for a small city in Arkansas. (most of these folks are surprised at nose rings, much less a dreadlocked mage who gives off no hippie vibe whatsoever). Ok, not that I've painted the picture. I was walking home from work when I came upon a young boy playing swords with a small stick. His mother was rummaging inside her parked car and oblivious to my presence or her child's enthusiastic sword fight with who knows what. I happened to be carrying a plastic play sword with me at the time (leftovers from a St. Patricks day diorama the day before). I saw the lad and immediately charged up the sword with magical energy, filling the sword with power as I walked towards the kid. He finally noticed me striding towards him (this is the part where his eyes nearly bugged out of his head) with sword in hand. Without missing a beat, totally unnoticed by his mother, I knelt before him and presented him with the sword. I said \"try this sword, its magic, and its yours\". Wide eyed he dropped the stick and grasped the sword, the moment his fingers touched it I could see the spell go off. I walked away as he resumed his battle, the mother still unaware of my passing. Everfool: Well, lets hope that’s one less soul chained and crippled. Papercut: Hi, everybody. I ́m new to this forum, obviously, and I don ́t know squat about magick, so I apologize for any moronic questions. But isn’t the deal about sigils that you upload/activate them in (to) your unconscious and forget them?"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":" 8 Frotish-Mewn: That's one way to use them. There are many creative ways that don't need to be forgotten, or even charged by the mage who created them. Look around and you'll find out much more about the uses of sigils. You're only limited by your imagination. Everfool: Wednesday 31st March, I'm hitting London. If I can get my mitts on a marker pen, up goes my sigil, accompanied by the linking sigil. My sigil is the intent 'Break the chains' - intended to loosen up people's possibilities, and giving them actual freedom to avoid the same old mistakes. I'm going to attempt to link these to previously opened chaos-vortexes so that they have an ongoing power supply. Wish me luck comrades. Draggar: Recently I started putting Linking Sigil EVERYWHERE, on every flat, writeable surface: notebooks, mails, stickers, official exams... just everywhere, in various situations. Baphmetis: I like to play around with sequencers and music-making software alot. I'm no professional, but I play around with that sort of thing and I could do with a project like that. Did you mean simply sampling an incomprehensible mantra and playing it low volume within a track? or did you mean something a bit more complicated? I think William S. Burroughs used to do something similar. He used to make recordings and play them at very low volume in certain environments. I would expand on this but I cannot remember all of the details that well. It had nothing to do with music anyway. Just a pointless anecdote. Never mind. Hopefully someone else here knows what I'm on about. "},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":" 9 Everfool: You could possibly play it at low volume, for a subliminal effect. But what really interests me is the thought of, somehow, getting some mix played at a night-club. Imagine a bunch of drunken exhilarated people dancing to some fast beat, when in comes Enochian or Latin or something. Average person won't notice a thing, but those of us in the know will be aware that magick is coming into the public domain. Baphmetis: I was also thinking about sticking in a sampled mantra at low volume, because I swear that's being done already. Listen to Marilyn Manson's Antichrist Superstar album - there are tracks (I think Wormboy is one of them) where if you listen very closely you can hear his voice muttering something under the instruments. I'm considering listening to the secret track at the end just to see if I can pick out anything similar. Given the occult nature of that album, it wouldn't surprise me if that was put in for magical effect of some kind. I have also noticed something like this in a Type O Negative album. I'm not sure, but I can't really see this as being simply an interesting sound effect, as it is less prominent than even the bass. Anyone else notice this? Silenced: Assaulting conventional realty. Curb stomping the dominant paradigm. I just wanted to revitalize a big thread from before the forum got hacked some months past. There were alot of us posting ideas and stories about goetic tagging, linking sigils, haunting new places, etc. Just thought I would throw this out and see if any of those folks were still around.

Silenced: I live in a town where one can call in personal ads for free in the newspaper, so I've been running an ad daily saying \"Magick is Real! Reality is up for grabs.\" I don't know if anyone's reading it, but its been running for about a month now. The nice thing is that anytime I'm out wandering I can snatch people's discarded papers (especially in front of apartment complexes or places people have moved out of but not cancelled their subscriptions) and have instant ammo for a quick spell. Which is usually cut out the ad, slap a linking sigil on it, and stick it to some public structure with a little spit. Yeah it’s crude, but hey, it’s a great thing to do when there’s nothing better around. I'm also working on a little business card with some powerful quotes or phrases on them, or maybe a quick \"magick in 5 steps\" thing, still in the works (costs a little more than I am willing to spend just yet, since most folks will throw them away at first glance). I'm also reading up on memes, basically a social psychology/magical theory about the collective subconscious & the tangible manipulation of ideas. Kind of like using soci-chemical formulas for effecting change in reality. Glad to see we all kept the ball rolling. 8CS: where did this all come from? Dunno how it escaped my attention...anyways.gonna go check that site. There’s some big graffiti near a train station here that says \"embrace global consciousness: free energy is coming!!\" I’m working on some kind of 'train magick' theory. Bit obsessed with the buggers at the moment. Trains and bridges. Silenced: Train Magick eh? I like that. Sort of reminds me of those taggers in New York City who used to paint the cars at night when they were in the garage, then commuters the next day were faced with huge murals and messages as they went to work that morning. Then the transit authority would white wash everything, only to have it tagged again in a few days. There's always been something powerful about train stations, or underpasses, bridges, steam tunnels, abandoned urban structures, alleys, all of those"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":" 11places. Sometimes they are more than just messed up urban sprawl, sometimes I thin that they become repositories for the lost/hidden magic in the world. In-between places where energy pools, waiting for explorer mystics and street mages to discover and tap into. Maybe its just a flight of fantasy, but maybe I'm right too. So yeah, tell us all about train magick, seems right up our alley (pun intended). 8CS: Well there isn't much to tell right now, except that I too get the same kind of feeling you described above. I've not been too active with magical pursuits for a while, only recently making a conscious effort to open my eyes again... I read \"time out of joint\" by Phillip k dick and it described an \"abandoned urban structure\" which was sort of a last bastion of truth in an artificial world (without giving away the plot - read it!). Anyways this just clicked with me. Melted together with the concept of TAZ, which incidentally finally came in the mail around the same time... (Love it when these things all fall together.) And the ideas that I’ve had for using various aspect of hip hop culture to um. \"Assault conventional realty. Or Curb stomp the dominant paradigm.\" The trains in NY fall into that. Combine that idea with hip hops tendency to use repetitive drum patterns, symbols and logos, code words, chanting etc, even its own \"wand\" (mic). and I dunno. I got inspired. Rin Daemoko: This is positively delicious. I know precisely how I can begin to \"glitter bomb\" my community. I will simply have to decide on the \"how\" of this. I would love to get sheets of blank stickers and draw sigils on them, then attach them to bus shelters. I don't mean the kind of stickers that are easy to remove. I mean the kind that you need industrial-strength WD-40 to get rid of. There is also a large park with a lake that is inhabited by an identity-less being in the center of the city (more or less). I could drop various items into the water which may or may not be found years from now. I can leave my stickers on garbage cans, lamp posts, washrooms, etcetera. Most of this city's occultists feel that reality is most malleable in that park, so it would make sense to widen something that is already open, right?"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":" 12 Oryztufre: You can get 'blank stickers' from places that cater to industry (try your local office store).

But I'd be willing to shell out a few bucks fer some colored paper that I could print out and cut into pieces of 8...then randomly stick them under peoples wiper blades, mailboxes, news papers (buy one, place \"ads\" in the rest), etc. If you gimme a few of those phrases you (or others) would like to see, and maybe that 5 step program, I'll gladdly Glitter Bomb Cereal City.

Quick, easy, and guaranteed you'll never get a ticket for vandalism! Silenced: One could, if one were adept at conjuring thought form entities or able to summon outer entities from the astral/etheric, you could bind those entities to the sigil stickers or into talismans, and leave them in the target areas. Depending upon your skill level you could assign a specific task to the bound entity, or you could just leave them about, creating haunted areas as you go. Maybe a witch's ladder, a doll, or a talisman could be placed under buildings, hung in gardens, or placed under stadium seats or office cubicles, could be used to cast specific spells on the individuals in the immediate area. Slam them with dreams, graft random magick energies onto their auras (really liven up their day), or maybe just a spell to \"increase weirdness levels\" in the target area. Chalk is wonderful. About a month ago myself and a few like-minded individuals drew some huge veves on the sidewalk, graf tags glorifying Papa Legba and The Baron. Chalking is quick, easy, capable of really big tags, and stays around, but isn't going to get you thrown in jail. It also lets you do your work and get away with it (chalk fits in the"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":" 13pocket much easier than spray paint). Its not just about planting thoughts or questions in people's minds, but also changing the energy patterns of reality. Sometimes I think that the unseen spells that change the environment can be just as effective as blasting their minds with sigil graffiti. Its like we are boxers setting them up with a right jab of sigil tagging, then laying them out with the left hook of global spellcasting. Son of a Montage: I recommend getting your idea out there by signing up and posting it in the Magick section at www.disinfo.com Thousands of people will see it. Also, a good place for \"glitter bombs\" are your local police station and courthouse bathrooms. The mall is another good place.

If karmic backlash is the price I have to pay, my soul is ready. Forgive my ignorance, but what is TAZ? Though I agree, sigils set up to create grids that people walk through is perfect. We could put them at the doors to stores, all over college campuses, or even sneak them into churches or the Fed. Visceral/Spagyrical: Silenced, I first came across your site a while back and was very inspired by it. I've been spending a lot of time with mixing telepathic suggestion and day-to-day language. I've had great results so far. The best part is there's no sign of any magic being used. No sigils. No magical symbols. No words of power. Just day-to-day language. I really like the idea of projecting suggestions/hallucinations with phrases like \"Hey, how's it going?\" The results tend to be ridiculous because the target never understands what the hell is going on. I got the go ahead from peebrain over at psipog.net for an article on my method, but that's gonna take me some time since I'm currently balancing school with working full time and trying to cram in as much reading material as possible, not to mention finding time to practice every day.

An industrious occultist could possibly (unless my experiment later this weekend blows up in my face), summon up or form a psi-ball, and instead of using it to convey a spell, one could re-program it to deliver magically charged memes. Kind of a remote mindcontrol spell that lasts just long enough to deliver its meme payload, then the meme replicates on its own without needing magic. 8CS: I get the feeling this weekend could be fun. Thanks for clearing up the dot/chaosphere question. TAZ - is Hakim Bey’s book. That you linked to in the same post. Temporary Autonomous Zones. Perhaps its not a valid comparison.

Actually, the last time I had a serious conversation about this was a year and a half ago; here! So, yeah... Nice! Albany NY has it's share of Mystai running about with paintpens and such. The problem is, that most of us have been wrecking each other (Bitchcraft) instead of a common foe. Need I say it? Conventional \"Reality\"! It's the same old story: The Vodoun folk don't like Witches (NO ONE likes the shiny, happy, fluffy ones!). The Witches don't get along with the Thelemites who don't... Yeah...

I'm not saying that the Sleeping masses deserve a gentle wake up (Is there such a thing?) but, come on! Now, here's a question: If I were to add the Linking Sigil to a bunch of these spots, would it empower these nasty little Runes and thereby burn out each of their targets? Would I \"Clear the slate\" so to speak? I figure that everyone left standing would rather get to the task at hand instead of wasting so much time and energy on petty squabbles.

Silenced: I think that adding the Linking sigil to the pre-existing tags would really get things 'mixed up', but that's the whole point. Who knows what will happen? Maybe you would be able to use the network to fuel whatever spells are hanging on those tags and 'clean the slate' with a huge magical clusterfu*k. Or maybe our grid will overpower the spells tied to the tags and empower the tags to our own ends. Maybe both, but we win either way simply by stirring things up. So what if we spark some conflict? We aren't being irreverent or immature, we are just doing what we feel needs to be done, its ok for us to enjoy it. What kind of hollow existence would it be if we couldn't derive some pleasure & entertainment out of working within our spiritual path? Perhaps this idea could be expanded to include other, non-occult, tags. I'm not saying anybody go and get themselves splinched in a gang war. But think of it. Gang tags juiced up with the Linking sigil? What if that sparked a fire in some of the members affected by the spells hanging on the tag? Maybe the end result is a self-propagating meme/spell that leaves the limitations of the tag and begins to worm its way into street culture? What happens when magick wielding gang-bangers pop-up? Hobo cultures, street kids, graf artists, and the other groups are the ones that are going to be most affected by our actions, so they will be the first to show signs of our progress. Of course that's just a theory, being a part of street culture ourselves (to a varying degree since we are from all walks of life), this might be an interesting way to gauge our progress.

So yeah, maybe there are only about 9 folks posting on this forum, but all of the people we involve on a personal level who don't post here are still very much a part of what we are doing. I like not knowing how many total are involved. It keeps me sharp and aggressive because we just might be the only ones, but at the same time I have hope because of the possibility that there are others like us out there stepping up. Its all about ideas on a global level and actions of individuals on a local level. Wickerman: Is anyone doing this sort of thing in Toronto? I can get to Toronto easily enough, so I might start tagging random areas myself. "},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":" 19 Visceral/Spagyrical: I've got lots of alchemical tattoos, so I tend to attract a lot of staring. Sometimes, a person will stare so hard that they tap into a symbol or two and the effects are quite fascinating to watch. So I'm thinking about getting the linking sigil tattooed in an inconspicuous place as a way of empowering the rest of my tattoos. This way, the next time someone thinks too hard about my tattoos, they'll be linked. Nightshade: I'm relatively certain that this has gone beyond the few posting here. If not, it will... There are a lot of people seeking \"hidden\" knowledge. It seems that the numbers are increasing exponentially. Those people will probably take note of this symbol and get curious. Especially if they find it in all kinds of places and linked to other Sigils. Eventually, they'll figure it out. The very least we can hope for is that other like minded folk will begin painting their environment with their own symbolism. Yeah, there's a few Crossroads that I have to hit with this... A couple of Cathedrals... Malls, parks, billboards, bridges... But definitely Churches, Synagogues, mosques, Temples etc. Those, I'm gonna be as inconspicuous as possible with. Just harnessing a bit of all that FAITH! Alchemical tattoos? I bet those come in handy and WHOA... If you get this linking sigil tattooed to your flesh... You just gotta tell us the results! Seriously, as this whole thing progresses, you're likely to get an incredible rush. Or not. Who knows? Frotish Mewn: I've been putting out sigils for this for a few months now. I have access to blank stickers at my job, so I've been having some fun. What I find really amusing is that the sigils I put up are the only graffiti that haven't been removed. I have a couple in the bathroom stalls where I'm assured by the sounds I hear that gnosis is being reached. I modified the linking sigil so that it causes paranoia in the viewer. Just recently I found out that I can create printed stickers at work and I've been printing out random phrases and drawing the LS underneath. Here are the phrases so far: \"NOTHING IS TRUE; EVERYTHING IS PERMITTED\" (How could I pass on this?)"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":" 20\"MAKE FRIENDS WITH A MONSTER\" (A la Douglas Coupland) \"ASK ME HOW\" I figured that while people ponder them in confusion, they’d fire off the sigils. To add to my fun, we send out palettes of products from my job across the country (US) and internationally. A few sigils have found their way onto those palettes. And now a lady friend of mine is helping me to put up some of the stickers, especially in those places out of my reach (women's bathroom). The other day I got to wondering about the web being created by the LS's, and I'm curious to know if anyone has actively tapped into it. When I thought about this while looking at one of the sigils, I saw thin golden threads radiating out from it. What are the possibilities from this web we're creating? v/s: I like your idea for getting the LS tattooed. I'm curious about the effects of that. Wouldn't it link you into the web? I'm not really sure what that could result in, but it could be very powerful. Visceral/Spagyrical: Well, because of the tattoos, my body is basically a living, breathing alchemical text that I'm writing myself (I'm not even done with it, yet). The tattoos represent the first alchemical process I ever uncovered (I've got quite a few up my sleeve) and it's the most mystical one I've found in all my years as an alchemist. I should also point out that I got the tattoos to assist in alchemical practices, not as an accessory to my appearance. In fact, my tattoos don't fit well at all with the way I dress or present myself. Anyway, the idea that I could link that particular process to a wider audience intrigues me to no end. Like I said earlier, I often catch a lot of people staring at my tattoos as I walk toward them or past them. Even last night, I saw a guy staring at my tattoos for at least a good thirty seconds while I was working. He appeared to be entering some strange state when I finally dug my eyes into his head so hard he was forced to make eye contact with me. For some reason the thought \"you shouldn't stare so damn hard\" came to mind while I was watching him, so I decided to break the connection. "},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":" 21Now, as far as linking into \"the web\" goes, that's something I've always strived for as an alchemist. Projection is a huge thing in alchemy. (It's often treated with more emphasis by alchemists than magicians.) I'm sure the results will be different in that projection will be enhanced exponentially with respect to certain individuals (i.e., marauders such as yourself), but I'm not so sure anything else will change. Maybe it'll just enhance the mystical aspect of marauding among its practitioners. Who knows? Maybe once I get it done and make it an official chapter in my text, you'll notice a difference in the way you perceive the linking sigil. When I finally do get it done, I'll let you know. To be honest, I'm not really sure what the results will be, but I'd love to find out. Chitch: I had to sign up to say that this is a really intriguing idea. From browsing it seems like most folks here are in the US. I am in the north of the UK, and I have copied the sigil onto some stickers along with various slogans culled from Principia Chaotica and will start getting them out around my city. Have also given some to a colleague of mine with a passing interest in magic and asked her to do the same. One thing I am interested in. Is anyone actually checking for any discernable results that manifest in places where they have placed the sigils? If you have been placing them in various public places or at sites associated with specific organizations then it might be an idea to start checking your local press for any outbreaks of chaos and weirdness that might have occurred as a result? Silenced: The use of stickers is a great move. My experience with the LS web we are creating with the LS is tough for me to describe, but I'll give it a shot. I see it as a metaphor (make visualization easy and describing it easier). Sometimes I see it as a conglomeration of datastreams (like the Matrix for lack of a better example). One big open source program to which we add, modify, and extract code and processing power for our individual works. The more of us there uploading our \"lines of code\", the bigger it becomes. The collective magical power generated by the people involved in the LS web are the source for its \"processing power\". I agree with previous posts, I see the"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":" 22connections to the LS web in my linking sigils as tiny golden threads, in my mind's eye they are both the power conduit that feeds and is fed by the LS web aswell as the \"upload\" conduit for my individual spell that grows and further evolves the web as a whole. That, in so many words, is how I see the LS web. So getting a tattoo or scar of the linking sigil would allow a person to become a livewire, pouring their essence into the grid. So not only would the LS web gain a tremendous output boost, that person bearing the sigil upon their flesh would ( I think) have a much more intimate relationship with the web, and be able to draw upon its power much more easily than the rest of us. Also, given the connection, every spell cast by that person would leave echos throughout the web, again helping to make it grow, evolve, and \"mix it up\". Who knows what would happen in the long run, but it seems to me that further marauder activity and folks like v/s linking their living alchemical tat network to the grid, might provide the power to make the LS web a tangible paradigm capable of running up against consensual reality, but because of its chaotic nature, would not end up becoming an oppressive usurper after said struggle. Ok, enough for today, my fingers hurt. Visceral/Spagyrical: I linked a professor today, but he doesn't know that. Frotish Mewn: v/s, I knew your response would be well thought out. Well done! I think you are very well on the right track. I'm also into magickal tattoos and have a couple myself. Adding the LS is becoming a temptation. And please do start a thread about your tattoos and results. Azi Dahaka: Tagged at least 15 linking sigils by themselves (I lost count)...I also blatantly ripped off frotish mewn (sorry about that, but I couldn't resist) with several \"ask me how's\", with the linking sigil of course.

Also drawn on some of the cards MU so it give a bit more of an impression of being a business thing. Sitckers up, most places I go. got a roll of blank labels which I’ve working through. sometimes adding something else, sometimes just the LS. I plan to try 'tapping into it' in a few weeks when I have a gig on. See I’ve also been putting it on the back of some of the flyers for the show. Silenced: Let us know how the show goes. If we could get a band to start running with us....oh the possibilities. From being able to tag the hell out of everything while on tour, to influencing reality with their music, to maybe even the linking sigil hidden within the cases in which their albums are sold or integrated with the band's logo or something. I know someone is going to say that over exposure/commercialization might kill what we are doing, that we would somehow lose our potency if this whole idea became \"pop culture\", but I disagree. Pop Culture = The Masses The more wide spread, well known, and in the public's eye we make this, the more powerful everything we do becomes. Isn't global liberation through reality wide chaos at least a facet of what we're doing? If we win, I will gladly put down my weapons and live in peace. But that day may be a long time coming, or never happen at all. So in the mean time I say we force feed the world till it chokes. Just as an experiment, I'm going to put up a few blood tags. Throw up a few spells and link them with the L-sigil drawn in blood. Kind of a spin off of the tattoo idea, but less permanent. I'll probably hit a few hotspots on the railroad tracks, as there are alot of travelers who pass through there (interestingly enough more young folks since I've been working on the area). We'll see what happens."},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":" 24 8CS: Well the gig is hip hop, which as I ranted about before, has a lot of links to what we're doing, in my not so humble opinion. There is a possibility of using sigils on the album cover also. Its in the planning stages, and the lyrics, which is what I do, have a lot of cryptic references to reality breakdown etc. It was noted recently by my one other friend who knows about this sort of thing, that has been a 'weird vibe' round here as of late. Maybe it’s all coming together, or apart, as the case may be. Will keep you updated! Hiro Tsukasa: This idea intrigues me, I'm extremely new to magic, so I'm probably going to sound stupid, but do you have to put a spell with the LS when you put them out or can you just put out the LS and if so, what are the results? 8CS: You can just put out the LS, and if this is working at all, it will contribute to a worldwide network of confusion and chaos. Effectively making any spells that ARE connected to an LS alot more effective. Hiro Tsukasa: Ah, I see, so it's basically like networking a bunch of computers together combining all that power. Son of a Montage: Seriously, if you want this to spread like a virus take all your bills out of your wallets, purses, ass etc. and write the sigils on them.

Gotta be a fair bit of 'free gnosis' to suck up? Hiro Tsukasa: Heh, I got the crazy idea that the next time my band puts out some CD (we've put out two demo's so far) putting the LS in somewhere as artwork, we usually sell quite a few demos, last time up around 100 some. I live in Kentucky and I dunno if anyone else is putting the LS up around here. Silenced: Money. There are so many magical theories pertaining to it, more in number and complexity than this quick post could possibly encompass. But I was thinking about Son of a Montage's sigils on money tactic. People invest so much energy in currency, (currency being simply a physical manifestation of wealth energy), that there really IS a \"power of money\". Being magic users we have the power to manipulate that energy pattern. So if we put the linking sigil on money, there could be two benefits for us. #1- Linking sigil connects our spells to the grid, so whatever spells we hang on the money will grow the grid aswell as affect all who interact with the currency. #2- The linking sigil would funnel some of that magical energy from the currency and the transactions into our grid (effectively letting us hack into the wealth energy pattern for free energy/processing power). It’s so easy, just slap the sigil on the bill, or scribe the sigil & hang a spell, then send it into the world. And that website for tracking money can possibly help us monitor"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":" 26progress or, more importantly, re-connect with our money and refresh the potency of the spells upon them. Remote spellcasting. Strange Divine: I agree about the money. I've drawn the linking sigil on some dollars. I put the sigil inside the all seeing eye pyramid. I figure that since there is so much metaphysical speculation about why that symbol appears on the currency, I might as well tap into that. Plus, I see it as a symbol of control. And we are, in essence, trying to undermine control. I'm also going to make a chalk drawing of the sigil inside the walk-through tunnel that connects a parking lot across the street to my university campus. A lot of people walk through it every day. Not to mention people drive over it. It may also be interesting to somehow pass the sigil out with Halloween candy. My family often buys little Halloween baggies to put candy in, and gives those to trick-or-treaters. I could always inscribe the sigil on the bag. A Hell of a lot of excitement is generated on that night, particularly surrounding trick-or-treating. I think that energy of abandon and mystery is great. Plus, \"I believe the children are the future.\" They are the ones who will be shaping the world soon. It might as well be a magickal world they create. OHH! I'll carve the LS into a pumpkin! There are some great possibilities in putting up the LS in close proximity to mall Santas, too. Nightshade: I'm totally with printing on money! Particularly on $20 bills. They're very common and the denomination is such that the current owner is always aware of it's location. Some part of them is keeping track of their money. With the LS on it, I imagine that mental connection will be stronger: \"That's weird. I wonder what it means...\" and from there. Halloween candy, money, album jackets... These are some seriously kick-ass ideas! I really like the thought of placing the LS on the Great Seal on the dollar bill. I have a friend hitting spots all over. I hit a crossroad sign (Shaped like a big \"T\") in my favorite cemetery. Also I climbed a wooded hill next to that cemetery and found a blank"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":" 27piece of wood (Handy huh?) with which, I made a sign (LS plus a little personal additive) to place over a hollow tree trunk there.

The place is a wellspring of energy, of course it attracts all kinds! I have a feeling they'll leave the sign alone. Without meeting, everyone seems to have come to an agreement not to disturb anyone else's offerings, charms or any other experiments. Everywhere else around here, it's a freakin' nasty free-for all. Oh well... It's about to get a little nuttier 'round here! My buddy and I have decided to draw the sigil on a map of Albany. That's the path that we're going to take on a serious spree! Yeah... An uber-linking sigil; covering our entire city. I'm trying to refrain from a burst of maniacal laughter. I'm not sure that I can hold it back much further... I'm going to reserve it for when I've finished drawing on the money in my pocket. Laughter is such a great way to transfer energy! Wickerman: Hmm. For those who work in record stores, what about drawing a few LSs on stickers, and putting said stickers on sold items? You might have to put the stickers in places that aren't easily noticed... anyone want to give this a try? Oryztufre: I work in a water plant...if I wrote it on a pipe would it 'power the city' so to speak? Or ya think it'd have to be seen in order to work properly? Strange Diving: I lean both ways.

I had it in my pocket and was working waiting on him to get there and we were having a slow day so I went to bring the trash cans in. Got to the last one and the door somehow slipped from my hands and I tried to catch it but instead got my middle finger crushed in the door, I believe then it started bleeding under the nail, kinda weird and hurt, so I went back inside and messed with it a bit to make it not hurt so much. Around that time my friend shows up and I was starting to show him what the LS looked like and I started feeling bad sick and for some reason my vision was getting very fuzzy to where everything looked white and then I couldn't hear out of one ear. He instantly figured it was because of the LS, but I had my doubts because I had felt sick all day...the vision loss was weird but I'm sure it's happened to other people when they were sick. Still I was confused as to why I couldn't see anything so I ran into the back and told him to watch the store, I thought in the dark maybe I'd see better but I didn't. So I ran to the bathroom and stayed in there with the lights off for a long time and finally (after cold sweating really bad) I began to feel a lil better and I turned on the lights and my vision was fine again. When I came back out my friend had ripped up the paper with the LS on it....well that's my funny anecdote for today. He's still convinced that's what it was, like I said....I have my doubts, prolly a coincidence and also (I'm new to this stuff, so PLEASE correct me if I am wrong) don't you have to do something to activate a sigil? Nightshade: Hiro, I'm of the opinion that one has to charge a sigil for it to be active. Then again, after a symbol has entered a large portion of the mass consciousness, it may take on an innate power of it's own. Yesterday, my landlord gave me notice that he wants to rent my apartment to someone else. I have to move at the end of September. There have been no problems, up 'till now. This just came out of left field so to speak. At a glance, astrological portents show that people under the water signs may need to deal with a little extra crap for a time. Not that astrology holds that much sway over our lives, but I think that it may help by showing major TRENDS. I use it to help explore probabilities. I think it strange that you felt better at the time your co-worker tore up the sigil. Is everyone else experiencing some major wackiness (the Bull-$#!+ kind)? I'd hate"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":" 29to think that there's a line of seriously bad code in our \"web\". If that's the case, I guess we'll just have to modify it. I doubt this is the case though. Hiro Tsukasa: I'd just say it was a coincidence, or perhaps maybe the sigil was reacting to something in the area, the store has alot of negative energy around, at least it feels that way and being a worker there alot of people I notice come angry or upset alot. Nightshade: I just thought of something. Which, in my vacuous mind is quite the achievement! We are all acting as agents of change. Thus, we must be prepared for unstable and/or sucky situations. I've found that \"Reality\" doesn't like to be folded too hard. Whenever I've done something that one could construe as \"seriously impossible\", I've had to deal with some messed up consequences. Not all people affected by the LS are going to take it in a positive manner. Hazards of the game, I guess. Now, this could just be me, but I've noticed that the mundane, mouth-breathing, masses tend to recoil from catalysts for change. Most of us stand for things that the general populace fear; because the unknown is sinister to those who make better pets than people. Orytzufre: This LS is, in a way, being powered by all that see it, in turn it is powering all the things it is linked too. Under this technique would it be possible to power a global servitor? As in adding the LS + SS (Servitor Sigil) to various objects so that other people can help you to empower the little critter? By my thinking, it should raise it to godhead rather quickly. I'm not talking about Skavan here...I'm talking about making a new one. Possibly related somehow to the LS, or possibly created to further the advancement of Magick in general, that all of us could call upon, use, and befriend(?). On a side note, next week sometime you can expect the LS to be written on the 3 main pipes at the water plant, as well as at least 2 of the booster stations & one of the water towers.... Figured it might loose some power half way through the city so I'd give it a power-up in the same places that the water itself needs a boost."},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":" 30 Frotish Mewn: I've been carrying around LS's in my pocket, but in the last 2 weeks I started carrying more of them. Tuesday night at work I smashed my finger under a pallet. I didn't make any connection at the time, but other things have happened since then. The next night I was driving a Hi-lo (a motorized machine weighing between 3-4 tons with forklifts). I stopped it, and just as I was about to get off, it started to move again. The control stick had gotten stuck so that it was slowly turning. Last night I just had horrible luck with a Hi-lo in my last hour at work. I started feeling a little paranoid about it, but I'm still not sure what I think. If any of this has to do with the LS, I'd think that it isn't the LS itself, but maybe the other sigils linked through it. What about the \"psychic landmines\" that NightShade mentioned? Son of a Montage: I may or may not be experiencing things related to the LS. Hiro Tsukasa: Possibly the tactic here is to plant the LS rather than pack it around, as there may be some case that other sigils linked by an LS could work off of others. Nightshade: I've come to the decision NOT to add the LS to anyone else's sigils in my area. It occurred to me that adding it COULD have bad results (Being as those sigils are malicious in nature). It seems to me that the probability of some kind of backlash is MUCH too high. Any probability greater than zero becomes a certainty if you test it enough times. Even without pissing off Mystai in the middle of a \"Witch-War\", I've got enough problems! Correct me if I'm wrong but we all adopted the LS in the hope of \"shaking things up\" and advancing a paradigm that's more conducive to our Willworking. Perhaps we should all EXPECT the unexpected. We're sowing the seeds of Chaos; is it any wonder that Entropy would manifest more fully in our lives? "},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":" 31For now, I'm focusing on stability. I won't be doing anything in specific until I've made that uber-sigil over my region. It's my hope that the effects will settle into a \"normal\" pattern.

It's like we are adding threads to the \"Quilt\" of \"Reality\" and things could get frayed. I'm sure things will smooth over though. Eventually the LS and the Magicks we've all added to it will be assimilated into the \"Weave\". Until then, we may all have to deal with \"reality's\" natural defense system. Wow! An entire water supply! It's like making holy water. Hail Eris! Now the thought of a LS Universal Servitor intrigues me. There very well may be an egregore forming in association with it already. It would be an amalgamation of all our Willworking traits. That's pretty freakin' wild! Maybe we should all decide on a \"Name\" and set a date/time for a long-distance group Rite to breathe Life into it! Then again, maybe we should focus on the \"backbone\" of our \"web\" first. 8CS: My home town which may or may not be where I was on Friday night may or may not have experienced a drunken bout of stickering around its central business district. perhaps. I explained the logo to a friend that night also, expecting him to be like 'what the fark? That’s weird man' type dismissive. But no, my basic explanation of 'its about the 'breaking down of reality'' was greeted with a reply of 'yeah? cool.' This is good as he is also in the 'band'. funnily enough, the initials of which are LDD, which can also be seen in the LS sigil. !!*wow*!! So um, maybe its working its magic around here? I too got a finger injury! A week ago though. But it still hurts. just a 'sprained' or 'jarred' finger. This is all moving along well.. yes? Now a question: has anyone tried meditating on this sigil?

Then I was arrested about 15 minutes after that for disorderly (Hail Eris!!!) conduct, trespassing, and destruction of property. All in a drunken daze..."},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":" 32 Hiro Tsukasa: Maybe the LS just naturally elicits chaotic events, I wouldn't guess everywhere but maybe it depends on the energies in it's area, like I already mentioned the video store where I had the occurrence definitely has alot of negative energy about it. Chitch: My fingers are intact. However, I did my first major bombing with the Sigil on Friday night, having been carrying copies with me since last week. On Saturday my girlfriend missed her flight to Spain, my car broke down, and I managed to get locked out, was unable to contact the landlord, and eventually had to call out a locksmith to the tune of £140 (that is about $255 for our American members). How is that for a nice intrusion of chaos? Son of a Montage: Damn, you beat me!!! Chitch: If the LS is operating to create a kind of network for the absorption and redistribution of chaotic energies, then would it not be possible to feed a servitor into it that could roam the network like a virus in the net? It could be programmed to act as a kind of flow control, directing the energy for specific purposes, or just to help empower any other magic that draws from the network for its power. Frotish Mewn: I like the idea of an egrogore to help direct the flow of energy throughout the web (if that doesn't contradict the whole purpose), but I think we'd have to be careful in it's design. The web has been up and growing for a while now and any entity introduced would most likely grow very fast. The programming would have to be well thought out to avoid any problems with behavior. After all, would you want to release a monster into such a widespread network? The main reason I'm even into this idea is to"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":" 33lessen the amount of negative activity from the web. Maybe it's best if we do some active exploration along the web to get a better feel of what's going on. Another reason I'd have for an egregore is to prevent people from tapping into the web with destructive intent. I'd hate to tap into it myself and find out that someone has set traps, connected a vampiric servitor, or any such thing. Silenced: Reality can be bent only so far before it tries to spring back into place. More subtle magick of course does not risk this as much, but we are being consciously vulgar and reckless with our endeavors. We are putting unrelenting pressure on reality's boundaries, and as such we will, some of us, from time to time, have to suffer the backlash from this. (I myself have had an unnerving string of bad luck and an unexplained nosebleed, and from what I've read I got lucky.) Its a risk we take. If anything this is a sign that we are making a difference, even if small, if reality is biting back against those connected to the LS web. So in a kamikaze kind of way, this is a good thing. However, the bigger and more potent the LS web gets, the harder reality is going to hit back, and I for one don't want to die just yet. So we need a solution, here's my idea: A friend of mine recently gifted me with a dream catcher, he called it his \"Oh no you didn't!\" dream catcher. It is made with the usual web of knotted artificial sinew and crystals woven into the net. The web is spun upon a triangle made from honey locust (lots of really wicked thorns). While normal catchers absorb & store negative energy, this variant is a nasty \"return to sender\" sort of catcher, if you get my meaning. We create, as individuals, personal halos, locks, or shields, depending upon your personal visualization/terminology preference. Example: I visualize all of my spells & tags as connected/generating the LS web with little golden tendrils of energy, I too am connected to the grid by these tendrils. I create a nasty looking \"return to sender\" halo that is grafted to my aura/avatar/mage soul. When I"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":" 34activate the halo it becomes an \"input only\" device, thus no energy/spells from the LS web can reach me (though I can continue to feed it with my energy), they are stopped by the halo. If they are overt attacks, intruders to the grid, or reality backlashes, the halo protects me, and if necessary (like some punk ass trashing our grid or trying to corrupt us from within) hit back, hard. When I deactivate the halo I am naked to the grid, and can draw upon its power. Maybe by all of us using this halo/shield/lock method, we can continue to grow the grid yet remain at least a little safer from the backlash or other negative effects of the LS web. Then again, if chaos is what we dish out, it is inevitable that chaos will find its way back into our lives. As to servitors powered by the LS web, why not? I was thinking about the citywide sigils mentioned before. We could make cut outs of the LS sigil, or the LS sigil combined with a sigil of \"magick on the road\" or \"cast chaos spell on whomsoever passes over this sigil\". Then take the cut out on a road trip. At night (less cops & traffic), stop in the middle of the road, throw down the cut out and spray it with spray paint. Do it on both sides of the road, do it as often as possible, on all the roads you can. Then every time someone drives over it they get nailed with the spell. Whether they see it or not, it will get them. So many thousands of people a day depending upon how many roads get tagged. Oryztufre: Maybe on/under an overpass...as above, so below (if ya get my meaning). Strange Divine: I have had the linking sigil drawn on my left wrist for a while. On Saturday, I set up a LS on the skeleton of an old dead tree near my house. The tree has magickal significance for me, because when I was about 10 years old, I believed that the tree was originally from Salem MA, and had been magickally transferred to my property by the Horned God, whom I was really into at the time. It was all a part of a bizarre reincarnation scenerio that I am amazed now that I came up with at such a young age. I \"activated\" the sigil by imagining it lighting up in a blazing white outline, with ripples emanating from it, warping the space around it."},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":" 35 I also set up a LS on my altar, and focused on it during meditation. I also had the LS on my wrist when I attended a Catholic mass yesterday, which may have been gazed on by a priest while he administered communion to me. However, I woke at 12 this morning (the dawning of the 23rd, incidentally), violently dizzy and proceeded to vomit and experience other sordid symptoms for the remainder of the night. I won't go into further detail because I'm such a Victorian, but I felt compelled to \"deactivate\" my sigils for the time being. Though, my brother-in-law is having similar symptoms, and I think I heard that someone else I know is experiencing the same thing. Therefore, I suspect that this illness may be unrelated to the LS Network, but I can't be sure. A strange incident recently occurred in my town. During a lightning storm, a bolt of lightning hit near a large pond and instantly killed an entire group of ducks that were going for a swim. I have no idea if it is related, but it strikes me as odd. Again, we may be over-reacting and blaming unrelated occurrences on the Network, but perhaps we should take a precaution, and adopt the fluffy New Age tactic of \"directing positive energy\" into the system. Or something similar. Maybe trying to direct chaos is against our original aim, but I for one would like to see the project creating a more magickal world, rather than simply releasing random outbursts of unpleasantness. But maybe these problems are just temporary, and will settle somewhat as the Network becomes more established. Oryztufre: I'm holding off tagging the water supply till the network is a bit more stable...no point in making the 53,364 people that live in this faircity ill. Well...that & I seem to have lost my sharpie *shrug* If the network is becoming unstable then maybe an egregore really is in order...maybe a legion of them.

"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":" 368CS: I don't know about all this messing around with the network via egregore etc. Not yet. I believe this network is just warming up, I mean, these events aren't really what I would’ve thought were the kind of things we were trying to achieve. Seems like its just getting psyched up, before the real reality altering shit begins. I reckon let it slide a bit longer. Find its feet as it were. Something I would suggest, is to give the sigil more of an identity, so the thing itself may evolve into a servitor/egregore/whatever the hell... on its own, in its own time. Much like the earlier example of that Mr. Fortamecus fella. Thusly, I propose that instead of LS, we name the thing Ellis. \"eL - eSS.\" Gettit? Plus, its similar to Eris. Like the long lost cousin, or lovechild perhaps. This may calm it down a bit. Well calm isn’t the word. I really think its trying to 'find itself.' Ok that’s my 8.3 cents for now. Strange Divine: Ah, and it seems like only yesterday it was a mere idea, now it will probably go on a cross-country road trip of self-discovery, and will experiment with other like-minded individuals at university. Errrr, but yes, I agree. I think the egregore development should be more organic rather than unnecessarily forced. And I like the idea of giving it a name. It all sounds good to me. It seems that the tactic so far has been basically to plant the sigil all over the place with the intent of making it stronger, without giving much thought to what unforeseen forces it might be absorbing. Perhaps we should be focusing more on empowering it ourselves at this point and moulding it, before releasing it into the wide world. To use the child trying to find itself metaphor again, it seems that the web is associating with \"bad influences\" before it has gotten a chance to develop its own identity: therefore, it is being shaped by what ever it comes into contact with. In these early stages, it may be better for us to attach it to places of personal power for us, like a favorite outdoor ritual spot, instead of busy urban areas. This way, we can have a better idea of what is going in during this very formative period. After we have observed the development for a while, then we can really go for it and allow it to shake things up. "},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":" 37Silenced: 8CS, I like it. Who knows what will, or is happening with the grid. Maybe backlash is slamming us around, or maybe we are more apt to ascribe such recent events to the grid because of our interest, enthusiasm, and purpose. As I see it, we take a chance either way. Its like this chaosphere tag on a building I walk past twice a day on the way to work. Most of the time I just kiss my finger and touch/empower the symbol (put there by persons unknown). Yet, there are times when walking past it that I consciously throw up a shield, sometimes there is enough trouble in my life without being bathed in the energies of chaos. But I AM NOT going to shut off my sigils. Though in the future if I feel like reality or the grid is getting ready to slam me or is dumping more disorder and bad juju into my life than I can handle, I'll just throw up a shield long enough to catch a breather, then get back into the game. Strange Divine, I think we should do both. Keep absorbing/projecting the chaotic energies of urban areas and other random variables (for strength and evolution), and tie it to our personal places (for identity and purpose). Strange Divine: Good idea. I think tying it to personal places may help keep the system balanced and somewhat focused. I have a very strong feeling that something extremely important is happening with the grid right now. Is anyone else feeling this? Hiro Tsukasa: The whole grid thing and the LS has been crossing my mind a whole lot today than it has usually and I can't really say why. I've not created/planted/or activated any LS since my recent finger injury, I'm new to magick so I'm taking a break to learn some basic defensive spells before heading into another endeavor with them, I also agree on the personal places being used to balance out the system. I had 3 LS with me the day at the Video Store I work for when I got my finger smashed, I deactivated two and discarded them but I somehow lost the other one, as far as I know it's still in the store. Nothing weird has happened since then so I think things have balanced back out, if it was in fact the Sigil's doing.

Fatbastard: If I were you I would researched it a bit from sacred geometry before I would construct something like that, but that’s because I`m an anal alchemist :-p Seriously now, if you need to construct something that will behave as a network you must have a foundation to limit its structure and direct its growth, otherwise you'll end up with a big metaphysical tumor behaving like a 3 year old throwing tantrums all the time. Which in case it could be fun, after all this is the chaos magick forum eh? But anyway, I’m surprised, you don’t want Chaos, you want a specified sort of Chaos, which is order. You don’t want unpleasantness neither accidents. You want metaphysical amusement. Come on people, by principle Chaos dissolves things to make room so that things can be coagulated and recombined to something NEW. It is not evil \"negative\" energy, dissolution always hurts. It is Eris doing that, while Eros is responsible for coagulation and unity. Silenced: More or less I agree with fatbastard, though I see the grid as more of a mutagenic virus mass than a construct that can be controlled or an equation that can be balanced.

What you say is only partly true for myself. I don't mind some unpleasantness, but I guess I do want it to be more readily observable how it can lead to new things from which I may benefit. Then again, that is up to my perception of events. What current events have done for me besides make work even weirder and more hectic is still a mystery to me. Oh, and I just found out that I have a distal fracture. I broke the bone in the first digit of my finger. And still, I have no intentions in stopping my distribution of the LS, nor ending any exploration of the webs and its uses. Fatbastard: Keep it up then, people should not complain, that was my point initially. I've made a slight technical error. When I said that Chaos dissolves things I was wrong. When I speak for Chaos I refer to it as the alchemical Prima Materia, and Prima Materia does not dissolve things, it is the product of dissolution. So in alchemy, in order refine something you first need to reduce it back to Prima Materia by \"killing it\" so that the extracted essence gets coagulated and falls down to the dead matter in order to revive it. So in a way, your experiment works a bit like that, it reduces segments of your everyday routine life back into their Prima Materia (or is in the process of) so that a new understanding may arise. I need to apologize as I see it now. The \"unpleasantness\" and \"weirdness\" of this experiment is absolutely ESSENTIAL. It marks onset of the first alchemical stage, 'Nigredo'. My advice to you, is to continue at all cost. If you leave it in the middle, you will fail and need to start all over again. So, keep going and keep your 'heat' in moderation.

I guess that qualifies as hardcore magical terrorism, though I suppose at this point the laws of men do not apply. Hiro Tsukasa: I'm not complaining about my finger injury I had a slight feeling when I first read the posts about the LS under the forum for Chaos Magic I had a feeling that of course it's results would be chaotic. Now I'm starting to see there's kinda two beliefs as to what the LS is doing and that leaves me wondering a bit more than I already did. I started college today and during the time I took for lunch I sat bored at my table for awhile since I couldn't find my friends and played with this black marker I found on the floor, as I got up to leave I grabbed a napkin remaining at the table, drew the LS and below it wrote \"Tap Into Reality\" and left it sitting in the middle of the table, lol. Azi Dahaka: A few smashed fingers is just the price I'll have to pay. I’m going to borrow my mothers sticker making machine and mass produce the LS. I read on a website called Irreality (I think) that there were plans to make large banners with their logo on it and hang them on tall buildings all at the same time. I could probably manage a few large banners on some of my local abandoned buildings. Nightshade: Funny, the last post I did here kind of vanished... That was a couple of days ago (and would have been my 23rd post btw). Yet much of what I had said has been covered by everyone else!

Aren't we all? Now, I'm thinking on the Sigil with the \"Proper\" connectors... It seems that the sigil we've been working with has the effect of expansion and the other would of course, contract. I'm feeling a bit retarded today so bare with the oversimplifications please. This could be the \"flow control\" we have been wondering about for a little while now. Then again... Silenced had the idea of auric grafting with Ellis. Hmmm. What if some of the nastier effects of this experiment could be channeled toward another using the \"contractive\" version? This is obviously a vicious thing to do. Perhaps this idea could be applied toward institutions... Who knows? At this point, I'm sticking to tagging spots along the natural lines of force in my area.

Strange Divine: I've been thinking about that a lot, actually. I think we are all being psychically linked. We are using \"linking sigils,\" after all. It could be that we are creating a composite consciousness, with the minds of each individual it connects with acting as nodes, or neurons. In other words, something greater than the whole of its parts. Is anyone familiar with the \"third-mind\" theory? It was mainly pushed forward by William S. Burroughs and Brion Gysin, but they were certainly not the first to notice the phenomena. Anyway, they basically believed that no two minds can communicate with each other without first creating a \"third mind,\" a separate entity between them which acts as an intermediary. We could be heralding in a new age of human evolution by purposefully constructing a group third mind that is more powerful than any one individual.

Forgotten urban areas have always had an effect on me in some subconscious way. I have even considered a coffee table book of photography as a project, even though I'm no photographer. They stick in my memory from adolescence. I was prone to wander the neighborhood (not particularly urban but not so suburban either). These places were odd little things. Metal and rusty with bases of concrete, many out in fields or company lots. Some, small outdoor access places to runoff cisterns or pumps. I can see them, feel them, even now. Others were lonely forgotten places where I sat and dismantled the paradigms of my parents and peers, and fed my teenage angst with lusty thoughts of inaccessible women and girls. Places we'd gather to drink stolen beer and talk about how we weren't going to be our parents. Once or twice even with girls. Sometimes while driving with the family I'll see one, a 'new' one and mention to the wife, just vaguely, how I like those places. She gives me an odd look and changes the subject politely. I must find these places again or anew. When I do, I just might link them to this project, or maybe my own selfish uses first.

Though the Izabel phenomenon is a good example of what might happen, for better or worse, if we tried to impart too much personality to the grid. Still chewing on Izabel, but definitely thinking that much fun could be had, in addition to being a harbinger of chaos, if one built a sigil that incorporated the Izabel deity. Might that link the deity to the grid, making a \"god\" a part of Ellis in that same way that all of us are? If that were possible, why couldn't we just go around an wake up all of the old gods (like Baal, Ra, or Quetzoquatl) and hook them up to Ellis? Nightshade: I'm still painting Albany Magickal!

Its always easier to cast spells when one is in a \"magical\" place. Sometimes the magic isn't necessarily pleasant, but it is potent just the same. Or when a ceremonialist prepares a ritual space in which to perform complex ritual magic. Or something as subtle an unusual as a packet of sugar and a bic lighter in a seedy hotel room. Magick is much easier and more potent when practiced in areas of \"high magical resonance\". What we accomplish with tagging, in addition to Ellis, is a proliferation of locations with high resonance. Naturally, the more we do this and the more people helping us, the more widespread this becomes. There is potential for some serious change. If we focus more (though can't bring myself to stop sporadically casting & tagging wherever I am) on one area, we could change entire streets, districts, or even cities. Imagine if a bunch of hardcore magi tagged & cast every building, alley, and subway tunnel in New York City. Or the French Quarter in New Orleans. Or downtown Seattle or San Francisco. Those places already have a resonance, and it could easily be used to create \"magical cities\". The result of course being that the entire city would be a ritual space, and everyone would feel it, magick would be easier and more overt. In the same vein, we could juice up places or cities that don't already have a magical resonance. There should be no reason we can't do this the world over, its simply a matter of logistics & timing.

It may seem weak, but I'm not going to let you call me out on an internet forum. Besides, we all know what I mean when I say \"terrors & wonders of worlds beyond\", I can't say what it means for every individual, that's up to them, and that's the point. Anyone here have access to maps of the NYC subway system? We could use the maps to plot out a sigil, tag it, then post it on the site so that the rest of us could see it, use it, and empower it. I hope to go to NYC in the next few months (barring any financial woes), but someone already there (or more internet savvy than myself) could get those maps much easier and possibly get the tagging done. Anybody? 1000 Shades of Gray: That has already been done. The subway and the Manhattan tunnels were used to create a gigantic bind rune that affects not only the whole city but the whole country. Trying to create such a sigil, would awake the bindrune's defenses and send a world of pain your way. I suggest avoiding that type of work on New York, São Paulo, Paris. But, If you don't believe me do it any way. You can get the maps here http://www.nycsubway.org/maps/route/nysubway.pdf The São Paulo bindrune was created primarily to fight misery. There are 17.000.000 people living there and at least 17.000.000 more living in the slums ( The favelas ) that surround the city. There’s poverty, fear and an extremely high crime rate. If the bind rune is working as expected in the next 5 to 7 years we will see an enormous improvement in the life of those people. It is coded to blitz whatever could stop, harm or slow down that process. If it all goes well, several other similar bind runes will we placed in other cities in the world during the next 35 years. The Paris bindrune has to do with culture and the saving of documents and art.

The New York rune is composed of several other bind runes. I only know about a few of those, but the most important was made to control the Chaos that happens in New York ( and if you think that there isn’t much Chaos in there... Well, just ask some of the forum members that live there ) Arjil: Hullo, I felt the need to put my two bits in as the creator of the Linking Sigil concept and the sigil itself. You do, in a sense have a particular kind of point. Some of what people do with this new magick web we are creating isn't all that nice, however, some of it is. It balances itself out. The point of all this, from my perspective at any rate, is to increase the amount of Wonder in the world- to make people Believe in something again, and ultimately to reconnect the ley-line web which has been sorely damaged, reclaim lost sacred sites, and carve out new ones to empower the world with Possibility and imagination once more. It is my aim to bring the magick back, whether it ever was or not. The Mundane has held us under its sway for far too long, the Age of Reason did its job and it is time for the pendulum to swing back the other way. This is where my path has led. For my part, I use my influence and power to make peoples lives more interesting, providing a nice balance to silenced's more... gregarious approach. I'm all about waking up spirits and prodding the sleepy magicks of the world into wakefulness, but I tend toward a less malign aspect- and that's part of the point. Each person involved in this endeavor expands the overall effect with their own unique essence and imaginative input, some is naughty some nice, some just very very odd. One might ask just who I think I am to start such a thing?, How dare I espouse such arrogance, to think I know what the world needs? How dare I unleash such a thing? I dare because I've had enough. I've had to put up with the Mundane's shit for twenty eight years, trapped in a prison of Thou Shalt Not's, Do Not Enter's, and Back In Your Box Weirdo's, and frankly I'm not going to take it anymore. The world at large has Earned my Wizardly wrath, and I say let the wild rumpus start! "},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":" 53Nayld23: Yes Arjil, I am in agreement. I apologize for the above and probably read too much into the concept. Like I said, someone came to me with some problems with it and asked me to take a look. I don't find the idea, as a utopian de-construction, \"bad\" at all, I am a Discordian/SubG. But, like you said, I do have a \"particular point\" and it might help to consider that point before jumping into any group project that has the potential to bring harm back to yourself, unless THAT is what someone intends for themselves. It's nothing really personal, but sometimes things need another point of view. You could even say that my posts above were my little \"glitter bombs\" to disrupt your concept a little. See it can go both ways and a third. So do carry on. I am all for poetic terrorism, I just tend to weigh the outcomes a little. Again, I apologize to you and silenced (I am not above that). Alaudurel: Wow. To think that most of this started because I have the bad habit of carrying chalk around and talking about it... pardon the clichéd moment here, but I love this forum. The original intent here, as Arjil just stated, is not so much a global network of magic to tap into; it's a quiet rebellion, seeding seemingly random acts in an attempt to get the general population to wake up and trigger some gnosis our way. That the web has grown this much is interesting in itself, and would seem to mirror the premises of chaos in the completely random nature which this has progressed. To an extent, yes, we are firing a gun into the air; however, from intent and what was originally intended to go into this, it's much more along the lines of a paintball gun than a .45. Someone walking along the street feels a sting, looks at themselves, and suddenly sees themselves covered with a color from out of nowhere. Is it bad? The person felt discomfort and has to wash their clothing, sure; however, their thinking pattern should be changed a bit, along the lines of \"What if that was something more substantial?\" We want people to wake up and think, to embrace the odd and inexplicable as well as the meticulous.

I've spent the last couple of days examining my motives in involving myself in this project. I had a long talk with my friend Juan Kaotee and we set some parameters for our involvement. What do you know? The same thing has been going on here. I THINK that we're pretty much on the same page, as far as intent. I really doubt that anyone has malicious intentions. My divinations have shown that much to me. But hey, I could be wrong. It wouldn't be the first time. This idea, in one form or another, has existed for more than a decade. I jumped in because people were actually DOING something instead of sitting around theorizing. As for my actions with Ellis, I've limited myself to tagging places that I know to be wellsprings of power and marking a lot of money. Still, I haven't tagged anything over the last couple of days because I've been dealing with some negative issues, which have nothing to do with Ellis; so I figure I won't add my bullspit to the mix. I must say thanks again for this project. It has been the impetus for growth and experimentation. Otherwise, I would have stagnated for a good long time. It's sad, I know... But I've allowed myself to get stuck in the quagmire of day to day existence. So, at least this project has done one thing that it set out to do. Yeah... This kind of honesty, from strangers, makes me go a big rubbery one too.

Besides, we're Discordians *grin*shaking things up is what we do. As for weighing outcomes- yes I weighed them, and decided I'm willing to put myself at risk involving myself in this project.

Anyway, when she went to get her mother to show her I charged a crystal with some essence of Enchantment and slipped it into one of the pockets of the book. When she came back and got the book I could tell that she is going to be one interesting chick when she grows up, and the magick shall know her when it's time. It was cool. ChaosTech: Weeeeee! Rip the foundations of reality away and destroy us all in the holy fires of chaos in order to enlighten us all! This is like setting off bombs all over the earth, some a small as fireworks and other's the size of 100 kiloton nuclear bombs, in the hopes that it will enlighten the masses to the reality of magick and somehow then change the world for the better. This is insanity. If you truly believe in your efforts, I have a question to ask of you. You claim you are opening random portals, evoking random entities, etc, into the outside world, but are you doing this to your personal inside as well? The answer is obviously no, as you wouldn't be here if this was true as you would either be insane to the point you couldn't function anymore or dead outright. I admire your passion to \"enlighten\" the masses, but you are acting foolish. You are spreading nothing but destruction. What polarity do you think ignorance belongs to? The creative, constructive, life, side? Or the decomposing, destructive, death side? Certainly not the life side, as ignorance is a destructive concept to life. As far as thinking that opening both the mouths of the heavens and hells to this world will smack the reality of magick in the faces of the masses, indeed it will, but not in a way you want! Ever heard of the Dark Ages? People were more aware of the \"otherworldly\" than they ever have been or ever will be. The problem is that human's often focus on the negative way more than the positive, and so crazy shit like what happens in the Dark Ages happens. In essence everybody loses, ignorant or not. "},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":" 56 Order gives more possibilities to chaos to bloom into things it's never manifested into before. Why don't you use this knowledge and fashion your own constructs for chaos to form into to spread the magickal enlightenment you desire (like write a book that will reach and bring the reality of magick to thousands), while working within the framework of the very illusion that allows us to be. Think carefully before you execute your magick. Chaos has no care about anything, it is pure power. It only wants one thing, and that is to DO. Even the ancient's knew this. You can destroy yourself and or the world (or at least try to), or you can create yourself (evolve) and or the world. Chaos at it's core HAS NO FORM! You, I, and everything that is does indeed have form. A human absorbing pure chaos without an intent for it, is like being in a vortex. Channeling pure chaos is SUICIDE! This is what your linking sigil is. It has a channel to flow, but no program (construct), and thus intent and so is manifesting in truly chaotic ways, depending on uncountable variables of the construct that is this world which it is being channeled into. Magick (power) with no purpose (intent, will) is not only dangerous, but foolish. As I said if you want to change this reality you have to do it within the laws of this reality, even if they only extend to this reality system and are meaningless outside of it. Also I'm not attacking you all who have contributed, personally, as you can do whatever you want and as long as it doesn't affect me, my family and friends, I could care less. I'm rather selfish in this way, but it is how I am, and it keeps me sane as the world is to big to give any more concern over anyone else. I only post this at all, to save yourself from alot of shit, if not the end of your life. Magick ain’t child’s play folks. You can get hurt, or killed, physically. You probably knew this already, you just didn't think this through. Yes order is illusion. Yes this \"consensual reality\" is an illusion. But so is your body, mind, and every other part of you that has form. "},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":" 57Strange Divine: I was the paranoid individual who asked Nalyd for some input, which resulted in him posting in this thread. Therefore, I should clarify what has prompted my concern. Unlike many of you, I live in a rather small, rural community. In these types of communities, everyone knows everyone else, and knows everything that happens. Actually, I'm a bit reclusive and wouldn't hear about any gossip if it weren't for my mother's networking skills. However, there have been several unconventional, accidental deaths in this community following my involvement with the sigil. Aside from the deaths, there has been an increased number of non-fatal auto accidents. I won't presume a link, but the possibility of a correlation is impetus enough for me to feel wary. For those of you living in urban areas, it is conceivable that you wouldn't notice increased levels of unpleasantness as quickly, or as viscerally as someone living in a small community would. It's easier for me to find out about these things. Silenced: I've been reading & rereading ChaosTech's post. Its quite evocative I'll admit, and well thought out and presented with mutual benefit in mind. There is a cautionary note in many of these posts, and they are appreciated, but ultimately unnecessary. Most of us, I think anyway, HAVE examined our motives. Most of us do have a focus and intent, with a mind for consequences. We know that there is danger involved, for ourselves and everyone else. We understand that there are consequences of \"opening the heavens\" as CT put it. Our intent is very focused, it just does not seem so until one realizes that we are focusing on something much larger than the average mage. We are targeting reality, which though much larger than any of us can possibly process, is a viable target. All of the concerns in the previous cautionary posts are things most of us have already considered. Don't think for a moment that we have just leapt into this without a care or rational examination of our actions. The majority of us are rational, logical, and mature adults who have made a choice. We know that we are going to be stepping on people's toes, and we are willing to do so.

While there certainly are malign elements to it (since we are imposing a paradigm shift), people have to act as they feel they must. We just happen to be adversaries to the dominant worldview, and admittedly a large portion of the occult levels of society. If there are people out there who disagree with us, that's great, diversity is a key element of evolution. If there are people out there who will actively oppose us, that's fine too, conflict is an unavoidable side-effect of life as a dynamic actual entity of change (mage). Its kind of like that Egyptian god set, he is often portrayed as a divine enemy of sorts. A god of storms that, through his adversity, forces evolution (which could easily be seen as the solidification of individuality being forced upon the masses). If a person doesn't stand up for what they believe in, even if its counter-cultural, what good are they? Each individual has to act as their own conscience dictates. Apathy is for the weak. Thank god for free speech eh? ChaosTech: Silenced, well it's good to know you've thought this through and are a mature adult who accepts responsibility for your actions. The only question I have to ask though, is how is unleashing massive amounts of chaos, for the good or ill of humanity, going to change the world for the better? Or are you just trying to change the world, not for good or ill per say, just change it? If you are striving for utopianism, this is impossible. Many, both cowans (non magickal people) and magicians have tried this many times in the past and it never works, as there will always be those who fuck it up. Nayld23: Which paradigm are you trying to shift? There are literally thousands of paradigms circulating in the world right now. Some are more dominant than others but they all hold some ground being that they are paradigms. And what paradigm are you trying to shift to? Just curious. "},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":" 59 Silenced: Well, I'm going to try to do this right, so I'll try a metaphor (inevitable result of a theology degree).Yes, the are no doubt an infinity of paradigms out there in the world. When I say dominant paradigm, I mean the idea that there is only 1 view of reality. By tearing down this veil, others can be shown that reality can be anything, to show that there are no limits. An example of the limitations I am talking about would be: Jesus is the only way. There is no god but Allah and Mohammed is His Prophet. Science is the only answers. Magic doesn't exist. Humankind's Manifest Destiny. I'm not talking anarchy or utopia, just a realignment of our perceptions towards a more fluid & kinetic reality. To put it simply (with a few water references). Reality is a pool of water that has stagnated, we use a stick to stir it up. Reality is an aquarium full of fish dying because there isn't enough oxygen, so we churn the waters to get the tank re-oxygenated. I know it stinks that most of our posts and ideas are deconstructionist, and that we don't offer many suggestions about what to do afterwards or how to \"put the world back together\". Basically we are drawn to changing for the sake of change, for better or for worse. Its up to the people drawn to reconstruction to pick up the pieces and carry us into the \"better tomorrow\". Bad Metaphor Warning: We are like the cowboy who comes to town to liberate it from the bandit gang. We defeat the bandits by being like them (fight fire with fire). But, like all those western stories, at the end of it all, when the dust settles and the story ends, the cowboy is either dead or rides off into the sunset. Why? Because, the kind of rough son of a bitch that can defeat a gang of bandits IS NOT the kind of guy that should pick up the pieces and help the town recover. He's just as bad as the bandits, so he has to go when the movie is over. Did that make any sense or am I just spinning my wheels here?

As you said some will fight you for your efforts, some will support you, and some like myself will be neutral. I've decided to let the opposers and the supporters discuss this, I simply don't care. I will say this though. Fighting fire with fire in my experience only makes a bigger fire, and after the fire is out, only ashes of all it consumed remain. Out of the ashes will come new life, as long as the fire didn't become titanic and consume it all. Silenced: Couldn't have said it better myself. A Phoenix Reality is precisely the goal. I was told about www.letterboxing.org recently. After visiting the site I went to Hobby Lobby and picked up one of those little $4 boxes, wood burned a bunch of personal runes into it, then the linking sigil, and left this \"chaos box\" on a city trail. It not only radiates chaotic energy patterns, but if it is ever picked up there is a little glitter bomb surprise tucked away inside. I'm going to place a few more, and may just start placing them whenever I travel. Also, we could all start letterboxing, and all use the LS as our personal stamp, thus co-opting the entire letterboxing community. Alaudurel: I'm somewhat enthralled by the letterboxing concept for all this...it's along the lines of a project a friend of mine heralded, the Found Art Project (much along the same lines; create a work of art and leave it in a public place with a note explaining that whoever found it is entitled to keep it). Things along this line are perfectly synchronous"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":" 61with the glitterbomb idea; it adds a moment of wonder and clarity to a person's life, causing them to contemplate exactly what led to that moment. As far as destructive potential, yes, this could feasibly become a time-bomb of sorts; however, that is where original intent comes in. This is an honor system of sorts, trusting that those putting their efforts into it are going to follow the premise and not take the opportunity to sow needless destruction. Glitterbomb, people; not C-4. In an interesting update, the original chalkings that I did, close to a year ago, are still on the surfaces. They're quite prominent on the entryway to an administration building here in Lubbock, though completely open to the elements. The others I planted, as far as I've found, have all faded gradually; the original chaosphere and linking sigil, however, are still as visible as the day I drew them (with nothing than regular took-it-out-of-a-classroom chalk). I'll try to get a picture up, if such can be managed. Silenced: I have seen people in the park where I live doing something similar to the Found Art project, but they have been doing it with performance art (kind of a dance/impromptu monologue). Maybe one of the more performance savvy of our number could come up with something along those lines. I've noticed a similarity in your chalking exploits to some of my own. Tags that should have withered by now have stayed visible, yet others faded within a day or two. It may be that the sigil has the potency to stand up to the elements and time thanks to the power of what we are doing and the symbol itself. Then again maybe the kind of chalk I'm using is just well suited to certain surfaces. The one staying are on brick walls, while concrete seems to shed the tag rather quickly. Ideas? 8CS: I was just wondering if anyone else had actually tried to commune with Ellis at all? It must be growing into something more servitor-esque by now. All I get is a distant sense of a random form. Vaguely humanoid but shifting around, like it was made of bees but they're not bees. More like just black dots. Any similar experiences? "},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":" 62 Alaudurel: I find it rather odd that the sigil has evolved to this extent. We used it originally as a sort of accent along with other sigils, to link them into the network, as it were. That the sigil, in itself, has become apparently a thing of power and is, despite its relative newness, supposedly gaining a consciousness is, to me, an occult evolutionary marvel. Nothing is true, as they say. Silenced: I agree, a most unexpected yet exhilarating situation. Frotish Mewn: I made an attempt the other day. At first there was nothing, then I noticed a change. I saw something similar to the black dots, swarming around in a roughly globular shape. It reminded me somewhat of the Iad Uroboros from The Great and Secret Show and Everville by Clive Barker. Then it looked like a slowly roiling spheroid of plasma. Eventually I began to get a \"voice\", speaking slowly. I haven't done much in the way of evocation, so I'm not sure of my skill. From a brief \"conversation\" I got that Ellis just wants to be acknowledged and for the LS to be spread. The energies let in by the LS's are not of a positive or negative energy. It's just what it is. Ellis doesn't seem to really have any will or desire other than what I already mentioned. I got the impression that he's of a neutral disposition and can be easily directed by anyone who works with him. Can anyone else try and see if they can confirm this or share anything else. As I said, I'm not really sure of my skill in this area. Silenced: Ok, I apologize for the crap visualization, but its the best description of what I get from Ellis. My experience of the LS web before we decided it was Ellis, was more like plugging into a computer network, like a big datastream. Now that its Ellis, when I am in contact with it I still have access to the datastream aspect of the web, but layered over it is something akin to the \"Crystalline Entity\" from Star Trek (nerdy, but what the hey). And it’s not as much sentient in my experience as it is driven by the impulses that"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":" 63we have bred into it. Though I'll bet anything that it’s different for all of us, given its patchwork creation, purpose, and sustenance. Suppose one or more of us tags the Golden Gate bridge, or maybe the Arch in St. Louis, or maybe the Statue of Liberty or something of that nature. Would Ellis change the nature/meaning of the monument on a subtle level (thus becoming useful to us as a tool for 'mixing it up'), or would the monument simply act as any other tag point or building? I guess what I'm wondering is, is it possible to change the meaning/significance of a place by changing its magical resonance? Extreme and near impossible example: Perhaps with enough juice, could the Statue of Liberty be transformed from having political significance to occult significance by changing its resonance? (Given that even non-mage people can be sensitive to such things?) ChaosTech: Sense Ellis's only purpose so far is to spread. How about programming him to not only desire to spread, but do what he was intended to all along? That being enlightening people to the hidden world of infinite possibility (occult)? I would suggest programming him to do this in a positive, non harmful way to his targets, that being the people influenced by the sigils where his presence is, as a negative experience of the occult is just going to make people fear it and either deny it and or abstain from it, and or convince others to do the same as well. Which will do the exact opposite of what you all are trying to achieve. Also, a neutral experience wouldn't work either, as this would just cause neutrality to the occult and so indifference. Silenced: I wholeheartedly agree. I for one have always pushed my programming of Ellis in that direction in addition to self-propagation. I also agree that, in general, positive workings are a more efficient approach (as wonder & mystery has more growth potential than conflict & horror). Though the darker aspects of this project still have their place, I think that most of our workings should focus on the more positive elements. However, I"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":" 64am also prepared to reverse my tactics should the conflict & horror aspect become the most efficient approach (I doubt that will ever be the case, but you never know). As to the monuments, most of those are generally positive icons, and it would be alot easier to channel their potency to our goals if we worked with a positive mindset. ChaosShaman: Hey guys, I've just been looking at this thread and I am interested in how your magick is manifesting. For example, are there any 'real life' effects that you have record of? and do you consider the effects to be confined to one geographical location? Also, in terms of shadows, what kinds of servitors and hauntings have so far been produced by the technique? Silenced: Well, the results have been subtle as to the environment itself. I put Ellis tags and other spells all over the industrialized parts of town, along the tracks, and at the abandoned train station. In several spots I have noticed that someone has placed the symbol considered by most to be the hobo tag for \"untrustworthy person\" near my sigils. So they are definitely feelings its effects, though they seem to be reacting along the lines of creeped out and avoidance of the area. I feel bad sort of for spooking them, but now there is a 'strange' place on the underworld map. I also found that the pillars under an overpass I had tagged were covered in Futhark runescript. Someone had layered over all 4 pillars (about 6ft of runescript on each pillar), blending the futhark with my linking sigil & spell. Combining to make some pretty impressive work. For the most part, I feel the magical resonance of the places I have linked to be higher, thus making my awareness, potency, and magick in general easier to work, sense, and empower. So I would say that the most important change is the increased levels of magical resonance in the environment. Making magick better for mages, and making it possible to be perceived and experienced by the general population. "},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":" 65Nightshade: So far it's been my experience that where ever I place the sigil, the surrounding area gets a little wyld. It's like all the long-shot probabilities get tested over and over at a progressed rate until that probability comes due. I've developed a couple of variants and I'm waiting for the right time to test them. For the most part, I've stuck to ensorcelling places that already have strong energetic qualities. As a result, I've gotten a sort of rush whenever I've tagged one of these \"nodes\". As for Ellis as an entity... So far, not much with the personality, but there enough to make several local spirits a little... edgy. Other Will-workers have taken notice. Most seem to have caught on and seem to be doing something similar. It seems that we're a little linked as well. Just go back and read through this thread. You'll see. As for geographical location, it really seems to link these together after a fashion. I haven't explored the implications of this to any great extent. If anyone else has, I'd be interested in hearing about it. Ceriel Nosforit: I'm using Ellis as an avatar for a forum that I frequent. I've also started drawing the sigil on money, and printed out 140 copies of it that I intend to spread around the city. There's already a lot of people here who place stickers with simple images on _everything_, but I haven't seen any other sigils. Anyway, Finland is about to be linked. Nightshade: OK. It's time to bump this thread back to page one. How could it have fallen away? Especially since tagging is now an almost acceptable form of expression. I've seen a lot of reference to tagging in the media. Example: Dead Like Me, a showtime series, just had the death of a tagger featured in one scene. Watch the show and you'll know why that's relevent. Anyway, I went to one of my favorite spots and decided to find out if Ellis answers simple evocations... I'm not sure if something decided to pose or if it was Ellis but I got a VERY developed ethereal response. All I can say is try it and see what happens. Until the other day, I had only had vague impressions or, like Silenced; I had \"seen\" lines of force. My partner in reality crime has been leaving Ishtar eggs around. He takes plastic eggs and"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":" 66covers them with his art and various sigils, then he places spell components inside and the LS on paper wraps these things up. Whoever finds these artful surprises (He's REALLY very good at his Art) will know that they've found something of Magickal import. Anyone can tell that a Sigil a small candle and a mini incense stick and a couple of other goodies has to do with something mystical. Nice, huh? We've been doing a lot of strange work lately. Like tagging the state capital building and the entrance to the Governor's mansion... Hope we do some good! Finland is getting linked, huh? Cool! Ellis could use a little northern exposure. Yes, I'm grinning like a Cheshire Cat... Jack Hectic: WHERE DO I SIGN UP???!!! Silenced: By showing up here you just did. I've been using a few drops of blood on some of my tags and comparing the environmental & resonance results with tags done without the blood. Now it is likely that the blood tags are more potent because on a personal level blood magick is kinda my thing sometimes, but it hit me with an idea about personal involvement. Like the reverse of the voodoo hair & nails thing. You could further empower your own sigils with bodily fluid, but it seems to me that you can 'steal' tags from others in the same way. Let's say that there is a gang tag in a certain part of town, you could (after making sure noone is watching so you don't get shot), spit or bleed on it as an act of 'taking over'. Then bend and twist the purpose of the tag on a magical level to suit your own ends. Effectively you could hook up the gang tag to Ellis, overpower its original meaning, and start force-feeding magick into gang culture. Yeah it would put some pretty intense juju into Ellis, but let's face it, alot of those guys have some real chutzpah. Nightshade: Scaaaaaaary... I just had a dream about that last night! Well, sort of. It ended with some Latin Kings covering my back while I did a particularly public tag."},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":" 67Which is a bit strange. At any rate, it's a good idea. Careful though! Every crew of Kings has at least one Brujo. No kidding. Come to think of it, I may have met one in that dream. There was only one clear face in the bunch and I've never met this person in the flesh. Who knows? Dreams are... A little difficult to figure out sometimes. I've made some personal inks for this project and have added other oils to the mix of pens, chalks and paints (Yes, the kind that one uses on the exterior of a house! Gonna use a roller too.). I'm just itching to try these out! I've just moved and. Yeah, those pesky responsibilities have a way of taking up one's time. It's a good thing I have friends who are working on this too! I don't know what I'd do without \"Don Kaotee\", \"Juan Chaotee\" and \"Y. Li ChaoT\". Not the most original names for a crew of Rag Taggers, I know, but I'd say we're ready to Ragnerok'n'Roll if needs be! If anyone wants the recipe for an ink, like Dove's Blood or Bat's Blood (No actual blood in the mix unless you add your own) just let me know. When I get this new ink perfected I'll give out a recipe. The new ink burns and sparkles, then you'll never remove it without serious sand blasting! It's one of those \"use with extreme caution\" things. I just thought that the pretty sparkles would help me tap into certain Forces during the actual charging. Oh! Get this: There's this empty theatre that Don Kaotee tagged with chalk. The front entrance already had numerous tags. The city decided to clean it up a bit and guess what didn't get touched?!? I've looked over the other sites and found that other tags got erased and the LS is still untouched... There are some exceptions though. Other Sigils have been left alone in some spots. I'm not sure who these other Will-Workers are but I'd like to meet them! One more progress report: When I jumped into this, there was some SERIOUS enmity going on around my locale. Yes, I've stepped on a few toes. Yes, I've SUFFERED for it. Here's the payoff: There's been a lot less in the way of \"Psychic Landmines\" and a lot more of a cooperative energy going about. I think we're doing some good. I hope y'all are getting some positive results too!"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":" 68 Ceriel Nosforit: Linking Finland isn't going too quick, but hey, I'm not in a hurry. I'm starting out small, but keeping my eyes open for opportunities to go bigger. I figure the less friction I see getting Ellis into the environment, the less friction it will cause. I want things to run smooth, to run like music. Also, NightShade, you got me thinking; wouldn't it be interesting to do a completely public tagging, with nothing but Ellis? Say pin the sigil up on a billboard while passers by were watching? The tagger would do a lot of emotional charging if they usually do it discretely, and the direct attention of people should be beneficial aswell. Silenced, that's quite an instrumental approach to Ellis. Much like how yours truly approaches everything in life. Naturally, I like it. Iamu: I just figured I'd let the record show that I tagged the link sigil in the perfect spot at work today (I'm in North Jersey, if anyone's keeping on eye on the geography of the net), and about a minute later while talking to a co-worker, I felt its energy kinda slam me in the side of the head. I'll spare ya the laundry list of corroborating little incidents, but let's just say that, overall, today definitely smacked of chaos more than usual. I'm gonna tag up a couple of \"thin places\" in my general area right now... I'm curious to see how the fields in these spots will react. Nightshade: Thin places... Nice term! I have a \"soft spot\" for creative terminology. Totally let us know if you get some hardcore results. Ceriel Nosforit, A public audience for a tag? Whoa! Around here, the laws are such as to make that kind of risky. Since I've done a few under video surveillance (sp?) I've learned the subtle art of disguise and the not so subtle art of full on glamoury. So, I like it! \"Juan\" mentioned us rappelling off an interstate highway bridge and doing a really BIG tag (dressed as scary clowns) so... Maybe we'll do it. Or something like it. It's the get away that's difficult. Getting caught would suck in the worst kind of way! Oh! and definitely take your time! Well, I'm off (WAY off) to DO some of these things instead of sit here and write about them."},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":" 69 Ceriel Nosforit: It doesn't have to be done illegally, but dressing up as scary clowns does definitely sound a bit too fun an opportunity to pass up. Say you managed to get Ellis on a big sheet of paper you could pin it up on the bulletin board of a local supermarket (Around here, every grocery store has a bulletin board.) - If someone asks what it is, you can say you don't know. (A child sees a bird, learns its name, and never sees a bird again. Label Ellis and the mystery is taken away.) Maybe you've seen the tag around and was hoping you'd find out what it means? Add an email address and the adventure begins. Anyway, it's very easy to hide in a crowd. Act suspiciously and one is suspected. And acting dumb will get one out of the tightest spots. Pax Noctis: Add Long Island to the list. I work in and around a lot of school, and I have sidewalk chalk out the wazoo. Who better for curious, active energy than kids? I've also taken to using the Linking Sigil in my nightly, Astral energy work, essentially dumping as much free energy as I can into the system. Hail Chaos. Silenced: Well, finally bought my tickets yesterday, so now its official. Me & Ellis are going to be in Washington DC for the election, (actually flying out election day so I can get back home to vote). I can't say that I'm arrogant enough to think that my actions alone could change the outcome, but every little bit helps I suppose. I feel compelled to jump in with both feet and mix it up. Besides, choking the seat of our government with the linking sigil + other assorted magickal acts is going to be empowering, entertaining, and hopefully effective. It seems to me that all eyes will be in that direction, so why not go for it? Nightshade: It's good to know that someone is thinning the veil at Long Island. Silenced, I'm sure you will take advantage of the Capitol Hill layout. The Temple-like \"floorplan\""},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":" 70is kind of perfect for Magickal Operations. Although it's design says \"Order, Order\", we all know that the \"Founders\" all had a thing for throwing revolutions and not just here in the US. I'm sure they’d like whatever you've got planned. I was telling a friend how Street art and tagging is now in the mainstream consciousness and made mention of it here too. The next day I picked up a local publication and the front page has the title \"Let us Spray\" and an article that was pretty neat. Funny how that works, huh? Well, I've got work to do (Mystikal and otherwise). Son of a Montage: Silence, you should dress up in a suit and tie and hand out Bush buttons with Ellis on his forehead. Make sure you have your hair slicked back. I'm sure you can come up many different ideas. This should help: http://www.rtmark.com/index.html Nightshade: I went to tag a significant crossroad and guess what I found there? A sticker for some union election that says: Elect ELLIS President of ...\" Part of the sticker was missing. Now how could I not tag that spot? So, just above the sticker is a nice phat tag and all the State office people are going to catch a glimpse of this every day. I'll be continuing to infuse the spot with a special imaginative energy. Something to get folks dreaming on a more conscious level and remind them that there's more than just the banal world of office drudgery. Hope it works!

I'm very curious about how you suffered and what action you took to change things in your area. Nightshade: OK, most of the \"Suffering\" I speak of is really the pangs of RAPID and somewhat uncontrolled change. I learned with a quickness, that one doesn't just slap places with a Sigil and not have any specific goal in mind. Yes, this is elementary I know, but I had to see what Ellis did on it's own. For awhile, it was as if the Universe itself abhorred my existence. I had a lot of strange and dangerous incidents for about a month there. Things LITERALLY fell apart around me. I think that I posted some of those results. Among them was the speeding up of probabilities, like car accidents (Like 12 in one week--All within a block of any given tag). Doubt can hurt... A lot of things changed on me before I got MYSELF together and started reworking the environment. Then, came the almost immediate attention of several other Will-workers. Some were just curious and left Signs of their own and others reacted with mistrust and hostility. So, there were things left at spots that weren't so nice (Counter Magick signs wrapped around copies of LS with dead birds and other stuff left in paper bags is one example). As I said, there was already some enmity among local Practitioners of differing Traditions. I devised several variants of LS. One in particular helped a lot. It's LS, but in place of outgoing \"arrows\", I made \"X\"s. For me, this symbolized a Stasis. My intention was to \"Lock out\" such influences from the Web. These \"StaticX\" LSs were then scratched into Black Stones (jet) and left where ever I encountered one of those \"Psychic Landmines\". Sure, this in no way weakened a given spell meant for specific targets but it did keep the effects from anyone working with Ellis. These activities died down a lot within a couple of weeks. By this time, I had drawn others into the project. Some have more time on their hands than others. So, Variants of the Sigil are cropping up everywhere and in more bold locales (I'm hitting a local monument in front of a Police station in the NEAR future). I've actually watched a couple of spots and seen peoples' reactions to this. I've listened to a"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":" 72few comments as well (Never letting them know that I had anything to do with it). Folks are curious about tags like this and why it's obvious that more than one person is responsible. \"Is it a cult?\" \"Is it a new gang?\" \"Who or what is 23Skadu?\" ...And best of all, I've watched as OBVIOUSLY Occult minded folks point out these Marks to friends (Including one acquaintance of mine pointing out MY OWN work to me!). Most productive of all, are the \"Ishtar eggs\" that one of my buddies makes. They are lovely to look at. Filling them with the trappings of spell-work was my idea. I've painted shoe boxes and other containers and filled them with the components for whatever type of spell I felt like casting along with a nicely drawn Ellis Talisman. Then I stash these in places and wait for someone to find them. They don't know exactly what they've found but they know it's of an occult nature. Essentially, they cast the spell just by examining the contents. This goes TRIPLE for someone who DOES know what they're looking at. So, I've made sure that most of these spell-kits are geared towards nice things. I feel it's lessened the paranoia 'round here. Essentially, we've let them know that even if there were a new Cult in town, it means them no harm. If anything, I'll bet there are a whole bunch of people looking to join. So, maybe they'll just have to start their own cults and if they're cool; maybe I'll join... HA! With the exception of what's said here and conversations within my little Cabal (If you could call us that) anonymity(sp?) is key. We're just doing our thing. Others are beginning to do similar things. Like I said in a previous post, Graffiti has suddenly become VERY popular in these parts but gang related incidents are down. Not bad for 4 months work, huh? Gotta go for now, but I'll post more about this all later. yeah, there's more... Visceral/Spagyrical: I burned a CD of books in .pdf for a friend of mine--also an occultist. In addition to the books, I included a .jpg of the LS, so that he could use it if he chose to. He copied the info to his hard drive and immediately contracted a nasty virus that prevented him from running certain important .exe files. The both of us thought the"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":" 73virus was somewhere in one of the books on the CD, so we both scanned the CD, but found nothing. Personally, I think the LS was the virus, but I can't exactly prove that. Arjil: Just out of curiosity, do you mean virus as in a strictly computer related way? I mean, there's the whole \"spirits in the wires\" thing to contend with, but if you got it either here or on the marauder site, unless it got hacked and messed with, it wasn't the LS. I made it in paint and wouldn't know how to attach a virus to it even if I wanted to. Now, manifestations of chaos and net gremlins could easily find their way through the LS into a computer- which is precisely why one should have their computer Warded *grin* Oh. and Nightshade- Nice. That's what I'm talking about. Visceral/Spagyrical: No, I'm saying the LS brought a little Chaos to my friend's computer. Ceriel Nosforit: This may not really be topical, but some may be interested to know that there are people out there who spend an great deal of time and effort on scanning and analyzing data from the entire net. I don't know what they are looking for, and the only reason I know that they are doing this is that someone reported an obscure bug (in a piece of software used for scanning) that only shows up when scanning absolutely insanely huge selections. Moral of the story: People would hardly be looking if they did not suspect there was something to be found. There may very well be ghosts in these machines.

It's kind of like the mainframe created by the LS. Each LS is a little computer connected to one big web. Nightshade: Seriously, the Cross was taken by a pragmatic church that made it their own. I've no doubt that the LS will be inherited by those who come after us and it's meaning and power will evolve. It has already. Ellis, is becoming more... Palpable in my experience. Anyone else? OK... Just how many servitors have been tied to the Web anyway? I met one recently and it was of great help. Thanks to whomever created it! I really needed the extra cash! So, if you're walking along and should \"See\" an entity pushing along and it shifts direction and come right up to you, don't freak out! The one I mentioned above (Who shall remain unnamed here) was in the midst of a big whirlwind. Which brings me to: The truly neat discovery that our collective servitors may be able to travel ANYWHERE along the Web, independent of our knowledge. I had never really considered this before a couple of weeks ago. Also, Servitors that are tied to the Web seem to be able to manifest with greater ease than others. I'll have to describe some of the variants to you. As I'm not sure how to post pictures. So, here they are (The main ones anyway): There's the \"Closed LS\" which is a couple of pages back on this thread. I've come to think of it as a Grounding LS. Instead of it Radiating Chance, it seems to draw it in. Thus, making that area more \"stable\". When there's lightning flashing everywhere, it's good to have a grounding rod, somewhere. There's the \"StaticX LS\" as I mentioned before. It's been used to \"Lock\" things out of the Web. Then there's one I haven't really named yet... Each of the Arrows have been replaced with an \"Ing\" rune. You know, the Futhark letter that looks like a blocky double helix and represents replication anyway. I've used it in this way:"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":" 75 Take an object from the surroundings of a place you are about to tag (Stones, leaves... Whatever is \"tied\" to the place).

From that location you may Charge the original... I suppose you could take a picture of your tag and use that as a connection when Charging From Afar, but I don't own a camera.

Bread Sandwich: Ah, I have the sigil now. At work, I was doodling sigils to bring about some glorious but unspecific future change. I am beginning to see a plan forming. Nightshade: A few days ago, I had a strange experience concerning the LS. It's happened once before: I kept having the sigil \"appear\" and flash bright in my head for no reason that I could discern. Connection? Then again, I went to my favorite node and found that someone had taken my banner down (I had guessed this). They didn't trash it and they left it face up. I knew someone would eventually mess with it. There ARE other people who \"Work\" there. Last night, I honored the Hekate there and left little Offerings (And put the sign back up). I'm gonna make a better sign for the spot. The spiritual activity there is gone beyond what it was. One of these days, I'm gonna have to meet that Witch though. As the garlic left at the node, is mirrored in the garlic that someone planted on the corner of where I work. Well, it's time to do some things.

Silenced: As I mentioned in a previous post, I went to Washington DC this weekend for the express purpose of stuffing Ellis down the throat of our great country's governmental center. Yes, I specifically waited until the night before elections to make my move (mostly for the timing/magick, but also plane tickets are oddly very cheap for this weekend). I've only been back home for about an hour, but had to let everyone know the gist of what went down. Just to let you know what you jolly folk can now reach out and touch via Ellis. Constitution and Bill of Rights - I traced out the LS sigil (security didn't arrest me for pointing and gesturing oddly). Left a servitor to keep things powered up and going. Department of Justice - Traced out the LS sigil on the steps of the building and another at the door, also left a servitor to keep it up. White House - Jumped in the air to snap off a branch of a tree growing in the compound (if its good enough for pagans its good enough for me), and used it as a connective element (wand) to trace out the sigil while at the mid point (facing the front door directly), left a servitor to keep things going. So there you are, the door is wide open, do what you will.

After seeing these glitches and general screw-ups in the election, I'm seriously beginning to wonder now -smirks- I don't mean to drag up a dead and/or dying topic with the concept of the Ellis/election day link, but it is certainly becoming something to think upon. Mauschen: I taped the linking sigil to one of the main printers at work. An hour later a huge disaster happened with the Christmas catalogues that were supposed to go out. ( I work at a bindery that distributes local newspapers and flyers). Basically everything had to be re-printed as somebody wasn't paying attention, and printed the wrong labels. about 3 hours of extra work for whoever it was that messed up. Also, I taped them to the switchboard, and almost straight away the complaints started coming in. It was unreal. About 70 in an hour and a half. The odd thing was, nobody removed them. they were in clear sight. Phasianidae: Oh, sweet.

The very term \"glitter bomb,\" like \"smart drugs,\" or \"Marilyn Manson\" - [so named for Charles Manson, Marilyn Monroe, Light Dark, etc, if you don't know] - is a \"whatthe?\" for people to stop.

Good mages will be less susceptible, usually. \"Normal\" people don't even think of psychic/spiritual \"Security,\" they're vessels waiting for a purpose. Might as well utilize them before your enemies do. Here in NYC there's an area downtown where there’s a black or white marijuana leaf apparently spray painted perfectly neatly on traffic light bases, I believe. Every so often you see it again. These \"leaves\" have become, only somewhat consciously so far, my sigils in a sense, as I'm a devout worshipper of She whom I shall call \"The Goddess Sensemilla, the All Knowing, Mind Blowing,\" the Spirit of one of people's favorite potentially spiritualizing plants and pastimes. They remind me how I'm walking in an area where she is otherwise not allowed to be enjoyed (cops in vans just waiting for potheads, ooh, the threat to society...). Awesome thread, I checked the site out. Great stuff. Nightshade: So, I'll mention this one more time: From my experience, LS by itself and with no other spell/intent can be very dangerous... Most of us have probably noticed this. When placed with another sigil, it works just fine. It seems to push the probabilities over and over until the one you intend comes up. Simple. Left alone, it just pushes probabilities... The entropy level goes WAY up. Don't believe me. Seriously.

Keeping these things in mind, it's still a powerful tool. Just don't burn yourself out too fast. Ya Know? I'll be happy to create an essay or two.

Mauschen: Something weird happened at work last night at 9pm. I had stuck a few of the linking sigils around my desk last week and had forgotten about them. Then this morning a co-worker (who was working late) tells me that she was walking by my desk and she heard music. She looked around to see if the computer was on. It was off. I have no radio. and she even checked inside my drawers to see where the noise was coming from. She checked the whole freaking office but she said she could only hear the music when she was standing at my desk. Bood Samel: There's a few spots in Philly I'm gonna put the linking sigil up in. I'll make a stencil of it. First over at the abandoned oil refinery I spoke of in the thread I started. Also in this one alley. In center city Philadelphia there's this alley called Moravian St. that runs sporadically across all of down town. But there’s a good stretch of it that runs from 18th St. to Broad St. (Philly has no 14th, Broad is 14th). It's an ugly scar of dead space surrounded by expensive stores and office buildings.

Drop and River: I am formulating a book of sigils and other chaos related visual magical implements, and I have made the Linking Sigil of Ellis the first sigil. I also have Skavan's and some one of the sigils from the sigil housing project (the one to enhance magical ability), and am about to draw in both of Izabael's sigils, along with some of my own. The Linking Sigil is giving the book a decent energy boost, and as soon as I activated it the book just *felt* different. Just another addition in the World Wide Web of Ellis Chaos lol. This is going to be interesting. Silenced: I recently watched the movie 13 ghosts for the first time and there was an element to the movie I thought might be useful to us. There was a part in the movie where one of the characters is creating a massive binding ritual using etched plexi-glass and a souped up gyroscope. The interesting part was that the character was using pre-recorded ceremonial magick in conjunction with his own spells. While I have been toying with the idea of integrating such things into my own practice, that got me to thinking about doing this with Ellis. The idea is that one of the more computer savvy people here could write a program that would call up a graphics window and draw the linking sigil over and over, like a screensaver. If we could ad that to the marauder site or other sites, anytime a visitor opened the site the program would run in a window somewhere on the site, effectively casting the sigil right there in front of them. Think about some of the sites out there that have many thousands of hits a day. I'm no hacker, but the idea makes me want to be. Thoughts? Reactions? Is this possible? "},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":" 81 Drop and River: That would be awesome and would probably work. I also was bored and an idea came to me: get a map (globe is better) and charge the Linking Sigil on Ley Line Nexuses (sp?); the Chaos could float along with the energy in the line like a chemical drifts with water. Yes, some sympathetic magic must be used, but it is very doable. Nightshade: I think there are a bunch of Spirits, Servitors and Others already traversing the Lines. I mentioned meeting someone's Servitor and it helped me out. Funny thing is, many appear willing to answer to the name Ellis. They are still \"Themselves' but the connection is there. In Voodoo, there are Families of Spirits. One may call on Eshu/Ellegua and any number of Spirits who are in the Family will answer. Oddly enough, I got Glitterbombed and it's fitting to this conversation: So, I'm walking along with one of my Associates; we're talking about our Workings and planning some real nice ones and there is a box on the corner. We check it out and see that there are some cool things in there. Note: It was left under an LS tag. It's dark out so we decide to take the whole box and examine the goodies at my place. On the way back to my house, I start humming the theme from \"I dream of Genie\". It turns out, that the contents of the box had an \"Alladin\" theme... There was magnetic jewelry, gemstone beads, Art supplies of all sorts and a whole bunch of Aladdin toys (Mostly the Genie). Basically, we were given things that will aid in some VERY cool Glitterbombing activities. I won't be lacking Glitter glue or metallic pens and other neat stuff for a while. Next day, I'm walking to work and I can't help but hum the \"Prince Ali, Fabulous He, Ali Ababua\" song from the film. What do you think I found? A doll of Aladdin and next to him is the cape accessory that makes him \"Prince Ali\"... This was nowhere near the other site.

Nothing big, really...But I was considering a map of the Vatican and slapping Ellis right on top of it...Possibly at the Pope's lil party palace -grins evilly- Could make life entertaining. Drop and River: I think that if you put the LS on the large nexuses of the Ley Lines, AND put it on the Vatican, you are going to have some interesting results. BUT remember, a lot of orthodox religion goes on there, which will in turn end up spreading into our \"web\". Do we want that energy to mix with our pleasant chaos? Silenced: I think the idea of using maps to generate magical results is a fascinating idea. You could focus the power into the actual physical/astral reality of those locations via the map. Maybe even take a map and \"redraw\" it with the LS sigil incorporated somehow. It might be worth it to slap the sigil on maps in gas stations & bookstores, maybe a person following an \"Ellis Map\" would find themselves led into adventure and magic.

That is such a cool idea! -grins- Which gives me many, many nifty theories and ideas of my own...I'll get back to you on the astral stuff once I sort them all out. Silenced-That would be rather cool. I'd assume that the spots which are glitterbombed would be marked on the map as some sort of ultra special attraction (along with the usual haunted spots, pre-existing or otherwise). Maybe a little faux history surrounding the glitterbombed sites? DropAndRiver-I've been mulling it over and it seems you are right...That sort of stuff could, theoretically (no way in Hell was I testing THAT), infect Ellis...So maybe if an additional servitor or two were placed nearby... Perhaps one (or both, if need be) programmed to turn the existing energy neutral. The other - working under the assumption it hasn't been used - could be programmed with turning the neutral juice towards making life more interesting while Ellis does it's thing. Now then, the servitors could be made vampyric, or they could just feed on something like lust (That'd be real fun...and real easy...to introduce into the Vatican) or maybe even have them go solar power o.o;; I don't think it sounds too bad, but it's my idea so naturally it sounds good to me, no matter how stupid it really is. "},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":" 84Frotish Mewn: I went to NYC today and had some fun. When I got there I connected to the mind of the city and asked to be shown wonders. I ended up walking down this block loaded with magick and opportunity. Above the entrance to one building was a Chaos star, which set me in action. While I didn't leave any physical LS's, I did hook Ellis up to a few point starting with the Chaos star. I hooked him up to greenman-like faces on the building fronts. One that seemed almost too good was a picture someone had in their window. It was the head of the Statue of Liberty with a massive beehive hairdo, and it said, \"In the pursuit of life, liberty and big hair\" or something close to that. When I hooked Ellis up to the pic, I saw in my mind's eye the picture's eyes glowing. Whatever magick is going on in that block is now part of the web. I did hook up a few other places, but none had that air of magick to them. Silenced: I was wondering if anyone had any cheap method of making rubber stamps or any sort of stamp really, maybe paraffin? The idea is that we could carry around an inkpad & stamp kit, with the LS sigil, a Solomnic Seal, or a chaosphere, and tag things that are not normally accessed by paint or chalk. I'm thinking about stamping money when we have it. Going into offices and quickly stamping the first 10 forms in the stack while the receptionist isn't looking. Stamping any IRS form you run across, or maybe even hitting all of those Christian & politics pamphlets circulating about. Maybe stamp books in stores, like all of their bibles, every copy of the davinci code, and the inside jacket of every book on wicca out there. 8CS: Because my magick theories often revolve around 'urban' landscapes and areas like dumps, abandoned buildings, train lines and bridges etc., I’ve started using all my old transport tickets. leaving them around like maybe someone could use them, or half sticking out of the machine like I bought one but didn’t grab it from the machine, etc, but when you flip it over its got Ellis, another sigil, and a little drop of blood. "},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":" 85Lotic Trance: Okay, I have no idea how I could have missed this thread for so long, but it's kicking my ass. And I've only hardcore read the first 3 pages -- I swear to Eris I will go through the rest. I've got the linking sigil on some dollar bills I'll be spending tonight on coffee, cigarettes, etc. I've got an extra buck tucked away in the back of my wallet for the tip jar at work, complete with sigil (total fnordage of the entire hotel, it'll be great). Monday nights -- apropos enough, today! -- is an open mic/slam-style poetry gig at a local coffeehouse to which I've been going for a good six months now, straight. It's gotten so that enough people really like my style that I'm one of the few that manages to get everyone's attention -- and the applause proves it, I'm not just being a bastard. I'll work this coming week, or maybe even later today, on working up some verbal sigils, since spoken and written word is what I'm good at, and project those mothers into the crowd next Monday (which will be a VERY highly charged night, as two friends I haven't seen in over a year will be here for it). I'll let you all know how that goes. Also, the bathroom there, at the Acoustic Coffeehouse, well, it's graffiti-prone, and as such two walls are painted black and they have chalk in there for our enjoyment. I'll probably drop some stuff in the middle of bigger text, and make off with some chalk to wreak havoc across eastern Tennessee and southwest Virginia, heh. Also, I caught that bit earlier by v/s about alchemical tattoos. My first tat was a stylized, chrome, almost graffiti-looking Eye of Osiris, and my second and recently healed is a rose, tearing through the skin. I've got a bunch of ideas on what to do with my sleeves (once I can afford it, ouch), including some sigil work. The process of getting it put on would be enough to charge and release it, all at once Especially since I'm so freakin' skinny, heh. I'm not totally sure how I'll come up with spoken word sigils; I'm thinking I'll work with a phrase and possibly turn it into a Sanskrit-sounding mantra or dharani and work that in at some point. I'm sure I could just break down the composite connotations of whatever intent I'm using and scatter that through the entire poem while I reach a more feverish pitch, and climax with some drastic change to make people forget. "},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":" 86Arjil: You should look into the concept of neuro-linguistic programming. Also I've found that if you're speaking the words yourself, you can infuse the words with magick- kinda like The Voice from Dune. It's the bard trick. I suppose what you could do is create a sigil to do *something* and bind it to a specific word, or line in a poem for example, or an entire poem now that I think about it. You'd have to craft your sigil then recite your line over and over whilst empowering your sigil until your subconscious accepted that series of sounds to mean that particular sigil. Funnel your magick through your voice as you recite it and the sigil shall be cast. You could also use a shape poem, I'm sure you've seen the poem about a coke in the shape of a coke bottle- same thing, craft your sigil, then write your text in the pattern of the sigil, and scribe the magick to the text with your voice as you read it, that would be a good one for a scroll of multilayered enchantment. Nightshade: WARNING: INSANE RANT FOLLOWS! I keep saying to myself \"Maybe I should take a break from this\" or something to that affect and then, I get about a dozen opportunities that very same day/evening. Some of these just can't be passed up. So I do it and the thing is, I'm incredibly pumped up when I do. Physically jazzed, zizzed or maybe it's Zos'd... When I say that I just can't pass these up, I mean that they're just too tasty. For instance, this evening, I'm wandering home and find the perfect little area that is viewable only to a playground for an afterschool/daycare centre. I just HAD TO DO IT: tomorrow morning, the kids will all see some stars (Pentagram and a few others including the Unicursal Hexagram and a Chaos symbol) a Moon and of course, LS. The printing says: YOU ARE MAGICKAL On another angle of this whole thing, someone has set a couple of stumbling blocks for me. I'm not worried. They have an idea of me (Erroneous as it may be) and they probably know that I'm a little... Quickly and therefore (im)possibly dangerous. It's Strange because they didn't outright deface the Sigil but they wrote a little something to counter it: \"No! F@<! him and his world\" .... What the?!? You know? Anyway, it's funny how"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":" 87the weathering removed most of their message but left Ellis intact... The word \"NO\" was still there and bits of lettering but nothing really distinct. Of the letters that were left, I re-wrote their statement as: \"NO THING IS TRUE\" They can stick that shiite in their pipe and smoke it. I'm not surprised that I'd get one of these Autumn Dust Children to screw with me a little. As \"Marauders\", we tend to piss in a lot of peoples' cornflakes without even meaning to. By virtue of our very Essence, we erode the very Foundations that so many are addicted to ( I have my little societal addictions too. Internet anyone?). What we do has been called by some \"Petty Terrorism\". OK, I can see their point. I have an open-ended reality system (like most Marauders). Seriously, we do tend to go for the \"Larger than Life\" Effects. We're more at risk of Blowing our own Minds too. Oh well. Let’s talk about Terror for awhile, shall we? You know that I'm grinning like the Friggin Cheshire Cat, Right? My Tactics tend to be rather light as far as \"Terror\" goes. It definitely has its place but I'm not going to use PSIchologickal Catastrophe as a tool without a damn good reason. Because, if you get down to it, our more extreme methods could be called thus. No one need ever suffer any physical threat to be Terrorized. As \"Awakened\" or Illuminated Beings\" (Or, more accurately, those with a broader view of the Terrain) we are above that. If you think about it, the True Goal of a Terrorist is profound change. They want to spread a message and they want to get as many people to feel the effect as possible. They want Media attention. To do this, they cause terror by making people unsure and afraid. You with me? Unfortunately, these assholes all think that they need to use murder as their chief method for doing this. NO!

In the eyes of the world (My World) these people are damaged material and couldn't possibly have a point (even in those cases where originally, the counter-movement had one). Silly fools! Tricks are for Discordians. Is there a point to all this rambling? I don't know... Terror tactics should only be used to make people feel uncertain about things and want to know why things are going wrong. They need to reflect on what's happened and ask \"What the?!?\" Scare them until they crap themselves? YES! This can be done in a fashion that actually causes them to laugh when they realize that they're ok. People have a tendency to do that. If the situation leading up to the Reality Breakdown is strange and ultimately humorous, they'll pick up on any hidden messages you left as clues. Use your Imagination!
