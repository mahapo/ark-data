IT SEEMS EVEN TREND FORECASTERS KNOWwhat it is. Chaos magic is that phase you grow out of where you invokeSuperman and believe whatever you like and mess about with theNecronomicon in your parents’ basement and start a tumblr blog of AustinOsman Spare quotes. What could possibly be served via the publication ofanother chaos magic book?Perhaps nothing.Answering the question properly requires beginning, inevitably, at thebeginning. The common conception of chaos magic –note the spelling and lackof capital letters- formed during what we may call its ‘escape velocity’ phase.This coincided with the heady days of the early internet, Grant Morrison’sInvisibles and the last gasp of progressive trance music. However chaos magicis older than this phase, if only a little.Technically you can –and I do- trace any magical school right back to theemergence of conceptual thinking in humans, the evidence of which is to befound painted in caves and carved on mammoth bones. In such a scenario,pinpointing origins becomes something of an academic pastime. That beingsaid, chaos magic first emerged in 1980s Britain as a reaction against themoribund state of occultism in general, having staggered out of the seventies"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"with malodorous coatings of Castaneda and Ascended Masters layered atop along-stagnant core of Victorian magical order nonsense and tawdry in-fighting.Even its name –as given by the movement’s creator, Peter J Carroll- sayssomething about it that most people have missed. Chaos magic was named forJames Gleick’s book, Chaos, popular at the time, that explored the ontologicalimplications of chaos mathematics, fractals, strange attractors and what theymight mean for our experience of the universe. It was among the first books toexplore specifically data-driven descriptions of reality in the public arena.‘Chaos’ positively defines today’s global geopolitics. Trust in politicians andacademics is at an historic low. Economies are undergoing transitions moresignificant than the industrial revolution. Genetically modified seeds escapeinto the wild and billionaires announce their intention to die on other planets.These are the conditions of reality that present themselves to the singularhuman. The singular human who, for better or for worse –mostly worse, itturns out- trusts and values his own self-centricity above all else. There is anexpectation of immediacy or ease in the spiritual question that has noprecedent in the last 30,000 years of mankind’s journey. Today, nobody toddlesoff to India to sit at the feet of gurus. Or if they do, it is not without a selfie stickso that everyone else knows that it happened.Let us ask a serious question then. Can a radical opposition to grandnarratives and fixed points of truth still exist in a world where they are largelyabsent? Are we fighting a long-won war? Perhaps. Or perhaps we were toohasty in assuming that the opposite of a monoculture was an individualistic one?The number of monthly active users on the top social platforms is measured inthe billions –all expressing their breathless personal opinions of singingprogrammes or mass shootings- and yet there is no vision quite so monolithic asthat of the Facebook newsfeed. We thought that replacing the singular,authoritative voice of the twentieth century newscaster with the digitally-enabled vox populi of the internet would forever change the narrative. All it didwas ruin the spelling. Where is chaos magic in the midst of this?As it got away from its founders, chaos magic came to mean ‘doingwhatever you want’ in popular parlance, which is probably close to the oppositeof its original formulation. In the modern world, ‘doing whatever you want’leads to Type II diabetes and very public bankruptcies. But the supposed"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"freedom that chaos magic offers -the apple in its garden- is a stark one. Chaosmagic is not ‘doing whatever you want’, it is ‘trialling a lot of things andretaining those that work’. It is entirely unforgiving of failure or –morespecifically- excuses for failure. Chaos magic lacks any certificates ofparticipation. You achieve what you set out to do or you have failed. Successcould be lasting apotheosis or it could be bedding your secretary. This onlylooks like elitism to failures. To scientists, it looks like science.Here we find, then, chaos magic’s true iconoclasm. Not in the destruction ofsacred images but in the destruction of excuses, of fudges and self-delusions. Itattacks the column of esotericism at its unseemly weak spots. Chaos magic isalways the pirates to the Victorian orders’ Royal Navy. And like the pirates ofthe Golden Age, its existence improves both itself and those it preys upon.Freedom came faster to the fringes of the Caribbean because of piracy and, atthe same time, the Royal Navy was forced into centuries-long martialuntouchability in order to counter it. Even today’s modern shipping lanes tracethe path that was formed as a result of Golden Age piracy. The westerntradition is similarly vastly improved for its tangle with vigorous iconoclasm.The formation of the Golden Dawn occurred in the city that led the worldin scientific discovery, culture, technology and mysticism just as London’sglobal power was peaking. As best it could, the order amalgamated the cuttingedge of each of these fields and packaged it in such a way that appealed to theright sort of people and made the wrong sort clutch their pearls and gasp. Chaosmagic formed in the same city just as that global power was completing itsunwinding, just as the last few drops were being shaken from the bottle. But itdid, and does, retain a similar coalescence of culture, science, technology andmysticism that was so crucial to the creation of its Victorian predecessor. Themistake too many make is to assume that the mid-eighties/early-ninetiesamalgam was definitive. It isn’t. Just as the Golden Dawn required updating –better seventy years late than never- so it is that chaos magic requires areformulation, an update, lest it relegate itself to the same fate as the orders;weekend ‘open rituals’ in rented scout halls on the outskirts of faded, post-industrial, Midlands towns.To the opening question, then. Does chaos magic still exist? I believe it does.But I also believe it is in need of a minor correction, or at least, a mischievous"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"warp to bring it into alignment with the twenty first century. There would belittle served by going over the core principles of previous decades as these arelargely known or readily accessible online. For brevity and convenience, theyare listed below:1. A preference for observed magical results over unfounded claimsof mystical insight.2. An awareness of the capacity of personal beliefs to shape theexperiences of those that hold them.3. A virulent suspicion of mystical, political and scientific authority.4. Probabilistic or random interpretations of events are prioritised overmystical or spiritual ones.5. A fierce iconoclasm when it comes to the rules and taboos ofwestern magic.6. A realisation that quality fiction sometimes provides equal or betterinterpretive models given that artists have proved to be morereliable narrators than either scientists or wizards.7. A lifelong dedication to the study of the history of ideas and magicand a recognition that this study is one of the most expedient routesto apotheosis.8. Having money is generally better than not having money,particularly for those who claim to command the forces of theuniverse, and so economic literacy is also valued.Instead of rehashing them, we reassert them here. Chaos magic does notneed new things added to it. It does not need a ‘Reformation’. What it needs is aCounter-Reformation -a return to core principles and an examination of whatthey might look like in the modern era. Pieces of Eight presents a series of briefessays in chaos magic apologetics, followed by an only-seemingly randomcollection of practical magical rituals and enchantments, all in a probably-futile attempt to dropkick the discourse into the twenty first century.As a youngster I was terribly struck by Crowley’s comment that themagician’s ‘true’ magical circle, built over time, is his or her aura.

As with so many statements said in jest, this oneconceals an important truth. With the developed and emerging worlds nowapproaching economic parity, there are no longer the unlimited funds for purescientific discovery that were to be had during the postwar period. The businessof science is now largely devoted to keeping science in business.And business is tough. Across the board, science is experiencing areplicability crisis where even the most basic of experimental results aresuccessfully replicated a little over 25% of the time. The wider world hasbecome aware of the decades-long manipulation of experimental results bymilitary contractors and Big Pharma for profit motives. Throw in academia’sabsurdly primitive idea of ‘discrediting by fiat’ and the western world’s officialreality producing mechanism is revealed to be a totalitarian cult of intolerance,conspiracy, fraud and incompetence that exceeds even Terry Pratchett’swildest imaginings of how schools of wizardry might operate.The situation in physics is, if anything, even worse.

Dark energy and dark matter are placeholder ideasthat violate physicists’ own laws about conservation of energy; around 80% oftheoretical physics is based on string theory that yields no observable or"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"testable results; distant observations of changes in redshift don’t match thepurported timelines of the Big Bang; and –in a supreme violation of Ockham’sRazor- quadrillions of universes are invented out of thin air to banish the verypossibility that subatomic particles only appear when we look at them.The Big Bang hypothesis itself was first proposed by a Catholic priest,George Lemaître, which he described as ‘a Creation-like event’, specificallyreferencing previous myths of the Cosmic Egg. The Pope at the time went onto declare he had ‘proved’ Catholicism. But even this ‘scientific’ hypothesis didnot last long before the mathematics had to be fudged to get the priest-createdarticle of faith to ‘work’: in 1979, it was suggested that the universe underwent aperiod of exponential growth known as ‘inflation’ before slowing back down toits apparent, currently expanding state. The physics behind how this might workare entirely unknown because –stay with me now- they violate everything wedo know about physics. Terence McKenna once famously said that scienceasks “Give us one free miracle and we’ll explain the rest.” That miracle is theinstantaneous arrival of all the laws of nature and all the matter and energy inthe universe, appearing out of nowhere at the moment of the Big Bang, beforegoing on to expand in uneven and unexplained ways.Quite the miracle. Sounds like magic. Bad magic.The whole circus has been utterly broken since the 1930s when thediscovery of quantum mechanics threw a wand-shaped spanner in theworkings of science’s holy grail; a Theory of Everything. A credit to thoseearly quantum theorists is that they quickly saw that any such theory wouldhave to rely on consciousness as a fundamental component of the universe.The rest of physics operated along the ‘shut up and calculate’ path: As long asno one asks us to stop and consider the metaphysical implications of this, wecan go on using these formulae to build academic careers and the occasionalpiece of useful entertainment technology. Or at least, the rest of public physicsworked this way. Science in the twentieth century is largely the story ofstealing ideas that may have some strategic military value and whisking themaway into black projects where they are then fed on unlimited funding fordecades, the results of which occasionally show in up in the real world asbuildings turning to dust mid-air, gnomic pronouncements from Russian primeministers, planet-wide surveillance systems running off your own phone’s"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"battery or Raytheon-branded flying saucers buzzing hiking groups in nationalparks.For the magician, competence is required not only in science’s theories orbelief systems but also in its inextricably entwined politics. It is the onlycompeting school of wizardry you need have any concern over. Here then, isthe ‘school’ as described by Rupert Sheldrake in his excellent The ScienceDelusion:Contemporary science is based on the claim that all reality ismaterial or physical. There is no reality but material reality.Consciousness is a by-product of the physical activity of the brain.Matter is unconscious. Evolution is purposeless. God exists only asan idea in human minds, and hence in human heads. These beliefsare powerful, not because most scientists think about themcritically but because they don’t. The facts of science are realenough; so are the techniques that scientists use, and thetechnologies based on them. But the belief system that governsconventional scientific thinking is an act of faith, grounded in anineteenth-century ideology.Rather than re-admit the wyrd, the last fifty or so years of science have seenan unprecedented doubling down on unverified beliefs and evidence-freeassumptions. Materialism, it must be understood, is a premise of science, not afinding. That premise is defended above all else. Science as a method ofenquiry has been captured by this embarrassingly naïve belief system. Itdeserves better and so do we. And there are indeed fresh reasons for hope.Like the subatomic particles that so disrupt the model, science’s ideology is onlyreally ‘there’ if you look at it. Look away and it smears back into thousands ofindividual scientists.

String theory is widely considered ‘the onlygame in town’ when it comes to cosmology yet it has not made a single testableprediction about the universe. Ever. This has led some string theorists to suggestthat if a theory is ‘elegant’ and ‘explanatory’ enough, it need not be testedexperimentally! To put it another way, scientists’ science no longer needs to bescientific but you should still listen to them when they tell you what is true andwhat is not. And these are the guys telling us magic is irrational?It used to be that magicians would play a defensive game against ScientificMaterialism, scurrying away from the Sauron eye-beams of supposedRationalism. We hid first with the priests, claiming that science only explainsthe physical while magic is of God. Then we hid in the truth of science’sadolescence: it had yet to explain magic. Then we hid in the mind, claiming ‘it’sjust psychology’ as our cover. The time has come to play an offensive game.Turn and face these fools. Magic is real and Materialism is fraud. We mustcrush the material of Materialism into dust for our philtres and phylacteries.We must never cede the ground of truth to these clowns. NASA’s EmDriveviolates the Second Law of Motion, nevertheless it is being built and the SecondLaw is still being taught. This is the kind of idiocy that stands opposed to us. Youcould knock it over with one breath, even if the mallet is far more satisfying.As is clear, the collapse in the credibility of Materialism is no excuse toneglect your personal scientific education. Uninformed magicians will oftenpoint to their propensity to occasionally use commercial air travel or theirownership of a mobile phone contract as some sort of evidence they are ‘pro’science (when in both cases this actually means they are ‘pro’ black budgetmilitary spending). This is to confuse consumer technology with cosmology.Every wizard needs to build rather than rent a metaphysics. And such ametaphysics needs to not only improve the success of your practicalenchantments but also allow you to interrogate reality in an increasinglysophisticated way.

It was then that Italian artists, using banker financing, tookadvantage of the collapse of Byzantium to regain access to some of the mostimportant texts of the classical world. This callous opportunism must rank asone of the most profitable ever acts of war salvage. In the courts and librariesof Florence and Venice, science and magic were inextricable, united in the oneontological goal: the description of the true functioning of the natural universeand how we may participate and find meaning in it. With the benefit ofhindsight, this marriage was probably a few centuries before its time, arrivingas it did before empiricism and data-backed observations properly came ofage.The noble goal of unifying observations of the universe with an improvedview of spirit’s role within it needs to be reinvigorated. It is only an accident ofhistory that split these two camps, and one that favours Scientific Materialism alot more than it deserves. Several fruitful lines of enquiry for doing preciselythat will be explored in subsequent chapters.Do not neglect science.

And the siegeengines we bring to this front are quite out of date. Recourse to millennia-oldsacred texts from the other side of the world is an especially Victorianapproach, one aimed more at re-enchanting existing modes of westernspirituality than demolishing Materialism, which is today’s urgent goal.As we saw in the previous chapter, the world has given Materialism acouple of centuries to come up with some form of coherence that wouldnecessitate us taking it seriously and it has utterly failed. So, rather than takingthe tired, racially-problematic road of marshalling the ‘wisdom’ of the‘enlightened Easterner’ in our defence, it is deemed more effective to usescience’s actual findings against its lack of them. And so we shall make our waythrough the various extant models that purport to explain consciousness beforesuggesting (at least) one that is most suitable for further interrogation by chaosmagicians. This is where the rubber meets the road. Get it right and you willlive a life filled with miracles and wonder.Initial PostulatesThese are drawn from a recent paper published by Dr Bernardo Kastrup, one"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"of the leading modern lights of the Idealist worldview, entitled On why Idealismis superior to Physicalism and Micropsychism:1. There is subjective experience. This is the primary andincontrovertible datum of existence. 2. From [1], there is that which experiences, since experience entailsan experiencer.3. A person’s experiences are private, in the sense that other people donot have direct access to them (under non-magical circumstances).4. Measurable electrochemical activity in a person’s nervous systemcorrelates with the person’s private experiences. 5. Nervous systems have the same essential nature -that is, theybelong to the same ontological class- as the rest of the physicaluniverse. After all, nervous systems are physical systems. They arecomposed of the same types of fundamental subatomic particlesand force fields that make up the universe as a whole.6. We all inhabit the same universe, despite the different points-of-view from which each person observes it and the different ways inwhich each person interacts with it. 7. The universe unfolds according to patterns and regularitiesindependent of our personal volition. In other words, human beingscannot change the laws of nature by wishing them to be different.Or at least not commonly or in predictable ways. (Pro tip: Alwaysleave the door open for a once-every-five-millennia appearance ofa superhuman or demi-god.)Additional PostulatesThe initial postulates are useful for beginning a debate in philosophy class butthis is not a philosophy book, it’s a chaos magic book. As such, there areadditional phenomena –often verified in laboratory settings or via more than acentury’s worth of meta analysed data- that must be folded into an improvedmodel of consciousness. These would include:1. The reality of telepathy: Telepathy is not only regularlydemonstrated, it is actually on the increase in the modern world asmore and more people are using phones. More specifically verified"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"instances of telepathy are on the increase. In previous centuries youwould have no way of knowing if someone was writing you a letterat the very moment you thought of them. (Although there aredozens of famous accounts of letter telepathy, such as thoseexperienced by Mark Twain.)2. Mentally seeing things separated from you by distance and/or timeis both possible and commonly achieved. Again, these have beenregularly and convincingly demonstrated under laboratoryconditions. In the case of remote viewing, accuracy is improvedwhen ‘feedback’ –which is the subsequent confirmation of theviewing target- is received. This needs to be modelled.3. NDEs and UFO phenomena have some sort of discrete reality: It isno longer worth anyone’s time to debate the ‘reality’ of thesephenomena. Buy any would-be detractors a bottle of wine, sit themdown in front of the internet and go out for the evening. As far aspostulates go, the reality of these phenomena needs to beincorporated into a consciousness model, particularly as those whoexperience them very often also experience long-term paranormalor psi effects.MaterialismMaterialism isn’t even very good at describing the material world. When youstop to think about it that really is quite embarrassing. Most of the physicaluniverse is still currently MIA. That would be dark matter and dark energy,which allegedly make up 96% of the whole shebang. But even the 4% thatMaterialists are extremely confident about has no discernible material realitywithout human intervention. Light, for instance, has no brightness until itinteracts with a retina and triggers reactions in the visual cortex. Similarly thereis no sound, no colour, no taste and no smell without this conscious interaction.And this is before we get to the oft-used example of quantum observer effectswhere no observation of reality is complete until a human is involved in theresults.As for the contention that the brain “creates” these experiences –andsomehow emanates consciousness itself- this is entirely without proof. Thebrain is a dark place. It contains no sounds or colours. When viewed with high-"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"end medical devices, the human brain will treat us to a largely unpredictablefireworks show of electrochemical reactions. But so will dead salmon whenyou put them in an MRI. To say these electrical signals are creating experienceis to say that Rihanna lives in your radio. She doesn’t.Few people outside those who work in bars near philosophy faculties realisejust how close to death Materialism really is as a viable worldview. The latestEEG signal to be held up as ‘the signal that creates consciousness inside thebrain’, P3b, has since been detected during unconscious processing. The clue isin the name there. If it is involved in unconscious activity, it cannot be theneural correlate to consciousness.But this has always been Materialism’s problem. It cannot, even just on achalkboard, explain how arrangements of physical molecules can generatesubjective experience. This is the classic ‘hard problem of consciousness’ that isso completely unsolvable in a Materialist paradigm that several of its leadingexponents have resorted to declaring that consciousness –which is provably theonly way to experience reality in the first place- does not even exist.Understanding Materialism’s many failings becomes important not becauseit is a valid metaphysical school –it isn’t- but because it is this very flimsypremise that underpins how modern culture determines and assigns value.Which is probably why they came up with the next model we will examine.Panpsychism. Materialism’s last stand. Now with added sparkle power.PanpsychismIf Materialism can be described as ‘molecules somehow learned to think’, thenPanpsychism can be described as ‘thinking is a property of matter similar tomass or charge and if you Lego block them together they somehow learn tothink.’What may look at first glance like science’s attempt to re-enchant the worldby granting it the same sort of magical status the human mind enjoys is in factthe exact opposite. Once again with zero supporting evidence, it is a smearingof the miracle of the human mind out over the physical universe until neitherlook miraculous. But it is like trying to spread restaurant butter. All you do is"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"mess up the bread. The butter remains undamaged and inexplicable. (Science’sother hard problem.)The shortcomings of Panpsychism are essentially the same shortcomingsas materialism, just phrased slightly differently. It is a rear-guard action hastilyassembled to defend the dominant paradigm. Dr Kastrup points out in the paperreferenced above that there are actually two versions of Panpsychism itsproponents like to shift between:1. Consciousness is just another irreducible property of subatomicparticles, similar to spin or charge. OR2. Consciousness is matter’s intrinsic property. Each particle is a tinyfragment of consciousness and if you compile enough of themtogether you will get ‘human’ or ‘octopus’ or ‘camel’ consciousness.More complex combinations of particles lead to higher orders ofsubjective experience such as fremdschämen, anxiety over publicspeaking or the desire to watch uncommon and very specificpornography.Both of these variants have the same problems. Firstly, smearingconsciousness out is not so much an explanation but a fudge to allow thespotlight to remain on the physical. You are still left with the challenge ofmolecules having inner experiences except that this time it is saying that thecomplexity of their arrangement somehow magically creates them. There isno evidence for this. From the perspective of a philosophical debate, you cango so far as to say there is zero evidence of consciousness in inanimate objectsat any scale. From a magical perspective this is somewhat arguable –mostmagicians would concede that inanimate objects at least can be ‘ensouled’. Butthat ‘ensoulment’ speaks to a wider worldview failure in Panpsychism: aninability to model paranormal phenomena that are devoid of complexarrangements of molecules –such as spirit encounters and after deathcommunication.Panpsychism appears designed to kick the Materialist physics can down theroad a bit further, presumably until such time as its current exponents haveretired on full salary from their tenured positions. The hard problem remains."},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"IdealismIf Panpsychism is ‘matter generates consciousness’ then Idealism, grosslysimplifying down its myriad forms, is ‘consciousness generates matter’. This iscommonly and sometimes deliberately misunderstood as meaning yourconsciousness creates the entire universe. In its most erudite form, Idealismsays a consciousness or consciousness field –of which your own consciousnessis a tiny, often temporary fragment- creates the entire universe.It is a much more defensible position than either Materialism orPanpsychism because it ‘solves’ the hard problem of consciousness bydeclaring both its existence and its primacy. Conscious experience is the onlyway reality can be known. Whereas the previous worldviews have zero piecesof evidence going for it, Idealism has one. It also at least leaves the door openfor some of those psi effects described in the additional postulates.Reality –both inner and physical- can be likened to vibrations on a singlemembrane of consciousness. You, Kazakhstan, the Pleiades, the French accent,coral reefs, Korean pop music and whatever damn thing your cat alwaysseems to be dreaming about. These are all thoughts in a universal mind.There are reasons to like Idealism without becoming an adherent. The factthat it can so easily disarm and dismantle Materialist paradigms is more thansufficient to know about it in detail. Not only does Idealism have the all-important one piece of evidence -the reality of your consciousness- but it canalso win the argument based solely on Ockham’s Razor: Do not multiplyunnecessarily. Technically, Materialism posits an entire universe for which ithas no evidence and can never derive any: the physical world outside of yourconscious experience. Quite the violation when you stop to think about it.Inevitably, Idealism has some shortcomings or else the chapter would stopright here. These are particularly apparent when viewed from a magicalperspective. Many of them are not necessarily the shortcomings of Idealismper se as much as they are shortcomings in human language –in this caseEnglish. It is a poor tool for the job we give it but it is the only one to hand. (Youreally do not want me to try and speak Franglais at you. Be assured, not even aMaterialist deserves that.)Firstly, there has been a recent trend to frame the human mind’s"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"relationship with Mind in medicalised terms. Our inability to consciouslyexperience this distributed universal mind is likened to Dissociative IdentityDisorder. This is a westernised version of an eastern Idealist perspective thatthe illusion of reality needs to be overcome with some sort of dissolution orenlightenment. It is a reasonable allegory but a ‘disordered by design’ universedoes not have a lot of currency in western magical traditions. Viewed from astrictly utilitarian analysis, Near Eastern and European religions accomplishsocial control through tribal rules around sin and taboo by internalising theuniverse’s error (Eve’s sin, for instance) and exclusively offering the cure. Amore South Asian manifestation of religion-based social control requirespathologising individuality and promoting its dissolution. One is no better thanthe other –a plague on both their houses, frankly- but there is an increased riskof unbalancing your metaphysics if the rest of it otherwise runs along westernlines.Secondly ‘All is Mind’ also increases the risk of falling into an intellectuallylazy Monism. The reality is Idealism is probably ‘true’ in some kind of super-metaphysical, 10,000 foot view of the cosmos and we and everything else arejust eddies or oscillations in the one consciousness field. But this is sort of likesaying the universe explains the universe, and the proposed unity of thisconsciousness field struggles to model lived personal experience on a dailybasis. It is very useful when thinking about the entire universe or the individualhuman but it lacks the nuance required for a magical engagement withanything in between. The famous ‘nitrous oxide philosopher’, William James,wrote of the ‘indfferentism’ that accompanied his drug-induced feelings ofuniversal unity. Witness its inability to encapsulate the life of objects that lack ascientific definition of ‘life’ which, for the magician, includes spirits and holyobjects. You can technically model them with Idealism but you can alsotechnically grow carrots in your car. Approaching these concepts from anidealist perspective voids the universe’s warranty.Moving from the whole universe down to the individual, when you say that‘all is Mind’ in English or Franglais, even when you include every atom in theuniverse in that statement, you imply a prioritisation of the mental over thephysical that also risks unbalancing the more western drive toward (or needfor) mind/body integration. Idealists will tell you that is not at all what theymean when they say ‘all is Mind’ –and they would be right- but it does not get"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"us around the realisation that there are probably more effective descriptions.Indeed, none other than Deepak Chopra recently observed that we probablyneed a new term that encompasses mind/matter to not only leapfrog theselinguistic shortcomings but also revivify the exploration for just how thequantum observer effect actually works. Let’s all keep our fingers crossed forDr Chopra then.Many, although not all, of these shortcomings resolve themselves when yousimply replace the word ‘consciousness’ with ‘spirit’. Which brings us to ourfinal bowl of porridge. And it is just right.AnimismIf the western esoteric tradition can be said to have an underlying beliefsystem it is a form of Animism; that the world or the universe is in some sensea living thing. It is found in the original Hermetic texts, it is found in the work ofRenaissance sorcerers such as Campanella and Bruno and it is also found insome of the pivotal esotericists of the last one hundred and fifty years, such asRudolph Steiner and Carl Jung. This particular form of Animism often requiresthe presence of a human consciousness to ‘complete’ or ‘ensoul’ Creation.Writing on Goethe’s worldview, Steiner would say “Man is not there in order toform for himself a picture of the finished world; nay, he himself cooperates inbringing the world into existence.” Standing opposed to the Idealist notion thathuman perception of the universe is in error, Animism requires bringing ourclear perception and imagination to the living, physical world to enrich andmore fully experience it.Going further, it was this very process that ultimately secured humanimmortality for mystics such as Gurdjieff and Jung; it was a process ofdiscovering the immortal self through interaction with the universe, not therealisation that the true self was an error that needed to be dissolved back intothe ultimate consciousness field. Such a cosmology emerges from theincorporation of underlying ‘shamanic’ techniques of active imagination intothe particularly western current of Platonic/Logo-istic/Jesus-ish notion ofrestoration or redemption of the physical via the ‘installation’ of something non-physical."},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"Again, one can make the case that in some sort of ‘ultimate truth’ sense thespirit world and the universal consciousness field are human descriptions of theOne Thing. That may well be correct but ultimate truths sit uneasily withinchaos magic. Models with more operative utility are generally preferred.Perhaps due to its current –and probably doomed- attempts to achieve alevel of respectability within monoculture, Idealism has no small amount ofsqueamishness regarding the reality of spirits, sacred objects and the dead.This makes it considerably less useful to magicians than Animism. Howeveryou conceive of their ‘true’ nature, magic requires full engagement withfetishes and sacred ground and window areas such as crossroads. It also worksbest when you grant agency to objects or entities beyond humanconsciousness, and particularly so with living systems. A good example wouldbe the rise to prominence of ayahuasca outside its natural habitat over the lastcouple of decades. From an Animist perspective she very much looks like aspirit on a mission. It is just such an attitude that underpins the totemicrelationship with plants, stones and animals found in folk magic and witchcraft.Idealism contends that ayahuasca –to continue the example- is in mind, butstops short of granting it a subjective or inner life. It is more useful for themagician to consider living systems not as some unaware little eddies in auniversal consciousness field, but as ‘outposts’ of the spirit world. Such aperspective has the pleasing side effect of making the experience of day-to-day life much richer. Returning to Steiner, Jung and ultimately HermesTrismegistus, it also makes it easier to achieve ‘imaginal co-creation’.The difference in operative utility between Idealism and Animism is at itsmost stark when considering psi effects, after death communication and UFOphenomena. Or really any of the things between heaven and earth that are notoften dreamt of in Idealist philosophy. The magician’s world resists singular,macro explanations.

From the diktats issued from the precisely six owners of allmainstream media to the borderline genocidal ontologies vomited from theivory tower all over impressionable college minds, to the disorderedelectromagnetic landscape of the domestic dwelling, attacks on the ‘essentialyou’ are as constant as they are effective.What has emerged in the last decade or so is how vigorously thesedecohering and depatterning strategies where used by both the Nazis and theAnglo-American shadow state precisely because they were and are soeffective in embedding fear, compliance and submission. None of these arequalities the chaos magician would wish to cultivate. A careful examination ofthe history of these appalling procedures leads to the inevitable conclusion that-on a psychological basis- one is the healthiest number.Over the same intervening time period it has become clear that the oppositeis true on a purely biological basis. Each passing year the human-as-biomegrows ever more prominent. Poor gut bacteria looks like it underlies everythingfrom the obesity crisis to chronic depression, which goes some way toexplaining why there are no silver bullets for any of these conditions.

But today we are actually getting cooler rather thanwarmer in this unavoidable game of Marco Polo, largely thanks to modernmedicine’s obsession with silly transhumanist nonsense that itself rests onentirely unproven assumptions about our bodies’ and brains’ similarities tomachines. We continue to treat symptoms rather than causes when we viewthe body as a machine, even cutting it up to replace parts.

Inflammation. Do everything you can to minimise it on an ongoingbasis.

The miracle powers ofmedicinal cannabis appear to ‘work’ by dramatically improving theendocannabinoid system which itself regulates the human immunesystem. This is probably why it appears to ‘cure’ everything fromcancer to epilepsy. There are any number of immune-boostingfoods you should bump into high rotation on your plates and in yourvegetable patches.3. Nutrition. Where the first and the second point collide. Repeat afterme: I am never not on a detox. Disease is a subtraction from aperfect health state. It is best overcome or prevented via takingcontrol of your nutrition.If you correct for or optimise toward these three indicators, then whateveryour situation or location on the earth, you will be heading in the right direction.Here endeth the spell. I assure you, there is Big Magic in it.And Medicine thy FoodIn the centuries to come, our descendants will laugh at our medical andnutritional advice the way we laughed at the advice given to Henry VIII, whodied morbidly obese. High carbohydrate diets were a disaster. Lowfat/artificial sweetener diets were a disaster. High protein high fat diets wereless of a disaster but still no magic bullet. Now we find ourselves in a situationwhere organisations such as the Mayo Clinic and the Academy of Nutritionand Dietetics assert that saturated fats are not in any way the cause of weightgain or poor heart health. Nevertheless, whole milk is still banned in mostschools, in favour of high sugar ‘low fat’ alternatives. All those ‘this food linkedto that’ studies are probably completely wrong.

In acompellingly Animist way, the positive mental health effects are increased ifthe physical exercise occurs in a natural setting. Recent studies from CityUniversity of New York even suggest that there is no difference in calorie usebetween humans with moderate activity levels –walking, taking the stairs, gymonce a week- and full-blown gym buddies. University of York in Torontoresearch shows that it was easier to lose weight in the 70s and 80s than today,even with identical levels of calorie consumption and physical activity. We spysome mystical advice in amongst the undergrowth of all these studies: Live anactive life closer to nature and you will be physically and psychologicallyhealthy. Team Animism wins again.Returning to the ecosystemic self, it is becoming clear that the five decadeassault on your gut bacteria –called by some your ‘second brain’- is the linkingfactor between the rise of diabetes, heart disease and the obesity epidemic. Sonot only was it easier to lose weight thirty years ago, people who grew up inthose decades appear to have microbiomes that are better at metabolising foodthan younger generations. The diversity of gut bacteria today is 30% lowerthan it was fifty years ago. Do not reach for the Quarter Pounder just yet. It isvia the microbiomal route that modern fast foods are actually killing us.Typically your gut contains 3,500 different bacterial species, weighing in atapproximately three pounds. Tests involving subjects eating a ten-day diet offast foods reduced this diversity by 1,300 whole species! This genocide leads toan invasion of harmful microbes -opportunistic pathogens called bacteriodetes-that inhibit metabolism and cause a cascade of health problems (associatedwith inflammation and reduced immunity, hence the ‘spell’ on the previouspages).This is all before we get to the overuse of antibiotics in a medical and foodproduction setting. Antibiotics, you will recall, are specifically designed todestroy bacteria. And indeed, our obesity crisis has now jumped to farmanimals and pets, who are not typically found Netfilx and chilling with Doritosin the wild.

The reality is we have beendegrading the soil biome for more than a century while simultaneouslyspraying our foodstuffs with chemicals whose only purpose is to kill things. Themicrobial soil food web that previously converted nutrients from the earth intoour food is gone and in most of the western world, will stay gone.You would think that with the case for nutrition being the factor in thediseases and chronic conditions that are killing us being so open and shut thatmodern medical practice and education would be doubling down on it. Nope.In fact, the number of hours devoted to nutrition in medical curricula hasactually decreased from 21 hours in 1985 to 19 hours today. Over four years atschool.

It was not someclumsy hijack of local gods by a new power elite. There is some Deep Magicwaiting to be excavated here.For instance, prior to the church’s centralisation, it fell to individual Christianfamilies to care for their dead. Very often they were buried beside Jews orPagans. Heads of households would perform rites and ensure graves weretended. Initially, in both Rome and Byzantium, it was not even clear whetherChristian souls were still active after death or whether they just slept until theEnd Time. Families in Western Ireland or Northern France could not wait thatlong. From this uneven ground rose the ghostly forms of local saints and thecontinuance of local culture heroes. We must remember that for the people ofthis time, the sky was far from empty. The saints were just one class of beingthat connected backward to the daimones of the Classical World and forward tothe presiding angels and spirits of their current one. This cosmos was a muchlarger space than we typically occupy today, and mankind’s role in it was smallby comparison. When the church finally got around to putting a word on it,‘intercession’ was too weak.

They got down in there. They were deeplyimmanent presences. Their touch caused human bodies to retaintheir original, natural integrity. The heavy scent of paradise waftedfrom their tombs. Great trees planted beside their tombsblossomed. The description by Gregory of Tours of the shrine ofSaint Eulalia in Mérida reveals the slow change by which the saintscame back to earth. Gregory summarises the verses of Prudentiuswritten around the year 400... [He] had written of how the soul ofEulalia had left her mouth to fly like a radiant, white dove, up to thestars. It is a moment of apotheosis, of entry into the starry heavens.The coarse earth was left far behind, as had been the case withheroes, divinized emperors and wise men in the pagan world.By the time Gregory of Tours was recounting the stories, three large treesstood by Eulalia’s tomb.

Secondly,his folkloric status as ‘bishop of the graveyard’ allows St Cyprian to performdouble necromantic duties as both a psychopomp and a ‘stand in’ for certaingrimoire rites that require the captured soul of a dead person (typically acriminal) that is used to bring in another spirit being such as a Sibyl.Then there is his patronage of magic books themselves.

The grimoires themselves are not the western magical tradition,rather they are the archaeological evidence that one existed at all levels ofsociety, even if its expression differed on a class basis.I sometimes joke with Geraldine Beskin of London’s Atlantis Bookshop thatwhat is needed is a sort of Dorling Kindersley Guide to the World of theGrimoires: hapless stock photo actors in simple reconstructed clothing, 3Dcutaway diagrams of buildings, and so on, showing what they wore, what theyate, what their economy was like.

When youknow that olive oil was used in lamps certain divinatory rites in theHygomanteia become clear. When you know where pine kernels wereimported from, the Lady of the Mountain operation makes more sense, and soon.

The implication is that this deep structure worksbetter than any other, at least for the families of spirits that have come down tous. Rigid adherence is mercifully unwarranted, however, which is good newsfor readers who enjoy having sex more than once a month or do not haveaccess to small children to take into the woods to act as scryers.There is no substitute for discretion and experimentation in the formulationof your own spirit procedures. For my money, the western magical tradition"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"begins and ends with that statement.If I am permitted one observation, it would seem to me an under-utilisedcomponent of this deep ritual structure is assuming the specific authority of ‘themagician archetype’ from within the context of the grimoire being used.Typically this is Moses or Solomon, names all-too-frequently abandoned bymodern magicians. The ‘form’ of assuming the authority of a more powerfulbeing and using said authority to summon a lesser spirit is certainly far olderthan Solomonic magic. But there is a ‘sum greater than its parts’ effect of usingthese names rather than ones that may be more amenable to your preferredesoteric tradition, as these are the names by which these spirits are called. Dotry to meet them halfway. Lon Milo DuQuette, referring specifically toEnochian magic, likens it to speaking French to your waiter in Paris. Once youhave made a little effort, your waiter will switch to English. (If only to save hisears from your mangling of his beautiful language!) Such courtesy shouldextend beyond the use of language to other ritual activity. Magic is, if anything,extradimensional diplomacy.A Brief Note on AbramelinThrough an accident of history, The Book of the Sacred Magic of Abra-Melinthe Mage has probably been over-emphasised and inaccurately contextualisedfor most of the last hundred or so years. As with so many texts and influenceson the Victorian magical renaissance, much of it was down to the documentsavailable for translation and the order in which they were translated. Insightsfrom these piecemeal translation efforts were then hastily assembled into thelesson plans associated with the quasi-Masonic degree structure of the orders inquestion. Not that we should appear ungrateful. The best thing our magicalancestors did for us was spend their own time, effort and money bringing thesetexts out of academia and into the light of modern practice, even if some oftheir initial translations have not stood the test of time.The Abramelin operation describes a six-month (to 18 month) process,which culminates in the magician making contact with his/her Holy GuardianAngel. Mathers liked it because he believed he had finally found a grimoire of‘pure’ Kaballistic magic largely free of the contamination –and odious demons-of other Solomonic texts. Given that it seems probable the operation is a"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"descendant of various Greek and Alexandrian rites to contact one’s‘Supernatural Assistant’, the bed bugs are probably more important thanMathers would have liked, at least as important as the mattress.He may have been even less pleased with the latest historical research.Although the earliest copy of the manuscript dates to 1608, I find myselfcompletely convinced by historian Thomas Hatsis’s contention that the‘sleeping ointment’ provided by the ‘woman of Linz’ –given that the procedurecontains none of the signifiers of witchcraft that arose in later centuries- datesfrom some time in the 1400s and thus provides the tantalising suggestion thatthere really was a continuity of folk pharmakeia beyond the end of theClassical Age.

Telekinesis is of the same order of nature as theHertz rays or the radium emanations. But what nobody before mehas done is to prove the existence of extra-human intelligence, andmy Magical Record does this. I err in the interpretation, of course;but it is impossible to doubt that there is a somebody there, asomebody capable of combining events as a Napoleon forms hisplans of campaign, and possessed of powers unthinkably vast.Cleary Crowley was far from the first to ‘prove’ the existence of theseintelligences. In fact, if you have read my Star.Ships: A Prehistory of theSpirits, you will know I make the case that a goodly chunk of human cultureand technology can be interpreted as ‘proof’ of these intelligences. What wecan say in defence of Crowley’s contribution is that he not only recognised theexistence of a range of beings behind what Dr Jeffrey Kripal calls ‘the one-way mirror’ of observable reality, but that he recognised the masterful skill thatgoes into ‘their’ plans. Anyone with even trifling experience with spirit work willhave seen how they often make their presence, wishes or intentions known viaa string of the most baroque, apparently-acausal, largely-trivial events andcoincidences. For Crowley, this was someone/thing ‘capable of combiningevents as Napoleon forms his plans of campaign’. I’d suggest, however, thatwhile Napoleon’s plans were certainly complex, the plans of whatever isbehind these phenomena appear almost overly so.Crowley exemplifies the peculiarities of engaging with these phenomenabetter than even he knew, given his subsequent oblique influence on thetwentieth century’s space programme and popular culture. In fact, it appearsone of the tell-tale signs of extradimensional contact is the way certainunderstandings come down to us ‘out of sequence’, so to speak.Awareness of these external agencies dates back as far as we can see in thehistorical record. For most of history they were the menagerie of spirits,faeries, demons and other things that go bump in the night. In the west, theyhad largely become ‘mere’ folklore by the time the space race began inearnest, whereupon these phenomena were interpreted as physical visitorsfrom other planets -a mistake used to tremendous propaganda effect during the"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"heady days of the Cold War. Then a combination of psi research, astronomyand improved religious studies gave us back the idea that we are dealing withsomething extremely strange, probably quite dangerous and definitely long-lived. Something which seems intimately related to and extremely interested inthe ‘shape’ of our beliefs.And then there’s poor old magic, running to catch up to the Deep State afterhalf a century of unlimited black budget money spent attempting weaponisewhat appears to be a critical component of Reality with a capital ‘R’. We shouldrun a little faster. Wizards have been intimately involved in spy craft andpower games for centuries, probably millennia. We may even have somethingto offer, if only we were to stop tripping over our own silly little beliefs alongthe way. Theoretically, magic is best positioned for an experience of the sacredas alien; as what Rudolph Otto called the ‘numinous’, described below in DrJeffrey Kripal and Whitely Strieber’s The Super Natural:Otto went to great lengths, mostly with biblical materials, to showthat this numinous energy or alien presence might be experiencedas positive or negative, or both at the same time. The numinousmight in fact invoke a whole range of physiological, emotional, andspiritual responses: dread and foreboding, awe and mystery,eeriness, terror, reverence and worship, even ecstasy and mysticalunion. The angel is an expression of the numinous, but so too is thedemon. Otto was very much a follower of Kant. He did not thinkthat human beings generally have any direct access to thenuminous presence as it really and truly is. He thought rather thatthis mystical presence is always filtered through and shaped by thecategories of the human mind and the cultures that largelydetermine its functioning. Dr Kripal reminds us that Biblical encounters with God often result in the deathof the seeker. Widening the sacred out beyond that which is ‘nice’ very muchsits inside the magician’s circle. Not just the numinous, but also the deceptive"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"caprice of these experiences suggest we are dealing with differing subsets ofthe same phenomena. In The Super Natural, Strieber describes interviewingpeople local to his famous Communion encounter in upstate New York in themonths that followed it. A carpenter, finishing a house near the Strieber cabin,was sleeping in the worksite when he was awoken by a short, dark humanoid -who instilled terror in the tradesman- before transforming into a bird ofparadise and vanishing. Visitors to the Strieber cabin encountered what aredescribed as kobolds that morphed into spectral humanoids and fled towardDelaware Peoples gravesites on the property before also vanishing. Indeed, the‘shape’ of spirit contact in the west is remarkably consistent across time andspace. The apocryphal author of the Great Book of St Cyprian, a monasterylibrarian known as Jonas Sufurino, opens his grimoire with a tale on amountaintop during a storm, where he invokes the Lord of Avernus. The stormresponds to his invocation and from that point on Sufurino is in telepathiccontact with the Devil. It is all very Close Encounters; mountaintops, flashinglights -more so if you throw in the torsion effects that regularly accompanyelectrical storms. The mountain in question is in northern Germany and isknown as Brocken. The site has a long association with witchcraft and isbelieved to have been a location of Odin worship during the reign ofCharlemagne.What magic has to offer for the interested -if slightly foolhardy- seeker, isa set of protocols honed from centuries of spirit contact. This is rare in theWest. Let us hypothesise a spectrum of western seekers with entheogen fans atone end and competent paranormalists such as Jacques Vallée or George PHansen at the other. At the entheogenic end, people are often far too credulousin believing the messages they receive. An example would be AndrijaPuharich and Uri Geller’s repeated failed predictions for saucer landings basedon information their ‘received’ from a super-computer communicating withthem from the future. At the paranormalist end, Jacques Vallée once famouslyremarked “just because a message comes from Heaven doesn’t mean it’s notstupid.” Hansen, in his The Trickster and the Paranormal, warns –accuratelyenough- of the life disasters that befall paranormal researchers when engagingwith these phenomena. One end accepts too much, the other end accepts toolittle, and there in the middle is the western magical tradition exemplified bythe experiments of John Dee and Edward Kelley, or Aleister Crowley andVictor Neuberg."},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"When it functions correctly, magic has its own sets of protocols forverifying and interrogating these messages -as well as providing highlynecessary systems of protection. Mastery of these protocols provided Crowleywith his greatest revelation: Contact with these beings is essential for thedevelopment of mankind. I would modify the revelation slightly to remove‘development’, in favour of ‘change over time’ or ‘hopefully benignmanipulation’.This process is an update of the archetypal shamanic journey and his orher ongoing role for the tribe: seeking out these beings, trafficking with them forpersonal or tribal gain and generally just avoiding their ire. I would suggest thatongoing interaction with the spirit world is a naturally occurring, entirelynormal, component of human existence. If that is indeed the case, then theneed to elevate Animism to the Big Worldview Table is only increased.This Used to Be a Bad NeighbourhoodSometimes it might be aliens though, yeah? Probably not in the way you think.The trouble with the Mankind’s-gods-are-UFOs hypothesis is that while there isample good evidence that the world’s mythologies have recorded possible‘alien visitations’, there is not much evidence to suggest these visitations triggerthe creation of new religions. Instead, they seem to be absorbed into theexisting worldview. Fátima, the stories of Bishop Agobard, Chinese dragonlegends, some of the descriptions of vimanas. If any of these are memories of‘alien visitations’, then they certainly add complexity to the local beliefsystems, but do not replace them. Even the famous –and regularlymisunderstood- cargo cults were not replacements; they were additions to alocal Animist belief system.More interesting is the growing consensus around how life arrived on thisplanet in the first place: via directed panspermia.

Today’s magicians often havetoo little experience with either power or wealth to have formed a workablemap for navigating how the casino works and who are the real croupiers. Thiswas not always the case. John Dee is largely responsible for putting the idea ofa British Empire in Elizabeth I’s head. The Hermetic underground arose as aresult of the political machinations of the Counter-Reformation and centralEurope’s changing landscape; ‘taking dark’ their plans for universal educationand the elevation of individual liberty. And before all of these were the magicaltin-foil hatters par excellence, the Gnostics.In the words of the “grandfather of Gnostic Studies”, Hans Jonas, the rise ofthe Gnostics ‘is the first time in history that the radical ontological difference ofman and nature has been discovered and the powerfully moving experience ofit given expression in teachings strange and suggestive. The rift between manand nature was never to close again.’Eighty years of scholarly confusion surrounds what the Gnostics meant by‘nature’ in this context.

Gnosticism may rightly be described as analien religion in that it explores mankind’s cosmic alienation; the belief that thisis not all there is to life or to being a human.This collection of movements arose during a reactionary and rebellioustime. The religious institutions of the eastern Mediterranean had little to offer.The Empire was corrupt and lacked any local participation. Some kind ofcosmic apocalypse –typically an extreme climate event- was expected anyday. Gnosticism was a mystic attempt to explore and catalogue these forces ofoppression, stretching from the outer bounds of the stars down to the localmagistrate; how they arose and what one should do about them. Theirprescription to this cosmic malady was a mystic one, complete with freaky sexplay and liberal use of entheogens. (Still waiting for my invite to that party.)Because of this mystic solve, it is rather like trying to separate theingredients of a bouillabaisse when pulling apart how the Gnostics saw theworld, what was metaphor and what was political reaction. Consider how theJews exiled to Alexandria would have thought of Hadrian, a man who declaredhimself a living god, levelled the Temple Mount and banned them fromJerusalem. As Tobias Churton points out in Gnostic Mysteries of Sex, one of themany names given to the false god who created the physical world was Saklas,meaning Fool, ‘in the sense of a tragicomic stage impressionist, impersonatinga Being beyond him and his comprehension. Like the man who identifies hissoul with his ego, he just gets in the way.’It is a curious twist of fate –one that leads to the unavoidable conclusion thatsomething wyrd is happening in imperceptible realms- that the greatest trancheof Gnostic texts was discovered the same year that the vast infrastructure ofthe shadow state began its enormous build out. Lost for one and a halfmillennia, the Nag Hammadi texts were discovered in 1945, the final year ofWorld War II. It was off to the races for all the black projects, spy games,surveillance technology and the other mechanisms of control we nowexperience after that.

The word derives from the Proto-Indo-European term for gaping, or yawning, as in an opening mouth, a primalscream issuing from behind ancient teeth.For those of you who have read my Star.Ships: A Prehistory of the Spiritsor, even better, Dr Witzel’s The Origins of the World’s Mythologies, chaos is thatwhich is formed by the separation of the Sky Father from the Earth Mother –the cornerstone piece of the 30,000 year old Laurasian cosmology. Thisgap/gape/yawn known as chaos allowed the creation of all life and light in theuniverse. It is built of it.TiamatObtaining a clear picture of the earliest Sumerian cosmology is currently, andmay always be, impossible. The Epic of Creation, which describes Marduk’sdefeat of the great chaos dragon, Tiamat, is not the oldest, but it is reasonable tosuggest that some of its mythemes are dramatically older than the firstappearance of the tablets upon which the tale is written. Firstly, Mardukassumed many of the stories and attributes of earlier gods when he rose to"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"political prominence. Secondly, the ‘creation of the universe out of the corpseof a dismembered dragon/monster mother’ mytheme is sufficientlywidespread to suggest a very early date of conception. Finally, the whole storyappears to be, at least in part, about local struggles for succession among therulers of the various city states, with Tiamat representing older regimes andMarduk representing the seizing of legitimacy by force. (You will find onYouTube a presentation I gave in Glastonbury called An Archaeology ofDragons that explores this topic in considerable depth, should you beinterested.)Tiamat is thus not only the vastly ancient dragon mother of the gods, she isalso the mother of demons and magic and the source of divine authority. InTablet III of the Epic of Creation, an emissary is despatched to the court of thegods who would make war against Tiamat, describing her plans:Tiamat who bore us is rejecting us! She has convened a counciland is raging out of control.The gods have turned to her, all of them, even those you begothave gone over to her side, have crowded round and rallied besideTiamat....Mother Hubur [a title of Tiamat as Sea Monster of Creation],who fashions all things, contributed an unfaceable weapon:She bore giant snakes, sharp of tooth and unsparing of fang.

As for the‘Horned God’ associations, these were preceded by conceptions of the Devil asa serpent, dragon, goat, ram, sea monster and any number of theriomorphs.Studying the ‘barbarous names of evocation’ in the Greek Magical Papyri,the magician learns that different divine names and concepts are moved about,combined and recombined. They can be performed as is to great effect, butthey can also be picked apart and followed along separately to their origin. It isthe same with the Devil. It is a polyvalent, pulsing phenomenon sitting at thevery heart of the western magical tradition. It is encountered via spellwork andexplored via lectio satanas.BaphometThe Devil as he is most commonly encountered by chaos magicians isBaphomet, where he/she offers a very specific form of lectio satanas.Baphomet and the Devil are not functional equivalents. Rather, Baphomet maywell be the most interesting form the Devil has assumed in the past couple ofcenturies, at least in the Old World.The now-familiar iconography by which we best know him/her comes tous via the nineteenth century occultist, Eliphas Lévi. Baphomet is depicted asbi/omnisexual, with a lamp of wisdom between its horns, winged and cloven-hooved, with a mercurial caduceus in its lap, and indicating the Hermeticaxiom of ‘As Above, so Below’ by pointing to the heavens with one hand andthe earth with its other one. Given that Pete Carroll is principally responsiblefor the prominence of Baphomet among chaos magicians, we shall leave it upto him to interpret what Lévi was conveying. From his Epoch: The Esotericon"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"& Portals of Chaos:[I]n one extraordinary image Lévi, the ex-priest and political rebelturned magus, presents to sexually conservative and still fairlyreligious yet increasingly scientific society, a vision of humanaspiration as ‘god of this world’, a figure which encompasses theearliest shamanic conceptions of the life force on earth, paganrepresentations of it as Pan, the monotheist’s denigration of it as theDevil, and the ever present but often hidden ideal of Humanity (ofboth sexes) in pursuit of promethean and luciferic enlightenments.For the modern magician, Baphomet is a symbol bomb. Meditation on andexamination of Lévi’s image brings into focus the vast majority of thecontemporary western esoteric system. But push on that door just a little bitharder and it swings open to reveal centuries of ambition, conspiracy,extradimensional phenomena and quests that may ultimately reshape what weknow about world history.Lévi picked the word up from some of the accusations made against theTemplars during their trial. Scholarly consensus –a category I typicallyconsider has as much intellectual weight as a flock of chickens in athunderstorm- tells us that the accusations of worship of ‘Baphomet’ levelled atthe Templars probably derives from a mis-rendering of ‘Mohammet’ ratherthan the more esoteric ‘baph-metis’ or ‘wisdom baptism’. Be that as it may,from a lectio satanas perspective, drawing a line back to the Templars drops us,once again, right at the sweet spot between terrestrial and spiritual power, rightback to the Reality of the Rulers.The Templars were the world’s first transnational legal entity, whose solepurpose was military in nature, whose funds and fundraising were entirely outof the hands of local dukes and kings.

Not that they’d havebeen able to see these unprotected pilgrims given they spent all their timedigging under the Temple Mount. (For reasons that have never beensatisfactorily explained.)The rise and rise of the Templars occurred simultaneously with the equallymysterious Gothic Cathedral building project and the first stirrings of theClassical World in Europe for five centuries, arriving via the Islamic vectors ofNorman Sicily and Moorish Spain. It was the Moorish route in particular thatgave the Continent –and thus the western magical tradition- the marvelloustroubadour current and, in particular, the Grail Romance. Most famous amongthe troubadour-derived tales is Eschenbach’s masterpiece, Parzival, written inthe opening years of the thirteenth century. Eschenbach claimed he receivedthe story from a troubador named Kyot of Provence, who had in turn found it,written in Arabic, in the work of a Jewish astrologer named Flegetanis.Flegetanis encountered this tale in the Moorish magico-intellectual hothouse ofToledo. He told the story of a war in heaven, a war between the angels, withLucifer -the Light Bringer- as its hero. During his defeat and fall from heaven,a stone fell from either his crown or his forehead (third eye) and became theGrail. This Grail, “whose name” Flegetanis “had read in the constellations”was no cup, but a green or emerald stone, called lapsit exillis.With the benefit of eight centuries of hindsight, it is fairly clear the earliestGrail stories are about the survival and re-introduction of Hermetic wisdom –the knowledge of the stars and how we return to them- and this knowledge isassociated with Lucifer. Thus, given all the Templars’ strange excavations in theHoly Land and Egypt, we can never definitively rule out that at least some ofthem were not messing around with magic. As a result, for modernpractitioners, Baphomet becomes a particularly marvellous stand-in for thewhole process of re-enchanting the west.One final note. It is interesting to ponder on the prominence of St John theBaptist among the Poor Knights, leading some to suggest they were secretadherents of the Johannite Heresy; the belief that St John was the ‘true’Messiah. There is another synchromystical possibility. St John the Baptist andLucifer both shared a name.Morningstar."},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"The Breaking of the WorldThere is the tantalising promise of some sort of infinite treasure dangled at theend of lectio satanas. During his long investigations into the origins of theworld’s mythologies, Dr Witzel created what he calls Pan-Gaean Mythology, aspeculative construction of mankind’s first ever cosmology, based on thedistribution of various mythemes across the world. At a time depth of between150,000 and 65,000 years ago, he speculated that mankind believed in a distantcreator god who had long-departed earth. At some stage this creator god sentdown a Trickster emissary from the sky to teach mankind culture andtechnology. This is either in response to humans violating a taboo, or wesubsequently violate one using the skills we have learned from this emissary.Dr Witzel goes further –and I think he is right to do so- in suggesting thisTrickster may have been a serpent. Snake, taboo, reception of knowledge notmeant for mankind. It’s starting to sound faintly familiar, yes?If we look for the most likely stellar phenomena to be associated with thistale, it would be the appearance of Venus in the pre-dawn sky. It would be theMorningstar who first taught mankind. This suggests that what we consider alargely Near-Eastern belief -that it was the demons, Nephilim, Watchers, etcwho taught mankind writing and metallurgy and so on- may in fact be anextremely old and more universal survival.It also suggests it may be time to give the Devil his dues.

These chimeras all exist on the storytelling spectrum.They describe ways mankind -all of mankind- tells stories about ourselves. In aprevious book, Star.Ships: A Prehistory of the Spirits, I rely on the work ofmythologist, Dr Wendy Doniger, to open up and reclaim the power ofcomparison for a magical audience. Regarding this storytelling spectrum, inThe Implied Spider, she writes:Narrative does not receive raw experience and then impose formon it. Human experience is inherently narrative; this is our primaryway of organizing and giving coherence to our lives. But we cannever give an exact account of our experience, any more than wecan retrieve a dream without any secondary revisions orelaborations.The dream analogy is important and has been compared to mythology since"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"the days typically described in myth. More recently, the titan of twentiethcentury mythological studies, Joseph Campbell said in one of his many publiclectures:Myths are public dreams; dreams are private myths. By findingyour own dream and following it through, it will lead you to themyth-world in which you live. But just as in dream, the subjectand object, though they seem to be separate, are really the same.Mythology has this power because, as Dr Doniger observes, humans constructreality in a narrative fashion. Karen Armstrong, former-nun-turned-public-theologian, turns this observation into advice in A Short History of Mythology:A myth is essentially a guide; it tells us what we must do in order tolive more richly. If we do not apply it to our own situation andmake myth a reality in our own lives, it will remain asincomprehensible and remote as the rules of a board game, whichoften seem confusing and boring until we start to play.A myth then, is not a falsehood, but –to paraphrase Tolkien- a description ofsomething that is in some sense eternal. On my bookshelves are collections ofMaori mythology, First Nations Trickster stories from North America, a fewdozen books on Classical and Near-Eastern mythology, Aboriginal creationmyths and Chinese dragon stories. I fall into none of the cultural or ethnicgroups from which these stories emerged, yet I devour the tales greedily, like awhale eating krill. I do not know what it is to ‘be’ Chinese or Maori.

A white girlwearing a First Nations headdress at a music festival has nothing to do withmagic (and even less to do with good taste).Finding inspiration and joy in the stories of other people is not only anessential component of magic, it is an essential component of being human. Wecan experience the wondrous differences expressed in people across time andspace, but we can also be enriched by those moments of connection, thosemoments when we understand the deeper human components to mythology.Most people know this before they even begin their magical journey. Indeed, itis often the launchpad for it in the first place.You can passionately love the story of the Maori forest god, Tane, withoutdeclaring yourself a Tohunga. Very occasionally you may find some personor group who have taken it too far, who have metaphorically declaredthemselves to be Tohungas. Walk away. There is no surer recipe for madnessthan attempting to correct the whole universe, especially in the digital age.Walk away and remember for as long as there have been magicians andmystics, there have been fraudulent ones. There have been fake fakirs,slippery shamans, manipulative monks and thieving theurgists. A close-knit,local magical community ensures the fraudulent soon seek out their markselsewhere.What you lose by avoiding cultural exploration for fear of appropriation islike visiting a tropical island and refusing to enter the water for fear of sharks.The risk/reward profile is way off balance.

Too often comparison is jettisoned along with ‘appropriation’ thanksin large part to four decades of intellectual pipsqueaks in the academyreceiving tenure for declaring you cannot compare anything to anything else.Wrong. You can and we should, particularly if we are interested in improvingthe efficacy of practical enchantment.In his textbook, Comparing Religions, Dr Kripal provides six guidelines foreffective comparison which must be added to the intellectual armoury of anychaos magician:1. Always keep sameness and difference in some creative orconstructive tension.2. Always be aware of your own perspective as your perspective anddo not confuse it with some universal human position. That is, striveto be as ‘reflexive’ as possible in your comparative practice.3. Comparison works through comparing one religious/spiritualcomplex (A) to another religious/spiritual complex (B) through athird term, concept or experience (C) that derives from your ownenquiry (as in point 2) which need not be found in either A or B.Examples of concepts (C) include sex, death, ghosts, divination, loveor food. While one cannot claim the bodily experience of foodconsumption is experienced the same way in different spiritualcomplexes, but they are indeed experienced.4. A and B should be compared as fairly as possible. This is done byensuring they are roughly at the same level of sophistication orcomplexity when it comes to the concept, C, that you arecomparing. Do not compare Christendom’s Hitler to Hinduism’sGhandi, for instance if you are examining ethical norms andtreatment of social minorities. Similarly, comparing the religiousexperience of orbital space flight between Russian OrthodoxChristianity and Inuit Animism is probably not very useful.(Religious characterisation of space may well be, though.)5. Do not choose a C that privileges the spiritual worldview of A or B.So do not compare the afterlife of Shinto practitioners and NewKingdom Egyptians on whether or not the souls make it through theCourt of Osiris.

It is the ‘little boxes on the hillside’ errorthat infects so much of the western tradition. If it’s not in a grimoiric look-uptable –and more importantly if it’s not in the right field of said look-up table-then it is off the table.Dealing with the former error first: not everything in popular culture can beused in magic because not everything in popular culture is a good story. In fact,most of it isn’t. The Odyssey is not equivalent to a reality TV programmebecause Homer’s narrative tells us something profound, enriching and timelessabout being human. Approached correctly, something like Star Wars can do thesame. In fact, Joseph Campbell considered George Lucas to be his greateststudent. This is what Lucas said to Bill Moyers in a documentary about thegreat mythologist:I’m telling an old myth in a new way... myths help you to findyour own hero’s journey... Everybody has the choice of eitherbeing a hero or not being a hero every day of their lives... It’s not agrand thing. You don’t have to get into a giant laser swordfight orblow up three space ships to become a hero.Telling ‘an old myth in a new way’ is another way of saying that Lucas isstepping into that eternal ‘shape’ that gives mythological narratives their power."},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"Wendy Doniger got the name for her celebrated lecture mentioned above, TheImplied Spider, from considering what this story ‘stuff’ was made of, and whowas ‘spinning’ it:In a... famous essay, [anthropologist Clifford] Geertz speaks ofhumans as animals suspended in webs of significance that theythemselves have spun, webs of culture.[..] This is a usefulmetaphor for the comparatist if we take the spider to be... theshared humanity, the shared life experience that supplies the web-building material, the raw material of narrative to countless humanwebmakers... These human storytellers gather up the strands thatthe spider emits, like silk workers harvesting the cocoons ofsilkworms, to weave their own individual cultural artifacts...

Chaos magic has been indeliblyimprinted with this particular form of spider hunt because it rose to widerprominence during a brief moment of when a golden age of British comicwriters overlapped with the rise of desktop publishing and the early days of theinternet. There were a lot more webs woven through popular culture then. TheInvisibles, Twin Peaks, The X-Files. Those days are not only long gone so thatwe have to look harder for webs, but the webs are now spun through a systemof surveillance, propaganda, political control, manipulation and brainentrainment technology straight out of the nightmares of that very same briefgolden age.So we can still find the spider behind Spiderman, even if it is a little hardernow.

To think this way is tocatastrophically fail at understanding human emotion, consciousness, psieffects, history in general and the history of psychology in particular. There isa fundamental misreading of the impact of Neoplatonism and all its monstrouschildren -such as Descartes and modern Materialism- behind this.Undervaluing the ‘psychological’ only emerges in a culture that haspermanently separated the mind from the matter. We must do better.There is something profound and inextricable in the relationship betweenmythology, psychology and consciousness effects that mean they can neverbe approached separately, however invested one is in a particular view ofthemselves. In the now-famous (and readily available on YouTube) 1988documentary, Joseph Campbell and the Power of Myth, the man himself said:With their discovery that the patterns and logic of fairy tale andmyth correspond to those of dream, the long discredited chimerasof archaic man have returned dramatically to the foreground ofmodern consciousness.Here is where chaos magic departs slightly from Dr Doniger in whether or notthe spider is simply implied. It is probably hugely important that not only domyths follow dream logic, but that engaging with them produces real worldeffects. When Jung was undertaking the dream/myth/symbol work thatbecame is Red Book, he and his family would regularly experience poltergeisteffects in the tower he built on the shore of Lake Zürich.

After decades of ufological research, Dr Jacques Valléecame to the conclusion that the goal of these phenomena was to impact humanculture and mythology, which he describes in his journals as “the mostpowerful force on earth.” If a (presumably non-human) intelligence orintelligences wanted to shape or impact human culture, it would bypass politicsentirely and operate in the realms of dreams and the unconscious. Theproverbial saucer would never land on the White House lawn because it is farmore effective to land in the cultural imagination.And yet this is the field of research many ‘super serious wizards’ think ‘isn’treal magic’! (The good ones grow out of it.) It is fascinating to consider howand where the extradimensional has had an impact without an acknowledgedawareness that it has done so. For this personally important example, in placeof ‘extradimensional’, we shall use ‘Faery’.During a trip to Oxford for an exhibition of magical books at the Bodleianlibrary, I learned that Tolkien’s son, when he was young, would have regularnightmares of a monstrous owl that would appear in his room and peer downon him from the furniture or the foot of the bed. Tolkien named it ‘Owlamoo’,sketched it –the original was in the exhibition- and this “seemed to rob it of itspower” he later recalled.The paranormalists among you will recognise the owl as a defining symbolfor Whitley Strieber’s ‘Visitors’. The association between owls and thesephenomena is extremely long-lived. (I’m writing this chapter in the BritishMuseum members’ room, which sits directly under the famous Queen of theNight plaque from the Old Babylonian period, which depicts agoddess/demoness flanked by two owls.) They are silent, nocturnal, predatorywatchers.

TerenceMcKenna once said that, apart from psychedelics, nothing is as boundary-dissolving as travel. There is no getting around the fact that wizards should haveadventures. It comes with the territory the way feet come with podiatry.As to why adventurism is inherent in magic, that is probably quite a deepquestion. It is perhaps overly deterministic for this readership to suggest it issome sort of inherited deep structure from mankind’s two hundred and fiftythousand year hunter gatherer period (compared to our brisk ten millennia ofsettled agriculture) but there is probably something in there. The reality is ifyou didn’t go adventuring you would starve and die.There is also a deeper, mythic component which may even tantalisinglysuggest something about the structure of reality itself. Most esoteric traditionssettle on the ‘purpose’ of the universe being an experience of itself. Thejourney –the adventure- may well be a microcosmic expression of theuniverse experiencing the universe, rather than sitting at home on theunmanifest couch, fondling the cat and ordering pizza via an app. Everythingabout our experience of life suggests it is to be interpreted in a narrative fashionand the most widespread narrative found on earth is that of Joseph Campbell’s"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"Hero’s Journey.People seeking the ‘meaning’ of life are perhaps heading in the wrongdirection or, put another way, circling around and around in their kitchen.Humans do not appear to be seeking meaning so much as experience.Experience of the other, experience of the new, experience of the numinous. Itcertainly feels, in the experience of experience, that there is a resonant effectfrom one’s physical life out into the entire cosmos.Wizards, then, should have significant lives. If this does not interest you,then I suggest you find yourself a cheaper hobby, such as collecting the art ofDamien Hirst or heroin addiction.The Art of War for WizardsArguments against the need for adventurism in magic are as shallow as theyare moronic, and I have heard them all: That it is somehow neo-colonialist –asif white Europeans are the only ones to go adventuring. Such an attitude denies95% of the earth’s population their humanity. Or that it is genderist –as ifAboriginal women never fished, hunted or quested. Adventure does not requiremachismo, only courage, and the most courageous people I have ever methave all been women. Most laughable of all is that it is classist because it costsmoney. However pleasant the experience may be, business class flights toseven-star resorts on the Arabian Gulf are not adventures (unless your flight ishijacked). Indeed, the whole point of the adventure –reflected in the story ofthe Major Arcana of the Tarot- is that one proceeds out into the world withnothing and returns as the universe entire.Any outlays associated with adventuring should not be seen as costs but asinvestments.

The CEOs with the most global experience tend to be the mostwell-paid. We live in a time of chaos –I have written an entire book, The ChaosProtocols, about how to proceed through such times- and chaos is the great,fecund mangrove swamp of opportunity.When seeing costs as ‘investments’, this is not for a second to suggest thatadventuring is exclusively or even primarily economically motivated.

Given the appropriatebackground context and experience, this is indeed the case. For those of us inthe western traditions, you are best served by gaining some theatricalexposure, even something as simple as being an amateur stage hand or hosting‘reading aloud’ evenings in your house will suffice. This is to be combined withan understanding of the shared history of theatre and Classical philosophy.They emerge from the same impulse and are attempts to answer the same,eternally-unanswerable question.Stepping backwards in time from the Classical Age, we see the vastmajority of Near-Eastern myths, but especially the Akkadian ones, werewritten in the bare-bones style of stageplays or performative texts. The storiesfrom Babylon lack the descriptive imagery and sheer delight in vocabularythat one finds in Homer. Embellishments and flourishes were breathed into thetexts by their narrators and singers, in real time, in the act of storytelling.

Magic happens in the performance of it, not in its silent contemplation.Anyone else who misspent their largely-sexless adolescence playing roleplaying games would be aware that games nights are often accompanied bypeculiar states of consciousness and even the odd poltergeist effect.We may presume that role playing games and theatre and the singing ofGilgamesh are themselves distant echoes of supremely ancient forms of whattwentieth century scholars called Sympathetic Magic; the shamanic mimicryof prey animals on the Steppes or the donning of masks that resembled facesglimpsed at the edges of the campfire light. I rather suspect that the first evermagical ritual performed on this planet was a matching of the human formwith some observed natural phenomena, perhaps a swaying in time with thewind through the branches of the trees or the movement of a hand followingthe flight of a bird.Physical ritual is magic’s primal form and it is designed to resonate with orecho something in the wider universe. (Think back to the previous chapter andhow the Hero’s Journey can be viewed as a long-term ritual.)Understood in this way, ritual’s resonant properties offer undeniablysuperior methods of achieving psychological health when compared to muchof what is for sale via the allopathic medical industry. One of the mostremarkable books I have read in years is Alejandro Jodorowsky’s Manual ofPsychomagic. The legendary filmmaker devised hundreds of small ritualperformances –psychoanalysis in action- for achieving emotional resolution.My personal favourite is his psychomagical cure for homesickness: get arelative in your homeland to send you ten pounds of earth, which is placed inan open container. Each day, the operant sits with his/her feet in the ‘earthfootbath’ for half an hour while watching television or reading. When theoperant is next in his/her homeland, he/she should also plant a tree.Any magician reading Jodorowsky’s recommendation cannot fail to beimpressed.

The changes in opinion werelargely determined by the church’s prevailing attitude to sorcery at the time.Thus, Renaissance magician, Marsilio Ficino, managed to avoid ending up on apyre by opting for a ‘natural magic’ that relied on the unseen energies inherentin Creation rather than trafficking with demons and faeries.With the slightly-improved insight that has come from a century ofpsychical research, phenomenology and UFO experiences, we arrive at thepremise that there is probably quite a bit to this whole ‘spirit thing’. Thesefindings provide us with a cleaner definition of what specifically magical ritual(are there any other kinds?) might be about. Christopher Knowles says thatmagic is all about “getting their attention”. A spirit model –and attracting theattention of the spirits- empowers us to re-enchant the world. We can also castour eyes back to the past and spy ‘getting their attention’ in the ritual behaviourof our ancestors. Consider what is conjured in the mind’s eye when readingsome excerpts from The Third Hymn to Inanna: The Holy One:The people of Sumer parade before you.They play the sweet ala drums before you.The people of Sumer parade before you.I say “Hail!” to Inanna, Great Lady of Heaven!They beat the holy drums and timpani before you....The people compete with jump ropes and coloured cords.The people of Sumer parade before you....The ascending kugarra priests raise their swords before you.The priest, who covers his sword with blood, sprinkles blood,"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"He sprinkles blood over the throne of the court chamber.The tigi-drum, the sem-drum and the ala-tambourine resound!In the heavens, the Holy One appears alone.My Lady looks in sweet wonder from heaven.She looks in sweet wonder on all the lands,And on the people of Sumer as numerous as sheep.When you realise the hymn is but a piece of a wider ritual celebration and that,if the hypothesis holds, there is ‘something’ on the other end of the line, it is hardto escape the conclusion these Sumerians probably got the attention of that‘something’. While the economics of large-scale civic festivals honouring theplanet Venus are currently unfeasible down on a personal level, the past offersus both aspiration and inspiration for deepening our own ritual activity andpresumably assisting our attention attraction efforts.Large civic attempts to attract attention have informed imperialarchitecture for centuries. London is one of the world’s great pageant cities andas you move about its heart, you are struck on multiple levels by the deliberateuse of space, buildings, parks, Egyptian obelisks, statues of long-dead monarchsand sightlines down processional routes all designed to reinforce the ‘spell’ ofroyal power.

This is doubly-disappointing because it not only means one ismore likely to fall victim to the ‘spell’, it also means the magician is leavingsome very useful tech on the table.The same can be said of magicians’ surprising disinterest in the odd ritualbehaviour of organisations such as NASA. If ritual is ‘getting their attention’then drenching rockets in Egyptian symbolism and firing them at the planetsand moons of traditional astrology is a ritual. Why do you suppose there are somany odd consciousness effects in astronauts and strange things sometimesspied from livestreamed cameras attached to the international space station?Such disinterest on the part of so-called magicians may well be professionaljealousy.

Almost no other creature does it and those that doare alarmingly intelligent -approaching humans in their use of language andsymbolic thinking- such as the corvid, octopus or elephant.Sacrifice is fascinating because it is a topological rearrangement of theuniverse, either in its material form –burnt offerings, ritual murder, etc- or inits temporal form –fasting, sexual abstinence, etc. Rearranging the topology ofthe universe is almost by definition a godlike power given that that is probablyhow the whole enchilada was created in the first place. To echo or mimic thatis certainly a very good way of getting attention.Synchromysticism as KabbalahHow does the Technical Hermetica ‘work’? How did Ficino’s system ofplanetary ritual magic ‘work’?"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"Simply put, both work because some things are associated with other things.Symbols recur, patterns repeat, sounds heard on a radio associate with similaroutcomes in your life. An Animist universe speaks a language of symbol andsynchronicity. To you, to itself, to the birds.This awareness underpins systems of magical correspondence the worldover –such as practical Kabbalah or Technical Hermetica. They are all parsedthrough their own worldviews –most of them too textually based for my ownliking- and focusing on one or using one to ‘explain’ another is to throw awaythe candy bar and eat the wrapper.These systems are indications that the universe speaks in a symboliclanguage –which is why ritual works in the first place- but they do not constitutethe entirety of the language. They are at best small phrasebooks picked up at anairport on your way to Babel. Certainly use them but use them in a widersynchromystic context: they provide interpretations, translations, of thelanguage of the universe.Leaning into the universeThe Rune Soup definition of magical ritual is that it is a non-specific probabilityenhancer. You can perform them as needed, of course, but -once yourdivinations and regular enchantments are up and firing- you can also discernwhen resonant ritual times are coming back around again and lean into them.These repeated times of ‘resonant opportunity’ may or may not be related toastrology but they certainly appear to ‘work’ in the same way.A personal example may be illustrative. From the late summer of 2015, Ibegan to discern a string of curious personal ‘replays’ that matched the sametime in 2013... a half-year that resulted in the culmination of an unsatisfyingcareer phase as well as a dramatic rise in wealth and opportunity. So I spentthose autumn and winter months deliberately replaying some of the high pointsof the same period in 2013: we went to the same market towns in Wiltshire, weate at the same restaurants, I even re-read some of the books I was reading andre-watched some of the television programmes I was watching in 2013.

What Crowley failed to mention is that afteryears of regular magical work, it seems likely that he could ‘sense’ his ownfuture state of having money and performed the actions required to ‘bring thatstate down to earth’/resonate with it.Without this learned ability, most people who try the ‘oysters andchampagne’ approach just end up a little bit drunker and a little bit poorer.

There areseveral ways this probably ‘works’ and I expect one or more is in play witheach successful act of clairvoyance.1. Your present self makes contact with a future self that is inpossession of the information such as the physical description of theman you are going to marry or the streetscape outside your futureworkplace.2.

As the saying goes,nothing lasts but nothing is lost.Remote Viewing: The Chaos Magic WayThis is really a two-player game but I have yielded some interesting one-player results by purchasing some old postcards from the Notting Hill marketsand having someone else slip them into some numbered envelopes. (Thenumbers are for recording purposes.) You could also get a friend to print offtwenty random pictures from a Google image search.General best practice suggests you should be sober, alert, well and evenempty-stomached to yield the most accurate viewings. I time these for themorning after a fast day, which also means I have not consumed alcohol forover twenty-four hours -something I assume is a factor. Dr Russell Targ,founder of the Stargate Program, also suggests the session should occur in adimly lit room. In London everything is dimly lit, so I can’t vouch for whetherthis helps or not.Step 1DECIDE ON THE TARGET. If you are working with someone else this shouldbe one of a variety of oddly-shaped, multi-textured objects. Examples includeplastic crocodile toys, hockey pucks, clay bricks, and so on.

Also the reader sketches her impressions of what she sees. Always startwith what is surprising or odd about the object, focusing entirely on the senses.If, at any stage, the reader receives a clear impression of what the object‘is’, such as a riverine landscape or a toaster, she writes that object on the righthand side of the page and ‘dumps’ it from her mind. It is extremely likely theseimpressions are what Ingo Swann called the ‘analytic overlay’. The humanmind, like nature, appears to abhor a vacuum and leaps to fill in the dots: Around object is... a ball! Except when it isn’t.Step 3TAKE A BREAK FOR A FEW MINUTES. Make tea or just sit and breathe fora while. Then return your awareness to the paper and see if any additionalimpressions come to you. Particularly see if new impressions of earlierobservations come to mind: it’s cold... and it’s also shiny. Or green. Orwhatever.Dr Targ observes that, in order to be right, you also have to be willing to bewrong. Do not overthink the process and remember that the best remoteviewers (that we know of) on earth reached a level of accuracy between 50%and 75%. Wrong comes with the territory. It’s not an exam.Step 4IF THERE IS room on the same sheet, summarise your impressions beginningwith the ones you feel the strongest about, in descending order of confidence.Otherwise use a second sheet of paper."},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"Then make a call about what the object or target is. You can either say “it’sa toy crocodile or dinosaur”, or “it’s a small, plastic object. Probably a toy. It’sgreen and spiky.”At this point, if you are working with a partner, he or she will then show youthe object and talk you through the parts you got correct. I guarantee you willfind things on the object that you wanted to describe but didn’t. Hence the needfor practice.Now, do it over and over. And over.Divination for Fun and ProfitPerhaps the most famous remote viewing experiment -even making the frontpage of the Wall Street Journal- was when Russell Targ’s team called the week-end for the silver futures market nine times in a row, making $120,000 in 1982money. Each week, assistants selected objects that they would hand to theremote viewers at the end of the week, depending on whether silver was:Up a little.Up a lot.Down a little.Down a lot.Trades were made accordingly and after the Friday bell, the correspondingobject –a bottle of champagne, some old pancakes- were handed to the viewer.(Targ cautions they were unsuccessful the next year when they repeated thetrial.)There is a way to replicate this experiment using only a practitioner and anassistant. Select a market that is volatile and select an outcome that is binary.For example, the USD Index, and whether it is up or down.1. Get two envelopes that say ‘up’ and ‘down’.2. Have an assistant randomly select images/postcards and place onein each envelope in such a way that he/she does not see the images.3. The viewer does a reading as described above.4.

I’ve already contributed to moving thispractice forward as a hugely effective form of practical enchantment so I amgoing to avoid it here. Every band gets tired of playing their old stuff.

Swidden farming is an unpredictablepractice. An area of land that may seem suitable can be disastrous if there istoo much or too little rain, or if the river is too low. Any number of factors in ahugely complex ecosystem can determine whether the Kantu eat or not. Thusany kind of systemic procedure for selecting agricultural sites will fail in fairlyshort order. Yet the Kantu do not starve.Anthropologists presumed that the presence of these bird species conveyedsomething ecological about the quality of the soil in the typically poor-qualityland of the Kantu. It turns out this is not the case at all, and it is precisely therandom appearance of the birds that prevents any kind of systematic methodfrom developing, thus ensuring site diversification. It is this diversification –thischaos- that gives the Kantu crops an over-the-odds chance of survival for thatseason. (The keen-eyed Animist would –and should- point out that even if thebirds aren’t saying something ecological, they are obviously saying somethingelse.)The lesson of the Kantu is one of harnessing probability. Of leaning intochaos, of pouring fuel onto burning chaos. The birds are an excellent metaphorfor the physical components of practical magic: they are observably uselessyet, used correctly, they work. They facilitate a dialogue between the Kantuand a location’s probabilistic conditions that give the Kantu people an edge.It is just so with practical enchantment. Universal prescriptions do not helpyou to drive to your own probabilistic conditions.

Revisiting that least popular of practices -prayer- is auseful counterbalance.Prayer has a lot of good data behind it these days. From the intentionalityexperiments of William Tiller to Elizabeth Targ’s research that patients who areprayed for recover faster than those who aren’t -even if the recipient isunaware he or she is being prayed for. Analysis of these data suggest prayercomes with its own best practices:1. Group prayer works better than individual prayer, particularly ifsimultaneous praying is involved. Note, it appears more importantfor prayer to coincide in time rather than space. It is presumablybetter to have people praying for the same goal in the samelocation, but there is little observable impact on outcomes whendistance is involved as long as simultaneity is observed.2. Pray for a being rather than to a being. Examples include usingphrasing such as “may your temples and holy places be restored,may the offering pyres burn high once again, may your name beon the lips and hearts of every seeker in the West.” Then slip yourown request in somewhere at the end. You would have to bepossessed of a fairly rudimentary understanding of Divinity tosuppose that this sort of flattery somehow ‘tricks’ a god. Rather it islikely that praying for something brings you further into alignmentwith its grace. As C.S. Lewis observed, ‘prayer doesn’t change God.Prayer changes you.’3.

If you wantan apron or a badge, do not join an occult group but think about joining asociety that has some actual clout, like Skull and Bones. Even the Rotariansqualify for discounts at some chain restaurants.Dr Stephen Skinner observes two main reasons initiation is problematic inthe West. Firstly, the line was broken so any initiation is -by definition- areconstitution and hence cannot really deliver on its promises. Secondly,western ‘initiations’ are formed in a Masonic mode and are thus human-centric.This is in contrast to the Chinese traditions he compares them to that considerthe aspirant to be initiated when he/she can successfully summon and bind theassigned class of spirits. It is only after that does the applicant move onto thenext class of spirits. This not only seems to be a much more effective system,it is one we can reverse-engineer into the individual western magician’s life by,you know, doing magic.What do you suppose happened to mankind’s first ever shaman?

Something broke and let magic andtechnology in. ‘True’ initiation is a play-out of that reality and the subsequentpractice of magic is proof that it stuck. In The Sacred and the Profane, Eliadewrites:[The initiated human] further believes that life has a sacred originand that human existence realizes all its potentialities in proportionas it is religious – that is, participates in reality. The gods createdman and the world, the culture heroes completed Creation, and thehistory of all these divine and semi-divine works is preserved in themyths. By reactualizing sacred history, by imitating the divinebehavior, man puts and keeps himself close to the gods – that is, inthe real and significant.You will discern my profound ambivalence to the concept of ‘proper’ initiationby revisiting the chapter on ritual. If you start down this path, one way oranother you will ‘get their attention’ and the myth cycle will play out in yourlife anyway. Jung recognised the same thing when talking about how theunacknowledged or ignored aspects of the unconscious will come to dominateyour life if you do not face them. Eliade saw the same thing when he observedthat modern culture continues to play out the initiatory shape, albeit in adeclined form:Very often the “struggle for life,” the “ordeals” and “difficulties”that stand in the way of a vocation or a career, in some sortreiterate the ordeals of initiation; it is after the “blows” that aredealt to him, the moral and even physical “suffering” and“torture” he undergoes, that a young man “proves” himself, knowshis possibilities, grows conscious of his powers, and finally"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"becomes himself, spiritually adult and creative (the spirituality is,of course, what is understood as such in the modern world.)Initiation will always find the seeker -she who has recognised that there is acrack in the world and decides to see if it is indeed how the light gets in.

One day thundersaid “what sort of creature is man, that he can turn over in hissleep? I have to get up to turn over.” Elephant responded “Itoo have to stand up if I want to turn over in my sleep.”Note: It is interesting that what causes alarm for elephant and thunder is sleepproficiency, dream proficiency... proficiency over the imaginal. Man has aseparate inner world to the natural kingdom.Thunder declares that it fears man and escapes to the heavens.Elephant mocks thunder for this, saying that man is only asmall thing, so he shall stay behind. “But he is bad,” thundersays. “He can turn over in his sleep.”Man is pleased that thunder has left, because he was afraid ofthunder. He then goes to the jungle, fashions a bow and arrowand dips the arrow in poison. Man shoots elephant, who criesout in pain and raises his trunk to the heavens, calling on hisfriend, thunder, to save him. Thunder refuses. “I shall not takeyou, for you mocked me when I said that man was bad andyou said he was small.”Elephant died and man became great in all the lands of the earth."},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"This story is emblematic of the Fall/violation-of-taboo/beginning-of-magicmotif that not only underpins the Creation stories of this planet, but one that isritually played out in initiation, typically ending in a restoration of the world,such as we find in the Hermetica. (It also has some personally pleasing ancientalien motifs.) We find the same thing in the story of Simon Magus who is -almost criminally- our most-ignored magical ancestor. In his apocryphaldebate with the apostle Peter, Simon argues that the God of the Law isimperfect and -by definition- could not be the supreme god. A tenth centurySyrian bishop puts some words in Simon’s mouth:“God willed that Adam should not eat of the tree; but he did eat; he,therefore, did not remain as God willed him to remain: it results,therefore, that the maker of Adam is impotent.[..]For what reason on earth did God curse the serpent? For if hecursed him as the one who caused the harm, why did he notrestrain him from doing so, that is, from seducing Adam? But if hecursed him as one who had brought some advantage, in that he wasthe cause of Adam’s eating of the good tree, it needs must followthat he was distinctly unrighteous and envious...”This was the logic Simon marshalled to defend his use of magic and traffickingwith angels against the buzzkill apostle. Here again, magic enters the worldthrough a crack, a taboo, a Fall. From a psychoanalytic perspective, the firsttime a child gets away with lying to a parent, he or she learns that they have aseparate worldview –a separate inner reality- to the parent or parents. The liedemonstrates the separateness of self. It is that very separateness ofworldviews that underpins origin stories. In Eden, everything is naked -not justthe humans- but after violating the taboo Eve now knows it. In the Nandi tale,thunder knows that man has a separate worldview and becomes fearful.Initiation then, is a form of ritual as described in a preceding chapter as aresonance with or re-enactment of this moment of Creation.Orders, viewed over a long enough timeline, are really just a pre-internet"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"way of delivering magical tech. ‘Magic’ -whatever that is- will find you.

I am passionate about history and so the act of lining up myown practical enchantment within an observable historical current may ‘getme deeper in the zone’, so to speak. It is worth pointing out that I think thisexplanation is highly unlikely, at least as a singular explanation anyway.Finally, a grimoire-based approach is a perfect match forphenomenological analysis. We may even call modern grimoire magic‘performative phenomenology’. Contained within the family trees of thevarious spirit lists are age-old recordings of Magonian encounters -from localmonsters to foreign storm gods to the decans found painted on the inside ofMiddle Kingdom Egyptian coffins.

Very little can be achieved without their –I don’t want to saysupport- but at least their tacit acquiescence. Of course, some place spirits aremore amenable with offering support. London will rarely help you but cancertainly become interested in you. That can have its own uses. Regardingofferings, London likes Bordeaux.

It can becombined with the circle and spirit conjuration in this chapter. For those with anunhealthy risk appetite, it can be used sans circle, merely teamed with aninvocation to St Cyprian. Finally, some combination of the two can be used withthe Elestial shewstone method listed below.Prayer of St CyprianSt Cyprian of Antioch is the undisputed patron saint of the grimoire tradition. Inhis apocryphal fourth century Confession, he lives the quintessential pan-Mediterranean wizard’s life before converting to Christianity. Born in Antioch towealthy parents, he is initiated into Mystery traditions there, he then becomes acitizen of Athens and then journeys to Egypt to join the Memphite priesthoodbefore returning to his native lands. All along the way he picks up andembodies the polyglot influences that informed the Theurgy and practicalmagic of the time.This is before he even begins his very Game of Thrones afterlife,journeying to the cold of Northern Europe and appearing in grimoires there,and heading west onto the Iberian peninsula and -by that route- out across the"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"Atlantic where he looms large in various New World magical system.Saint Cyprian is the magical saint you are looking for.

Something about the defixio feels as ifit is the bizarro-world sigil, the solve for when you have malefic requirementsand do not want to store them into your own head. Also like sigils, much is to begained by exploring and experimenting with this form, assuming you havesufficient enemies to do so. (As with prayer, defixiones can be used to set yourwill against the enemies of the whole world. So you should be more than finefor targets, unfortunately.)The classic defixio is a letter to the dead and/or the gods of the underworld,scratched into thin pieces of lead, then rolled up and spiked with a nail beforebeing thrown into an open tomb or a well. Hundreds of variations on this themehave been found across the Roman Empire. Many of them would look entirelyfamiliar to today’s rootworkers in both function and phrasing. Names ofenemies have been crossed out seven times, personal effects have beenincluded, bargains made and so on. One defixio found on the Appian Wayheading into Rome has alternating lines written upside down, a style I haveadopted for my own defixiones. In the more than seven centuries thatdefixiones were used, thriving local industries built up around them so that theilliterate could pay to have one inscribed against his or her enemies by aspecialist craftsman. Think of it like a pan-dimensional Imperial telegramservice.Today we no longer have an abundance of scrap lead lying about uponwhich to carve our defixiones. The metal appears to have been used mostly forconvenience rather than for any ‘magical’ association. Indeed, the death/leadassociation could have a lot to do with the substance’s use in these veryenchantments, rather than the other way around. (That and the fact that leadpipes go underground.) So I mostly just use the same card stock that I keeparound for sigil shoaling, though I have retained the use of nails as these are stilleasy to come by.What follows is my Confounding Defixio. Rarely do I find myself in thesituation of actually wanting someone dead or –mercifully- needing someoneto be so. More commonly -particularly in business- you want someone who iscausing or risks causing reputational damage thwarted or confounded.Essentially you want a target’s plans or machinations to crumble or unwind as"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"fast as possible. This goal combined with the underworld components of adefixio mean that your cosmic pen pal can be none other than Nebiros.Nebiros or Naberius is a grimoire spirit whose name likely derives from aconflation of Anubis and Cerberus. Naberius appears in the form of a three-headed dog –providing the Cerberus connection- or in the form of a crow,which suggests speech or speaking to the dead. More than that, though:Naberius can either restore lost dignities or procure the loss of dignities -aperfect match for either restorative or destructive reputational magic.If you have developed a working relationship with Hermanubis asdescribed in The Chaos Protocols then call him into the ritual space in whichyou will construct your defixio. They are –in many ways- mutations of thesame form. (Or rather, there are some deep structural overlaps you willeventually encounter.) Otherwise St Cyprian and a conjuration similar to thatdescribed above will be more than sufficient.WRITE the following on black card or scratch it onto a thin sheet of lead if yousomehow have such a thing, you weirdo:Naberius, I invoke you by the gods in Hades, OUCHITOU, andby the dispenser of tombs.Bind every limb and sinew of [name]. Bind both [name] and all[his/her] actions. Confound all [name]’s plans.I register [name] in the books of the underworld for failure inword and deed.

When it comes todepositing your defixio in a graveyard, ensure you have permission and aworking relationship with the graveyard spirits, lest you risk some pretty intenseblowback. I have dropped defixiones off the Hammersmith bridge into theThames in west London but only after building up that relationship. It seems toplease the Thames, as a former Roman port town, to participate in these ritualsagain. (Regular readers may have noticed I have a fascination with riverspirits, particularly those that create cities along their banks.)Obviously this form lends itself to near infinite variations of text, spirit,construction and disposal. Learn by doing.Love and Sex ‘Spells’Improvements in psychology as well as ongoing sexual emancipation havemade this category far more redundant than most people realise. There are nolove spells in the Greek Magical Papyri. As Dr Stephen Skinner observes, thissuggests very strongly that their original authors were moonlighting priestsfrom Egyptian temples. Love spells do then proliferate in European folk magicwhere the life outcomes of women were far more tied to securing and keepinga decent marriage than it is today. They are evidence of oppressive culturalmilieus that –whilst there is obviously much further to go in securing trueequality- resemble today’s dating landscape less and less.I actually swore off love ‘spells’ almost twenty years ago. It seems thateither they are successful and become unmitigated disasters in the lives of theenchanter and enchanted or they are unsuccessful and further enable creepystalker behaviour -behaviour which is used by the perpetrator as an excuse toavoid much-needed emotional or psychological development. Love -being"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"miraculous- is better suited to prayer than enchantment.As for sex enchantments, my go-to in much wilder, much younger dayswas to sigilise for increased encounter rates and dedicate a night out on the pullto Dionysus: pouring the first drink of the evening on the naked ground to him,then offering the opportunity to skinride during the drugs, dancing and(hopefully) inevitable sex that was to follow. This falls under the ‘getting theirattention’ rules of divine contact. I am unsure how interested Dionysus (orwhomever) would be in skinriding while you sit on your couch, swiping left orright on your phone. Sometimes the old ways are better.An Elestial ShewstoneMy mother the psychonaut now has so many crystals she is probably tippingthe east coast of Australia slowly into the sea. For a while, she was in the habitof spontaneously sending large specimens from her travels to London until itbecame apparent that the excess weight fees applied by the Royal Mail riskedbankrupting me.After one such painful trip to my post office to pick up a very heavypackage and pay the inexplicably high duty, I became the begrudging owner ofa very large piece of Elestial quartz she had acquired in Peru. As I grumpilylifted it out of its packaging on the street in front of the post office, my left handpicked it up and suddenly my mind’s eye could see over an intricate MC-Escher-style city of what looked like crocodile people, dressed as if the ancientMaya were cast in the movie Tron. (Mother is a skilled collector.) And that’show I got my shewstone.Unfashionable though they are among magic’s cool kids, there is much torecommend crystals. That said, I find most crystal ‘correspondences’ to bebeyond absurd.

And so we have the Tritopatores, a form that allows for theincorporation of all those forgotten gods and allies into your contemporarypractice.The Tritopatores are the unremembered ancestral gods of all mankind.They are the gods, heroes and ancestors whose names we no longer speak.Orpheus describes them as ‘gatekeepers of the wind’ in his Physika, ‘wind’, ‘air’and ‘spirit’ being etymologically related.

By the Babylonian era, many of"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"the enchantments in old Sumerian had long been divorced from their originalcontext. However, in his The Ark Before Noah, Dr Finkel suggest he has foundan origin for this particular enchantment. Around 2,000 BC the Sumerians wereimporting fierce mastiff dogs from Elam and zi-im-zi-la-ah appears to be thename for an Elamite dog warden. He suggests this is an incorrect borrowing ofan administrative text into much later magic at a time when the earlier writingwas difficult to understand. Possibly. But given the long attestation of dogs asguardians of the spirit world I would say it is more likely the terminology isdeliberate. Thus this spell wrangles and commands unruly spirits out of a placein the same way a dog warden would wrangle and command what must haveappeared to be terrifying demons to Sumerian eyes -these foreign mastiffs.And so we come back to dogs, spirits and cynocephali once more.I can attest to this charm’s efficacy for minor spirit removals, particularlyif you are caught out without your toys. If you are not, then it works evenbetter when combined with a spirit rattle.The Exorcism of St CyprianThe following is the work of St Cyprian as exorcist and banisher of demons.This is particularly useful in clearing recalcitrant infestations of physical space.It is modified from an exorcism of a person as described in José Leitão’sessential The Book of St Cyprian: The Sorcerer’s Treasure.

The Sibyls are back.After almost five centuries, the Council of Trent banned the Song of theSibyl from being performed at Christmas Mass in the 1500s, though it wasimmediately restored by churches in Catalonia and Majorca. Perhaps the"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"councillors realised that having a superstar pagan prophetess and goddess beingled up to the altar to then turn around and sing the End of the World to thecongregation was no longer a good match for Christian Europe? For that is whatthe Sibyls are -superstar prophetesses and goddesses. Contemporaryoccultism’s ignorance of them borders on criminal.The etymology of the word, ‘sibyl’ was unknown even in Classical times.Julius Caesar’s chief librarian, Marcus Terentius Varro hazarded a guess that itcame from a long-forgotten dialect of Aeolian once spoken in Asia Minor. Afew centuries later Pausanias was adamant the word was North African. Theoffice of the Sibyl was too old even then to be certain. The Sibyls were just...there.Similarly, no consensus appears on the number of Sibyls and whether or notthe term referred to an ‘office’ such as their far more acceptable cousins, theOracles. We may assume many women ‘gifted’ with prophetic powers whofell outside the state approval that accompanied Oracles were called Sibyl.Plutarch writes[T]he sibyl with raving mouth, according to Heraclitus, uttersthings mirthless and unadorned and unperfumed, and her voicecarries through a thousand years because of the god who speaksthrough her.This is divination done rough –the unlicensed dentists of the Classical World’sprophecy industry. The most famous of the Sibyls is the Sibyl of Cumae, whoprophesied from a cave you can still visit northwest of modern day Naples. Itwas to her that Aeneas went, believing only she had the power to correctlyprophesy the outcome of the Trojan War.My favourite legend of the Cumaean Sibyl is her presenting the nineSibylline Books of Prophecy to Tarquinius Superbus, who balked at their price.She burned three of the nine books in front of him and kept the price the same.Still the king said no. The Sibyl burned the next three books and kept the price"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"the same. Tarquinius bought them. (That is how you negotiate.) He was the lastof the seven kings of Rome. Probably should have bought the whole set.It was the Sibyls’ association with the prophetic good stuff that got themcaught up in Christian Apologetics as the early church philosophers attemptedto demonstrate the legitimacy of Christ by recourse to Classical pagan sourcesand prophecies. Lactantius, in The Divine Institutes, even throws in HermesTrismegistus for extra effect: “But that there is a Son of the Most High God,who is possessed of the greatest power, is shown not only by the unanimousutterances of the prophets, but also by the declaration of Trismegistus and thepredictions of the Sibyls.” This is how the Sibyl ended up getting her invite toChristmas Mass in Majorca. Constantine even quoted a purported Sibyllineprophecy that spelled out the name of Jesus at the First Council of Nicaea.Through the Middle Ages and into the Renaissance, various Sibyllineprophetic books and depictions appeared across Europe, most notably theSibylline Oracles. It is here that the Sibyls become useful to the practicingmagician once more through their amalgamation with each other andsubsequent coronation in Faery.For my money, Camille Paglia’s analysis of Spenser’s The Faerie Queenein her Sexual Personae remains definitive:So the liberated woman is the symbol of the English Renaissance,as the beautiful boy is the symbol of the Italian. In The FaerieQueene we see her in free movement. I speak, of course, ofartistic projection and not of the life of real British women. But artis what transcends and what survives. Of all truths, it is the finest.[..]The Faerie Queene is the most extended and extensive meditationon sex in the history of poetry.[..] Spenser agrees with classical andChristian philosophers on the primacy of reason over animalappetite. He looks forward to the Romantic poets, however, in the"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"way that he shows the sex impulse as innately daemonic andbarbaric, breeding witches and sorcerers of evil allure.[..]Christianity, far from putting out the pagan eye, merely expandedits power. Christianity’s vast tracts of the forbidden are virginterritory for the pagan eye to penetrate and defile. The FaerieQueene is a massively original analysis of these tensions inwestern culture.Elizabeth I looms large in the English imagination at this point. And it is worthobserving that The Faerie Queene emerges in the same reign as John Dee’sexploration of the angelic realms and is thus more or less concurrent with thecelebrated Daughter of Fortitude revelation. Both Dee and Spenser peer out ona vast imaginal empire and even contribute to its materialisation in the form ofthe nascent British Empire. At the centre of this imaginal empire they both seea magical queen emerging, dripping with martial and sexual potency.One last contemporaneous writer needs to be thrown into the mix. ReginaldScot and his Discoverie of Witchcraft, which includes a very detailedconjuration of a Sibyl as Faery Queen, modified below. Clearly something wasgoing on in the non-physical at the time and it is no small thanks to whateverthat was that we, a mere five centuries later, were all blessed with J.R.RTolkien’s own discovery of ‘Faery’ and the subsequent delivery of the mostastounding ‘fictional’ landscape ever encountered.The Sibyl likely blended with the Queen of Faery in witchcraft and ritualmagic because she possessed ecclesiastical legitimacy -albeit an uneasy one.She is a thing the church says exists that also is not a demon or an angel -justlike faeries (most of the time). This hybridisation brings into alignment theSibyl’s sovereignty over the far reaches of Magonia with her ancestry in theterrifying utterances of chthonic prophecy in deepest antiquity.And so we come to the final enchantment of the book and the reason forperforming it. The benediction of the Sibyls: the sound of their voice heralds"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"the re-enchantment of the world and the restoration of the western imagination.In its performance -if she is pleased- lies your own lifetime pass into her realmof Faery, an inexhaustible spring of creative fecundity and inspiration. Eachperformance of the benediction brings the re-enchantment of our world onestep closer.Step 1SCOT WRITES that the magician should ‘go to a place fast by’, in ‘a fairparlour or chamber’. This ritual is not to be done at home, likely because itrequires the assistance of a recently dead criminal who is to ‘fetch’ the FairySibylia for the magician.A modern modification of this would be to impose on St Cyprian in his roleas Bishop of the Graveyard to bring in the Sibyl for you. That is what I did, butI also did not perform this rite in my house. We rented a ‘fair parlour’ in theNew Forest -which seemed appropriate- and I found a clearing nearby to theInn. Interestingly, the ritual also calls for a hazel wand, which I did not possessfor the trip but found one for sale the afternoon of the rite in Sibyl (!)

It is far more effective to assert sovereignty over your ownritual year that rely on a British agrarian one wholly invented by a couple ofEdwardian nudists.Two simple facts. Firstly, we have not been farming for all that long in thegrand scheme of the human journey. Secondly, farmers do not need a priest totell them when to plant or when to harvest. This is immediately apparent tothem via the local climatic conditions which can often vary by up to a month inany given year as the regularity of our little planet’s trips around the sun aremitigated by other cyclical effects such as Ice Ages, El Niños, cosmic rays,volcanic eruptions, forest fires or local pest infestations.The calendarisation of storytelling and cultural activities long predatessettled agriculture. For the Boorong People of Australia, when the giant fishconstellation set with the sun it was time to begin the trip north to the Mille Riverwhere their cousins dwelled, for feasting and ritual. Stories lend themselves tocyclical ritualisation, which are then associated with agriculture or hunting andgathering. One is seen as a reflection of the other, and interrelated in aprofound way –such as the rising of Sirius and the flooding of the Nile in"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"Dynastic Egypt. These phenomena co-relate to rather than predict theirpartner. Indeed, it is probably profoundly important on a metaphysical leveljust why it is that the cosmos appears to shape itself after a story.Putting the Magic Back in AstrologyWhatever is going on here, the universe does appear to have waveformrhythms, which is to say, cycles. This reality underpins ritual calendars theworld over and –occasionally- thinkers, artists and philosophers try to describeit more accurately. Poet and Golden Dawn magician, William Butler Yeats, didwith his concept of gyres. Terence McKenna did with his concept ofTimewave Zero, Martin Armstrong was illegally held without charge for yearsfor refusing to divulge the details of his Pi-based Economic Confidence Model.(Goldman Sachs and the CIA both wanting to get their claws on a model shouldbe enough to pique the interest of any chaos magician looking for anadvantage.)Being a subset of the universe, human culture and behaviour expresseswaveform rhythms. As Brutus says in Julius Caesar:There is a tide in the affairs of men.Which, taken at the flood, leads on to fortune;Omitted, all the voyage of their lifeIs bound in shallows and in miseries.(Act 4. Scene iii.)Magicians seem less inclined to take Brutus’s tide when it is running, insteadpreferring the far more modern (seventeenth century) approach of clumsy,ham-fisted force of casually picking a planet from a grimoiric look-up tableand bashing away."},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"Astrology is elegance... a descriptor rarely associated with occultists. Ifyou read through the dizzying number of proscriptions in a text such as thePicatrix what emerges is an almost-Eastern sense of ‘right action, right time’.The planets are not IBM Help Desk. In fact, they are probably described asphysical representations of the cosmos’s control system in more texts than theydescribed as helpful or benign.But patience and subtlety of action tend to invalidate the western magician’sbelief in his or her (usually his) omnipotence and importance to the universe.Do not make that mistake. Either become a world expert in astrological magicand build your entire system around it or take the ‘ten thousand foot view’ andget the lay of the land each year from a competent astrologer and adjust yourplans accordingly. The middle ground is worse than useless. It is easier to starta fire in a drought than it is during a flood. Know which is which.Enchantments and TimingStaying momentarily with astrology, it is interesting to consider the possibilitythat it may have nothing at all to do with the planets. It was the explanatorymodel that the neighbouring bodies in our solar system exert some kind offorce or rays on earthlife that led to the initial rejection of astrology in theearly days of chaos magic. But just as magic itself may be a culture-specificway of modelling and using mankind’s naturally occurring psi capacities,astrology may well be a culture-specific way of modelling thewaveform/cyclical nature of reality that we observe right down to thesubatomic level. If you have read Star.Ships: A Prehistory of the Spirits you willknow that organising cultural life around the position and reappearance of thestars is an exceedingly long-lived idea... long enough for it to have developedinto a workable system thanks to tens of millennia of trial and error. How itworks is very much another matter.There is an element of Pascal’s Wager to all of this that makes ritual timingworthy of consideration for even the most dyed-in-the-wool Chaote. One ofthe grandfathers of modern probability studies, Pascal famously decided it wasbetter for an individual to believe in God even if He may not exist since even alow probability of eternal punishment outweighs the transitory benefits of livingan atheistic life; such as getting your Sunday mornings back. There may be"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"absolutely nothing behind astrology, but there might be, and the ‘compliancecost’ added to your practical enchantment is only marginal. Why take the riskof not having your enchantments come off then?Timing your enchantments requires a stacking of models. At a macro level,the magician should be aware of astrological timing on an annual and monthlybasis, as well as any other systems that may be relevant –such as Armstrong’sECM. The next level down becomes pantheon and even grimoire-specific.Dating as far back as Egypt’s Old Kingdom –I’d argue for a much earlier date,obviously- is the belief that different spirits govern individual chunks of time:decans, days, hours, and so on. Dr Skinner observes that in some traditions, thespirits would not consider the magician to be initiated at all if he or she wouldnot pay due respect to the god or being that rules the hour of your magicaloperation. Pascal’s Wager comes into play once more. Even if the presidingspirit of the hour is not the target of your evocation (and if not, why not?), youare urged to include them in your invocation and/or ritual space creation. Forinstance: “On this day of... in the hour of... I summon...” or “This space ismade on the day of and with the permission of....”Further specifics beyond this point are unhelpful as they depend on thesystem you are working with. Many grimoires have their own system ofday/hour rulership. I personally prefer those in the Hygromanteia or my ownreconstruction of Late Period Egyptian timings. The key is to retain the general‘shape’ of timing in your enchantments.Your Own Sacred CalendarThere is a compound interest effect in sticking to a holy calendar of your owndevising, year after year. In some sense you become the microcosm you wantto see in the macrocosm. Individualising a ritual year affirms the concepts andpeople you hold important or who have otherwise formed you. You becomethe Pharaoh of your own little Egypt, which is a pleasingly Hermetic image.Below is my current ritual year, provided as a serving suggestion only.Your own little Egypt will not be identical to mine, though there may be someoverlap.

Thatway the observation of them can more easily blend into your daily life. Theevents or festivals in my own calendar break into three broad categories:Planet and Off-PlanetSaint DaysHero DaysPlanet and Off-PlanetThis is the category you are unfortunately probably most familiar with fromthe so-called pagan Wheel of the Year. Firstly, it really needs to be said that ifyou want to ‘align’ with the ‘seasonal forces’ of the earth, you are better offgardening, growing as much of your own food as you can and otherwise eatingseasonally and locally than you are indulging in an Edwardian pastoral fantasy.A second category worth exploring despite protestations of appropriation islocal indigenous festivals. (It is worth noting that for the Maori, for instance, ifyou are born in New Zealand regardless of race you are Tangata Whenua or‘people of the land’. Not sure how that becomes appropriative, then.) These arethe stories of the soil you live on and the seas you live beside. Stay away fromthe traditional headdresses and you should be fine.Bridging the gap between planet and off-planet are the equinoxes andsolstices, which are really more solar system events rather than planetaryones. Equinoxes have some sort of liminal power that make them magicallyuseful. Solstices are a lovely excuse for a party, assuming you need one. (Idon’t.) That is how I mark them.The final grouping within this category are astronomical/astrological eventsthat are personally relevant to you that year. You can work these out basedsolely on your sun sign but they deepen in meaning and probably efficacy ifyou make them natal-chart specific. Examples would be the movement of anouter planet into your sun sign or rising sun. I mark these events with some"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"simple rituals of offerings, orphic hymns, incense and so on. When you timethese rituals correctly they strike me as a much better way of experiencing themouthfeel of ‘ancient’ or ‘foreign’ festivals than any attempt to accuratelyreconstruct a Babylonian or Egyptian festival. After all, it was theseastronomical events that were at their core, and I know for a fact you don’town Karnak.Saint DaysHow anyone can claim to be magically sensitive and still declare that ‘theChristians’ simply ‘changed the names’ of ‘pagan’ feast days to make them saintdays is beyond me. This insults the intelligence of these ‘pagan’ ancestors oneclaims to revere as well as the potency of the European magical tradition asexpressed in the stories of the saints.I made it my business to visit dozens of holy places associated with saints –official and unofficial- right across Europe. What you experience is a localisedexpression of magic, mysticism and culture -not some ‘pagan god’ with a ‘newname’ that you think your ancestors were too stupid to tell the differencebetween. (Mine certainly weren’t.)Perhaps more importantly for ritual observation, marking local seasonal orcultural events by saint day provides us access to the intervening one and a halfthousand years of customs associated with the event being observed. These caninclude prayers, the making of fetish objects, traditional foods or songs. Thegoal of having your own sacred calendar is an ever-deepening experience ofthe authentic throughout the years of your life. For me the saints are the bestway into this. Here are the saint days I observe.St Dwynwen – January 25She is considered the Welsh ‘St Valentine’ for her intercessionary powers overaffairs of the heart. But her story is far more interesting, given that she is aDark Age princess from the holy isle of Anglesey and her story involvesmagic potions delivered by angels, lovers turning to ice and the granting ofthree wishes."},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"The ‘thawing of the ice statue’ motif may be calendrically significant.Anyone who has been to Wales in late January will know what I mean.St David – March 1Staying with Wales, we have the country’s patron saint. St David’s Cathedral insouthwest Wales ranks among the ‘holiest feeling’ places I have ever visited.That current of transformative, experimental, early Christianity is everywherefound. The saint’s backstory is filled with a panoply of Celtic mystic wonders;giant gemstones, bees, stags, evil princes. He is half the old and half the new.St David’s final words were to ‘be joyful and do the little things that youhave seen me do’. It is a good day to celebrate life’s quiet wonders.St George – April 23There’s an almost noble subtext in the marking of St George’s Day which is torescue this fascinating warrior saint from Far Right nationalist groups that haveadopted a dead Syrian as their symbol of keeping England white and free offoreigners.St George is a complex motif, containing the vastly ancient iconography ofthe dragon; her destruction and the creation of the world; combined with half-remembered echoes of Eurasian kingship and warrior cults and a deliberateattempt to summon back the might of the Roman Empire.In many ways, it is pleasing to contemplate this polyform while enjoyingits contrast to England’s benign absurdities like bunting, tea and cheese rolling.Walpurgisnacht – April 30Though there is a saint associated with this night, St Walpurga, her influence onthe night is weak. Traditionally this was the evening witches would gather onthe Brocken, in the Harz Mountains, to cavort with and praise the Devil.Very much a party night."},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"St Columba – June 9Hope of the Scots, St Columba was a highborn Irishman who founded an earlychurch community on Iona: an island -speaking from experience- whoseassociation with magic is entirely deserved.Conversion incidents in the days of the early church were essentiallywizard battles.

Anything worked against you just turns to wet spaghettiand falls to earth.If you have some whisky handy on June 9th, raise a glass.St John – June 23/34St John’s Eve must surely qualify as the most magical night of the year. Itgroans under the weight of local customs and folk magic, from hilltop bonfiresto feeding herbs in your garden.St John himself is the white hot heart of post-Christian esotericism. Heretains the headless motif explored in Star.Ships: A Prehistory of the Spirits. It ishis magic that brings the Logos/Christ down to earth via baptism. It is hisiconography hidden in the forest of medieval knightly heraldry and heresy. Hesits precisely opposite Christ in the calendar, atop the accumulation ofdelightful pagan Midsummer survivals. A night not to be missed.The Dog DaysCorresponding with the return of Sirius to the sky in late summer are the dogdays, known for their oppressive heat and risk of illness.A plethora of dog-headed saints fills the calendar at this time, including StChristopher on July 25 or my personal favourite, Saint Guinefort, who is anactual dog, from thirteenth century Lyon."},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"Guinefort was protecting his lord’s son from a viper that had entered theroom while his lord was out hunting. When the lord returned, he saw the roomin disarray and blood dripping from his hound’s jaws. Believing Guinefort tohave slain his son, the lord kills him, only afterwards spying the baby undersome cushions beside a chewed-up viper. Grief stricken, the lord throwsGuinefort down a well and covers him with stones. Thereafter the well becamea site of petition, particularly for mothers seeking protection for their babies.Some of them would leave the sick child at the well overnight with a candle oneither side of its head, not returning until they had burned out. So we may belooking at some sort of Roman Hekate survival given the dog, the well and thetwin torches. (The actual shape of the story is much older -probably Eurasianin origin- as there are versions that replace the dog with a Mongoose in India,for instance.)Regardless, it is a beautiful and moving story to commemorate,particularly for pet owners. August 22 is the local feast day.St Bartholomew – August 24Another canine survival. Bartholomew is said to have converted somewherecalled the City of Dogs, and travelled with cynocephalic companions. His feastday is August 24th.According to José Leitão, this day is marked in northwest Portugal by abeach baptism of children to St Bartholomew against fear and the Devil. In thelargely pre-literate saintly lore of Europe, this makes Bartholomew either acypher for the Devil himself or a means of binding him. Whichever it is, he isworth your consideration.St Cyprian – September 16 - 26Surely requiring no introduction by now, St Cyprian of Antioch has somethingof a tide. Beginning on September 16th with St Cyprian of Carthage, it iscommon in New World traditions to light novenas and mark each day untilSeptember 26th, the feast of St Cyprian of Antioch.

Unsurprisingly, shehas a more Fey/ambivalent –dare I say ‘alien’- vibe but her close associationwith Our Lady of the Rosary provides both spirit world oomph and a system todirect that oomph where it needs to go.Also I really like Portuguese food.All Saints Day – November 1Not just for Halloween hangovers, being up early on a cold Novembermorning is an optimum moment for sensing the presence of the thousands ofmystics and madmen, stretching back into Antiquity, who hold out littlewerelights for our own journey.

The king was dead within a year.The historical provenance of the story that a Freemason pushed through thecrowd at the guillotining of Louis XVI to dip is cloth in the royal blood andshout “Jacques de Molay, thou art avenged” is not particularly good.

Firstly,its founder is still alive and on a purely nominal basis few spiritual systemsoutlive their originators for very long. I think it will beat these odds by virtue ofits built-in emphasis on decentralisation which has been core to its success fromthe very beginning.
