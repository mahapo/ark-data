If you believe that the most complexprocesses we have to deal with are our fellow humans, then greaterbrainpower is available for life’s problems when you anthropomor-phise them.One of the first things you learnin interpersonal relationshipsis how often people behave mechanically.Mechanistic explanations are not distinct from personal ones, they aremerely a subset. If, for example, my car fails to start at times when I’mrushed, the irrational question “how does it know I am in a hurry”may lead to a solution faster than the rational statement “it cannotpossibly know”. The fault will probably turn out to be mechanical, justas human misbehaviour often resolves into “you pressed my buttons”.Irrational thinking can often be the faster route to a rational solution.That is not what I argue in this book.I only want to challenge the commonidea that magic is a dumbing down of science.Any media cynic will tell youthat dumbing down is the keyto material success! No, the point isthat, in terms of the faculties used, magicalthinking is broader, but maybe not as deep.You do not like the fact that a society of rational beingsrewards dumbness. Instead of fretting, just call it ‘Satan’s JewelCrown’. No matter whether you fight it like a preacher, or make a pactwith it like a press baron - in either case you are personifying it, relat-ing to it, and that can be magic.Mr Dukes, why is it that inthis and other writings you insist on personi-fying complex processes as ‘demons’ orspirits’. Isn’t this just a throw-back tosuperstitions of the past?Yo ureally think science is no more than adumbing down of magic?Sciencecannot be dumber than magic, because ithas been so much more materially successful!But we knowthat the weather, or mycar, is only a mechanical phenomenon.

Thanks to his insight, SSOTBME was to play a seminal role in theearly days of the Chaos Magic movement. Others have claimed SSOTBMEas a key influence on the New Age movement of the 80s.THE NEED TO REPUBLISHI heard Richard Dawkins on BBC television last year expressing anxiety atthe rising interest in paranormal pseudo-science, and his theme was taken upby an anxious panel on BBC Radio’s Moral Maze. It sounded like a throw-back to the 50s when people used to believe that magic was a sort of primi-tive forerunner to modern science. Believe that, then any resurgence ofinterest in magical ideas must indeed seem as a reversal of civilisation.I could live with mankind’s final slide into crazed degeneracy, what reallyscared me was this evidence that there were people — otherwise quite intel-ligent — who had apparently not yet read SSOTBME. A new edition wasurgently needed in response to this cry for help.THE NEED TO REVISEAs SSOTBME has been long out of print, all that is really needed is areprint. However, twenty five years have elapsed and the world has evolved.Dukes could rewrite the whole thing and create a new book, but there is acertain interest in returning to source and preserving the original text.So this edition is a compromise. Changes have been made to the text, butthe main updating is appended in additional sections. The changes includeeditorial tidying (with less use of brackets (and footnotes)) and rewording ofsome insupportable sentences. The additional sections are a new introductionand appendices to most chapters.The biggest change is that the content of the old Chapter 9 has beenbrought forward to Chapter 3A to help illustrate the ebb and flow of Magicalthinking and provide further illustration of a Magical as opposed to aScientific theory.PREFACE TO THE REVISED 1998 EDITIONHere is a new, revised edition of a book first published by The Mouse ThatSpins in April 1975 as ‘SSOTBME’ an essay on magic, its foundations, develop-ment and place in modern life.Since then it has run to two English, oneAmerican, two Polish and at least one German edition — and earned manyfriends along the way.HISTORICAL BACKGROUNDThe book was originally conceived in 1974 as an essay to be included withina longer book. Christopher MacIntosh had proposed a collection of essays ontopics such as Tantricism, Zen Buddhism and other exotic religious ideaswhich had been attracting wider interest in the West since the hippy era —and he thought it would be rather interesting to include a piece on WesternRitual Magic. The required contribution was written, but the book idea wasshelved (as it were). That left a nice essay which was worth editing andpublishing in its own right.The publishing house was called ‘The Mouse That Spins’ becauseCompanies’ House would not permit my use of ‘The Imperial PublishingHouse Of Great Britain’ — a name which I considered rather cool and revo-lutionary at the time.It is less easy to explain why the book was originally published anony-mously. So I won’t.Ramsey Dukes was asked to revise the text for this edition, on theassumption that he wrote the essay — however his style was more verbosethan the original (maybe an effect of the corrupting influence of word proces-sors since 1974) so his main additions have been ghettoised into appendedchapters in smaller print in order to preserve the integrity of the original.The essay was written at a time when there was a big gulf between publicideas of the occult — typified perhaps by the film The Exorcist — and whatmagical groups were actually doing. All that was intended was to cast a fresheye across this gulf and see if it bounced. Nice metaphor.It was Gerald Suster who made the perceptive observation thatSSOTBME was “the book that put the magic back into magic”. At that timeserious magic in Britain was heavily under the influence of writers like DionFortune and WE Butler, writers with a strongly psychological approach.Their contribution was crucial for keeping the magical traditions alive duringmaterialistic times, but the downside was that magic came to be practicedmore as a sophisticated form of psychotherapy than as a way of living one’slife.\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0002\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0002\u0003\u0004\u0005\u0005\u0006\u0007\b\t\u0004\u0002\u0004\u000b\u0002\f\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u0002\u0010\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u0002\u0013\u0002\u0014\u0015\u0006\u0002\u0016\u0017\u0004\b\u0006\u000e\t\u0007\u0002\u0018\t\u0019\u000e\r\u000e\u001a\u0002\u0013\u0002\u001b\u001b\u001b\u001c\u0017\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u001d\u001e\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u001c\u0007\u0004\u001e\u0002"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"This book attempts not only to explain the essence of magic, butalso why those marketing specialists feel compelled to justify theiradvice as ‘scientifically sound’, when it is pretty obvious that they andmany others are actually practicing magic.I would like this book to reach out to people who are naturallydrawn to magical thinking, but have been persuaded by our culturethat there is no such thing and, anyway, it is ‘wrong’.It would also be nice if it reaches other people who reject magicalthinking, provided that it explains to them the nature of that rejectedpath, and it thereby saves them from falling into magic unawares.We might all think more clearly if we knew what we were doing.INTRODUCTIONImagine this situation.A well-established manufacturer — let us say a renownedNorthampton shoe maker — is proud of its tradition and reputation,but aware of rising costs and flagging sales: it consults a marketingspecialist and spends a great deal of money for advice which can besummarised as follows.“Your image is far too staid and respectable. You should sharpenit up to appeal to a new, younger customer base. Italicise your logo,use brighter colours, employ more young sales staff and add humourand zip to your promotions.”If challenged to justify such trendy mumbo jumbo, the consultantwould probably get a bit huffy and insist that his company works onsound scientific principles. Pages of statistics, analysis and marketresearch would be produced to justify this claim.But what if the manufacturer had instead consulted a traditionalmagician? He would have been advised as follows. “You need toinvoke the help of Mercury, because he is the god of commerce. Heis also the god of youth, swiftness, communication, trickery and hismagical images use yellow and bright colours. So add a bit of yellowor bright colour to your logo, italicise it to show swiftness, employmore young people, think more youthfully and put some humour andzip into your promotions. Most appropriate of all for a god who rulescommunications — you should create a trendy web site.”The justification may be quite different, yet the actions prescribedare almost identical. So what is going on?The book argues that, to really understand magic and its place inour society, it is more helpful to begin by considering it as a differentway of thinking rather than as a distinct type of activity.If you dismiss, say, Jungian psychological approaches to magicbecause you insist that ‘real’ magic is all about robes, incense, barbaricconjurations and ritual sacrifice, then you are doing no better thansomeone who insists that scientists are not ‘real’ unless they have hairlike Einstein, thick spectacles and white lab coats; or that ‘real’ artistsmust be penniless; or that ‘true’ religious believers must be dogmaticfundamentalists."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"CHAP TER ONEThe basic definition of MagicMagic is a technique by which the human mind attempts to operateupon its world. As such it is similar to Art, Religion and Science, butnote that the term ‘its world’ is meant to embrace not only the phys-ical universe but also all phenomena, objective or subjective, which donot respond to direct control. So it is, up to a point, true to say thatthe above mentioned systems in varying measure are also used tooperate upon the human itself.In what way then does Magic differ from Art, Religion orScience? Obvious practical differences in observed technique suggestthemselves, and yet do not lead us to fundamental distinction whenpursued. We can also attempt to distinguish by saying, for example,that Magic uses ‘mysterious forces’ where Science uses ‘known laws’.But surely that would mean that we would often have to use the word‘Magic’ to discuss future Scientific projects? Although the forces usedby Magicians do not necessarily seem mysterious to the users, thereis a school of thought which would defend the idea that Magic is theScience of as-yet-undiscovered forces. It is an idea which appeals towhat we might (without intended malice) call the ‘pseudo scientists’eg dowsers and anthroposophists. But surely the more fundamentaldistinction lies not in the outward methods, but in the thinkingwhich underlies them?A simple act, such as the lighting of a fire under difficult condi-tions, could be performed in the same skilful way, but according toquite different mental processes. In two of those ways, the Magicaland the Scientific, the outcome might appear to hold more practicalimportance and yet the reasoning is different. The Scientific thinkerwould take trouble to choose dry kindling because, for example, heknows that the latent heat of evaporation of absorbed water wouldhinder ignition; but the Magical thinker would make the same deci-sion because he knows that the elements Fire and Water are antipa-thetic. In the case of the fire ignited as a Religious act, or an Artisticact, the motivation appears less practical and more a result of innerprompting. Although the Religious thinker is more inclined toHe came from an engineering backgroundbut was now passionate about the occult.So I showed him my diagram of the rela-tionship between Magic, Art, Religionand Science.“Sorry” he exclaimed “I’ve no time forputting things into neat little boxes!”I showed him a compass-rose... but he sawneat little boxes.

On the other hand, theArtistic thinker would choose dry wood because it ‘feels right’, areasoning closer to that of the Magician.In distinguishing the modes of thought, we come to a similarconclusion to that of C. G. Jung: that thought is compounded of fourelements which I call intuition, observation, logic and feeling.Two of those are ways in which impressions reach us. In observa-tion they come via the senses, in intuition, they do not; instead theycome via memory or as a sudden ‘inspiration’ — this is not to say thatintuition might not be triggered by the senses.The other two are methods by which the impressions are linked,or manipulated. Logic is well enough understood, but feeling is lesseasy to describe because it is a way of associating ideas using thebrain’s pattern-recognition faculties rather than conscious logic. Assuch it is perhaps best understood inductively by considering variousexamples in the course of this essay — this inductive learning itselfindicates something of the nature of feeling.The biggest difficulty is that other people would use the word‘intuition’ to describe much of what I call feeling, and use the word‘feeling’ to describe emotional responses. Consider this example: on adark night you step on something long and black and it hisses; with-out thinking you have leaped away, and are relieved to discover it wasonly a leaky air hose. In my terminology it is the feeling faculty whichmakes the instant connection between ‘long and hissy’ and ‘danger’,and the sense of alarm is the emotional response to the idea of danger.If, on the other hand, I am sitting in my chair and the phrase ‘longand hissy sanctions danger’ comes to mind, then I would call thatdiscovery an ‘intuition’.Any practical method of thinking demands at least two of thesefour elements, one to serve as an input of impressions and the otherto process them. Artistic thought uses feeling and intuition, Religiousthought uses intuition and logic, Scientific thought uses logic andobservation, and Magical thought uses observation and feeling.This definition of the terms Magical, Artistic, Religious andScientific is due to Lemuel Johnstone, as are the rest of the argumentsand examples of this essay. Although I am happy that they largely -     - reflect the usual meanings of these words, it is possible that the readerwill remain unconvinced, and so the initial capitals will be retainedthroughout this essay as a reminder that all argument will be basedon these definitions. In general, however, the terminology of thisessay will not be strictly defined.The definitions may be summarised in the following diagram.The immediate problem with such a diagram is that the Scientific(in my sense) bias in our culture encourages us to see it as a sort ofclock face onto which we can ‘place’ different disciplines. For exam-ple: in the Science sector, more empirical research into, say, psychol-ogy and sociology would lie far down between 5 and 6 o’clockwhereas purer sciences would lie nearer to 3. Similarly in the Magicsector, astrology and ‘pseudo sciences’ would lie between 6 and 7o’clock, divination and ritual magic between 7 and 8 o’clock, andmagic systems such as that of Austin Spare nearer to 9 o’clock.INTUITIONSCIENCERELIGIONARTMAGICSENSATIONTHINKINGFEELING➩➩➩➩"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":" -     Spontaneous religion and art lie close to 12 o’clock, the moreacademic dogma or political systems lie between 2 and 3 o’clock, andthe art of appreciating art lies between 9 and 10 o’clock.This sort of attribution can, however, be most misleading becausethe diagram is actually meant to be more of a direction indicator —like the compass North/South/East/West in the corner of a map. Inthis case the placing of specific disciplines depends upon where youare standing. A more strictly ‘Scientific’ bias would shift the aboveplacings so that economics and psychology fell into the ‘mumbojumbo’ Magic sector, whilst mathematics would fall with philosophyinto the Religious sector. A more extreme ‘Religious’ bias would lumpa lot of Art and Science subjects in the Magic sector as ‘the Devil’swork’. A more ‘Artistic’ bias would consider astrology and cabalisticphilosophy, for example, to be “all too frightfully Scientific, my dear.”The first misunderstanding which must be dealt with is the impres-sion that the above definition in some way belittles the subjects withwhich it deals. The occultist might accept the Artistic, Religious andScientific placings, and yet object that it is preposterous to ‘lumptogether’ such diverse subjects as astrology, spiritualism and ritualmagic as being ‘just observation plus feeling’. It must be realised thatthe mixtures and interactions of thoughts are so involved that thefour words ‘intuition’, ‘logic’, ‘observation’ and ‘feeling’ are also betterseen as directionsthan ingredients. So to put both astrology and ritualmagic in one quadrant relative to myself does no more to equate themthan does the sentence “Bristol and the Scilly Isles are both SouthWest of Cheltenham” mean that Bristol and the Scilly Isles are in anyother way the same.The involved nature of thinking leads to the second objection:surely I don’t believe that Scientists never use intuition, and Artistsdon’t observe? This is of course blatantly untrue: in any real life situ-ation we will find all four thought processes apparently inextricablymixed. Again, the answer lies partly in remembering that we are talk-ing of directions and not ingredients — so the question is not somuch “what faculties does a scientist use?” but rather “however thediscovery was made, which way is the scientist facing? ie how is thediscovery justified or defended?” -     - So you can determine the basis of a particular action by verballyattacking the perpetrators and asking them to defend their action.However inspirational a Scientific discovery, it will be written up andplaced before the public judgement as an exercise in reason andobservation. Although a painting can be a triumph of acute observa-tion, it is unlikely that the artist will defend it upon such ‘photo-graphic’ grounds.The way in which the basic thought can be detected will becomeclearer later when more examples are considered in detail. So I willend this section with three illustrations of the difference betweenMagical and Scientific thought, with the particular intention of illus-trating further what is meant by ‘feeling’.The first example is very primitive. Imagine two simple peoplewho have both made the same observation, namely that green apples,green plums and old meat which had green mould on it all tended tomake people sick when eaten, and that the sick peoples’ faces took ona greeny hue. One of the two tackles this observation logically, andsets out, for example, with experiments to locate the green substancein these different foods which makes you sick and subsequentlytinges the face. The other uses feeling: he repeats a few experimentsand deduces that greenness ‘goes with’ sickness. The first is thinkingScientifically and the second Magically. Here we can see how Magicis at an advantage in a primitive situation: whilst the first thinker isstill testing erroneous theories, the second has already deduced afairly powerful one: he can proceed to make his enemies ill by serv-ing green food in a room decorated a sickly green.Because we know much more about Science nowadays, it is natu-ral to criticise my conclusion by pointing out that the Scientist willeventually find out very much more, and that the Magician’s rapidconclusion is anyway ‘false’ because there are so many exceptions tothat rule. But this criticism is based on a lack of experience as to howthe Magical way of thought might refine and improve its conclusionsto the same extent that the Scientific can. For a start, the Magicianwould soon identify distinct types of greenness: there is the greennessof decay, the greenness of immaturity and so on.The second example is set in a more familiar situation, but isequally elementary.

Why hasn’t gravitational constant ‘g’ come into myresult?” A mathematician expects to find ‘g’ in such a formula, sonotice that the immediate objection is one of feeling — it doesn’t‘seem right’. But of course the objection will not be accepted by himon those grounds. Instead, he will carefully rework the logic of hiscalculations until the correct answer is achieved. The Magician standsback from his handiwork with relief, then says: “Hang on, I’ve onlygot six candles on the altar. That’s wrong.” Now his objection is alogical one: six is not the number of Venus in the Cabalistic system,but seven is. However, that is insufficient justification for chucking inanother candle. The Magician will savour the atmosphere created inhis Venusian Temple, and if it seems impossible to add a seventhcandle without spoiling the balance and harmony of what he hasalready done, then he will not do so.Whereas the Scientist’s objection of feeling was resolved by theuse of logic, the Magician’s objection of logic was resolved by the useof feeling. In each case, it was the ultimate resort which betrayed thetrue nature.Readers who have read Crowley might wonder how this fourfolddirection scheme stands in relation to his definition of what he called‘Magick’, ie the Art and Science of causing change in conformity toWill. He was in a sense placing himself at the centre and using theword Magick to embrace the whole process of willed action. He addsthat, of all the methods of Magick, only a certain proportion of themare what would traditionally be described as ‘magical’.Crowley was advocating a bringing together of all techniques,scientific and artistic, under the term ‘Magick’ (“the Aim of Religion,the Method of Science” to quote his phrase). If I were intending toproselytise in this essay, a similar line would here be taken. However,I am in fact merely trying to inform the reader about the traditional‘magical’ techniques, and so will restrict the word to the definitionalready given. -     on logical grounds, then you are thinking Scientifically. If instead youaccept your observation and try next time to banish the feeling ofdesperation from your mind in order to avoid red lights, then you arethinking Magically.This statement is of course unfair: a truly Scientific thinker wouldgive observation and logic equal weight at first. He would, therefore,continue by trying in future to collect statistical evidence that acertain degree of despair went with a certain percentage of red lights;but he would have to abandon the search when he found that thisScientific interest merely served to banish his panic. Finding that thedesperate, panicky feeling was too elusively subjective, he woulddeduce that the apparent excess of red lights was possibly also asubjective illusion, and only then would the inquiry cease.However, the example is correct insofar as it illustrates a presentday degeneration of Scientific thought: as a way of thought, Sciencehas become so familiar that it is dogmatic and liable to take shortcuts, and therefore we do find observations being dismissed out ofhand in the course of otherwise ‘Scientific’ thinking.But what of our Magician? Surely he too will find that the elusivepanic vanishes when he takes a Magical interest in it? Precisely, andthus he will conclude that his Magic has ‘worked’. There is no prac-tical way to refute this conclusion. One can only resort to abstractwrangles as to whether there was ever a surfeit of red lights in thepast.The third example is a less elementary one. It is intended to showhow in the ultimate resort we will uncover the two elements of think-ing as described in the definition, even though the other elements areused along the way. As an example of the Scientific thinker, I will takean applied mathematician deducing a formula for the time of flightof a projectile, and for the Magical thought, consider the setting upof a temple to invoke Venus.The Scientist starts from basic known facts about the elements ofhis problem and proceeds to cover sheets of paper with a series oflogical calculations until the desired formula is attained. TheMagician starts from basic known facts about the entity to be invokedand proceeds to decorate a room with all the apparatus, colours,sounds and smells which ‘go with’ that entity until he is satisfied thatthe atmosphere ‘feels right’.

Trusting feeling is not a question of being swept away by it, it is aquestion of giving it as much value as reason and knowing how to use it.The woman’s senses have taken in zillions of bits of data as she opens thatdoor, and her feeling has detected something amiss in the overall pattern. If,instead of dismissing feeling or panicking, she respects it, she will proceedwith caution. She could ask to see his identification documents; she could askhim to remain outside while she phones the Water Board to confirm that aninspector of his description is in the vicinity; she could ask him to return lateror whatever. If she feels something is wrong, I suspect that something iswrong; but it could turn out to be something which poses no immediatethreat to her — for example, the man might be wracked with bitter divorceproceedings and so neglecting his appearance while doing his best tocontinue his job to provide income for his family. She has indeed sensed thatsomething is wrong, but it is not ‘what we might think’.I have made much of this example because I want to suggest that ourbrains have evolved a non-logical data processing facility which is, in its ownway, every bit as useful and sophisticated as reason but which we tend to playdown or analyse away because its causal connections seem so tenuous. Thisfacility, which I called ‘feeling’ acts much faster than reason and seems toprocess vast amounts of data in parallel rather than sequentially like logicalthought. As such it is hard to put into words, the words chosen tend to befeeling words, and the process is more akin to Art than Science.The distinction between this process and what I call ‘thinking’, ‘reason’ or‘logic’ is very close to the distinction that is sometimes made between ‘rightbrain’ and ‘left brain’ processes. So we could define the distinction betweenMagic and Science as follows: “both Science and Magic seek to explore andoperate upon the observed universe, but Magic gives final authority to rightbrain processing, while Science gives final authority to left brain processing”.Returning to the book’s main argument, I suggest that the proper studyof Magic could help us to understand and use these primitive survival skillsto better advantage. In our civilised world we have demoted half our dataprocessing abilities because their main value seems to be to cope with just thesort of sudden, unpredictable situations which we try to eliminate from ourcivilised world. Science is the process by which we try to eliminate the unpre-dictable. Magic is the process by which we could try to woo the unpre-dictable, and it is a great way to restore value to these lost processing skills.The practice and study of Magic can make us a lot less silly about feel-ings and hunches. -      CHAP TER 1AMaking sense of ‘feeling’ and ‘direction’As mentioned in Chapter One, the problem with my use of words is that alot of what I describe as ‘feeling’ other people would call ‘intuition’.On reflection — the sort of thing one gets round to after 30 years — Iwould describe the process which makes instant non-causal connections as‘pattern recognition’ instead of ‘feeling’. But I have retained the word feelingin the rest of the text because people do tend to use that word loosely in orderto distinguish the process from logical analysis.Consider the lone woman opening the door to a slightly scruffy strangerwho claims to be from the Water Board. She senses something is wrong andhas what she describes as ‘a bad feeling’ about the man and she can respondin several ways. One is to shut the door in his face and ring the police.Another is to argue with herself that she should not be such a silly, prejudicedwoman and then let him in without further question.My point is that her ‘bad feeling’ is an immediate sense that the situation— the man, her alone, the request to enter the house — is a pattern which‘goes with’ danger. My argument is that this process deserves more respectthan it sometimes gets.In the second behaviour option, the lady calls this process ‘prejudice’ andover-rules it. Because we are trained to value reason more highly than feel-ing, reason tends to step in and analyse these feeling judgements — eg “dear,me. Why am I feeling insecure just because the man’s shoes are a bit tatty andhe looks a bit scruffy? I am becoming as middle class and prejudiced as myMum!” Reason can nearly always analyse a number of components of anypattern and often is used to dismiss them — eg “scruffy shoes could simplymean poverty, dirty hands could simply mean that he has been turning off astop-cock in the street, a shifty look could simply mean he is awkward aboutasking a lone woman to let him into the house” and so on, until the initialsense of danger begins to look like unthinking prejudice.My argument is that this pattern-recognition process is not so stupid. Ibelieve we have it because it has as much survival value as logical thought. Incases of immediate danger of very rapid decision making it is actually farmore useful than the pedestrian process of logical thought. The reason wevalue logic so much more highly is largely because civilised society allowsfewer such immediate threats than our animal past, and so we have forgottenthe value of such ‘feeling’.What I suggest is that the woman’s initial ‘bad feeling’ is telling her that‘something is wrong’ and that I believe we should learn to trust such feelings.\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0002\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0002\u0003\u0004\u0005\u0005\u0006\u0007\b\t\u0004\u0002\u0004\u000b\u0002\f\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u0002\u0010\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u0002\u0013\u0002\u0014\u0015\u0006\u0002\u0016\u0017\u0004\b\u0006\u000e\t\u0007\u0002\u0018\t\u0019\u000e\r\u000e\u001a\u0002\u0013\u0002\u001b\u001b\u001b\u001c\u0017\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u001d\u001e\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u001c\u0007\u0004\u001e\u0002"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"assistance of a professional proof reader, but this text does aim to dropthe upper case initials when a more accepted usage is implied.We will start with a system closer to the Sciences. Astrology is largelyfounded on observation: feeling, though indispensable in interpreta-tion, comes second. Astrology views events on earth in the largerpattern of the movements of the heavenly bodies. It asserts that, onthe birth of any project, it would be as unrealistic to ignore the posi-tions of the planets as it would be to ignore the immediate environ-ment. In particular, we have Natal Astrology where the project inquestion is the first moment of separate existence of a human being,that is its ‘first breath’. The pattern, or ‘horoscope’, of that moment isstudied in the light of past experience, and it is used as a plan of theindividual’s being, and of its future development.In scoffing at systems of Magic, it is common practice to overlookthe importance of observation to them. In the case of astrology, the‘light of past experience’ does not mean ‘dead traditions’. In any groupof astrologers, you will hear lively discussion of personal observationsas to what characteristics ‘go with’ certain planetary positions. Indeedthis answers the question “what do the astrologers do when a newplanet is discovered?” They look out for consistent events when theplanet is in key positions, and they look back at old horoscopes to seeif the new planet adds any meaning to the old pattern.Another problem which worries those who are ignorant of astro-logical technique is that of the relationships between the astrologicalsigns — Aries, Taurus etc — and the precession of the equinox. Thelabel ‘Aries’ still covers the first twelfth part of the zodiac even thoughit no longer coincides completely with the pattern of fixed stars alsobearing that label, This is especially disconcerting for those whoassume a causal theory of radiating influence from the stars; whatthey overlook is the corresponding evolution over the centuries of theinterpretation of the astrological signs. Although this evolution is ofabout the correct speed to match the progression of the equinoxes, itshould not be assumed that it merely amounts to a rotation so thatthe present day interpretation of Aries is now equal to the old inter-pretation of Taurus. We do not find that Spring is occurring earlierin the year as the equinoxes progress, so accordingly the interpreta-tion of Aries is still largely based on the idea of initiative or first -      CHAP TER TWOExamples of different forms of MagicAt this point, it becomes necessary to describe a selection of tech-niques which would lie in the ‘Magic’ direction of the diagram andwhich are recognised and practiced at the present time. This is neces-sary in order to make it clear that Magic as here defined does in factaccord with the activities popularly associated with that word. On theother hand, there is a danger in picking a few topics from the vastrange of Magical practices and attempting to outline them in a fewwords: it is the danger of fragmenting the subject once again.This fragmentation goes against the spirit of Magic, for one of thequalities which distinguishes feeling from logic is the former’s abilityto process simultaneously a wide range of observations. In studyingthe following examples in greater depth, you will notice a tendencyfor Magic to take a broader and more inclusive view than the concen-trated view of Science.In this sense, we find a very interesting analogy of Magicalthought in the cinema. Imagine the closing scenes of a tragic film thescenes of strife and struggle rushing to a closeup climax of agony-filled faces, then with a sweep of finale music and the camera slowlyreceding from the scene, a wider and further view fills the screen andthe hero is now just a diminishing figure in a larger pattern of sunsetscenery. The cinema’s magic evokes a surge of emotion in its audi-ence, be it sympathy or nausea.Here Art and Magic are in accord while Science and Religion arestill quibbling over the detailed rights and wrongs of the earlieraction. In fact the first symptoms of Magic noticed in any system areoften that it views a pattern too wide to be admitted by Science.A curious note to the above illustration: a very academic rational-ist took exception to it when shown the first edition of this book. Heclaimed that the example was dishonest because it played on differ-ent meanings of the word ‘magic’.

In practice, it ismore likely to be based on the Cabala than pure astrology, but I willinvent an astrological example as it is more likely to refer to symbolsknown to some degree by the reader.Let us say that ‘worldly success’ is desired. What epitomisesworldly success in the horoscope? Perhaps Sun in Leo on the mid-heaven with good aspects especially from Jupiter and Venus? Perhapstherefore we will have Jupiter and Venus in their own signs, ieSagittarius and Libra respectively? There are many other things tolook for — support from the Moon, ie the public, and from Saturnfor a firm foundation — but I will oversimplify for the sake of clar-ity.Ideally you wait for a time when every planet is perfectly placed;practically this is impossible, so you have to compromise. Let usimagine that Sun, Venus and Jupiter are well placed as above, but thatMercury is badly placed in Pisces and receives a bad aspect fromNeptune but a good one from Mars in Capricorn, and that Saturn isterribly placed and has no redeeming good aspects at all.If nothing can be done about Saturn’s bad influence, it had betterbe cut out. (I admit that ‘influence’ is not the ideal word — there isno assumption of a causal influence here. The ‘bad influence’ is a badinfluence on the pattern — just as a heavy moustache might be a badinfluence upon the composition of the Mona Lisa. So read thispassage as one might read an art criticism.) Thus the temple furnish-ings should omit the use of black or Saturnine colours, and the riteshould include actions and phrases to banish Saturn’s influence fromthe place of working. In later life, this might correspond to a need toleave old people, traditions and delays out of your plans for success.The bad influence of Mercury and Neptune all indicate a dangerfrom treachery, so do we banish these two as well? Here is a decision:the more we banish, the less of the whole picture is left to support us.Better therefore to try to deflect their influence via Mars’ good aspect. -      growth; and so on with the other signs in their cyclical relationship toAries.Some astrologers like to see themselves as Scientists, and quotethe increasing importance of statistical analysis to their system. Tosome astrologers, statistics is as important as it is to some economists— so why not admit astrology to be a Science? Because astrologydoes not depend upon a causal link between the planets and theearth, the lack of a causal link is a break in the chain of logic — ie itis not logic. Feeling does not need that causal link. As a Scientist, theeconomist should use statistics to indicate correlations which canthen be explored for causal links before proceeding further. If heomits that stage and relies on statistical correlation alone, he is slip-ping into Magic. Myself, I would be happier to admit sociology andpsychology to the Magic sector than to place astrology in the Sciencesector.Tarot divination is a system where feeling plays a much larger partrelative to observation. Whereas the astrologer looks at his client’s lifeas the smaller event in the larger context of cosmic patterns, the tarotreader studies a smaller event (ie the resultant order of a pack of shuf-fled tarot cards) in the larger context of his client’s life.The cards bear complicated pictorial symbols. Although the finalspread is simpler than a horoscope — that is to say, there are fewerpossibilities for interaction — the original symbols are far morecomplicated than the astrological ones. Thus the statistical method ofalmost pure observation does not lend itself to the learning of thetarot pack. Instead, it is necessary to feel your way around the symbolsby meditation, and to supplement that meditation by observation ofanalogies in everyday life. Thus you learn what cards ‘go with’ whatcharacteristic patterns in life.I myself had difficulty interpreting tarot spreads at first. It wasonly after I had used them as prompts for telling bed-time stories tomy baby that I formed a working relationship with the symbols. Iused to lay four cards face down and turn them over one by one,making up a story as I did so. It was easy because it felt like ‘play’. Inthis way I stopped ‘trying to see meaning’ but simply allowed thepictures to stimulate my imagination — and that way I learnt tointerpret divinatory spreads. -     - \u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0002\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0002\u0003\u0004\u0005\u0005\u0006\u0007\b\t\u0004\u0002\u0004\u000b\u0002\f\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u0002\u0010\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u0002\u0013\u0002\u0014\u0015\u0006\u0002\u0016\u0017\u0004\b\u0006\u000e\t\u0007\u0002\u0018\t\u0019\u000e\r\u000e\u001a\u0002\u0013\u0002\u001b\u001b\u001b\u001c\u0017\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u001d\u001e\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u001c\u0007\u0004\u001e\u0002"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"which substances are brought to perfection, or at least a ‘higher’ stateby first breaking them down to their simplest parts and then rebuild-ing them.

There are occultists who refrain from theparaphernalia and deliberate strivings of Ritual Magic and yet whobring about desired events by a careful manipulation of subtle princi-ples which are deduced from feeling their way around observed facts.For example, they might note the same moment of time describedabove for Ritual Magic and use it to precipitate success, not by adramatic ritual but by the rather more mundane arrangement ofcircumstances for that day — so that all possible other interpretationsof those astrological aspects are rendered unlikely, and that thesuccess of a particular project is the only remaining channel for thefulfillment of those aspects.The Magic of Austin Spare is the example of such a ‘pure’ system. Headmits the subjectivity of our beliefs and desires, then extends thissubjectivity by indicating the extent to which even our surroundings -      Mars in Capricorn is a severe position — in later life, it might corre-spond to the deflection of trickery by taking a hard, even cruel line.So where the furnishings reflect Mercury, by tradition for example inthe magician’s sandals and the words spoken, we will try to alignthem with the helpful Martian element. For example, to protect thefeet (Pisces) from. treachery (Mercury) while dancing the ritual, wewill make sure the sandals are securely fastened with iron (Mars)buckles.As can be imagined from these examples, the possible precautionsare endless. But what do they add up to? The Magician now has atime and a place which is perfectly attuned to arouse in his ownthinking the full spirit of worldly success with the result that he willachieve during his ritual the feeling of complete worldly success.In this sense, he has basically done no more than the host whoplans a party: a place and time are chosen, and the place is decoratedso as to play up its amusing and party-like aspects, and to cover upthe grimmer aspects by tidying them away. Thus the good party spiritis invoked to the gathering. But that is not the end of it, for the partywill provide happy memories and will lead to new friendships andfurther invitations. Nowadays there is also the ‘magical’ possibility ofcapturing the spirit of the event in some photographs, or a taperecording. If this is done, the host will be able to revive the occasionfor years ahead, bringing out the photos to show to friends and oncemore they are all laughing.The Ritual Magician too likes to capture his spirit in a talisman.His system predates photography or the tape recorder; he will preparean ‘amulet’ as carefully as he decorated his room. Perhaps the amuletwill take the form of a disc of gold (Sun) supported in a ring of tin( Jupiter) and on a copper (Venus) chain. On it will be inscribedsymbols — the horoscope of the moment, for example — whichcompletely summarise his ritual. After the ceremony, this talismanwill be carefully stored away to be produced and used only when thespirit of worldly success is most needed. Like the perfect host, heknows the talisman or photos would lose their effect if just leftaround the place for twenty-four hours every day.Nowhere is the interplay between observation and feeling morevividly seen than in the study of alchemy.

In fact thisbook had an important influence upon that current because it presented acomparatively clear and undogmatic overview of basic Magical principles,and that is very much what chaos magic is all about.It should be growing clear by now that dogmatism has absolutely noplace in Magic, whereas in Religion (and in Science as will be explained inCap 3A) it has such a key role that it needs to be very carefully monitored.Simply because dogmatism has no place in Magic, it is traditionallywelcomed in as guest of honour.So a typical introduction to astrology might well begin with the dogmaticstatement “We are, every one of us, under the influence of the stars...” eventhough a majority of astrologers think in terms of synchronicity or cyclesrather than influences, and those who do work with an influence model arefar more likely to use planetary than stellar influences.Another Magical book might begin with a statement such as “Beyondthe realm of the senses there exist dark forces which govern this world,mighty powers mastered by a priestly caste before the Fall using secretknowledge which has since been available to a select few who hold the keysto the most secret inner temples of the adepti...” Terrific stuff, and damngood Magic for those lucky enough to be able to swallow all that.Unfortunately for Magic, however, our Scientific education has somewhatconstricted the throat against such stuff. Science values truth as highly as thefinest wine — to be sipped not gulped — while Magic is more inclined toknock truth back with gusto and then concentrate on sipping at whateverexperience then results.Chaos magic allows for such modern sensibilities by putting the dogmathrough a blender. A typical eight word blender is “Let us adopt a beliefsystem in which...” and then follows the above crap about dark forces. Theword “paradigm” makes a useful blender for over-Scientific sensibilities.What the chaos magician is putting into practice is Austin Spare’s principleof acting “as if ”. As will be explained in my example in Chapter 3A, thecorrect approach to a Magical theory or model is not to seek to disprove it asone would with a Scientific theory, but to see if you can convince yourself thatit is true by acting as if it was true. If this results in the theory ‘working’, thenyou rejoice in it as a practical tool. What you do not do is assume thereforethat it must be ‘true’ in any significant sense. It is actually better Magic to -     - and circumstances can be seen as a projection of forgotten or uncon-scious beliefs and desires. So to admit and neutralise those beliefswhich limit us is to alter one’s circumstances for the better.Alternatively, if we can replace the destroyed belief with a new onesuitable for a desired state (eg replace an unconscious belief that ‘I wasjust born unlucky’ by one that ‘I am bound to make it someday’) andwe can succeed in moving that belief away from the ineffectiveconscious state and down into the effective unconscious state, thenwe can alter our circumstances. Here we are close to the alchemicalidea of first reducing to simplicity before rebuilding. Spare’s system isstrongly akin to the principles of much New Age teaching, but thepractice looks very different.The handful of examples that have been given must not be seen as asurvey of Magic, nor as a full explanation of what each example isabout. Its purpose is, on the one hand, to provide illustrations of howdiverse in outcome the combinations of observation and feeling canbe, for the sake of those who have no knowledge of Magic; and onthe other hand, to show that the original definition is found to coverthe whole range of Magical method, for the sake of those who alreadyhave some knowledge of Magic and might therefore not be happywith that definition.Magic processes data in parallel (ie as ‘sympa-thies’) where Science would process data insequence (ie as ‘causes’).Thus sympathetic Magic is the core of all Magic.To invoke a god or spirit you bring togetherqualities, objects and actions sympathetic to thatspirit. To precipitate an event you bring togethergods and spirits sympathetic to that event.\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0002\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0002\u0003\u0004\u0005\u0005\u0006\u0007\b\t\u0004\u0002\u0004\u000b\u0002\f\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u0002\u0010\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u0002\u0013\u0002\u0014\u0015\u0006\u0002\u0016\u0017\u0004\b\u0006\u000e\t\u0007\u0002\u0018\t\u0019\u000e\r\u000e\u001a\u0002\u0013\u0002\u001b\u001b\u001b\u001c\u0017\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u001d\u001e\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u001c\u0007\u0004\u001e\u0002"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"make to improve the feeling’, coupled with a presumption that getting thisright feeling in the environment will go with corresponding greater successor harmony in life and business. As such, Feng Shui is very much a Magicalprocess.In practice, however, Feng Shui became highly systematised with rulesand correspondences. The traditional Feng Shui compass looks like a preci-sion Scientific instrument until you analyse the way it is used. Superficially,then, Feng Shui might appear almost Scientific to the lay person. How canthis happen?I believe it is a manifestation of a cultural evolution which is described inChapter 3A. Times change and different ways of thinking come and go.When Religion is dominant, it tends to overlay Magical practice and you getall the prayers, psalms and conjurations of the traditional grimoires. Whenrationalism takes over there is an urge to systematise and try to ‘pin down’ thisfeeling of ‘what goes with what’, and we inherit the highly complex tables ofcabalistic correspondence, and the rules of Feng Shui.This is another example to illustrate that the four ways of thinkingdescribed in this book are four directions, and not tidy categories. Much ofwhat I call “Magic” presents itself as pseudo-science or pseudo-religionbecause those are the forms in which it was accepted in the past. But if youstrip away appearances and techniques and look at the basic thinking behindthem, you recognise them as Magic in my terms.From Feng Shui we come to another phenomenon which has emerged since,and partly because of, the first edition of this book. The ‘New Age’ is asubject of such breadth that it is not so much a branch of Magic as a a paral-lel to it. On the one hand it might seem to be just another word for Magic,on the other hand it can appear as a rival system of thought quite opposed inspirit. For this reason I am leaving the discussion of the New Age toAppendix B. -  keep the discovery to oneself than to evangelise or announce it publicly as ifit was a Religious or Scientific truth.By spelling out so clearly the “as if ” process, and wrapping it in semi-Scientific terms such as ‘belief systems’ or ‘paradigms of choice’, chaos magicprovides almost bomb-proof defence against the sort of delusions which usedto befall inexperienced dabblers in Magic. Chaos magic is, in effect, the safestMagical system there is. Paradoxically, however, it has gained a red hot repu-tation for being the most dangerous, sinister and crazed form of Magicalmadness extant. How can this be?I believe this is a simple matter of human psychology. What happenswhen you force motorcyclists to wear helmets and protective clothing? Theanswer is that they go faster. And when cars are provided with seat belts,crumple zones, better tyres and air bags — people drive even faster still. It isprecisely the bomb-proof intellectual basis of chaos magic which makes it sosecure and which therefore tempts its practitioners to rush in where angelsfear to tread — invoking every weird and awesome entity in the pantheonand inventing even weirder ones to feed the need for speed!To pursue chaos magic is to ride the comet’s tail — and it is great fun.Having such a shameless, wicked reputation is even greater fun.The remarks on tarot divination can, of course, be generalised to embrace therunes, geomancy symbols, tea-leaves or any other divinatory system.Reduced to essence it is this: we seek an answer to a question and webelieve that there is a greater intelligence which knows the answer better thanus (and we may choose to believe that the intelligence lies within us or with-out). In theory we could simply sit and meditate and hope to speak directlyto that intelligence. In fact the signals are very weak, so weak that we chooseto amplify them by superimposing random noise in the form of shuffledcards, yarrow stalks or the swirlings of tea leaves — examples which seem todeliver about the right level of noise to resonate with psychic data. Scientistsdeny the value of this amplification technique even though they find it prac-ticed in nature, where random noise is used to resonate with weak signals andmake them easier to detect.The purest form of divination, in this sense, is that practiced by Chaosmagicians when they use a tv screen as a ‘crystal ball’. The tv is switched toan un-tuned channel to deliver a screenfull of random video noise, and theMagician gazes at this screen until the mind begins to discern images in thechaos.Feng Shui is another example I will add to the list as it has become morepopular in the West in recent years. The very essence of Feng Shui, as I seeit, is to ask ‘does this location feel right and, if not, what adjustments can we -     - "},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"sodium chloride contains chlorine. With this sort of belief, thedabbler will mechanically re-enact an empty ritual.He may have some success. Although the attribution of Venus tosandalwood is not as rigid as the chemist’s dogma, it does have thepower of the wine merchant’s quiet reference to the price of the wineyou are raising to your lips. So it is possible for the link betweenVenus and sandalwood to be formed in your mind simply through anawe of your sources of reference. However a more correct approachwould be to use the reference as a guide and to supplement the verynecessary awe with personal experiment and a refining of the attribu-tion with such subjective observations as “Yuck: the combination ofsandalwood and sweaty armpits really turns me off.”More commonly we see such errors when people approach astrol-ogy in insufficient depth. It is easy to conclude that “Venus equals mylove life” and to make a lot of erroneous predictions on that idea. Infact the astrological significance of Venus relates also to art, socialpleasures, women, possessions and many other subjects. Conversely,you will find essential facets of love life referred to other planets, egpassion to Mars, moods to the Moon. So the correct approach to thisextraordinary hotch-potch of attributions is not the dogmatic ‘Venusequals love life’, but rather a gradual accumulation of experience andreflection until the diverse elements begin to fit together, to ‘feelright’. Only when that stage is reached is prediction worth attempt-ing, and it is done by recognising the wide range of possible inter-pretations of any one aspect, and allowing the multitude of otherfactors to play upon that range until a most likely outcome is indi-cated.A less direct manifestation of this error is seen in the mistakenbelief (prevalent among journalists) that a collection of stories ofinexplicable events amounts to a ‘case for Magic’, or conversely thatstories of unsuccessful laboratory tests on psychic phenomenaamount to a ‘case against Magic’. Such stories can only sway the beliefof those who are in a particular state of half-way doubt. The test of aMagical theory is not whether it fits a hotch-potch of ‘objective facts’thrown at you from hostile sources, but whether it fits your own expe-rience.So in place of the ‘accepted body of Scientific truth’, Magic’s truthis ultimately subjective, even though members of any one Magical -     CHAP TER THREEHow Magic diverges from ScienceSo far, Magic has been described without reference to ‘supernaturalforces’, ‘higher worlds’ or ‘powers of darkness’. The danger in omit-ting such references is the danger of presenting Magic to look toomuch like ‘common sense’.It is not that there is not a very large element of ‘common sense’in Magic, it is rather the way in which we tackle naked common sensethat makes it desirable to cloak it in mystique.Until one is practiced in self observation, it is easy to forget theextent to which Scientific thought dominates present day thinking,and thus often manages to rule it. A very natural twentieth centuryreaction to a meeting with common sense is “can’t we tackle this morescientifically?” The result is a proliferation of ludicrous or ineffectual‘-ologies’, ‘-onics’ and ‘-etics’. Therefore it is necessary to explain insome detail how Magic diverges from other systems — in particularfrom Science as the most familiar to us — in order to explain thefutility of attempting to ‘approach Magic scientifically’.The first difference to note between Magic and Science stems fromthe subjectivity of feeling when compared with logic. This is not tosay that feeling is utterly independent of objective influence: the wineyou sample at the wine merchant is liable to taste better for theknowledge that it is the most expensive wine on their list. Sciencerecognises an objective body of truth, or at least accepted dogma, andnot even the most consistent work will be admitted by Scientistsunless it has links with this accepted truth. This is another reason whyastrology cannot be called a Science.You do not find a Scientist gazing in scornful disbelief at a heapof snow white sodium chloride crystals saying “no-one can kid methere’s chlorine in that stuff.” Chemical theory says there is chlorine,and that is that. It is a common mistake to approach Magic in thesame gullible spirit.

He did the spell, she was cured. If it wasa coincidence, it doesn’t matter just so long as he can bring about suchcoincidences.In fact such perfect Magical thought is rare; in the present age,the Magicians are inclined to limit themselves to some degree underthe influence of the idea of causality. As is usually the case, theirresults are in accord with the limitations of their thinking. In pastages, Religious thought dominated with its emphasis on morality,and accounts survive of miracles which defy causality but bow tomorality — gold coins, for example, which materialise from thin airbut do their owner no good unless spent upon charity. Nowadays theMagician will find morality becoming less of a limitation, but he isunlikely to find that his spells will defy causality — eg instead ofmaterialising gold coins, he might have ‘luck’ on a state lottery.Instead of defying causality, modern Magic tends to stretch itslowly, within the operator’s subjectively conceived world. A typicalexample of this is seen in the different attitudes that are held towardsdivination as a student Magician progresses. The first theory adoptedis usually some form of direct causality; a belief that there might berays from the planets which affect us, or that the impressive symbolsof the tarot pack so mesmerise us that we will tend to make thepredictions come true by our own belief in them. Such a theory is thenatural choice of an inexperienced modern, but it tends to comeunstuck as practical experience is gained — by this I mean workingexperience, not just a trek round the different consultant astrologers.The results and the methods used both diverge from that basictheory.A typical ‘second generation’ Magical theory of divination is thatthe unconscious part of the brain is vastly greater than the consciouspart, and therefore has terrific potential for computation. Thus, if aproblem of the future is presented in appropriate symbolic terms, themost likely outcome can be computed by the unconscious. So thenecessary symbols for divination should be those sufficiently vague orinflexible for the unconscious to be able to project its conclusions intothem — to be read by the groping consciousness. But again workingexperience will tend to erode such a theory, not by actively defying it,but rather by slowly stretching the apparent powers of the uncon- -     school may share many elements of that truth. In view of this fact, itseems paradoxical that the subjective Magical truths should be muchless time-dependent than the objective Scientific truths: the earlytwentieth century Magicians who tended to talk in terms of ‘ethericvibrations’ and the ‘fourth dimension’ were still happy to useRenaissance, mediaeval or even classical textbooks, whereasScientists’ textbooks are liable to be obsolete within a decade.It is tempting to note the obsolesence of Scientific theory asreason not to ‘believe in’ Science — “if every past Scientific theory hasnow been proved false in some degree, then we can deduce anextreme likelihood that today’s Scientific theories must also be false.”The problem with that argument is that it requires acceptance of thelatest theories in order to prove that previous theories were false, andso to deduce that the latest theories should not have been accepted.Instead I simply use the word ‘progressive’ to distinguish Scientifictheories from Magical ones — see Chapter Seven.The second important difference between Magical and Scientificthought lies in the attitude to causality. A primitive Magician of thekind imagined in earlier examples might well be baffled as to how thepedestrian processes of logic could ever come to be applied usefully tooperations upon the real world. If he pursued his inquiries, he wouldperhaps conclude that the Scientific mind had solved the problem bya process of ‘projection’. It was projecting the logical links of itsthought processes onto the physical world and thus observing a seriesof links, ie ‘causes’, in that world. A more sophisticated Magicalexplanation would refer to the congruence of Microcosm andMacrocosm, ie ‘inner’ and ‘outer’ worlds, and conclude that: a)because it is possible for our minds to reach conclusions by a series oflogical linked steps, b) therefore it is natural to assume that a similarprinciple or ‘causality’ can operate in the physical world.In this century we are heavily steeped in Scientific thought. Eventhough this does not mean we are all good Scientists, it certainly doesmean that we find it hard to understand how other ways of thoughtcould operate. This is particularly true when we approach a Magicianand find that he has no interest in causality. A practicing Magicianhas no interest in the philosophical problems which torment theScientist who asks “Are you sure it was your Magic that cured her? -     - "},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"Scientist:“I suppose it was because it forced you to get offyour backside and actually do something symbolic about your condi-tion.

The good impression you’ve made on yourboss, and others, is subtly reflected in their descriptions or memo-randa about you. When asked to list candidates, your name comesfirst to his mind, and therefore is remembered by others; and so on,once the ball is rolling.”Of course this Scientist is rapidly ceasing to talk like a Scientist— Magic has that effect on rationalists! But this process of trying toapproach a feeling-judgement by a series of small causal links can bequite a useful exercise for a Magician, and also a possible approach tothe understanding and trust of feeling.In view of this example, you might think that a Scientist couldeasily come to terms with Magic by using such an approach. But thisis far from the case, for if we invert the example with respect to timeand present a Magician who is planninga Magical operation andadvocatingit by the same listing of the possible causal benefits, thenwe find that as the suggested causal links grow more and more tenu-ous there will come a point where the Scientist thinks that theplanned operation is ridiculously optimistic.If we accept that everything is linked with everything else, thenbetween any two events which ‘feel’ associated, there will be an infi-nite series of possible causal links which can be discovered in this way.As each link becomes more and more tenuous, we could symbolisethose links by a series of numbers 1/2, 1/4, 1/8, 1/16 etc. Now thisseries 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 +... if added indefinitely tends to the limit total -     scious until they pass the bounds of our belief; that is, they present uswith an unconscious more powerful than can be tolerated, by ourother beliefs about the structure of the brain. After that, the nextgeneration of theory is of an acausal connective principle, egsynchronicity.The main lesson from this for the progressive Magician is thatMagic, like Science, is reluctant to shatter our basic beliefs.Therefore, it is desirable to choose the most flexible possible beliefsfor our working, because such beliefs allow more room for things tohappen.Because we are so steeped in the idea of causality, it is correct that Ishould approach the Magical position from a starting point of causal-ity, even though it is ultimately irrelevant. So in answer to the ques-tion “what does the Magician have in place of an idea of causality?”,I will answer that the Magician does not deny a connection betweenevents, but rather assumes that every event is connected to everyother. This assumption makes the search for a chain of causes ridicu-lous: the links are too numerous and complex for analysis.Of course, this assumption is ultimately true even in Scientifictheory: a flea jumping in the most distant galaxy exerts a possiblegravitational effect on this world which could be expressed mathe-matically even though it is too small ever to be measured. However,reason plus observation cannot as a team handle more than a smallfinite number of factors.As an illustration of this, it is often instructive to consider how aScientist analyses a successful Magical operation.

Therefore he isirritated to hear the Magician’s apparently woolly associations ofVenus with women, love, copper, green and other irrelevant human-centric qualities. To the Scientist, these attributions are a relic of atime when uneasy ignorance was disguised behind imagination.To the Magician, this is all absurdly, though disarmingly, idealis-tic. The Scientist sees the universe as an absolute and real world ofTruth, partly discovered and largely still to be discovered, and he crit-icises the Magician’s view of the world as being a subjective versionof the true world which has been distorted by the Magician’s ownimagination and gullibility.

To the Magician, this is all very idealistic butmuch less trustworthy than those attributions of Venus which havebeen previously discovered, implanted or encouraged in his ownmind. Instead of quoting distant authorities, he is describing what heknows well through experiments in the ‘laboratory’ of his own mind.As said before: it is wrong to think that the Magician blindly acceptsthe attributions he reads in old textbooks; unless such attributions areaccepted and ‘charged’ by the Magician, they are liable to be useless.Although you may hear of dabblers who get results through themechanical performance of an old ritual, such workings do no moredeserve the title of Magic than does an inadvertently ignited stick ofdynamite deserve to be described as a ‘Scientific Investigation ofDetonation’.Let us conveniently accept the Scientist’s assertion that allthought processes are chemical and electrical reactions within thebrain. In that case, even the Scientist’s concept of Venus is only to beexperienced in the form of such reactions.

This fact is what is perceived by the feeling of the Magicianwhereas the Scientist is analogous to the person who stops at, say,1/512 because it is “surely too small to make any difference.”The method of Science demands that we stop after a finitenumber of factors have been considered in relation to a problem, andignore for the time being all further factors, But in Magic, the endpoint is sensed and ‘achieved’ through a seemingly irrelevant ritual.Of course, this example is poor because the actual series 1/2 + 1/4+ 1/8 + . . . is a series of like terms — real numbers — and so couldbe handled by the Scientist using the mathematical methods forconvergent series. But in real life, the series are of unlike terms, egpersonal psychological effects, resultant effects on associates, result-ant sociological effects, economic effects, etc.The distaste that a Scientist has for Magical method also arises at adeeper level than that of a mere rejection of insufficient causal links:it arises on account of the previously mentioned dichotomy betweenthe Scientist’s objective world and the subjective Magical one. I wasonce told that the basic objection which the Inquisition had toGalileo’s theories was not, as is popularly supposed, because heclaimed that the earth went round the sun, but rather because heinsisted that this was an absolute and objective fact which reallyhappened ‘out there’. In other words, he was granting to a piece ofknowledge the absoluteness which was considered only proper for aGod. This absolute belief appears to be basic to Scientific thinkersand makes it very hard for twentieth century man to accept the moreconvenient and adaptable beliefs of Magicians.Let us say that a Magician has invoked Venus in a ritual to securethe love of a chosen girl, and that he has been stupid enough to let aScientist know of his action. As would be expected, the Scientistwould want to know how a planet could affect the love of a girl, andan argument would begin on the lines described above: the Scientistadmitting that the ritual might boost the Magician’s confidence andmake him more attractive, but not admitting much more.But if the argument is pursued, it will be found that the twothinkers are not in fact arguing about the same Venus, even thoughthey can both point to the same heavenly body as they use the word.To the Scientist, Venus is an objective reality, a vast mass of mineral -     - "},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"ignores the physical world — it merely views it in a different mannerand one which will be expanded in a later chapter. This difference ofviewpoint is not easily understood by the Scientist, and its manifes-tation continually surprises.For example, we are so used to thinking of the universe as a vastunexplored mass of facts, and of Scientific discovery as the harvest-ing process which goes out and collects these facts to feed ourexpanding growing knowledge, that the Magical view of this sameprocess seems absurd. The Magical view is that the whole universe isalready explored — by the imagination. Everything that is necessary,and more, is already known. To the Magician, Science or any othersystem of practical discovery is not so much a harvest as a slaughter:once upon a time the Moon was the left eye of Horus, a wickedwoman, green cheese, an inhabited world like ours, the abode of thedead . . . in fact an infinity of different things according to our psychicneeds at the time. Science has cut down most of the possibilities leav-ing only those which start with the idea of a sterile lump of mineral.In my own view, it is still possible for the Moon to be a rich sourceof diamonds. In due course, Science is sure to kill that one too. In thismanner, Science is not adding to our world as the Magician would seeit; on the contrary, it is clearing it in order to make us feel moresecure. So the irrational feeling which haunts some of us — the feel-ing that Science is shrinking the world and making it more boringand empty — is possibly a betrayal of a suppressed inclinationtowards the Magical way of thought.As was earlier suggested, there is a large element of common sense inMagic, and at first glance its techniques might seem as though theycould even be compatible with Scientific thought. In order to dispelthat idea, the basic ways in which Magic and Science diverge havebeen illustrated at length.Science, rather than Art or Religion, was chosen as a comparison.because we are all to some extent biased towards the Scientificmanner of thought in this century, and so at least these illustrationsare more likely to be understood from that angle. This same bias alsomeans that we are more likely to attempt to fit Magic into theScientific way of thought, because the latter is natural to us.

Is it really to be believed that all the separate elec-trical and chemical impulses are contained within the same smalllump of matter and yet in no way interact with one another? What isso strange, therefore, in stirring up one complex of associations, ieVenus, in order to influence another, ie the girl as experienced?There are many people whom I would describe as Scientificthinkers but who would themselves scoff at any such label, merelywishing to be described as ‘down to earth’. Such people would ask:why go to all that trouble to attract that girl by working on compli-cated symbols? Wouldn’t it be simpler just to work on the girl herself?If it was simpler to work on the girl herself, then the Magicianshould have chosen to do so, for in Magic less so than in Sciencethere is no virtue in doing this in a roundabout way simply in orderto experiment. But the questioner shows a typically Scientific fallacywhen he assumes it would be simple to work on the girl herself. TheMagician is in fact being much more realistic when he admits thateven the simplest girl is vastly more complex than any symbol systemhe can devise. Even though to the Scientist the ramifications of theMagician’s Venus symbolism may seem desperately more involvedthan his basic idea of ‘the girl’, in fact the purpose of such Magicalsystems as astrology and the cabala is to provide the necessarylanguage in order to simplify the confusion of symbols.The Scientific method is hopelessly out of depth in the real lifebusiness of seduction. The fact that Scientists ever succeed at it canonly be proof that the heat of emotion is sufficient to banish theScientific Spirit, and to allow the unconscious Magical abilities totake over.The ‘down to earth’ man would argue that both Scientific thoughtand Magical ritual were irrelevant to seduction all they could ever, dois to give the man confidence so that ‘It’ could work unhindered. TheMagician would gladly agree, insisting only that ‘It’ was Magic.So we see again how the Magician thinks in the Microcosm and theScientist in the Macrocosm, and we see the danger of interpreting theterms Microcosm and Macrocosm too unsubtly as the ‘inner world’and the ‘outer world ‘.

In Scientific terms these could define arelationship between the two, summarised as a table of distinctions alongthese lines — — and so on.Relationship by distinction is a particularly Scientific notion of relation-ship. As Magical thinking relies more on spacial, pattern recognition abili-ties, it is more inclined to ask where Magic ‘stands relative to’ Science. Thisis a different approach to relationship. Although this version of relationshipmay be too woolly for strict Scientific analysis, many Scientists would stillchoose to answer the question, and they would often do so by saying thatMagic was ‘a primitive forerunner of Science’.This was certainly what I was encouraged to believe in my childhood inthe 1950s: that Magic was originally a prehistoric, uneducated attempt tomake sense of, or control, the environment. It was suggested that Magic thenevolved in two different directions: towards the spiritual discipline ofReligion and to the technological discipline of Science. This belief meantthat any resurgence of interest in Magic could be seen as dangerous or at leastthreatening — because it was evidence of regression towards our less civilisedpast.This view of Magic seems to be making a comeback. In early 1997Richard Dawkins gave a lecture on BBC TV in which he expressed misgiv-ings about public irrationalism. He drew attention to programmes like The Xattempts. I am not moralising — there is nothing wrong in trying tobe Scientific about Magic, in fact the attempt could teach the exper-imenter a lot about himself. But it would be a mistake for him tobelieve that he was doing Magic in the attempt, or learning anythingpositive about Magic.The journalistic ideas of a ‘war’ between, say, Science and Religionor Magic and Science is rubbish in these terms. Science, Art, Religionand Magic can happily co-exist without impinging upon each other.Like Earth, Air, Fire and Water — or better still North, South, Eastand West — you can combine or confuse them as much as you like,but it will always be possible to separate out these vectors once more,untouched by each other’s proximity. -     - FAC TO RAimObjectivityCausalityBeliefTruthSCIENCE TruthYe sYe sConditionalAbsoluteMAGICWholenessNoNoUnconditionalRelative"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"century, and again it was a reaction following triumphant Victorian Scientificmaterialism.These observations and reflections lead to my theory of cycles of thoughtwhich I expand in this chapter — rather than deferring it to Chapter Nineas in the original SSOTBME. I do this in order to introduce a fuller exam-ple of a Magical theory in preparation for Chapter Seven. So the followingdescription must be followed as a Magical theory, and not as a Scientific one— which is to say the reader must focus on verification rather than falsifica-tion.VERIFICATION NOT FALSIFICATION IN MAGICAL THEORYWhat follows is an example of a Magical theory.It begins with an observation of mine own inner state, and the recogni-tion of a cyclical pattern of development. (The pattern is said to be ‘recog-nised’ rather than ‘discovered’, because the latter would imply the moreScientific notion that it ‘really existed’, whereas Magic is less botheredwhether it is true or imposed as long as it can be experienced.) I then go onto recognise a similar cyclical pattern occurring at several levels in society.Several benefits are gained from this exercise, including: a sense of powerfrom understanding the chaos of history; a sense of superior perception overRichard Dawkins to balance the recognition that he is a more successfulwriter than myself; and finally the provision of material for this book.(Recognition of these benefits helps define this as a Magical as opposed toan Artistic process.)The process of pattern recognition requires us to lay aside the criticalanalytical faculty, but it does not require us to reject it outright. Once apattern has been recognised you can always choose to analyse it, but there islittle point in looking so closely that you no longer see the pattern. That iswhy I ask the reader to focus now on verification, not falsification.Let me expand this difference. The sword or dagger is a magical symbolof the logic of Science — it contrasts with the cup as a magical symbol of thefeeling of Magic. The former is about banishment and falsification, the latterabout acceptance and confirmation. So when, for example, I describe the late60s as a time of ‘Magical revival’ after the materialism of the 50s, you shouldadjust your vision of the 60s until you find a sense in which it did indeed feellike a Magical revival. Do not look for counter-arguments. Ignore for thetime being the equal truth that a whole wave of 60s consumer technology hadarrived — transistor radios, colour tvs etc — new technology which lay wayout of reach in the supposedly materialistic 50s. The point was that suchtechnology was now taken for granted, it did not excite us as Magic began to.Look instead at the fashionable interests — record covers covered with exotic -   Filesand the way that the media seemed to be encouraging unscientificthinking rather than working actively to guide public debate along morerational lines. In the same week the BBC radio programme The Moral Mazepicked up his theme. It was clear that the panel did not approve of what washappening. They too seemed perplexed that today’s society, with its educa-tion and ready accessibility of Scientific ideas and methods, should be sosusceptible to such unscientific ‘delusions’.When I heard Dawkins addressing the popularity of New Age ideas atthe Cheltenham Literary Festival, what struck me was the strength of hisfeelings on the subject. There seemed to be something stronger than reasondriving his distaste for the rise of New Age pseudo science. I concluded that,in the terms of my recent volume of essays — What I Did In My Holidays —Dawkins had evoked a demon. Like myself, he is a champion of the notionthat ideas can replicate and evolve within the ecology of human culture in amanner akin to the Darwinian model. The demon he had evoked was theapparent fear that New Age ideas might now be proving fitter to survive thanhis own ideas. Having demoted ‘goodness’ or ‘godliness’ and replaced it with‘fitness’ as the key determinant, he has to face the possibility that Science’s‘Truth’ might not be enough to save it from extinction. He can thus appearas a tribal shaman dancing a devil dance to protect his mind-children from astronger foe.But even without accepting Dawkins’ and my beliefs about the evolutionof ideas, some people still seem disturbed that a rational culture could returnto Magical modes of thinking. As the original edition of this book pointedout in the early 1970s, however, this is not only ok, it is perfectly normal.Magic does not precede Science — it generally follows after it.I first became aware of this in my own life, having evolved from pre-teenpiety, through teenage skepticism to an interest in the occult at university. Farfrom experiencing these occult studies as a degeneration of my Scientificeducation, a backwards slide into atavism, they seemed like an expansion ofmy mental horizons, as growth beyond the skeptical Scientism of my teens.Nor did it begin with a withering of skepticism; on the contrary, that skepti-cism increased to the point where it turned upon the principles of Scienceitself: I witnessed Science itself failing to meet the standards of proof thatwere demanded of parascience.So was this progression from Science towards Magic simply my personalaberration? No, because I had witnessed a similar, slower change in societybetween the 1950s and 60s: a change from a culture that was excited byScience towards one that was more excited by Magic. Again, Magic follow-ing upon Science and not vice versa.

But I argue that this cycle does not stop at adolescence. I recallhow my own observation grew so strong that I began to notice the flaws inScientific thought and the areas of life it could not explain away: so I inclinedtoward Magical thinking as a student, at the age when so many of us becomeinterested in the occult. During the early 20s we once more act out myths— the Young Man with Sports Car, the Newlyweds, etc. — until the ‘saturnreturn’ and the approaching age of 30 makes us once more seriously questionour real purpose in life.The cycle probably moves on — but becomes less obvious as we eachdevelop our own nature and maybe discover a personal bias towards a partic-ular direction of thought.A CYCLE OF FASHIONConsider the sixties occult revival; did it not last for about one generation? I do not mean that Magic has since been abandoned. Just as we did notabandon technology in the sixties — in fact we had more of it than ever butbegan to take it for granted — so also there are still more New Age shops andbooks on Magic available now than there ever were in the sixties and yet wetake them for granted. The movement I am trying to isolate is this: betweenthe early sixties and late seventies the public got its kicks from occultism;sensational coverage of parascience, lurid exposes of witches, books on blackmagic and record covers littered with occult symbolism. For a period of aboutone generation, Magic had real novelty value and a feeling of real powerpotential — something it no longer has to any extent.But if we go back to the end of the nineteenth century we see a similarmovement. Theater posters of that era are so rich in occult symbolism (bowlsof incense, Egyptian hieroglyphs etc.) that this ‘art nouveau’ style was actu-ally one of the main sources of inspiration for sixties psychedelia. The turn ofthe twentieth century was when the Golden Dawn occult society attractedpublic attention and so many similar orders briefly flourished.Why this flirtation with the occult? In the late Victorian era of a gener-ation earlier, the theater posters reveal a craze for public scientific demon-strations — theaters putting on shows about the wonders of electricity. Itsuggests that the Edwardian occult revival could have been a reaction againstlate Victorian materialism; just as the hippy generation reacted against 50smaterialism. Magic following upon Science in the public imagination.According to my cycle, however, there should have been a Religiousphase before the Scientific one. This was very apparent in Victorian times —the Scientific craze referred to the discoveries of Charles Darwin and otherfashionable ideas which seemed to knock Religion on the head. But what -   magical imagery which was a direct reference to the earlier magical revival atthe beginning of the century.Try to see the truth in what I am saying rather than to test it for falsifi-ability — that is the correct approach to a Magical theory. While Scientistscompete to disprove or reject ideas, Magicians compete to accept them. Thisapproach worries rationalists who fear that such a gullible attitude must leaddown a slippery slope into delusion. The Magical method is to act ‘as if ’ atheory is correct until it has done its job, and only then to replace it withanother theory. A theory only fails if it cannot take hold in the mind andallow one to act ‘as if ’. As long as this approach is carried out properly —with a Magician’s understanding that the theory is being accepted onlybecause it is ‘working’, not because it is ‘true’ — then there is little danger ofdelusion.Where there is danger, it stems from lack of Magical understanding. Ourempirical Scientific education inclines us to believe that if a theory is work-ing then it is more likely to be ‘true’ — and such belief can indeed be danger-ous.This is another reason why I consider it important to re-issue this book:the real danger lies not so much in Magic as in people’s misunderstanding,misapplication and denial of it.A PERSONAL CYCLEThe extent to which a new-born babe is a blank slate or not is open to debate,nevertheless it is clear that its mind has had little time to build up innerresources of memory and prejudice. Compared with an older child, therefore,the baby is very much an observer, rather than intuitive. And it processes itsobservations by feeling rather than logic (‘big soft pink things are to besucked’).So we begin our lives as ‘Magical’ thinkers. By early childhood we havebuilt up an inner world of memories which begins to overwhelm observationand shift the emphasis toward intuition, but we still have not mastered reallogic. So we evolve into ‘Artistic’ thinking: a golden age when we live outmyths of fairies and dragons and can believe in them when we want to: Thearmchair isa space ship when we play with it.Around the pre-teen age this growing intuitive sense has overwhelmedfeeling and the reasoning power is now in the ascendent. Still living off ourrich inner worlds, we begin to wonder why things are as they are. This ratherserious-minded phase of ‘Religious’ thinking lasts until the teenage yearswhen logic grows to dominate intuition, and a growing awareness of theoutside world moves us into ‘Scientific’ skepticism: ‘just give me one goodreasonwhy I can’t stay out all night,’ demands the teenager. -     - "},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"novelty value in millennial Religion — plus its attendant tribalism andnationalism — and it is soon going to rediscover the wonders of Science aswe enter a new materialistic post-millennium phase.He is, however, reacting to something more profound than a public crazecycle.

According to S Bochner’sTheRole of Mathematics in the Rise of Science“Purely Mathematically, there isnothing in Newton’s Principia that was not familiar to Archimedes, exceptthe notion of the rate of change of a velocity”. This is quoted in Jack Linsay’sThe Origins of Alchemy In Graeco-Roman Egyptin which book it is pointedout that Arabic metallurgy did not evolve out of mystical alchemy, but ratherthe reverse. As in China, the original objective was to imitate gold by chem-ical means, not to create it — aurifiction not aurifaction.So the Dark Ages strike me as a time when the rationalist ‘Science’ of themetallurgists became overlaid with Magical thinking, and neoplatonism tookover from the rationalist philosophy of Archimedes and Aristotle. This wasfollowed after about five centuries by a movement more akin to my Artisticthought in an age typified by the troubadours, courtly love and the setting offairy tales and legends. In the mediaeval period this gave way to Religiousthought, which dominated society until around 1500 and the rise ofScientific thought typified by the Enlightenment and reaching its apogee inVictorian times.In these terms we are now at the end of this era and once more Magicalthought is on the ascendent, in the sense that it is beginning to take an intel-lectual lead in our society — whatever passing phases of fashion might seemto overlay the process as described in the previous novelty cycle.What is the evidence for a rebirth of Magical thought? This has beendiscussed at length in my other writings, so I will just list a few examples.First is the fact that rationalists are feeling very defensive — when youmight expect them to be rejoicing in their triumph over the superstition ofthe past.Secondly, people are increasingly confusing statistical correlation withScientific proof. If, for example, some respected medical research institutewere to announce a highly significant correlation between coffee and cancer, -   about the period before the late 40s and 50s materialism? Was the publicparticularly taken up with Religious thinking? If we admit Fascism andCommunism as examples of Religious thought — as I suggest in Chapter10A — the answer is clearly affirmative.And before the Thirties there should have been an Artistic craze phase.This is typified by the Roaring Twenties, which saw the popularisation of somany modern art movements, an obsession with ‘style’, dancing and jazz, anda spate of publicity stunts like long-distance flying records, dancingmarathons etc. In this period crude new technologies like radio and cine-matography evolved into art forms.So the cycle I am sensing runs like this. Towards the beginning of theNineteenth century there was a craze for spiritualism and mesmerism — aMagical phase. This was followed by an Artistic phase typified by my localtown Cheltenham Spa — an elegant town built in a speculative boom forstylish living and health fads. A phase very reminiscent of the 1980s yuppyera and one which similarly ended with a market collapse and Religiousrevival. People in the mid Victorian period had burned their fingers andreturned to church for a while until the Science craze caught on. Then camethe previously mentioned Edwardian Magical revival, the Artistic frenzy ofthe 20s and another market collapse which lead to a search for identity in thetwentieth century ‘Religions’ of politics. Fifties materialism was followed bya sixties Magical revival and another Artistic phase in the 80s. This time thenew technologies which matured into Art were computer games and graph-ics. As in the 20s the emphasis was on style, music, and record breakingstunts as well as heady speculation. The 80s stock market crash again pavedthe way for a sense of seriousness and a new Religious spirit which I detectin the 90s — this time a mixture of pre-millennial religious interest plus arevival of nationalism and football tribalism. Religion has as much shockvalue in the 90s as Magic had in the late 60s.So, according to my model, the next generation after the millennium willbecome once more intoxicated with the wonders of Science. Stuff which isbeing talked about nowadays but which is really pretty limited and clumsy —like virtual reality, cloning and fractal digital cinematography — these thingswill really begin to deliver in a few years time. As in the 50s when we becamefascinated with the novelty value of Science, we will again begin to believethat Science has an answer for everything — and that will continue untilsomewhere around 2020 when we will be due for a reaction and anotherMagical revival. I will then become famous — and too old or dead to care!A CYCLE OF THOUGHTAccording to the last cycle, Richard Dawkins has nothing to fear, because thepublic isn’t really obsessed with Magic, it is rather more taken with the -     - \u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0002\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0002\u0003\u0004\u0005\u0005\u0006\u0007\b\t\u0004\u0002\u0004\u000b\u0002\f\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u0002\u0010\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u0002\u0013\u0002\u0014\u0015\u0006\u0002\u0016\u0017\u0004\b\u0006\u000e\t\u0007\u0002\u0018\t\u0019\u000e\r\u000e\u001a\u0002\u0013\u0002\u001b\u001b\u001b\u001c\u0017\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u001d\u001e\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u001c\u0007\u0004\u001e\u0002"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"Sixthly, some new technologies confound mechanistic analysis.Observation and logic are fundamental to Scientific thinking — if you left anintelligent person alone on a desert island with a clock or steam engine anda few spanners they could eventually discover how it worked, but the same isnot true of a silicon chip. Whereas a previous generation felt it necessary tobe able to understand how domestic appliances worked, and how to repairthem, we increasingly are driven to accept that things either work or theyneed to be replaced. Learning to accept unexplained phenomena in this wayis good training for Magical thinking. Here is an example: as a Fortranprogrammer in the 1970s, if a program did not work I would return to thesource code and analyse it for errors. In the 1990s this is no longer practical— instead I phone a ‘help’ line and am told there is a ‘bug’ which means Ishould try to avoid certain sequences of activity. This is analogous to beingtold that it is unlucky to walk under ladders. There are two factors here driv-ing the evolution towards Magical thinking: increasing complexity as in thesecond example, plus commercial pressure which forbids access to the sourcecode, as in the third example.Seventhly, increasing commercial involvement with pure Science will,according to Magical theory, make it less pure and more Magical. An exam-ple: on yesterday’s radio discussion I heard a fairly belligerent speaker insistthat there was absolutely no evidence that psychological analysis had everhelped cure depression. “That’s odd” I thought, “I can immediately think ofsomeone I know who has been helped in this way, and that invalidates thatassertion”. As if he had read my mind the speaker promptly added “...ofcourse you must not be taken in by anecdotal evidence, I’m talking abouthard scientific data”. What struck me as curious was this: he was dismissingthe evidence of mine own experience, whereas I was more inclined to dismissthe ‘hard data’ as being less valuable than anecdotal data. Why was this? Onreflection I realised that I gave less value to the Scientific research because itwas very likely to have been conducted with intent to prove something,whereas mine own observation was nothing more than pure observation.According to Magical theory, the outcome of an act will be influenced by theintent of the actor, so any Scientific experiment or measurement carried outwith a desire to prove something will be affected by that desire (Scientists,understandably, would question this assertion). However, increasingcommercial funding of universities and research inevitably invokes strongerintent — researchers need to ensure continued funding to support them.According to this theory, the purest Science was that pursued by gentlemenof leisure in the past, or incumbents of wealthy old universities or bloatedgovernment bodies who could afford the luxury of pure Scientific explorationwithout any ‘lust for result’. Such conditions are now being eroded — evenOxbridge needs to woo industry, and government itself is trying hard to shed -   there would be a public outcry for the banning of coffee — because peoplewould feel that it had been ‘Scientifically proven’ that this would save lives.In my terms, this would be sympathetic Magical thinking — cancer ‘goeswith’ coffee and so you banish the latter to banish the former — and it wouldnot be Science until a causal link had been identified. This is an examplewhere Magic takes over from Science because Science, through technology,increases change to the point where change happens too fast to be managedby the slow processes of Science.Thirdly, Science is becoming so complex that communication couldbreak down. Jack Lindsay’s book suggests that one factor in changing Arabicmetallurgy into mystical alchemy was politically enforced secrecy.Communication of a common body of belief is vital to Science. If you restrictit, Science grows cranky and loses its universality. When I wrote the firstedition of this book I saw this happening, and the driving factor was the ColdWar. We were hearing of mysterious psychic experiments from behind theIron Curtain, every bit as weird as some of the Science that went on secretlyunder the Nazi regime. The situation is now different: we do not have somuch military restriction on Science, but there are increasing commercialreasons for secrecy, plus the sheer difficulty of communicating such a vastamount of research. To see what happens when Scientists stop communicat-ing, consider cold fusion: when this was openly debated across the globe aconsensus was rapidly reached that it was not repeatable. But now the subjecthas become taboo, several isolated laboratories around the world are achiev-ing significant results which would have been dismissed as Magic if they hadbeen reported. I believe that, if you isolate a group of Scientists, they evolveaway from Scientific consensus and this is a threat which could subvertScience itself.Fourthly, because it has become traditional to dismiss the reality ofMagic, it then means that people can freely practice Magic without admit-ting it. As in my example in the introduction of the marketing companywhich is ‘really’ just invoking the assistance of the god Mercury. If you toldthem they were practicing Magic they would say “nonsense, this is scientificmarketing because it really works and we can prove it” — a definition of‘scientific’ which would embrace chanting to make the Sun rise. There aremany such examples of Magical practices being accepted loosely under thebanner of Science.Fifthly, Magic can take over when Science loses touch with human need.As in my discussion of alternative medicine in another chapter, any attemptto test remedies by eliminating the role of the placebo effect is as divorcedfrom the human condition as an automobile test conducted with no fuel inthe tank in order to ‘eliminate extraneous factors’. -     - "},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"recently been wary of accusations that they are undermining Religiousauthority or acting against divine will. The dominant Artistic heritage of theage has been Religious, traditional Magical texts are heavily overlaid withReligious imagery and language, and the majority of wars have been foughton Religious/political grounds.Compare that spirit with the previous, classical era when the mostfamous (Trojan) war was fought over a beautiful woman! Replace the domi-nance of Religion with a dominance of Art and culture and you get muchmore the feeling of the previous age of Aries (there is even a sense that anearlier pre-classical era was dominated by nations with the most powerfulMagic).In this cycle, then, the new age of Aquarius will be dominated by theScientific spirit. Guernica was perhaps a turning point — a battle foughtostensibly on idealistic grounds but actually so the Germans could test theirbombs. Tomorrow’s wars will be an excuse to try out military hardware tojustify the billions of public money spent upon it. So no matter how Arty,Magical or Religious we are being, it will all tend to be done in the name ofScience.As I suggested in the first edition of this book, we won’t hear so muchabout ‘a return to Magical thinking’ as about ‘the birth of the soft Sciences’,of ‘a new holistic Science’, ‘feminine Science’ and so on (and since thatedition some of these phrases have actually been used). As in my introduc-tory example of the marketing agency, people will insist that they are beingvery Scientific even when blatantly practicing Magic. The whole New Agephenomenon reflects this contradiction between the two cycles — peopleopting for phrases like ‘quantum consciousness’ and shying away from themore concise traditional Magical terminology.Let us return to an early example from this chapter, the talk by RichardDawkins at the 1998 Cheltenham Festival. He was announcing a new bookcalled Unweaving the Rainbowwhich took its title from a conversationbetween some romantic poets who cursed Newton for having destroyed thebeauty of the rainbow through his explanation of the properties of light.Dawkins felt sad, yet sympathetic to this attitude, and he set out to redressthe balance by showing the many ways in which Science can invoke wonder-ment, awe and aesthetic pleasure. The result was a wonderful presentationby a man appointed to be a public spokesman for Science — but was itScientific?I would say that the task Dawkins had set himself was this: to change thepublic perception of Science. ‘Changing perceptions’, however is not aScientific but a Magical process in my usage. In a world defined in terms oftruth and falsehood, Science may set out to clarifyperceptions, but not tochangethem. A more truly Scientific response to those romantic poets would -   pounds. The long term effect will be to split the consensus of Scientificworld-view into rival channels, as has happened with television. FutureScientists will need to choose, for example, whether they accept Scientifictruth as defined by Microsoft, or Friends of the Earth, or the nuclear indus-try, or the French government, or whatever. It will still be called “Science”,but it will amount to a choice of belief systems, which is pure Magic.AN EVEN SLOWER CYCLEThat last cycle amounted to a confirmation of Dawkins’ and other rational-ists’ worst fears — that society is currently moving away from the authorityof Scientific thought and is giving increasing credence and authority toMagical thinking; and that the precedent for this change was the coming ofthe Dark Ages.The very phrase ‘Dark Ages’ is enough to send a shiver down rationalistspines, with its sense of a denial of all that enlightenment stands for. But Iwill now explain why it should be very different this time round, and whytoday’s rationalists will never be quite sure whether they are winning or losingthe battle for our minds!I began by describing a personal cycle I had noticed in mine own educa-tion, and then a slower cycle of public crazes. I do not see any link betweenthese two cycles — they are operating at quite different levels and in differ-ent contexts. In my case they came together at one point rather nicely,because I was personally getting into Magic at university in the late sixties atthe same time as it was catching on as a public craze — and that gave me alovely feeling of being at the leading edge of contemporary ideas. After awhile, however, my personal cycle got out of step and I became disillusionedwith that Magical revival.Next I described another independent cycle, a much slower one, which isconcerned with intellectual authority. In this cycle we are at the end of fivecenturies in which Scientific thought has lead the way, and I suggest thatMagical thought is now taking the lead. This cycle will take about two thou-sand years to repeat.Now a period of ‘two thousand years’ brings to mind another Magicaltheory — that of the astrological aeons. In this theory we are entering theAge of Aquarius after two thousand years of the Age of Pisces and, beforethat, two thousand years of the Age of Aries.There is no reason why this cycle has to match up to my scheme, but alink does suggest itself, because the last two thousand years have, on anotherlevel, been dominated by Religion — whatever the current intellectual driv-ing force has been. Throughout the Age of Pisces the dominant spirit hasbeen Religious — whether the activity was Magic, Science, Art or Religion,the tendency has been to justify it ‘in God’s name’.

It was as if they had done so many inner child workshops andtarot readings that they yearned for something bigger than their own over-explored psyches. They began to look outward and wanted to be part of oraligned with something bigger, a truth which lay ‘out there’ — and that wasa driver towards a revival of Religious thinking. It manifests itself as a searchfor some absolute standard, some higher power, or a nation or at least a teamor tribal affiliation which is hoped to be greater than the sum of its parts.Even the current fascination with the paranormal and ufos has more to dowith a Religious quest than Magical practice.Why should we next turn back to Science? I anticipate it will be becausemillennial fever will have abated and technology will begin to deliver someof the miracles of information technology and genetic engineering now beingpromised.Another possibility is to look for some astrological correlate, thoughthere is no reason why it should exist. The nearest I can see is that Neptunein air signs go with Science as fashion — maybe through idealising reason;Neptune in water idealises feeling and Magic; Neptune in fire idealisescreativity so Art is fashion; while Neptune in earth does not so much idealisematter as erode materialism and initiate a search for new boundaries innationalism, tribalism and Religion.That fashion cycle is a fairly superficial cycle, and it hardly justifies amajor shift in humanity’s ideas. Looking at the bigger picture I can see howthe tendency of Religion is to evolve towards monotheism. This leads to acrisis, because a monotheistic Religion eventually comes up against the mate-rial world. The physical world can happily coexist with a pantheon of naturespirits, but how can it be allowed to exist when there is only one reality —and that is God? Ultimately this can be resolved by making the materialuniverse itself into God — ie by concluding that matter is the only reality,and that the proper study of it is Science. Thus Religion will inevitably giveway to Science. Another theory is that a Religious society, with its strongtraditions, tends to be a stable society — and stability is a condition suitablefor the spread of knowledge and therefore a fertile basis for the rise ofScience.Science, on the other hand, encourages change. It leads to new technolo-gies and these impose accelerating change on society. The problem here isthat Scientific thought is too slow to cope with the speed of change whicharises — people begin to need immediate solutions as in my example ofbanning some new chemical or process because it correlates statistically withcancer. People need recourse to Magic to cope with the changes brought -   be to admit that a certain sense of awe might have been destroyed by theNewtonian analysis of the rainbow, but to insist that the awe was a primitiveemotional reaction and, in its place, we now had a superior understandingwhich was worth far more because Truth has its own higher Beauty... orsomething along those lines.I enjoyed Dawkins’ talk because I felt he was attempting a Magical trans-formation of Science into something more acceptable to changing tastes. Itwas quite good Magic, and yet it would not now be admitted as such, for hisofficial role is something to do with educating the public about Science.My role is to educate the public about Magic, but it will probably not beofficially recognised in the Age of Aquarius when I would do better to inventsnappy New Age pseudo-scientific terminology for my thesis rather thanpresent it in traditional magical terminology!WHY THESE CYCLES?Remember, this is an example of a Magical theory. It relies upon verificationand not falsification. When I describe the two thousand years before Christas being dominated by the Artistic spirit, the clever reader is not the one wholooks for counter-evidence, but the one who can sense the truth in that state-ment. In this way the reader gives value to the theory and this allows it tobecome powerful and useful — with predictive and explanatory ability. Thetrick then is not to forget that it is just a Magical theory — even if it seemsto explain everything, you should resist the Religious or Scientific temptationto equate it with ‘truth’.As a Magical theory it does not need to have a single cause or reasonbehind it — a cycle is just a cycle. But it is naturally human to look for someunderlying cause.In the case of the novelty cycle, I recall a feeling in the early sixties that‘there must be something more’ than the materialism if the fifties. Rationalistexplanations for everything from falling in love to the Religious instinct wereno longer liberating us from dogmatic Religious traditions, instead theybegan to sound just as ‘smart ass’ and smug as the old Religious tenets. Onthe other hand, Magic was such an outdated idea that it had revolutionaryappeal. Turning to Magic had the feeling of a ‘turning inward’, away from thecrass surface qualities of materialism to find something ‘deeper’ within.This turning away from materialism was not a physical act. On thecontrary, people bought more radios, televisions, cars and gadgets than everbefore — maybe that was why these marvels of technology lost their noveltyappeal and became essentials rather than luxuries.Similarly, in the eighties, people did not abandon the tarot cards, astro-logical readings and amulets of the Magical revival. On the contrary, books -     - "},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"On the other hand, when a situation is dominated by feeling it is asuseless to try to resolve it with facts as it is to use logic — because the onlyfaculty stronger than feeling is intuition. Going back to our millennial cult— many such cults begin with a group of high-minded people with strongfeelings for what is decent and good and looking for ways to help the world.Then one charismatic leader has an intuitive flash or message from god, andit is accepted by the members even when it leads them away from their orig-inal principles towards paranoia and cruelty. The leader’s intuition eventuallyoverwhelms those finer sensibilities because intuition is the only facultystronger than feeling.So I have suggested that maybe the cycle of thought has its roots in acircular hierarchy of our mental faculties. One cycle driving another — somany Magical theories are cyclical. Maybe our species has evolved in this waybecause such an arrangement fosters continuous change and, being circular,endless change. Because humanity cannot sit still, it has to grow.Or maybe I have simply projected my own inner experience onto history!THE LEGACY OF CYCLESA curious by-product of these cycles is that each way of thinking tends toinherit a burden from its predecessor. This burden is more or less unconsciousand tends to muddy the waters of my comparatively neat model.Consider Science, for example. According to my definition it should besecurely founded on reason and observation with no need for dogmatism.Indeed, this objective, open-mindedness would be strongly claimed byScientists themselves. However, Scientific thinkers are all too often highlydogmatic, especially when debating spiritual topics when phrases like‘mumbo jumbo’ and ‘New Age nonsense’ spring almost automatically fromtheir lips. This unconscious dogmatism is Science’s legacy from Religiousthought: in the Religion sector faith is a virtue to which one aspires, in theScience sector it has become an unconscious habit one seeks to transcend.Magic, in turn, inherits unconscious skepticism from Science. Just as the‘open minded’ Scientist is deep down a total believer in material reality, soalso the ‘gullible’ Magician deep down does not really believe in anything.When astrologers, for example, get together one of the commonest conver-sational gambits is “last week I had Saturn pass over my Mercury and — it’sabsolutely incredible — my car broke down three days running!”. Ritualmagicians can be heard saying “we did this healing rite and — it’s absolutelyincredible — next time he went to the doctor there was no sign of thetumour”. Can you imagine a group of chemists getting together and saying“I put this litmus paper into the acid and — it’s absolutely incredible — itchanged colour”? -   about by Science. What is more, the expansion of Science becomes so rapidthat the subject begins to fragment — and this goes against the need for freecommunication of concepts. Once Science fragments into discrete groupswho no longer share information, as it did at the end of the classical era, thenit grows cranky and... er, interesting. So Science will eventually give way toMagic.Magic begins with the desire to control a turbulent world but, as anyonewho has studied it eventually discovers, it evolves towards transformation ofexperience. Instead of trying to control the world’s finances, experiencedMagicians usually put more effort into transcending them. Magical groupsend up doing more rituals to celebrate Nature than to control Her. ThusMagic tends to evolve into Art, ritual into drama.Art, in turn, seems to evolve from popular tribal celebration towards amore exclusive and individual voyage of discovery — and that sets the scenefor a personal Religious experience or conversion, and the cycle begins again.It is as if the four faculties I introduced — logic, observation, feeling andintuition — co-existed in a cyclic hierarchy like the childrens’ game of ‘paper,scissors, stone’ where scissors cut paper, stone sharpens scissors and paperwraps stone.First imagine a situation dominated by intuition — for example a millen-nial cult where everyone is in thrall of the preachings channelled by the cultleader. What is the one person who cannot be tolerated in such a cult? It isthe rational enquirer who gently points out that — however convincing theleader’s arguments for the end of the world — he is not the first person whohas made a similar case and been proven wrong. Such a person cannot betolerated because logic is the one faculty stronger than intuition.Now imagine a situation dominated by logic — maybe an academic thinktank addressing economic problems. Fact is the nemesis of such a mindset —however brilliant and flawless the logical arguments put forward, they will bedefeated by events which contradict their predictions because observation isthe only faculty stronger than logic. If you are in a situation dominated bysomeone who can always win verbal arguments, then it is no good appealingto feeling judgements or an intuitive sense that he is wrong. Instead you mustsay “that is very interesting, so you should be able to produce some real-worldfigures to back up your case and even make some verifiable predictions fortomorrow’s results. Can you?”.I was once explaining this dominance of observation over logic to some-one and they squashed my argument by saying “yes, but there are good statis-tics and bad statistics, of course.” The reason I was squashed was that, byascribing the words ‘good’ and ‘bad’ to what should be objective results, mycompanion had demonstrated the next relationship — that the only facultystronger than observation is feeling. -     - \u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0002\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0002\u0003\u0004\u0005\u0005\u0006\u0007\b\t\u0004\u0002\u0004\u000b\u0002\f\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u0002\u0010\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u0002\u0013\u0002\u0014\u0015\u0006\u0002\u0016\u0017\u0004\b\u0006\u000e\t\u0007\u0002\u0018\t\u0019\u000e\r\u000e\u001a\u0002\u0013\u0002\u001b\u001b\u001b\u001c\u0017\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u001d\u001e\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u001c\u0007\u0004\u001e\u0002"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"the Magic sector meaning is a precious thing, a pointer towards wholeness,while in the Art sector meaning has become a tangle of associations that oneseeks to cut away to reveal life in its pure essence.I am equally unqualified to judge what is the unconscious burdenReligion inherits from Art, but my guess is that it is glamour. The Southernbaptist turns scornfully away from the theater of popish robes and smells,only to create their own rock ‘n roll glamour in turn. Even the most extremepuritanism of the Shakers comes across to us as ‘high style’.COMPASS, NOT CLASSIFICATIONI insist that the four-fold diagram is a compass of directions and not a definerof categories, and yet I use the terms Magic, Science, Art and Religion as ifthey were four distinct disciplines.Sorry.It’s the easy way to write — just like it’s easy to say I live “in the SouthWest”. But I am allowed to talk about The South etc, because people under-stand my double use of the word as a direction and a temporary definition ofplace.Here the usage is less familiar, so I decide to explain once again thatMagical theories tend to be infinitely translatable in the way a compass is.The same compass can be used to divide the globe into four cultures, Britaininto four regions, Gloucester into four quarters or a house into four wings.So also the thought-compass of this book can be focussed down to analyseever narrower activities.If I take advertising as an example of human activity, it should be nosurprise to learn that, from where I stand, I consider it to be a form of Magic.Other people consider it to be art or science, maybe. But the fact that Iconsider it to be Magic does not force me to deny that advertising can dressitself in the imagery of Art, Science or Religion. It less often uses Magicalimagery except for specific niche markets, or at times like the sixties andseventies when Magic was fashion — why is this? I guess that advertisingcreatives would describe Magical imagery as ‘too cheesy’ and, if so, I wouldask them to qualify the ‘too’. Because I suspect that the people who would beembarrassed would not be the public but rather the advertising industryitself. It shies away from Magical imagery because it would rather not facethe possibility that it is a branch of Magic!Anyway, let us apply the compass within advertising and recognise that ithas its ‘Scientific’ quarter — a tradition for presenting the technical benefitsof certain sorts of products. So here are four off-the-cuff fictitious advertis-ing slogans for toothpaste.Dukesodent — a better toothpaste. Your money back if you don’t agree. -   As I explained in my second volume of essays — Blast Your Way ToMegabuck$ With My SECRET Sex-Power Formula — what so many un-evolved Magical thinkers are trying to do is to convince themselves of thereality of a Magic which, deep down, they do not believe can really exist. Inthe Science sector an open, skeptical mind is a virtue that one aspires to, inthe Magic sector it is an inner emptiness one seeks to fill with meaning.Insofar as practical Magic demands an ability to switch beliefs at will, anunderlying skepticism is not a bad thing. But it can be just as corrosive as theScientist’s dogmatism, and it really shows when Scientists and Magicians getinto argument. Typically the Scientist is the first to succumb: as soon as theconversation moves to ‘other realities’ the Scientist is liable to smell a subver-sive Magical rat and lapse into mindless phrases like “utter poppycock”. Atthis stage the Magicians usually have the intellectual high ground as they aretypically out-Sciencing the Scientist by asking whether the evidence has beenconsidered and so on. However they all too often lose this advantage andthemselves lapse into haranguing the Scientist whose scornful dogmatismechoes their own hidden fear that Magic is indeed a load of deluded crap! Ofcourse, both sides would reject my explanation totally and insist that theirarguments were based entirely on fact.I’m not so sure about the burden that Art inherits from Magic, butsuspect that it could be a sense of ‘meaning’. It always struck me as a bit oddhow people can be irritated by modern art because they do not ‘understandit’, and how they can feel much happier when offered some bogus ‘explana-tion’ — eg “Mondrian’s paintings are made up of a grid of straight black linessymbolising the order and rules of modern civilisation, dividing areas ofbright colour which represent the human passions being restrained by theserules”. I used to think that the demand for explanation was a product of ourScientific culture, but maybe it is a legacy from Magic. A poet once told methat it was wrong to think of a symbol as a sort of telephone number connect-ing one to an idea, and I was surprised because that is exactly what it is inMagical usage. There is, for example, a sort of tick symbol extant in ourculture which is used to call up Nike, the goddess of victory — you see adver-tisements with sweaty athletes and some slogan like ‘make history or be it’and this little tick inserted as the one element to give the arbitrary picturesome meaning. Surely that is Magic, not Art.A Magical image — like an alchemical illustration or a tarot card — is apicture where every element is deliberately built into the picture for itssymbolic associations. I am sure that most Artists would scorn such anapproach: indeed those, like Salvador Dali, who approximate to it receivelittle critical acclaim for such imagery. True Art, we are told, needs no suchartificial crutches, and yet how many Artists can claim never to have feltcomforted or even justified by those who read ‘meaning’ into their work?

To disturb or offend, ask such Magicalquestions as “does Israeli military success in the Middle East signify thatJehovah is a more credible deity than Allah?” To stimulate debate apply thelogic and observation of Science and ask “if you really want to spread yourmessage, shouldn’t you be preaching via the mass media rather than in coldchurches?”To irritate the Artist ask the Magical question “what does this picturemean?”.

I looked at the feeling among some rationalists that we are slippingback into atavistic, superstitious thought patterns, and suggested that thiscould not be possible unless such ways of thinking offered some advantageover rationalism.Exploring my own development I discerned a cycle in which Science didindeed pave the way to Magic, and it was indeed an advance in my thinking.Seen in terms of this cycle, the immediate media frenzy is not so much aboutMagic as Religion — today’s trendy truth lies ‘out there’ rather than ‘within’— and Science is poised to make a big comeback.On a more serious level, however, Scientific rationalism is eroding onmany fronts and we are indeed entering the equivalent of a ‘dark ages’, but Ido not believe it will be quite so dark as the last one because Scientific prin- -   Dukesodent — the only toothpaste endorsed by the British DentalAssociation.Dukesodent — the only toothpaste featuring ionisation-enhancing free radi-cal plaque inhibition agents.Dukesodent — the hi-tech toothpaste for the hi-tech generation.All four slogans lean towards the Science side of advertising, in my terms,and yet I can still draw a distinction between them with my four directions.Only the first is specifically Scientific in my terms, because it appealsprimarily to observation (try it yourself ) and logic (they couldn’t offer moneyback unless it was reasonably good).The second has every bit as much logical appeal — it must be pretty goodfor BDA approval. But it makes little appeal to observation, because only asmall minority of people have enough direct experience to know about theBDA and its mechanisms for product endorsement, and the advertisement isnot directed towards that niche. For the general public the value of BDAapproval is based primarily upon intuitive acceptance of their priestly author-ity in dental matters — a Religious appeal.Compare the third, the one with the most blatant Scientific imagery.Again, for a small niche market of dental technicians this could (if the wordsmade sense) have genuine Scientific appeal, but for the general public it ispure Magic — touching lightly on personal experience of plaque and helpfulScientific additives, but relying far more on good feelings for impressivewords than any logical or causal understanding.The fourth is purely a style statement — Art in my terms.Thus demonstrating, I trust, that this theory is not a statement aboutabsolute categories but simply an indicator of relative positioning. Eachquadrant contains all four directions — just as every astrological signcontains the entire zodiac, and every sphere of the Cabalistic tree of lifecontains the whole tree.PLAYING THE COMPASSIt strikes me that you could play with this cycle as a conversational gambit inthe presence of anyone who is strongly polarised towards one of my fourdirections of thought.This is how you do it. If you want to irritate the speaker, question hisideas from the perspective of the previous quadrant. To offend or disturb, usethe opposite quadrant.

However,experience suggests that some readers will feel that I have evaded thereal subject by omitting to mention screaming virgins, sacrificed goatsand chalices of warm blood.Though I would be the last to deny the Magical importance ofsuch things, yet I insist that their importance is more peripheral thanbasic. For all the books on Magic which provide lurid details ofbloody sabbats, there are many of the more practical step-by-stepintroductions which go no further than accounts of breathing exer-cises and meditations. And yet both types of book are about Magic.Books with titles like ‘Sex Secrets of the Black MagiciansExposed’ are the equivalent in scope to books with titles like ‘TheWonderland of Science’. The image of the black robed Magician isno more and no less essential than the image of the Scientist in awhite lab coat. If one’s only experience of Science was through thechildren’s books with pictures of cyclotrons, radio telescopes andlasers, then a basic chemistry course at high school would seem aterrible let-down. It would be hard to believe that it had anything todo with Science as one had learnt to understand the word. Those‘boring’ meditation books are just the equivalent of a Teach YourselfChemistry text.When you consider that the transition from basic physics tocyclotrons extends over many years of study via high school, univer-sity and research degrees, then it will seem less than reasonable toexpect any one book to bridge satisfactorily the gap between thinkingabout thinking and screaming virgins, least of all in a short essay suchas this. All that can be done is to explain why I consider that theimportance of sacrificed goats has been exaggerated.Without going into great details as to what I ‘really believe’, it can beargued that, in some sense at least, the Devil was a creation of theChurch. Firstly, as one Religion replaces another, it is desirable to -     - ciples have now got too strong a hold. Everything, however irrational, willbe done ‘in the name of Science’ and the ideas in this book will be largelyignored until someone has the wit to re-phrase them in suitably pseudo-scientific New Age terminology.Finally, just in case the picture is getting too neat, I pointed out that inpractice each way of thought tends, in practice to carry a burden from itspredecessor in the cycle. In don’t think that bit will win many friends, but itcould help sort out a few bitter arguments.This cycle could also be divided into two phases, the Tragic and the Comic - in thegrandest sense of those words.Although I have described ‘intuition’ as the promtings from ‘within’ (in order tomake my thesis more digestible to rational minds), nevertheless it is often experiencedas messages from ‘beyond’.Thus the age of Tragedy is the passagefrom sensation towards intuition (viaMagic and Art). This is the timewhen humanity lifts its gaze fromthe mud towards the stars - theindividual discovers that he isat the mercy of divine powersand immutable laws. Whilethe age of Comedy is thereturn from intuition backto sensation (via Religionand Science), when cosmicprinciples tumble down andbecome enmeshed in themire of everyday reality.In the first case you haveGreek tragedy where commonhuman error leads to eternalpunishment, or the troubador whoelevates sexual attraction to unrequitedDivine Love. In the second case you haveShakespeare’s mighty rulers falling to humanerror, or Basil Fawlty tumbling from the heights of pretention to beating his motorvehicle in frustration.According to this chapter the great age of Comedy is finished and we are startinga new age of Tragedy. If I were to seek evidence of this it would be in such phrases as’Oedipus complex’ or ‘he cannot help it, it’s genetic’. For thus we are no longer mastersof our fate but its victims. Will has gone out of fashion (except among Thelemites) andthe only debate remaining is ‘nature versus nurture’.At the start of the 20th century a soldier who lost his nerve in battle would beshot. At the start of the 21st century he would be awarded compensation.>>TRAGIC>>>>COMIC>MSRAHEAVENEARTH"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"discussion was. Even in mediaeval texts, we find that the likelihoodof angels and demons being part of the man’s own mind was realisedand allowed for. What we do not find is the implicit Scientific deduc-tion that being part of our own minds means that they ‘don’t exist’.True, some ludicrous and superstitious theories of Magic will be met,particularly when forming part of Religious propaganda, but for thatmatter it is still possible in this age to find some very peculiar ideasbeing defended in an apparently Scientific manner.Remember, if your research into old texts uncovers only mumbo-jumbo, before dismissing it ask yourself: a) is the example totally freeof Religious propaganda influence? b) could it be an over-credulousinterpretation of what might have been a sensible earlier text? and c)does the example suffer from translation, or a shift with time in thesignificance of the words used? An old word meaning ‘breath’, forexample, is likely to have meant something experiential, yet morethan just a lungful of nitrogen and carbon dioxide.So where did the idea of an intelligent ‘gas’ from Venus arise?Certainly such ideas have developed in the same way as the Devildeveloped: they are usually used by the Scientific mind in an attemptto explain more clearly what it is that it does not believe in. Scientistsrejoiced in telling us that the sky was not a solid lid with heavenabove it, but who ever believed it was? You have to go an awful longway back to find intelligent discussion of such an idea — unless youare yourself gullible enough to mistake myths for the rational beliefsof the age. For that matter, even in this century children have beentold that stars are the holes in the floor of heaven.At a more subtle level, we find that the Scientist still creates animpossible view of Magic in order that he may reject it. He will quoteyesterday’s newspaper horoscope guide and announce that its errorsshow there to be ‘nothing in’ astrology. It does not seem to occur tohim that the announcement that “Gemini will receive importantnews this morning . .” is from a truly astrological viewpoint merelythe equivalent of the fashion prediction that “everybody will be wear-ing pastel colours this season.” Similarly, he will ask the advice of aconsultant astrologer, and when the astrologer asks: “Have you eversuffered any separation from your parents?”, the Scientist will answer:“I’m not going to tell you anything. Let’s see how good an astrologeryou really are.” Would the Scientist do the same to his doctor?

When Religiousthought holds authority, the reason and intuition of the Religiousleaders are all-powerful. So error and failure were rejected or deniedand, in analogy with the personal ‘shadow’ of the analytical psychol-ogists, such debris collected around the symbol of the Devil, havingnowhere else to go. The Devil was also very necessary to the feeblehuman who found the word of the Lord was insufficient to keep himmoving on the paths of righteousness, and who needed the hot breathof brimstone over his shoulder to drive him forward.Through accumulating all the rejections of authority, this symbolgained power in men’s minds and so unfortunately it gained fascina-tion. The symbol which started as a sort of rubbish dump had grownmore exciting and alluring than Christianity itself. The Devil wasindeed a Magical being. In opposition to the reason and intuition ofthe Religious leaders, the Devil was a creature of feeling and of obser-vation (in the sense that his world was the world of flesh and sensualexcitement).Just as a Religion-dominated society finds it necessary to create aworld of un-God, so it seems a Science-dominated society needs aworld of un-Truth in order to outline its ideals more clearly.When presenting to a Scientist arguments in favour of Magicalpractice in terms of the microcosm — ie the operator’s own mind, theretort is often on the lines of “Yes, but that’s very different fromsaying that some sort of gaseous intelligence or ‘spirit’ is going tocome wafting from the planet Venus in answer to your prayer.” Theidea seems to be that such ‘inner world’ arguments are all very cleverand ‘modern’, but they are far removed from ‘real’ magic, ie the delu-sions of past centuries when people were prepared to believe inanything.This is far from being the case. Anyone who studies early Magicaltexts — for example, those by Ficino or Agrippa — and who makesthe slightest effort to allow for the way that the use of words mighthave altered and evolved, can only be surprised at how sensible the -     - \u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0002\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0002\u0003\u0004\u0005\u0005\u0006\u0007\b\t\u0004\u0002\u0004\u000b\u0002\f\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u0002\u0010\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u0002\u0013\u0002\u0014\u0015\u0006\u0002\u0016\u0017\u0004\b\u0006\u000e\t\u0007\u0002\u0018\t\u0019\u000e\r\u000e\u001a\u0002\u0013\u0002\u001b\u001b\u001b\u001c\u0017\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u001d\u001e\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u001c\u0007\u0004\u001e\u0002"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"True, the Magician does work in regions which would bedescribed by the Scientist as fantasy worlds: but he is not a Magicianunless he is trying to bring about some change in himself or his envi-ronment in the process. A Dadaist ‘happening’ is Magic if it isperformed in order to ‘shatter middle class morality’, to ‘change ourawareness of the meaning of art’, or to ‘make money’. If on the otherhand, it is done for its own sake, or as a despairing or spontaneous act,then it is Art. Similarly, the controlled drug experience with somesuch aim as ‘self knowledge’ or ‘the invocation of genius’ is Magicwhereas a sociable freak-out is probably not.I do not want to give the impression of belittling Art — it is notthat Artistic thought is chaotic and aimless, but rather that, likeReligion, it has motives which are more subtle than the ‘in order to’motives of Magic and Science.So a popular idea of Magic as a thrilling bat and virgin infestedescape from the boring world of Science’s creation is in fact tangen-tial to real Magic: the Scientific mind has created an enemy moreexciting than Science itself. Books on Magic which fail to present thebizarre and sinister are not therefore attempts to whitewash thesubject, but are probably genuine books on elementary Magic.On the other hand, this bizarre world of goats and blood is farfrom being irrelevant to Magic. It is a world which has power oversome minds — all the more so for being rejected as ‘unreal’ byScience. For that reason alone it is a ‘real’ world in terms of Magic,and so could be used. A Magician wanting to generate maximumpsychic tension in his ritual does well to introduce these elementsprovided that he is able to control them: for even if they prove to bethe gothick recreation of an over-materialistic Victorian age, theyhave got sufficient hold upon our imagination to be useful.

If so, what about those fraudsterswho have successfully mimicked doctors or surgeons and got awaywith it — does that disprove medical science?In fact the Scientist is demanding that astrology or clairvoyance,a subject which has been neglected and left to be the hobby ofeccentrics for over a century, should be more accurate and reliablethan medicine — where practitioners have to study intensively foryears and be examined to the highest standards. Once again theScientist needs to create the impossible in order to refute it.Just as in Religious times, we were warned of man’s tendency to‘follow weakly in the ways of the Devil’, nowadays we are taught thatthe mechanism of our brain is imperfect as a computer, and so thebrain is susceptible to illusion and group hysteria. Instead of originalsin, we have mechanical imperfection, instead of evil, we have illusionor fraud.

Thismagic un-truth world seduces the Scientific mind, as did the Devilseduce the Religious. The Scientific thinker wants un-truth andreacts irrationally when disappointed of it: Un Geller is despisedbecause he fails to bend any spoon under any condition that theScientist imposes.We still use the word ‘magic’ to describe this world of un-truth,but I would argue that it is a world closer to my use of the word ‘Art’,For Art, a combination of feeling and intuition, is the polar oppositeof Science’s logic and observation.The Scientist, using the word ‘magic’ in this way, would not likemy suggestion that observation is basic to Magic. For him, magic isthe ultimate escape from his idea of the world: magic is about fantasy,dream worlds, uncontrolled drug experiences and Dadaist-typehappenings. But this is a mistaken idea. -     - "},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"CHAP TER 4ADemons and sacrificesFor a fuller exploration of the demonic, the fascination of the shadow sideand the nature of magical pacts with demons, see my third volume of essaysWhat I Did In My Holidays.See also the second volume of essays — Blast Your Way To Megabuck$With My SECRET Sex-Power Formula — for the title essay includes anexploration of the myth of Dionysus as a battle between control and ecstacy.It points out that the desire to control has a way of invoking an opposite reac-tion — as in mind-control cults which so often turn paranoid. Just as thearrival of Dionysus seemed to coincide with the apogee of Greek civilisationand social stability, so also, in present times, just as government gains themost sophisticated technology for controlling the people, precisely then doesthere arise a Dionysian madness in the population to defy that control. Inthose cases where government does triumph over the people — eg in NaziGermany, China and the Soviet Union — then the madness will tend toinfect government itself.I see this argument as qualifying the remarks in the last chapter aboutScience creating a devil more exciting than itself. I was very much aware ofthe extent to which the transition of fashion away from Science towardsMagic in the sixties was a Dionysian reaction against the know-all smugnessof Scientific opinion. I would add this to my list — in Chapter 3A — ofreasons why Science gives way to Magic.Some people find it hard to swallow my use of the words ‘devil’, ‘demon’,‘angel’ to describe what they see as simply complex processes. When Idescribe, say, an inferiority complex as a personal demon, or I personify theweather or nature as a god, or when I speak of ‘the media’ as if it was a livingentity — is this no more than a throw-back to primitive animism? Or is itsimply a confusion of everyday processes with ‘real’ demons?The real question is this: what makes the human brain so much morecomplex than the brain of other apes? Has all this processing power evolvedto handle tools? or is the complexity required to handle social relationships?Personally, I believe that no mechanical process is more complex than ourfellow human beings, and that the human brain has developed first and fore-most because of social pressure from other humans. So that when we addressa complex problem — eg the weather, market forces, a misbehaving car or acrowd — then greater brain power is available if we anthropomorphise theproblem.these elements of thought, and they are seldom found in such a purestate, least of all when one is the dominant system.In a previous age, a Religious investigation of Magic, Art orScience would in fact reach definite conclusions: everywhere it wouldfind evil, seduction or heresy respectively. Similarly in our own age, itwould be surprising if a Scientific investigation actually came to noconclusions about Magic. Such cautious or evasive days are long past.Almost certainly we would now expect the conclusion to contain theelements ‘fraud’, ‘illusion’ or ‘self deception while under the influenceof a dominant personality’, all elements projecting from the dustbinworld of un-truth.Is this a sneer at so-called Scientific objectivity? Seen from aScientific viewpoint, it might seem objectionable to suggest that manis still deceiving himself as he used to in the past. But the very words‘deceiving himself ’ come from the Scientist’s dustbin world. I am asmuch making a plea that we should be more sympathetic towards theReligious dogmatists of old. The viewpoint is Magical; the respective‘moralities’ of Religion and Science cannot be applied.In fact a Scientific investigation which came to any conclusion infavour of Magic would be as disturbing to me as to other Scientists. -     - \u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0002\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0002\u0003\u0004\u0005\u0005\u0006\u0007\b\t\u0004\u0002\u0004\u000b\u0002\f\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u0002\u0010\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u0002\u0013\u0002\u0014\u0015\u0006\u0002\u0016\u0017\u0004\b\u0006\u000e\t\u0007\u0002\u0018\t\u0019\u000e\r\u000e\u001a\u0002\u0013\u0002\u001b\u001b\u001b\u001c\u0017\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u001d\u001e\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u001c\u0007\u0004\u001e\u0002"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"The books mentioned at the beginning of this chapter do not expand muchon the subject of animal sacrifices, as I recall — and I am buggered if I amgoing to read the bloody things right now just to see if I recall rightly. So Iadd a few words here.Blood sacrifice plays a very minor role in modern Magic — there is noth-ing even remotely approaching the massive global slaughter of turkeys for theChristmas ritual, or other world religious sacrifices. Indeed, the currentfusion of Paganism and Magic means that most Magicians feel very close tothe animal world and actively oppose animal sacrifice to the point of beingstrictly vegetarian. So I can only quote from mine own experience.My first animal sacrifice was not a conscious choice, it was largely drivenby circumstances. It happened when I was driving at high speed down acountry lane on my way to visit a new client for the first time. I was in a hurrybecause it was vital that I arrived in good time and made a good impression.But I hit a bird at speed and left it dead upon the road. In this narrow laneat rush hour it would have been dangerous to have stopped and walked back,and I did not have time to park and attend to the bird’s remains, so I simplydrove on — feeling bad. This bad feeling was not conducive to a good work-ing day, so I asked myself if there was any meaning in the bird’s death — whyhad it died? The answer was that it had died because I was driving fast intentupon doing well for my new client. I therefore decided to accept responsibil-ity for the death of the bird and to honour its death — and therefore its life— by making an exceptional conscious effort in my day’s work. The work Idid that day would be my very best as a tribute to the bird I had sacrificed forit. Many years on that day’s new client is still my best client.Some people might argue that the role of circumstance in that firstexample disqualified it for the term ‘ritual sacrifice’ — the death had simplyhappened and was only later made sacred and Magical. So I give anotherexample where I actually chose to kill — changing a few details because I donot think the reader has the right to know much about me, but it remainstrue in its essence.In the streets of Cheltenham I saw what I thought was a polythene bagflipping about in the wind — only there was no wind. Driving closer I saw itwas a kitten in mortal agony, its pale fur totally sodden and slimy from leap-ing and writhing in the wet gutter, one eyeball hanging out of its batteredhead. It must have been wounded by a car and been squandering its remain-ing eight lives for quite a while to have got into such a mess. I felt sick, buttoo squeamish and shocked to attempt to catch this leaping apparition andtry to locate a vet, so I decided to take its life as a ritual sacrifice. The kitten’sevident suffering left no time to decide a useful intent as would normally berequired of a Magical act, so I resolved to make a ritual sacrifice in its purestform and then direct the energy towards manifestation afterwards. I chose a -   The ‘rational’ objection to this is that, if we know that it is not a person,then we are setting off on a wrong initial assumption. But I suggest this is nota problem, because mechanistic explanations are not a separate category frompsychological ones, they are merely a subset. Most human behaviour caneventually be resolved into mechanical reactions, but nevertheless most inter-personal problems are more rapidly solved if you treat the other person as ahuman being rather than a complex mechanism.If, for example, my car is an erratic starter on exactly the days when I amin the greatest hurry, then it might prove better to ask “how does it know Iam in a hurry” than to insist that “it is only a car and cannot possibly know Iam in a hurry”. The former question might lead more quickly to the discov-ery of a loose contact which is disturbed when I slam the door harder — arational, mechanical explanation and yet one reached more efficiently byusing the full animistic potential of the human brain.A more realistic example is to consider what happened recently when theso-called ‘hedge funds’ had to be bailed out by the banks. They based theiroperation upon equations appropriate to the random movements of the stockmarket, and they were doing exceptionally well until the Asian crisis upsetthe market equilibrium. Suddenly they were performing worse than the‘intuitive’ share dealers. My interpretation of this was that a steady-statefinancial market is akin to a sleeping brain, and that it only wakes up inresponse to crisis. While it is ‘asleep’ its behaviour averages towards random-ness and can be handled by the mathematics of random processes; but whenit wakes up it is reacting and no longer random, so the equations no longerapply and the successful dealers are those who lay aside their formulae anduse skills more like human counselling or martial arts to ‘psychoanalyse’ themarkets.In these terms the Magical technique of personifying complexes, institu-tions and problems can be seen as a powerful approach. It uses the greaterpart of the brain where a strictly Scientific approach uses only the subset ofreasoning that is applicable to linear, mechanistic phenomena.I am not arguing now that Science is inferior to Magic — it is more aquestion of breadth versus depth, or parallel versus linear processing. WhenI discuss the Media, say, as if it was a god which does not act altogether inour interests, I am using the full breadth of my mental capabilities to analyseand predict media reactions. If instead I insist that ‘there is no such entity as“the Media”’ and I proceed to analyse it as a assemblage of individual bitsthen I am using only my rational function, but I may well be using that ingreater depth. What I do wish to claim is that Magical thought is not simplya more primitive form of Science. -     - "},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"the memory of those dead creatures which I offered as sacrifices — whereasI have indeed been haunted by other creatures that I have wronged.The same principle extends to less dramatic examples. I am not a vege-tarian and I try to accept some conscious responsibility for creatures andvegetables killed to feed me. The death is consecrated by my intention tocook well rather than create junk food. For some people the justification forthe sacrifice is that “this creature died that I might live” — personally I findthat disgusting because it simply trades my life for many others. I prefer toacknowledge that I could always skip a meal and so I am eating not to livebut for pleasure. To me life is cheap — in a day or two any dead creature oreven a piece of shit will soon be swarming with life — whereas joy is precious.Therefore I endeavour whenever possible to cook like an Artist, leave myplate clean and generally conduct my life as the sort of elevated being that Imight myself choose to be eaten by. -   cowardly technique of running over the kitten several times to ensure thor-ough death and then I picked the remains up with an old carrier bag andplaced it in a bin as a marginally more dignified resting place than the roadwould have been.Now I had the problem of completing the ritual, because there was nosuch obvious answer to the question of why the kitten had been killed.Instead of finding a meaning I had to provide it. So I thought back over myday until I recalled a lesson I had learned earlier in the day about focussingmy attention onto those things over which I had influence rather than worry-ing about matters beyond my control. I chose to dedicate the sacrifice to rein-forcing this lesson, so that the resulting improvement in my life would be thetribute which would give value to the kitten’s death. The precise mentalprocesses by which I carried out this ritual are beyond the scope of this essay,but can be suggested by my closing oration to the dead kitten which wassomething along these lines.“Kitten, I never knew you but I feel our fates have been bonded by myact of killing you. I regret this act, but seek in the solemnisation of it to tran-scend such regret. I therefore accept full responsibility for your death, and Idedicate its memory to reminding myself ever to focus my resolve towardsthose matters where I can exert influence rather than to dissipate my life inworrying about circumstances over which I have no influence or solution.Thus I intend that your death will for ever be a stimulus towards improvingmine own life, and that my life will thus be ever a living tribute to your deathand so to your life. Thank you, kitten.One concern remains, however, which is that my decision was unilateral— you could not partake of it and might have chosen otherwise. But that isprecisely an example of the problem I seek to resolve — I have no influenceover your wishes as you are dead and gone, therefore I will not concern myselfwith them and will rather focus strictly upon my own intentions and reac-tions. I feel a lightening of my heart and I recognise that as a loosening of thebond between us. Go forth, kitten-spirit, you are now free.”The wording might sound a touch majestic for an off-the-cuff oration,but it is surprising how far the act of taking responsibility for death addssolemnity to one’s utterances.I hate putting this sort of thing into the book, because I know how it canbe misread to confirm some people’s worst fears about Magic. It doeshowever illustrate the key feature, namely that one’s own feelings and obser-vation are the ultimate authority in Magic. It also underlines the importanceof finding or creating ‘meaning’.

But in fact thedistinction is only one of degree: experience suggests the brain main-tains a visual image by making many small eye-movements. If youforce yourself to stare fixedly and without blinking at an object, theimage soon wavers and even vanishes until the eye breaks yourrestraint and moves slightly in order to restore the picture.Even though there are circumstances when we cannot be surewhat is material and what is illusion, yet at least we can be sure of ourown experience of it at the moment of experience. Indeed for most ofus, ‘I think therefore I am’ is a satisfactory starting point. So let usstart with the world of everything that can be thought, everythingthat can be described, invented, imagined and conceived; a world ofall our impressions, memories and abstract thoughts which we candescribe or express. Let us call it the Mental World.Within this huge and ever-shifting world, we soon distinguishcertain types of thought which are slower and clumsier than others.These are the ‘images’. Whereas the thought ‘I wonder if it is time forlunch’ can pass in a flash — hardly even verbalised, the correspondingmental images take a little longer: there is the feeling of hunger, therapid memory scan of time elapsed since last looking at the clock, andthe visual image of the clock itself.These images form their own Image World within the MentalWorld. Examples of thoughts which exist in the Mental World, butwithout necessarily touching the Image World, occur in mathemat-ics, eg the square root of minus one or the fifth dimension.But within the World of Images, we find that some images areeven slower and clumsier than the others; in fact they possess inertia.Although the thought of lunch was virtually instantaneous, thereflection on it took a second or two, yet the physical action of gettingup and looking at the clock takes even longer, for here we are operat-ing with the most solid and cumbersome impressions — those whichform what is called the Material World. Experiences which take placein the Image World, but not in the Material, are called dreams orvisions.When considered in atomic terms, this Material World is itselfextremely rarified, and so it is natural to ask whether there is withinit an even solider world. What could be more solid than matter? The -  CHAP TER FIVEFantasy worldsIt was described earlier how discussion between Magic and Scienceflounders because the idea of causality — so important in Science —has no bearing upon Magic. Similarly we find that the Scientific ideaof existence is of no interest to the Magician. When the latter talksof a demon as being a “defect in his own pysche”, the Scientist islikely to remark “so you don’t actually believe that demons exist assuch”; a remark which is quite meaningless in Magical terms.Just as Magic theory avoids tangled arguments about causality byallowing causal connections to be total, so does it avoid existencearguments by assuming that everything exists.Although this immediately saves the Magician from perplexingdiscussions as to whether the flying pink elephants that haunt him arereal or not — and if not, why it needs a real psychiatrist to banishthem — it is also a potentially dangerous step. For a universe in whicheverything exists is a much larger and more confusing one. In it, amuddled thinker might try to open a door with the memory of a key,buy Freedom in a shop, settle an argument with a dagger, or feed hiscats on Love. In fact it is very necessary to have some sort of map orguide in such a universe.The way in which Magicians map their universe varies from sect tosect. This fragmentation is probably partly the result of centuries ofpersecution, but also due to the very nature of Magic, so it would betoo much to attempt a comprehensive description in this essay.Instead one example will be presented, an example based on theCabalistic scheme of ‘four worlds’.The obvious beginning point to a Scientist would be the materialworld, as of that he feels sure. Thus it is that we have inherited frompast Magicians attempts to describe the other worlds in terms of‘rarified forms of matter’ — not always very satisfactorily, matter initself being so rarified.Philosophically matter is not such a good starting point.Eyewitness accounts of an event can diverge to the point that we canno longer trust ‘seeing is believing’.

It is published in What I Did InMy Holidays.)But a common reaction is to argue that the statement is simplynot true, on the grounds of the Scientific belief that the materialuniverse is an extensive reservoir of undiscovered facts which areslowly being revealed to us by Science. Such an arguer will say: “YourImage World doesn’t contain an image of the far side of the Moon,does it? So that is something in the Material World which is outsidethe Image World.” But of course the Image World does containimages of the far side of the Moon — an uncountable number ofimages of this as of any other unvisited place. Only knowledge canprune those images to find the one which corresponds to the so-called physical reality.More subtly it can be asked whether the mind can be said tocontain a true representation of the actual physical distance betweenhere and the Pole Star. This seems tricky until you question what ismeant by an ‘actual physical distance’, and find that the questioner isin fact confusing his own Mental World with the Material. If it werepossible to travel over that distance, and so to experience it in thatway, then the image of that experience would represent the distance.The distance can be expressed in the Mental World in so manywords, or as a number of light years. To argue that this is not suffi-cient representation is to argue not about the Material World, butabout a concept in the Mental World. In fact physical actions are theonly arguments possible within the Material World.On a higher level, it is likely to be argued that there exist imageswhich cannot be described in words. For example, someone wouldask: “Who has ever found words to describe the Mona Lisa?”However a television picture of the Mona Lisa, for example, is adescription in words, the whole picture being transmitted in the formof a coded signal and then reconstructed. By an extension of thismethod, the image of the picture could be reproduced as faithfully asdesired. Those who argue that the ‘image’ is not the whole picture aremissing the point. It is the image which could be described in words:any indescribable impressions which accompany the image mustbelong to the Spiritual World, and so by definition, lie outside theMental World of words. -  elementary particles themselves? In practice, we find that our experi-ence of these particles is more of the nature of the Image or MentalWorld. It is as though the attempt to go down to something evenmore solid than matter results in a reflection back up to the less solidregions. Therefore we stop at this point and assume the MaterialWorld to be the last.But what about the other direction? Is there a larger and evenmore rarified world which contains the Mental World?From a logical point of view, it is convenient to assume that thereis a larger world, simply so that any impression which does not fit theworlds described can be assigned to it. In practice it is this outerworld which is most likely to be contested by Scientists; because if theMental World comprises all thoughts which can be expressed orverbalised, then presumably the larger world would contain conceptswhich could never be expressed in words. Therefore we choose to irri-tate the Scientist by calling this higher world the Spiritual World,and we justify its existence by declaring that since it seems impossi-ble to hold conclusive arguments upon topics such as Liberty andLove, then perhaps the words are simply labels for concepts whichdefy accurate verbal description.The Spiritual World was called a ‘higher’ world. This is a furthersource of irritation to the Scientist who assumes that the word‘higher’ is used as an indicator of value, ie as a Religious mind mightuse it. In fact it is only ‘higher’ in the sense of being larger and inclu-sive. A topologist would call it a ‘super’ space, but that sounds evenmore like a value judgement.It is difficult for people of this age, who are used to consideringthoughts to be a by-product of activity within the small box of ourhuman skull, to see how those thoughts can form a world bigger thanthe material universe around that human skull. Here the idea of ashiny metal sphere, which contains as a reflected image within it theentire universe without, can be helpful. But a better analogy is toconsider the whole of English literature and to see in what sense it istrue to say that all such literature is contained within the twenty sixletters of the alphabet, and still leaves room for all literature yet to bewritten.(Actually, the above-mentioned difficulty could be lessening sincethe first edition of this book — see the essay Turds Made Fresh which -     - \u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0002\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0002\u0003\u0004\u0005\u0005\u0006\u0007\b\t\u0004\u0002\u0004\u000b\u0002\f\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u0002\u0010\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u0002\u0013\u0002\u0014\u0015\u0006\u0002\u0016\u0017\u0004\b\u0006\u000e\t\u0007\u0002\u0018\t\u0019\u000e\r\u000e\u001a\u0002\u0013\u0002\u001b\u001b\u001b\u001c\u0017\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u001d\u001e\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u001c\u0007\u0004\u001e\u0002"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"of this essay.

For example, we could simplify to only two worlds, call-ing them ‘Matter’ and ‘Spirit’, but that is too simple to be useful tothe Magician.

And so on with the other worlds.Alternatively we can disagree about the position of the boundarylines, preferring perhaps to exclude energy from, the world of matter,and ascribing it to an etheric ‘force’ world which includes our physi-cal sensations and bodily urges.In this way there have grown up many different divisions of real-ity, some into four worlds (or ‘planes’), some into seven and some intomore. Though sectarians can disagree upon terminology or defini-tion, the basic idea or purpose of these classifications is simply thatwhich I have described.Thus it is useless to ask a Magician if God, angels or demons‘really exist’. Simply by saying the words, you have made them exist.Ask again whether these abstract entities can produce any effect onthe physical world and they already have — they have caused you toask questions.While mentioning the different systems, it might be an idea todivert slightly and to discuss the use of the word ‘dimension’ in thiscontext. Where I might use the phrase ‘higher world’ or even ‘superspace’, some would use the phrase ‘higher dimension’, and this strikesme as unfortunate because ‘dimension’ has a definite and differentmeaning to most people.The use of the word dimension is in origin like the use of thewords ‘ether’, ‘vibrations’ and ’unconscious’. It stems from the -  So every object in a lower world is in one to at least one corre-spondence with an object in a higher world. For the chair you sit on— so loved by homely philosophers — there is your correspondingvisual and tactile experience of it in the Image World. There are thewords ‘the chair you sit on’ in the Mental World, and there is aconcept in the Spiritual World which is touched upon when we askif the chair you sit on would be the same chair if it was re-covered orput in another room.On the other hand, every world contains objects which are notfound in any lower world. For example the Image World contains animage of a tree with clocks growing upon it, swelling from littlewatches to full size alarm clocks. This image corresponds to no real-ity in the Material World. Note however that, once pictured, it wouldbe possible to produce a partially satisfactory representation of thattree in the Material World. It might look quite good, but would neverbe the real living thing.Moving up to the Mental World, I can produce the phrase ‘time-plated sky tomatoes’, a perfectly acceptable choice of words and yet ithas no picture in the Image World. Again some vague visual repre-sentations float into view, of pale blue tomatoes in the sky, but theyfail to be really ‘time-plated’.In the Spiritual World, there is an ideal of which I am aware butcannot describe. It can however be represented by the word ‘justice’in the Mental World, and by a statuesque blindfold woman withscales in the Image World.So now we have divided the huge and confusing world of all expe-rience into four worlds, nested one within the other; the innermostone being composed of matter. If anything lies outside those fourworlds, then it cannot be experienced — we need only call it ‘theUnmanifest’. In this scheme, matter is seen as condensed idea,thought or energy, rather than images and thoughts being rarifiedmatter. With such a scheme in mind, we are less likely to confuse thelevels of reality, though different labels still allow for confusion indiscussion between Magicians.Basically this is the scheme of the Cabalists, who see the universein terms of creation; 1) an idea touches us, 2) it can be expressed, 3)an image or plan is formed, and 4) physical action results. But thelabels I have used are my own, or rather Johnstone’s, for the purposes -     - "},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"Having given an outline of the way in which a Magician might viewwhat Scientists would consider to be ‘fantasy worlds’, it is necessaryto suggest how he operates in those worlds.Firstly he simply includes them in his field of observation. Hereis another basic surprise for the Scientist who is likely to object to theword ‘observation’ being applied to a fantasy world. “What you meanis daydreaming!”But surely observation cannot be complete unless it records allimpressions which reach us? In practice we fall short of total obser-vation; we have to be selective. The Magician is supposed to attemptto make note of any impressions which could be relevant to his work-ing: although he may well stop short of his aim, it is likely that he willbe observing much more than the Scientist who limits his field ofobservation strictly to the Material World. There are times when aScientist would do well to admit certain subjective factors, especiallywhen they reveal a strong desire for a particular outcome to his work.Secondly the Magician admits that a problem in one world canoften be solved in a higher world. Let us say that the problem is oneof fitting a door in a confined space, and choosing a piece of wood forthe job. It could be a lengthy business in the Material World, luggingall your bits of wood into position one by one to see if any one is bigenough. It would be better to reduce the labour by working also in theImage World: just by picturing the shapes of some of your pieces ofwood — eg discs and beams — you can see which ones are not worthtrying in the gap. Even more certain is to work in the Mental World:measure your gap — ie reduce the problem to numbers — then goout and measure your bits of wood. If even that fails to find a suitabledoor for you, there might be a solution in the Spiritual World. Whya door? Why not a curtain? Do you really need anything?Here the difference between Magician and Scientist is the extentto which this process is held to work. A Magician is more likely toassume, from his experience of the rapid growth in the higher worlds,that any problem must have a solution somewhere up the scale.But probably it is of greatest interest to the reader to know what aMagician does when he works purely on a fantasy level — but here Iadd the reminder that it is not Magic unless in the long term there is -  Magicians who feel the need to attempt to justify themselves withScientific terminology. As will be explained later, a Magical theorycan be built around any Scientific one; the trouble is that theScientific theory moves on and leaves a Magical theory which isexpressed in outdated and therefore ridiculous, Scientific language.First it was ‘magnetism’, then the ‘ether’, then the ‘fourth dimension’and now the ‘collective unconscious’. I must stress that each theory isperfectly acceptable as a Magical theory, but its language does notread well to an unsympathetic Scientist or educated person.The idea of a fourth dimension suggests a model of the describedhigher worlds in terms of an increasing number of dimensions, hence.the use of the word by some Magicians.Certainly the Image World contains four dimensions, for itcontains time. Any past image can be considered alongside the pres-ent or future possibilities. What is more, there are some people whoclaim to experience fleeting fourth dimensional visual images, ie tosee an imaginary object from all sides at once.But the addition of one more dimension is insufficient to explaincompletely the extra size of the Image World: even within threedimensions it is bigger than the Material World. For the MaterialWorld is not continuous in space — the gaps between particles haveno reality in material terms. On the other hand we can imagine thegaps between atoms, and any point in that gap, for the Image Worldis continuous unlike the Material World.To a mathematician, the geometry of five, ten or an infinity ofdimensions presents no more theoretical difficulty than that of four.As all his ideas are contained in the Mental World, we thus realisethat the Mental World must itself contain an infinite number ofdimensions. This is in accord with the theory of the ‘SemanticDifferential’ where one would not expect to achieve total distinctionafter any finite number of steps.As for the Spiritual World, well the very idea of dimension seemsmeaningless in a world where polar opposites appear to converge.So for the benefit of those who prefer the ordinary use of theword, I have sketchily discussed my classification in terms of dimen-sionality but add the reminder that it is often used in a very differentway, with a meaning more like my use of the word ‘world’. -     - \u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0002\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0002\u0003\u0004\u0005\u0005\u0006\u0007\b\t\u0004\u0002\u0004\u000b\u0002\f\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u0002\u0010\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u0002\u0013\u0002\u0014\u0015\u0006\u0002\u0016\u0017\u0004\b\u0006\u000e\t\u0007\u0002\u0018\t\u0019\u000e\r\u000e\u001a\u0002\u0013\u0002\u001b\u001b\u001b\u001c\u0017\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u001d\u001e\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u001c\u0007\u0004\u001e\u0002"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"functions and ask “If you subtract the Martian elements, whatremains?”The state to work towards is that in which every item in yourImage World, and therefore also the Material, is immediately ascrib-able to the relevant planet, and inversely that the name of the planetis able to evoke a whole subworld of relevant images. But even beforethat state is reached, the Magician can attempt astral working. Theprocess is one of controlled day-dreaming, the control consistinglargely of the original choice of what region is to be explored.The Magician arranges circumstances conducive to day-dream-ing, ie a quiet, secluded and comfortable place. He also arranges theplace so that it will set him on the right lines: if his chosen region wasthat of Venus — or a more specific region such as ‘Venus in Libra’ —it would help to choose a rose garden or a boudoir. Failing that, hewould merely decorate his room with a few Venusian items. Veryoften the Magician merely makes sure that there are no violentlyantagonistic circumstances or effects around him, and then proceedsto direct his day-dream simply by using appropriate mental imagery.He might visualise a pink silk curtain before him with the symbol forVenus embroidered in pastel green, and commence his daydream bystepping through the curtain to a world beyond.For many people, the first experience of the astral plane is discon-certing, not for its vividness but rather for its feebleness. Unless theyare gifted with exceptional powers of imagery, they do not find them-selves swept into a vivid and dramatic dream-world.Close your eyes and you do not immediately banish yoursurroundings. You still have a feeling of the room around you, and itsposition in your world. How strong is that feeling? Can you actuallyvisualise each item of furniture and mentally walk around the room?Now try to imagine that you are really in a different, but equallyfamiliar, room, Can you again clearly visualise the new room in all itsdetail? Or can you merely produce a vague ‘feeling’ of the other roomwith a few fleeting visual images of parts of it?For many people the first astral experiences are no more vividthan that feeble feeling. The Venus world has to be willfullyconstructed around them, and constantly rebuilt as it fades. What ismore, they never lose the feeling of the original room in which theyare sitting in the Material World, even while the day-dream -  a definite aim to such work — in particular what is meant by skryingor ‘Astral Travelling’.It is not easy to describe Astral Travelling without making itsound very glamorous. The reader who comes across accounts ofastral visions should continually remind himself that the ‘astral world’in such cases is the Image World that I have described.Firstly the Magician needs a plan of his world. The scheme of thefour worlds was called a ‘plan’, but really it is more like a side eleva-tion, showing the whole universe of experience divided into fourstoreys — don’t let this slightly defective image obscure the fact thateach of my worlds includes all the worlds beneath it — and what theMagician needs is a plan of each storey.At first you might think of a map, and consider a globe of theEarth to be a good plan of the Material World. But where do nutsand bolts lie on that plan? Or hospitals? Or iron? Or stinking helle-bore? No, the sort of plan that is needed is one of those flexiblesystems of symbols mentioned earlier, a system like the Tree of Lifeof the Cabalists, or the tarot or astrology.Again I will choose astrology as an example; although as a plan itis not so popular with Magicians at the present time, at least it is themost widely known of the systems, We will take for our plan theplanets of the astrologers.The first objection is how can you call it a ‘plan’, for it is only a listof planets? The answer is that, when studied, the planets of astrology(and the elements of any Magic symbol system) exist not just asisolated boxes, but stand in definite relationships with one another:Venus and Mars are in a polar relationship which parallels Moon andSaturn or Jupiter and Mercury. So in a way which is unlikely to beclarified within the scope of this essay, the choice of the seven plan-ets does in fact provide a plan of our world. This plan will be appliedto the Astral, ie Image, World.Day by day, working in all worlds, the Magician constructs andreinforces the association with his chosen plan in the way which wassuggested in an earlier chapter. Should he feel a bit ignorant, or lack-ing, in any one planet, he will study the relevant correspondences. Letus say that he is least sure about Jupiter or cannot see what is itsessence. Then he should attend a few wine parties, study jovial peopleand experience their company, or else attend some open air sports -     - "},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"home and try to repeat the exercise on your own it can be a bit disap-pointing.In this brief essay, it would be unwise to go too deeply into Magicalterminology, simply because these terms are subject to a wide varietyof usages. But I would like to mention the terms ‘angel’ and ‘spirit’,‘archangel’ and ‘god’ as used in modern Cabalistic Magic.Entities which exist primarily as Images are called ‘spirits’. Somesuch images are specific to certain areas of the Image World, so wefind in our exploration Moon spirits, earth spirits (gnomes) and soon. Such traditionally well defined regions of the Image World tendto develop (or develop from?) a prime spirit called the ‘Angel’ of thatregion. There is also a negative counterpart called the ‘Demon’.Similarly in the Mental World, there is a president of the equiv-alent region called the, ‘Archangel’, and in the Spiritual World, thereis a ‘God’ of that region.So when we set out to explore, say, the Image World of Air, wewould tend to invoke or pray to the God of Air as protector — thisis analogous to getting permission from the highest authority. Yet wewould only expect to meet the Angel of Air in our journey.In fact any appearance in Image of an entity claiming to be anArchangel or God should be regarded with deep suspicion. Even if itis ‘true’ as a ‘message’, it should be realised that the Image is only a‘representation’ and therefore imperfect. The more proper appearanceof an Archangel is not a clearly defined image, but a shifting and hazyone — more like an attempted image of my ‘time-plated sky toma-toes’ or the ‘square root of minus one’. The appearance of a God ismore marked by a sensation of great awe, or numinosity, rather thanany describable image.These terms are given as examples only: although these arecommon meanings, some writers may use the words in a differentsense. The book Words Made Flesh contains an interesting analogybetween this angelic hierarchy and the hierarchy of programs whichmight be needed to create a virtual reality. It considers a virtual fieldof grass — each individual grass plant in the virtual reality has its ownsoftware representation (its ‘spirit’); all those plant spirits are deriva-tives of a program which identifies that particular grass species (the‘angel’ of that species) and it in turn is a derivative of a program which -  progresses. Their thought stream runs more on these lines: “There’sthe curtain. Now what ought I to find on the other side? A rosegarden on a warm sunny day, I think. Okay, here we go . . . yes, here’sthe garden around me. I should be able to smell roses I suppose . . .yes, that’s better. What else ought there to be? The sound of bees andsinging birds? Yes . . . damn, I forgot to leave a message for the milk-man . . back to the rose garden . . I suppose I could do it tomorrowmorning . . . where are the birds? It’s about time I met an occupantof this world — a young girl in soft silk clothes . . . “ And so on, eachpart of the scenery being put in its place because it ought to be there.But without necessarily growing more vivid, the dream does withpractice come to life. It begins to exhibit spontaneous elements whichon later consideration are in keeping with the Venus symbolism, andcan be checked with the experience of other Magicians. Should anydoubtful entities be met in any sphere, then there exist traditionaltests which can be applied and which will either banish the entity orelse confirm its validity. The Magician can also meet a guide in histravels who will show him around the world and answer questionsabout it.Thus the Venus world which started as a sort of mental filingcabinet in which he placed appropriate symbols, has become a newcoherent world of experience, and one in which the Magician canlearn. What he learns about the world of Venus will, when meditatedupon after the journey, teach him lessons about the correspondingelements in everyday life.If it seems hard to believe that such a collection of symbols can‘come to life’, it is as well to consider what often happens whenpeople become interested in psychology. If Freud is their teacher, theybegin to have Freudian-style dreams. At first, these are likely to beimitative, a construction of other people’s dreams which have beendescribed in books, but soon they will experience their own Freudiandreams, ie the world of Freudian symbols has ‘come to life’.One way to improve the initial vividness of these ‘daydreams’ is toshare them. The ‘pathworking’ is a magical group exercise where,typically, everyone closes their eyes and visualises while one memberof the group describes the inner journey. The results are usually farmore vivid and coherent when done in a group — and when you go -     - \u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0002\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0002\u0003\u0004\u0005\u0005\u0006\u0007\b\t\u0004\u0002\u0004\u000b\u0002\f\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u0002\u0010\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u0002\u0013\u0002\u0014\u0015\u0006\u0002\u0016\u0017\u0004\b\u0006\u000e\t\u0007\u0002\u0018\t\u0019\u000e\r\u000e\u001a\u0002\u0013\u0002\u001b\u001b\u001b\u001c\u0017\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u001d\u001e\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u001c\u0007\u0004\u001e\u0002"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"that clear visual imagery is likely to obstruct abstract thought orreason.In this context, it is interesting that the original pictorial Chinesecharacters were at one time expressly formalised and obscured inorder to make them more suitable for abstract use, Furthermore, thisidea is in keeping with the idea that a surfeit of toys is likely toobstruct a child’s imagination, or that too much intellect is a bar tospirituality. In each case, an excess in one world is a hindrance toexperience in the world beyond it.There is a Magical theory which states that a ‘male’ is positive inthe Material and Mental Worlds, and negative in the Image andSpiritual Worlds (and vice versa with a female), and thus it is that our‘male’ scientific thinking is likely to neglect imagination and spiritu-ality in favour of material and intellect.

On the other hand, neithermust you think that it in any way belittles the astral world when Idescribe it in terms of day-dreams. Is there any idea or invention inthis world which was not foreshadowed in a daydream?In this chapter it has been explained that, although it is literally trueto say that the Magician works in the realm of fantasy, it is mislead-ing to say so unless there is also an idea of how those fantasy worldsrelate to other people’s ideas of reality. -  defines grasses (the ‘archangel’ of grasses) and that is in turn a deriv-ative of a program which defines vegetation (the ‘god’ of vegetation).When considerable experience is gained of all the worlds (to omitknowledge of any world would be to lay yourself open to the dangerof unrecognised elements from that world invading the others), thenthe astral equivalent of Ritual Magic can be attempted: a ritual isenacted or action taken, in a higher world which is intended toprecipitate a desired event in the Material World. The mechanics ofthis method are of no interest to the practical Magician, though sointriguing to the Scientist that he will soon perceive or project themhimself. When the Magician asks his Venusian guide to “makeAmanda marry me”, and the Venusian guide says “I will if you obeymy instructions: first you must wash yourself all over and put on cleanfresh garments...” then the mechanics will seem laughably obvious tothe Scientist.This account of astral working is likely to offend people of twoextremes. First it will offend those whose imagery is so vivid andpowerful, and whose astral travels are so successful, that they willobject to the idea that the astral world is ‘only a day-dream’. To suchpeople I reply that I disagree with their use of the word ‘only’. It isthe fault of Scientific education that they think that a day-dream isnecessarily trivial; remember that in the account here given theMaterial World is ‘only’ that small part of the daydream world whichis capable of standing up to certain tests.Secondly it will offend those whose imagery is so feeble, ornonexistent, that they will not believe such day-dreams to be possi-ble.Someone with a name like Galton around the turn of this centuryinvestigated the differences in people’s power of imagery and foundthere was a full range, from those who did not even believe it possi-ble through those who had fleeting black and white images whichcould not be held or scrutinised, to those who could visualise sovividly that they were actually able to open their eyes and ‘project’ theimages in order to see them as if through their eyes. Although hiswork was inconclusive, it did suggest a possibility which seems intu-itively quite likely: that the more abstract thinkers such as mathe-maticians were less likely to have good visual imagery, or conversely -     - "},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"more respectfully, knowing that nothing more can come from this pen?When the author is living, do we become distracted by the living presence,wanting to put down the book and question or challenge the author forourselves? Johnstone wanted to step back from his ideas, retreat intoanonymity and allow them to be studied in their own right without the irri-tation of an author and the reader’s fantasies surrounding him.Being considered as ‘an original thinker’ is a vital part of being groomedas a vehicle for selling books — and yet it was something that Johnstoneeschewed. He was more keen to present traditional ideas in a fresh light thanto replace them with something new. And yet his ideas often do seem new.For example, at the beginning of the 1970s he was suggesting that thebasis for our reality might be neither matter, nor energy but simply informa-tion — ie that we could be living in a ‘virtual reality’ to use a term which didnot appear until many years later. This is an idea which is still consideredrevolutionary.But Johnstone did not see it so much as a new idea but rather as a handymodern metaphor for an ancient tradition that our reality is an illusion or‘maya’. Note how, in the previous explanation of the four levels of reality, theworlds of archetype or idea are seen to come before solid matter. At eachstage — from spirit to concept, from concept to image, from image to matter— there is a change of state which is comparable to the difference betweenan underlying software and the experience of virtual reality it can generate.Plato had his own metaphor to describe this virtual reality: it was of acave upon whose inner wall shadows are cast from the light shining into thecave. In this model what we call ‘the real’ world is those shadows cast by thereality behind us. What Johnstone considered was simply the television tubeas the modern version of the cave — we live out the soap opera world castupon the phosphor screen and are barely mindful of the stream of data direct-ing the movements of the electrons hitting and illuminating that screen. Inthe case of a computer screen, that stream of data is itself a product of thesoftware which lies behind it.In my additions to this text, notably in the following chapters 6A and 7A— I expand upon the idea of a virtual universe because it does indeed providea very useful metaphor for Magical theories. But what is not intended is thatthe reader should be ultimately seduced by the metaphor. In Words MadeFlesh I propose a walking meditation in which you imagine that the worldwe live in is a virtual reality programmed into a great computer and you goabout life looking at it as a bit of clever programming — noting how cleverlyand how smoothly colours, textures, perspective, tastes and other phenome-non have been built into the experience and how realistic are the other char-acters in this world.

Now the reader can judge for himself, as this essay presents a conciseand elementary account of his theories on the nature of Magic, and is an excellentintroduction to the subject for the intelligent layman. It will also be of interest tothose who have some knowledge of Magic, because no-one was better able thanJohnstone to describe traditional Magical doctrine in the context of modern life. Inthis account Magic comes closer to all of us, without losing its fascination.It is a rare pleasure to find a Magical writer who does not limit himself to anindulgent ‘ripping away of the surrounding veils of mystery and illusion’, but whois prepared also carefully to restore those veils lest there be any doubt that the subjectis indeed Magic.What message was being conveyed by this? Why, for a start, the use of thepast tense? Why restore those ‘veils of illusion’? The writer was clearly concerned about a tendency which has becomeeven more extreme since the book was written: the tendency for a book tobecome more important than its content or its author.There always has been some imbalance. I recall an elderly Irish poetneighbour telling me of his dream which was to be sitting opposite a stun-ningly beautiful girl in a railway carriage and to discover that the book whichis absorbing all of her attention turns out to be a volume of one’s own poems.I too was brought up in the tradition that an idea for a book was a compen-satory gift with which a less than gorgeous human being might reducemembers of the opposite sex into melting adoration — ie that an idea, and abook should be tools to serve the writer.What Johnstone noted was a tendency for the idea and the author tobecome subservient to the book. The correct approach to a publisher nowa-days is not to send a manuscript or book proposal, but rather a good-look-ing photo of oneself plus a professionally produced curriculum vita outliningone’s claim to fame.

In both cases, experience has taught that thequestion itself probably betrays the asker as one who will never seethe point. So often it is the sign of either the opening of hostilities,or else of the hungry thrill-seeker who begs always to be surprisedand delights only in announcing that he is not.As before, the question will not be answered but dismissed atlength. For secretly, strictly between ourselves, Magicians too find thereasons for its dismissal somewhat intriguing. Many a tickle-ribbedhour can be passed listening to Scientists who — whilst repeatedlyacknowledging Occam’ s Razor as their guide — yet prefer to suggesta complex barrier of trickery, mechanical gadgetry, obscure humanmotive and of course illusion, rather than admit the one alternativepossibility... that they do not know everything.In view of our education and our strong resistance to the miracu-lous, is it not itself a miracle that people still believe in the supernat-ural?How can we fail to believe in miracles when there are so manyrecorded in history? Once there was a simple answer — that theywere all lies; now it is suggested that self-deception, imperfectmemory and wrong conditioning are to blame.and abandon the idea of a great computer — stop imagining it but try to holdonto the Magic it invoked.This process of ‘pulling oneself up by your own bootstraps’ is not allowedin Scientific thinking where a model based upon a false premise must beinvalid — but it is no problem in Magical work. So what is here beingsuggested is that we accept the cybermagic arguments as a technique forovercoming the resistance to Magic which current materialistic models ofreality impose upon us — but that we should not fall into a new form ofrestraint by insisting that our world ‘really is’ a computer simulation.All you need for Magic is a belief that world of the senses is not ‘all thereis’ and that there is some underlying level of reality — archetypal forms,thoughts, information processing, natural laws or whatever — which can bemanipulated to alter or shift this illusion of experience. -     - "},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"until the sighting got into the news, and then there was a flood ofreports. This to him was evidence that the whole thing was a masshallucination, and he apparently did not think it necessary to considerother possibilities. Surely if there really were flying saucers, just thesame thing would happen? Once one report hit the news, people whonormally stayed indoors would go out and look at the sky. Again notethe double standard: whereas in Science repeated observation is seenas confirmation of Truth, in any other field it is seen as confirmationof hallucination.So what happens when we see a miracle? The answer is that wesee a ‘conjuring trick’. But what if trickery is ruled out? Of course itnever can be, but even then we can call it ‘an hallucination’. After UriGeller had bent his spoons, many people were relieved to hearconjurors announce that they too could do it. So relieved were theythat they never bothered to subject those conjurors to any stringenttests. As Houdini showed, the best publicity any conjuror can get isto claim that he can duplicate others’ achievements. Perhaps thediscovery that a conjuror could fool them would be too embarrassing?Instead of being skeptical about the conjuror’s claims, Scientificinvestigators actually rely upon the conjurors to help them to arrangeimpossible tests for the supernatural. The attraction of the conjurorto the Scientist is that he is the embodiment of the Scientific beliefin human gullibility and deception. Science asks the paragons ofdeception to lead it to the truth. (See a later essay The Charlatan AndThe Magus — reprinted in Blast Your Way To Megabuck$ With MySECRET Sex-Power Formula — for a more profound exploration ofthe role of trickery and deception in Magic, Science and life.)We are protected from the miraculous by the comforting possi-bility of rational explanation. To suggest that there could ever be amiracle story capable of breaking through that defence is to suggestthat there is a finite limit to man’s power to invent. So there comes atime when we grow bored of trying to outrun reason, and insteadwonder what happens when we are actually witness to a miracle situ-ation. This is more difficult especially since it is now less easy to findpeople who do not believe in hypnotism.The technique used is called ‘post-hypnotic suggestion’. It ispossible to hypnotise a person, and tell him that he will obey certaincommands or perform some action spontaneously, after he has come - So does that mean that only dimwitted people ever ‘see’ miracles?Alas, no. Even otherwise intelligent and well-educated people likeJung and Crookes occasionally succumb. We are none of us perfect.But the fact that ‘well educated’ people of our century see fewermiracles than do primitive people is seen as confirmation that theyare in fact aberrations of the mind.To the Magician this is rather amusing: the fact that in order notto see miracles we have to be taught not to see them. It is also a littlesad for us moderns who have had such teaching thrust upon us.The Scientist who prefers not to accuse people of lying believesthat primitive people see magic only because they are taught tobelieve in it, yet in many cases he overlooks the possibility that wemight not seemagic only because we were taught not to believe init.Once you have gained an understanding of your own defenses, itis interesting to study them in others, for they exist on more than onelevel, Easiest to observe is the intellectual resistance to the miracu-lous.Critics of mystery delight in pointing out that the human mindlikes to remember selectively interesting coincidences — a fact whichseems hardly remarkable, and yet overlook the more surprising factthat we often ignore these coincidences.Keep a diary and note your dreams. Select a few examples whichseem to illustrate the popular idea that dreams are based upon areordering of the past day’s experience. Very often the connections arefairly tenuous. Take half a dozen such examples, and you will be ableto convince most people that dreams are a re-hash of the day’simpressions. Now reverse your examples in time and present them asa case for precognition — you will be laughed out of court.Lemuel Johnstone once attempted to quantify people’s relativeresistance to the miraculous by increasing the number of examples inthe second case until they were considered as ‘proof ’ of precognitionin the same way as they had previously been ‘proof ’ of memory. Inwhatever way he shuffled his examples he found a curious fact, thatthe more he presented the more ludicrous his case seemed.A similar effect was observed on a television programme aboutflying saucers over Oxfordshire, England.

Theresult was not “oh well, you’ve convinced me now”, but somethingcloser to a nervous breakdown.The rational view of the world is ultimately a logical one. Toadmit one little miracle or inconsistency into a logical system is notas harmless as you might think. It causes complete disruption.An example of such a logical system is arithmetic. If we obey allthe rules of arithmetic but allow just one wrong result, then anywrong result can be proved. Let us say that we allow that 5 + 7 =10,therefore 12 =10, therefore 12 - 10 = 0, therefore 2 = 0. Divide bothsides by 2; then 1 = 0. This means that all numbers are now equal to0 (eg multiply both sides by 100 to get 100 = 0), and therefore allequal to each other. In other words the whole of arithmetic collapsesif we admit one single illogical result into the system.So when something in a rational mind takes such pains to avoida confrontation with the miraculous, it is not being awkward ordeceptive, it is defending the consciousness from total chaos.Try not to see this personal adjustment of reality as a fraud, for theconcept of fraud is merely a projection from Science’s ‘shadow world’.At every moment, we are surrounded by a multitude of impressions,so it is necessary to be selective if we are to cease meditating and starttaking action. A city dweller is not continuously aware of the soundof traffic, or the starlings, and yet he will catch the faint tinkle of acoin dropped on the pavement. It is necessary to be selective.If a racialist is convinced that all Negroes are unintelligent andbestial oafs, and yet he watches a discussion programme involvingwell-educated Negroes, it will merely confirm his opinion “who thehell do they think they are putting on airs like that”. If you take aScientist to a spiritualist seance, the better the show the more it willconvince him that the whole thing is a fraud.Somewhere in our mind, a censor sifts the impressions in order toguarantee a comfortable and consistent mental environment. It is nota swindler: it is more like a loving aquarist who provides a goldfishwith water, plants and artificial rocks to make it feel at home. That iswhy some people call it ‘the Guardian Angel’. Until you come face toface with this Guardian Angel, your world will not change. - round from the hypnotic trance. In this way it is possible to confrontsomeone with a miracle and watch his reaction.A favourite example is to say that a certain person in the room willvanish when one command is given, but will reappear when anotheris given. So it is possible to present the subject with a human who willvanish and reappear instantly before him. But, to your disappoint-ment, the subject does not shriek: “My God, Joe’s vanished”, hemerely looks away. If you ask him where Joe is he will not tell you “hevanished before my very eyes”, but will make some very ordinaryreply like “Joe went out” or “Joe must have gone”. When Joe instantlyreappears, he will merely say “ah, you’re back”. For his mind will coverup the miracle by superimposing a normal exit and return. As far ashis conscious mind is concerned, he has not witnessed any miraclebut simply Joe’s comings and goings.The next experiment is to force him to stare directly at the invis-ible Joe and therefore to see what is behind him. You will find thatthe subject will think of many good reasons not to co-operate, but ifyou force him to, say, read a notice while the invisible Joe standsbefore it then you will be sorry to find that you yourself are unable tosee miracles. For the subject will appear perplexed and the suggestionwill break down. You have been saved.No matter how bizarre you make the subject’s action underposthypnotic suggestion, you will find that his mind can devise arational explanation. A shy young man will stand up in the middle ofa lecture and shout ‘hot stew!’ without any justification. But if you askhim why, he will be unlikely to say that ‘dark forces compelled him’.If he is rational, he will believe that he did it to prove to himself thathe was not in an hypnotic trance, or some such reason.Why is it so important for us not to see miracles? In discussion ofsuch subjects, you will find that some people not only do not believe,but are actually ‘disturbed’ that anyone could still believe in themiraculous. Once you have made a devil, he has the power to frightenyou. But this fear also exists at a more basic level.A colleague once was privileged to find someone who really didnot believe in hypnotism, and still did not believe after many demon-strations.

There is a name for the intermediate state; it is called‘insanity’.But unless you have passed through that state, what proof haveyou that it is only intermediate? Looking towards Magic, Science seesonly a fog which it calls ‘insanity’, and as is often the way withScientific terminology, the word itself is mistaken for an explanation.We assume that once Science has a word for it, then we know allabout it.So don’t ask a Magician to demonstrate miracles. You will never seethem until you cease to be what you are, ie you will never see them.But what of those people who have witnessed miracles? Whathappened to their defenses?A miracle is only a total disaster to a rational thinker. If by natureyou are a ‘feeler’ rather than a ‘thinker’, you can happily survive a fewinconsistencies. However you are unlikely nowadays to suffer verylarge inconsistencies because whatever your natural bent you arelikely to have been educated as a thinker — and I mean more thanjust education gained in the classroom. Therefore your GuardianAngel might allow you a few bizarre events, but will probably saveyou from witnessing anything which is likely to make you into asocial misfit. As was explained earlier, the modern Magician can hopefor runs of luck or some ‘amazing coincidences’, but he should notexpect too many gold coins to materialise from thin air. Especiallynot if he is by nature talkative.In this context it is interesting to wonder whether it is thestrength of Scientific beliefs which gives them their power to unifyour experience: is Science the safest way of all?

This could be a disaster for our ‘macrocosmic’universe as it could lead to ‘looping’ of the program as the inner ‘microcosms’modelled the macrocosm itself. The macrocosm has survived, however, byevolving a defence against such cancerous eruptions, which is to isolate suffi-ciently complex microcosms by imparting an illusion of ‘separateness’. Eachmicrocosm is tolerated because it now feels itself to be separate from themacrocosm.This sense of separateness is what we experience as ‘consciousness’. Thispoint of self realisation by a universe has been symbolised in various waysover the ages as twoness or multiples of two. For example:1) George Spencer Brown in The Laws Of Form describes an elemental‘split’ from which a complex system evolves — oh bugger, I cannot findthe book on my shelves to quote. That means I must have lent it to some-one so many years ago that I’ve forgotten and have no chance of recover-ing it.2) The I Ching describes how all manifestation arises from an initial divisionof the Tao into two principles Yin and Yang and thus into the multipleseight and sixty four and so on.3) Those who see the universe as a devilish illusion symbolise this by givingthe Lord of Duality two horns.4) IHVH in the cabalistic system is a fourfold formula for conscious mani-festation translated as “I am that I am”And so on. (I am still angry about that missing book. It can be a close friendfor years and yet you only have to look away for a decade and it is gone with-out a trace. Life is a bitch.)Thus we have described three levels of experience. Firstly, to the macro-cosm it is the processing of digital information. Secondly, what is beingmodelled is a smooth universe based on continuous mathematical equations.This smooth reality is only experienced by conscious microcosms, and they,thirdly, experience it only as binary digital information. This is like the way Ionly experience the continuous Mandlebrot set in my computer when Iinvoke it as pixellated screen images — only in our reality the consciousnesslies within the universe that it perceives. So also the physicist who wishes topin down which slit the photon passed through can only do so by destroyingthe wavelike continuity of light. (I should explain that this model evadesPenrose’s argument in ‘Shadows of Mind’ because it places consciousness notwithin any algorithmic program but in the relationship between the micro-cosmic program and the macrocosm which contains it).Magic, then, is to ‘surf ’ the unconscious continuity of existence until adesired state is sensed and only then is conscious attention allowed to seize - ,    CHAP TER 6ASo, can Magic defy physics?I gather that, three decades on, the final paragraph of the last chapter needselucidation. At the risk of spoiling a good joke, I’ll have a go.The relevant point of misunderstanding between Magic and physics isthat physics assumes a physical reality and Magic only assumes an illusion ofphysical reality.That does not mean that Magic undervalues the physical world as someReligions appear to. The word “illusion” does not have negative connotationsin Magic because all is considered to be an illusion. So saying “matter ismaya”, or “an illusion created by Hermes the Trickster” or whatever is reallyjust an invitation for matter to “join the club”. Quite a compliment, really.There have been many attempts to portray this illusion of reality over themillennia, but I’ll stick to Johnstone’s model of a virtual reality as it is eveneasier to grasp as the century ends than it was when he first proposed it in1970.THE MODELFor a fuller explanation see Chapter 7A: but the basic idea is that universeswill tend to evolve within an ‘information soup’ as internally structured infor-mation systems in a manner analogous to the way intelligent life-forms areassumed to have evolved from a ‘chemical soup’. Just as with the evolution ofcomplex life-forms, it is the complexity of the internal structure that offerscertain survival advantages. Thus an information structure which models aninner universe with consistent physical laws and its own evolved life formswill compete better for the processing power of the information soup.Now the problem arises when we move from the outer appreciation ofthis virtual reality to an inner experience of it.Take the Mandlebrot set program in my Mac computer as an example.This ‘contains’ a two-dimensional world of infinite size and uncountably infi-nite complexity of detail. Because it represents a universe defined by contin-uous equations, it is infinitely bigger than the small program which containsit; but it is only unfolded from those equations screen by screen as an outsideintelligence calls them up. Although infinitely rich in content, it has only twodimensions and no time dimension — so it cannot include its own models ofintelligent life as our universe does, and it depends upon outside intelligenceto unfold it.Our universe does have a time dimension, and it can and has evolved tocontain its own inner information processing systems. Some of these brainshave evolved — as did the universe itself — sufficient complexity to model"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"CHAP TER SEVENThe nature of Magical theoryThe question of the miraculous was only considered very sketchilypartly because it is not very important to a practicing Magician, butalso because it is unwise to appear to be trying to convert people toMagic. As was explained, a single coherent world-view is a preciousasset, bestowing all the benefits of what we call ‘sanity’. The purposeof dealing with the subject at all is identical to the purpose of thiswhole essay: it is to present a modicum of encouragement to those forwhom the Magical way of thinking would be natural, and for whomthe pressure to conform to apparently (to them) ludicrous Scientificfashions is unpleasant. Such people need few words about Magicaleffects. A more important topic is Magical theory.Unless the nature of Magical theory is understood, it is very easyto get the impression that Magical theory (and for that matterReligious theory) is forever being defeated by the progress of Science.In view of the conclusion reached in Chapter Three about the inde-pendence of the four systems of thought, it would indeed be strangeif Science was able to defeat Magic in this way (or vice versa for thatmatter). But the mistaken belief that Science is at war with Magic orReligion apparently leads many people to despise Scientific progressas though it were an act of aggression. Thus we find people, oftenassociated with fey Religious or spiritualist sects, who betray anger inthe face of Scientific theory in such words as ‘what nonsense toreduce Love to a chemical reaction in the body’. Very often theysimultaneously reveal that they have a lot of the qualities of aScientific mind: their apparent rejection of the theory scarcelyconceals a total belief in it, or resignation to it, and goes along with abelief that the whole world is going downhill (in Chapter 3A this isexplained in terms of a legacy of skepticism in Magic).The idea that an equation of Love and a chemical reaction meansthat Love has somehow been reduced to a chemical reaction seems tobe peculiarly characteristic of the modern Scientific mind. It is pecu-liar because it is not obvious how it should arise via a process of logicand observation; possibly it is a hangover from Religious thought ofthe outcome. Whereas Science uses conscious attention to stay within thedigitised, particulate perception of the universe, Magic only uses that swordwhen it wishes to break the continuum.THE EXAMPLEYou are in a taxi on your way back from a late night party. As you turn intoyour road you note the taxi meter reading just over four pounds so you reachin your pocket for cash and find it EMPTY!Horror! Nothing to pay the taxi with. You face a crisis and you takeMagical action. For example:1) You might have a belief that the universe is basically benign and will lookafter you. So you outwardly or inwardly cry “help! I haven’t got enoughcash!”2) You might have time to perform a traditional Magical act such as Spare’ssigillisation technique, clutching a talisman or whatever.3) You might assume a benevolent deity — say Mammon, Jesus, Jupiter orGanesha — and offer devotion to it in return for help.Whatever your Magic, you now sit back with a hopeful sigh and your handbrushes against something hard in the crack at the back of the seat. There arefive pound coins nestling there! You now have the money to pay the driver.Now a really bold Magician can just accept that the Magic has worked,that the surfing stopped just at the point where coins would be found in theseat. There is, however, a strong tradition among Magicians that an opera-tion should end with a banishment.A typical inner banishing ritual goes as follows. “That’s a bit of a coinci-dence — that I should find just the right coins to pay the fare just as I neededthem. On the other hand, I cannot believe I would have been stupid enoughto set out in a taxi without checking I had cash — even after a party. I betthose coins were in my pocket all along and simply fell out as I sat in the taxibecause of the rake of the seat. Yes. That must be what really happened.”Banishing Magic in this way is actually quite good Magic. It is onlydangerous if you come to ‘believe in’ this explanation, or start to congratulateyourself for ‘seeing it’. Just as it would be equally dangerous to boast to othersthat you can make coins appear at will. In Western Magical tradition we areencouraged to cultivate four ‘powers’, namely to know, to will, to dare... andto keep silent. -     - \u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0002\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0002\u0003\u0004\u0005\u0005\u0006\u0007\b\t\u0004\u0002\u0004\u000b\u0002\f\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u0002\u0010\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u0002\u0013\u0002\u0014\u0015\u0006\u0002\u0016\u0017\u0004\b\u0006\u000e\t\u0007\u0002\u0018\t\u0019\u000e\r\u000e\u001a\u0002\u0013\u0002\u001b\u001b\u001b\u001c\u0017\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u001d\u001e\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u001c\u0007\u0004\u001e\u0002"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"it degenerates it develops characteristics of Magic: a Magician has thedanger of being obsessed by his beliefs, which are meant to be tempo-rary expedients, and they become a ‘religion’ or ‘god’ to him. SimilarlyArt can degenerate into a process of observing what the public wantsand following the logical conclusion (ie a Scientific method); andScience (particularly in the hands of the marketing professional) candegenerate into ‘High Art’, either pursued for its own sake or elseused to decorate our conversation and justify our whims.However the ‘progress’ issue is less relevant here. What matters isthat the theories of Magic and Religion are ‘perfect’, that is to saythey belong to what was called the ‘Spiritual World’, and so arebeyond language. This means that true Magical theories are verysimple, very abstract and universal in their scope.It also means that they are practically useless, for how can youapply a theory which cannot even be put into words? The answer isthat you must find a verbal representation (as was described inChapter Five) which can be applied. It is the mistake of assumingthat such representations are the whole theory which leads us intowrong ideas about Magic.Magicians themselves compound the error when they ‘fall’ in theway described above, and start to worship their chosen beliefs: if youmeet someone who insists that flying saucers really come from theobjective out-there planet Venus, then you cannot call him a Magicalthinker. Indeed such people often share all the narrowness of visionof the Scientist despite a few gaps in the logical linkage and wouldbetter be called pseudo-Scientists. His theory is vulnerable to attackby Science, but only insofar as it falls short of being a Magical theory.For any theory which is capable of definite Scientific disproof isnot an example of Magical theory. A survey of Venus could determinewhether material flying saucers came from there; this is not a Magicaltheory. However ‘flying saucers are messengers from a higher intelli-gence’ could almost form part of a Magical theory because there areno clauses about objectivity: the ‘higher intelligence’ could be withinone’s own brain, or it could be a sociological or universal gestalt. Butit is not a very good example of Magic theory because it is too limitedin scope, merely devised to emphasise a comparison.A better example is the theory of the four elements Earth, Air,Fire and Water: a theory which survives untouched by the irrelevant -     previous ages. Or is it another symptom of the mistaken belief thatScience can wage war on other ways of thought?To the Magician Love is incapable of being reduced. I deliberatelywrite the word with a capital because I am assuming its full signifi-cance as a representation of something in the Spiritual World, so howcan it be reduced? The Alchemists, for example, were forever equat-ing Love to chemical reactions, but they never kidded themselves thatthey had reduced Love in the process. On the contrary, the equationcould be better said to elevate chemical reactions, revealing in them arepresentation of that indescribable Spiritual idea. Aleister Crowleywas just one example of a Magician who would be relieved when theturgid psychoanalytical theories of Love give way to a chemicalrevival.What then makes us wrongly believe in the defeat of Magicaltheory? It is a lack of understanding of the nature of such theory.Magical and Religious theory is ‘perfect’, that of Art and Scienceis ‘imperfect’. Scientific and Religious theory is ‘progressive’ whereasthe Artistic and Magical is not.The imperfection of Scientific and Artistic theory means that it isforever changing: Science, being progressive, makes advances whilstArt theory goes round in cycles. The perfection of Magical andReligious theory makes them immune from that sort of change, yetonly Magic is completely static. Religion has a sense of progress akinto that of Science but more like a ripening process than the revolu-tion of Science.The progressive parameter is open to argument: some would saythat Religious theory makes no more progress than does Magic. Butprovided I am careful to distinguish between the actual theories, andthe spirituality of their followers, I still feel that I can detect progressin Religious ideas — for example the evolution towards monotheism.Others will point out that Science has cycles of fashion as much asdoes Art: you cannot debate with a nutritionist without first askingwhether it is protein, carbohydrate or vitamins that are ‘in’ thisseason. But here again I would prefer to distinguish between, as itwere, Science and science.

To such theorists all Science cando is to erode certain over-precise representations of a Magicaltheory: a sad process it is true, but it does help one to transcend inad-equate models.Possibly the best way to explain how this works in practice is togive an example in a little more detail, but in so doing I must askmore hostile readers to be patient. As should be clear by now, it isimpossible to discuss a Magical theory without first ‘freezing’ it to asingle, less adequate, interpretation, and it is of course even moreimpossible to condense the full reasoning behind any one exampleinto such a short essay.One day Johnstone was describing to his friends the Magicaltheory of the Universal Mind: usually expressed in terms ofMicrocosm and Macrocosm, there is a common Magical idea thatmind, or consciousness in some form, extends throughout theuniverse.Johnstone explained how this idea had survived despite changingbeliefs. When electrical forces were felt to be the explanation of allphenomenon, the Universal Mind was seen as an all-pervading tideof ‘etheric forces’. At another time it was seen as an effect of vibra-tion, a sort of ‘music of the spheres’. When the ‘fourth dimension’captured our attention, then the obvious place for the Universal Mindwas in another dimension. Thus it is that Magicians have always feltfree to say that a flower turns towards the Sun because it ‘wants to’.But one of the audience took exception to this last point sayingthat it was ridiculous now to say that a flower can ‘want’ when it hasno brain or nervous system: it faces the Sun because the sunny side ofthe stalk grows more slowly and so curls the flower in that direction,a mechanical process free from notions of desire. All Johnstone’sexamples were set in past ages when the Scientific vision was stillincomplete, Only now did we know enough to have totally excludedthe concept of ‘purpose’ from natural phenomena.The process had been a gradual one: when Newton initiated grav-itational theory, he eliminated the belief that objects ‘want’ to falltogether. So Physics and then Chemistry were the first to be purgedof the idea of ‘purpose’ or ‘desire’, everywhere replaced by a simplemechanistic principle. Next was Biology, when the idea of an ‘aim’ or -     discovery of over one hundred chemical elements, a theory which hasphysical, sociological, psychological, in fact universal implications. Icannot explain exactly what the theory means; I can only draw atten-tion to other representations. It can be seen as an observation aboutfour states of matter (solid, liquid, gas and plasma), as a plan ofpsychological types (as in the system of Jung) or as a key to the divi-sions of the Zodiac. Myself I have experienced it in forms moresubtle than any of those representations. For in place of ‘proof of ’ aMagical theory, we have ‘experience of ’ it. And in place of ‘knowledgeof ’ it, we have a ‘feeling for’ it. It would be unremarkable to find thatan un-westernised Polynesian had been aware of the idea of the fourelements all his life without ever having heard of the theory, whereasit would be sensational to find that he had sophisticated opinionsabout general relativity without ever having heard of Einstein’s work.The four elements theory is a truly Magical one, being verysimple (stemming from a division of all phenomena into four cate-gories which stand in a certain relation to each other), quite univer-sal and utterly perfect. If asked to explain it further, I would eithersuccumb to a natural twentieth century love of verbiage, or else havethe wisdom to present Magical theory in a Magical way — saying “goaway and observe Earth, Air, Fire and Water for a year”.Aleister Crowley gives a number of such Magical theories inMagick In Theory And Practice — he calls them formulae, as in ‘theformula of tetragrammaton’.So Magical theory lies beyond the reach of Scientific theory, but doesthis mean that it also lies beyond the reach of those of us who feelsurrounded by Scientific theory?The chapter started with a reference to the frustrated Magicianwho feels uncomfortable in a Scientific world: if such a person hashad the usual Scientific upbringing, he will perhaps bless me for mygood intentions, but ask “is it not too late, now that Science has soaltered the world that there is no longer any room for Magic orReligion?”To such people I can confidently assert that, provided the Magicalway of thought is natural to you, then the seeds of Magical theory cantake root in whatever world Science is capable of putting around you.Less charmingly, the finite processes of Scientific method are not -     - \u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0002\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0002\u0003\u0004\u0005\u0005\u0006\u0007\b\t\u0004\u0002\u0004\u000b\u0002\f\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u0002\u0010\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u0002\u0013\u0002\u0014\u0015\u0006\u0002\u0016\u0017\u0004\b\u0006\u000e\t\u0007\u0002\u0018\t\u0019\u000e\r\u000e\u001a\u0002\u0013\u0002\u001b\u001b\u001b\u001c\u0017\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u001d\u001e\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u001c\u0007\u0004\u001e\u0002"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"increasing complexity, with no qualitative gulf, then surely it isequally true to deduce that the rudiments of our own thought exist inthe simplest computer as it was to deduce that our own thought cancontain nothing which transcends the working of such a computer?So once the Magician has satisfied himself by observation thatpurpose exists in his mind, and the Scientist has informed him thathis mind is only quantitatively superior to that of an IBM computer,then surely he cannot deny the elements of purpose to the IBM with-out placing a qualitative gap somewhere along the line of evolutionbetween it and our brains?So the fact that I can distinguish purpose in my own thinkingmeans that I can grant the rudiments of that quality to thoughts ofany computer once I have accepted the claim that my mind is aphenomenon which would be duplicated by any electrical, fluidic ormechanical linkage which matched the pattern of the network of cellsin my brain structure.But surely everything in Nature is a computer? Any network,from a tangle of wires to a flow of traffic along intercommunicatingroads, can be seen as a logic machine or simple computer. Even asingle free particle in space is a computer because: a) any change inits motion illustrates a computation of the resultant of the forcesacting upon it; and b) according to another of Newton’s laws, itscontinued motion serves as a ‘memory’ of the resultant of the previ-ous forces which have acted upon it.It is pardonable therefore to see the quality of mind everywhere innature, especially as a larger computer is formed when any two ormore simpler computers interact with one another (a field of grass, aturbulent waterfall or a wood, is a very complex computer, indeed, toocomplex to be fully modelled by even our most sophisticated comput-ers to date). If ‘mind’ is the unavoidable by-product of such interact-ing systems, then all of Nature is a mind, all of mankind forms amind, the whole universe is a mind. If mind is no more than a patternof information interaction, then mind has existed long before thecreation of this world.Reincarnation demands no more than the possibility of thepattern which forms my personality being approximated to in laterbrains, or other larger patterns. Although the large number ofelements in any such pattern might make the possibility of its dupli- -     higher purpose was eliminated from the theory of evolution, and nowat last in Psychology the Behaviourists have shown that we do noteven need the idea of ‘will’ or ‘purpose’ when considering manhimself.Now it is known that even thought has a mechanistic explanation.Thought is the working of a very complex computer, ie the brain, soany human mind and the sum total of its dreams, experiences andimpressions could be duplicated as long as the structure of its patternof cells was accurately modelled in a sufficiently complicatedcomputer. Even those thought processes which we still believe to beuniquely human will become noticeable, or reproducible, as ourcomputers grow more intricate. For along the line of progressionbetween the simplest computer and the most ingenious and creativebrain, there is no qualitative gulf, only a gradation of complexity.Therefore ‘purpose’,‘will’ and ‘desire’ are meaningless fossilconcepts, as are the ‘spirit’, ‘inspiration’ or ‘creativity’. How then couldJohnstone still believe in Magic, and in particular in his ‘UniversalMind’?First Johnstone pointed out that it would be unreasonable toexpect him to answer on the spot, because that would force him toreproduce in a moment what could only in practice be an evolutionof belief. So it was after tea before he replied.As soon as he began to talk about ‘purpose’, he was interruptedand asked what precisely he meant by the word. He retorted, some-what irritated, that he did not see how his friend could claim to haveeliminated purpose if he did not know what it meant in the firstplace, that any normal human knew the meaning of the word fromhis own experience, and that all his friend had demonstrated was theunfortunate necessity for the human brain to first reduce itself tomechanical idiocy as preparation for the Scientific method.The rest of Johnstone’s argument should by now be obvious: theScientist sees no purpose in mechanism, and so according to presenttheory deduces no purpose in his brain; the Magician detects purposein his own thinking, and so according to the same theory deducespurpose in mechanism.If we are happy to note phenomena called ‘purpose’ and ‘desire’ inour own brains, and we are reliably informed that the progressionfrom the simplest computer to our brain is simply a progression of -     - "},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"people whether the theory is ‘really true’ or if they ‘really believe’ in itbecause we can see how they are in the process of making it true. Theadaptability of the human mind is such that we can just as gracefullyimitate the workings of a computer nowadays, as we were able tobehave like fallen gods in the past.But to a Magician it is a complete waste of time to wonder if thetheory is really true, Probably even before this book finds a publisher,someone will have devised a new theory of consciousness and thisargument will already be out of date. But who cares?And if some people see the example as mere verbal trickery,pointing out that it “has failed to prove that there exists an external,objective force of ‘purpose’ which guides Nature”, then they shouldlook back to the devil theory of Chapter Four. Whoever first askedwhether purpose could be external and objective? It was not theMagicians.Why is it necessary to emphasise that the Magician should not worryabout trying to prove his theories are true by other people’s standards?It is easy to laugh at a crank Magician who has become obsessedby one of his theories, without understanding how strong have beenthe temptations leading up to that obsession.The Magician starts by considering representations of sometheory in the light of his own experience until he forms an idea of, orfeel for, the theory behind the representations. Then he decides uponhis own version of the theory, which may or may not be an originalinterpretation, and studies how it applies to some practical purpose.Lemuel Johnstone had a feel for the theory of the four elements.He also had a desire to explain his attitude towards Magic to unsym-pathetic friends. Accordingly he devised his theory of four ways ofthought, based of course on the four elements. But he only used it forthat purpose as he took steps to save himself from obsession.Unless you have some form of defence — whether it is cynicismor magic circles — there is a tendency for your idea to begin to accu-mulate evidence. (Presumably this is because ‘evidence’ is what webelieve in today; in the past the temptation might instead have beena ‘sense of righteousness’.) You find that more and more facts beginto fit, and what started as a mere working tool is beginning to looklike the Key to the Universe. Of course there is also the temptation -     cation seem statistically infinitesimal, the likelihood is greatlyincreased when one realises firstly that any one brain is complexenough to ‘contain’ an arbitrarily large number of personalities (this ismost obviously seen in some cases of madness, but also in the case ofa novelist who lives his characters), and secondly that personality isnot an exact quantity (for I am a very different person in the earlymorning than I was the night before, but I consider both to be me.)Thus it is that Austin Spare could unearth experience of animalincarnation, by exploring his unconscious, for does not our brainshare its ancestry with theirs? To the Magician consciousness is muchmore of an absolute than the objective reality of the Scientist. Sowhen by suitable mental exercise and years of practice he finds thathe can ‘remember’ when the pattern of his own mind was for a fewbrief aeons being reproduced in the swirlings of interstellar dust, hehas little time for the Scientist’s question “but you can’t prove that youreally were Napoleon, can you?”It is only necessary to outline the idea as above; once the way ofthinking is indicated the arguments are obvious. And yet it is all justa game — showing how the Universal Mind reappears in a computertheory. It is no better than calling the Universal Mind a ‘higher vibra-tion’: in fact experience may show that the latter term will remain themore useful to Magicians.Do I really believe in this computer theory? The question is asymptom of Scientific education: ‘really’ and ‘believe’ are not wordswhich go happily together in Magical thought. I suppose that thereare many Scientists who ‘really believe’ in a computer theory of themind simply because it is possible to witness their projection of thatbelief. As Johnstone noted, such theorists often adopt an intellectualapproach of “I don’t know what you mean by ‘purpose’, ‘art’ or ‘inspi-ration’ and therefore I cannot talk about them.” In other words theydo reduce themselves to something less than a human (for fewhumans have qualms about such words). Similarly we note how the‘computer world’, ie the academics, technicians and businessmenconcerned with computers, does appear to adopt the characteristics ofa computer world: their published papers show the influence ofcomputer language being notable for their large number of nouns —often of a formal type with standard endings like ‘-ation’ and ‘-ology’,and very limited choice of verbs.

You know it,and so would anyone else who heard your story. But not if the storywas considered in a Scientific context, for in those terms there havebeen millions of happenings, and it is far from clear why the mindshould choose to claim that there were only three.What might have appeared to be a precise and logically verifiablestatement is in fact inextricably bound up with the subjective ideas ofimportance of events.The conclusion to be drawn from this chapter is that it is often amistake to bring one’s full powers of analysis to bear upon the wordsof a Magical theorist. Very likely his use of words has an individualbias, and so it is necessary to make an effort to see what simple prin-ciple lies behind his utterance. Once the principle is sensed, it shouldbe tested in one’s own experience before being accepted. Then it maybe necessary to form from it your own imperfect version which mayresemble that of the aforementioned Magician, or may appear quitedifferent.All this may seem terribly hard work compared with the directacceptance of Scientific theory at face value, but it should be remem-bered that in Science it is likely that the hard work has already beendone, for it is necessary to have the appropriate training in order tofully understand a Scientific theory in the first place. (Actually, Ithink I have improved upon this in the present edition because Iexplained in Chapter 3A that the value of a Magical theory lies notin its falsifiability but in the ability of the Magician to believe it.)Once one has become accustomed to the nature of Magicaltheory, it will be found that the theories are quite independent of your -     of personal pride at this point, especially when you start to collectdisciples — for the beginnings of obsession bestow great personalmagnetism. In his autobiography, Jung describes such a process oftemptation when coincidences seemed to add up to a suggestion thathe had a Great Message for Mankind. In his case, it was a Scientificbackground that saved him: he could not believe such a thing possi-ble, so he survived and his life’s work was the better for it.In the case of the Magician, the ultimate defence is to rememberthat any version of a theory which lies within your comprehension,and in particular one that can be expressed in words, is necessarily notthe whole truth. So however well it fits the facts — indeed especiallyif it fits too many facts — it is necessary to grow out of the theoryonce it is no longer needed. This is exactly analogous to the ‘licenseto depart’ in Ritual Magic: when a spirit has been evoked for somepurpose, then it is necessary to disperse it again. Failure to do sowould be likely to result in obsession.This is why Magical writing often piles on the self contradictoryparadoxes, for example the chapter called “Onion Peelings” inAleister Crowley’s “Book of Lies”. It also explains why the Magiciansthat hit the headlines can give such a poor impression of Magicaldoctrine, for it is the falling stars that make the most amusing pressstories.Finally I should add an example to illustrate what may well be obvi-ous by now: that the very qualities which make a Magic theory invul-nerable to Scientific attack also make sure that the theory is of no usein Scientific work, indeed it is usually meaningless in Scientific eyes.It has been a bad day: your shoe lace broke on the way to theoffice, you missed the bus and were late. So you sit at your desk andsigh: “Oh dear, what next? Things always happen in threes.”‘Things always happen in threes’ is a representation of a Magicaltheory, a weak one it is true because very incomplete.

Thus he sought to reinstateanimism which is such a useful Magical theory. Unfortunately, however — assuggested in my later essays — our culture’s long rejection of animism hasmade it hard for Western society to accept his idea of artificial intelligence inthe first place. We find it hard to accept the idea that a computer could everbe self conscious and possess a ‘soul’, whereas in Far Eastern cultures — withtheir more recent animistic traditions — a computer could have a soul just aseasily as a car, a rock or a stream could.This gives rise to a circular argument, something that is anathema inScience but quite acceptable in Magic. Circular arguments are fine for Magicbecause Magic is more concerned with changing perceptions than ultimatetruth. A circular argument can be used like a grindstone, not to ‘prove’ butrather to erode resistance to an ideaLet us begin with someone who cannot accept Johnstone’s cyber-animism because he is, for example, a New Ager who resists the idea of arti-ficial intelligence. I then apply the above argument “if a quartz crystal, a treeor a spring might contain a deva, might not there be one resident in a verycomplex computer?” Nothing has been proved, it has just become slightly‘easier to accept’. I then suggest “if that dance of data within silicon couldinvoke an intelligence, might not similar dances of data throughout natureinvoke a whole angelic hierarchy of devas analogous to the hierarchy ofroutines within an operating system?” I then suggest that “if our entire phys-ical universe is thus permeated by such a field of consciousness, surely youcannot deny some element of that awareness to a computer created withinit?” and so on. At no stage is artificial intelligence ‘proved’ but rather it ismade to ‘feel nicer’.For a serious Magical act, however, there should be some benefit orpurpose. I have long justified cyber-animism as a useful alternative toconspiracy theories, because it allows us to ascribe ‘spirit’ to systems. I recalla rationalist long ago attacking my thesis by saying “there is no such entity as‘Science’, there are only scientists”.

I also wished to spread thesebenefits to a wider public in my writings, but have learnt a practical lessoninstead. I have discovered that conspiracy theories can be better friends thanMagical solutions because they attract better media coverage and so greaterwealth. That is why I have decided to write no more on the subject.VIRTUAL REALITYInstead I say a little more now about the ancient and widespread Magicaltheory that matter is an illusion or, to put it in more modern terms, that ourreality is ‘virtual’.As explained earlier, Magical beliefs are chosen to support a desired endresult. If you want advice and you have a tarot pack, you adopt some form ofbelief that a tarot pack contains or else is a doorway to greater wisdom, andthen you draw the cards.So it is desirable to select beliefs which offer greater scope for Magicalresults. The belief that our world is but a shadow play of mighty cosmicforces, which can be wooed and manipulated by human wisdom — that is apretty good Magical belief. The belief that the world was made by one Godwho forbids the use of Magic is a less useful one. One of the worst possibleMagical beliefs is that our world is made of solid matter shaped only bychance, within which human consciousness and will arise as mere epiphe-nomena. Magic-wise it’s utter useless crap, and yet it is a belief heavilyendorsed by our Scientific culture. So what is needed for modern Magic is abelief which will subvert Scientific materialism and restore the unreality ofmatter.The candidate that Lemuel Johnstone put forward was the notion thatwe are living in a cybernetic virtual reality which has the laws of physicsprogrammed (or learnt or evolved) into it. The strength of this magical beliefis that it does not attempt to oppose the materialistic model so much as totranscend it. This was originally explained in the following terms.1)If reality is ultimately materialistic and rational, then it could be describedin a finite set of instructions and modelled as information.2)If it could be modelled in this way, then it will be — at the very leastbecause, given limitless time, all possible permutations of a finite universeshould occur.3)For every one original reality there will be many such sub-models, and theytoo will generate many sub-sub-models.4)The nature of complex systems means that it is almost impossible for anyreality to reproduce itself exactly, indeed there is greater likelihood that - -,     as Art, Magic and Religion) not as an entity but as an inclination in thisessay, nevertheless I have felt free to talk about it in familiar terms as an entitywhich can evolve and compete like a living being in the ecology of humanculture. That is to say I can address it as a spirit with rudimentary survivalintelligence which is related to its human practitioners but also distinct fromthem. So, for example, when Science produces discoveries which threatenhuman existence, I need not assume that there must be an evil Scientist whowishes to destroy us, but I can rather explore the survival value of a way ofthought which both poses threats and promises solutions.Conspiracy theories are surely another example of decadent Scientificthinking: “for any phenomenon there must be a cause and, as Science deniesthe agency of spirit, then evil can only be a product of human malevolence”.So when (in defiance of all that is known about placebos, human suggestibil-ity under stress and the mind-body link) the medical profession encourageslegislation to replace healthy outdoor images on cigarette packets with warn-ings of death — I do not assume an evil clique of doctors who are seeking todestroy our health, but rather I recognise the survival intelligence of the‘spirit’ we call ‘the medical profession’ in generating new threats to health tokeep pace with the cures with which it buys human attention and devotion.A more recent example. Late twentieth century economic success hasbeen uneven — the rich getting richer and the poor poorer. When I hear a‘fat cat’ from a privatised utility justifying his bloated wealth with thesentence “but it’s a free market”, I feel angry and wish to take his kind on aConcorde trip across the Atlantic and, halfway across, announce “good news,everybody, we are now in a free aeroplane! I’ve just killed the pilot!”.However, I can reduce this burden of anger more effectively by realising thatit need not be individual greed but rather the nature of Money that is at fault.In our business culture it is those who have the most wealth (eg the board ofdirectors) who decide how future money should be distributed. No matterhow well-intentioned and fair minded the individuals concerned, this is amechanism which is biassed towards the aggregation rather than the spreadof fortunes. Money, as we have allowed it to evolve, has become a herd-animal and I do not happen to be at a place where it has herded (perhaps Ishould sacrifice a goat to it!).Thus a Magical theory of pantheism, a world peopled with spirits, isreally a practical version of a theory of systems which recognises autonomy inprocesses. It would have helped the libertarian movement in Thatcher’sgovernment to realise that you do not necessarily further the freedom of theindividual by giving greater freedom to systems such as industry, commerceand finance.This approach was justified for its usefulness. It has been useful to me inproviding understanding and replacing suspicion and anger with more useful -     - "},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"stration of the reality of God by a Religious person — eg how could sucha complex and well-ordered world exist without a creator? — Scienceresponds with an alternative non-deistic explanation — eg the theory oforder emerging from random complexity.So ‘God is not necessary’ does not need ‘God is necessary’ to counter it.‘God is more likely’ will be sufficient.2)Next we avoid the temptation to look for bigger, better weapons ofcounter-argument. Instead we simply borrow the same weapon andreturn fire. The psychological advantage (remember, we are workingwithin the Magician’s psyche) is this: the return fire either hits home orelse, if it does not, then it casts doubt on the validity of the original argu-ment.Thus we argue that the material world is not necessary, using the sameargument as above: any aspect of material reality which the Scientist candemonstrate to me can be reproduced as information. The Scientificexplanation is only valid insofar as it is precise — and that is the precisequality needed to render it exactly into information. Therefore I do notneed the existence of material reality, I believe only in virtual reality.3)Now today’s Magician quite likely accepts the idea that complex order canevolve out of chaos, so we cannot use the nineteenth century Religious‘watchmaker’ argument at this stage — the one which says ‘if this is avirtual reality then someone must have programmed it’. Instead weexplore the modern notion and use it as a metaphor.The most complex emergent manifestation in modern mythology is that,from a random chemical soup, there emerged self replicating formswhich in turn evolved living cells which in turn evolved complex livingstructures which in turn evolved consciousness.So we explore this analogy. We conceive instead a random informationsoup. In place of competition for chemicals or territory we conceivecompetition for processing power or memory, and see how recurringcalculations such as infinite series could evolve in analogy to crystalstructures, and how these would gain advantage in an information soup.We also conceive that programs with more flexible internal structurescould also evolve and replicate (in analogy with viruses) and have evengreater competitive advantage. And there would be further advantage inthose programs which aggregate into complex information structureswhich model their own inner universes, because they would be self moti-vating like living organisms. So a virtual reality like our universe could bejust one of many similar or diverse universes that have evolved within theinformation soup, and it owes its survival to having evolved a set of ‘phys-ical’ laws and constants which is consistent with a stable and competitive - -,     the submodels will be mutations of the original, subject to differentstructures and laws.5)Because the models severely outnumber the original reality, or realities, itis therefore more likely that we are living in a universe modelled as infor-mation, and it is most likely that it is not identical to the original reality.6)Thus Johnstone’s Paradox:if reality is ultimately materialistic and rational,then it is highly unlikely we are living in a materialistic, rational universe.His ideas, like his universes, spawned their own variations. One, championedin Words Made Flesh, is that it does not matter whether reality is ultimatelymaterial, energetic or information-based, all that matters is what we believeit to be, and information will become the most likely candidate. Anotherversion described in later essays, like my “Response to Shadows of Mind”, isthat the universe does not actually have magic programmed into it but, likeany software, it has bugs which sometimes allow miraculous or paranormalphenomena. In this version the software of the universe is self-debugging andthat consciousness has a key role in this process — if you witness a paranor-mal event, the more you seek to capitalise upon it by calling in witnesses orscientific researchers, the less likely it is to be repeatable, because suchconscious attention is a trigger to the de-bugging mechanism. Note that,because Johnstone’s model places consciousness not within the algorithms ofartificial intelligence, but rather within the relationship between those algo-rithms and the containing universe of information, Penrose’s Godel-basedcounter-argument has no relevance here.The object of presenting this information model of reality is that it is auseful basis for Magical belief. The above mentioned books spell out how theargument can be used to justify any paranormal or magical principle you wish— from reincarnation to tea-cup fortune-telling — so I will give only oneexample here of the technique. Let us go for a biggy and ‘prove that Godexists’.DOES GOD EXIST?Let us assume an apprentice Magician who is attracted to Paganism and sowants to believe in a Great Spirit or Great Mother or whatever of theuniverse, but has difficulty because of his Scientific education. As far as he isconcerned Science has ‘disproved God’, so how can he get over this hurdle?1)We begin by testing the strength of Scientific disproof, to give us a meas-ure of the required strength of the new belief.What we discover is that Science has not delivered strict proof of God’snon-existence, so much as to make him unnecessary.

After the second searing blast my friendturns to the tester and affirms that she definitely liked the first blast better.I was amused by her use of the word “energy”, but that doesn’t mean I rejectedit. I understood perfectly clearly (if not precisely) what she meant by her words —and communication is the main job of language. She had used the word “energy” inwhat I would describe as a magical rather than a scientific way.The statement “this car has a turbocharged engine” conveys precise technicalinformation. But when the word “turbo” is written in big letters across the back ofa car it conveys a whole lot of additional information about style and image — theword has become, say, 40% scientific information and 60% magic. But when“Turbo” is written large on a bottle of aftershave, it becomes 100% magic. Somepeople would insist that the word had lost all meaning — but that is hard on thecosmetics company which probably spent thousands of pounds on that trademark.A word does not need to have meaning in order to convey meaning. I can shout“fascist” at a power hungry politician even if he is a member of the Labour party.The poet Gerald Manley Hopkins can write of “betweenpie mountains” and“wimpling wings” and get away with it.To me scientific language is the use of words for the meaning they have, whilemagical language is the use of words for the meaning they convey as metaphor.Science is itself a good source of these magical metaphors. In the early nineteenthcentury magnetism caught the public imagination and a whole raft of magicaltheories of “animal magnetism” and “magnetic passes” were floated. Then sciencepostulated an ether and spiritualists took up the idea of “vibrations” and “etheric”fields and forces. This century brought the idea of a fourth dimension, adding“dimension” to the magical vocabulary. Now we have a spate of literature whichweaves magical theories on the basis of quantum terminology.If you insist on the original scientific meaning of these words, the result can behighly amusing. To the cynic it looks as if science has moved on and left a bunch ofcranks trying to justify themselves in terms of outmoded terminology: sensitiveswittering about “etheric vibrations” at a time when the ether concept was no longerrecognised by science; talk of “higher” dimensions without any explanation of how - -,     universe — just as the internal structure of the higher animals can beshown to have evolved by enhancing their survival.In the biochemical model, however, the most complex organisms haveevolved consciousness, which presumably must have some survivaladvantage. It is not unlikely, therefore, that the most complex universesin our information soup will also be conscious, as it would give themsimilar survival advantage. So it is quite natural to assume that ouruniverse is a conscious entity, and that its mind is what we call GreatSpirit or whatever.4)To summarise: the Disbeliever and the Magician can now be conceived astwo blood cells within my body. The Disbeliever is claiming “I haveflowed all over Ramsey Dukes from head to toe and have not witnesseda single cellular process which cannot be explained in terms of simplechemical or electrical reactions. I do not believe this body is consciousbecause I do not need it to be.” Whereas the Magician states “I too haveexplored him from head to toe and do not see why such a complex struc-ture would have evolved without having also evolved a measure ofconsciousness. I therefore find it easier to believe that Ramsey Dukes isconscious.”As suggested, it is no more a strict proof of God’s existence than was theoriginal a proof of non-existence. It has simply tipped the scales of likelihoodto make it easier for the Magician to choose the desired belief which is, inthis example, that Nature is a conscious spirit or god.This suggested model of God is only appropriate to such nature-reli-gions. Of course the argument would need to be refined for those Judeo-Christian sects which demand of deity a long beard and white robe.PSEUDO-SCIENTIFIC JARGONI’m in a bit of a dilemma as to whether to include some more words aboutthe way that Magic can pilfer Scientific terminology to deliver functionalMagical metaphors. On the one hand I feel it is an irritation which canusefully be salved, on the other hand I fear that I may be spoiling a lot of fun.It is so delicious listening to Scientists fuming over New Age or theo-sophical pseudo-scientific jargon, that I really do not wish to deprive futureMagicians of this pleasure. My own favourite phrase in face of pompousScientific dogmatism about, say, lack of hard evidence for the benefits ofvegetarianism is “but, of course, [insert topic of discussion] are known to vibrateat an altogether higher dimension”. Note especially the brutal ‘of course’ soexquisitely juxtaposed with the rapier-like incoherence of vibrating ‘at’ adimension. -     - "},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"CHAP TER EIGHTSecrecyWhen the system of patents was first devised, the idea was not thatit should provide a means of keeping other people from using aninventor’s ideas, but rather as the word ‘patent’ suggests, that it shouldencourage inventors to make the ideas accessible for the inspirationof others. This institution might well be seen as the turning pointwhen technology banished the influence of Magic and became theplayground. of Science. For secrecy is as useful to Magic as it is incon-venient to Science.Secrecy in Magic is not just a ploy to irritate Scientists. It is animportant part of method. But its importance is so much a matter ofexperience that it is almost impossible to explain the importance tothose who lack that experience; it will therefore only be consideredbriefly.In Chapter Three, reference was made to Science’s body ofaccepted truth. As Science only works outward from that knowledge,it is naturally important that its full extent should be available to theScientist. The total is too large ever to be needed by one researcher,but every part must be available in case it is needed. Not only does itslow down Science’s progress if certain areas are secret and have to beseparately reconstructed by other researchers, but also when wrongconclusions are drawn through suppression of the necessary experi-mental evidence, then the effect is positively harmful to Science.This means that secrecy is so undesirable in Science thatScientists are liable to be extremely scathing about Magical systemswhere secrecy has its place.Firstly it must be remembered that Magic does not require a bodyof accepted objective knowledge, and so the virtues of free expression,so obvious in Science, are considerably reduced in the case of Magic.Secondly, however, it must be realised that secrecy can make apositive contribution to Magical method. Though sometimes forgot-ten by modern Magicians, an old axiom of the Hermeticists requiredthat their initiates should ‘know, will, dare and keep silent’.Astrology is perhaps the branch of Magic closest to the Sciences.An astrological conference seems therefore to be very much like aa dimension can be “high”; the phrase “negative energies” when energy is normallyrecognised as a scalar quantity.But if you admit the metaphorical use of these words the result is much moreinformative.Barbara Brennan’s interview in this Caduceus is titled “the Four Dimensions,AIDS and Sound ”. It is clear that Barbara’s dimensions are not those of Einsteinwhen she describes the first dimension as “the physical”.Meanwhile in this issue we have Atum O’Kane describing four kinds ofmagnetism which I would defy the most sensitive of magnetometers to register.Notice too that he writes “...the dimension of energy or magnetism...”This issue of Caduceus, like the last, focusses on the theme of “energy”, yet itclearly covers subjects way beyond the remit of the Minister for Energy.When my friend said she preferred the energy of wood, she meant that she feltbetter with it than with metal. This sounds more like an information than anenergy exchange — a point made here by David Spangler in his article “Makingthe Energies Work For You”. Dr Taylor referred, in Caduceus 21, to the idea of a“scalar field ” which carries information but not force — this too sounds much morelike the sort of “energy” described in these pages.“What exactly is this energy?” is an interesting question.

This is thepoint where my explanation falters and only experience can help.There seems to be a link between free communication and leaki-ness in Magic. Although this is very clear in some theoretical frame-works (eg exposing your plans is a dispersal of ‘etheric potential’), itis also an almost universal factor in Magical systems. I cannot thinkof one where complete lack of secrecy is desirable.What do I mean by the need for experience? Simply this: practicesome regular Magical ritual or meditation beyond the point whereyou are still under the influence of its novelty, and then study thedifference in its effectiveness between: a) a period when you practiceon your own in complete secrecy; and b) one when you let everyoneknow of your practices, what you are doing, when and why. Thedifference will probably help you to understand the importance ofsecrecy in Magic.Of course the idea mentioned in Chapter 7A, that we are livingin a self-debugging virtual universe, provides a model for this.Drawing too much conscious attention to paranormal experienceevokes the debugging software to normalise it. Surprise is a commod-ity that does not stretch very far, and that is the tragedy of the media.Another aspect of secrecy comes in group work. For example, in asystem of initiation with several grades (as will be described in theChapter Nine), it is common for the syllabus of higher grades to bekept secret from those in lower grades. The reason for this is obviousin view of the above remarks: it avoids ‘leakiness’ and builds uppsychic tension. It is also desirable from a psychological point ofview: the air of mystery adds strength to the Magical framework of akind that would only hinder Scientific work.No further justification for secrecy will be given, because there is nomore I can give. But even that confession is helpful in an under- - Scientific conference: it is an open affair with lectures and discussionson all astrological topics, with a free passage of knowledge. However,it has an additional feature not expected in a true Science, for not onlyare there different branches of Astrology, but there are also differentschools. Here lies the difficulty, for all goes well in a lecture on adifferent school until actual contradictions of method are reached. Ofcourse, apart from Magical explanations of this, there are also simplepsychological explanations — after all, certain branches ofPsychology suffer from the rivalry of different schools — and so thereis no hard feeling. However, there will always be found someastrologers who come away from such an affair reeling under theimpact of several schools, and despairing of the total complexity.Whereas two separate branches of Science tend either to bemutually irrelevant, or else to add up to something even greater, thereis a tendency for two Magical systems to be mutually destructive.This is not always as dramatic as it sounds: in the case of theastrologers it simply means that when a member of one school comesinto contact with another he might find that he is temporarily aconfused and less positive astrologer.It was explained in Chapter Seven how the practical applicationof a Magical system requires a temporary effort of belief in it.Practical Scientific work requires a narrowing of the observation toessentials and an opening up to the full theoretical possibilities.Practical Magic work requires a narrowing of the theoretical possibil-ities but a wide open receptivity to observations. This is the pointwhere rival systems can be harmful.In this essay I described matter in terms of a condensation ofspirit or thought. If one was planning a Magical operation based onthat idea, it would only be confusing if one came across an interest-ing speaker from one of the Magical schools who see matter as thestarting point, and spirit as an effect produced by its patterns of inter-action. From an overall initiatory point of view this could be helpful;for Magical theory states that such apparently opposing ideas can beresolved at a ‘higher level’ (this sometimes happens in Science, egwhen a wave theory and a particle theory find resolution in a quan-tum theory). But the temporary loss of ‘feel’ is definitely a hindrancein a practical working. -     - "},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"CHAP TER 8AYar boo sucksExperienced and initiated Magicians will, of course, recognise one vital omis-sion from that brief discussion of Magical secrecy.I refer, of course, to that Great Arcanum whose origins are lost in thePrimal Mists of Aeons.

But fairness is irrelevant inthis context: all that is revealed is another distinction between Magicand Science.In Science the theories are imperfect, and are constantly beingrevised. In Magic, however, they are perfect and untouchable. On theother hand, in Science it is assumed that the operator (ie theScientist) is perfect whereas in Magic the operator is imperfect andhimself in need of improvement.These assumptions lead to the above difference in attitude in thefollowing way. Because Science assumes a perfect Scientist, it ignoresa result which stems from his own defects: as far as Science isconcerned, the man ceased temporarily to be a Scientist as heperformed the experiment, and so the result is irrelevant (the word‘Scientist’ is being used in a stricter sense here than elsewhere). Aperfect operator is assumed, and therefore needs no mention: thewrite-up of an experiment never refers to the absent-mindedness ofthe laboratory staff, or their tea breaks. But because Magic assumesan imperfect Magician, it accepts and so identifies with his errors: wesay that ‘the Magic has failed’ and perhaps overlook the fact that theMagician is part of that Magic.Here then is where the real excitement lies in Magic: it is in the possi-bility of the Magicians being able to work upon themselves andimprove themselves according to some chosen scale of values. Thiscan make Magic every bit as compelling and absorbing as is Sciencewith its possibility of working and improving upon our knowledge asexpressed in its theories. Indeed, as was mentioned earlier in mytheory of cycles, the person who is attracted to Magic in search ofpower or wordly effectiveness, will usually find themselves gravitat-ing towards a path of self improvement.The scale of values by which the Magician judges his progress willof course appear as a subjective one to the eyes of a Scientist. Itshould in fact be based upon some transcendent Spiritual aim, just asthe Magic theories should be.

But the danger of revealing just theskeleton of any subject is the danger of revealing a lifeless skeleton.One’s reaction to an account of Magic such as this could be “howvery intriguing, but I can’t see why people get so excited by it?”People do get excited by Science, don’t they? People have spentyears of their life in laboratories, denying hunger, poverty and theadvice of well-wishers, in order to make some Scientific discovery.And yet Science has been described in this essay in no less skeletal aform than Magic.The difference is that we have all some experience of Science, andthat experience has given us a feeling of the driving force behindScientific endeavour, that is to say the sense of progress.As was mentioned in the Chapter Seven, the theories of Scienceare progressive, and it is this sense of progress which raises Sciencefrom intellectual gymnastics to a way of life. But Magical theories arenot progressive in this way, so what can there be in Magic whichcould make it into a lifelong passion instead of just a funny way oflooking at things? This chapter will attempt to answer that question.If a Magical student attempts some operation to the best of hislimited ability and it fails, then it is normal to feel that his Magic hasfailed. One cannot be expected to meet all the conditions of a compli-cated Magical working: in this cissy socialist era the tongue of ahanged man can be hard to come by and it may be necessary to makedo by strangling a younger brother. But provided the intentions werecorrect, one still would feel that it was in a sense the Magic which hadfailed.In Scientific work the attitude is quite different.

So the initiation requires us to gainmastery over, or perfect, each element in turn.As it stands, however, these four grades add up to a system ofHatha Yoga which would contribute to a healthy body but would notprovide much emotional, intellectual or spiritual satisfaction. In factmost people would grow out of this purely physical (Earth) interpre-tation of the four elements, and realise the need to work also on theemotional needs (Water).Again we start with Earth: it is no good trying to perfect youremotional nature against a background of ill-health. Water corre-sponds to the need to achieve harmonious emotional relationshipswith others. On this level an ‘Air’ initiation would require skill atcommunication, and a ‘Fire’ initiation would involve coming to termswith one’s ambitions.This interpretation too has its limitations, so the whole cycle canbe reconsidered on an intellectual or ‘Air’ level. Perfecting the mindwould involve first mastering the body so that thought is not contin-uously interrupted by its process, and secondly the achievement ofemotional stability for the same reason. Thirdly there is pure intel-lectual exercise in order to clarify thought, and fourthly meditation inorder to determine the limitations of thought.I will not attempt to interpret the model in the Spiritual World.Thus the original simple four-stage example has extended in a‘wheels within wheels’ manner to a system of sixteen grades, eachrelying on the mastery of the one before it. Such a scale might provesatisfactory to an individual Magician because, although apparentlyeight grades have to be passed before there is any intellectual stimu-lus, in fact the very process of devising your own grades and exercisesas you proceed means that you are achieving on all levels at each step.But for a group it is better to provide grades where each stepinvolves some work on several levels in order to encourage themembers. Therefore the first, or Earth, grade despite being heavilybiased towards the physical would also involve the correspondingideas on other levels. The idea that the body should be mastered sothat it does not impede thought would thus be introduced straightaway, and appropriate meditation practices suggested.For a large group it is also desirable to have a much more formalsyllabus. As described so far, every step is just about impossible, ie -   and two fine children in a house in Hampstead’. A much more satis-factory idea would be that ‘perfection means independence from thelimitations of circumstances’, but even that definition would need tobe revised when death draws near.Given then that there is some subjectively-felt idea of perfection,and of movement in that direction, this aim can permeate and enlivenall systems of Magic. Even if your only Magical practice is divination,then you probably begin with the obvious desire to improve your skill.But because the idea of perfection must be transcendent it cannotstop there. With time you realise that the need to practice divinationreflects inadequacy upon your part, and so yet greater skill comes withless frequent use. This is very irritating to Scientific friends whodemand more proof of your ability as you progress; but the need toimpress such friends is itself a limitation which must be overcome.Although the sense of progress in Magic often exists as a less obviousand conscious compulsion — in which form it is likely to be over-looked by the newcomer to the subject — yet it is seen and under-stood most clearly when it is formalised in a system of Initiation. Insystems of Ritual Magic such as Witchcraft, initiation plays a veryimportant and obvious role to the extent that it dominates otherwork.For the purposes of devising a system of initiation, you need notonly a strong sense of the direction in which you wish to improve, butalso a Magical theory around which a system can crystallise. So let ustake the theory of the four elements as an example and devise asystem of initiation based upon it.How shall we represent the theory? Let us say that “each humanconsists of four elements, Earth, Air, Fire and Water, so to perfect thehuman we must perfect each of the four elements within.”But where do we begin? What do we actually do?The representation chosen is a good one: it is not one which islikely to prove a limitation, but it is too good to start with. So keep itin mind whilst choosing a temporary representation on a more mate-rial level.Earth is the flesh or substance of our body, Water is the blood andliquid secretions, Air is our breath and also the air taken in through -     - \u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0002\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0002\u0003\u0004\u0005\u0005\u0006\u0007\b\t\u0004\u0002\u0004\u000b\u0002\f\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u0002\u0010\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u0002\u0013\u0002\u0014\u0015\u0006\u0002\u0016\u0017\u0004\b\u0006\u000e\t\u0007\u0002\u0018\t\u0019\u000e\r\u000e\u001a\u0002\u0013\u0002\u001b\u001b\u001b\u001c\u0017\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u001d\u001e\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u001c\u0007\u0004\u001e\u0002"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"you because it is a small part of a jigsaw which has found its place.Using the previous analogy we have an infinite series of terms 1/2 +1/4 + 1/8 + . . each more trivial than the last and yet all adding uptowards a final unity.Even for a Magician it is not easy to grasp the final unity in theseearly stages, and thus it is that the year should culminate in adramatic ritual, to mark and complete the achievement. Of coursethis ritual should in an obvious way serve as an examination of theskills which are necessary for that grade, but it is much more thanthat. It is also a hotch potch of what might be called ‘mumbo jumbo’.Such a crazy concoction needs to be very carefully devised by peoplewho have a lot of experience and skill in this field because its make-up must involve all that infinitude of trivia which were too small evento have occurred to the aspirant in his year of study and yet which areneeded to complete the series. Thus it is that the ritual will containall the symbolism of the element Air, and quotations from mythologywhich may not be clearly understood even by those who have devisedthe ritual. This is a situation where an element of secrecy has its place— exact knowledge of your superior’s deficiencies is unhelpful at theearly stages! And thus it is that the ritual is not just an exam, but theclimax and completion of the year’s work.This also explains the curious use of the word ‘initiation’ for whatmight seem to be a process of ‘termination’. The year leading up tothe Air initiation is seen not as a year spent within the Air grade, butas a year of begging to be admitted to it. The initiation ceremony isthe point when the door is opened to you.The four grades above suggested correspond to the first tourgrades of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn which flourishedaround the end of the nineteenth century. This order set a standardwhich others have followed, so it is best to study the publishedversion of those rituals and corresponding syllabus for a morecomplete idea of what is involved. The Golden Dawn initiations runto a total of more than four grades because a larger scheme is used.What is more, it should be noted that later grades grow increasinglyless easy to master.The process of formalising the initiation for group working mightseem to defeat its original purpose: why set a time limit of a yearwhen different people might demand different times for different -   who can achieve complete mastery of the body in a lifetime, let alonedo so as the first of many grades? So in practice earlier grades will beless demanding. If a time is fixed for each grade, it is best to makesure that the span of time includes some complete cycle, preferably awhole year. This is because the problems of working with the elementFire, for example, are different in summer from what they are inmidwinter; at noon they are different from what they are at midnight.So a Fire grade which did not involve a whole year of practice wouldbe incomplete. Of course the problems also change from one year toanother — eg as we grow old — but that is too much to allow for, soit is best to compromise with one year.A course of initiatory grades is then set out, a year for Earth,another for Water, another for Air and another for Fire. At each stagethere is a lot of set work, but it is also assumed that the candidate willdevise his own additional objectives because this ensures that he hasa deeper understanding of the significance of his grade.At each stage work will be done on every level but will be biasedtowards just one of those levels. For example the third year is the Airgrade and will therefore be biased towards the intellect, involvingtaking classes in mathematics or whatever mental skills are mostwanting. But achievement in this grade would also demand skill atevery other aspect of the element Air. If you were a poor speaker, youwould need to study elocution, and how to clarify your thoughts fordebate. Certainly you would be expected to have obtained someproficiency at Yoga breathing exercises — and to have experiencedtheir effect on the thought processes. Similarly it is a good year forlong walks in mountain scenery, to see if the air there is as stimulat-ing to you as it has been to great thinkers in the past. You might evenjoin a gliding club — if the relevance of gliding to intellect is obscureto you, then all the more reason for trying it.Each example that comes to mind seems more and more tenuousin its relevance to an intellectual grade; this is an illustration of theanalogy in Chapter Three. During a year of effort and meditationupon the significance of the element Air, a myriad of tiny experiencesand achievements falls into place: when autumn comes you noticethat certain types of leaves fall directly and others spin and tumble,and you say ‘Ah, I see’.

The question of course is a Scientist’s. What many peopleforget is the fact that rose tinted glass does not superimpose a colourwhich does not exist in a scene, but rather it filters out all otherelements. So from a rosy point of view it presents what is arguably aclearer picture. As far as we are here concerned, there is no lie.The Magical theory being suggested is that the process ofmemory does not so much distort events, but rather stores them inthe form of purer essence — after all, whisky keeps better than beer.Any event as experienced is a pattern of interacting cells. In order topreserve it, we distil from it the simple elements of that pattern andrelate them to existing patterns in the brain. So when I recall an idleperiod of my youth spent in Mediterranean bars, although I canrightly argue that I was at the time bored, uncertain and disillusioned,I cannot help a glowing feeling that comes from an association of thatmemory with such archetypes as ‘the Englishman abroad’, ‘dissipatedyouth’ and no doubt other even more majestic symbols.

So we seek to improve ourselves by developing the ability towitness the magic of the present as it happens, and not merely whenit has become the distant past.

In what sense can one year of intellectual effort be comparedwith a ‘mastery of the intellect’?The answer is that group working requires a compromise, but thatevery precaution must be taken in trying to overcome the limitationsof that compromise. Already it has been suggested that the formalsyllabus should incorporate the student’s own ideas for additions tothat course. Many systems of initiation demand also that members ofeach grade have pupils in the grade beneath, and that initiation intothe next grade depends upon the successful initiation of your ownpupil. This helps to remind you that the achievement of a particulargrade does not give you the right to ignore its lessons in the future.The example of an initiation hierarchy was described at lengthbecause it represents Magical progress in its most obvious form, anda form which is of most interest to non-Magicians. Although thisformal scale of progress is only encountered in Ritual Magic, a simi-lar idea of increasing attainment is found in all systems.It is tempting to say that when the idea of progress is absent, thenit is not Magic but just the use of a Magical technique. But this is notaltogether true. For progress is not always a continuous process: astudent who takes up divination may spend a few years finding outabout it and picking up the skill, without any conscious idea of selfimprovement. However he is unlikely to remain in that state for ever,He may simply ‘grow out of ’ divination, or he may actually grow intoa more involving system of Magic. Even in the theory of Astrologythere is an idea of the twelve signs being a symbol of a man’s evolu-tion.It was suggested that my one example of an initiatory scheme failedto illustrate how diverse were the possibilities for a scheme ofprogress in Magic. So a very different example is here appended inorder to give some idea of the breadth of possibility. This exampleseems much closer to the idea of Religious mysticism, but there aredistinctions upon which I will not elaborate. It starts from the ideathat consciousness, and so ‘higher worlds’, arise from patterns devel-oped in matter (and so is at first glance inverse to the example schemeof Chapter Five where matter is seen as lumpy thinking). -     - \u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0002\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0002\u0003\u0004\u0005\u0005\u0006\u0007\b\t\u0004\u0002\u0004\u000b\u0002\f\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u0002\u0010\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u0002\u0013\u0002\u0014\u0015\u0006\u0002\u0016\u0017\u0004\b\u0006\u000e\t\u0007\u0002\u0018\t\u0019\u000e\r\u000e\u001a\u0002\u0013\u0002\u001b\u001b\u001b\u001c\u0017\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u001d\u001e\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u001c\u0007\u0004\u001e\u0002"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"CHAP TER 9AThe Wisdom of the Great InitiateAlas, there has been so little progress in my life that, after 30 years, I feelunqualified to add anything to this sublime chapter.Aha!Progress in modesty! tencies and confusions of our mind.

As a system of Magic, it is akin to some of the ideas ofAustin Spare. It links with the theory of reincarnation: for it is onlywhen we have simplified our minds to the most basic elements of thepattern that we can expect a conscious reincarnation.In such a Magical system, initiation stages are replaced by acontinuous striving towards simplicity, and yet the progress still ismarked by steps: an event disturbs you more than is necessary, youseek to eliminate the implied imbalance, and a whole complex ofpossibilities is ‘mastered’.Teaching in such a Magical order is less obvious to us: the mastermust harass the student until he is clear.

Indeed, the very fact that moral codes have noplace in Magic is the reason why morality plays such an important role.Remember that I am talking about directions, so when I say that moralcodes have no place in Magic I am idealising beyond the horizon. In factthere are moral codes in Magic as practiced. A typical one is Crowley’s “dowhat thou wilt shall be the whole of the law”.

So the original essay focussed mostclearly on the differences between Science and Magic, as that was whereconfusion was currently strongest.In the 90s, however, Religion is considered vaguely cool, and people aregoing on about morality as something which matters rather than somethingwe are eager to transcend. So I add this chapter to address some differencesbetween Magic and Religion, and their different ideas of morality.LOOK, MUM! NO MORALS!In a sense the omission of morality in the original text could be justified bysaying that morality has no place in Magic. As suggested in Chapter 3A,Magic lies the direction of supreme skepticism, of absolute belief inabsolutely nothing, so what place has morality there? I will, however, arguethat this lack of morality in fact gives morality especial importance to Magic.I am, of course, writing about formal systems of morality. These havetheir origin and home in the Religious sector of our compass. The word ofGod, or social recognition of ‘the Good’, tells us of right and wrong. As weprogress to the Science sector morality does not vanish, it simply evolves. Justas we progress via monotheism to the Scientific monoreality of physicalsystems, so also we progress from doing Good in all its forms to one ethicalimperative which is to revere Truth.However, as pointed out in Chapter 1A, the direction of Magic is nottowards Good, nor towards Truth, but rather towards Wholeness. AWholeness in which Bad and Untruth also have their part. So, no matterhow wicked or false something is, it should really be acknowledged and dealtwith in the Magical sector.Media moralists and rationalists talk about bad things as being ‘unthink-able’ — and that very usage sets some of us a challenge to show that every-thing can be thought. For, although the ultimate arbiters in Magic areFeeling and Observation, nevertheless Thinking and Intuition are also highlyrespected and should not be insulted by assuming such arbitrary limits totheir reach.\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0002\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0002\u0003\u0004\u0005\u0005\u0006\u0007\b\t\u0004\u0002\u0004\u000b\u0002\f\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u0002\u0010\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u0002\u0013\u0002\u0014\u0015\u0006\u0002\u0016\u0017\u0004\b\u0006\u000e\t\u0007\u0002\u0018\t\u0019\u000e\r\u000e\u001a\u0002\u0013\u0002\u001b\u001b\u001b\u001c\u0017\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u001d\u001e\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u001c\u0007\u0004\u001e\u0002"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"that sense (which moralists might call ‘conscience’) leads us to work upon ourown natures and thus towards Art.I recall debating this point with a lady from the bookshop Stuart andWatkins — once a bastion of outright Magic but grown very tame and NewAgey. She suggested that they discouraged the heavy Magic literature (likemine) because the people who asked for it were often pretty dubious charac-ters — power hungry, sad dropouts and all that. I admitted that I couldsometimes see what she meant, and yet could argue that the bookshop banwas a bit as if the Salvation Army had shut its doors to people who lookedtoo scruffy, the very people who needed it most. It is the very evil image ofMagic which offers such healing because it not only reaches parts of mewhich other systems of thought would deny or despise, but it also makessomething of those crude impulses.Now ‘black’ Magic is not the only system which offers a place to power-hungry, sad dropouts: they are also welcomed into neo-fascist organisations.But there their impulses appear to become reinforced more than refined.What has gone wrong?In terms of this essay, a fascist organisation is a Religion where ‘good’ isidentified with one particular race and mindset. It therefore reinforces,whereas Magic tends to refine.MAGIC OR RELIGION?As that last example shows, from where I stand fascism and other politics lietowards the Religion quadrant.Some people would disagree, but as far as I see it politics is directedtowards ‘The Good’ as much as any Religion, but it just happens not toequate it with deity as such. Instead ‘The Good’ is equated with ‘racialpurity’, ‘the revolution’, ‘the free market’, ‘equality’ or some such abstractionwhich can appear little different from deity to those less politically motivated.Because we are talking relative directions and not clear categories, therecan be debate about whether politics and other philosophies are Religion, orcan become Religion, or not. In fact, there can even be confusion betweenReligion and Magic — terms which I posit as polar opposites.Whereas earlier chapters elucidated the differences between Science andMagic more in order to clarify the nature of Magic by comparison, in thissection Magic and Religion are compared in order to clarify actual differenceswhich are often misunderstood. This is probably because, as far as today’srationalists are concerned, Magic is just a worse form of the Religion disease.Let us go back to the very start of this book. The difference lies not somuch in the actual practice as in the thinking behind it. Now, many Religiouspeople at some time or another pray for a result — money, children, the heal-ing of a sick friend. As far as I am concerned, that is Magic, not Religion, - ,   wilt and harm no-one”. This is a little more cynical (and therefore moreMagical?) because it admits the possibility that the wholeness of being mightactually intend harm, whereas Crowley’s system is limited by a premise thatexistence is pure joy and so ultimately will work out for the best.But the real essence of morality in Magic is not such compromises, butrather — as I argue at greater length in my third volume of essays — thatwhen one is stripped of all outer moral codes and injunctions, then youbecome fertile ground for a discovery of inner moral sense. This is what reallyhappens during the serious pursuit of Magic.Strict Christians, for example, often claim that, without respect for Godand divine law, the world would descend into anarchy, brutality, murder andmayhem. I find it repugnant that anyone should insist that the only thingstopping them from a lifelong killing spree is their faith in a bloke who reput-edly got nailed to a couple of planks two thousand years ago. So repugnant,that I call upon the sympathy of Scientists and ask “have not Humanistsdemonstrated that it is feasible to deny divine law and yet remain impecca-ble?”Magicians too are blessed with the discovery that ‘anything goes’ does notactually force one to do anything. Indeed, it may only be when given suchfreedom that we come face to face with our own inner integrity.Instead of moral injunctions, Magical practice demands that we ‘clarify’our goals according to those ultimate arbiters Observation and Feeling. It istrue that many people enter Magic with pretty selfish or vengeful objectives,but the effort of clarifying them tends to bring us face to face with deeperobjectives and so closer to our true wills in the Crowleyan sense.So, for example, someone who takes up Magic through an addiction to“gimme tunzamunz” will find that this soul-urge needs to be clarified into “Iwish to become stinking rich”. But is that clear? No, it has no time-qualifier— who wants to become rich on their death-bed? So the urge is furtherexplored and is refined to “I want enough money soon enough to feel that Iam a powerful person who deserves respect from society”. This in turn couldrefine to “I wish to feel effective and thus earn respect from society, and Iwish for money to help further this aim” But what is the ‘effectiveness’ oneseeks to be directed towards? And so the refining process continues.Another person might take up Magic with the even more morallyambiguous aim to destroy all racists. This then can refine, through a desire todestroy racism, towards a desire to increase love between all humankind.As explained in Chapters 3A and Nine, we can enter Magic with prettycrude motives, but the actual practice not only refines these motives butbrings us closer to a discovery of a personal inner moral sense which seemsto say “precisely because everything is permitted, therefore I discover that Iam not only free to, but actually wish to, make choices”.

Although the true intention of this book is notto advocate one way of thought over another, but rather to illustrate four validand complementary paths, the argument is bound to favour Magic because itis the most popularly discredited path and thus most in need of reinstatementagainst its critics.The basic argument for Magical morality against the Religious is ananalogue of the liberal versus disciplinarian debate. The latter demands strictguidelines to keep errant human nature in check, while the former demandsfreedom to allow the goodness of human nature to reach fruition. The liberalblames human wickedness on the distortions of exaggerated discipline anddogmatism, while the disciplinarian blames it on a lack of moral guidance orstandards.This debate is too well worn to need further comment by me. Instead Iwill simply illustrate how communication can break down between Religionand Magic on questions of morality, just as it can break down betweenScience and Magic on questions of fact.Recently there was a bit of fuss in the papers about a football coach whosaid that he believed in reincarnation and that, as he saw it, if someone wasborn with a physical disadvantage in this life it was probably a reflection ofpast karma.Now, reincarnation is a theory strongly associated with certain religions,which I believe to be equally useful as a Magical theory. As a Religious theoryit stems from an intuitive understanding that the universe must be fair,coupled with a logical explanation of why it can appear to be unfair. As aMagical theory it has more to do with observation that nature is permeatedwith progress towards wholeness because living things seed the future — sowhy shouldn’t souls make progress too?From a Magical perspective, then, karma is not about morality but aboutnatural law. So when a reincarnationist ascribes your present affliction to pastkarma, he is not saying that you did anything ‘wrong’ in the past. Nearly allthe media debate on that football coach began with an assumption that hehad blamed physical disability upon ‘past sins’ — and that this was offensiveto cripples. This media version seems highly unlikely, however, because theconcept of karma is an alternative to, and not a refinement of, the concept ofsin.Consider, for example, two superb physical specimens — tall, strong, fitand utterly healthy — who both train and become world class athletes. Oneof them is killed suddenly at the height of his career having never knowninfirmity, while the other lives on into old age and dies in a wheelchair at 98years old. Of the two, the first might well incarnate as a cripple, not because - ,   provided the belief is that such a prayer might bring about the result. Manyself-proclaimed religious people do believe that this is so and some scripturesalso encourage that belief.If, on the other hand, the same prayer is said but the underlying belief ismore along these lines “Lord, your ways are mysterious so I can do no morethan surrender the welfare of my sick brother to your mercy. Nevertheless, asa human being cast in your image it is my nature to wish for help and so Ioffer this prayer” then I consider the same act of prayer to be Religion andnot Magic. It is more about a personal relationship with ultimate good thandirectly trying to heal a brother.What then of the Pagan fire festivals? For many modern city pagansthese are celebrated in order to restore their contact with the currents ofnature — whether deified or not — and so they belong to Magic. In ancienttimes it was done in order to invoke fertility, and that is certainly Magic. Butinsofar as it is done as a pure act of celebration, then it is Religion in theseterms.Now this is getting silly — provided that you think I am simply trying toclarify distinctions. Instead, however, unlike the finger pointing at the moon,I am trying to illustrate the pointing process rather than define a strict linebetween Magic and Religion.Going back to the previous context, the person who joins a racist organ-isation because he believes that Jews are ‘bad’ — and that he is thereforealigning with ‘the good’ against them — is therefore acting Religiously. If thesame action is taken because of a rational calculation that the expatriation ofJews would improve job opportunities for him in the City, then the act couldbe classed as Scientific. If it was performed because “Dad’s a bit of a pacifistwet and I’m pissed off with him and reckon the best way to get up his nosewould be to do a bit of nigger-bashing”, then the same decision could be anact of Magic. Whereas if he joined the organisation purely because he digsthe skinhead style, then it becomes Art.What I am countering here is the notion that these distinctions have nosignificance in face of the obscene reality of the act. Knowing the thinkingactually helps to inform counter-action. In the case of the Scientific reason,it is probably countered by an analysis of a Jewish role in creating, as muchas filling, jobs. In the case of Art it helps to recognise that fashions areephemeral. In the case of Magic I draw attention back to what was said above— if only he could recognise that it is a Magical act, that rebel has started ona voyage which will lead via other routes up Dad’s nose towards a discoveryof what he really wants.That only leaves the most dangerous motivation, which is the Religiousone. The very definers of morality have created a moral problem for us. -     - \u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0002\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0002\u0003\u0004\u0005\u0005\u0006\u0007\b\t\u0004\u0002\u0004\u000b\u0002\f\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u0002\u0010\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u0002\u0013\u0002\u0014\u0015\u0006\u0002\u0016\u0017\u0004\b\u0006\u000e\t\u0007\u0002\u0018\t\u0019\u000e\r\u000e\u001a\u0002\u0013\u0002\u001b\u001b\u001b\u001c\u0017\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u001d\u001e\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u001c\u0007\u0004\u001e\u0002"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"Religion as politics: the human need to be part of a nation or herd and notstand up as an individual.Has Magic more to offer than glib criticism?In Chapter 7A I gave an example of a Magical argument to support abelief in God, an argument designed not to clash too hard with a Scientificeducation. The argument concluded that the universe was probably aconscious being, in other words, that there was a supreme God of ouruniverse. If Magic can do that, why do we need Religion?Well, Religion can offer more. For a start, the Christian religion claimsthat God really cares about each and every one of us, about every sparrow andevery hair on our heads — whereas I stopped my argument at a deity whichstood in relation to the universe as our mind relates to our body. Do I careabout the well-being of every cell and molecule in my body in that personalway? Not really, though as our understanding of cancer grows we might beginto care about every cell, and its creative whims.This idea that the universe really cares, and that our intentions reallymatter, is one of the things that people fear to lose when Religion goes. Therise of Science goes along with the loss of a sense that we are all being partof God’s plan, instead we have a stronger sense of individual identity.In Thundersqueak I suggested that a big issues of the coming Age ofAquarius would be those of Leo opposing Aquarius — the individual versussociety, kingship versus the herd instinct and so on. In Words Made Flesh Idrew two metaphors for the relationship of the individual to society — the‘cog in the machine’ and the ‘drop in the ocean’ — and suggested that we hadmoved on to the second metaphor now.The cog in the machine was an older image: in it each of us is like a cog,of no value in itself but a vital part of the machine. This is like feudal societywhere every person knows their place and has the comfort of knowing wherethey stand, but little sense of individual identity.We are now more like drops in an ocean. Unlike a mere cog, the drop ofwater is as valuable as the ocean itself because it is a microcosm of the whole— all the physics and chemistry of water is contained in that one drop andthe ocean is no more than a giant extrapolation from it. But consider thatdrop as part of the ocean and it is utterly insignificant, it has no justificationor sense of importance as the cog in the machine has.Science has liberated us cogs from the Religious machine and revealedour complexity. We are now shiny drops reflecting the world around us in allour individual glory. But Science, with its acceleration of communication, hasalso brought us to the ocean. I see myself as a drop — an individual with avital message to give to the world — but when I try to express it I am broughtface to face with the fact that I am one of millions of unwanted writers clog-ging up the in-trays of thousands of unwanted publishers when all that the - ,   he had done anything ‘wrong’ in exploiting his body in athletics, but simplybecause he had not experienced the fullness of human existence whichincludes discovering the limitations of the body in sickness, injury and oldage.I say ‘might’ incarnate as a cripple, rather than ‘will’ do so, because thisexample makes no assumption about what had already been dealt with inprevious lives. There is also another possibility: the first athlete, althoughnever knowing physical infirmity directly, might have come across it in aloved one and might have dedicated a lot of time to empathising with thehandicapped and assisting with charitable work — in which case there wouldbe less need to balance his next life with physical affliction. This balancingmechanism is so easily interpreted in Religious terms as ‘punishment for notthinking of handicapped people’ coupled with ‘reward for selfless dedication’that it requires a positive effort to see karma as a totally neutral balancingprocess, with no judgement involved. The media commentators did not makethis effort, and they typified a Religious distortion of Magical ideas.“Handicap blamed on sins of the past” is a double misinterpretation ofkarma; firstly because it assumes that there is something ‘wrong’ about beingborn handicapped, and secondly it deduces that the actions which lead to this‘wrong’ state must therefore have been ‘bad’. The Magical urge towardswholeness does not classify into right and wrong in this way. I am glad thatI was not born with a physical handicap — hardly surprising because I havegot used to certain limitations in my life and have no wish to add to them —and yet I also understand that it might have been very good for me. A phys-ical handicap might have reduced my ability to be a jack-of-all-trades andhave focussed my intelligence into a narrower channel. I might have becomea best selling author and world authority on something instead of a frustratedgeneralist. So, what did I ‘do wrong’ to have been handicapped thus with a fitand demanding body?The purpose of this example is not to demonstrate that Religion sucks,so much as to illustrate how easily communication can fail betweenMagicians and those with ingrained moral assumptions.LOSING RELIGIONChapter 3A suggested that the sort of spiritual and moral authority whichReligion has held over the past two thousand years is being lost to Science,even though there is a current movement away from the intellectual author-ity of Science towards Magical ways of thought. So, once millennial fever hasabated, Religion will go onto the back burner for quite a while.Religious people feel very worried about any decline in Religion, and itis easy to say something glib about human need for Big Daddy God orMummy Goddess and a fear of growing up.

The same is true for everyone —hopeful pop stars, bright eyed school leavers, revolutionaries, inventors... weall feel our enormous value as shining drops, but when we approach the oceanwe just melt into insignificance. Science has given us a cruelly indifferentuniverse compared with a God who knows every hair on our heads.So what can Magic offer as healing? There is nothing to match thefatherly face of God in the ‘believe nothing and so believe everything’Magical mentality — but there is the principle of homeopathy.My original model for this principle was of a family that separated out itstrash before leaving it for the dustmen — recyclables in one bag, the rest inanother. Then a neighbour puts the ‘Scientific’ argument that there is nopoint in wasting time doing that because the council simply puts the wholelot into the one shredder (this was in the early 70s when environmental issueswere not taken so seriously). If the family were Magicians they might still goon separating the trash, I argued, because they could choose to believe thatsuch rituals of dedication to the environment can have value in themselves,quite apart from any Scientific causal value. Like a homeopathic transforma-tion, the intention of the individual drop can have a positive effect upon thewhole ocean. (The extreme version of this is in alchemical projection, wherethe perfection of the individual as a tiny seed of philosophers’ stone, cantransform the whole mass of metal into gold.)This Magical theory, of the value of individual acts of dedication, isanother reason why Magic and Religion can look similar to outsiders. BothReligious and Magical families might be found separating out their trash inthe face of council indifference — the Magical family because they believe itcan be an effective ritual dedication to Gaia, and the Religious family becausethey know that, whatever the council does with the trash, God is still awareof their efforts.So this homeopathic principle does something to restore the sense ofhelplessness and hopelessness that we can all feel in a inter-networked worldof many billion inhabitants.Even more is offered by the Magical principle of the Universal Mindreferred to in Chapter Seven. Taking the virtual reality version of it as exam-ple, the idea that we are programs in a vast information process is an ideawhich can resolve the duality of cog/machine versus drop/ocean. Asprograms we are like the drop, a microcosm of the whole virtual universe —all the laws of programming lie within us. But insert the program into thelarger program and it does not dissolve into insignificance; instead, like thecog in the machine, each sub-routine is also a vital, necessary part of thewhole. -     - Thus we can retain in Magic the liberating notion of individuality inher-ited from a Scientific revolution, and yet restore that sense of importancewithin the whole which Religion had once provided.So cheer up, you Religious bigots — and others!One further matter. I illustrated the directional nature of my compass bysuggesting that Magic, Art, Religion and Science represent movementtowards Wholeness, Beauty, Goodness and Truth respectively. This is riskybecause there are devotees of each who will insist, for example, that “Art isreally about Truth”, Science is about Beauty or Religion about Wholeness.On the one hand such apparent perversity simply reflects the fact thatthese capitalised words represent concepts in what I called the spiritual worldwhere opposites tend to coalesce — so Wholeness, Beauty, Goodness andTruth are really one and the same, corresponding to The Good of Plotinus.At a humbler level however, it reflects a the sort of muddle my compass triesto clarify. So a Scientist appreciating a theory’s beauty is simply exercising ahuman right to persue Art within Science — and this only seems paradoxi-cal, or a diminution of Science, if we forget our directions and imagine thatmy diagram defines four competing categories.

Nice but clearly impractical. Firstly my owninclination towards Artistic thought means that I have little to say onthat subject. But above all this is an essay on Magic, and that is there-fore the most fully explained of the techniques: the others were onlymentioned so that contrast could better illustrate the main subject.However the bulk of the comparison has been with Science: this isbecause it is the most widespread and best understood system of thefour. Inevitably, therefore, this essay will seem to some to be an attackon Science, championing Magic in its stead.Although this is far from being the aim of the essay, it is true thatsome destructive observations about Scientific method have beenmade, because no less aggressive an approach is likely to have anyimpact on those who have been brought up not to question theauthority of Science except in jest. Had Religion still been dominant,it would have been necessary to make similar criticisms of thatmethod and so on; for no technique is at its best when all-powerful.What is more, it must be realised that some of the apparent attackson Science are nothing of the sort in my own eyes, but would seemso to Scientists because of their own form of morality. I ascribe toScientists a large element of what in their own words would bedescribed as ‘self-deception’. This might seem to them a slur, but. asfar as I am concerned it is an element which is basic to all conscious-ness, and therefore I am here admitting the validity of Scientificmethod rather than denying it.No system is ultimately superior, but our own limitations are suchthat we tend to incline more to one system than another, the major-ity being content with the system they are brought up with. If thereader is quite happy in his acceptance of Scientific authority, thenthere is no need for me to tell him or her not to bother about thisessay. If however the reader feels ill at ease with his education intowhat seems like a bizarre and artificial way of thought, then perhapsit will be encouraging to realise that there are equally respectablealternatives. - CHAPTER ELEVENConclusionOne of the images used by Johnstone to illustrate his different tech-niques of thought was to compare the so-called ‘Unknown’ to aswamp. He explained that there are basically four ways to explore aswamp. First, like a hydroplane, you can move so quickly that you donot sink in. Secondly you can fly above the swamp. Thirdly theswamp can be covered over by constructing a solid platform so thatan ever-increasing area of it becomes sound dry land. Fourthly youcan spread your weight over a greater area so that you can cross theswamp without sinking.The first technique was analogous to what he called Artisticthought. It could be used to explore far into the Unknown at greatspeed, but although the traveller came back with exciting tales, he wasusually unable to give very precise directions as to how he travelled.The second technique was compared with Johnstone’s ‘Religious’thought. It too gave a far reaching view, much more clearly set out,but it was very much of a bird’s-eye view and tended to be inferior tothe Artistic method in that it lacked real contact with that which wasdistantly seen.The third technique was the Scientific one. Scientists were likepeople in wheelchairs who needed firm level ground to move about.So when they became interested in some distant area which had beendescribed by Art or Religion, they set about extending their concreteplatform in the given direction. This is a very slow method; the dryground gradually extends whilst shady dogmas are cut down andsoggy hypotheses filled in. But once the new area is reached, there isa tendency to say ‘this bit is as boring as the rest of it — what werethose lunatics talking about?’ For the very process of exploring hasdone so much to change what was being explored, hobgoblins andfoul fiends having rushed away into the jungle at the sound of thefirst myth being exploded.The Magical method is very much one of spreading your weight.It is slower and often less exciting than Religion or Art, but it does"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"CHAP TER 11AA licence to departIn this book I have defined four directions which I called Magic, Art,Religion and Science. I then used those terms — keeping the initialcapital where appropriate in order to remind the reader that they weremine own terms, defining a directionrather than a region.I also needed to remind myself of this, because I surely have attimes written about Science and Magic as if they were regions ascommonly understood. I cannot help at times using the term ‘theNorth’ as a vague catch-all for the region where men start wearingcloth caps, keeping whippets and saying “by gum, yer cheekymunkey”, but it does not mean I have forgotten that the term reallydefines a compass bearing.Most readers will surely continue to use the words magic, science,religion and art to define regions even after reading this book. That’sok. It is useful to have the terms North, South, East, West used asregions as well as directions, and we can accommodate both uses atonce — when the weather forecaster announces that there will be“cold North winds in the East” we understand well enough what ismeant. So too can the reader go back to talking about science andmagic as different countries, without losing the benefit of being ableto refer to my compass when necessary.As an example of one individual view of religion, I quote from apaper called New Science New Religion New Worldwhich is an expan-sion of a talk given to Woodbridge Quaker Study Centre,Birmingham, September 1998, by Frank Parkinson. He writes:“... I should state in advance that I consider genuine religion to havethree characteristics: it is a systematic attempt to know more aboutthe nature of a hypothesized creating power, to establish an appro-priate relationship with it and to take steps towards self transforma-tion.”In my terms, Frank Parkinson is here defining a region of humanactivity which he calls “genuine religion” and I, as a Magical thinker,am quite happy that he should define that region in his own way. AsA more tedious way of expressing this is to suggest that there aresome of us who fall short of the ideal of the rational materialist; eitherbecause of a defective brain structure, or because of defectiveprogramming of that structure, their minds are capable of registeringexperiences which are not only impossible but actually meaningless toa purely rational mind.Two alternatives are open to such people: either to be treated bysurgery, drugs or psychiatry until they become ‘normal’ or else tocome to terms with their own version of the universe. Both have theirdangers: in the second case you will be setting out to explore a worldwhich is much less clearly charted, a large and peculiar world wherethings can happen which could never happen in the rational world.The ‘danger’ is that you will be seduced by the excitement of this newworld, even imagining that the rationalists envy you with your greaterfreedom. Most people arrange some sort of compromise in practice,but sometimes it is an uneasy compromise and such people would dobetter to realise the distinction and to embrace it consciously. For theencouragement of such people this essay was written.Lastly a word for those cabalistically inclined readers who studied thetitle of this essay in the light of the Notaricon: would you be verydisappointed if I failed to expose the Sex Secrets of the BlackMagicians?Ah well, it is quickly done — vide infra.THE END -     - \u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0002\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0002\u0003\u0004\u0005\u0005\u0006\u0007\b\t\u0004\u0002\u0004\u000b\u0002\f\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u0002\u0010\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u0002\u0013\u0002\u0014\u0015\u0006\u0002\u0016\u0017\u0004\b\u0006\u000e\t\u0007\u0002\u0018\t\u0019\u000e\r\u000e\u001a\u0002\u0013\u0002\u001b\u001b\u001b\u001c\u0017\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u001d\u001e\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u001c\u0007\u0004\u001e\u0002"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"I have already used my compass within this region of his, when Ipointed out in Chapter 3A that his desire to change the publicperception of science was in fact a desire to do Magic, in my terms.It is a Magical spell to banish Magic, and that some people mock hisendeavours because they more or less unconsciously recognise thisirrational element in his work. I also pointed out that, by fostering thenotion that ideas can evolve like life forms and occupy territory in theecology of human culture, he had evoked the demon that New AgeMagical ideas might be proving fitter to survive than his own ideas.Again, there is a temptation to use this compass to attack hiswork, breaking it down and saying that bits of it are ‘not Scientific’.instead I would like to salute him and offer the discovery that even inhis polemic approach I can find Magic, Art and Religion as well asScience. The talk he gave at Cheltenham about ‘unweaving the rain-bow’ held genuine poetry for me, as well as being good Magic. He isa also a great preacher... Hi there, Richard!So I conclude by allowing a return to the normal use of the wordsart, science, magic and religion. It’s only human, and one book won’tbreak the habit of ages. Like a true amoral Magician, I accept thatwith a shrug. My theory is being given the license to depart. In thefirst edition this was done more dramatically, in a chapter which hasbeen re-written and put earlier in this edition. So I will now appendthe closing words to the original Chapter 9.In view of this, it is clearly desirable that there should be an effort todivert the cycle from its obvious course, and to encourage mankind tobe honest and admit to Magic. For only when we face up to Magicand recognise it as such can we hope to learn to control or come toterms with it. Until that time it is a dangerous quicksand beneath apaper-thin floor of bogus Scientific jargon.With this in mind, Lemuel Johnstone initiated a Magical opera-tion to alter the course of human destiny choosing the time of itscommencement as a moment which, expressed in years, is equal tothe fourth power of 6.66, ie the number of the Beast extended inthree dimensions of space and one of time. The final link of the oper-ation was begun at a time which, expressed in years, equals 1974.9136 or the square of 44.44. This moment of time, Cabalisticallyconsidered, so symbolises the principle of growth of plans that it can -    an explorer of his region, however, I take out my compass and say thatit contains three sub-regions. What he describes as “a systematicattempt to know more about the nature of a hypothesized creativepower” I would describe as the Science of his region — even thoughI recognise that it might not share any territory with the region whichRichard Dawkins describes as “science”. His wish to “establish anappropriate relationship with it” is what I would consider to be theReligious quarter of his religion, and his “steps towards self transfor-mation” are what I would indicate as the Magical quarter of his reli-gion.It is tempting to try to reshape his definition by paring away theScience and Magic bits and say “the only really Religious bit was thesecond bit”. To support this I could quote his later remark “The endof religious evolution, from the present standpoint, is to establish arelationship with the primal power...”. However, any attempt to sayhe is ‘wrong’ and that I can subdivide his religion and ‘purify’ theconcept would be a mistake, because it would mean I was beginningto accept my four directions as four sub-regions, and so slipping awayfrom the proper Magical use of my compass as an aid to navigation.Instead of thus reducing his definition, let me attempt a morepositive exploration. Surely, we should be able to discover a fourthregion in his religion — an Artistic region? A fourth characteristic ofgenuine religion which could be described as ‘celebrating the hypoth-esized creating power’ or ‘expressing the feelings engendered by therelationship formed with it’. Why has Frank Parkinson not includedthis region? I note that he is also a poet — so maybe he simply tookit for granted.Whereas the critical use of my compass which tended to breakdown and diminish the region he called ‘genuine religion’ could beseen as an act of aggression, I like to think that Parkinson wouldwelcome my second use of the compass, and thank me for remindinghim of that fourth part of his genuine religion.If I turn back to Richard Dawkins, who must also have a personalunderstanding of a region which he calls ‘science’ and which lieswithin a region which may be called ‘rational human activity’. Iassume this is so, because he clearly wishes to defend this region fromirrational tendencies which lie beyond its borders. -     - "},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"this theory of Johnstone’s is being given ‘the license to depart’. It hasserved its purpose; it has proved helpful in an era which led up to thewriting of this essay. During that time it began to amass evidence,and even proved that it had predictive ability. In other words:Johnstone’s teaching-aid was getting too strong a hold on our lives,and was beginning to exert an influence upon the universe. So it getsthe license to depart; it is dismissed.Prediction is the Waterloo of any philosopher: the prophet ofdoom offers himself as a voluntary sacrifice which is sufficient topostpone the doom he prophesies. For the announcement of a doomis the stimulus which leads the world to take steps to avoid that verydoom and thus cause the prophecy to fail. Thus the reputation of theprophet is slaughtered. But of course a prophet’s reputation is every-thing, so it is the prophet who dies. Only Artists can surviveprophecy — for no-one recognises their prophecies until after theyhave been realised.A Religious prophet exposes himself to ridicule, but knows thatthe true faithful will stand by him. Recently there has been a torrentof Scientific prophets, not one of them successful, and so far the pressshows no sign of tiring of them. When a Magician makes a prophecy,he similarly exposes himself to ridicule, but his consolation is that hedoes it with a better understanding of what is involved.I ridicule my theory in this last chapter in order to dispose of it. Iridicule it to save myself from any danger of ‘acceptance’: but there arestill likely to be people who only read on in order to find out just howmuch of my argument is spoof, just how much I really believe, justhow much can be proved. Here is your last lesson: I will not tell you,and even if I did you would do well not to believe me.Too slavish an acceptance of Religious and now Scientific author-ity has led us all to depend too much upon others for our ideas oftruth. One expert makes an interesting observation, and we are gluedto our television in order not to miss other experts’ views of his opin-ions. A book presenting a sensational new version of evolutionappears and becomes a bestseller: instead of accepting or rejecting itin the light of our own experience, we wait for other books to be writ-ten which either support or attack the first one. -    be considered as the instant of equilibrium before commencementwhere the least effort of conscious will could suffice to alter the entiredestiny of this planetThe climax of this operation’s working can be expected at a timeequal to the four dimensional extension of the number 6. 66666 when..(Has he gone mad? Isn’t it a pity to spoil a sensible essay on Magicwith all this Armageddon nonsense?)To many readers, this whole chapter would seem a blot on my thesis,for it is only in this chapter that there has been a major departurefrom cosy theory into historic fact. Why has this essay been mined bya clumsy and ill-researched attempt to extend its ideas into the fieldof history and of prediction? If I really wanted to impress, why didn’tI back up my vague pronouncements with some accurate dates andquotations from reliable sources?It would have been perfectly possible; a number of relevantvolumes are at hand. A Scientist can produce historical evidence insupport of his theories by carefully selecting those examples which fithis hypothesis, and rejecting those which do not as being insuffi-ciently well-documented — for otherwise the reason for their notfitting his theory would be apparent in the documentary evidence. Injust the same way a Magician can support his ideas by selecting thefacts which feel right, correctly considering other facts to be merelyan obscuring influence, This is no fraud; this is simply the processupon which our consciousness, and therefore our universe, is founded— the Religious arguer rejects deceitful facts, the Artist rejects what-ever he or his aesthetic chooses.Why then was my argument not better supported? Why make afool of myself?It could be argued that there is a paradox in Johnstone’s thesis inthat it could never be put into a form which might convince aScientist without disproving one of the basic deductions of the thesisitself. I therefore defend myself from the embarrassment of ‘recogni-tion’ by playing the fool.However this argument merely obscured a more Magical purpose: -     - \u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0002\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0002\u0003\u0004\u0005\u0005\u0006\u0007\b\t\u0004\u0002\u0004\u000b\u0002\f\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u0002\u0010\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u0002\u0013\u0002\u0014\u0015\u0006\u0002\u0016\u0017\u0004\b\u0006\u000e\t\u0007\u0002\u0018\t\u0019\u000e\r\u000e\u001a\u0002\u0013\u0002\u001b\u001b\u001b\u001c\u0017\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u001d\u001e\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u001c\u0007\u0004\u001e\u0002"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"Appendix ABibliography1.

It is often said that a true teachernever asks for money: but I assure you that a true teacher would startto demand an extortionate fee if he suspected that you had no othertests of his worth.So many people approach Magic with the wrong ideas that aMagical teacher soon realises that the best way to dispose of pupilswho are cramped by experience is for the teacher himself to arrangeto be caught cheating, for those who are cramped by morality theteacher had best appear immoral, for those who are cramped by ideasof greatness the teacher should appear feeble and ineffectual, and soon. The few pupils who survive these hurdles are either geniuses oridiots; both are adequate.So you must forget your authorities and observe. Make up yourown mind how much of this essay is true, how much of it is a clumsyattempt to say something which is true, how much is fraud and howmuch is error. -     - "},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"Appendix BThe New Age and MagicIn Chapter 2 I look at specific areas of Magic and in Chapter 2A I add someexamples to bring the book more up to date. One Magical area which hasemerged since this book was written — and some say because the book waswritten — is the ‘New Age’. I am covering the New Age in an appendixbecause it is a rather special case.Anyone acquainted with New Age ideas will see that they definitely fallwithin the sector I have described as Magic — the emphasis on feeling overlogic, the subjectivity, the solipsism and the personal growth are all factorsshared by Magic and the New Age.But the New Age is more than just a specific technique or set of ideas,indeed it is a movement as broad as Magic itself. So do we consider Magicand the New Age to be one and the same thing?On the one hand they have so much in common at the theoretical level,on the other there is a very different atmosphere about the two, to the extentthat they can appear to their respective devotees as near opposites or rivals.Some New Agers see Magic as irredeemably sinister, just as some Magicianssee the New Age as pathetically wet. And yet the people I classify asScientists would dismiss both groups as cranks — with Magic being counteda particularly dotty subset of the general New Age delusion rather than beinga great embracing sector of human endeavour.This paradox is not dissimilar to the often violent antipathy betweenCatholics and Protestants — a distinction in which the two groups canperceive themselves as utter polar opposites, while those not involved couldhardly tell the two Religious groups apart.Although it could be hard to define a clear distinction between Magicand the New Age, I believe that differences are beginning to emerge.On Saturday I was in the biggest bookshop in Cheltenham with a friendand I glanced at the Magic section in the spirit of market research. I foundthree bays under the heading “Mind Body and Spirit” which I have come torecognise as a euphemism for New Age. I noted that “Science” only occupieda single bay. Under MBS there were sub-heading for Astrology, UFOs,Myths, Paganism, Witchcraft and so on... but there was none for Magic.This was a new development — so I scanned the other sections to see wherethe Magic books had been allocated, and I found none.This was disturbing for someone currently engaged in publishing bookson Magic. So I asked an American literary agent who visited me that week-end about current attitudes and she confirmed that the word Magic is nowStatistis — Ad Quae Excoginatio Eius Contributionis Ultimae AdMagisterium Magicae Artis Nostrae Addita Est.

The New Age salves those fears by accentuating the positive and elim-inating the negative so all is discussed in terms of “light” with little referenceto the role of darkness except as an error waiting for the light.The result is a version of Magic which is not intimidating to the public— “Magic Without Fears” in place of Crowley’s “Magick Without Tears”.Now I really love the New Age, and I reckon it does a superb job atpromoting the positives and giving a great deal to humanity. I love it becauseI still have Magic to handle my negatives. But I am myself anxious about thepossibilities of a New Age without Magic — as in those bookshop shelves.As explained at length in my other book, such religious devotion to theGood, or Light, or Purity, or Perfection without some balancing attention tothe negatives could lead us down the path beaten by the Nazis if we are notcareful.So I was unhappy about the lack of Magic on those bookshelves. And Iwas disappointed in the way things seemed to be going. The publishers, likethe media, have turned their backs on Magic. Whereas New Age books arereviewed with derision in the more serious press, books on Magical theoryand practice get no mention at all. They do not seem to understand that, byallocating a position for Magic beneath their contempt, these people’scontempt for the New Age amounts to a form of recognition — reflectednow by three bays of shelves to Science’s one.I would not expect Scientists to champion Magic, but they might at leastrecognise that it could prove a more lively opponent. Magic might offendScience by seeing it as an ‘alternative world view’, but that is at least a neutralassessment compared with the judgmental New Age concept of an ‘outdatedpatriarchal paradigm’. Magic could at least offer a vigorous sparring partnerfor rationality, whereas the New Age would simply absorb and overwhelm it.Simply because the New Age presents itself as an easier target for mock-ery by the rational mind, thus it has been fostered like a cuckoo in theScientific nest while Magic has been pushed aside.So here is our final test for Magic. An author weeping in the early hoursof the morning at his failure, because booksellers have joined the rest of thebusiness world in believing that the branding is more important than theproduct. What is he to do?He should recognise that the idea that “the branding is more importantthan the product” is itself a Magical principle of such profundity to almostamount to a definition of Magic itself. He should allow the world to makeits choices as he has made his own. He should consider whether life mightnot have intended more for him than simply to be a conduit for philosophies.He should recognise that the end of writing will free great reserves of enthu-siasm for other pursuits.  -     considered to be a negative marketing proposition, and that she even had anauthor who was currently reframing Magic into more acceptable terms fortoday’s publishers.That night I wept. For all my life I have been continuing Crowley’s workof explaining Magic in as clear and undogmatic manner as I could, hoping todispel superstitious fear and invoke understanding and sympathy and delight.To his Magick Without Tears and his Magick In Theory And practice I hadadded mine own elementary textbooks like this one, and now the bookshopshad closed ranks with the publishers to exclude my babies.Three bays of New Age books and not a single Magic volume — so atleast the marketing folks recognise a clear distinction between Magic and theNew Age.Mine own views on this distinction have been spelled out in an essay inWhat I Did In My Holidays, so I will only review them briefly here. Theyquote Crowley’s concept of three aeons which bear no relation to the cyclesof history suggested in this book (Chapter 3A). According to Crowley a newcultural impulse is beginning this century on a par with the cultural changesymbolised by the birth of christianity. I argued that the position of the NewAge in this transformation might, in retrospect, seem analogous to the posi-tion of Pauline christianity in the previous era.As I saw it, Christ’s teaching invoked ideas of tolerance, love and forgive-ness which were highly revolutionary in terms of the dogmatic and inflexibleassumptions of the pre-christian era. This christian message proved too radi-cal for its time and it might not have survived had not St Paul repackaged itin a less tolerant and more dogmatic form which people found easier to swal-low. On the one hand you could argue that St Paul corrupted Christ’smessage, on the other you could say that christianity only survived becausehe knew how to market its core values — and these include a vision of perfec-tion through the imitation of Christ.So I considered the possibility that the New Age was a similar exercisefor today. It amounted to a rephrasing of the core values of Crowley’sthelemic philosophy, whilst retaining the concept of perfection which reallyhad no place in thelemic relativism.Rephrasing this in the terms used in this book, I would say that the NewAge is very much the same as Magic as described in these pages, except thatit has been modified by restricting the wholism which I believe to be funda-mental to Magic.What Religious people fear about Magic is that it embraces Evil as wellas Good — as I explain in Chapter 10A it is not advocating Evil but simplymore prepared to recognise its place within creation. What Scientific peopledespise about Magic is that it embraces Falsehood and Illusion as well asTruth — with the same qualification as before.
