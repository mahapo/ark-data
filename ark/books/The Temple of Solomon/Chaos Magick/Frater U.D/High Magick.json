How many minds have already pondered this subject? Magic is probably one of the most difficult, most di­versified, and most fascinating of all the occult sciences either as a supporter or oppo­nent, as an initiate or as an unknowing person! Magicians were (and still are) often con­sidered to be loathsome creatures with no desire whatsoever to conform to an external temporal power. They were viewed as people wil1ing to commit the crime of not accept­ing the concepts of \"reality, and \"the healthy limits of morals and decency,, as forced upon them by religion and society, priests and world leaders; as people who refuse to serve any gods or goddesses apart from their own, no matter whether they call them Hermes or Hekate, Baal or Baphomet, Lilith or Lucifer, idealism or materialism, ratio­nalism or irrationalism, I or myself the list goes on. The magician, whether male or female, was always a psychonaut, a soul searcher, someone who wanted to peek behind the «Veil of Isis''; a person who could never rest until he or she discovered (or at least had a good idea about) ((what holds the world to­gether deep down inside.\" Zoroaster was considered a magician, as were Moses, SaJomo, Milarepa, and even Jesus Christ. Raimundus Lullus belonged to this crowd of different thinkers and, more importantly, different doers. Jacques de Molay, Agrippa von Nettesheim, Theophrastus Bombast us Paracelsus, Doctor Faustus, Athanasius Kircher, 3"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"Cagliostro, the Comte de Saint Germain ... .. the list could go on forever, packed full with truly historic figures, and an infinite number of mythical ones as well. Despite all the persecution by the church and government, this list never ends, not even in modern times, this so-called '<Age of Enlightenment,') this time of rationalism and materialism. Witnesses along the way included Robert Fludd (also called Robertus de FJuctibus), Dr. John Dee, Edward Kelley, Frances Barrett, Alan Bennett, Eliphas Levi, Papus, Stanislas de Gua'ita, Sar Merod.ack Josephin Peladan, Samuel Liddell McGregor Mathers, Arthur Waite, Karl Kellner, Theodor Reuss, AJeister Crowley, Austin Osman Spare, Ludwig Stau­denmaier, Musallam, Rah-Omir Quintscher, Herbert Fritsche, Franz Bardon, and Gre­gor A. Gregorius. For the time being, we prefer to not mention those who are still alive (and this list keeps growing and growing) for reasons of modesty and the lack of historical distance required. Besides, it's simply i.mpossible to mention them all, and we)ll encounter n1.any of these people frequently enough throughout the course of this book anyway. So you see, if you decide to pursue the path of magic, you'll find yourself among quite colorful company. Like in any large family, these include geniuses and skilled ex­perts that stand out among the rest, but also simpler souJs, and even a few quacks (who are actua1ly quite necessary in fact!). Magicians are all individualists who prefer not to be categorized or labeled in simple terms that do nothing to promote understanding, but who actually distort the picture instead. The apparent contradictions in the writings of magic authors can be explained by this fact, as well as by magic's extreme subjectivity that we will encounter again and again. This book is intended to give you a comprehensive and well-rounded introduction to practical magic. This includes thorough background information about the Black Arts, which all magicians draw on, whether consciously or subconsciously. Studying the older authors has many advantages, but some disadvantages as well. But when done in a sensible fashion and accompanied by a keen awareness of history, it saves us the trouble of having to \"discover the wheel\" all over again. Plus, there is much to gain through the rich experience and vast knowledge of our forefathers. Of course, in order to properly judge their work, sound knowledge of the historical background and context of these ideas is required. For example, the role played by Christian phrases in medieval spell books' can only be understood if one also is familiar 4 Introduction"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"with the intellectual history of the period in which the magician lived, such as the su­premacy of the church and the dangers of witch .. hunts. Therefore it's absolutely neces­sary to treat our forefathers with the utmost respect. But this respect must also be critical. Just because ifs old doesn't automatically mean ifs good! Lots of things have found their way into traditional magic that we can (and should, if we really want to progress) rely on comfortably. This includes the secretiveness of early times as well as the static recitation of individual fo rmulas without explaining the basic laws and structures of magic, which can be used by any halfway intelligent be­ginner to create such formulas him-or herself in just a short period of time. For this reason, our training manual will not be short of criticism where it seems appropriate. Of course, you don,t need to agree with everything we say; even our statements reflect merely a subjective approach to magic, which is the only way it could possibly be, be­cause magic can,t be anything else! The statements that you're now expecting mainly concern the practice of magic. Since each person has a different idea of what \"practice\" actually means, we're going to clear up the matter right away, so that everyone knows exactly how we define it: Magical practice means the application of magical laws, teachings, and techniques and observing the results. Magic that only takes place on paper is a ridicule of magical knowledge and magical wisdom. With magic, one desires to influence every aspect of one's fate that seems be­yond control by using just ordinary measures and the magician can succeed! We,ll be exploring and investigating microcosmic and macrocosmic laws, techniques that lead to material success and those used for mystical reflection and spiritual growth. Modern magic is primarily a path to self-discovery or spiritual wholeness. Unlike re­ligion and mysticism (not to be confused with mystics), magic fundamentally denies that spirit and matter exist as opposites. Instead, it considers them to be one · a unity, a whole. The spirit is in no way «better)) than matter, and matter isn,t \"unholier, than the spirit. Both complement one another, learn from one another, and are interwoven into a fine tissue that we caJl <<reality\" (which in turn is responsible for posing our greatest thinkers with seemingly unsolvable problems, and enticing our simpler thinkers into com­ing up with fast, superficial answers and shallow systems for solving these problems!). Introduction 5"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"Please always keep a critical distance. Don't accept anything without examining it first until you can confirm it through your own practice. Always be a researcher, a psy­chonaut who travels to new regions and those that have already been visited throughout the centuries, and discover your own impressions of the climate there, the condition of the soil, the riches and the dangers, and ... yes, even the residents there. Anything that you haven,t experienced yourself is meaningless: a paper dream, a hol­low promise of unspeakable adventure and treasures in the deepest depths of your soul, with limits beyond imagination that you could barely just begin to explore. Only your personal experience can bring this world and this universe (or these universes) to life and make magic more than just a fantasy of wayward, delirious spirits such as some bi­ased pseudo-skeptics seem to believe. Magic can only be as vivacious as the magician his- or herself. Without magic, the magician is meaningless, and don't be surprised if one day you discover that without the magician, magic is just as meaningless! And one more thing: If you choose this path, you need to understand right from the start that it never ends; once you begin with magic, it will always be a part of you. Only a few have allowed themselves to be swayed from this path once they've overcome the first obstacles and taken their first breaths of magical freedom. Magic can give a person everything, but it can take everything as well if one doesn't understand that he or she is obligated to serve. Not some senile or crazy old god im­posed upon him by others, but rather serving that which makes one a human being: one,s purpose and goals in life, one's \"Holy Guardian Anger' as it was called in medieval magic, one,s \"Will,, or \"Thelema,, as expressed by one of the greatest magicians of the twentieth century, and one,s Self or the discovery and integration hereof as defined by modern-day psychoanalysis; in short, everything that makes the seeker a magician, an aspirant, a pilgrim, a humble student, and a dignified master. Modern magic aims to satisfy and make use of both sides of yo ur personality, the ra­tional as well as the intuitional. Modern brain research refers to two halves of the brain. In simple terms, the left half is connected to the right half of the body and ifs responsi­ble for the rational, such as thought, calculation, planning, and so on. The right half of the brain controls the left side of the body and, along with it, the intuitional, such as feeling and sensation, trance and vision, and so on. We'll encounter this principle 6 Introduction"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"shortly in the first definition of magic in the next section where magic is described as b .

My own personal magical motto is: ((VBIQVE DJEMON ... VBIQVE DEVS ... , In English this n1eans: ((THE DEMON IS IN EVERYTHING, THE GOD IS IN EVERY­THING.,, This is a challenge for us to always see and respect both sides. Maybe you've heard of the colloquial German proverb Wa s dem einen seine Eule, ist dem anderen seine Nachtigall (\"One man,·s owl is another man's nightingale,).

That always was a good thing, and it still is, but a person should only breathe in an atmosphere thafs suitable for him or her. And that's why we'd like to adopt the follow­ing motto, used by the old gentlemen from the magic mountain of Drachenfels, for this book as well.

Introduction 7"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"• •"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"I Before we start discussing the actual practice of magic, we first need to know what ifs all about. Throughout the years, an endless number of definitions of the word ((magic, have popped up, and we,ll have to deal with many of these in order to understand the concept of magical practice. Probably the most famous definition came from one of the most significant magi­cians of the twentieth century, Aleister Crowley ( 1875-1947): Magic is the Science and Art of Causing Changes to Occur in Conformity with Will. Although this definition actually describes the core of magical practice quite well, ifs a bit too general and generic for the layperson and beginner to understand. Usually something quite different or special is expected of the term «magic,\" namely a discipline that's more concerned with \"subtle, influences, such as the shaping of one,s destiny and «coincidences., Plus, the above definition offers no clue whatsoever as to the techniques and methods used in magic. Some authors such as Israel Regardie and Francis King have taken this into account and have attempted to expand on Crowley's definition: Magic is the science and art of using states of altered consciousness fo r causi.ng changes to occur in conformity with will. 9"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"This solution isn't exactly the best either, but it's good enough for the start. Let's take a closer look at it since this definition already contains one important practical formula. First of all, the terms \"arf, and ((science, are important here. Often the term \"occult science'' is used, but the occultist (or occult scientist) generally defines ''science, quite differently than the ''exact'' or ((natural scientist, does. ln the attempt to earn the recog­nition of orthodox schoolbook science, many occultists (and even magicians) have tried to use the word \"scientific, to describe their discipline. This is only true as long as magic uses scientific methods. In technical jargon, it's ((empirical, or \"empirically scientific,, which applies to everyday practical magic at least. This means that magic first aims at what is visibly successful. On the other hand, the term ''art') refers to the more intuitive area of magic that in­cludes ''fine instincts', and feelings in general, as well as the sensitivity for subtle energies (such as those involved in the various types of clairvoyance). Dreams and visions also fall under the ('art', aspect of magic, but thought and the knowledge of correlations, on the other hand, belong to the ((science\" aspect. In summary, magic makes use of both the so-called \"rational, and \"irrational\" com­ponents of the human personality. Since the word \"irrationar' has a negative connota­tion in this age of rationalism ((irrational'> is often equated with \"foolish,, \"mad,\" \"crazy,\" \"ill-considered\"), we prefer to caU it ((the intuitive side\" of the magician. We see that magic actually aims at achieving the spiritual totality and unity of a per­son. This has purely practical reasons, because only when both sides work together har­n1oniously can magical results be achieve, results that often appear as though they would disprove all (scientific) laws of nature, which of course isn't true, as we'll see throughout this book. But magic, however, is even more than the art and science of achieving unity of the soul. Let's begin with everyday practical magic, also called ulower magic;' which is a term that's certainly not meant to be derogatory, but rather serves the purpose of distinguish­ing from the more mystical-religious <'high magic\" in terms of the techniques and con­tents involved. In practice, a person needs to use both aspects (the rational and the intu­itive) to effectively perforn1 a successful act of magic. This happens through two of the three most important basic components of the magical act, namely the combination of 10 What Is Magic?"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"will and imagination. (We)ll discuss the third factor shortly, namely \"states of altered consciousness.\") We've illustrated this in Chart l. Look at the diagram closely for a few minutes and try to add more features to each appropriate colun1n. Try to think of other things that would belong to the area of «art,,, and some that would fit into the \"science,, column as well. You,ll also notice that we've created a relationship between \"arf' and «imagination,\" as welJ as one between \"scienceu and '(will., Art ,. right side of brain ,. left side of body * intuition * vision • sensation * premonition • synthetic * cyclical * n1ythical * federalist • creative chaos • symbol-logical * irrational Imagination Magic Science * left side of brain Jt right side of body * logic )t thought * consideration lt calculation * analytical lt linear * factual .,. centralist * maintains order * formally logical * rational Will Chart 1: Diagranr of tile basic structure of magic What Is Magic? 11"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"• \"Art, corresponds to \"imagination, by means of its intuitive nature, while \"science'' cor­responds to \"will'' through its reflectivity and its clear and precise objectives. Thus we al­ready have a preliminary equation: WILL+ IMAGINATION= MAGIC. Actually, this was considered to be the ultimate basic formula of magic for many years. Some disciplines such as positive thinking, in which certain events and situations are intentionally C(wilJ>') visualized C'imagination\") as realistically as possible, work al­most exclusively according to this principle, and are quite successful in doing so at that. But if we look at our definition once again, we'll notice that there's something still miss­ing in this equation: the <<states of altered consciousness.'' These states of altered con­sciousness that are used in magic are referred to as magical trance or gnosis. Ifs impor­tant to remember that the magical trance usually has nothing to do with the hypnotic full trance in which the will of the hypnotized person is largely shut off or controlled by someone else. This would also violate the statement \"in conformity with will,,, because here we mean a clear and conscious will.1 But if we,re already using our imagination and will, why do we still need magical trance? In order to understand this, we need to understand the structure of our psyche and how it works, because we like to assume that magical power and the ability to per­form magic is an inner-spiritual occurrence. Conscious Mind Censor ' Subconscious Mind Chart 2: The basic structure of the psyche In Chart 2, we present a simplified form of the common model of the human psyche as provided by modern psychoanalysis. First we see the conscious mind, also known as the daytime or waking consciousness. In the lower portion of the chart we can see the sub­conscious mind, which is also called the unconscious. This includes everything that usu­ally escapes our conscious mind. Although ifs constantly active, we usually only notice it when we dream. The so-called censor is located between the conscious and subcon-12 What Is Magic?"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"scious minds. It represents a sort of \"two-way filter., On the one hand, it ensures the se­lective perception of the stimuli of the outside world. On the other hand, it protects the conscious mind from the uncontrolled flooding of information from the subconscious mind, which includes repressions and complexes. The censor is assigned a vital function, namely the maintenance of what we generally call \"spiritual health., It's of great impor­tance to realize this to prevent us from thinking of the censor as an ((evil enemy\" thafs just trying to spoil us magicians from having fun in life! But unfortunately, this happens quite frequently. Admittedly, the censor has a considerable disadvantage as well, namely that it's ex­tremely conservative. Only reluctantly does it allow the conscious mind to make direct and immediate contact with the subconscious mind, thereby escaping its control. You could compare it to a slightly distrustful \"palace guard,'' a loyal, brave servant to his mas­ter, but sometimes too worried about his own safety to allow and admit new situations without careful examination. Actually one of the most important \"tricks', in magic is ten1porarily turning off the censor in order to directly tap the source of power (the subconscious mind) and assign it specific tasks. This happens through magical or gnostic trance. This state often resem­bles the hazy period just before falling asleep in which the conscious mind is still active but quite subdued. In this state, it can exchange information directly with the subcon­scious mind, e.g., in the form of images. During magical trance, the censor is in a way \"put to sleep.\" Ideally, it would ((sleep)) very lightly and only awake in an emergency. By the way, this corresponds to the role of the sword in magic, as we�ll see later on when we discuss the ritual weapons. Thus, we now have the complete structure of magic that corresponds to our ex­tended definition as depicted in Chart 3 below. Imagination ..._( _, --Trance I . Magtc Will J Chart 3: The basic structure of magic (II) What Is Magic? 13"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"In comparison, Chart 4 (next page) reflects the same concept in the form of a \"math­emagical equation., It would be best for you to study these charts carefully and even memorize them since we)U be running into similar formulas throughout the course of thjs book. This isn't just a game! On the contrary, fo.rmuJas are mnemonic abbreviations to help us memorize rules and .laws from which practical derivatives can be gained. One goal of this book is to point out the basic structures of magic and to clarify them. In this respect, this is an entirely new concept since most of the magical literature available today is written like a ''recipe book.,' Instead of explaining the basic laws that govern magic, most authors even the older ones usually just provide individual ''recipes.'' Rituals for protection from an enemy, magical glyphs for happiness and prosperity, amulets to prevent the plague and cholera, mantras (magic words) for ((attracting a prince,' or conjuring spirits, recipes for getting rid of warts, magic potions for ((winning the love of a man/woman,, and so on. Even (and especially!) the traditional magical ((practice literature, of most recent times follows this principle. Unfortunately, what's often misunderstood here is the fact that such recipes are not effective \"automatically, by themselves! This is a mistake that many people, especially beginners, continue to make again and again. They constantly search for the ((real, true, 100 percent effective rituar' or the \"ultimate magical formula., Even today there are more than enough quacks around who,d be eager to hold out a hand and sell you a recipe without explain­ing the conditions necessary to make it work. Now I'm not saying that all such recipes are completely useless. But if we're not able to understand the basic formula of magic first before we use them, they,re not even worth the paper that they're written on. And even if they do work sometimes, it can be easily seen that will, imagination, and gnosis played an important role as well. However, once you're familiar with the basic laws and formulas of magic, you can create your own \"recipes', on the basis of these, in the same way that every magician ba­sically writes his or her own grimoire or ((book of magic.,, A large part of our work here will deal with doing just this. But as with any other dis-­cipline, the basics need to be mastered first, otherwise \"1 + 1\" will never be learned! These basics are the \"mathemagical,, structuraJ formulas that we'U continually confront you with in various versions. 14 What Is Magic?"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"M=w+i+g �euc M = magical act w =will i = imagination g = gnosis (mag. trance) Chart 4: The first basic fo,-,PJu/a of magic As seen in the above statements, we can see that the focus of a magical education must be on the training of WILL, IMAGINATION, and TRANCE in order to enable efficient work within this paradigm or model of explanation. There are a number of magic books that are dedicated to this. For example, the books by Franz Bardon (especially Initiation into Hermetics) contain a number of basic exercises that focus on self-discipline and mental training, such as visualization and imagination. Bardon's exercises are excellently structured and you can make a great deal of progress in magic by using them. Admit­tedly, progress is slow as a snail if the prescribed time schedule is strictly adhered to. For example, you must be able to visualize an object for ten minutes without the slightest loss of concentration, and be able to achieve a state of empty mind for this length of time as well. Without a doubt, this can be very useful to magic. However, practice has re­vealed that such maximum requirements tend to scare off people unnecessarily, espe­cially beginners, and that they can even distract from the actual principal of magic. The fear of not doing the exercise \"properly,, or not being able to master it is often an obsta­cle that can be avoided. In other words, it can be done much easier and faster, which sigil magic proves, and that's what we,ll be dealing with in the next section. But that doesn't mean that the magician-in-training can avoid hard, diligent work­on the contrary, even a \"master\" with decades of successful experience needs to repeat certain basics once in awhile to avoid \"getting rusty.\" Especially since one of the things that makes this discipline so interesting is that you can never stop learning; there's al­ways something new, something undiscovered and unknown, and, above all, something What Is Magic? 15"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"that's unmastered. The challenges are countless and a person that always keeps his or her eyes open will never get bored with magic. That's why we,re presenting this basic maxim right at the start of this book: Diligent practice on a regular basis is the key to acquiring magical skills! You should know that it's entirely up to you how fast or how slow magic ((works,, for you. Although there's no denying that some people have a certain ((talent', for magic in various degrees, the importance of this talent is usually drastically overestimated. Never • n1ake the common beginner's mistake of envying the <'naturals,, who seem to be able to accomplish many things in magic straight off (without painstaking work and previous training). In fact, you should actually feel quite sorry for them. Since they,ve been ((given, so much and many things fall right into their laps, they usually lack the self-dis­cipline and severity of those with less talent who have to earn every little thing with sweat and tears. In magical terms, this self-discipline and severity represent the impor­tant aspect of grounding since they're the best protection against two of the most com­mon and most dangerous illnesses of magicians: overestimating oneself, and the perse­cution complex. A good magician is humble in the same way a good warrior is humble: One knows his or her own limits way too well to be deceived by wishful thinking. A war­rior never makes the mistake of underestimating a problem, the enemy, or a challenge. He or she thinks and acts economically with a minimum of effort and maximum effi­ciency. The warrior is of sound character because he or she learned to master willpower throughout training and knows how to distinguish between judgments based on emo­tion and those based on facts. Ideally, the magician is a technician without being a tech­nocrat, someone who,s mastered one's discipline to a tee, and who knows its legitimacy as well as its weaknesses, and he or she respects and admires one's trade and aU those who have learned it and are still learning. All of these qualities are rarely just handed to a person; they have to be acquired through hard work. Natural talents often tend to oversee these requiretnents and usually learn them the hard way by running into walls or through the painful process of mistakes and failure. But life is way too short anyway for any single person to completely cover the entire field of magic and the occult Time is running short, regardless of whether you,re eigh­teen or eighty! This causes a demand for didactic and pedagogical economy. We've taken this into account by only recommending exercises and procedures that are as versatile 16 What Is Magic?"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"and comprehensive as possible from an educational point of view. Put in more collo­quial terms, our exercises aim at killing as many birds as possible with only one stone. At the san1e tin1e, they're designed to train the will, develop the imagination, and provide access to controlled trance. For this reason, we'll avoid strictly dividing our training manual into the three sections (willpower, imagination, and trance) as might seem ap­propriate for our model. In the next section we,Il discuss this topic in depth. But for now we should be content with getting acquainted with the basic elements of magic listed here and thinking about them for awhile. Instead of holding you up (such as some magic authors like to do) for months, weeks, and years with exercises that seem to have no direct relationship to the practice of magic (which is often just a misjudgment by the beginner!), we'd like to introduce you to mag­ical practice right away with no major preparations. This means, however, that the exer­cises at the end of this section might seem to demand things from you that seem sheer impossible at first. But don't worry, everyone's in the same boat! Just do your best and al­ways remember that many things can only be accomplished through practice itself. TO KNOW, TO WILL, TO DARE, TO BE SILENT Before we go on to the practical part of this first section, we'd like to give you another maxim to think about that surfaces repeatedly in esoteric literature and is (rightly so) highly esteemed. \"To know, to will, to dare, to be silent'' is the challenge that's posed to oc­cultists. We only want to mention it briefly here, but it should serve for further meditation. To Know Without the knowledge of what we as magicians are doing, we,re not only aimless but we also run the risk of not recognizing the basic laws of our magical work, causing us to occasionally make some disastrous mistakes. However, there were times when this \"knowledge, was misunderstood or strongly overestimated. This doesn,t just mean pure intellectual knowledge, which is naturally also a part of it, and we'll be providing you with comprehensive information throughout this course as weJL But mainly it means intuition or that gut feeling from deep down inside that can only be achieved through personal experience. The most any teacher can do is show the student how to gain this kind of intuitive knowledge, but the student needs to go through the actual learning process him-or herself. What Is Magic? 17"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"To Will In the long run, a magician who doesn,t know what he or she wants is hopelessly des­tined to fail. Only an unyielding will (and an uncompromising desire, which is not the same!) can lead a magician safely to his or her goal. Actually, many modern-day magi­cians regard the ultimate goal of high magic to be the recognition of one,s own true will, or The lema. If the will begins to sway, the whole magical operation automatically strays off track as well. That's why mental training, or training of the will, always includes cog­nitive training and disciplining because every person is naturally inclined to act accord­ing to the pleasure principle whenever he or she has the opportunity. Although there,s principally nothing wrong with this, it often leads to negligence and convenience. This kind of person is quite successful in avoiding the conscious pursuit of one,s own will. To Dare This is probably the basic principal that has been violated most frequently throughout the history of magic. Countless pages written by authors of magic are filled with the utter fear of practice, as though they're afraid that magic could actually work! And it ac­tually does, although a magician can only be truJy efficient if he or she has the courage to stand up for what one will feel is necessary and worthwhile, in action as well as in thought. Please note that we,ve not yet said one word about the dangers of magic. Ifs not as though there aren,t any. But magic is actually no more dangerous than driving a car. Thorough training and diligent practice are the best prerequisites for successful, risk-free magical work. If a student driver is continuously filled with images of fear about how dangerous driving is, the only thing thafs accomplished is that he or she has been made into an intimidated, and therefore poorer, driver who even seems to attract accidents and bad driving habits. The same holds true for magicians. Watch out for the warnings of ((well-meaning, nonpractitioners who can already imagine you rotting in hell or an insane asylum just for reading about theoretical magic! Instead, you should listen to the more experienced \"journeyers to the East, and psychonauts who know ex­actly what dangers are actually real and which ones are just imagined (and that's most of them!). Think about the statement made by Martin Luther: \"A despairing ass will never produce a happy fart.\" Actually, the fear of magic itself is one of the greatest dangers a person will encounter on his or her magical path! For exactly these reasons, the impor­tance of confronting one,s own fears is not to be underestimated. 18 What Is Magic?"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"To Be Silent Lots of nonsense has been written in the past about the obligation to secrecy. Often this commandment was confused with the tendency to hide one's own uncertainty behind secretive insinuations (''I have to be silent about that,» ((True initiates will know what I mean,)' etc.). Sometimes occult knowledge was jealously guarded and intentionally with­held from the \"profane masses., But at the most, this is the behavior of a fossilized priesthood that's worried about maintaining its predominance founded merely on the ignorance of the people they ruJe. At worst, the main intention here is to lead the igno­rant astray so that they're easier to exploit. In reality, the mysteries protect themselves exceptionally well and ifs impossible to ((unveil'' them, because their actual \"secref' is contained in the experience that the initiate makes with them. These realms of experi­ence can never be taken away from the magician and can never be tarnished by an out­sider or an ignorant person. Nevertheless, it's advisable to not be all too open about your own occult interests as the prejudices that a magician encounters even in these modern times of \"enlightenment'' and \"tolerance, are still great, as is the energy wasted on de­fending oneself against such opposition. This defense ties up a lot of your power and should therefore be avoided whenever possible. Besides, if I aU ow myself to use another idiom, being silent also means \"putting a lid on the pot,\" meaning that by stoppering a bubbling cauldron, one creates the necessary amount of pressure to cook. This pressure is the magical power that we call magis. And now let's move on to practice. 1.

It serves various purposes: general protection, a part of a larger ceremony (usually as an introduction and conclusion), casting the protective circle, and an exercise to train the imagination as well as visualization, concentration, and trance skills. In short, the pentagram is an ancient symbol used in Western tradition to represent the five elements Earth, Water, Fire, Air, and Spirit (Ether).

Vis ualization while drawing the pentagrams and the circle: The hand used for drawing projects, like a laser, colored energy (bluish white, silver, or red), causing the pentagrams and circle to continuously radiate inside the room. The god-names should be vibrated as powerful as possible until \"the walls of the temple tremble,', as stated in old texts. This isn,t a question of volume. The temple is your body and the god-names should \"echo to the end of the universe)) in each direc­tion, penetrating e·verything in its path. 3. Invocation of the archangels/visualization of additional symbols As with the god-names., the names of the archangels should also be vibrated long and slow, making '<the walls of the temple tremble.'' Imagination/visualization while invoking the archangels: Raphael in the east rules the element of Air. He wears a yellow gown and carries a staff, and sometin1es an anointing pot. During the invocation, a light breeze from the east brushes your face. Gabriel in the west rules the element of Water. He wears a blue gown and carries a chalice while standing under a clear, flowing waterfall. You can hear the water splashing behind you in the west and can feel the moisture. Michael (or Mikael) in the south rules the element of Fire. He wears a bright red gown and carries a sword of fire. You can feel the heat to your right in the south. Auriel (or Uriel) in the north rules the element of Earth. He wears an earth-colored gown that's brown and olive green, and carries an ear of corn while standing in the mid­dle of a wheat field, perhaps on top of a pentacle. You can feel the firmness of the Earth to your left in the north. Imagine the hexagram above you in gold. Don't fo rget: Yo u visualize the pentagrams and the circle, hear the vibrated god-names, imagine yourself as a big black cross with a rose, and see/feel the archangels and ele­mental powers ... all at the same time! Don,t be disappointed if it takes you several months before you can do all of this properly. Practice makes perfect, and there,s no way of avoiding this unless you,re a natural.

Kabbalistic Cross Now repeat the Kabbalistic Cross according to step 1. 5. License to Depart For larger operations of ceremonial magic, the Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram is used as an introductory ritual for protection and casting the n1agic circle. Ifs repeated at the end of the operation to conclude the whole ritual. In this case, the second Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram is fo llowed by a li­cense to depart. This dismisses any beings (or disperses any distracting thoughts, associ­ations, and feelings) that might have been attracted by the ceremony. There,s no stan­dard license to depart, but it could be worded as fo llows: I now dismiss all spirits and energies that have been attracted to this ritual. Go in freedom may peace be with you and me! In the fo llowing part of these explanations, we want to discuss the individual parts of the Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram, the various aspects of its use, the logic be­hind the direction the lines are drawn, and more. Lefs begin the same way the ritual does, with the Kabbalistic Cross. I. The Kabbalistic Cross Regardless of any religious and cultural associations, the Kabbalistic Cross serves mainly two purposes: a) It gives the magician a feeling of inner harmony and centralization, and causes the balanced activation of his or her body's subtle energies. In this sense, it's sim­ilar to exercises we,re already fam iliar with from letter magic (Kerning, Kolb, Se­bottendorf), but from other cuJtures as well (such as the \"small circulation, of energy from chi kung or tao yoga). The importance of this function cannot be overemphasized! Sometimes just performing the Kabbalistic Cross on a regular basis is enough to promote he.aling, inner peace, and, above all, magical protec­tion. This can also be achieved through the second factor that will be discussed in 28 The Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pe ntagram"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"the next paragraph, and the experience of countless Western magicians has proven its extreme effectiveness. b) The statement it makes (((Thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory for­ever and ever, amen!',) strengthens the self-confidence and self-assurance of the magician, eliminating any fears' of n1agic that he or she might have while, on a tnetaphorical level, producing the certainty that can remove any destructive doubt about his or her own will. After all, '<thine\" refers to the magician directly, according to the ancient motto (( Deus est Homo, Homo est Deus'' (((God is Man, Man is God\"). Nonetheless, ifs not necessary to deliberately reflect on the meaning of these indi­vidual Hebrew mantras while vibrating the words (the same applies to the god-names). They work much stronger through sound, which is why it's so important to vibrate them out loud. Later with enough practice they)ll even work when you say them silently to yourself (for example, in look-alike magic). Drawing down the white light connects heaven and earth (kabbalistically speaking) inside the magician's body, making him or her a living symbol of the union of tradi­tional opposites, such as ''spirit/matter,, ((light/shadow,,, \"good/evil,)) \"solve/coagula,, (((disintegrate/unite,), or, in Eastern terms, \"yin/yang.,, Thus, the magician becomes the en1bodiment of the Hermetic law '<As above, so below., This abbreviated law is taken from the Emerald Plate of Hermes ·Trismegistos, which reads: {'That which is above is as that which is below, and that which is below is as that which is above, to perform the miracles of the One Thing.\" We realize that the Kabbalistic Cross alone offers enough material for contemplation to occupy the magician philosophically for a long period of time, which proves the value of well-considered, traditional symbolic acts. Nonetheless, from a metaphysical-mystical perspective, the practice itself should never be neglected, as it unfortunately has been for way too long with magic in the past and still is sometimes today. Such lack of symbol­logic can cause unconscious conflicts within the magician that question his or her mag­ical success in the material world (the concrete) as weU as the philosophical (the mysti­cal). If you want to join that which is above and that which is below, thought and actions must cooperate harmoniously. Empty speculation must also be avoided, as well as blind action without spiritual basis. The Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pe ntagram 29"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"2. The Pentagrams, the Protective Circle, and the God-Names Thoughts on the deeper symbolism of the pentagram alone could fi11 many pages. In the first part, we,ve already given you the essential information so that just a short summary is necessary here. The pentagram symbolizes, among other things, the five elements: Earth, Water, Fire, Air, and Spirit With this, it represents the material, earthly world, which our ancestors also called the <'sublunar, world (meaning ''located below the moon''). In the early days, the moon (and everything feminine) was considered to be the epitome of deception, seduction, and illusion (at least by the more patriarchal-influenced Western occultists). This led to the claim that there was such a thing as \"lower'' and \"higher\" magic. Nowadays, there are at least some open-minded magicians who won,t accept all the old nonsense without constructive criticism and view the situation a bit differently, thanks in part to modern psychoanalysis. They've realized that there's little use in overemphasizing one pole (e.g., the ''cosmic,\" \"divine,\" ''spiritual,\" or whatever you want to call it) at the cost of the other one. After all, magic is also art: on the one hand, the art of creating a certain balance; on the other hand, the art of removing it and replacing it with a new one.2 Knowing this, we're confronted with the pentagram. Just by drawing it, the penta­gram symbolically enables us to direct the energy of the elements fo r our use. This will become clearer in the third section of this book when we explain the direction the lines are drawn in connection with the Greater Ritual of the Pentagram. Just a word here in advance: Drawing the lines of the pentagram joins the elements with one another. On the tarot card I ('<The Magician,), the magician is usually portrayed standing at a table (or altar) while juggling the four elements represented by the wand (Fire), the chalice (Water), the sword (Air), and the pentacle (Earth). He can only manage this due to his inherent spirit, which is often represented (such as in the Golden Dawn tarot deck) by the lemniscate (a figure eight lying on its side, the symbol of infinity) thafs marked on his hat or floating above his head. In the end, performing magic simply means saying \"yes, to the sub lunar world of the elements. That's why the pentagram is the ultimate symbol of magic. By placing the fo ur pentagrams in the fo ur cardina1 directions (also called «corners;, a symbol that we'll dis­cuss later in this book) during a ritual, we acknowledge ourselves to be ('below, while at the same time putting the knowledge and (hopefully!) wisdom (e.g., True Will or 30 The Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pe ntagram"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"Thelema, gnosis) from uabove)) into action. This is our home; as already mentioned in the first section, we ourselves embody the pentagram when we stand with our arms and legs spread (think about Leonardo,s famous painting of the Vitruvian man!), and, when we mark our circle with pentagrams, protecting the circle with their harmony. Drawing the pentagrams is the practical application of the ((choreography of energy movements,,, which is a phrase sometimes used to define magic. The protective circle also plays a significant role in the practice of magic, which we just want to touch on here. The circle is the symbol of infinity since it has no beginning and no end. Inside the circle, the magician literally stands in his or her own center, in the middle of the circle, and in the middle of his or her own infinity.(At least the magician should be, in the ideal situation; in any case, he or she should strive for it.) Sometimes the circle is even drawn or visualized as a ball. The circle protects against unwanted external influences, but this doesn,t just happen automatically ; it occurs when the magician counters it with his or her own centeredness. The circle, therefore, is a symbol of concentration the tempo­rary switching off of everything thafs unnecessary and distracting. The magician draws his or her concentric circles from one,s own center and projects them into the world; the circle is one's symbolic microcosm, and the universe that the magician controls as its master and creator. But every universe is only as good as its creator! In this sense, the cir­cle is the magician,s incentive to pursue perfection, or at least the improvement of skills, knowledge, and wisdom. In practice, ifs not enough to just visualize or sense the circle, it should also be felt physically and it should be as noticeable as a brick wall. The magician should never leave one,s magic circle during a ritual, because that means he or she would be leaving one,s own center, which could cause horrible consequences, such as illness, confusion, or even insanity and physical death, depending on the type of energies that one is working with at the time. Compare leaving the circle to tinkering with a live power line: If you remove the protective isolation, you,re in deadly danger. Of course, the circle also protects against your own energies, especially those of your subconscious mind. In this sense, it works like a kind of projected censor and filter, so to speak. The circle is also permeable, but only for the powers intended and invoked. The Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram 31"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"The god-names vibrated in each of th·e fo ur cardinal directions have meanings of their own, but this is by fa r secondary to the mantric, vibratory significance. Nonethe­less, fo r better understanding, these meanings should at least be mentioned here briefly. JHVH (Jehovah or Yahweh) is generally translated as ''I AM WHO I AM,, the self-definition of the creator god from the book of Genesis. A god is a god, and man should view this fa ct as a challenge to be what he is as well. This can be com­pared to the recognition and pursuit of one's Tr ue Will (Thelema), the establish­ment of contact and dialog with one's Holy Guardian Angel, the realization of one's own destiny, and so on. Papus presented a comprehensive list of kabbalistic speculations about the relationship of the fo ur elements to each of the Hebrew let­ters of this \"unspeakable'' name of God, but this isn't the right place to go into de­tail on that. Another important fa ct to know is that JHVH is often referred to as the Te tragrammaton, which literally means «four--word, or as the \"four-letter name of God.\" ADNI (often written ADONAI) literally means «Lord, or ((my Lord.\" Generally it's also the name that an orthodox Jew reads aloud at the place in the holy scrip­tures when the Tetragrammaton is n1entioned, because one,s never aJlowed to say JHVH. EHIH (often written EHIEH) is translated as ''I will be., In the pentagram rit­ual, this represents the magician,s will. AGLA is not a word in itself, but rather an abbreviation fo rmed from the first letters of a whole sentence (a technique that's described in the Kabbalah as notari­con): ((Athath gibor leolam Adonai,,, which means «Thou art powerful and eternal, 0 Lord!, Once again, there are a number of mystical speculations related to this, most of which, of course, are based on Jewish occultism. The exact reason fo r this specific allocation of the god-names to the fo ur cardinal di ... rections or elements is unclear, especially since there are some discrepancies when com­pared to the Greater Ritual of the Pentagram, as we'll see later on in the section dealing with this. Above all, powerful vibration of the names is important since it enables quick access to their subtle energies, even for a magician who's not fa miliar with the Judea-Christian tradition. 32 Th e Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"3. The Invocation of the Archangels and the Visualization of Additional Symbols The cross that the magician visualizes (which is actually isosceles) is, an1ong other things, an ancient symbol for the union of the spiritual (vertical axis) and the material (horizontal axis), with the human being at its intersection. Here,s also where the rose of insight and wisdom blooms. But it's also the rose of silence, meaning the challenge to keep silent about one's royal art.3 Keeping silent is, as we've already seen, a very signifi­cant energy technique that serves to increase n1agical power, just like putting the lid on a pot of boiling water will create pressure and explode. By incorporating the ''cross of the world,\" the (silent) wisdom of perfection grows inside the initiate. One element of the Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagran1 usually causes prob­lems for non-Christian magicians: the invocation of the archangels. Now and then, the visualizations might seem like devotional kitsch to you, and some of you magicians who were raised as Catholics might think back in horror on those little pictures of guardian angels from your childhood. This is just one reason why attempts are often made at re­placing these figures. This would be easy to do since they mainly represent the elemen­tal powers, as already mentioned. If you like, you can replace them with other fo rmulas, such as \"I Call Upon Thee, 0 Powers of the East, 0 Powers of Air'' or ((0 Powers of the South, Powers of Fire.\" But this is, of course, an \"unorthodox'' version of the Lesser Ban­ishing Ritual of the Pentagram and, when working in a group with other magicians, you should first clear up the exact procedure you want to use. There's much to be said for personifying the elemental powers and making them. ap­pear as figures, even if you can't really appreciate the colorfulness that resembles A. E. Waite's tarot deck (which came much later, of course). After all, a large majority of cere­monial magicians work with such images. Through the contrast that the magician con­sciously creates internally and externally (e.g.) by projecting one's own images from deep inside), the subconscious mind can deal with such projected energies more skillfully. Surely a magician should always confront and analyze such ideological (symbolical) systems that are foreign to one's self, or those that he or she doesn,t understand or even abhors. That's one of the best ways to learn, and it releases magical energy as well. The Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram 33"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"The names of the archangels have certain meanings or associations as well, which don't always correspond to the archangels, functions in the Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram. In order of their invocation: RAPHAEL \"The Healer of God,\" which is why he,s sometimes associated astrolog­ically and astromagically with Mercury. GABRIEL \"The Mighty One of God,; in the gnostic speculations he's often associ­ated with the spirit as the bringer of life, or the logos. MICHAEL ((Who is like God?,; guardian angel of the Jewish people, aJso called the (( Sword of God'' (or of the Demiurge); Michael was also the figure who expelled Adam and Eve from paradise after eating from the Tr ee of Knowledge. AURIEL <'The Fire of God,; also one of the important angels. Consider the fa ct that the fo rmula EL (or AL) has always played an important role in magical literature. This is a Hebrew term fo r \"God,\" and as an ending it means \"divine'' or \"of God.>' The well-known formula ELOHIM that we'll run into later is the plural form. Strictly speaking, it means ((gods,, a fact that's quite significant in Jewish and gnostic traditions to the never-ending debate about monotheism. Is there only one \"God,, or many? It's also significant in our magical dealings with god-forms, especially in planetary magic. Lastly, we still need to mention that the radiant pentagrams are strengthened through visualization, and (this is new) that the hexagram is also visualized or imagined above the magician,s head. While the pentagram represents the five elements, and there­fore the \"sublunar,, world mentioned earlier, the hexagram portrays, among other things, the \"astral, world. This is understood to be the sphere of stars (Latin astrum, plural astra), which is why each of the six points also corresponds to one of the seven planets of classical astrology. (The sun, being the central planet, is located in the middle of the hexagram.) The hexagram is also a symbol for the fusion of the cosmic polarities ((male, (upward-pointing triangle) and ((female\" (downward-pointing triangle); in this respect, it can be seen as a counterpart to the oriental yin�yang symbol (also caUed '<monad,). As the '(Key (or Seal) of Solomon,\" the hexagram is a traditional symbol of magic just like the pentagram. Through its visualization, the magician is aware that he or she is not only working in the transient world of the elements (which are «merely\" a 34 The Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagrarn"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"I • • product of primeval duality), but, more importantly, that one's using the cosmic pri­mary powers as well. Plus, it reminds the magician that one doesn,t have to \"carry the cross, alone according to the laws of the material world. The hexagram could also be seen as a sort of <<magical beacon\" pointing the way toward higher insight and wisdom that the magician uses to illuminate the path that one follows. We can see from this analysis (which is still quite short, even though we seem to have covered many details) that the Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram is actually a lit­tle summa summarum, or usummary,,, of Western ritual symbolism a sort of \"Encyclo­pedia of Symbols in Action., After al l, we should never forget this aspect, regardless of all the fun we're having speculating and theorizing about the symbolism; the golden rule of Western magic is to recognize the symbol, be able to experience it, and use it in a practi­cal sense ··all at the same time! Only then can your head and hand work together to at­tain spiritual and physical totality and healing (from ccheal, or uto be whole\"), which is the highest goal for nearly aU magicians of the Western tradition (even if other words are often used to describe this goal ... ). PRACTICAL EXERCISES The Importance of the Magical Diary The results of magical operations should always be monitored. This prevents self-decep­tion and delusion while at the same time assuring the precise and accurate estimate of one's own strengths and weaknesses. The means for this monitoring is your magical diary. If you don't have one yet, get yourself a thick, stable notebook to use only for your magical work. You should make daily entries, even if you happen to neglect your training program on occasion! Then you would write why you were \"lazy., By the way, in your magical diary you shouJd even record your thoughts relating to magic, e.g., about the magical literature that you may have read, or questions that you can,t follow up on until later. Leave plenty of room for adding entries and comments at a later date. Ne ver underestimate the importance of your magical diary. Otherwise, you'll soon learn the hard way through practice. Consider your magical diary to be a \"reality an­chor'' that prevents you from losing control and drifting away.

EXERCISE 2 KABBALISTIC CROSS � Pra�tice the Kabbalistic Cross three times a day for a week. Preferably you • should do this right after getting up in the morning, or right after taking a bath or shower, while your body,s still wet. During the exercise, make sure your face is directed toward a light source (natural or artificial); this will help you feel the light's energy stronger and absorb it easier. However, you don't need to actually concentrate on the light. While practicing, pay at­tention to how your body feels. 36 The Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram •"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"If you can't work without being disturbed, you can even do the exer­cise in the bathroom at work during your lunch break; just vibrate the mantras softly, but powerfully.

Even if you're already familiar with sigil magic, I recommend that you study the following in-• fo rmation closely and integrate it into your magical practice. This will help prevent you from getting on the wrong track, which can rob quite a bit of your time. In the last section, we mentioned one of the basic formulas of magic: WILL, IMAG­INATION, and TRANCE. This formal structure enables us to understand our magical work better, and allows us to derive and apply many of the laws of magic from our own understanding. Now let's take a practical approach. You already know that the censor, the authority that all-too-often makes life as a magician difficult for us with its pseudo-rational doubts and objections, is located between the conscious and subconscious minds. This censor can be averted entirely (or at least in part) through the means of trance. Magical power lies in the subconscious mind. If we can succeed in \"smuggling', commands or statements of intent past the conscious mind to the subconscious n1ind, our experience has shown that this enables the desired result to manifest within the scope of one,s pow-ers (which are actually quite tremendous). • 39"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"The desire to achieve a specific thing automatically generates the opposite effect, namely fa ilure, according to the law of actio et reactio. The fa ct that we're usually un­aware of this countereffect doesn't change the situation. Our psyche has learned to clev­erly disguise it in many ways: doubts, fe ar, moral or religious concerns, uncertainty, and yes, even the plain old fe ar of success itself, which is rarely admitted. These are the man­ifestations of this anti-energy. «All suffering stems from desire;' said Buddha. This defi­nitely applies to the magical level as well until we've learned to make the distinction be­tween desire and will. But this isn't always as simple as it sounds, so we'll start by using the more straightforward method of directing our desires straight to their destination by means of magical technology. People who are not strong enough to fa ce their opponent openly in battle need to use cunning and camouflage. Consequently, we disguise our desires and statements of intent, enabling them to march right by the \"palace guard�, namely our censor un­hindered, straight to the armory of our inner soul. The best way to do this is to give them a \"harmless, disguise that hides their true intentions, such as through the use of abstract images and glyphs (symbols) that we call ((sigils.', Now you might object and think that all the effort isn,t really necessary if you just use the technique of suggestion. In fa ct, such techniques (e.g. Coueism, positive think­ing, self-hypnosis) often ·do work quite well. These techniques are no strangers to magic and are often applied as helpful tools, but they shouldn't be confused with magic itself! Anyway, if you take a closer look, you'll see that these systems are really not as <'simple\" as they may seem at first, and that their rate of success rarely even comes close to that achieved though sigil magic. Let's look at a concrete example. You,d like to make a good impression on an impor­tant person, such as during a job interview. Now by using autosuggestion, positive thinking, or similar systems, you'd prepare yourself for the interview by suggesting to . yourself several times a day that you'll make the desired good impression and get the job. Depending on the situation and your talent, this would require at least five to ten minutes of work a day for several days in a row maybe even fo r weeks or months. On the other hand, with sigil magic, you can achieve the same goal (provided that you have some experience) with a minimun1 amount of effort applied just once fo r about fifteen 40 Practical Sigil Magic (I)"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"minutes and with a much higher success rate, as proven. Afterward you never have to think about it again; in fa ct, you're even required to fo rget! But the minimum of time and effort involved isn't the only advantage of sigil magic. This is truly an organic method through and through, and we really mean that literally: Austin Osman Spare, the founder of sigil magic, once said, \"Sigils will flesh., They be­come an integral part of the human organism, which, in turn, applies all of the strength and power available in every one of its cells to convert them. into action. Later on we'll discuss what this actually means and apply in practice as well by using the example of atavistic magic. Everything that we enter into our subconscious mind is processed there: Facts, expe­riences, and associations are stored; uncomfortable thoughts are repressed and, as a re­sult, can even become a tremendous explosive force (such as a complex, neurosis, or even psychosis). In magic, the function of the conscious mind is to define the predeter­mined goal, acting as a sort of((pilot.)) It's cultivated through spiritual training and exer­cises in concentration, discipline, and will. The subconscious mind, on the other hand, has the responsibility of converting the commands and goals as promisingly as possible, acting as the \"engineer.\" Ifs trained through ritual and association/analogies (more on this later), through trance training as well as through the use of symbols. The censor is assigned the function of protecting the entire process, keeping every­thing \"running, and eradicating any undesired internal or external fa ctors. It's the \"duty officer.'' Since at first it will more likely cause difficulties rather than stimulate our mag­ical ambitions due to its ultraconservative and overcautious .attitude thaes additionally .. strengthened through a magic-hostile environment and upbringing, it will be evaded and \"re-educated'' by working with the gnostic or magical trance. Experience has shown that it will eventually come to terms with our magic, becoming a valuable ally that takes over a large part of our work on the robotic or automatic level while also providing ef­fective magical protection. Once the magician is able to merge it with his or her True Will (Thelema) through constant practice, it will become its embodiment, therefore ful­filling the function of what is referred to as the \"Holy Guardian Anger, in the Magic of Abramelin, or the ((clan totem\" in African magic (as well as in other so-called ((primitive, systems of native peoples).

In practice, using the example from above, you would first for­mulate your statement of intent, then convert it into a glyph or sigil by means of graph­ical manipulation, and then charge this sigil, implanting it into your subconscious mind through gnostic trance. Here,s a detailed description of how that works .. THE PRACTICE OF SIGIL MAGIC (I) THE WORD METHOD Before we get to the actual practice of sigil magic, we first need to state our intention. At first, we'll only be dealing with the so-called '<word method,, of sigil magic, but later we'll be dealing with other techniques as welL The Statement of Intent and its Formulation The word method of sigil magic is based on a distinctly formulated «statement of in­tent.)) This should be worded as clearly and precisely as possible because the subcon-42 Practical Sigil Magic (I)"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"scious mind has the fa tal tendency to interpret some commands way too literally. Let me tell you about a real situation that happened to one of our seminar participants once since his example illustrates this principle quite well here,s his report: A colleague from work is a passionate horseman who oft en participates in tourna­ments and competitions. We ll, there was one riding competition that he was particu­larly interested in, and it was his dream to win it at least once in his lifetime. Since he was Jamiliar with the technique of positive thinking, he used an affi rmation that was worded as fo llows: \"I will win the tournament. I will win the tournament., He re­peated this several times a day. Finally the big day arrived and he participated in the tournament just as planned. Although he tried his best, he only crossed the finish line fo urth. Now, imagine how baffled he was when he received his consolation prize an aft ershave called \"Tourna­ment''! Yo u co uld almost hear the universe laughing out loud ... • Now be honest, did you ever think this situation would turn out the way it did? Probably not! After all, this example can teach us a lesson in more ways than one. Firstly, it shows how careful we need to be when fo rmulating our magical statements of intent in order to avoid misunderstandings. Secondly, we realize how literal the subconscious mind understands some commands and how it may cause ((coincidences, to occur in order to obey these (misunderstood) commands. Thirdly, it illustrates the principle of \"success on another lever' in which we often just barely «miss the point,\" being not even able to count it as a true fa ilure since the instructions were officially carried out. All ex­perienced magicians are fa miliar with this phenomena and, after all, this is what often makes magic so colorful and surprising. The reason we often just hit scattered targets in­stead of the desired <<direct shots'' will be discussed more closely in the next section when we deal with the ((symbol-logical fuzzy relation.,, On the other hand, the statement of intent shouldn,t be overly precise. A statement like '< I want to win exactly $7527.24 on March 14 in the lottery\" is loaded with too many specific commands to have any hopes of success. AJthough such formulations just may actually work sometimes, it only happens in spite of the formulation and certainly not because of it!

However, as a rule of thumb, you �an note that your statement of intent should be clear and precise. ''Clear'' means that you should eliminate any ambiguities. If you say \"I want to get rich,, this includes the possibility of winning the lottery, but also the possibility of your favorite aunt passing away and you inheriting her house or you getting ((rich in experience,'' for exa·mple, by fa lling for a trickster who talks you into buying «dead certain'' stock in an Australian gold mine that turns out to be not even worth the paper ifs printed on ...

If you use a statement of intent such as ((I want to do well,\" this spell may or may not bear fruit in any case, ifs questionable as to whether or not you'd even notice the effect.

We recommend always starting your statement of intent with the sa me phrasing, such as \"I will ... \"or '' It is my will to ... \"This conditions your subconscious mind the more you practice and trains it to automatically activate every time a new sigil is charged. Avoid the following when formulating your statement of intent: a) Negative fo rmulations these are usually ignored by the subconscious mind and therefore turned into just the opposite.

Charg­ing sigils for \"world peace'' or \"wiping out international terrorism, is a sheer over­estimation of your abilities.

After you've followed our directions to make your first sigil, take the time to read through our instructions once again before you start charging it. Let's take an example from everyday or practical magic: \"I will make eight hundred dollars tomorrow.\" (Make sure you set a time span this will make it easier for you to monitor the results later.) First, write your statement of intent in block letters on a piece of paper: I WILL MAKE EIGHT HUNDRED DOLLARS TOMORROW• Now cross out all of the letters that are repeated each time a repetition occurs. Each letter is only used once. I Wxxl MAKE xxGHT xUNDRxx xOxxxxS The letters that remain are: I, W, L, M, A, K, E, G, H, T, U, N, D, R, 0, S, Now we make a sigil using these letters: • Illustration 4: The first sigil You see that we've made a little picture by lining up the letters on top of each other.

Nonetheless, it still contains all of the letters from the list above, even if we've used a little trick. One line can be part of several letters at the same time, and the letters count even when they,re upside down. That way, the arch can be used for the U and the D at the same time, as shown in Il lustration 4; in the same way, the remaining letters can easily be found in the finished sigil as welL In Illustration 6, we've also shown the letters K, G, S, and Min order to clari fy the whole process better. You can even decorate the sigil a bit if you want to give it a n1ore ((magical') appear­ance, as in Illustration 7 below. Illustration 7: The decorated sigil The decorative circles and triangles used have no meaning in themselves and serve the sole purpose of giving the finished sigil a medieval-like appearance. Making sigils re­quires no artistic talent whatsoever; in fact, they,re often more effective when they,re \"homemade,,, awkward, or primitive-looking since experience has shown that the sub­conscious mind rather associates with primeval instincts and energies. In time you,ll de­velop your own unmistakable style of making sigils, although every sigil should still be uniquely individual in order to prevent confusion with other ones. The finished product is a glyph that has no detectable meaning. Try letting friends examine your finished test sigil to see if they can determine which letters it contains. As explained earlier, just crossing out the extra letters is a way of coding the statement of intent, and the graphic depiction continues this process. Through coding, the conte.nts of the magical statement of intent are smuggled past the psychological censor unde­tected so that it cannot erect any barriers or blockades and the subconscious mind can tackle the job unhindered. In summary, the word method of creating sigils proceeds according to the following scheme: 48 Practical Sigil Magic (I)"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"Write down the statement of intent in block letters. Cross out the letters that appear more than once. Create a graphic sigil using the remaining letters. Simplify and decorate the sigil, making it more abstract. Chart 6: Making a sigil (word method) That's all you need to know for now about this method of making sigils. This is plenty of information to get you started. Experience has shown that this method will lead to ex­cellent results as long as you heed our advice contained in this section. Charging the Sigil Charging a sigil that was made using the word method is done in a spasmodic (convul­sive or jerky) way. It involves exertion and there are many methods for storing the en­ergy required for this. Austin Osman Spare recommended the so-called \"death posture, to charge a sigil, al­though he failed to describe this in detail. Nowadays, most practitioners have agreed that the goal of the death posture is to achieve a complete state of empty mind. Once this is achieved, the sigil can be charged and implanted into the subconscious mind. Please note that the word ''charge, in relation to sigil magic means something en­tirely different than the energizing of talismans and amulets. In the latter, n1agical en­ergy is di rected into an object (sometimes spasmodic as well), which turns it into astor­age medium fo r this polarized power. The charging of a sigil, on the other hand, can be compared to a computer program that's loaded or stored into the memory of the com­puter. In other words: A sigil is charged by implanting it into the subconscious mind. Metaphorically, you could compare it to a cartridge that's loaded into the chamber of a revolver. It's important to keep this difference in mind, otherwise it may lead to fu­ture n1isunderstandings. This is why we'll be using the ph rase \"to activate', from now on . • Practical Sigil Magic (I) 49"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"• Principally it doesn't matter which form of the death posture you choose for activat ... ing your sigils. The important thing is that you can adequately achieve a state of empty mind. The term \"death posture', refers to the ''death\" of all thoughts; for the same rea­son, an orgasm is sometimes called \"little death.\" This death of all mind activity is ac­companied by a temporary dissolving of self-awareness (ego). The phrase ''state of empty mind\" has caused quite a sensation in esoteric literature in the past, and it's considered the ult in1ate goal of all yoga techniques and other Eastern forms of mediation. But it would throw us way too far off course to delve into such questions now, e.g., whether samadhi yoga or satori in Zen Buddhism are possibly noth­ing more than the temporary shutting-off of the thought process and self-awareness­something which their followers strictly deny. For now it's fine if you can just imagine the state of empty mind being comparable to a moment of extreme anger or joy a state in which the entire outside world is either concentrated into one single thing or disappears entirely, and no thoughts about one,s own identity can exist. The best way to achieve this state of mind is through physical stress, which is emphasized by the first of the fo llowing two techniques for activating sigils. The Death Posture (1)3 The magician can either stand or sit. The sigil is either hung on the wall or placed on the table in front of one's self, clearly visible. The magician takes a deep breath and closes one's mouth, eyes, ears, and nostrils using the fingers of both hands. Then he or she holds one's breath until it's nearly unbearable. But one doesn't let go yet he or she keeps holding one,s breath. While doing so, he or she should think neither about the sigil nor its purpose. Then just before fainting one opens the eyes as wide as possible and stares at the sigil while exhaling and refilling one's lungs with fresh air. Then the ma­gician abruptly closes the eyes again and banishes the sigil (see section ((Banishing the Sigil, further below). Another option is to stare at the sigil while standing on your tiptoes, holding your arms in an un natural, unc omfortable position twisted and turned behind your back, and leaning back so far that you can just barely keep your balance.• • • • 50 Practical Sigil Magic (I)"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"• The Death Posture (II) This version of the death posture is much milder than the first, but works just as well when done with the proper intensity. However, it requires a bit more practice. It should : be performed while sitting and is well suited fo r people with heart or breathing problems. • • The sigil is placed on a table in front of the magician, who sits up straight and places one,s hands on the tabletop around the sigil. The thumbs fo rn1 a ninety-degree angle, the hands lie flat on the table with the tips of the thumbs touching, and the sigillies in the open square fo rmed by the hands (see Illustration 8). Stare at the sigil with yo ur eyes wide open; don't blink or close your eyes, even when they start running. Now the magician starts twitching muscles one by one, starting with a lower leg, then the next, then both at the same time. This twitching should be firm and relaxed; it should only take a split second, but needs to be very intense. Then the magician co ntin­ues by twitching the upper legs in the same way, then the buttocks, hands, arms, and fi­nally even the scalp. After practicing a few times, twitching the whole body should only take about a half a second. At the clim.ax of twitching, the magician rips open the eyes even fu rther while still staring at the sigil; then, he or she abruptly closes the eyes and banishes the sigil (see ''Banishing the Sigil,). Banishing the Sigil After activating the sigil, it needs to be banished this is the first step in fo rgetting the entire operation. The easiest way of banishing is to let out a loud, hearty laugh. At first your laugh will probably seem a bit fa ke, but that doesn't matter. Actually, laughing is one of the most uncomplicated ways of achieving a state of empty mind, as mentioned above.� In addition, the magician should distract oneself from the magical operation by con­centrating on something profane. The less it has to do with magic, the better. Activities like watching TV, playing con1puter gan1es, or exercising are all good methods of dis-• traction. The \"channel, leading to the subconscious mind that was opened through trance needs to be closed again completely after charging the sigil. It would be entirely wrong to medi­tate after charging a sigil, like some of my students did at first.

Therefore, when we open ourselves up through trance in order to i:mplant our sigil into our subconscious mind, we need to close this opening as soon as we,re finished so that no energy can escape.

If the magician is constantly reminded of its s·bape and contents, the rational mb1d will interfere with the process and endanger the opetario-n with ,doubt. curiosity, or impatience.

Ritual par­ticipants can witness and actively participate in mythological themes such as the life, death, and reincarnation of the sun god Osiris, or the union of Simon and Helena by \"staging\" them symbolically or allegorically in a temple or sanctuary (be it with or with­out an audience) within a more or less fixed ritual structure. However, the difference from an ordinary drama is that rituals are not designed fo r entertainment or amuse­ment, and not much in1portance is placed on aesthetics and philosophical contempla­tion; rather, they,re aimed at fulfilling a specific and concrete purpose, whether mystical or with intentions of magical success. This realization also has many important consequences fo r both ritual and non ritual magic. Yo u've heard of magic being called the \"art of illusion., Well, this includes much more than just stage entertainment where virgins are apparently sawed into pieces and then brought back to life and rabbits are pulled out of apparently empty top hats. A ma­gician is a n1aster of i1lusion. He or she sees through things, learns the taws of nature, uses them to one,s advantage, and fo rces reality to comply with them. Of course that docsn,t mean that a magician,s results are merely ((imagined,\" or based on optical or 55"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"other perceptional illusions. Actually, the effects of magic are no less real and concrete than our reality as a whole, even though they may be more difficult to grasp and detect. You could compare it to working with microbes. The unaided (in magic, ''untrained,) eye is unable to see n1 icroorganisms (in magic, ((magical energies and effects,,) and can­not even confirm their existence; but with the help of microscopes and the proper train­ing (in magic, ''the training of perception and intuition',), we're able to do this. There­fo re, our view of reality is dependent on the way we perceive things. Please note that we're talking about the way we perceive things and not the precision with which we perceive things. Only materialistic scientists would do the latter because they represent the ideology that in the end everything in the universe is measurable and therefore perceptible with our five normal senses, if science would just make sufficient progress. Even the supposedly accurate and unerring measuring instruments that scien­tists use are nothing n1ore than extended human sensory organs. Actually this is nothing but a change in our current fo rm of perception. One of the goals of a magicaJ education should therefore be the training of one's magical perception. In this sense, we can apply the above-mentioned concept that (ritual) magic is also \"sacred theater,\" or a ((mystery game.'' The proof can be fo und in the basic structure of the subconscious mind that if\"pretending, is practiced frequently enough, it will cause the desired real effect on a material or conscious level. We're all familiar with a negative exan1ple of this. If you keep telling yourself that no one likes you or tha� you,re a ridicu­Jous loser and have nothing but bad luck in dealing with other people (such as with the opposite sex, but also with colleagues, superiors, and so on), you'll indeed become the ki nd of person that you insist you already are: Yo u,ll become a person that no one likes with absolutely no attractive charisma. The same holds true if you keep insisting on fa il­ure (\"I won't get the job,,, \"I'll never pass that test!,, \"No woman/man could ever put up with me,). Psychology calls this a ((self-fulfilling prophecy.\" Techniques of autosuggestion, such as positive thinking and working with affirma­tions or self-hypnosis, prove that this method works in a positive way as well, meaning that a constructive opposite can also be achieved. This is usually not clear enough to beginning students of magic. When practicing the Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram, if you fe el that the complicated visualizations of this basic ritual just don't seem to work despite all your efforts, remember the fo llow­ing basic principle: 56 Introduction to Ritual Magic (I)"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"Anything that you cannot actually perceive during the visualization must either be imag­ined or accepted as reality until you are able to do so! This means moving away from older magic authors such as Bardon, Crowley, or Gregorius who usually place great importance on perfect visualization before actually perfortning a magical operation. However, modern practice has shown that this is noth­ing but an extremely time-consuming misunderstanding. In reality ifs fine (at least fo r the start) to just accept a visualization as being real (even if you can't ('really, perceive it) in order to achieve the desired effect. In other words, your Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram will protect you even if you,rc not able to sec the archangels with all of their colorful details as long as you practice it frequently enough and, in this way, program your '(magical database)' or ((the subconscious, to asso-ciate this ritual with protection as well as inner and outer centering.' Often, the beginner will stand in the circle, perforn1 the ritual correctly (meaning ac­cording to the instructions), and merely hope that the pentagrams are actually flaming around him, the god-names are ((echoing to the end of the universe,\" and that all of the • archangels as guardians of the elements are present. Only after practicing fo r awhile which can take days or years, depending on how talented you are will the actual effect take place. Yo u,ll be able to perceive the visual­ized symbols, figures, mantras, and so on with the same reality that you perceive things in the everyday world. Then the magician will instinctively fe el a physical touch if one accidentaJly brushes with the boundaries of the '< imaginary\" circle a sure indication that his or her subtle perception has developed well. This is the largest obstacle that needs to be overcome, and then ifs just one more small step until you can perceive the magical energy of other people. From now on we're going to call this �'magical energy perception,: or simply C(energy perception.\" At first, energy perception is developed by means of a trick, namely by declaring its reality without actually being able to perceive it. We can derive a theory from this that can be applied to all aspects of magical practice that you should definitely remember: The art of magical illusion is achieved by fo rcefu lly and repeatedly declaring illusions to be reality until they have actually become reality. Introduction to RitrJal Magic (I) 57"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"Notice that the concepts of fo rce and repetition are stressed here. Fact is, the subcon­scious n1ind is a creature of habit that mainly learns through repetition. First the length of practice is of importance, fo llowed of course by the respective energy input required. Such a process can be understood as the creative fo rmation of one,s own universe. After all, rituals also serve the purpose of creating this magical illusion by setting \"re .. ality markers�' through moven1ent, analogies, and even the initial process stages of imi­tation and acting out, regardless of whether we prefer to establish these in the magician,s psyche or on the astral plane. Ifs often said that rituals work like <'astral beacons,, at­tracting nonincarnate entities (beings) like moths to a light. This is one important rea­son fo r saying the license to depart after every ritual (not only after the Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pe ntagram). Even if you don't happen to believe in the hypothesis (and ifs really no more than such) of nonincarnate entities (although most magicians do, with some exceptions), there,s good reason to assutne that every ritual leaves behind tracks in the deepest layers of the psyche. The more psychologically minded magician might argue that subcon­scious, often repressed soul material is activated by the ritual and therefore needs to be banished afterwards to prevent it from getting out of control and taking possession of the n1agician. ''VISUALIZATION'' AND MAGICAL SENSORY PERCEPTION The term '�visualization,, as con1monly used in magical literature has often led to misun­derstandings. Maybe the fo llowing sentence will shatter all your well-loved prejudices (or misjudgments), and your own practice will surely convince you that ifs correct: Magical sensory and energy perception does not occur through any of the known sensory organs. The theories about the \"third eye, or other postulated subtle organs that are often used to explain magical perception still do not change this fa ct. In no way do we want to deny the existence of the third eye but ifs useless to start off by identifying it with the thymus gland, only to later switch it to the mysterious pineal gland, and finally to switch it to some other center, which is exactly what the history of magic has done. And it's non­sense to believe that such models couJd actually help the training of magical perception. 58 Introduction to Ritual Magic (I) • • •"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"The concept of the third eye has led to the fact that magic has been reduced to opti­cal perception only throughout the centuries, when in reality it's quasi-optical at the most and, in addition, represents only one of many methods of magical perception. Mter all, clairvoyance doesn't just involve seeing, but also smelling, hearing, tasting, and feeling. But all of these terms are merely just vague approximations for a form of per­ception that really resembles more of a <'sensing, than seeing, hearing or feeling. Only a small minority of magicians and other sensitive people are able to perceive things equally well with aU of these senses, even if this is desired in the int erest of higher accu­racy and the refore trained as such. In reality, although subtle perception is articulated in a way that may seem to resemble other forms of sensory perception, it' s not identical to these and they should in no way be confused. Although magical perception usually takes place on a quasi-optical level for most people meaning that they seem to actually '<see\" the subtle energies there are count­less exceptions. In fact, many magicians are extremely nonvisual types and cannot really visualize anything at aU. But that doesn,t mean that they,re poor representatives of their trade; it only means that they're skilled in other things and may be able to smell, taste, or feel the subtle energies instead. But if you insist on focusing your training on optical perception for experiencing subtle energies like most magical literature does, those of you that could reach the same results with other forms of perception will have unneces­sary difficulties. In other words, if you have the feeling that you can't really \"visualize, properly, just try using another form of perception in stead. Don,t force yourself to ((see, the magical circle or the pentagrams at all costs; try to \"feel, them with your hands instead, or to ((smell,\" ''taste,,, and even \"hear, them. For example, a visually oriented person will find it hard to imagine how one could differentiate between a red triangle or yellow square by simply \"smelling\" it, but for a ((nose\" or olfactory person this wouldn't be any prob­lem at all. An auditory person, on the other hand, can \"hear,, the difference between var­ious colors and symbols, and the haptic person can \"feel, it. So if you should happen to run across the word \"visualization, in other books on magic, just replace it with the word \"magical imagination,, and concentrate on the <'sen­sory organ\" that works best for you at first. Later, of course, you should train the other forms of perception as well since this would expand your entire range of perception, al­lowing more information to be taken in and pr ocessed, which would result in greater Introduction to Ritual Magic (I) 59"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"flexibility in decision-making and a larger variety of possible outcomes.

PRACTICAL EXERCISES EXERCISE. 4 PRACTICAL SIGIL MAGIC (1) Perform at least one operation of sigil magic per week fo r three months according to the instructions in this section using the word method. Enter the operation into your magical diary, but cover up the sigil after activat­ing it by taping a sheet of paper to the sides so that you won't accidentally see and deactivate it when paging through the diary. Don,t fo rget to write a date on this cover-up sheet that tells you when to monitor the success or failure of the operation. Here it's extremely important to leave room in your magical diary fo r later entries, which should be dated as well . EXERCISE 5 TRAINJNG OF MAGICAL PERCEPTION (1) This exercise is practiced alongside the Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pe n­tagram. During the first month of practice, you should perform the entire exercise at least twice a week. On each of the other five days you can do one of the five steps of the exercise (letters a, b, c, d, or e) after performing the pentagram ritual. In doing so, during the first month you should pay close attention that you really do practice each individual step equally without putting more emphasis on a certain one. During the second month, it's enough to just do the entire exercise at least twice per week. After the third month, just do the exercise whenever (and as often as) you fe el necessary. If you notice that your magical per­. ception is improving from this exercise (and that will most likely be the case), try intensifying things fo r awhile by extending the length and dura­tion of the exercise.

Try not to visualize or imagine the circle in any way when doing so this won)t be necessary at all, even if you don't have much success at first. Usually you'll sense the subtle energies as a soft tingling fe eling, or a fe eling of warmth or cold, or maybe you,ll even fe el a slight electrical shock. Carefully note all of your perceptions in yo ur magical diary. b) Proceed as in step a) except that you'll work with the sense of hear­ing this time. While walking around the circle., first try hearing each of the god-names that you vibrated in the corresponding direc­tions. (Keep silent while doing this; don,t try to help your percep­tion by vibrating the names again.) Then stand in the middle of the circle and try to hear all of the god-names at the same time, each one echoing fron1 its corresponding direction.

First, in combination with the fo llowing Exercise 6, you'll get a good idea of where your strengths lie concerning subtle en­ergy perception. These are not necessarily identical to your strengths in your everyday perception. That way, a generally auditory, or even musical, person might ((smell'' or \"see', magical energy better than he or she can hear it, while an extraordinarily haptic person, on the other hand, might find out that he or she can \"hear, or ((taste'' better when it comes to magic. EXERCISE 6 TRAINING OF MAGICAL PERCEPTION (11) After practicing the previous exercise at least fo ur times in its complete fo rm and the short version just as frequently, answer the fo llowing ques­tion in your magical diary directly after completing the full version of the • exercise: 1.

But if the instructions say ((Visualize a ball of energy above the circle,\" this clearly means that you need to use yo ur quasi .. optical sense of perception. EXERCISE 7 PRACTICAL DREAM WORK (I) Working with your dreams is a particularly effective way of training and expanding your magical perception because the specific attention you pay to your subconscious mind flatters it, making it more willing to help you with your magical efforts. In addition, working with dreams helps im­prove your trance control, divination skills, astral travel, and several other magical practices, in particular those of a shamanistic nature. Let's start very basic and concentrate on simply remembering our dreams. If you've never worked with your dreams before, you might think that this would be extremely difficult, but thafs definitely not the case. AU you need is a little patience and son1ething to write with next to yo ur bed and then you're ready to go! Before fa lling asleep, tell yourself that you,ll remember your dreams in the morning. (You can support this work by making an appropriate sigil.) At first you should keep this thought firmly in mind while falling asleep, allowing it to sink into your subcon­scious mind. When you wake up, don't move fo r a few minutes until you can recall your dreams as well as possible. Then write down your impressions using short keywords. Yo u can also use drawings and sketches to record certain impressions; sometimes this will give you a much more precise impression of the energy and intensity of the dream than a description in words could ever achieve, no matter how detailed it may be.

You can even make notes in the dark if you don't want to wake up completely, as long as you write legibly. Instead of writing down yo ur dream right away, you can speak it onto a tape recorder that you keep next to your bed. This has the great advantage that you can record more details in a shorter period of time, and much more realistically than by writing. Of course, the disadvantage is that ifs fa irly time-consuming to listen to the tape later on and write everything down (which is absolutely necessary fo r later review and comparison). Keep a separate diary fo r recording your dreams; don,t record them in your magical diary. As you get better you,ll notice that you'll be writing more and more, and your magical diary will literally be overflowing with dream work. (There will come a time when you,ll consciously try not to remember your dreams, but we'll get to that later.) Only if your dreams are directly related to a magical operation should you additionally write parts of your dream in your magical diary. Often ifs enough to just make a cross- reference to the corresponding page in your dream diary. It's possible that you may not have any luck at all in recalling yo ur dreams during the first fe w days or even weeks. This problem can only be solved with persistence. Keep trying every single night and you're sure to succeed someday! You might even discover that your magical activities will cause you to dream much more vividly. That's a good sign since it reflects the growing willingness of yo ur subconscious mind to cooperate. FURTHER READING Let's keep the cross-references to other useful books to the bare minimum. After all, even the most ambitious and well-meaning magician just doesn,t have the time to weed through hundreds of other books pa rallel to working through this one.

The question as to whether magical phenomena are actually projections of our own in­ternal abilities and powers, or might be caused by the influence of nonhuman beings (spirits, demons, astral beings, or the like) has interested parascience for decades. The principle that supports a more psychological explanation and believes that everything magical arises from deep inside the magician's soul itself is called anin1ism (from the Latin word anima, «soul,); the other principle that's based on the existence of real non­human living beings (and those made up of subtle energies) is called spiritualism (from the Latin word spiritus, \"spirit\"). It's important to remember this difference since it ap­pears in literature over and over again. But in reality, these two models of explanation are not all as different as their sup­porters like to think. We can illustrate this by using the example of the wave-particle du­alism of light, which has puzzled physics for quite some time. Light sometimes behaves like a wave and sometimes like a particle regardless of the conditions of the experi­n1ent! It would therefore be wrong to unilaterally refer to light waves while simply ig­noring the physical reality of the light particles, and reverse. In the end, the physicists themselves decide which way the light should behave in their experiment or in their concept of the world. • 67 •"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"The same holds true for the magician. The concept that our reality is always the real­ity of the description should be confronted at an early stage; our reality merely reflects that which we are able to exp ress and perceive in one way or another. • You'll be running into this important principle of n1odern magic again and again throughout the course of this book. In practice, we need to choose the approach that's most likely work, and \\.vhatever that might be depends on a number of various factors, such as one's own spiritual com­position and ideological preferences, but also on practical aspects as well. As antira­tionalistic as it may seem, experience has shown that it's wise to not worry about the ap­parent contradiction between animistic and spiritualistic models of explanation; the easiest way to do this is by simply ((ignoring, the temptation to ponder their degree of truth. During a ritual, it's the experience or perception of energy that counts. InteHectual or even acaden1ic concepts such as animism or spiritualism have no business here. If you prefer the spiritualistic approach and want to believe that you're dealing with real spiri­tual beings, that's just fine. If, on the other hand, you prefer the psychological approach and view your ritual work as the external (((projecting,') confrontation with your own soul, you,U get good results as well. This book doesn't intend to sway you toward one way or another, because the prin­cipals that govern a magical ritual are exactly the same in both cases. However, this usu­ally only becomes clear through lots of experience. Thafs why this section already be­gins training the flexible application of the various philosophies and ideologies. THE BASIC STRUCTURE OF A ·MAGICAL RITUAL Now lefs talk about the basic structure of a magical ritual. If we take a look at the his­tory of Western ceremonial magic, we'll notjce that two main currents developed paral­lel to one another; they never joined, and they never stimulated one another in any mentionable way. We're talking about the cyclicaJ or circular ritual form, and the angu­lar or square ritual form. For now we're going to focus on the cir cular form since this is easier for the beginner to learn than the angular form and can be perf ormed effortlessly alone. 68 Introduction to Ritual Magic (II)"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"The angular structure, on the other hand, requires a great deal of basic knowledge about symbols and is more suited fo r working in groups of at least three people. Of course there are plenty of exceptions to the rule, but this statement can definitely be ap­plied to get the general picture. Moreover, the angular structure is predominately fo und in dogmatic and purely mystical systems. To avoid any misunderstandings, we need to point out that the term ((circular'' does­n't just mean that a magical circle is used, but also refers to the structure of the ritual it­self. This is the point we'd like to fo cus on here. The fo llowing description of the ritual structure can be fo und in nearly all of these types of rituals, even though the practition­ers and authors of these rituals are rarely aware of this. However, it would be quite help­ful fo r you to understand this basic structure in order to avoid symbol-logical errors or contradictions when developing your own rituals. A typical ritual of the circular tradition is structured as fo llows: 1. Preparation of the rituaJ 2. Opening banishing/purification 3. Main part 4. Closing banishing/purification and license to depart 5. Follow-up work after the ritual Chart 8: Basic structure of a ritual Below is a detailed description of the individual points of this chart. I. Preparation of the Ritual Preparation includes determining the goal, selecting the proper utensils, choosing the right time fo r the operation, establishing the structure of the ritual, dividing up the roles (for group rituals), and, of course, inwardly preparing fo r the ritual and concentrating on its purpose.

Often just planning the ritual has a similar effect on a subtle level as actually per­fo rming it. Once you actually begin, you realize that the work has already been done! Nonetheless, you should still perform the rituaJ even if it's just symbolic \"topping on the cake\" and to say a word of thanks.

Opening Banishing/Purification We,ve already discussed this in connection with the Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram. 3. Main Part The main part of the ritual is reserved fo r special magical operations. This includes, fo r example, calling upon energies to polarize, direct, and \"utilize, them, but also to simply experience them. Invocations, the charging of talismans and amulets, mystical experi­ences, evocations, the influence of others the list of possibilities is endless, and we don,t want to go into this in n1ore detail until later. Generally, meditation belongs to the main part of a ritual as well, and sometimes a more casual part is included too for example in fe stive group rituals such as to honor Pan, the moon goddess, or other energies where sacraments can be consumed, or where you can even laugh or talk. 4. Closing Banishing/Purification and License to Depart The closing banishing/purification and license to depart symbolically signify, among other things, the return to everyday consciousness. We've already discussed this part of the ritual in connection with the Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram as well. 5. FoUow-Up Work After the Ritual Careful fo llow-up work is just as important as the ritual itself. This not only includes writing in yo ur magical diary, but also monitoring the results of the operation and eval­uating the ritual itself (including constructive criticism!). Later on in this book we,ll be 70 Introduction to Ritual Magic (I I)"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"discussing the art of noticing and interpreting the effects of magic in more detail, espe­cially in everyday practi.cal magic. Circular rituals usually proceed more or less in a symmetrical way. If the ritual is opened with the Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram for banishing and purifica­tion, the ritual is closed with this as well; if the «veil of mysteries'' is opened with <t sym­bolic gesture, then it needs to be closed at the end of the ritual, too, and so on. Cyclical symmetry is one of the most important aspects of this ritual form and should always be upheld. If this symmetry is unintentionally neglected, it often impedes the success of the entire operation since this would be comparable to attempting to force a square peg into a round hole and situations like these are rarely taken well by the magical subconscious. At best, nothing will happen at all (or at least nothing perceptible), and at worst it could magically backfire with the activated energies turning against the magician. By the way, this simple but plausible law is most frequently violated in connec­tion with magic for healing, money, and love, as well as in magical warfare. But that's enough for now about ritual magic. However, we recommend that you think over the inf ormation in this section thoroughly since it will surely help clear up many things that a complete beginner might have trouble understanding at first . • APPLIED PARADIGM SHIFTING A paradigm is a set of basic ideological or technological assumptions or beliefs and therefore a model of explanation. Since magic is always a ''reality dance;' it would be log­ical to experiment with various paradigms. The magician should become famili ar with various philosophies of life not only in theory , but more importantly in practice as well. Only then can one control every aspect of his or her own reality production (and magic is nothing more than th at!) to fit one's individual needs, regardless of whether these concern everyday practical magic or are of a more mystical nature. After all, there's a little bit of truth in every philosophy of life in the sense of''probability,\" just like there's a good deal of falsehood in the sense of((im­probability.'' Nothing is absolute; at best, it just may seem that it is . • This relativistic principle is in no way as modern and iconoclastic as it may seem at first. Traditional churches) theologians, and cultural historians have often accused oc­cultism of being a ((pseudo-religion\" with syncretic influence, and theref ore dubious, Introduction to Ritual Magic (II) 71"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"fa bricated, and inconsequential. The dictionary defines \"syncretism,, as \"a fusion of dif­ferent religions, denominations or philosophical doctrines, generally without any fo rm of inner unity.,, Surely occultism and magic in general can rightfully be described as such a mixture if you disregard the fact that this much-abused \"bastard philosophy,, was born out of the attempt to recognize at least a minimum amount of inner unity in all re­ligious, mystical, and magical systems and institutions (which in turn fe d this philoso­phy with energy and convincingness), and that occultism is now widely tolerated due to its respect of all other paradigms (a fa ct which some of the more homogenous systems of thought and belief could learn a lesson from). In any case, regardless of all this, the great strength of occultism and magic lies in their variety and diversity. After all, every pantheon (or system of gods) is just a reproduction of a certain psy­chology either personal or collective that's disguised in mythical pictures. On the one hand, however, despite the many similarities there are surely just as many different psychologies as there were and are people. And on the other hand, each and every per­son has countless fa ces and personalities that often cannot be covered by just one pan­theon.2 For this reason, the everyday psychology of polytheism is generally much more refined and practice-oriented than monotheistic systems. This can be seen in the fact that the latter, fo llowing an initial period of blossoming, almost always develops into a sort of quasi-polytheism that often just thrives in the dark. This is how the trinity and sainthood developed in Christianity; in Buddhism, one Buddha was tu rned into thou­sands, especially in Tibetan tantra but also throughout the entire mahayana systet:n; in Islam similar to Christianity the Shiites flourished with their many saints and near­prophets; yes, even Judaism, which is particularly strict) developed polytheistic elements alongside the Kabbalah with its teachings of angels and demons as well as the sephi­roths, which are often embodied individually as well. We can illustrate this with an example that was, in turn, borrowed from Hermetic occultism. We,re familiar with the Roman god and astrological planet Mercury that rep­resents the principle of the intellect; however, it's also equated with the Greek god Her­.mes and ancient Egyptian god Thot (also called Ta huti, pronounced ((Djahuti, or ((Da­haut,). One quick look at Crowley's list of correspondences and analogies in Liber 777 shows that these three gods also share similarities on a practical level fo r example, the number 8, the color orange, and the metal mercury. But analogy is not the same as equality: Mercury is not Hermes or Thot, even if all three aspects are one and the same 72 Introduction to Ritual Magic (II)"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"basic principle. The magical novice may not recognize the often subtle differences be­tween these three embodiments right away, and all too often an experienced magician will mention them in the same breath as though they were interchangeable. But later during magical rituals and in everyday practical magic it will become obvious that this is definitely not the case: Mercury is fa r more playful than Thot, and even though he cannot deny his relationship to Hermes considering their shared cultural history, he's nevertheless quite different from him in many ways.j Ibis-headed Thot, on the other hand, is much stricter than both other deities and he was originally a moon god who was considered the master of time ·· a function that was assigned to Chronos or Saturn in the Hellenic and Roman pantheon. Such reflections are in no way meant to ruin the painstakingly acquired \"unit of the smallest common denominator', thafs characteristic fo r the equation of the three gods. This unit is present without a doubt and is often not revealed to the initiate until after deep meditation. Rather, our intention is to point out the differentiation that our ((mix­ture of gods>> enables. During a magical ritual, such a mixed pantheon gives us the choice between highly subtle different hues fo r example, the experienced magician would prefer to use the energy of Thot fo r an operation concerning the strict interpre­tation of a law. For a case involving fraud in which one may even be working on the side of the defendant, Mercury wouJd be more appropriate. Forensic medical reports, on the other hand, would fa ll under the scope of Hermes, and so on. All of these examples are just approximations that are subject to change depending on subjective assess.ment and experience. But they at least reflect the value of this magi­cal skill of being able to comfortably work with several systems at the same time, or, to put it in more modern, coUoquiaJ terms, changing paradigms like the shirt on your back. This results in the fo ll owing mnemonic phrase that should definitely not just re­main theoretical, but should also be applied in daily practice as weU: Th e magician chooses one's beliefs like the surgeon chooses his or her instruments. Lefs give this piece of information the finishing touch by adding another guiding principle that stems from modern-day Chaos Magic, making it particularly effective through its fa irly clear-cut wording: Belief is just a technique. Introduction to Ritual Magic (II) 73"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"Even if you don)t fully agree with this sentence, we recommend meditating on it over a longer period of time and at least adopting it as a valid working hypothesis (even if just fo r reasons of later discussion). Because when we start discussing the magic of Austin Osman Spare, this sentence will play a central role in our practice as well. The contemporary practice of brainwashing has shown that it's relatively simple to turn an atheist into a Christian, a Hindu into a Maoist, a Christian into a Buddhist, or a fascist into a communist at least temporarily. The prerequisite fo r this is merely the specific and skillful application or removal of certain stimuli. Certainly political brain­washing is a fo rm of torture; but instead of playing helpless and complaining about a world that allows such atrocities to happen, we should fo cus on the positive aspects that can help us as magicians if we adapt such techniques to optimize our magic. On the one hand, the systematic and intentional shifting of paradigms can destroy the illusion that we're dependent on our beliefs and can only d.efine ourselves according to such. A per­son who doesn't st rive fo r the absolute in the external world will never again be subject to the illusions that the external world may present as absolute reality. (''Nothing is true, everything is permitted, was supposedly said by the old man in the mountains.)This person,s also immune to the temptations of religious, political, and social indoctrination and has mastered (in the sense of Mao Ts e-Tung) the philosophical gueri11a attack. On the other hand, rigid systems are always subject to limitation. Through frequent, conscious system shifting the magician creates a much larger area fo r maneuvering; he or she not only becomes more versatile, but even has more potential because he or she • has become aware of the illusionary character of limits and no lo nger needs to accept them helplessly as before. However, it can also be useful as well to stick with one system of beliefs or thoughts fo r a longer period of time as long as yo ur flexibility doesn't suffer from doing so. This can help avoid that certain superficiality thafs an inherent danger of the other practice. Now rigid belief systems are not completely useless, otherwise they surely wouldn,t have had such a strong grip on our everyday reality fo r thousands of years. They give people something to hold on to, even if fo r just a fragile moment and even if they have to pay a very high price fo r this wobbly security (such as the loss of freedom and intel­lectual independence); after all, they'd much rather have it this way than fe el utterly helpless at life's mercy. ln pa rticular, people who are unstable and insecure have trouble coping with the delicate balancing act between the various realities. 74 Introduction to Ritual Magic (II)"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"• Magic has always been sin1ilar to walking on a tightrope without a net, and ifs surely not wrong to say that a magician usually has one fo ot in the grave and the other in the nuthouse. The trick is keeping your balance without landing in one or the other, thereby enjoying the complete freedom of someone who walks the line. But in order to do so, thorough grounding is an absolute must. THE IMPORTANCE OF GROUNDING The true shamans of primitive tribes seldom concentrate on just being shamans. In ad­dition to their jobs as a medicine man or woman, healer or sorcerer, they carry out their usual tribal responsibilities as well, such as hunting, gathering, fishing, or fa rming. In fa ct, the best method of grounding is having a normal, everyday job. The reasons fo r this might not be clear to everyone right off, which is why we'd like to go into it a bit fu rther. If we think about the above statements a bit more, we'll discover that magicians often have to function in quite extreme states of consciousness that diffe r considerably from everyday reality. Although they'll be integrating their magic (and therefore their applied gnosis as well) into their everyday life more and more with practice, this doesn't mean that the borderlines between the two become blurred they merely become more permeable. These are two entirely different things, and shamanistic cultures in particu­lar show us again and again how serious the problem of spiritual stability is dealt with by these \"magical experts.\" For example, every member of such a tribe accepts the fa ct that there are spirits and that one can perceive them and communicate with them, but this is definitely not true in our rationaJistic civilization. Such a person who sees spirits and talks to them regularly will probably end up in a padded cell, which is how our cul­ture deals with such deviations from the norm. But if a member of a native tribe constantly sees spirits that haunt one wildly, and if one even neglects his or her everyday obligations to the community fo r this reason, this person would certainly be declared insane and he or she,d be expelled from society. We'll find a similar situation among the ancient kabbalists. In the old days, whoever wanted to study the Kabbalah with an initiated rabbi not only had to be of a certain age, but also had to prove that they had both fe et on the ground in their job as well as in their everyday life. During my own seminars fve noticed again and again that people who seem to be anchored in their jobs more than average actually make the quickest progress in magic. Introduction to Ritual Magic (II) 75"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"Managers, fo r example, who already work seventy or eighty hours a week still seem to find three or fo ur hours fo r their magic, and such people are usually able to apply it to everyday situations with lots of creativity and intelligence. On the other hand, people who have lots of free time on their hands seem to have more trouble progressing with their magic. Being subject to job-related or financial stress is surely favorable fo r maxi­mum performance in all areas, but this phenomena has much deeper roots. We need to remember that the extreme situations mentioned above that magic con­fr onts us with are particularly tempting to the more psychologically unstable who are lacking material roots. But usually such people are not really looking fo r magic itself, but rather some sort of playground where they can let out their psychological problems without being disturbed; or they're searching fo r a substitute fo r the usual types of ther­apy. In extremely rare cases, magic can offer them both of these and even heal them (in the sense of\"heal)) = «to make whole''). But usuaJly these types of people tend to fe el at­tracted to the negative, destructive energies in magic since these appear to be of greater intensity in their eyes . • In a certain way, this is a vicious circle. For successfully practicing the magic arts, a • certain degree of psychological tension is absolutely necessary, as we'll see later when discussing astromagic. (This is one reason why most magicians are generally quite bor­ing people.) If you look at it this way, magic does indeed fu lfill a therapeutic role fo r many practitioners because it allows them to specifically direct their psychological ten­sions and imbalances into something constructive, thereby ga ining control of them as well. On the other hand, extreme magical experiences can sometimes unconsciously trigger psychological disturbances. But it's important to remember that it's not the magic that can drive a person insane. On the contrary, it does nothing more than tear open the veil covering our psychological sham existence in which an occasiona.l swamp blossom can thrive among the shadows that silently poison the organism as a whole (which the psyche is naturally a part of). Confronting one,s own fe ars which every good magician does thoroughly is a good example of this process. Being embedded in a ((normal\" everyday job helps to stay grounded and gives magi­cians something to hold on to at times when they fe el that the ground is being pulled out from under their fe et; it protects them from the possession of complexes/demons by constantly confronting them with a different reality that is, fo r the n1ost part, unmagical 76 Introduction to Ritual Magic (II)"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"in which they also fa ce challenges that need to be n1astered. Of course, having a job that demands high performance is no cure-all for magical problems, but experience has shown that it usually can help to avoid such problems or get them under control. But magic demands much more, of course, and this can be accomplished by regu­larly practicing the Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram and the KabbaJistic Cross. Other exercises fo r grounding and stabilization will come later, but the important thing fo r now is probably just a healthy degree of self-confidence, as long as it's not muddled by arrogance or the overestimation of your abilities. After all, only a person who knows and realizes one's limits is able to overcome them. 1. This is the deeper meaning of the shamanic saying \"What you perceive is what is true.,. 2. There's a similar phrase in the Egyptian Book of the Dead: \"In every part of your body lives a god., 3. Hermes, fo r example> wears distinct symbols of a god of death or souls, just like Thot does psychpom­pos while Mercury (at least in a later astrological sense) predominately represents the aspects of a god of trade and communication.

THE MEANING OF THE FORMULAS/GOD-NAMES IN THE GREAT ER RITUAL OF THE PENTAGRAM The Hebrew Formulas3 JHVH (Jehovah or Ya hweh) is generally translated as \"I AM WHO I AM,, the self-definition of the creator god from the book of Genesis.

It portrays the sun wheel and represents both the all-penetrable and omnipresent as well as the centeredness and the center around which everything revolves. Instead of the usual triangular alchemistic symbols used to represent the elements, the Greater Ritual of the Pentagram uses the cherubic or astrological symbols. This may confuse some beginners at first, which is why we'd like to briefly explain this. The Biblical cherubs (or kerubs, Hebrew Cherubim) are the angels and guardians of heaven that are understood by Western ceremonial magicians as guardians of the ele­ments.

This is the reason why the cherubs were considered to be the Israeli equivalents to the Egyptian sphinxes. Two of these symbols can be fo und in the Greater Ritual of the Pentagram in the pentagrams of Fire and Water, whereby in the case of Fire, the astro­logical symbol fo r Leo is used as well. This holds true as well for the symbol of Ta urus in the pentagram of Earth. A beginner with little knowledge of astrology may find it difficult to understand the symbol used in the pentagram of Air, which resembles water. One might expect the eagle's head here instead. In the writings of the Golden Dawn, this is substantiated by the fact that the air contains water in the fo rm of rain and humidity. This may not seem very logical and convincing to some, but lefs not fo rget that the astrological zodiac sign Aquarius is an Air sign, and this is also the symbol that we're dealing with here. The eagle, on the other hand, which might remind the beginner of Air, is also the al­chemistic symbol for distillation, which indicates a watery process. In addition, many early astrologers used to use it in place of the watery sign of Scorpio. This makes the eagle,s relationship to the element of Wa ter thoroughly understandable. The element of Earth, on the other hand, is assigned the astrological symbol of Ta urus, which indeed actually belongs to this element and is meant to represent diligence. Please note that in contrast to the customary astrological symbol fo r Ta urus, the circle in the one used here contains a dot, similar to the astrological symbol fo r the sun. This also indicates Elemental Magic 89"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"the \"horned sun,', which is linked to the Persian-Roman Mithras cult with its death and fe rtility themes. For a more profound understanding of the Greater Ritual of the Pentagram, ifs im­portant to keep in mind that the elements do not remain static inside the circle or the pentagram itself they stand in direct interaction with one another, and the choreogra­phy of the movements of their energies is one of the cosmic prerequisites fo r both ani­mistic and spiritualistic magic. Pa nta rei, <'everything flows,\" is how Heraclitus described it, and our attempts at using structure to capture this flow must not lead us to the mis­leading assumption that we're dealing with undynamic constants. Within the ritual cir­cle and inside the pentagram, we must consciously realize that the elements do not act as opposites with a direct line of connection. In this circle, Air does not stand opposite of Earth, and Fire opposite of Wa ter as some naive authors with no knowledge of sym­bol-logic claim but rather Air and Water, Fire and Earth. In the pentagram as well, the contrasting pairs do not stand opposite one another, but rather one above the other they>re only connected indirectly. Because AIR EARTH or FIRE WATER acting as opposites would balance each other out, causing a standstill or in more modern terms, entropy. After all, no element is stronger, or fo r that matter \"better,', than the others. Only Ether stands above the po­larity of the subordinate elements and is often considered to be the origin thereof. • Yo u might want to meditate on this symbolism fo r a while and absorb it until it be­comes intuition.

Our rationalistic civilization places a great deaJ of value on this since unpredictability, such as that of natural disasters, is con­&idered to be something dangerous and life-threatening. The intuitive and synthetically active right half of the brain, on the other hand, prefers imagery thafs unpredictable and imprecise. The fa ct that this makes it suscepti­ble fo r subtle cosmic and spiritual correlations is seldom understood today. But precision has its limits, just as imprecision does. In both cases, too much is not desired, although this is seldom practiced willingly. Let's have a look at this using an oracle as an example. In divination, the fo llowing ruJes are quickly learned: The less precise the message of an oracle is, the more likely it is to be accurate. The more precise the message of an oracle is, the less likely it is to be accurate. Elemental Magic 93 •"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"If someone asks you to read his oracle and you predict ((Next week many things in your life will change,\" the skeptic may just shake his head at such a ((wishy-washy'' state­ment. However, your rate of accuracy is most likely to be extraordinarily high after aU, you didn,t say exactly what was going to happen, how it would happen, and when! You achieved a potentially higher rate of accuracy by limiting the precision of your prediction. But if you were to predict <'In exactly one week from today at 3:03 pm, you'll meet a blond man at the train station on track 6 who'll give you a check fo r $2044.84,\" your chances of being accurate would be next to nothing as compared to your first predic­tion. You achieved a more precise prediction by limiting the rate of accuracy. Of course, both examples are extreme cases and shouldn't deny the possibility of achieving a high rate of accuracy with precise predictions but daily divination usually operates in the gray area between these two extremes. . We only want to illustrate the fact that images and symbols generally escape the sci­entific definition of precision fo r the most part and should therefore be treated accord­ingly. Once we,ve comprehended this mechanism, we,U find it easier to work construc­tively with symbols such as the elements, tarot cards, or astrological aspects, just to mention a few examples. According to definition, symbols are always ambiguous and can never be interpreted in just one fixed way. Besides, they're way too subjunctive as well. For example, just ask your friends what they associate with a circle or square as a symbol. Surely their answers will overlap in many areas, which only means that although symbols are ambivalent, they are in no way arbitrary. But the answers will differ in many areas as well which, on the other hand, means that symbols can do more than just transport one single • mean mg. A tarot deck consists of pictures and when we ask it a question we need to fo rmulate it in such a way that the pictures can answer it. Questions about telephone numbers or lottery numbers will usuaUy be futile fo r this method of divination, although sometimes it's difficult to realize this when we're frustrated by the caprioles of our subconscious mind and its magic. (Remember the example about the horse-riding competition and aftershave in the last section?) The thing we like to call ((the symbol-logical fuzzy relation\" that we,ve illustrated here with a few humorous examples plays quite a concrete role in your magical practice. 94 Elemental Magic"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"For example, it's much easier to perform magic fo r ((wealth, in general instead of trying to aim fo r a specific sum of money. In the same way, it's much easier to use n1agic to help us live out our own True Will instead of using it to influence the external world by making sexuaJ partners, enemies, wealthy aunts, etc. submit to our will. This has often been used as an argument to support the idea of a basically moral and ethical function­ing cosmos, but trus reasoning is in no way compulsory. Once again we,re talking about karma as a moral-free law of cause and eff ect. People who fo rmulate their goals too pre­cisely fo rge their own chains that will often prevent them from reaching this goal in the end. Later on we'U delve into this subject a bit deeper when talJ<jng about the «neither­neither, principle in the magic of Austin Osman Spare. Here's another example. You want to contact a certain person but don,t have the address. It would be much more promising to charge a sigil fo r \"making contact\" with the person in general instead of specifying the means of contact by telephone or letter, fo r example. Our main intention here is just to point out that there's no purpose in wanting to destroy symbols and pictures (which is exactly what we work with in magic) through ra ­tionalization. With this concept, we)re not claiming that precise magicaJ operations are not possible at all. If a magician wants a certain apartment or a certain job, or to win a specific lawsuit, magic can certainly be used to achieve this, but it's just much more dif­ficult than aiming fo r more general goals. The challenge posed to a skilled magician in the rationalistic paradigm surely lies in the technical precision of one's n1agic; but the be­ginner should avoid becoming fixated on achieving precision accuracy. Even the most ex­perienced magicians usually only hit stray shots, which is not a deficit as long as the gen­eral direction of these is correct. The secret of a successful master magician is the ability to define the goaJ as precisely as possible while leaving the path to its realization wide open, and only specifying the minimum in detail required to prevent unwanted results. Plus, the symbol-logical fuzzy relation in magic has powerful advantages that no exact science can match. On the one hand, it comprises the magical power of the sub­conscious and the right side of the brain much easier when skillfully used since these react better to something that is blurred or unclear (which is not the same as \"inaccu­rate,,!). Pictures and symbols react. On the other hand, it gives us the ability to recognize relationships and opportunities where a rationalist may only see separation and limita­tion.

PRACTICAL EXERCISES ExERCISE 8 KABBALISTIC CROSS (11) Practice the Kabbalistic Cross three times a day fo r eight weeks. Preferably you should do this right after getting up in the morning, or right after tak­ing a bath or shower while your body's still wet. During the exercise, make sure your fa ce is directed toward a light source (natural or artificial); this will help you feel the light's energy stronger and absorb it easier. However, you don,t need to actually concentrate on the light. Proceed as you>re used to from Exercise 2, but with one difference: Don,t touch your body with your hand when drawing the lines! Keep your hand five to ten inches away from the corresponding point of your body. This will train your subtle perception and get you accustomed to working with your body's energies; 96 Elemental Magic"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"it will also aid your ability to see and feel auras and represents a prelimi­nary stage in mental/astral training.

ExERCISE 9 PRACTICE OF THE GREATER RITU.AL OF THE PENTAGRAM Perforn1 the Greater Ritual of the Pentagram once every two weeks at a time of your choice fo r at least fo ur months. Do this like you,d perform any normal ritual: I. Banish with the Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram 2. Perform the Greater Ritual of the Pentagram 3. Meditate on the elements 4. Banish with the Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram and li­cense to depart Pay particular attention to how you perceive the elements. After doing this fo ur times, you can combine this exercise with Exercise 5 in order to fine­tune your energy perception even more. To do so, you'll need to adapt Ex· ercise 5 to fit the Greater Ritual of the Pentagram. EXERCISE 10 APPLIED PARADIGM SHIFTING IN PRACTICE (1) a) Go to a Catholic church one Sunday and observe the magical as­pects of the Mass. How is the ritual structured? b) Do the same with a Protestant church service and note the differ­ences from the Catholic rite. c) Do the same with church services and rituals of at least two other denominations of your choice (either Christian or non-Christian, • Elemental Magic 97"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"such as Greek Orthodox, Adventistic, Mormon, Jewish, Islam, Bud­dhist, Hindu, etc.). The more you familiarize yourself with various religious rites by personally experiencing them, the better. d) Later, try outlining the basic structure of each ritual including the sequence of events, the utensils used, the role distribution of those involved, the actual procedure, and so on. The reason why we recommend Christian rituals at first is that they usu­ally require no special effort to view them since there are churches nearly everywhere that hold services. Even if you,re not a religious person you can still learn from such per­sonal experience. Last but not least, you'll also learn firsthand how much magic in these ancient religious cults has survived up to the present day ·· but also how littJe knowledge and understanding of this magic remains. Try to be as inconspicuous as possible at these religious services and just experience the energies passively instead of trying to play an active role. Maybe you'll even be surprised to see that many rituals can develop quite a unique magical energy, even if the congregation and priests, or rit­ual leaders, may not be aware of this. You should complete this exercise within a two-month period but fe el free to repeat it later as often as desired. EXERCISE ll TRAINING OF MAGICAL PERCEPTION (111) The 180° Gaze . Yo u've already become fa miliar with the idea behind this technique in Exercise Se. This is definitely one of the best methods fo r training your magical perception (e.g., of auras).

You can repeat this exercise as often as you like but you should do it at least fifty times within a period of six months. Yo u can vary the exercise as well to make it less time consuming, fo r example by doing it at work fo r a fe w minutes, or while waiting fo r a traffic light, and in other similar situations.

This holds true no n1atter what you learn, not just in magic, and it would be a good idea if you keep in mind that learning always requires you to sacrifice time and energy. Of course, you could and should set your own pace.

In simpler terms, the pentagram represents the ((earthly'' aspect of creation while the hexagram portrays the \"cosmic', aspect. But this seems to be the only aspect of the hexagram ritual that all magicians can agree on: There are so many versions of this ritual, some grossly mutilated or completely twisted in meaning, and some authors (such as Miers in his Lexikon des Geheimwissens) even doubt that the hexagram ritual was genuinely passed down throug.hout magical tradition at aU. Crowley distinguishes between the ('Greater'' and «Lesser Ritual of the Hexagram,\" while the Golden Dawn only referred to the ((Hexagram Ritual'' in general, or to the <'Lesser Ritual of the Hexagram,\" that is if we're to believe Regardie. These are basically identical to Crowley's versions despite their different names, but you shouJd al­ways pay particular attention to such <tminor details, in magic, especially when reading authors who come from a dogmatic and strictly literal tradition. For practical reasons and because the Golden Dawn tradition is not specifically focused on one certain magi­cian like Crowley,s is, we,d like to use the Golden Dawn system as a reference here, even if some of our details may differ. 103"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"• Modern magic has taken excerpts from what the Golden Dawn calls the \"Hexagram Ritual, (or Crowley,s '(Greater Ritual of the Hexagram,,) for use in practical planetary magic. This seems completely logical and justifiable, which we're about to see. But be­fore we start thinking about that, we first need to take a look at the basic structure of the hexagram ritual according to the tradition of the Golden Dawn. In order to do so, we need to take a look at the symbolism of the hexagram itself. In Illustration 17, you'll see the basic symbols that make up the hexagram. The upwards pointing triangle stands fo r the male principle (not just fo r the element of Fire), and the downwards pointing triangle stands for the fe male principle (not just for the element of Wa ter). The hexagram is ancient in this fo rm and interpretation and can be found in Eastern cultures as well, such in Hindu tantra in the meditation symbol '<Sri Ya ntra'' where it's understood as the union of Shiva (maJe principle) and Shakti (female princi­ple). Its symbolic message also corresponds to the Chinese yin-yang symbol (the so­called tai chi). male principle female principle fllustration 17: The structure of the hexagram 104 Planetary Magic (I)"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"In the Western tradition, the hexagram is also called the ((Sear) or <<Key of Solomon;' and is even more popular under the name \"Star of David.\"• The relationship to the biblical King Solomon will be discussed in more detail later when we mention the influences of Judaism and the Christian tradition on Western magic. For now it's sufficient to mention that Solomon has been the archetype or epit­ome of the wise (and sometimes even blasphemous) magician since the early days of time. So we can see that the hexagram represents the basic polarity of all existence. But its symbolism goes much deeper since it also stands for the (macrocosmic) spheres of the planets in the same way the pentagram symbolizes the (microcosmic) spheres of the ele­ments. This is also why the hexagram was used to portray the mystical or theurgical path, while the pentagram was used to portray the magical or demonic path. But this in no way prevents the magician from working with the planetary powers in everyday magic and turning to the aid of the hexagram to do so. Such a distinction between \"mysticat>, and \"magical, is purely theoretical anyway, as we'll see later on. The magician generally finds it easier to comprehend the model that works with the elements since these have a direct influence on his environment. In a way, one>s \"grounded\" or anchored in concrete tangibility. Working with the planetary powers, however, involves contact with more subtle powers that are often regarded as supreme (keyword: \"our fate is in the stars,,), which could be interpreted as aspects of inner spir­itual structures just as well. Since the hexagram plays such an exceptional role in planetary magic (which in turn is extremely important to our work as magicians), we need to deal with each of the planetary principles in detail. Of course, our book isn't able to go into as much detail as literature on ast rology can, which is why ifs vital that we recommend further reading later on. However, only a handful of astrology books actually deal with the magical as­pects of the planets. We'll be discussing the individual planetary principles in more de­tail later on as we progress with our training in planetary magic, so a rough summary will suffice for now. Those of you who are already well familiar with the planetary pow­ers can just skim over the next section. Planetary Magic (I) 105"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"THE PLANETARY POWERS IN MAGIC Magic usually recognizes seven ((classical\" planets, which need to be understood in an as­trologi.cal sense. This means that the sun and moon (which, astrologicaUy speaking, are not considered to be planets at all) are certainly viewed as such in magic. This represents the geocentric world view that all celestial bodies revolve around the earth as its axis an outlook thafs still valid in magic today in symbolic form. To put this in magical terms, it means that the magician stands at the axis of one,s own universe and everything ro­tates around him or her. At the same time, this concept also contains one of the greatest dangers of magic, namely megalomania, which can lead to a serious overestimation of one's own abilities and delusional self-in1portance. The only way to avoid this is by sys­tematically monitoring your results especially in everyday practical magic and ap­plying the appropriate objectivity and sobriety. We,ve already mentioned one of the basic principles of Western magic, and it wasn,t just Aleister Crowley who supported this viewpoint in the twentieth century: DEUS EST HOMO HOMO EST DEUS uGod is Man Man is God'': indeed a daring claim that's nonetheless proven every day in magical practice, but only if we understand it correctly. If we view magic as a means of self-finding and self-realization, it will become clear that we first need to put ourselves in the center of everything. But the interesting question here is \"What do we actually mean by (ourselves,?,, There's one common misunderstanding that especially the beginner needs to avoid. The astrological or magical planets have very little in common with the celestial bodies we know from astronomy. Of course, horoscopy makes use of the tables of celestial bod­ies called ephemerides (which are, by the way, astronomica1ly and not astrologically cal­culated) and the movement of the actual planets in the sky serves as a point of refe.rence, but the interpretation of this movement is purely mantic, or omen-based. Despite astrol­ogy's claims to being scientific (as defined in the rationalistic-materialistic sense of the nineteenth century), this system is and remains intuitive art and not an exact science. Symbol-logically it makes no difference at all to the magician what the planets Mer­cury or Mars really look like, or what gravity they have there and what the atmosphere is made up of. The symbolic planets have just as little (and as much) in common with 106 Planetary Magic (I)"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"the physical ones, just like a poem called (( 0 Sweet Rosemary)) would have with the botanical plant of the san1e name. The only way to find a correspondence in both com­ponents is by applying C. G. Jung's psychoanalysis and its principle of synchronicity (in which the relationship of equality is transcribed causally with non related events) as well as its analogies, which we,ll run into later in connection with the magical principles of symbolic correspondences. In other words, in magic we'd never assume that Mercury's power of attraction or the cosmic rays from Mars are influencing our earthly well-being, but rather we view the moving stars as living external symbols, which may indicate the occurrence of certain events and situations, but certainly not cause them. Like every pantheon (as the planets have been since ancient Chaldea), the planetary powers offer us above all extremely sophisticated psychology and existential teachings with the help of which we as magicians can define our goals clearly and tackle their realization. The three \"nonclassical,, planets (Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto) are designated as such because they were discovered quite late: Uranus (which is called '(Herschel\" in older literature after the person who discovered it) was first sighted in 17 81 with the help of the telescope; Neptune's discovery followed in the year J 846 by Galle (after previous cal­culations made by Leverrier and Adams); Pluto wasn't sighted until 1930 by Tombaugh. Even today, there's still no standard astrological interpretation of these three planets, al­though the various astrological schools at least reflect some similarities in their rendi­tions. After all, the symbolic powers of these planets also called \"trans-Saturnian plan­ets, since they lie beyond the classical planetary sphere bordered by Saturn · are considered extremely difficuJt to handle magically, which is why we,ll only be dealing with the classical planets here. You should memorize these seven planets along with their symbols and most signif­icant correspondences as soon as possible. For better illustration, we've listed them in Chart 12 along with their astrological/magical symbols, their corresponding kabbaJistic numbers, and their Hebrew formulas in the hexagram ritual. Other correspondences (such as metal, color, sephira, and so on) will follow later in connection with magical correspondences and planetary rituals. Theref ore, just like the elements, the planets are symbol-logical principles of order and structure. In this sense, they fulfill a function similar to the sephiroths of the kabbal­istic Tree of Life, the three aggregate states of alchemy (sulfur, mercu ry, salt), the three In­dian gunas (sattva, rajas, and tamas), as well as other comparable symbol structures.

Unlike the penta­gram, the hexagram in its classical fo rm cannot be drawn in one single line without lift­ing the hand, therefore two separate but interlocking triangles are drawn. In doing so, the fo llowing rules apply, so please memorize these as well: Invoking is always clockwise. Banishing is always counterclockwise. The first hexagram always begins on the point corresponding to the planet. The second hexagram always begins on the point opposite the planet. Charts 13a and l3b will show you how to draw each planetary hexagram. We need to describe the hexagram ritual in such a complicated way at first because its various fo rms and versions will not become clear until you've studied its basic principles. On that note, here's one more comment on the principle of invoking and banishing. According to basic symbol-logic structure, a magical operation should always be de­sjgned as symmetrically as possible. If, fo r example, the \"veil to the magical world is opened,, at the beginning of a ritual, it needs to be symbolically closed at the end of the operation as well. If a certain power is invoked, it needs to be dismissed as weU. The term '(banishing,, is a bit confusing in terms of planetary powers or deities since the be­ginner often understands this to mean \"scare, or \"drive away.\" Actually, only demons or elemental powers are truly banished; deities, on the other hand, are never driven away due to their superiority, but are dismissed instead.• 110 Planetary Magic ( 1)"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"Invoking 0 YOD-HE-VAU-HEH ELOA VA-DAATH ARARlTA SHADDAI EL SHAI ARARITA ELOHIM TZABAOTH ARARITA YOD-HE-VAU-HEH TZABAOTH ARARITA Banishing 0 YOD-HE-VAU-HEH ELOA VA-DAATH ARARlTA SHADDAI EL SHAI ARARITA J) ELOHIM TZABAOTH ARARITA YOD-HE-V AU-HEH TZABAOTH ARARITA Chart 13a: The directions fo r drawing the hexagrams and their fo rrnulas ( 1) Planetary Magic (I) 111"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"Only in extreme cases, such as if the magician is in danger of becoming uncontrollably possessed, would one use the banishing against the planetary powers.

AN OUTLINE OF THE PLANETARY PRINCIPLES Here's a short summary of the planetary principles. In parentheses we,ve listed the Latin descriptions that are sometimes used in literature. Sun (Sol) Basic principles: vitality, reasoning, consciousness, center of being, centeredness, po­tency, giving, creating, linear knowledge, intellectual analysis, structuring. Practical magical application: Improving the quality of life, magic fo r health and prosperity, gaining wisdom and centeredness, stabilizing one's magical identity, pro­moting general and specific plans in a business, health, or power/political sense. Moon (Luna) Basic principles: fe mininity, intuition, emotion, sensitivity, dream, fe rtility, receptive­ness, producing and dissolving, change, .inconsistency, rhythm, cyclic knowledge, emo­tional synthesis, sense of structure. Practical magical application: divination, clairvoyance, anima work, dream work, sex magic, magic dealing with emotions, improvement of subtle perception, magic dealing with decomposition and uncertainty, improving the perception of cycles and rhythms. Mercury (Mercurius) Basic principles: the intellect, language and speech, communication, healing, cunning and shrewdness, thievery, business sense, recognition of structure. Practical magical application: magic fo r healing, money magic, help with examina­tions, interviews, business negotiations, etc., and the support of intellectual activities.

Practical magical application: creating harmony, finding lovers, magic fo r influenc­ing emotions, money magic, supporting artistic and promotional projects. Mars (Mars) Basic principles: driving fo rce (dynamics), self-authority, sexuality, passion, fighting, competition, aggression, courage, self-protection, the fight fo r structure. Practical magical application: rituals fo r attack and pro.tection, work dealing with authority, finding sexual partners, improving the quality of life, work with the gnosis of anger. Jupiter ( Iovis) Basic principles: overview, luxury, wealth, abundance, religion, generosity, grandeur, ethics, expansion, growth, widening structures. Practical magical application: magic fo r wealth and prosperity, magic fo r luck and happiness, the support of healing operations, gaining philosophical-ethical insight, rit-uals of self-assertion. I • Saturn (Saturnus) Basic principles: restriction, concentration, severity, initiation, concretization, ground­ing, perseverance, wisdom, trueness to detail, sickness, death, time (also known as Chronos in this function), compulsory structure. Practical magical application: finding a job, real-estate matters, improving concen­tration, the concretization of material projects, magic dealing with death. Of course, the great number of practical magical applications possible is in no way ex­hausted with this short list. Also, don't let it bother you that some aspects seem to over­lap. For example, money magic can be performed using the sun, but also using Jupiter, Venus, or Mercury, although there are slight differences, which we'll get to later when we discuss the individual planetary rituals. For now, just familiarize yourself with the prin­ciples we've mentioned. 114 Planetary Magic (I)"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"THE PRONUNCIATION OF HEBREW WORDS IN THE WESTERN MAGICAL TRADITION The Hebrew Kabbalah is considered one of the basic pillars of Western n1agic. This mainly has historical reasons of a spiritual and religious nature: Christianity, as it devel­oped from Mosaic or Jewish beliefs, gave rise to a strict orientation to the Bible that can even be fa natical at times. The modern relationship between shamans or native tribes to average New Agers re­sembles that of medieval occultists to their Jews: a somewhat exotic people whose reli­gious customs seemed so strange to noninitiates that it was often suspected that Judaism contained the knowledge that was sought in vain in one's own religion. Thus, one adopted the Jewish doctrine that Hebrew is not a normal language like all others, but rather the primeval language of creation itself. In this sense, these languages contained magical power, and exact knowledge of their esoteric legitimacy was considered a pre­requisite fo r all serious magic. The same still holds true with Hinduism and the Sanskrit language, which has had such a major impact on mantramism that it led to the belief that some mantras are as \"dangerous'' to noninitiates as weapons are to children. By the way, that held true until well into the twentieth century and especially the classic authors of magic literature such as Levi, Pap us, Gua\"ita, and even Mathers, Crowley, and Waite al­ways attached great importance to kabbalistic and Hebrew (which are not necessarily identical) formulas. Yo u've already encountered a number of Hebrew fo rmulas (god-names, names of archangels) in the Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram, the Greater Ritual of the Pentagram, and now in this section in the hexagram ritual. In the case of the pentagram rituals, we made suggestions as to how to pronounce these words using phonetic spelling fo r easier use. We'U do so in the future as weU, fo r example in the next section where we'll explain the hexagram ritual in more detail. Even though we tell you what these formulas actually mean, we still need to point out that the acoustic or mantric ef­fect they have is much n1ore important. Later during your mantra training, you,ll also be working with formulas from Sanskrit, Pali, Arabic, Japanese, and ancient Greek to fa ­miliarize you with the differences in the quality of energy of each language. Planetary Magic (I) 115"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"The pronunciation of ancient Hebrew has not been perfectly preserved. Like every other language, it underwent phonetic development that cannot easily be reconstructed. By the way, this holds true fo r all Semitic languages since their alphabets have no or just some vowels. For example, when a Hebrew or Arab writes the word ((KTB,\" this could be read as \"KATABA, or as \"KITABU:, but even \"KATABU, could be possible as well. Of course, each of these words means something entirely diffe rent (e.g., in Arabic kataba, \"to write\"; kitabu, ((book\"; katabu, ('they write\"), which makes these languages quite difficult fo r an American to learn. However, some older texts contain ((diacritical marks,, fo r vocalization that make such literature much easier to read. (In Hebrew, these are various dots and lines such as the segol, the tzere, and the shew na', while in Arabic these special marks include the fa tah, the kasra, and more.) But there are even various renditions of entire sentences as a result of the various possible ways to interpret t.he consonant structure. In the Semitic linguistic area, special genres of literature (especially in poetry) have even developed to play with this structure, creating aphorisms and po­etry that can be read and understood in a countJess nun1ber of ways. In the nineteenth century, the study of Hebrew along with Greek and Latin was considered part of a humanistic general education, which certainly influenced magic and its authors as well. Of course, this doesn't change the fa ct that the pronunciation of Hebrew ritual fo rmulas was never reaUy standardly defined. The magician should be aware of this when encountering kabbalistically influenced texts that may claim that there's only ('one true\" pronunciation of special Hebrew words, and may not even reveal what it is. Indeed) there's only \"one true'' way to pronounce every n1agical fo rn1ula, namely, the n1ost effective way! But this is always subjective and only the magician can decide what's effective fo r oneself. Our recommendations fo r pro­nunciation have been taken from practice and do not necessarily have anything to do with \"proper Hebrew., If we use modern spoken Hebrew as a basis (so-called Ivrit) and take the example of the Kabbalistic Cross, we,d have to say ((wa, instead of ''ve,, whereby the ''w, is spoken softly like the English word <'wine,, and the \"a\" would be short. The word «Malkuth, on the other hand, would be pronounced similar to ''Mall-chuf, with a short «a,', a long \"1,,> and a guttural ((ch, similar to the German \"ch,, in the word ('doch.\" The pronunciation of the formula ((Ateh, in original Hebrew is extremely difficult to ex­plain without going into a scientific exposition; an attempt wouJd be \"N -tteh,\" dropping 116 Plarzetary Magic (I}"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"the voice after the <'a'' such as in the English word '(baboon,, a powerful ('t,\" and a sharp, short \"eh', in the second syllable, which is emphasized. The last example makes it clear that the acoustic effect would be entirely different if we used the relatively harsh, short, and guttural sounds of the modern Hebrew language. A long, sonorous mantra, on the other hand, has the advantage that it can actually make the walls of your ((inner temple, quake, which is why we prefer it here. Most modern magicians, however, usually don't even realize that ((their\" Hebrew isn't necessarily that of Orthodox Jews or To rah schol­ars, and are unknowing of the actual reasons for this. But it would nevertheless be help­ful if you'd learn just a few rules of Hebrew pronunciation, as least the ones that lin­guists have written down. For now, it's fine to just fa miliarize yourself with the so-called <'sun letters, and their principle of assimilation. We'll do without printing the Hebrew letters here and just print their transcription in Latin letters, using the English transcription that's most common in magical literature. The Hebrew sun letters are the dental sounds and sibilants San1ekh (s), Shin (sh), and Daleth (d), as well as the sounds Resh (r), Lamed (l), and Nun. These assin1ilate the end consonants of the previous word, fo r example the '<I', of the previous article \"Af' (or «Et>'). Although the word fo r \"sun'' is written AL SHAMASCH, it's pronounced \"ASCH­SCHAMASCH, (the sun letters are called so because of this example word). Using the n1oon hexagram as an example, SHADDAI EL SHAI should correctly be spoken \"SHADDAl ASCH-SCHAI.\" We've already taken this into account in our description of the rituals, but won't explain it again. 1. Son1e competent authors (particularly journalists) have confused the hexagram with the pentagram in the past, and the other \\vay around as well. 'fhis is probably due to the fact that the hexagram is some­tinles referred to as a <<pentacle,,, which n1ay cause confusion among beginners. 2. If you,re not yet fa miliar with the kabba1istic Tree of Life, just skip this information fo r now since we,ll be dealing with it in more detail at a n1orc appropriate time. This kabbalistic inforn1ation is meant to serve as a reminder to those readers who have already nu:morized the symbolism of the Tree of Life so that they can now actually apply what thcy,ve learned. 3.

Now don't let this scare you into thinking you'll have to tu.rn your apartment into a magical house of horrors. Our list is just meant to serve as a complete reference, like many other things in this book, and in no way does it mean that every Western n1agician has all of these things, especially right from the start since obtaining or making these things usually takes years, if not decades. Plus, you usuaUy can't just order magical in­struments through a catalog, and even if you actually do sometimes, these instruments still need to be charged and subtly calibrated, which involves a considerable amount of effort. And after all, everyone knows that the true initiate has mastered the techniques of the empty hand. But in order to truly master these, experience has shown that about 90 percent of all beginning magicians need to learn how to work with physical tools first, which is what we,U be discussing here. Always keep in mind that magical t<?ols are merely symbolic aids that are meant to bring the magician,s spirit into a certain gnosis. By structuring one's universe externally as well as internally with symbols, one's creating \"anchors,, fo r various states of con­sciousness. One consciously projects part of one's self and then retrieves this part by working with it practically or epistemologically. Although this process can be under­stood as rationally and intellectually as just described, the act itself happens in an en­tirely different way. A person who looks at his or her dagger and consciously thinks \"You are the projection of my will and nothing more than a tool that I can just as easily do withouf, won't have much success when working with the dagger. After all, there's a rea­son why magic is sometimes called \"controlled schizophrenia,» although ((controlled projection, would probably be more fitting. This externalization (projection) must be absolute in order for it to develop its own momentum and become effective in the de­sired sense. On the other hand, this shouldn,t be carried too fa r so that magicians are completely helpless when they don,t have their own tools at hand or if they might even be lost. But paradoxically we can usually only gain this independence from our magical tools by working with them for so long that we,ve either internalized them or that they 120 Introduction to Ritual Magic (III)"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"really exist on a psychological level (astrally). Only a very fe w highly talented naturals are able to master the techniques of the empty hand right from the start, and often this n1astery is proceeded by yearlong training in other disciplines, such as yoga, meditation, autogenic training, alchemy, oriental martial arts, or others. Even such natural talents should still work thoroughly with physical tools in their magical practice, even if it's fo r the mere purpose of sufficiently grounding their own work and developing a fe eling fo r the various energy qualities. But why are material tools so effective? The psychological explanation says because they make an impression on the subconscious in a direct and subtle manner. The sub­conscious is commonly known to be a bit \"childish,, at times, at least in the opinion of our supposedly \"adult\" intellect. Like a child, it loves bright colors, powerful stimuli, and clear statements. It's no secret that many people have trouble with ritual work, especially at the beginning of their magical career. And certainly the significance of the ritual in magical work shouldn't be und-erestimated. Of course, there are other ritual-free fo rms and subdisciplines in magic that are just as effective and fa r less elaborate as we\"ve al­ready seen in the second section on sigil magic. But ritual offers us the opportunity to perceive the choreography of magical energies in a controlled situation as well as to cap­ture these and use them fo r our work. Moreover, only the ritual is able to calibrate the magician,s psyche with a lasting effect toward magical work, magical perception, and­probably most importantly magical .success. The importance of rituals and ritual objects can be seen in everyday life. No n1atter what kind of ritual we observe rituals of greeting, job promotions, anniversaries, award ceremonies, marriages, baptisms and fu nerals, political elections, military taps, or even the ritual structure of sporting events people are always busy performing synl­bolic acts with the intention of structuring their cosmos and making it comprehensible by creating points of reference and orientation, which in turn create opportunities fo r acting and maneuvering. In this sense., magical rituals are the logical and consequential continuation of a proven living technique that already governs our entire existence any­way. Of course, with the difference that we as magicians design our rituals ourselves fo r the most part, making them ideally more accurate and without letting them become re­duced to nothing but hollow, meaningless shells. In troduction to Ritual Magic (Ill) 121"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"In doing so, magical tools function both as an unconscious reminder and as an en­ergy storage medium fo r subtle powers. (Psychologically speaking, this is basically the same.) However, the fa ct that these objects often develop a strange life of their own can­not be explained entirely in psychological terms. But we'll get to that later. For now, let's have a look at the first item on our list the temple. THE MAGICAL TEMPLE The magical temple is a place where only magic is practiced. This is usually an isolated room or corner of the room that's dedicated to magical work. Many magicians don't de­cide to have their own temple until after many years of practice; until then, they may temporarily transform their living roon1 or bedroom into one fo r magical work. As the need arises, you'll have to decide fo r yourself how you want to solve the problem of a magical workplace; you've probably already fo und a solution if you've been doing the exercises given here. The reason why we've chosen to top our list with the most elaborate item is that creating a suitable temple is really no problem at aU if you,ve understood the concept behind it. Let's talk about what the ideal temple looks like so that you know what's important and what you can easily do without when planning your special spot. The ideal temple is a room that's only used fo r magic and otherwise remains closed. Only the magician is allowed to enter, or coiJeagues or clients whom he or she performs magical operations with. Curious outsiders have no business snooping in the temple­remember the esoteric oath to keep silent! The magician keeps one's temple in proper order, allowing no outsiders to clean there or possibly even pick up things. The temple should be well ventilated since the incense mixtures used during rituals can cause quite thick clouds of smoke. On the other hand, the temple doesn,t necessarily need to have a window since you usually work in the dark anyway (with few exceptions) since this aids concentration. The temple can be painted or designed in white or black or any other color that the magician fe els appropriate. According to our experience, a neutral black or white is best since the level of distraction is much less. Plus, these are so-called «noncolors, ( techni­cally speaking, ((uncolored\") that causes a certain energetic neutrality. Don't let those New Agers scare you into thinking that the color black can have '(negative effects.\" Maybe you could counter such a statement by saying that, optically speaking, every ob­ject is actually lacking the color that we associate with it. 122 Introduction to Ritual Magic (III)"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"In other words, a rose (( is)' not red red is much more the only color that it's not, since the rose emits this color. In some traditions, black is also the color of protection and concentration and magic. White, on the other hand, is the color of purity and per­meability as well as mysticism. But when in doubt, you should put more trust in your intuition than in spoon-fed color theories. However, if possible, avoid flowered wallpa­per or loud patterns that could distract your eyes or have an irritating effect on the rit­ual gnosis. The temple holds all of the equipment that the magician needs for one,s work, in­cluding the ritual instruments as mentioned above, but also candles, candleholders, in­cense mixtures, charcoal tablets, parchment (for talismans and amulets), string (for knot magic), crystal balls, and meditation pillows as well as the usual shelves, cabinets, or cupboards fo r storing these objects. The floor of the temple should be made of highly inflammable material since the incense often causes sparks. Any windows should either be covered or not transparent from the outside. That's aJl for the basic requirements, but this list can be expanded in any way you like. Most magicians prefer candJelight rituals, but some also like to work with electronic lighting effects, which require the proper equipment, of course. A person who prefers the romantic tradition completely without electricity won't even need a power socket. The size of the temple depends on the individual needs of the magician as well, de­pending on whether one mainly works alone or together with other magicians. In any case, the temple should at least be large enough for the altar (when available) and the n1agician to cast the circle around it. For classical demon evocations, additional space is needed outside the circle for a tri­angle. If all else fa ils, a closet will work, too, but a bit more comfort can,t hurt since n1ost of the magical gestures (such as the assumption of god-forms) require a certain amount of room to move, just like dancing fo r certain invocations does. Only those working in an angular tradition will need more furniture: an altar fo r the Wo rshipful Master, one table each fo r Senior and Junior Wa rdens, and an appropriate number of chairs. In the circular tradition, which will be our fo cus for now, the nlagi­cian generally stan� while occasionaUy sitting or kneeling on the floor in a meditative position. He or she usually fa ces the east, but the fu rnishings should be flexible enough to allow work in other directions as well.

The successful magical act ((M)) (or magic in general) is directly proportional to the degree of gnosis or magical trance applied, multiplied by the degree of the magical link to the goal or target person (when magically influencing others); \"M'' is reversely proportional to the degree of awareness of the magical act and the psychological resistance against this. The whole thing is then multiplied by the degree of coincidental probability of magical success. Let's break down this fo rmula to see what it means to magical practice. The fa ct that magical success depends on the magical trance (gnosis) applied was al­ready discussed earlier and should need no fu rther explanation. However, magical success is directly proportional to the degree of the magical link to the goal or target person. This is quite obvious in magic fo r influencing others. For ex­anlple, if a magician wants to heal or harm the target person, one needs appropriate ac­cess to this person. This is usually determined by or based on the first law of practical magic. This doctrine states that, fo r example, an object that has been with another per� son fo r a long tin1e assumes the qualities of this person, even becoming ((one, with him or her in a sense; in this way, the magician can treat this object as though it were the per­son. This is why the old grimoires often tell the magician to collect personal things from 128 Introduction to Ritual Magic (Ill)"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"onc,s target person such as nail clippings, locks of hair, blood, or other bodily secretions and fluids. The second law of practical magic is the law of transmission (aJso called ((con­tagion,) and fo rms the theoretical basis for actively working with an object in practical magic. If the magician has in one,s possession a piece of hair (or even a photo) from the target person, one can proceed in any desired way and this will bring about the effect that anything done to this object will also happen to the target person as well. The degree of such a link can vary greatly; it almost always depends decisively on how well the magician can find the rhythm of the energy field of one,s ta rget person. This is often a question of one's intuition and power of imagination and the tools needed to optimally perform one,s magical act. Son1e magicians can magically adjust to a person just by knowing his or her name, while others n1ay need n1ore comprehensive information and st ronger stimuli, fo r example by having seen, spoken with, or having touched the person, or by possessing a photo or other object from the target. In this we can see that the variable \"l, can only be determined quite subjectively, which naturally applies to the degree of gnosis as well. In this context, we need to remember that in order to charge a talisman or amulet, a magical link needs to be established. We can understand our ((magical link', as the degree of empathy (unison) between ourselves and the target person or object. In a theoretical sense, the relationship between the magician and target person can easily be established as such, but even the most ex­perienced magicians often have difficulties finding a \"conncction,l) fo r example to quench their desire fo r materia] or mystical success. 1 n fa ct, ((binding, basically means join­ing or even merging what we,re referring to here is our own centralization, which re­quires the line dividing our will from our magical goal be kept extremely fine or lifted completely. If our desire has become \"organic,(as Spare would say), and if it's centered yet at the same time vast enough to integrate our goal completely into our overall personality, we can call this a strong n1agical link. Like a samurai warrior, the magician has to becon1e one with one's goal in order to eliminate psychological fa ilure mechanisms. There is, however, a much more subtle aspect of the variable «I,\" namely the magician's actual suitability for the desired action, and there are indeed specialists in every field of magic, although every serious magician does one,s best to develop one's skills as flexibly as possible. But the magician,s suitability to achieve the desired goal plays a role here as weU. A person who has an unhealthy relationship to money will rarely be successful in n1oney Introduction to Ritual Magic (III) 129"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"magic; the same holds true for sex magic and magicians who don't have a grip on their normal, everyday sexuality. The person who tends to perform magic for love or attraction instead of for healing will need to apply more effort (and more tools) for magical operations in this weak area, and less in his or her area of strength. Mter all, modern magicians feel that the act of ob­taining an object for practical magic use is merely just one weapon for winn ing the bat­tle, but an act that's often n1ore significant than the actual result itself. The best magical link is surely a precise mental image of the desired goal or target person. Of course, «pre­cise,, in this case means emotional precision rather than physical. If a magician makes a doll to represent the ta rget person, it doesn't matter if this image looks exactly like him or her in every detail like a photograph, but rather it's much more important that a strong identity is established between the puppet and the target person. The best state of mind for doing this is what Spare calls ((noninterest/nondisinterest.\" Often dolls and other representative objects are made or charged for the sole purpose of steering the magician's concentration toward one's goal and increasing his or her focus on it. The variables ((a\" and \"r'' reduce the prospect of magical success. The awareness of the magical act is one of the greatest stumbling blocks for the beginner taking the first attempts at walking on the magical floor. With \"awareness'' we mainly mean the censor's conscious mental linking of the magical operation with the magical goal. Let's stick with the example of making a doll. Although a strong magical link needs to be established be­tween the doll and the target person, this identification needs to be «forgotten', during the actual magical operation. If you,re not able to detach yourself emotionally from the situation (we could call this intentional <'disidentification,), the censor will do everything in its power to prevent suc­cess in order to avoid the possible dilemma of having a bad conscience (\"I didn,t want to do that, \" \"I didn't mean it that way,'' \"I actually didn't deserve that\"), which often results in much more of a mental burden than magical failure would. Such self-consciousness could ruin everything. That's why it's absolutely necessary to thoroughly think through the situation beforehand, otherwise the consequences could be catastrophic.2 Rational, skeptical objections (\"That'll never work!,, ((I can,t do that,, ((How is that supposed to work?,,) can easily be eliminated through magical success, with few excep­tions. So unless you happen to live by Palmstrom-Morgenstern's motto \"And so he made 130 Introduction to Ritual Magic (Ill)"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"I • it his creed/that nothing can be what it cannot be,, your success will surely convince you soon enough that skepticism is not infallible and certainly has its limits. The «other,, variables include not feeling well physically or mentally C'lack of en­ergy,), lack of motivation or boredom (which often occurs when performing magic for others!), absent-mindedness (too much fo cus on subjective m�gical tasks that are viewed as more important), and more. Since these vary from situation to situation, there,s no general rule that applies to all. The variable (( p,, or the coincidental probability of magical success, is often underes­timated by beginners as well. This is probably due to the fa ct that the esoteric ideology of today treats the word ((coincidence', like a pariah without even realizing what any per­son with a healthy degree of common sense already fe els and knows, namely that our ac­tions as a magician are subject to certain limits. These limits are surely much fa rther away than we often think or want to believe, but it would be fo olish to view magic as a mere tool for fulfilling childish fa ntasies of playing God. Although it may theoretically be possible for a magician to make the physical planets Mars or Mercury explode by using one,s magical arts, such considerations are usually nothing more than intellectual gan1es that can be quite dangerous by leading to megalomania, which is in fa ct quite widespread among magicians. Let's take a quantitative example this time. Let's assume that the probability of a meteor crashing into a magician's temple in the next half hour is 1:1,000,000,000,000,000. Let's assume further that, with the help of intense gnosis, a high emotional affinity to the goal \"meteor crashes into temple,, an extreme low degree of awareness of the magical act, and low psychological resistance, the magician is able to \"raise,, this probability in his fa vor to 1: l ,000,000,000,000 (three less zeros), or if he,s a true master of his art maybe even to 1: 1, 000,000,000 (six less zeros). According to prob­ability this is a great fe at, and even from a scientific point of view it would be tremen­dous, but nonetheless magical success is still highly improbable. Certainly one could object to plenty of things in this example. Firstly, the probability of such a meteor crash (or even of magical success in general) could never be seriously calculated so precisely based on our current level of knowledge; secondly, there's no way to determine how many \"zeros, can be eliminated by magic; and thirdly, high probability or improbability can say nothing about whether a desired event may just happen anyway, because, as we know, statistics only deal with averages and not with individual or even Introduction to Ritual Magic (Ill) 131"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"subjective events, experiences, or impressions. Plus, the probability or improbability often cannot be determined until after magical success or fa ilure has taken place (and sometimes not even then), depending on the way in which it actually happens or does­n't happen. For example, one could perform magic to ensure that an inheritance that's aJready certain is received as soon as possible; but there might be a dispute involved and instead one might unexpectedly win the same amount of money in the lottery or by playing roulette. Such ((success on another lever' often reveals the limits of such models of thought, explanation, and illustration. Nonetheless, the basic statement of our fo rmula is fo unded on n1agicaJ experience­subjective as well as collective. 3 This once again clearly shows how senseless it is to want to replace the variables in our equation with actual numbers. Always remember that even the power of a magician is limited to his or her sphere of influence. Charging sigils fo r world peace or to elimi­nate fa mine n1ay give you a sense of paying a moral contri,bution, but this has little to do with common practice at most it could pacify a bad conscience. Along these lines, we,ve developed the ruJe that you should even use magic fo r a goaJ that's highly proba­ble to occur in the first place without magic, especia11y at the beginning of your magical career. If we persistently work our way up to more difficult tasks instead of trying to • jump there all at once, we)ll be able to deal with fa ilure (which is inevitable sometimes) much better on a psychoJogicaJ level since we,ve learned to take one step at a time. Let,s summarize this in short Ideally, the·values below the line should be zero because then the values above it would be \"infinite,, although this is rarely the case in practice. The greater the magical trance (<'g')) and magical link ('<1\"), the higher the success rate of the magical operation will be .. It's reduced by the variables ((a') and ''r.\" When the psychological and rational resistance C'r,,) to the magical act or its goal is higher, the magical link or value of((l, is automatically lower because the magical will is not organic enough, and alienation between the magician and the goal occurs instead of absolute unity. Yo u,ve probably noticed that our variables cannot always be clearly distinguished from one another anyway. In this sense, a high trance value means according to defin-132 Introduction to Ritual Magic (Ill) •"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"ition a limited amount of awareness, while resistance could be due to an insufficient magical link, and so on. Other equations would be possible as well, for example the vari­able ''r\" below the line could be replaced by another variable such as <<w,, (for ((magical will,). This is more than just an intellectual game since it creates many different psycho .. logical approaches to practical magic, so fe el free to experiment with other equations as well! THE MAGIC OF AUSTIN OSMAN SPARE Spare's sigil magic, which we'll mainly be dealing with in this section, is based on a mechanism that plays a key role in the psychology of Sigmund Freud: psychological re­pression. Roughly summarized, Freud's thesis claims that the psyche represses certain trauma, impulses, fe ars, and other parts of the conscious mind into the unconscious or subconscious fo r various reasons. This can lead to pathological behavior such as com­pulsiveness, neurosis, or psychosis. In other words, through repression, these compo­nents of the soul remain active only in the subconscious, but in no way do they lose . their effectiveness and, on the contrary, they can even fo rce the conscious mind to be­have in a seemingly rational manner that is, in reality, controlled by the subconscious: Spare's brilliant idea that he developed just after the turn of the nineteenth to the twentieth century a time when Sigmund Freud's work was only known to a tiny group of specialists in England didn't view this psychological mechanism as disturbing or undesired, seeking its elimination like the ((father of psychoanalysis, did,5 but rather rec­ognized it in an entirely pragmatic sense as being predefined and therefore quite practi­cal fo r magical use. Spare's contribution can be measured by looking at the history of psychoanalysis and depth psychology in the twentieth century and their tremendous in­fluence on the thought patterns of our time. Freud's model was pathologically oriented through and through; he and his colleagues fe lt that repression was merely something to be rejected and even reversed in order to free the person from unconscious obsessions and fears and, in this way, to rid the patient of pathogenic disturbances (((illnesses,). Freud,s students, fo llowers, successors, and academics all took this approach from Al­fred Adler and C. G. Jung to Georg Groddek. Even William Reich was mainly concerned with the elimination and prevention of mental illness. Although nearly all of Freud,s great students eventually fo llowed different paths than their old master of modern psy-Introduction to Ritual Magic (Ill) 133"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"chology did with some of these paths even crossing over into the realms of magic (such as C. G. Jung,s) the possibility of ((reversely using, the psychological process of repression was never seriously considered. This was reserved fo r Austin Osman Spare, who developed one of the most economical and most effective disciplines of the Black Arts, namely \"sigil magic\" that we've already mentioned here quite frequently. Spare's train of thought was thusly. If the psyche represses certain impulses, desires, fears, and so on, and these then have the power to become so effective that they can mold or even determine entirely the entire conscious personality of a person right down to the most subtle detail, this 1neans nothing more than the fa ct that through repression (\"forgetting\") many impulses, desires, etc. have the ability to create a reality to which they are denied access as long as they're either kept alive in the conscious n1ind or re­called into it. Under certain conditions, that which is repressed can become even more powerful than that which is held in the conscious mind. Such cons,iderations almost automatically created the desire to constructively use this mechanism of psychological power instead of wanting to eliminate, reverse, or avoid it. Spare believed that intentionally repressed material would become enormously effective in the same way that «unwanted\" (since not consciously provoked ) repressions and con1plexes have tremendous power over the person and his or her shaping of real­ity. It was a logical conclusion to view the subconscious mind as the source of all magi­cal power, which Spare soon did. In his opinion, a magical desire cannot becon1e truly effective untiJ it has become an organic part of the subconscious mind. This can defi­nitely be understood in a physical sense as weU, which is why Spare plausibly placed great importance on personal magical posture {mudras). But it wasn't Spare's only achievement to develop a theoretical basis based on psy­choanalysis fo r the process of magical action; his ideas also enabled this process (a) to be more thoroughly understood and (b) to be used much more efficiently than Western magic did previously up to the nineteenth century. In fa ct, he developed the technique of controlled repression that we know today as sigil magic. Lees summarize this once again fo r clarity. Spare's system of making the desire ((or­ganic\" can be defined as a technique of conscious repression. Each and every desire is re­pressed in1mediately and not aJiowed to stay in the conscious mind fo r any period of 134 Introduction to Ritual Magic (III)"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"time. Once embedded in the subconscious, this desire acts like a complex, fu nctioning independently while striving toward fulfillment.\" The magician who works according to Spare,s method uses the repression mecha­nisnl of the psyche to one,s advantage. By purposely repressing the desired goal, one takes advantage of the psychological fulfilln1ent automatisn1 and fo rces the subcon­scious to bring about the desired effect against the potential resistance of the conscious mind and censor. A process that Freud and his fo llowers would probably call pathologi-cal now becomes an instrument fo r magicaJ action that guarantees success fo r the most part. • Ifs vital that you understand this process clearly since this fo rms the basis of all laws of modern magic; we,ll continue to find these ideas again and again in both theoretical and practical magic. Of course, we don,t want to make the fa lse impression that Freud's thesis was in­tended fo r magic in even the slightest way. In fa ct, Spare borrowed many ideas from psy­chology and implemented some of these fo r developing contemporary magic, in the same way many other magicians in the twentieth century have done (such as Aleister Crowley, Dion Fortune, William Gray, WiUiam Butler, Israel Regardie, and others). Many old magical techniques are celebrating new triumphs today in the light of psy­chology without magic being reduced to merely a somewhat bizarre variety of appl.ied psychology, which we'll realize again and again throughout our practice. However, Spare's system in no way intends to prevent or demonize desire as such fo r moral reasons such as Buddhism and other ascetic doctrines do. Rather, the desire should be repressed in order to make it capable of being fu lfilled. The demons of one's own psyche will take care of this fulfillment. However, after all that being said, ifs obvi­ous that such methods require a very robust psyche in the first place. The subconscious reacts to suppression and prohibition/self-denial like a child des­perately trying to get what he or she wants. Plus, this technique has the advantage that the intellect remains turned off (such as when charging a sigil) regarding the contents of the desire, and its fulfillment cannot be prevented by fa ntasies, rational thought, objec­tions, figments of the imagination, daydreams, doubt, or genuine fe ar of possible success by limiting its means of manifestation right from the start. This is also another fo rn1 of Introduction to Ritual Magic (Ill) 135"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"the Crowleyan den1and to \"be free of the desire fo r results,, which can also be fo und in similar fo rm in karma yoga and Zen, just to name a fe w more examples. So when using Spare,s technique of repression, the wish or desire must first be suffo­cated, then separated from the self and fed with energy so that it's able to carry out its job. There are authors who fe el that the desire needs to be energized first, and that sim­ply fo rgetting (repressing) it isn,t enough to guarantee magical success. This can diffe r from magician to magician. Energizing occurs through the actual charging, fo r example by means of the death posture. However, one can often observe even among non practi­tioners of magic that the desires most likely to come true are those that often surface in the conscious mind fo r just a fraction of a subjective second, only to immediately disap­pear again and be covered up by other material of the consciousness. Surely you can think of a few examples of this process from yo ur own experience, fo r example when you briefly thought about calling a certain person and fo rgot about it right away and then the phone rang! Yo u might want to call this telepathy, but this attempt at explanation wouldn't work for unexpected situations of\"luck\" (such as winning money, an unpopu­lar colleague or superior being unable to work, spontaneous healing, sudden gifts or pre­sents), which would very clearly seem to be dealing with the mechanism described above. Now let's look at the magical technology of Spare's system. It's based unconditionaUy on the so-called \"neither-neither principle:' This principle is based on the realization that there is no truth (and no wish, want, or desire) thafs not balanced by an equally true opposite. Only our individual outlook and our material and psychological circumstances have the power to choose what will appear to us as ((more true', fo r the time being. The neither-neither principle leads directly to a magical tech­nique that Spare described as \"free belief., We decided to integrate this technique into our training program, and you,ll find a detailed description of it in the practical exer­cises of this section. With the technique of free belief, the magician can achieve an un­differentiated energy potential since it's separated from the original \"meaning.\" We've al­ready introduced this concept in Exercise 10.7 Sometimes this is also called \"aleatory, (determined by luck) instead of \"free,, belief, fo r example when we perform this technique with the help of a die.�t Of course, this technique of free or aleatory belief has more than just the one effect of eliminating re­strictions: These beliefs offs et each other and thereby create the metapolar energies that hold the true secret to any fo rm of sigil magic. 136 Introduction to Ritual Magic (Ill) • • • i •"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"CHARGING THE SIGIL WITH THE DEATH POSTURE9 Before we wrap up this first part of our special section on the magic of Austin Osman Spare, we,d first like to talk more about the techniques fo r charging sigils. First of all, we need to clarify that charging a sigil doesn,t mean charging it with magical energy, but rather it can be compared to installing a program on to the \"central computer subconscious., The closer the sigil is to being machinelike meaning the more it corresponds to the subconscious in terms of language and content the easier it can be decoded; the program will then be activated in the background (multitask­ing)) allowing the finished res ults to be delivered to the application program (everyday consciousness). In Spare,s system, charging generally occurs with the so-called death posture, which we already described earlier in-depth. But we'd like to expand on that a bit further. ((The death posture is as much an act as it is a position. The wizard postures death [ ... } By forcing his ego to mimic death, the wizard can 'stand back' to see the powers that ener­gize his own and others' actions and so learn how he can best work to carry out his will.» Ifs therefore a method of magical objectivity. \"He will make his thought as still as his body by accepting all contraries, uniting op­posites in annihilation.,, In fact, a feeling of annihilation actually does occur, as well as a fe eling of power and its expansion. Hereby the mind should be stilled and kept in the state of \"neither-neither.'' In this way, we eliminate every possible inner disunity by ex­panding our \"self\" to include absolutely everything. Only constant practice can lead to what Spare calls \"the center of desire,, which cannot be defined fu rther with normal means. In Spare's own words, the death posture is \"a simulation of death by the utter nega­tion of thought, i.e., the prevention of desire and the functioning of all consciousness through the sexuality.\" Because through sexuality we connect with IGa, as Spare de­scribed the Absolute.10 However, ifs important to point out that the death posture has nothing to do with the actual physical death of the magician: \"It is one thing to simulate a death agony, quite another to stimulate one.\" Although it can safely be accompanied by a bit of sweat and tears, anything that may be damaging to your health should be avoided.

Then the daily amount of practical training will be lessened slightly for awhile, which will create a training cycle with alternate phases of in ner reflection and phases of frequent activity. 142 Planetary Magic (II) •"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"THE MAGICAL ROBE When magicians enter their ci rcle (or cast it), they're protected fr om everything that might interfere with their work. This is their entrance into \"another world,\" the realm of magical energies and entities. When ordinary people enter \"another world\" within their everyday life, they per­form certain rituals. They might take more time getting ready, perform washing cere­monies and anointments, and choose ((festive', clothing an evening gown, a tuxedo, or just their \"Sunday best.'' This is a way of announcing to the outside world that a differw ent, norteveryday state of being or consciousness is about to be entered. The same is true in a magical ritual. Magicians document their entrance into the magical state of consciousness not only by ceremonial washing and anointment, but also and especially by changing their clothing. This technique generally takes on two forms: ( 1) Either the magician works completely naked, or (2) one wears clothing that's reserved only for magical work. There's not much more to say about item l except that it's not only a matter of taste, but may also depend on climatic or weather conditions. After all, the mere act of working \"sky-clad\" (as some Wiccans calls it) can lead to a state of altered consciousness, especially in group work. 143"},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"If the magician works in a group, a uniform type of clothing will ensure the anonymity of all participants, which can be especially helpful to accept the others while working with n1agicaJ invocations. For example, it's no longer your friend Carl Miller who suddenly speaks to you as Mercury, but rather an anonymous human vehicle fo r this planetary power· therefore, by working in a standard magical ((uniform,'' you're robbing the censor of a possible target and the effect of this shouldn't be underestimated. One important function of working unclothed or uniformed in a group has always been the elimination of any social contrasts because, during a ritual, all participants are equal within the framework of the individual role that they play. If the magician works alone, however, which is usually the case, he or she can choose either option according to one's preference. Aleister Crowley introduced a certain mechanism that, when varied slightly, can be applied to all magical equipment. On the one hand, he gave precise instructions for ob­taining a magical robe, but on the other hand, he said that the magician can even work in a bathrobe just as effectively as long as ifs only used for that purpose. As you see, it doesn't matter whether you adhere strictly \"to the rules\" concerning your magical equip­ment, as long as your subconscious is calibrated to associate it with your magicaJ work. A lot of nonsense has been written about the magical robe that does nothing but fill the beginner with uncertainty instead of explaining what this piece of clothing is actu­ally about. First of all, this piece of clothing is quite simple, which can aid the magician's concentration in itself. The second purpose of the robe (which is equally important) is the protection it gives, although concentration and protection basically have the same function. This magical protection is understood as the el imination of undesired ener­gies, while concentration is the elimination of undesired thoughts. Symbolically, the robe also stands for the magician,s aura since it conceals oneself and his or her inten­tions, or concentrates them inside. With its help, the magician makes oneself invisible or unidentifiable to the profane outside world. This anonymity will guarantee that one,s everyday ego (or censor) won't get in the way. The magician is usually naked underneath the robe because this symbol of the magical art is the only bulwark one has against ob­trusive influences and the powers conjured that can be quite dangerous at times. The robe is the most classical piece of magical clothing. It's usually tau-shaped. 1 The sleeves get gradually wider toward the cuffs, and their length usuaUy reaches to the mid­dle of the hand. The lower part of the robe should either reach to the middle of the calf 144 Introduction to Ritual Magic (N)"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"or to the ankles. The robe should have no pockets. The simplest and most common forn1 of the magical robe has no opening at the front and just slips over the head. A robe with a front opening, which usually runs vertically down the center, is technically called a magical coat. The opening can be closed with buttons or snaps, although some mod­ern magicians even use Velcro. The coat is often used by magical lodges, but also in sex magic operations where the genitals need to be exposed but complete nakedness is not desired. For reasons of simplicity, we'll no longer make a distinction between the robe and coat since their function is the same. Traditionally, the robe is made of pure black silk since black is the color of concen­tration and repellence and silk is a good insulator. For theonic and mystic work, a white robe made of linen (flax linen) is often used (generally without a hood), although most magicians usually only have one all-purpose robe that's not always made of silk syn­thetic materials are fa irly common as well. After all, pure silk is definitely not cheap so when the magician decides on the material fo r his robe, ifs fine for him to take his wallet into consideration as well. Extremely ambitious magicians use different colored robes fo r various operations, fo r example a different color fo r each planet, but experience has shown that this is certainly not necessary. A silk robe has the advantage of being able to keep you either warm or cool as necessary, ifs comfortable on your skin, it can be fo lded and stored easier, and ifs more space-saving than most other cloth robes. Plus, depending on the type of silk, it doesn,t weigh very much. Some dogmatic schools require the robe to be made of aU-natural materials; in this case, it should be sewn with natural yarn. 'The traditional robe also has a hood that's either sewn directly to the robe which is usually the case or is attached as needed by means of safety pins, snaps, or other types of fa steners. The hood can either be round or pointed and should extend well beyond the edge of the fa ce when wearing it. To cover the fa ce, which is required sometimes in group rituals, the magician usually uses a veil that's attached to the front edge of the hood, or else a mask. Both cover the fa ce entirely, usually just leaving slits for the eyes. According to tradition, the robe should never be washed to prevent its ((astral impreg­nation', from being lost. In fa ct, the scents that a robe naturally attracts during hard work (such as incense, sweat, anointing oils, and so on) can even help the magician enter a state of magical trance since they can trigger mechanisms of association in the subconscious mind; such associations can reduce the time required in preparatory meditation to a Introduction to Ritual Magic (IV) 145"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"minimum, although at the cost of bodily hygiene (which is overly exaggerated in our so­ciety anyway). Generally, the robe should remain undecorated, although the magician may prefer to decorate it with personal symbols or the grade of his magical order. Most magicians keep their robe in a square or round bag, which, for practical rea­sons, is usually made out of the same material as the robe itself, sewn from remnants. The bag should be large enough to hold the hood, the belt, and the sandals as well. But more important than the material and cut of the robe is the rule (according to Western tradition) that this magical item of clothing, as well as all other magical tools, should only be used for magical purposes. At first we can even use a piece of clothing that we already have, as long as we no longer use it for everyday wear. The purpose of this rule is to program your subconscious into associating the robe only with magical work and gnosis, which isn't easy to do if, for example, the robe is worn to a costume party right after a rituaJ like some initiates of the Golden Dawn supposedly once didF THE BELT The belt is wrapped around the robe and tied in a knot; usually it hangs down the side a bit (up to around the middle of the thigh or to the knee). The belt can be colored according to the magician's symbolism; fo r example, a white belt and black robe would be appropriate fo r magically working with the polarities of existence, or a red belt could be used fo r sex magic operations, or an appropriately colored belt could be used fo r planetary work. It can be made of any material although cord is most common, but leather or silk is often used as well. Symbolic knots can give the belt an additional meaning, such as three knots for Saturn work or a knot for trapping or storing magical energies or states of • consctousness. One variation of the belt is the sash, which is usually made of silk and decorated with magical symbols. It often has a function similar to that of the headband and can serve to cover the solar plexus. Another symbol of the belt or sash can be interpreted as <'discipline,\" the discipline that's required of a magician in order for him or her to practice one's art, his or her un­yielding will, and his or her centeredness are all represented by the belt, which is really a magical circle wrapped tightly around one's body. 146 In troduction to Ritual Magic (IV)"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"THE HEADBAND The headband protects or activates the magician's third eye, and can be viewed as a sort of \"energetic burning glass.\" It can be made of any material; leather or velvet is most common, but silk is used occasionally too. The headband can be made of any color, such as the color corresponding to a planet for planetary work, but if the magician only uses one headband it's usually the same color as the robe. It can also be decorated with magical symbols, such as the magician,s personal sigil (((astral seal''), and sometimes precious or semiprecious stones or even small metal plates are used. The moonstone, for example, could be used for invocations of the moon and divination to strengthen visual perception. Mythical symbols can also be used on the headband, such as an Egyptian uraeus snake of pure gold. In the same way the belt tightens and disciplines the middle of the body, the headband does the same to the head, and therefore, according to Western symbolism, to the spirit and thought. Whoever has ever worn a headband knows the fe eling of security and concentration that it gives. Of course, it shouldn't be too tight but also not too loose. Light pressure should be fe lt, but it shouldn't be too uncomfortable or leave any deep impressions on the skin. (Among some native tribes, it's a common practice to use an extremely tight headband to reach a certain state of trance, but this requires a great deal of experience and careful observation, which is why we warn against such practices here.) THE SANDALS The sandals are actually quite ((old-fashioned') magical accessories that are seldom used today. Most magicians prefer to work barefoot, which syn1bo1ically means that they lit­erally have both fe et on the ground and arc utilizing the powers of the earth. Such grounding is occasionally frowned upon, especially in so-called \"theonic, -oriented cir­cles that are ultratraditional and dogmatic and are characterized by having an extreme aversion to their bodies and the material world, with their highest goal being to exalt the spirit and overcome the body. But this doesn,t concern us, so we won,t go into it any furt her. Traditionally, sandals are usually made of leather and meant to symbolize a firm grip that the magician has in one's art, and they protect one's fo ot chakras from chthonic (subterranean) powers as well.' Introduction to Ritual Magic (IV) 147"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"On the other hand, they're also considered a symbol of Mercury and Hermes who were messengers of the gods and known to have worn winged sandals. In this sense, san­dals can also be a symbol for the swiftness and mobility of a magician (or one's ability of astral travel). This is just another example of how magical symbols can often be interpreted and used quite subjectively; only their basic structures are not arbitrary and are relatively fixed. This freedom of interpretation may confuse the beginner at first, but it offers the experienced magician a great deal of practical versatility. • 148 PRACTICAL EXERCISES EXERCISE 15 TRAINING YOUR CONCENTRATION AND ATTENTION This exercise serves to improve your concentration and attention. Al­though we like to try to avoid exercises that seem to have no direct relation to practical magic, the importance of the foUowing exercise shouldn't be underestimated. This exercise demands the magician,s attention to seem­ingly meaningless details, which is important in the practice of magic as well. Write a letter to any person. It can be a person who,s either alive or dead, real or fictitious, or even an animal, a mythical figure or other crea­ture.

As you know, \"it's the little things that counf' and this holds true in working with states of altered consciousness as well .. Especially in the be­ginning, it's vital that you learn to recognize these countless components of your reality and their significance. Only then can we actually become ((master builders', (as Freemasons say) of our reality, not overlooking the «little,, details in our quest for finding overall correlations, and treating these just as carefully and respectfully as the entire thing. EXERCISE 16 PENDULUM TRAINING (1) If you don't already have one, get yourself a pendulum. Shape and size are unimportant fo r the time being; at first, you can even use a key or ring tied to a piece of string as long as the pendulum isn't too heavy. (A builder's plumb bob is usually too heavy.) You can find a wide variety of good pen­dulums in New Age specialty shops; spiral pendulums usually react most sensitively, are relatively light, and can be made of various materials (e.g., brass, copper, or sometimes even silver or gold). But the most important thing is that you find a pendulum that you like., Collect several photographs of men and women (clippings from mag­azines will work in a pinch as well). Only one person should be pictured on each photo. Place the photos fa cedown on the table and mix them up well enough so that you can,t recognize them from the back side. To help you forget, you might even want to leave them on the table for awhile (even a fe w hours) before you continue. Now sit comfortably in front of the pictures and rest your elbow on the table so that your forearm is vertically straight. Hold the pendulum between your middle and forefinger and let it hang about one to two Introduction to Ritual Magic (IV) 149"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"inches above the first photo. Wait until the pendulum stops moving. Then ask the penduJum whether the person on the first photo is male or fe male. Let the pendulum swing freely but never try to help it along. If you really want, you can suggest to yourself that the pendulum should move, fo r ex­ample, counterclockwise fo r a fe male and clockwise fo r a male, but it's re­ally better if you experiment and discover yo ur own individual patterns of movement. Write down your successes and fa ilures. Don)t repeat this exer­cise too frequently or you,ll get tired too fa st; two or three times a week fo r fifteen minutes each is plenty fo r the start. Don,t be disappointed if you don't get the best results at first. This fo rm of subtle or magical perception often takes time and practice.6 EXERCISE 17 APPLIED PARADIGM SHIFTING IN PRACTICE (11)7 Ta ke something that you're absolutely convinced is true; either wait until you can convince yourself of something, or take an example of a doctrine or belief that you're already convinced of. Then swear to yourself that the opposite is true until both have neutralized each other.

Here are some concrete examples: a) Yo u completely believe in reincarnation. ((Missionize', yourself until you completely reject any theory of reincarnation, believing it to be nothing but humbug. However, aU of your contemplations should be rationally fo unded. Then proceed according to step c. b) On the other hand, if you're completely convinced of the value of homeopathy, turn into an fa natic allopathist fo r a while (at least fo r a few weeks). 150 In troduction to Ritual Magic (N)"},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"c) Then return to your original viewpoint and analyze it by using the new insights you,ve gained (or the fa naticism that you've just toiled to rid yourself of), and repeat this exercise until you,re able to sup­port any possible position at any time without your previous insis­tence of absoluteness. Working with scientific truths requires a certain amount of background knowledge; at first you should stick to those areas you already know a lot about. These could even be trite things, or emotionally charged ((truths, that usually seem more like habits than anything else. For example, a per­son who absolutely loves horseback riding might develop a temporary aversion to this pastime, or a person who,s fa natic about the Japanese cul­ture may concentrate on the negative aspects of it for awhile, while a de­termined heterosexual may focus on homosexuality, and so on. We don,t want to dictate exactly what areas you should choose for this exercise; even any time periods stated are merely recommendations. How­ever, for the start it would be wise to stick to one certain paradigm for at least a week (if not longer) since frequent paradigm shifting from one day to the other (or, as practice soJnetimes re quires, one second to another!) can cause certain difficulties for the beginner. With the help of this exercise, you'll find it much easier to comprehend the hodgepodge of different symbolic elements thafs typical to Western magic; for example, using kabbalistic formulas for the assumption of Egyptian god-forms while reciting Indian n1antras and ancient Greek hymns. It will save you the trouble of first having to fa miliarize yourself with every single area these symbols are taken fr om. That's why we recommend that you practice this exercise as often as you can and not a minute of your time will be wasted! Make sure you write down any observations about your states of con­sciousness. Your goal is to achieve the undifferentiated (not fixed) energy potential, which is the source of all magic, as we've mentioned before.

In any case, avoid the sun ritual for now since it requires thorough experience with all of the other planetary powers first, as we'll discuss in the next section in more detail. FolJow the basic structure of the planetary rituals listed below, but leave out numbers 4 and 5 (which is why they're in brackets). Here>s how you should proceed: 1.

Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram (with license to depart) Feel free to meditate on the planetary powers in any way you like; at first you'll probably just be concentrating on memorizing their characteristics and qualities. That's just fine for this stage in your training. Dismissing the planetary powers at this stage means just letting them fa de away or saying a short word of thanks.

In the opinion of some modern au­thors, it's only necessary for extreme magical operations. Stephen Mace, for example, says it's only needed for (a) blood sacrifices and (b) the evocation of spirits and demons to the point of physical appearance. He fe els that the protection of the magician's aura is more important here.lf ifs \"hardened,'' the magician needs no other special protective ritual: '<A bright, firm aura, hardened by years of regular banishing and blazing under the force of a wizard's words of power, is his best protection against obsession, posses­sion, and psychic attack.\" No matter how reluctant the beginner is, the key phrase to the above quotation is \"years of regular banishing.» Only after years of practice can magicaJ protection become an automated process, which can often be seen in great magicians and shamans al­though they may no longer do any regular exercises anymore.9 However, the \"passion,', which is equally as important, can only be obtained through intense, dedicated practice. Not until magic has become a passion that's satisfying and fulfilling, and when you have no choice but to answer the question «Why do you do all • that?, like Carlos Castaneda,s Don Juan («Because there's no other way to live,), only then can you expect magic to become an automated or integrated function that com­pletely reprograms the censor, which turns magic into a daily matter of fa ct and tinkers within the same way magic is used to tinker with your profane reality. But with passion we don,t mean the overhasty enthusiasm of the beginner who,s so thrilled with the new world that has suddenly opened up to him or her through magic that one often takes the tenth step before the first and scoffs at words like ((patience, and \"persistence,, and who often takes a hard fa ll just as suddenly as it all can1e, losing am­bition as soon as it turns into hard work. It's not the short-lived spark but the roaring fire deep in your soul that will really make you progress in magic; ifs the secret pound­ing of your heartbeat saying «I want, I want, I want, that makes you st rive for more: for perfection, for mastery, and for completion, even if this is as fa r away as the end of our galaxy or our universe. Regardless of these psychological considerations, there are a number of magical ex­ercises that can be used for hardening the aura and constructing an automatic warning Introduction to Ritual Magic (IV) 153"},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"signal system. The first exercise that we,re already fa miliar with is the Kabbalistic Cross, and the second is the Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram.

Further recommen­dations are listed in the practical exercises section. So even if it's a bit early to present the heretical idea that magical circles are «basically unnecessary,, apart fr om a few special operations,'1 we don't intend to downplay your magical practice so fa r or cause mass confusion. But rather our intention is to give you a quick look into the future of what magical practice has in store for us as magicians and which course our ship should actually be taking. The techniques alone are no guarantee for magical protection and successful magic. Only persistent practice itself could even come close to guaranteeing this. The fa ct that there are so many different magical systems in the world that are all equally effective just proves that it's not important what the magician actually does during one,s training, but how and last but not least how long one actually does it. Nonetheless, even thirty years of training won't lead to any kind of success if the basic approach is wrong and magical perception is never developed. • l. Named after the Greek letter tau, which resembles a T fo rm. • 2. This rule is generally heeded worldwide with one exception the Afro-American religions of Voodoo, Macumba, Candomble, and Santeria, which occasionally use everyday items such as kitchen knives and plates. These religions work with the trance techniques of intentional possession and full trance meth­ods that Western magic tends to avoid since it's extremely difficult to control. In these religions, contin­ual charging is neglected, which means that rituals are often held fo r days on end until the actual goal of the ceremony has been achieved. 3. Interestingly, these are the powers that shamans actually prefer working with. This example alone illus­trates the strong ideological contrast between \"primitive, tribes and \"technocentric\" cultures! 4. It might make sense to let a neutral friend proofread the letter once or twice since our goal here is to achieve objective and not subjective perfection. 5. Beginners, if you,vc never worked with a pendulum before fo r an extended period of time) you'll have to get accustomed to it first. Remember that the pendulum represents a direct link to your subconscious and needs to be trained.

Not every magician is good with the pendulum. Some may be much better with a dowsing rod, fo r ex­ample. In this case, the magician could use any type of rod instead of the pendulum.

The Sanskrit word mantra basically means ((magical mystical phonetic formula,, and has been a permanent part of the language of Western esotericism for a good hun­dred years. Mantra meditation is a highly complicated subject that we'll be touching on again and again in the course of this book without ever possibly being able to exhaust it. How­ever, if we can only understand the basic structure of magical mantras, we'll be able to effectively utilize the magic of sound in our work without any great deal of knowledge about religion and linguistic history. Every mantra used magically serves mainly one purpose: to induce gnosis or a state of magical trance. For now we don,t need to concern ourselves with the extremely com­plicated theories that characterize Indian and Hebrew mantra meditation. Ifs enough to ren1ember that, in Hindu and Jewish traditions (but not only here), Sanskrit and He­brew were considered to be among the ccprimeval languages of creation.\" Sanskrit in par­ticular was considered to be a source of power in Hindu culture and its mastery was thought to make the magician divine. '' In the beginn ing was the word\"; this biblical quotation can be applied here quite well; the person who masters the subtle energies of 157"},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"such a sacral and ritual language can become a creator. Similar thoughts can be found in Hebrew and Latin, and at times such power has also been ascribed to the Arabic used in the Koran. This is the macrocosmic approach. The microcosmic approach is more concerned with the effect that mantras have. Lefs forget for awhile about the thesis of the \"objective'' power that mantras contain and experiment with the effects that can be achieved with certain mantras. We don't want to deny the fa ct that some literature on mantra meditation even warns against such \"pro­fane use\" of mantras. But experience has shown that in such cases these sources gener­ally support a dogmatic-religious perspective that has nothing to do with practical ex­perience in magic. • For now we're not interested at all in the \"meaning, that a certain mantra might have. Strangely, we even agree with the dogmatic-religious practitioners of mantra medi­tation when they say that the \"holy, mantras have a meaning of their own that's entirely beyond the comprehension of the person who uses it.2 For now, the important thing to remember is that mantras are combinations of sounds used for the following purposes: a) bringing about gnosis b) bringing about magical effects They have other functions as well, including: c) blocking out disruptive external influences d) increasing concentration e) causing a state of empty mind f) improving magical powers and perception Some parts of a) automatically overlap with c)-f) but there's no need to go into detail on that right now. In practice we,ll notice that there,s quite a difference whether we use Hebrew, San­skrit, Tibetan, Arabic, or Japanese mantras all of these languages have a unique, un­mistakable energy quality and therefore cause different forms of gnosis. We'll have the opportunity to experiment with this soon. 158 Mantra Meditation (I)"},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"Before we wrap up our first section on mantra meditation for now, we'd like to touch on the various ways of using mantras (called '<japa mantra'' in Sanskrit). In gen­eral, Indian tradition says there are three ways to intone mantras: 1) loudly 2) softly 3) silently Silent or mental intonation is considered in many mantra schools to be the (( highest\" form, although this most likely describes the subtleness of the energy involved and isn,t meant to be a moral evaluation. Logically, the type of intonation used should be chosen according to the purpose. The comparatively subtle energy achieved through silent or mental intonation isn,t always desired, so we should think functionally and choose ac­cordingly. As a ruJe of thumb, intoning mantras loudly can block out external impulses and enable a state of trance, while soft intonation is best for concentration and self- re­flection; silent intonation, on the other hand, creates the spiritual-astral detachment from the physical body. As we already know from sigil magic, the magician can create one,s own mantras (or acoustic sigils) and \"words of power.,, Although these mantras are created from one's common everyday language, they're abstracted in such a way that they no longer resem­ble it in the end. To wrap up this theoretical section, let's move on now to the practice of mantric sig­ils, which will help us prepare step by step for our practical work with traditional mantras later on. I. The religious cosmos isn't meant to be explored independently (that would be sacrilege) but rather ifs meant to be tolerated and accepted in this sense, it's aJso static. The magical cosmos, on the other hand, is dynamic and knows (at least ideaUy) no fixed laws and can only be explored through the magician's own personal experience. In a sense, this magical cosmos is even created this way in the first place. 2. In the same sense, it would be wise from a magical point of view to keep Latin as the language used in Catholic Mass, and many members of the church felt the same right up to the Second Council.

Now we'd like to in­troduce the mantric sigil method. As opposed to the word method, mantric sigils are usually not charged or activated spasmodically, but rather through rhythmic, monoto­nous recitation.' This method has both advantages and disadvantages. Probably the most significant disadvantage is the amount of time required for the operation. Using spasmodic charging (the word and picture method), the entire magical operation takes just a fe w minutes, while reciting sigils can often involve hours or even days of work. Plus mantric sigils arc more noticeable at least when they,re recited out loud and not silently, which is generally the rule. That's why they can't really be activated unless you have your privacy. But there are advantages as well. Firstly, many magicians fe e) that mantric sigils are more ((organic', and don't just \"hit your head with a sledgehammer, like sigils charged with the word or picture method often do. Secondly, the monotonous repetition of seemingly meaningless mantras often opens some magicians, subconscious minds much further than the death posture does which sex magic charging often achieves as well. Thirdly, mantric activation generally works well for magicians who already have some experience with methods of verbal suggestion or hypnosis, and auditory people such as 161"},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"musicians often have success with this method as well. Fourthly, remember that even mantric sigils are most effective when you forget what they,re about. As opposed to other methods of sigil magic, reciting mantric sigils has the advantage that you auto­maticaUy forget or repress its meaning after awhile.2 Furthermore, using only the vowels /, A, and 0 when intoning mantric sigils has proven most effective. For some reason it seems that the subconscious reacts better to these sound combinations. Below you'll find a modern exercise that's based on the ancient gnostic lAO formula and specifically utilizes its effects. Maybe you should experiment with mantric sigils a bit by using diffe rent intonations for the same operation. For example, you could use the acoustic sigil c' BILAKO, on the first day, \"BALAKA\" the next, and \"BELUKO, the fo llow­ing day while paying attention to which vowel combination fe els best. The order of the vowels 1-A-0 doesn't always have to stay the same; we can mix them up any way we like (e.g., 0-A-1, 1-0-A, A-0-J), which the ancient gnostics did as well. THE lAO FORMULA Lots has been written about the so-called lAO formula, although it's not always easy to define exactly what this means in a magical sense. The vowel combination 1-A-0 played an important role in late ancient gnosticism, and even AJeister Crowley liked to use it a lot.3 We don't want to get into the philosophical and symbolic meaning of the lAO for­mula just yet since personal experience and practice is much more important right now. Besides, we also want to prove that a majority of magical techniques will work automat­ically without a lot of ideological background knowledge or philosophical «facts,, as long as the appropriate state of gnosis is reached. Instead of making a bunch of philosophical-mystical statements here, I'd rather in­troduce a practical exercise that I designed myself and explain it in detail. It's an energizing and protection exercise with effects similar to those of the Kabbal­istic Cross, but not as complicated and in some ways even more effective.

EXCU'RSION: A MAGICIAN'S VULNERABILITY (1) The magician Gurdjieff dedicated his entire life to \"the war against sleep,\" as he called it. This is, by the way, the title of a study on Gurdjieff by Colin Wilson thafs well worth reading. He understood sleep to be something similar to what the ancient gnostics be­lieved living in the nonawareness of one,s true destination. Searching for the answers to the three gnostic questions (((Who am I? Where did I come from? Where am I going?\") means waking up fron1 what Colin Wilson called \"habitual neurosis.\" In contrast to earlier times, only a handful of magicians still believe that there,s a general answer to these questions or to the \"n1eaning of life': People's thoughts and per­ceptions have become too sophisticated, the relationships in which they think and act too complicated, to conform without resistance to the seemingly simple explanations of the past. With this, we have no intentions of putting down the wisdoms of the past. On the contrary, if we look at these wisdoms a bit closer and more undogmatically, we just might realize that they,re not that simple after all, but it was actually their unreflected and even silly interpretation that distorted our view of true versatility and flexibility for quite a long ti me. The heritage of the Renaissance and the Enlightenment didn,t make a real in1pact on magic until late in our modern times, but that impact is the individual is ruthlessly placed in the center of one's own universe so that one fi nally learns to assume responsibility for his or her own life and image of reality instead of hanging on the skirts of some fa ther or mother god, \"divine\" commandments, imposed n1orals and ethics, church, or community only striving to become a perfectly functioning agent or slave to someone else's will in the hopes of getting a nice spot in the sun in the afterlife, of being forgiven of all sins, of \"positive karma,\" or of social recognition that have been Practical Sigil Magic (II) 165"},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"luring «humanity,, fo r thousands of years like carrots dangling in front of a donkey's nose so that it parries and tirelessly continues to plod into dead ends.

A magician,s vulnerability can be as individual as one's goals in life. This is why we can,t possibly list aU the stumbling blocks here; we can only list a few of the most common ones and give you tips on how to deal with them constructively. We'd like to take a closer look at one of these stumbling blocks: habit. The Power of Habit Sometin1es we fo rget that everyday sayings and quotations can often be an informative lesson in the way of perceiving things. A phrase like \"the power of habit', that we use daily yes, almost habitually without even thinking of its true meaning should actu­ally make us suspicious. In fa ct, habit generally has such a great deal of power over us that (a) it can become a serious obstacle in modern magic when working with the im­portant technique of paradigm shifting, but also (b) it can be util ized fo r intentionally acquiring new habits that can benefit our magic. That's why ifs also necessary to get an exact picture of our own habits and study them as thoroughly as possible until we find their source. None of this is half as easy as it sounds. The majority of our habits are anchored in our subconscious and therefore quite difficult to track down. We,re often surprised when friends or acquaintances point out habits we never even knew we had. It's even more difficult to find out the cause of such habits since they're usually quite complex and can,t be put into exact words at best we might have a hunch about their origin. Thafs why we should start with habits that are more obvious, such as smoking, or needing that morning cup of coffee, or hav­ing to watch the news or sports every day, and so on. When searching fo r the causes, don,t be satisfied with superficial explanations such as \"I smoke because I like smoking.,, Maybe you like eating ice cream, too, but you,d never devour twenty to sixty ice cream bars a day fo r years on end or get all jittery when you don,t have any in the house, unless 166 Practical Sigil Magic (II) •"},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"you're really addicted! The line separating habit and addiction is often very fine, and one of the main characteristics of an addiction is the stubborn denial that it exists. If you've been convincing yourself fo r years that you \"can quit anytime, if you set your mind to it, prove it by quitting, fo r example, fo r six months or even two years or even just a week, or smoking twenty cigarettes one day and just three the next, ten the next, one the next, and so on, until your smoking has become completely unpredictable. You can even use a die as a magical means of deciding how many to smoke that day. We don,t intend to encourage smoking in any way, nor do we want to condemn it­each person needs to decide fo r oneself if he or she's willing to accept the health risk in­volved or not. In any case, those old books about magic are full of nonsense when they claim that a magician absolutely should not smoke, drink alcohol, or eat meat and must remain sexually abstinent. The insignificance of such strict demands is pretty clear when we keep in mind that someone like Franz Bardon prohibited his as piring initiates from smoking, but was a chain smoker himselfl Smoking is a good example though because it's widespread and gives us the oppor­tunity to deal with it quite intensely as a habit and/or addiction. If you're a nonsmoker, try the same with an eating or drinking habit, sexual habit, or something similar. In the practical exercises section, you'll find more helpful hints on how to work with this theme. From the above, ifs also clear that the magician needs to put aside magic from time to time so one doesn't become addicted to the habit and turn into its slave instead of its master.

This holds true for words in general. Try mumbling the word \"cheesecake\" for a half hour straight, and it won't take long before you don't even realize what you're saying anymore you'll have to consciously focus on reactivating this information. 3. To clarify things, we'd like to point out that the term uformwa•> is used in magic similar to the way ifs used in mathematics or chemistry. The dictionary defines \"formula,, as ua series of letters, numbers, or words used to concisely describe a situation.H Applied to magic, there,s another definition: 'cA short sen-Practical Sigil Magic (II) 167"},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"tence or expression used to clarify a thought., Actually, magical formulas are often a combination of the two.

The word \"correspondence, also means \"allocation, or \"conformity,\" but we'U stick to \"correspondences, since this is the term most commonly used in magical literature. Instead of''correspondenccs, we could aJso say ((analogies,\" which has been quite a pop-• ular word in n1ore recent times. The latter basically means the same but gives it a slightly diffe rent slant.• \"Analogy, means ((similarity,'' but not necessarily equality or identity. With the help of correspondences, the magician structures his universe in such a way that helps him develop possible microcosmic solutions to macrocosmic problems a process that will become clearer to you with practice. This is a reference to the so-called law of analogies, according to which similar or corresponding things exist in a subtle re­lationship of cause and effect. Particularly in dogmatic magic, these correspondences have been used and abused, fo r example when they were understood as <'objective, and therefore incontestable. A dogmatic magician, fo r example, would try to convince you that the metal lead only be­longs to the planetary principle of Saturn and in no way to Venus or the moon. He 169 '"},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"would argue that if you would perform a moon ritual and use the n1etallead, the oper-• ation would be destined to fa il from the start. ln this way he thinks similar to a chemist conducting a laboratory experiment his in1age of the world prevents him from ran­domly substituting sodium with potassium or helium if a specific result is expected. Ramsey Dukes used a different example of a chemist looking at a little pile of table salt (sodium chloride); the chemist shook his head in disbelief and mun1bJed, uNo one can tell me that there,s chlorine in this stuff!,, Dukes explains that it would be wrong to be­lieve that the metal lead would in any way '<contain,, Saturn in the same way that sodium chloride contains chlorine. Especially in such a scientific world like ours is today, it's of great importance that the magician not succumb to the temptation of mixing up the reference planes and cor­respondences by equating similarity with identity. This is not only unscientific thinking, but it also creates unnecessary problems that could stunt our magical growth by years and even decades, because, among other things, this disguises the subjective character of the correspondences. The practical use of correspondences results less from the structure that they impose on the otherwise seemingly chaotic cosmos, but more from the wide variety of ways to apply them that they offer us. As Ramsey Dukes says in LIBER SSOTBME: In Ritual Magic, we learn to fo rm attributions both by meditating and observing, but instead of passively studying the state of affairs in order to prophesy as does the di­viner we deliberately set up an unnatural concentration of appropriate fa ctors in order to precipitate a desired event (a parallel with a laboratory experiment). Within certain (although strict) limits, the correspondences are principally random and arbitrary. Whether we allocate the metal lead (as in one of the n1any contradictory traditions)2 or iron to Saturn is of no significance as long as we remain consistent and don,t use lead once and iron the next time and then copper the next, because experience has shown that this w ill badly confuse the subconscious, which will lead to entirely un­predictable results. These limits shouldn't concern us right now since this would just in­crease the flood of information and possibly even distract you from your actual practice. More important, on the other hand, is the fa ct that the correspondences create an artifi­cial one-sidedness during magical rituals that's absolutely necessary for carrying out our operations. For example, if we wanted to work with the planetary principle of Jupiter, we 170 Planetary Magic (III)"},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"would banish everything from the temple that doesn't correspond to this planet or that may even negate or work against it. This is an act of symbolic concentration, which we can also observe in pathological fo rm in hysteria only that here it happens intentionally and in a controlled manner, which is why it leads to the desired success in the end. You should always keep in mind that the correspondences need to be experienced and lived through practice if they're to be of any value. Simply stated, regardless of whether you adopt the fixed correspondences sanctioned through tradition or create your own, you need to bring them to life through your own practice if they're meant to be more than just intellectual games. Once we've thoroughly spiritualized our system of correspondences, it has the ad­vantage of enabling fa st and flexible reactions. We don't need long to find the right tools and can act in1mediately since everything reflects a subjective meaning and can be put in relation to the whole without having to waste too much time on searching fo r re asons.3 I think Mace probably summarized the process of implementing correspondences most clearly: (( (T] he wizard distinguishes many different types of available power, dresses each with its own symbol and name, and then calls them up when he needs them through the means of meditation, chanting (mantra), dance, and even sexual activity.,, However, modern freestyle sorcerers don't attempt to structure the powers they work with into a universal, generally valid system. In fa ct, they generally don't use many tra­ditional symbols at all, but only those that are a product of their own subconscious mind. But this process is usually a long, thorny path that we,d like to shorten fo r you with our information in the next sections. In the next two charts, you'll find the most significant traditional correspondences of planetary magic that are especially relevant fo r ritual practice. For the n1ost part, they • were taken from the systems of the Golden Dawn and Aleister Crowley. After that, we'll be giving you more information on how to use these correspondences in practice by giv­ing and explaining a sample ritual outline. If you fe el it's important that your training should include these traditional elements as weU, then you should memorize these correspondences in the long run until they're stored deep inside and can be recalled automatically anytime.

That should be sufficient to get you fa miliar with the practical application of the hexagram ritual, which is quite appropriate since it's generally used as part of a larger ritual any­way. The only thing we,d like to explain before we start is why the sun principle shouldn't be dealt with until all of the other planets have been studied in-depth. Since the sun is not an ordinary planet, but rather the sum of all the others (although a size that's much larger than the sum of all its parts), thorough knowledge of its ('parts\" is required before dealing with the sun itself. This is why some older magic literature warns against prac­ticing sun magic. For example, until we've understood the principle of Saturn, we won't 174 Planetary Magic (III)"},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"be able to understand the old dictum \"the core of the sun is Saturnic,'' or understand why the nu mbers 3 (Saturn) and 6 (sun) are closely related (\"doubling, is not the an­swer).

The newcomer to magic with certain restrictions based on one's individual horo­scope will generally find it easier to understand planets such as Mercury or Jupiter at first instead of Mars or Saturn fo r example, which is why we'd like to start with these principles before getting to the more difficult, ''harder\" ones. The Ritual Outline Although there's plenty of room fo r spontaneity in modern magic, this requires thor­ough knowledge of the material you're working with only a magician who has truly mastered one,s trade could ever hope to improvise effectively in an emergency or when­ever one wants. AJthough I personally don't tend to be as overcautious as some magi­cians (predominately those from the old school) who prepare their rituals months or even years ahead of time with the fe ar that if the wrong correspondences are used, something might go wrong and the whole operation couJ.d be sabotaged. But of course there are no objections to you thoroughly studying your trade. But you should never let despair prevent you from taking practical action. The beginner in particular often has problems <<styling\" one,s own rituals properly. Since one of the immediate main goals of a magical ceremony is '<creating the right at­mosphere,, (which you should be well fa miliar with by now) or creating the proper am­bience to promote the gnosis thafs necessary fo r achieving your magical goal, you should take the same amount of care in planning a ritual as you would in planning a party (such as a housewarming party) fo r good friends. Admittedly, it's true that small accidents can tremendously liven up a party and unexpectedly create a very nice mood, and this appl ies to rituals as well. But since these happen often enough anyway unex­pectedly, there's no need to plan fo r them artificially. In the next chart, you,ll find a sample outline of a planetary magic hexagram ritual that builds on the basic ritual structure that we,ve already given; this basic structure (with slight variations) will fo rm the basis fo r most of our rituals fo r the time being.

One characteristic of rituals from the circular tradition is that they involve only a minimu1n amount of written preparation. The angular tradition, on the other hand, generally prefers much more elaborate rituals with a strict distribution of the various roles (usually three people are involved) that are planned right down to the smallest detail and include fixed ritual texts. Our rituals of the circular tradition, which will be the main fo cus of our interest fo r now, are designed fo r ((household use, and can be performed without a great deal of effort or requiring outrageous tools and the memorization of long texts. There,s a certain philosophy behind all of this. In contrast to the angular tradition thafs common to most magical orders where the magician is required to apply a maxi­mum amount of external effort from the elaborate temple equipment and parapher­nalia up to the sometimes extreme baroque-sounding ritual texts and an often auto­cratic master of ceremony and allowed to grow or even be fo rced '(en masse\" into a certain energy, the circular tradition concentrates on letting the magician fi nd and de­velop the appropriate energies inside oneself on one,s own.

Forgetful magicians, however, should remember to have a pen and paper ready on or next to the altar since you,ll often receive important information during a ritual that you,ll want to write down right away it's something like dream work, in which immediate recording is the only guarantee fo r making progress. The selection of specific equipment fo r the ritual depends on the magician's personal correspondences. That's why we'd like to point out once again that the chart shown is merely an example! The fa ctor \"lighting\" is often overlooked, although this is a good way to create the corresponding at mosphere (especially in the fo rm of colored candles or light bulbs). There may be some authors that reject any kind of electric lighting in the temple, but there are plenty of those who welcome it. In any case, modern lighting tech­niques can offer a number of possibilities to the experimental magician by creating the corresponding color effects that our ancestors surely would have envied the theatrical effect of having the temple flooded with orange (Mercury) or green (Venus) light shouldn,t be underestimated. Of course, there,s no limit to the number of correspondences that you can use in your temple, so lefs just look at a few of the more common examples taken from the traditional magical analogies. The first item listed under 2b is an eight -sided brass 180 Planetary Magic (Ill)"},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"plate here you see a combination of the correspondences \"8\" and \"brass,\" which is rel­atively common to practical magicaJ thinking. In the same way, for a Mars operation we could use a five-sided iron ring with an embedded ruby thafs decorated in blood with symbols. The correspondences used don't need to be unique, meaning that they can be used several times in the san1e operation. For example, we could aJso put another eight -sided brass plate on a yellow-or orange-colored headband, decorate our belt with eight orange­colored, eight -sided pieces of leather, and at1ach an agate stone to the brass buckle. This may seen1 too time-consuming, or even too theatrical or kitschy, but we should always keep in mind that the subconscious mind reacts quite positively in its \"childish\" way to sul\"h a flood of impulses. It's well-known that nothing is more effective in magic than ex­cess, or, as the saying goes, \"The more the merrier.\" In this sense, ifs impossible to overdo the correspondences, and any inteUectual-aesthetic considerations need to be put on the back burner. In fact, many aspects of magic may seem tasteless to the aesthetically sensitive layman, but the main thing we're talking about here is functionality just as in any other trade. If it's practiced consciously enough, it will develop a specific and autonomous aes­thetic of its own that the observer needs to grow into in the same way he or she grows in to the aesthetics of futurism or cubism. The correspondences fo r fragrances and incense often overlap since one often takes the place of the other. In general, though, ceremonial magic differentiates between fra­grances that are used as perfume or oill and those that can be burned as incense. Knowl­edge of how to use them often results from practice itself. Even though fresh roses can smell sweet and remind you of Venus, dried (or even fresh) rose petals stink horribly when burned, and even the most experienced magician would have trouble associating this stench with uvenus, and \"loveliness.\" And not every oil that sn1ells good on the skin will smeU good when it evaporates or is bu rned. And, to return to our example fo r Mer­cury, we definitely don't recommend trying to burn highly explosive ether but when it's sniffed in smaU doses (without getting high!) it will definitely let you experience the vivacity of Mercury (but be careful with open fire -ether is highly flammable, so don't leave the container open unnecessarily!). In a similar sense, applying sage oil to your skin surely won,t stimulate you inteUectually (unless it occurs to you how exotic magic can be ... )., but will more likely remind you of a hospital room but when this herb is dried and burned, it can surely have a cleansing, clearing effect. P�netary Magic (Ill) 181"},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"We,ve summarized the so-called sacraments in the category ((other, since not every ritual works with such offerings. Generally speaking, there are two ways of dealing with offerings (which applies to religion as well, by the way). The fo llowers of the first prefer to destroy the offering after the rite (which can be done by burning or burying it), while the fo l1owers of the second prefer to consume it. The latter tradition, which I belong to myself, can again be divided into two subgroups: (a) magicians/mystics who elevate the offering, fo r example in Christianity where bread is equated with the body of Christ, and (b) magicians/mystics who elevate themselves to equality with the gods, who have earned the offerings and therefore consume them. The n1ethod in b) sounds most logi­cal to me fo r invocations, but that doesn't necessarily mean that the other methods don,t have their advantages as well: In principle, it's just a question of belief and/or tempera­ment that each person has to answer for him-or herself. The theophagic (from the Greek theos, \"god,'' and phage in, ((to eat or devour,') or \"cannibalistic,, method has cer-tain advantages in a magical sense since it anchors the paradig1n of taking power fr om the outside ('<Spirit of God,', \"Mercy of the Highesf'), which has quite a significant psy­chological value. Of course, the winged sandals (which the magician most likely will have to make him-or herself) correspond to the typical fo rm of Mercury-Hermes in his function as a messenger of the gods. The correspondences of fish (the swiftness and n1obility of this aquatic animal) and white wine (the clarity and elated effect of this drink) are tradi­tional. The dictionary is a logical correspondence if you think about the function of Mercury as a communicator (he corresponds to the ancient Egyptian god Thot, the in .. ventor of the written alphabet). The less orthodox may think of correspondences like guncotton and rap music, but these are really just modern expansions of the traditional ones. Guncotton looks completely harmless and can be used like norn1al cotton fabric or absorbent cotton. But when it comes in contact with fire, it reveals its true (and quite dangerous) nature. Is there a better analogy fo r Mercury, who's also known as the god of thieves and rogues, tricksters and charlatans? Rap music, on the other hand, is charac­terized by the spoken word; lyrics and language are the main fo cus while the individual words are intertwined in clever symbiosis with the beats. This reflects the game Mercury likes to play with language, truth, and wit. An important aspect of being able to magicaUy work with correspondences is con­verting them into practical action. Experience has shown that this is especially effective 182 Planetary Magic (III)"},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":"when considered during the preparation of a magical operation. At first it may seem a bit ufake, if you start a philosophical dispute on command directly before a ritual ( espe­ciaiJy if it's with yourself!), but you'll quickly learn that such actions indeed contribute to (or even guarantee) the success of the operation. Creativity is not only desired, but is even an integral part of magic itself; onJy the consequent conversion of these correspon­dences into everyday actions and perceptions can bring them to life and enable them to share some of their power and energy with the magician. In categories 2 and 3, there,s plenty of room to add little reminders such as, in our example, the Hebrew ritual fo rmulas. (We've left out the fo rmula uArarita,\" assuming that you've memorized it by now si nce it's the same fo r all hexagrams.) You can also note the direction the lines of the pentagram or hexagram are drawn by making little sketches, and so on. For group work, it's important that each person knows their role in advance, which should also be noted in the ritual outline. (For example, you would write ((Frater X\" under 2 and ((Soror Y'' under 3, and so on.) As you can see in our outline, the hymn or invocation text doesn't necessarily need to fill several pages. Although we'll occasionally provide you with examples of such hymns, you should get used to writing your own right from the start! That may be pure hell for those magicians who have little or no talent fo r creative writing, but the poetic value of the text doesn't really matter. After all, there are no literary standards you need to conform to and there's no need fo r you to strive fo r a Nobel Prize in literature. Plus, your hymns can be even simpler than the one I suggested; often just simply repeating the name of the planet along with \"Come, come, come!'' is enough to get the desired ef­fe ct. In our example, you'll see that our hymn in Chart 17 mentions a whole bunch of correspondences (\"spirit of the intellect,n «playful fo ol of thieves,\" and so on). If you have difficulties wording your hymns poetically, then keep them short and concise and put all the more effort into assuring that your temple contains lots of correspondences. However, you should remember the function that a hymn has in a ritual in the first place: In a way it's like a '(telephone call, to finaUy establish contact with the desired en­ergy. (In German, invocations are literaUy called Anrufungen, <<calls.,') In psychological terms, a Mercury invocation gives the subconscious mind the message that it should now activate Mercury's energies. Thafs why we shouldn't leave out such texts, especially Planetary Magic (III) 183"},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":"in the first few years of our training, since they also represent articulations of our will (statements of intent). Later we'll be able to reduce the number of correspondences we use. By using such correspondences regularly, our subconscious will be conditioned until it automatically associates \"Mercury'' with the smell of styrax or the color orange. Once you've achieved this, you,U only need to use a fe w correspondences to arouse the desired energy. In any case, you should also study mythology parallel to working with planetary magic since it's usually pretty difficult to invoke a planetary god that you know nothing about. This is all a part of magical conditioning. In the Further Reading section, we'll recommend a few reference books on mythology that could be quite helpful when plan­ning your rituals. In the next section we'll be discussing the ritual function of incense in more detail. PRACTICAL EXERCISES • EXERCISE 19 APPLIED PARADIGM SHIFTING IN PRACTICE (111) These continue where Exercises 10 and 17 left off. Make a list of your habits, trying to think of as many as possible keep adding to this list every day for a week. You might try carrying a notebook with you at all times so that you can write down each habit immecliately as it occurs to you. You can even ask friends, acquaintances, partners, and rel­atives about your habits that they might have noticed often you,ll be sur­prised at the answers! After you've collected a fa irly comprehensive list, pick one habit from the list and give it up for a week and a half. Pick a habit that you have no emotional relation to, such as taking off your glasses whenever you speak, scratching the back of your head, or eating only certain kinds of fo od at breakfast, and so on. Every time you catch yourself submitting to your habit (usually \"com­pletely unconsciously and unintentionally,'' right?), you should give your­self a little reminder. Crowley required his students to cut their forearm 184 Planetary Magic (III)"},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":"with a razor blade for each transgression, which can be highly effective, but is something we definitely do not recommend for hygienic and health reasons. But the principle of <'pay with pain, is not necessarily all that wrong since we've acquired many of our habits through pain (physical or psychological) in the first place, for example during our childhood. The \"reminder)) about your habit should certainly be unpleasant enough to en­courage you to stick to your intention. However, with more and more practice you shouldn't have to rely on such tools. For the next week and a half, try to acquire a new habit that's just as meaningless to compensate for the loss of the old one. In this way, you'll recognize how much energy is actually ((eaten up\" by such habits. After a total of four weeks, start all over again with new habits. Do this for at least five months in order to really get the fe el for this exercise. In doing so, you'll learn how to free yourself from deep-seated habits by establishing and proving your independence from them when this is achieved, you can consciously choose or reject them at wilL The preliminary goal of this exercise is for you to be able to give up a habit that's very important to you (such as smoking, morning coffee, char­acteristic sexual habits, evening walk, and so on) for a longer period of time without you fe eling any longing for it or possibly even relapsing. In this sense, a helpful question might be, «How would someone be able to recognize me if I were to wear a disguise/completely disfigured/in­visible for example, if I were standing in complete darkness?, EXERCISE 20 PENDULUM TRAINING (11) Proceed with Exercise 16 for a while until you,rc pleased with your progress. That might even take months, so take your time and work thor .. oughly before moving on to this exercise. Get ten empty matchboxes and a piece of aluminum foil. Now hold the pendulum in the usual manner for a few minutes above the foil and Planetary Magic (III) 185"},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":"pay close attention to its movements; try· to keep your mind in a state of emptiness. You can even \"ask\" the fo il which pendulun1 movement it has. Now put the fo il inside one of the matchboxes and mix them up until you can no longer remember which box ifs in. Line up the matchboxes in a row so that you can comfortably hold the pendulum above each without moving them. Of course, you can move your chair if necessary. Try to de­termine which matchbox contains the fo il by using the pendulum as a guide. Instead of aluminum fo il, you can use any other object as long as it's smaU and light enough. Of course, you don't want to be able to recognize the object by its weight when you move around the matchboxes. If you don,t trust this method completely, or prefer to work with heav­ier objects, you can leave the room after first testing the pendulum,s reac­tion to the object and have a friend or partner hide it in one of the boxes fo r you. However, we recommend that the other person leaves the room before you start with your experiment so that he or she won,t infl uence you in any way, even if intentionally or unconsciously. If you get good results (a success rate of 80 percent or higher would be excellent), then double the number of matchboxes this increases your power of concentration while dowsing. Later you can also work with a combination of boxes and various different objects. Make a note of when your success rate is higher than usual.

EXERCISE 21 PRACTICE OF THE LESSER RITUAL OF THE HEXAGRAM (11) Perform at least two Mercury rituals by integrating the Lesser Ritual of the Hexagram as described in our example. Choose an object that corre-186 Planetary Magic (Ill)"},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"sponds to Mercury and charge it during every ritual with the energy of this planet by transferring it mentally through your hand. • This time, use the entire ritual structure given in Exercise 18 (including numbers 4 and 5). You,ll be charging the object a total of eight times, just so you,re men­tally prepared. Concerning the rest, just perform it according to the in­structions in Exercise 18. EXERCISE 22 THE lAO fORMULA IN PRACTICE (1) Perform the lAO fo rmula as described in this section immediately after showering or bathing while your body's still wet. Pay attention to your subtle perception, especially in your body. Where does the en­ergy flow with each vowe1? How do the three vowels differ in their effect? Following the exercise, try closing your eyes and fe eling the ball of energy with your hands. What do you fe el? Note aU of your impressions in your magical diary. After a while you can perform the lAO fo rmula anytime you fe el is appropriate, such as right after waking up or just before going to bed. It can also be used before and after the pentagram ritual, or before every magical ceremony.

EXCURSION: A MAGICIAN'S VULNERABILITY (II) Fear, A Dark Brother Of all the human emotions, fe ar is probably the most dangerous, unpredictable, and most difficult to control. Fear can bind people in chains, strangle them, steal their rea­sonability, their self-esteem and self-respect, cause panic and hysteria, eat away at their organism, penetrate their dreams like a thorn, destroy their will, make them fo rget all of their duties and rights, blur their perception, stupefy their spirit and it will constantly attack what it fe eds on, attracting the dreaded, and begging fo r deliverance through stu­pefaction, through salvation, or through the desperation of just wanting to finally put an end to it all. Out of fe ar a friend may betray a friend, a mother her daughter, a son his fa ­ther, a brother his sister; in war, fe ar is despised and may even be punished by death if the fe arful person is an endangerment to the situation. And yet fe ar is essential and may even be the most important of man)s primeval in­stincts. Fear keeps the human organism out of danger, helps it avoid situations where it might fa il and be injured, thereby ensuring the continuance of its species. Isn,t this sur­vival instinct just another expression fo r the fe ar of death, destruction, and extinction? Consequently, it's in no way desirable to eliminate fe ar entirely-w .. at least not until this instinct has learned to optimally perform its vital functions on another fe ar-free level without subjecting the organism as a whole to such tormenting fe ar to make it get out of the way of danger or render it harmless. But on the other hand, we owe thanks to the fe ar of freezing for architecture, the fe ar of starvation fo r fa rming and agriculture, and the process of fo od conservation and long-term food storage, and so on. To become a fe ar-free person who no longer needs this alarm mechanism often in­volves long, hard work that could take decades or even an entire life time, without any guarantee of success. The magician is impatient and doesn't want to waste any valuable time (a lifetime is always way too short fo r magic!) waiting fo r this goal to be achieved. Thafs why the magician takes a pragmatic approach and utilizes fe ar where one can, in order to gain control of it little by little, so that one's fi nally able to decide freely which Mantra Meditation (I I) 193"},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"fe ars one wants to keep (for whatever reasons) and which ones to eliminate or convert into valuable energy. For some magical operations, fear is simply indispensable, e.g., during demon evocations and sometimes when working with the so-calJed ((Holy Guardian Angel., Therefore we should learn to respect fear without letting it control every aspect of our being. If fe ar already has control, we need to shake it off and put it back on its right course. Of course, this is much easier said than done. But the serious magician will en­counter more than enough opportunities to turn the lead of fe ar into the gold of brav­ery and courage, of independence and fe arlessness, and of security and composure that spring from the true love of one's self, the recognition of one's true will, and the accep­tance of one's own power and might. Literally speaking, magic really has to do with growing up, and the final exam is fear itself and the way that one deals with it. Unfortunately, there's no recipe that tells you how to do this. Usually we just work with old, time-tested methods that are often quite primitive, such as building up a coun­terbalance to fe ar by consciously experiencing things that make us afraid. For example, whoever has a fe ar of heights should slowly get accustomed to mountain climbing and riding elevators, and whoever is afraid of roller coasters should buy a pack of tickets and stick it out until one,s fe ar is gone once and for all. This is a bit more difficult with psy­chological fears such as jealousy, fe ar of fa ilure, or angst. The only thing that helps here is plenty of meditation and insight in combination with the specific and systematic building up of your self-confidence. After all, most fe ars are based on a lack of self-es­teem, and once this is reestablished, the fe ars usually just disappear. Frequent meditation on death in connection with Saturn rituals and occasionally even experiencing a mysti­cal or shamanistic death can lead to a healthier attitude toward the subject and relativize the fears and worries of everyday life. Some fears are hidden deep down inside and are not all that easy to track down. Usu­ally they betray themselves through unexplainable aversions and preferences, through dreams, or through '<Freudian slips', that happen when you're directly and unexpectedly confronted with fear-causing things, people, or situations. Often only an experienced psychologist (meaning someone who understands human nature) is able to call these fears by their name. 194 Mantra Meditation (II)"},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"Always watch fo r any fe ars that you may not have been aware of before, and expand on the knowledge you've gained in Exercise 1 by making a complete list of your present fears. Continue to add to this list whenever necessary and cross out the items once you,ve overcome them! Always keep in mind that in magic, any fe ar you might have will attract it all the more. We can observe this especially weU in our behavior with anin1als. If you let a strange dog know that you're afraid of it, you arouse its hunting instinct and it may even attack you. But if you fa ce him with intrepid fe arlessness, it will n1ost likely succumb to your will or at least leave you alone. Of course, you shouJdn't overdo this work with your fe ars, but on the other hand it's usually fe ar that torments people the most and prevents then1 from reaching their goal of self-determination. The important thing here is to determine whether or not your fe ar is specific or general, and Jearn how to deal with the two types. In this sense, being afraid of riding an elevator is a concrete fe ar that can be eliminated with the help of an elevator. Angst, on the other hand, as we already mentioned, cannot be combated with such little things; it needs to be approached more thoroughly and offset with experiences of success, safety, and security until it loses its power (e.g., by building self-confidence). LEARNING THE CORRESPONDENCES (11) Maybe you've already asked yourself in the last section what we mean by such vague cor­respondences as \"all glorious odours'' and ((all evil odours.'' We purposely didn't go into detail at the time, hoping that it would encourage you to think about these things on your own. The beginner to magic usually prefers precise instructions, even concerning the exact • amount and use. This is both a product of our inner insecurity and of the search fo r ((objective,, or at least tangible guidelines. Actually, such ((unclear, descriptions as the ones above are usually much more useful than a specific list of herbs, ointments and oils. Categories, such as \"all sweet scents, (Crowley), leave the final decision up to the magician him-or herself and support the fa ct that correspondences are always nothing more than «subjunctive,', so that every magician is compelled to develop one's own per­sonal system of correspondences as he or she progresses. Mantra Meditation (II) 195"},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"Our symbol-logical fuzzy relation can be applied analogously here as well. Too much precision would place more importance on the intellect and its characteristics of struc­ture, categorization, and analyt ical thought, which would distract the intuition and emotion from its actual task with a flood of unnecessary, individual fa cts. Once again, the \"science\" of magic needs to step down and give the \"art'' of it the upper hand if it wants to achieve any kind of success. In this sense, please go back to the first section and reread our con1ments on this. You,ll find n1ore information on this subject further along where we,ll be discussing the function of incense in magic. MAGIC AS A REALITY DANCE In an article, English magician Ramsey Dukes touched on the problem of magic and the assertion of re ality. People had asked him again and again \"How come we Europeans with our overwheln1ingly unmagical and ra tional view of the world and technology have been able to suppress fo r centuries the shamanic native peoples who supposedly have so much magical power?, Dukes' answer was unexpected yet extraordinarily in­sightful: ((Because we're the better magicians.,, He explained further that magic princi­pally means establishing a certain intentional reality and asserting it despite any possible resistance from the outside world. This is exactly what the European magician did, and in the meantime even the most remote shamans of the Amazon or the mountains of Nepal have accepted these values and try to live accordingly, fo r example by striving to possess technical devices such as radios, digital clocks, or guns. If we think about this more carefully and what it has to do with our practice, namely that magic is actually \"the production of reality,\" many things will now become clear that were previously much too indirect and complicated to explain using other models of thought. On the one hand, we can draw the conclusion that the selection of magical tools we work with is basically endless since magic includes everything that serves the purpose of creating reality from the most insignificant everyday gesture right down to the most elaborate ceremonial spell. On the other hand, the meaning of the phrase ''Magic is always the perception of magic,, will also become clearer.

And in the end, we finally realize that we,ve always actively used magic to assert ourselves in life without consciously calling it that or recognizing it as such. Such considerations inevitably lead to the question of what reality actually is a question that both religion and philosophy as well as science and psychology have strug· gled to answer for thousands of years. For obvious reasons, we cannot provide a general answer to that just like the other systems cannot, but we'd like to point out that reality to a magician is not a rigid, inflexible constant, but more of a greatness that's constantly flowing and can never be clearly defined. Yes, it even goes so far to say that there are in­numerable realities and that his or her main task as a magician is to take part in as many of these as possible in order to ensure one's own versatility and flexibility, therefore con­sequently and logically expanding one's own spectrum of action.

It represents the magician,s will and it is used fo r all important magical operations, from casting the circle to charging talismans and amulets, as well as in magical warfare and in the dissolving and binding of relation­ships. The dagger is used to banish and protect, and many magicians view it as their only weapon that's never allowed to be touched by anyone else. It might be difficult fo r the beginner to understand how such a magical weapon can develop a life of its own, but here,s an example about my own magical dagger. It's a let­ter opener of Mauritanian origin made out of silver that I fo und in Senegal. I had al­ready been using it fo r quite some time when a person I knew stole it from me during a dispute we had. Without taking any magical action against the person, I just waited and swore that I would only use astral weapons from then on. After a few days of practice, I was able to do this satisfactorily and from then on I used them daily. Then about a week later, the aforementioned person gave me the dagger back voluntarily. The soft silver blade was bent and stained with blood: the result of a fa iled suicide attempt. I carefully took the weapon, bent the blade back into shape, wrapped it in silk, and put it in a safe place and continued to work fo r a long time only with astral weapons. Later, my careful 199"},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":"actions paid off. As the dispute escalated into an all-out magical war, I could easily de­fe nd myself against my opponent and prevent or repel any further magical or physical at­tacks since I possessed some of his blood and was able to work with his photograph; con­stant fa ilure, setbacks of both a physical and psychological nature, and magical backfiring (attacks that are not ignited properly and therefore ricochet back to the originator him­self) caused him to finally give up his hopes of ever wanting to destroy me. In doing so, I no longer worked astraUy, but rather I used the physical dagger along with the mumia (a vital fo rce tied to bodily secretions or the secretions themselves) of my opponent. The legend that circulates among my colleagues that I possess a dagger that ((keeps coming back\" is a bit exaggerated, but ifs a fa ct that weapons of this kind often develop an individual personality and behave in ways that are completely unpredictable, and not just on a material level. Thafs all the more reason fo r a magician to handle them with care and protect them from the hands of the unauthorized not because the weapons could lose power, which shouldn,t really happen if they,re charged properly, but rather due to the unforeseeable effects they might have on these people. For this reason, every experienced magician should ensure that their weapons are dealt with properly after their death. The dagger, along with the pentacle or lamen (which we,U be discussing later), is the magician's most individualistic weapon and is a symbol of his or her magical will. Con­sequently, its shape and the material it's made of can be anything you like and the illus­tration here merely shows one of many possibilities. We'd like to mention that some magical traditions prefer the sword instead of the dagger fo r banishing and the charging of objects, while others view the magic sword as a weapon that should only be used in a dire emergency and is therefore rarely used. If the characteristic of '<male/female, is considered, the dagger would represent the male principle, while the chalice, used fo r example in the Wiccan tradition, would rep­resent the fe male; in the Hermetic tradition, the male principle is often represented by the wand with its phaJHc shape. When choosing the proper weapon to use as a dagger or when making one yourself, make sure that it's easy to grip and lies firmly in your hand. The blade should be sharp and pointed, yet sturdy, firm, and free of any nicks. On the other hand, as in my case, it's possible that the right weapon just might find you (or that it \"comes to life\" fo r you) 200 Introduction to Ritual Magic (V)"},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"under unusual circumstances, although this may not be the ideal weapon as fa r as its physical characteristics are considered, you'll know if it's just right fo r you. In this case, always listen to your intuition and never fo rce yourself to use a weapon that you don't really like. This applies to weapons that ((speak,, as weU, such as a dagger that the magi­cian may cut oneself on the first time he or she touches it, drawing blood, and so on. By the way, the things we say here about the dagger apply analogously to all magical weapons as well. In some traditions of We stern magic that are still popular today, the dagger is given less significance than in others. Crowley views it merely as a symbol of alchemistic mer­cury (whereby the scourge and chain respectively stand fo r sulfur and salt), but he pre­scribes that the blade be plated with gold and the handle be made or plated with this metal as well. THE FUNCTION OF INCENSE IN RITUAL MAGIC From the viewpoint of developmentaJ history, our sense of smeU is the oldest of all the human senses and is directly connected to the human brainstcm. for this reason it tends to fu nction on a subconscious level, which is why some scientists even claim that it's im­possible to control it or to intentionally induce olfactory hallucinations. Magicians find this quite humorous, of course, since they,re well familiar with systematically training their sense of smell to bring about such ((hallucinations, in the first place. However, it's correct that most people have trouble co ntrolling this sensory organ without the proper • • tra1n1ng. In ceremonial magic, scents and smells play a vital role and that's always been the case. Shamanistic cultures are fa miliar with the use of oils and incense as well, and even back in the ancient days there was actually an industry that specialized in manufactur­ing such sacral incense mixtures fo r use in private and communal ritual ceremonies. There's no Indian temple, no Buddhist pagoda, and no Shinto shrine that doesn't use joss sticks; the offering of incense may be one of the oldest human practices of all times. In this sense, it's certainly not true (as some literature claims) that Western magic <'borrowed,, the ritual use of incense and similar practices from the Catholic Church­in fa ct, the church itself actually \"borrowed, this practice fro m ancient pre-Christian traditions. Introduction to Ritual Magic (V) 201"},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"The use of incense has two main functions. It serves the purpose of cleansing on a physical and subtle level, and induces a certain state of mind that we caU magical trance or gnosis. Since the memory of scents is often stored deep in the unconscious mind, this offe rs us the perfect opportunity to condition the psyche. For example, if we always burn the same incense (at least ten or twenty times) for every Mars ritual, the Mars trance will be much deeper than without such aids so that, finally, simply burning the Mars incense will be enough to induce the desired Mars gnosis. It may disappoint you even more that magical authors can almost never agree on which scents correspond to which principles (or planets, in this case). In order to give you just one example of the numerous contradictory statements that are out there, we'd like to take a look at the incense correspondents fo r the planet Jupiter as given by fo ur different authors of magical literature in the German and English languages:• • A Ieister Crowley: saffron; all generous scents. • Franz Bardon: saffron alone or mixed with linseed, orrisroot, peony blossoms, betony leaves, birch leaves. • Karl Spiesberger: saffron, ash seed, aloeswood, styrax, benzoin, lapis lazuli, mirror, peacock fe ather. • James Sturzaker: ox-tongue, apple tree, ash, barley, red beech, carnation, maize, dandelion, lo1ium, cornus, elecampane, white fig, hazelnut, henbane, holly, horse chestnut, jasmine, nutmeg, oak, olive tree, peach tree, plum tree, poplar, grape, rhubarb, sage, wheat, agrimony, lavender. We'll notice that at least saffron was mentioned by aH three authors, although this isn,t always true unless one author copies fr om another (which is often the case in occult lit­erature), even if one's role model doesn't stick to the \"traditionaf' correspondences. The word \"traditionar, is here in quotation marks because there really is no such thing when it comes to incense, although correspondences have often overlapped throughout magic,s history. We can therefore conclude that there is no objective list of correspondences in this field and that traditional authors often contradict each other considerably and in our practice, we have to pay the consequences of this, meaning that every magician needs to find one,s own correspondences as fa r as incense goes.

That's why ifs fine at first to buy prepackaged incense in the store that's usually mixed according to the instructions of certain authors or by other magi­cians who have the necessary experience. Prepackaged incense certainly has its disadvantages as well. On the one hand, the magician creates a dependence on the suppliers and manufacturers, which could be .. come a problem if one of these companies goes out of business or removes the product from its catalog. This is fa irly common on the small (or even tiny) market fo r magical equipment. And once you're conditioned to a certain scent, it often requires a lot of hard work to get the same results with a new one. Plus, the passive act of buying a magical tool can lead to general passivity in other areas of magic. last, but not least, good in­cense is not cheap. On the other hand, if you decide to make your own incense you,ll soon discover that this is no easy task and that it requires a fine touch and a good nose as weB as patience and hard work. That's why some magicians prefer to work with as few ingredients as possible, and only with those that are easy to obtain. You can get such ingredients in a magic shop, pharmacy, or a store that sells church supplies. This applies in particular to resins. Herbs can be fo und in the same way; in fa ct, there are plenty of herbal and health fo od stores that sell quite a wide variety. Some of the more traditional ingredients used in ancient times particularly in the Middle East include the fo llowing: Styrax (or storax, liquid amber, benzoin) This liquid balsam fr om the amber tree is often added to mixtures to make the smoke thicker. In liquid fo rm, ifs quite sticky and is therefore also used to bind dryer resins to­gether, for example larger pieces of frankincense (see below). Often styrax is meant when the term \"amber, is used (see \"amber, below). Galbanum (or mother resin) A gum resin made of greenish-blue grains that plays an important role in the incense mixtures used in the Hermetic, angular tradition. Introduction to Ritual Magic (V) 203"},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"Olibanum (also frankincense) After hardening, this milky juice fr om the North African Boswellia tree (Boswellia ser­rata), whose name was derived by distorting the Hebrew word lebonah or \"milk,'' turns into yellowish or brownish translucent tears. Myrrh One of the most commonly used gum resins, which consists of brittle, brownish tears. As a tincture, myrrh is also used in naturopathy. Benzoin (or sweet asant, asa dulcis) This resin of the benzoin tree is easily available everywhere and is used to season incense mixtures. Asant (or asafoetida, devil's dung) This gum resin was frequently used in the Middle Ages as a substitute fo r garlic and was an essential ingredient in every cake( !). Today it's almost solely used in veterinary med­icine, which is why ifs usually only obtainable in a very dirty state and therefore needs to be cleaned before use. When burned, asant causes thick clouds of penetrating smoke that stinks, similar to the stench of burning rubber or garlic, and ifs mainly used fo r de­monic operations or occasionally fo r exorcisms. Ambra (or gray amber , ambergris) A secretion from a sick sperm whale that's generally caught on the su rface of the sea after storms. It's extremely rare and expensive, therefore not easy to obtain. Some au .. thors understand ambra to include other pleasant-smelling substances as well, usually styrax (see \"styrax, above). Bernstein is sometimes called ''yellow amber', and may be used in incense mixtures as weU as in ground fo rm. Balsam This is a general term fo r pleasant-smelling, syrupy resins. Mecca balsam (or balm of Gilead, Opobalsum verum), fo r example, is the resin of the plant Somiphora opobalsa­mum, while sweet Peru baJsam is made from the resin of the To luife ra pereirae tree and 204 Introduction to Ritual Magic (V)"},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"is also caUed \"black Indian balsam., Tolu balsam (or opobalsam) is the resin of the To luife ra balsamum tree. Ancient recipes fo r incense mixt ures are often cause fo r confusion. Sometimes ingredi­ents are confused, such as benzoin and benzoe, ambra and amber, and the various bal­sams, since they're translated from a number of languages and retranslated, and inaccu ­rately written down and combined by those not having any great knowledge of the art. For example, one very old recipe fo r kyphi (Egyptian sun incense) is fo und in the Ebers papyrus. It reads: Dried myrrh, juniper berries, frankincense, cypress grass, mastic twigs, buckhorn, myrtle from northern Syria, raisins, styrax juice grind together and fo rm a substance. According to the recipe, women should add honey to it and cook everything together. In Exodus 30:34, 36, you,ll find instructions fo r an incense mixture as well that was revealed to Moses by Yahweh: And the LORD said unto Moses: take unto thee sweet spices: stacte, onycha, sweet gal­banum and pure fra nkincense, of each like much: and make cense of them com­pounded after the craft of the apothecary, mingled together, that it may be made pure and holy. And beat it to powder[ ... ] let it be unto you holy. But he also warned Moses in Exodus 30:37-38 to not misuse and thereby desecrate this mixture thafs reserved only fo r mass. And see that ye make none after the making of that, but let it be unto you holy fo r the LORD. And whosoever shall make like unto that, to smell thereto, shall perish fr om among his people. Yahweh also gave instructions on how to make an anointing oil fo r consecrating the altar and the tabernacle, and fo r ordaining priests: Take unto thee sweet spices: of pure myrrh five hundred sickles2, of sweet cinnamon half so much, two hundred a·nd fifty sickles: of sweet calamite, two hundred and fifty. Of cassia, two hundred and fifty after the holy sickle, and of oil olive an hin. And make of them holy anointing oil even an oil compound after the craft of the apothecary (Ex­odus 30:23-25 ).

Instead of resins, herbs (usually dried) are frequently used as incense as well and can be used alone or in mixtures. Shamans often use tobacco smoke fo r healing operations while some North American Indians prefer sage, which has become an established prac­tice in shamanic groups in Europe as well. In demonology or evocation, the goal is to conjure a spirit to ((the consistency of thick vapors'> (in Crowley's words) and make it materialize. This is sometimes taken lit­erally. An incense burner is placed inside the evocational triangle and the demon is sum­moned to materialize in the column of smoke. Just a few hundred years ago, it was com­mon practice to simplify this operation by using a prepared altar that was designed with a clever system of mirrors to project images on to the smoke as a sort of old-time ((slide show.,, Surely this was seldom used as a means of intentional deceit, but the value of this practice as an imagination aid is still appreciated today. l fs much easier to bring an image to life that already exists and can actually be seen moving on a flickering, rotating, and writhing column of smoke (projection)> than to just wait until the right image ma­terializes on its own (the so-called \"eidetic, or crystal ball technique)4 We should also mention that modern research has shown that the burning of certain incense (especially olibanum) causes the fo rmation of so-called tetrahydrocannabinols or \"hashish substances.\" In other words, incense makes you \"high'' in a sense, which def­initely corresponds at least in part with our intention of inducing magical trance. Some ministers were even known to have an \"addiction to incense,,, which resulted mainly from the chewing of incense, not just the inhaling of it. In addition, incense has a num­ber of specific hygienic functions since it disinfects and keeps away bugs. For your own practice, it would be advisable fo r you to first get accustomed to the el­emental and planetary powers through ritual by either not using any incense at all, or by using a premixed, store-bought one. Once the magician has gotten acquainted with all of the planets, he or she should work with each one individually as the main fo cus until its correspondences are completely clear to him or her. Then one should make one,s own personal incense mixture. You can see that this process can easily take years because after aU, how many magicians can truly say that they understand and are fa miliar with all of the correspondences of a certain energy! In the end, the problem is purely theoret-206 Introduction to Ritual Magic (V)"},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"ical as long as you always have enough of some kind of incense on hand that clearly con­tributes to the atmosphere of the ritual. While in earlier times the incense was thrown into the sacrificial fire, today the pref­erence is to smolder or vaporize it in an incense burner instead of burning it directly. This practice releases the aroma substances more gently and effectively. Most modern magicians use impregnated, self-igniting charcoal tablets that have a hollow on one side to hold the incense. For vaporizing liquid incense and oils, you can place them on a piece of metal (made of copper, fo r example) that rests on a tripod and light a candle underneath. The Incense Burner The incense burner is one of the most frequently used tools in ceremonial magic. In order to be able to read other literature on magic, it's important to know that the in­cense burner may also be called a ((thurible, or a \"censer.,, Crowley distinguishes between the two in his book Magick and uses two different burners at the same time. Often the incense burner will consist of some kind of a bowl on a tripod. Kabbalisti­cally and biblically oriented magicians prefer burners made of brass. The act of burning incense is filled with much syn1bolism, so we'd like to quote Crowley on this matter: Into the Magick Fire all things are cast. It symbolizes the final burning up of all things in shivadarshana. It is the absolute destruction alike of the Magician and the Un iverse (Magick, p. 113 ). It's the magician,s will that ignites this consuming fire that destroys the old to make room fo r the new, and the censer is the container (or universe) in which this act of hor­rible destruction (e.g., undesired influences and distracting thoughts) takes place. But Crowley also warns against overestimating that which you might see: In this smoke illusions arise. We sought the light, and behold the Te mple is darkened! In the darkness this smoke seems to take strange shapes, and we may hear the crying of beasts. The thicker the snzoke, the darker grows the Universe. We gasp and tremble, beholding what fo ul and unsubstantial things we have evoked! Introduction to Ritual Magic (V) 207"},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"Ye t we cannot do without the Incense! Unless our aspiration took fo rm it co uld not influence fo rm. This also is the mystery of incarnation (ibid., pp. 1 13-14 ). Later on, he continues: All these phantoms, of whatever nature, must be evoked, examined, and mastered; otherwise we may find that just when we want it there is some idea with which we have never dealt; and perhaps that idea, springing on us by surprise, and as it were from behind, may strangle us. Th is is the legend of the sorcerer strangled by the Devil! (ibid., p. 116 ). However, the old master of modern-day magic doesn't just mean the apparitions that we can visibly see in the clouds of smoke, but also our moral and religious concepts and ideas, as well as every single thought itself that's not analyzed and therefore kept at a dis­tance so as not to identify ourselves with it, fo rcing us into the abyss of illusion. Crowley gives a recipe of his own fo r incense: 1 part olibanum (the sacrifice of the human will of the heart, or his profane wanting), Y. part styrax (the earthly desires, dark, sweet, and clinging) and X part aloe (lignum aloes, which symbolizes Sagittarius, the arrow, and therefore the magical aspiration itself). For Crowley (who is actually talking about the metaphysical significance of burning incense and the materials used, and not really about the censer itself quoted here), smoke also represents the astral plane, which surely needs no fu rther explanation if you remember our statements about dem.on evocations. Hanging incense burners are popular as well, especially fo r group rituals and when working in large rooms, and they can also be used to redraw the lines of the magical cir­cle after it has been cast. This fo rms a column of smoke that provides the magician with additional protection; this column also resembles a veil that hides the magical operation from profane eyes and symbolizes the impenetrability of a good magician. Of course, we shouldn,t need to mention that the incense burner must be made of fireproof material. Although frequently, literature does fa il to mention the need fo r suf­ficient ventilation to prevent the charcoal and incense from being suffocated. This of course doesn't pose a problem when an open burner is used, but sometimes a covered censer is preferred since it controls flying sparks and allows the oils and essences to va-208 Introduction to Ritual Magic (V)"},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"porize underneath the lid. A covered burner should always have enough holes fo r venti­lation in order to ensure optimal smoke development. One variety of the burner is the smoke pan, which some magicians prefer. The pan is usuaUy made of copper, sturdy brass (if brass is too th in, as in most cheap flowerpots, it will crack when heated), or even iron. It rarely has a cover. Due to its easy-to-grip han­dle, ifs especially suited fo r initiations, fo r example when the candidate is fumigated with smoke in order to cleanse him or her with or connect him or her to the element of Air. PRACTICAL EXERCISES EXERCISE 23 ASTRAL MAGIC AND MEDITATION (I) Contrary to other authors, we won,t be starting our training of astral travel and astral magic by recommending that you learn to separate your astral from your physical body. Complete beginners with no previous ex­perience in astral travel usually find the fo Uowing technique much easier and are able to achieve equally good results in just a short period of time, which is why we,ll be discussing the actual astral trip at a later time. Our technique trains the mastery of asana and body control as well. Sit in an asana of your choice preferably the god posture, dragon posture, or half-lotus posture-each day fo r at least fifteen minutes fo r several weeks. Collect your thoughts and just observe your breathing. If any thoughts come to mind (and they surely will!), don,t try to fo rce them away since that will only make them more stubborn just let them pass without taking any notice of them. After awhile, let yourself and your body expand mentally with each breath. Do this little by little at first n1aybe just two or three inches and increase the distance each day you practice until you finally fill the entire room that you're meditating in (after about fo ur weeks). Finish your meditation by making yourself get smaller again each time you inhale. You can combine this exercise with the fo llowing one as well by first working with mantras until you reach a suf­ficient state of gnosis before beginning with the actual meditation.

EXERCISE 25 THE lAO FORMULA IN PRACTICE (11) You need a partner fo r this exercise. If the person's not a magician and you don't want him or her to find out about your magical activities, just say ifs a sound and energy exercise similar to those used in singing lessons or eu­tony training. Even the greatest doubter will soon realize how this exercise vitalizes one's whole body and stop asking questions. Face your partner. Stretch your arms out in front of you, palms vertical and fa cing inward near the neck area of your partner then vibrate the vowel I as powerfully as possible. Then hold your arms out straight in fr ont of you, palms horizontal with fingertips fa cing outward and direct them toward the chest of your partner whiJe vibrating t.he vowel A. Then spread your arms to fo rm a circle with your palms fa cing the hip region of your partner (as though you were to give a hip hug) and vibrate 0. You should never actua1ly touch your partner since this could hinder your concentration and the flow of energy. Now let your partner do the same to you. Repeat this exercise as often as you like, but listen to what your body says to prevent it from being over­charged this usually fe els like an extreme sensation of power. It's well suited fo r healing operations and in preparation fo r a ritual. Ifs important to make sure that the person doing the vibrating doesn,t transfer any of his or her own energy to the other person, but rather should stimulate his 210 Introduction to Ritual Magic (V)"},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"or her partner's own personal energy and cause it to start fl owing. Other­wise, the result would be a severe loss of energy. You can prevent ,this by • concentrating on the vibrating. EXERCISE 26 TRATAK The practice known to Indian yoga and tantra called tratak consists of concentrating on an external object to obtain a state of empty mind or gnosis. Choose an object that you have no emotional attachment to; it can be any everyday object such as a fo rk, a disposable lighter, or a shoestring. Sit in your asana and look at the object without thinking about anything. You'IJ notice that this exercise is quite different than Exercise 23 above. Don,t overdo it just three or fo ur times a week fo r ten minutes each is fine fo r the start. Don)t try to think about the object, just be aware of it while applying your 180° gaze as long as you can look at it without your eyes burning. Don't make any judgments about the object or this exercise whatsoever just write down any impressions in your magical diary after­ward. Practice this exercise fo r at least three months as described above, because practice makes perfect here as well. BIBLIOGRAPHY Aleister Crowley, Magick l.

The magical ritual demands only little fa ith but all the more skill; devotion to a deity is substituted by perseverance and persistence. This corresponds to the path that magic is taking today. If we take a look at its devel­opment over the last thirty years, we'll notice that it has been influenced by two qualita­tively new characteristics, namely the abandonment of dogma and the emphasis on magical dexterity. Both fa ctors naturally depend on one another and give the magical act an entire new quality, making it more effective as well. Sometimes traditionalistic magicians will complain that this approach is too \"unro­mantic'' and ((technocratic.\" This accusation is surely justified in a sense and should be taken seriously in more aspects than just this, although at the same time it points out a practical problem that magic geared toward success and efficiency is continually con­fronted with. It would be wrong to believe that this \"new objectivity\" and the related ex­posure of old occult bluffs (such as a secret cosmic master in the Himalayas, an astral leader of an order, and so on) could completely eliminate the basic interest of humanity 213"},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":"in the mystic and the numinous, or \"holy.\" Moreover, in a practical sense, it's question­able as to whether this would actually be desired in the first place. As we,U see again and again in conjunction with our practice of invocational magic, the temporary submission of a magician to some ((higher)) principle is often one of the basic requirements for mag­ical success .. Since the practice of magic always requires working with the unconscious mind, im­ages and especially myths play an important role as well. Surely modern magic in its need for iconoclasm and its rebellion against ancient, fossilized structures and dogmas has weU surpassed this goal. But that's exactly what revolutions and radical change do, like a cleansing thunderstorm. Let's take a closer look at exactly what happened in ord.er to get a better idea of how to evaluate the question of the supreme or divine in relation to magic. THE MAGICIAN AS A MYSTIC If we take a look at magical authors such as Levi, Papus, Guaita, Mathers, Waite, Crowley, Quintscher, Bardon, and Gregori us, and the history of magic from ancient times up to the modern-day present, mystical models have always predominated and the magical path has always been understood as the way to godhood regardless of how this is defined. Apart from a fe w early exceptions (by Crowley on occasion as well), it wasn't until the development of Pragmatic Magic and Chaos Magic that a departure fr om magical theism took place on a large scaJe, giving it mere philoso phical value instead. This is all the more amazing when we remember the significant role that early Buddhism (which was nontheistic as well) played in Eastern philosophy since the end of the classicism and romanticism periods. Philosophers such as Schopenhauer or Nietzsche cannot possibly be understood without this influence, just like Kierkegaard and the much later field of existential philosophy.1 The occult was influenced strongly by Buddhism as well, and even Crowley referred to himself as a Buddhist for quite some time, writing essays such as ((Science and Bud­dh.ism\" and radically rejecting any kind of theism while representing a rather skeptical yet rational outlook on things before he finally became a Thelemic mystic by accepting the Book of the Law as a revelation that can be applied to the entire world. Both Theoso-214 Mys ticism or Magic?"},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":"• phy and Anthroposophy, which were movements that had a significant influence on Eastern esotericism, spread Buddhist ideas (among others), although these were theisti­cally disguised and closer to mahayana Buddhism than anything else. ln any case, Western esotericism almost always worked with some kind of theism, which even included monotheism. In this we'll recognize the strong and seemingly in­vincible infl uence that Judaism and Christianity have on our culture. This is inseparable from the opinion that there are '(higher, and \"lower, or ((good, and ('bad'' spheres, and that religion is superior to magic in the end since it's supposedly more ''true.\" There,s no point in arguing about whether religion is the mother or daughter of magic since there are good viewpoints to support each side. Personally I tend to support the opinion that religion probably originated from magic, although the two certainly overlapped right from the start. But this is more of a factual consideration and there's no intention what­soever to place more importance on one or the other with postulated \"greater original­ity': In the end, it's all a matter of temperament anyway. Some people are more religious than others (probably the majority, in fa ct), and those who prefer the magical path gen­erally won't submit to any kind of god other than themselves fo r a longer period of time.2 But mysticism and religion are surely not the same; in fa ct, just the opposite is true. Although the mystic considers him- or herself to be a representative of\"true religion\" in the sense of religio, or reconnecting with the origin of things, this outlook usually strongly contradicts religious orthodoxy. In this sense, the mystic is considered a threat to religion's carefully protected hierarchy because he or she's not dependent on it to es­tablish communication with divine principles. Usually mystics are more or less ignored by Christian churches or, at best, just briefly mentioned without ever truly discussing their principles. Often the reason fo r all the skepticism surrounding mysticism is said to be the spiritual and mental health of the ''average person', who supposedly wouldn,t be able to deal with such concepts. Mysticism has sometimes even been condemned as being seriously dangerous, which is not surprising considering the fa ct that many mys­tics have entirely done away with any church dogmas, causing them to slip into the cat­egory of4'self-idolization,, due to its mystical union with the divine. (This still seems to be an aftereffect of the gnosis-shock caused by early Christianity.) Mysticism or Magic? 215"},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":"Nonetheless, mysticism and religion agree that there's some sort of divinity that hu­manity is subordinate to. For both, the goal of life is to make some kind of long .. term arrangement with this divinity in order to realize religio. Magic, on the other hand, is principally an ideological, neutral technique fo r influ­encing one,s fa te. Through its sociocultural and, of course, religious environment, it comes into contact with other systems and merges with them. This can be clearly seen in the development of Western magic, which was influenced at a very early stage aJmost ex­clusively by Jewish-Christian practices (with the exception of a fe w ancient pagan ele­ments during the Middle Ages). In search of a model to explain how magic works, the predominate religion of the times was a natural reference since it claimed to be able to explain everything anyway, and this harmonized well with ir>s job of salvation. This is certainly not a phenomenon specific to the West since the same procedure can also be observed, fo r example, in the Islam and Hindu cultural regions. On the other hand, due to its active role in dealing with fa te, magic paradoxically seems to be much closer to mysticism (which is generally described as being \"passive))) than to religion, which merely ((tolerates, and fo llows predetermined revelations and ((holy laws.'' And both rebel against external control by human authority figures: The mystic doesn't let him-or herself be prevented from accessing the origin of all things by clinging to some artificial system created by humans, and the magician isn,t content with simply being a pawn in a game and a victim of fa te, and therefore strives to master the powers that one sees con­trolling him-or herself and others. In this sense, it's of considerable importance in a structural sense that most mystics receive their visions and information passively and rarely strive fo r them, making their rebellion more of an unconscious act instead of an intentional one. But their hun1ble­ness toward the divine shouldn,t distract from the fa ct that it's basicaUy a Luciferian spirit that's at work here (which the reaction of orthodox religions clearly proves) that wants to reach the highest but without the structure that others ('(i gnorant people,, and therefore ((subordinates\") have built around it. From a practical point of view, both are also pragmatic while religion on the other hand is dogmatic since it's aln1ost aJways lacking the dimension of experience, and therefore it can usually only base its belief (of so mething not experienced firsthand) on the hearsay of others, which in turn needs to be interpreted by others (priests). 216 Mysticism or Magic?"},{"pageNumber":226,"pageContent":"Within Western magic, this development led to the adoption of monotheistic and mystic ideas that have hidden our view from their actual mechanisms for a very long time. Thus the magician is understood to be someone who will eventually have to give up magic in the end anyway. The separation between the so-called lower and higher magic that we often find in literature is merely an expression of such a fundamental viewpoint. \"Lower', magic is considered to be everything that has to do with matter, in­cluding aU types of practical magic for money, love, health, harm, and death and even the expression of one's own will in general. While matter is generally considered in­fe rior, being able to infl uence it is naturally a preliminary step that needs to be mastered and then eventually left behind. «High)) magic is more difficult to describe. Today we have two definitions: (a) the conventional description in which the magician eventually succeeds in establishing contact with transcendence, allowing oneself from then on to be guided by it (\"Not my will, but thy will be done, Lord.,', and so on), consequently be­coming a saint in a way; (b) the more modern version (although recognized in shaman· ism for thousands of years) that strives for independence from external means ('<empty hand techniques are the mark of an adepf' as Pete Carroll once wrote), or a direct form of magic for directly influencing fa te without needing elaborate symbolic equipment and external exercises, and not having to rely on external fa ctors. In the first definition, the magician is a theurgic mystic, while in the second he or she's a virtuoso technician who no longer needs any tools. Last but not least, magic is directly related to knowledge and realization as well as to personal development and truth. Within the religious-monotheistic paradigm, the path can only run linear with hierarchical steps reaching from bottom to top, whereby the top (e.g., the spirit) is considered more valuable than the bottom (e.g., the body). Here the magician is understood once again as a searcher of the truth, in contrast to a person who merely strives for personal freedom and independence. Due to the patriarchal structure of this paradigm, hardly anyone ever considers the possibility that these two goals do not necessarily need to contradict one another, since the truth has already been preformulated by the predominating monotheism and could therefore only mean the submiss.ion to only one god. What is often forgotten in this connection is the fa ct that the peak of this form of magic was certainly not in the Middle Ages, as often assumed, but rather during the Re­naissance or the preliminary phase of the Enlightenment. During this era, there was a Mysticism or Magic? 217"},{"pageNumber":227,"pageContent":"certain restlessness caused by the sudden questioning of the world's social and religious structures (and the first hidden form of atheism); the individual as such was rediscov­ered and, at the same time, there was great fe ar as to whether there would be eternal damnation as a result of such \"ungodly, sin. In this midst, a curious mixture of self-as­sertion and submission to religion developed in magic that still causes us a lot of headaches today. Even comparatively modern authors such as Douval are still stuck in this old paradigm of inner contradiction, e.g., when the magician is instructed to prac­tices of piousness and devoutness before performing an act of magic to harm someone, and even being told to call upon the powers of the Holy Trinity or the Son of God, Jesus Christ, and the heavenly hosts before performing an extremely unchristian act. Even the many words of warning and caution that these authors like to decorate their writing with can be explained by a bad conscience because they're really not magi­cians at all, but mystics fo r the most part (and frustrated ones at that) who can't afford to or won,t let themselves be freed from the shackles of orthodox religion and regard this as sober and structural as science does. Aleister Crowley was the only one to ever at­tempt to synthesize the «methods of science, the goal of religion,'' which corresponded to the broken perception of reality that was common to his era and that still applies to many of us today. THE MAGICIAN AS AN ANTIMYSTIC The course of spiritual development as described above was probably unavoidable con­sidering the historical circumstances, but now there really seems to be no point in con­tinuing to fight the current as contemporary magic does frequently enough anyway. Even revolutions have eventually outlived themselves in the end. What remains­ideally are their achievements. In our case, this includes the realization that magic is not only possible, but actually even more effective when it's freed from all religious and ethic burdens of the past. Through the changes that morals and ethics underwent dur­ing the twentieth century, the magician has learned to understand his or her art in a rel­ativistic and yet less religious-dogmatic sense.3 In the same way science had to free itself from the choking grip of priori religions and philosophies before it was able to begin its march of triumph throughout the entire world, magic needs to do the same before it can develop into a technology that's geared toward efficiency. Today magic is generally understood as a mere tool or skill. 218 Mysticism or Magic?"},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":"But if it's more than just this nonetheless, then the reason is that in contrast to the disciplines of natural science magic doesn't just deal with a tiny, restricted number of '(subtle', natural laws, but rather with an entire life process in which, once again in con­trast to science, the theory is perfect but the operand is not, as Ramsey Dukes once put it. The raw material of magic is the magician him-or herself si nce it always requires a Jiving medium, and a truly skilled magician is always one who has carefully weighed every aspect of one,s entire life. Now we're not referring to some kind of metaphysical \"pact with the devil,\" but rather to the fa ct that our reality is the product of our state of awareness. And the magician needs to be able to utilize, change, and manipulate this in order to be successful. We don't own the term \"magician\" and therefore have no right to swing the execu­tioner's axe by distinguishing between who is and who isn't a true magician. That's why it should be sufficient to say that the majority of modern magicians (as long as they don't cling solely to traditional systems) welcome this rebellion against the kind of n1ys­ticisn1 and religious dogmatism that have predominated fo r such a long time because it's this rebellion that allows the actual technical structures of magic to be worked out and defined in the first place. By restricting magic to one single technology and excluding all ontological questions and any talk of salvation, we create a greater degree of clarity about its effective mechanisms and can use these more efficiently for mystical pur­poses as well! In addition, modern humanity has recognized that by searching fo r the one, ((objec­tive\" truth, they're only avoiding the actual problem, nan1ely the creation of their own subjective truth. Maybe it would be more appropriate to describe the modern magician as an ((antimysticisf' instead of an <'antimystic.\" The search for the answers to the three gnostic questions, \"Who am I? Where did I come from? Where am I going?, is still com­mon to our time, as it will always be. Only the methods of finding the answers have changed, and the glasses through which we view the world. Probably the most important driving fo rce behind the magical rebellion against or-· thodox religiousness and mysticism is the release from all fe ars and relief of bad con­science that they both promise. The latter plays a fa tal role in magic since it paralyzes a great deal of our magical potential.

On the other hand, by eliminating the restricting fa ctors that we're consciously aware of (which is relatively easy to do), we can greatly improve our work. So we're not encouraging anyone to do away with religion and mysticism entirely, especially since the search fo r religio seems to be inherent in humans. The magician who has deep ties to religion and/or mysticism will eventually have to combine it with one,s magic, and that, too, is part of the Thelemic principle of\"Do what thou wilt.,, But in the interest of being successful in our practice, we'd like to remind you of a principle that we've discussed before: Magicians choose their beliefs like surgeons choose their instruments. When keeping this in mind, there,s really no room left over in one's outlook on the world fo r any «absolute,\" soul-saving beliefs. If you're not really interested in magical effectiveness or if it just doesn't play an im .. portant role in your work, then you're more of the religious-mystical type, and magic will never be any more to you than an intermediate step on the path to salvation. I. Of course, with this statement we're not assuming that these thinkers were ever practicing Buddhists. In­stead, they perceived Eastern Huddhism through their own \"filter\" made up of their own ideas and influ­enced by their own period in history. It's undeniable that Hinayana Buddhism in the nineteenth century was highly respected by scholars due to its rationalistic approach. 2. In order to avoid misunderstandings, we need to point out here as well that a mixed form is generally the rule in practice. Our sin1plification here is merely meant to help illustrate the basic positions in order to be able to understand the dispute better. 3.

But maybe the advantages and disadvantages should be mentioned here briefly. This method is generally preferred by people with artistic talent, such as painters, graphic designers, and architects, since it makes good use of their skiDs. It has a more ((natural'' effect on many magicians (similar to the mantric method of making sigils as well) since it doesn>t need to take the detour through the intellectual or linguistic part of the mind, and it doesn>t require use of a rational alphabet. Obviously this method is also more directly linked to the subconscious since it makes immediate use of pictures. State­ments of intent don't need to be fo rmulated in writing first, but can be converted di­rectly into pictogran1s, which is this method's greatest disadvantage as well. As al ready mentioned in connection with the symbol-logical fuzzy relation, it's difficult to be very precise when using pictures and symbols. Therefore the picture method isn't very suit­able fo r statements of intent and magical operations concerning exact numbers, dates, or measurements. If, fo r example, you want to meet a certain person on a certain day, you,d generally be better off using the word method instead of the picture method. 221"},{"pageNumber":231,"pageContent":"In addition, vague concepts such as \"realization, or \"happiness, are difficult to ex­press in pictures. But if that doesn,t seem to be a problem for you, fe el free to work with the picture method for such operations. In any case, ifs time you started working with this method in order to expand your spectrum of sigil magic skills and be able to determine which method works best for you. CHARGING A SIGIL TH ROUGH VISUALIZATION Generally sigils are charged through a sex magic operation or by means of the death posture, whereby the latter can take on many forms. British magicians in particular like to work with a method of charging that's a mixture between visualization and the death posture. Remember that the goal of the death posture is to eliminate all mental activity. An­other version often used by Spare is to gaze at your own fa ce in a mirror without letting the image blur. Since the human mind usually can't go any extended period of time without new stimuli, it will usually disfigure or add to the image, forcing a new meaning upon it. The fa ce in the mirror will twist and turn into strange shapes, an ugly grimace, or some other form. Try it out yourself. Just gaze at a plain white or gray wallpapered wall for ten minutes without letting yourself see pictures or patterns in it. In the same way, you'll probably start hearing words and phrases in the meaningless static noise of a radio under normal circumstances. If your reflection doesn,t distort, it will assume that your mind is no longer active and will try to project patterns and information into it, which usually takes the form of a change in your perception. Once this has happened, you've successfully internalized the sigil through intense visualization, and you can then end the operation by laughing spasmodically. In the Practical Exercises section, we've recommended a way for you to combine this technique with tratak, which you learned in the last section all in the interest of devel­oping your visualization skills of course. The only disadvantage to visualizing sigils is probably the fa ct that concentrating on the image of the symbol for such a long time makes it difficult to forget. But this, too, is just a matter of practice. 222 Practical Sigil Magic (Ill)"},{"pageNumber":232,"pageContent":"The main advantage of this method is that ifs an ((empty hand, technique, meaning that you're not dependent on anything to hold the sigil, such as a piece of paper or the like. That couJd be of great use, fo r example whenever you need to charge a sigil without being noticed, such as in the company of other people, in the waiting room of a doctor's office, while traveling in a train or an airplane, or anywhere else. EMOTIONS AND CHARGING SIGILS Beginners are often shocked at the composed and controlled way magicians can work with their emotions and are able to use them at will for specific magical operations. Sigil magic responds especially welJ to the use of extreme emotional states; when a magician is able to take one,s magical life seriously despite strong feelings of anger or fear and is able to use these emotions fo r magical operations, thereby never wasting any valuable energy, this is proof of one,s inner freedom and unsentimentality. Besides, magic is al­ways a bit of self-therapy anyway. For example, if you're afraid of riding a roller coaster, you could rid yourself of this restricting fear and use it productively at the same time by charging a sigil right at the moment your fe ar climaxes during a long ride, or several consecutive rides, you can charge the sigil again or charge several different sigils. Practice has shown that such op­erations are usually highly effective in both senses-·effectively charging the sigil and ef­fectively overcoming your fear. This is another reason why it can be quite valuable to take the time and make an exact list of your fears and emotions. With a little bit of imagination, you can develop quite a wide range of possibilities fo r your practical work and eliminate a great deal of your fears along the way. Try visualizing a sigil during your first parachute jump, fo r example! But don,t make the mistake in thinking that magic can only work with such extreme states of mind, which is a misconception that too many magicians the younger ones in particular · tend to believe. Rather, seeking out such extreme conditions is an integral part in the process of liberation or becoming whole that most magicians desire, and not as an end in itself or an indispensable component of magical technology. Nonetheless, there,s surely some truth in the belief that emotional excess leads to the best magical results. Practical Sigil Magic (Ill) 223"},{"pageNumber":233,"pageContent":"THE OMNIL FORMULA The OMNIL fo rmula was developed by the British magician Willian1 Gray, who wrote a number of excellent books. This fo rmula is described in his book Magical Ritual Meth­ods. The word OMNIL is a combination of the two Latin words omnis (everything) and nihil (nothing). Michael Gebauer summarized this as fo llows: \"Out of the emptiness, out of the nothingness [ ... ] , everything { ... ] can develop, everything I can create. In this so-called 'phase zero,, we experience the same distance to all fo rms of existence,, (Grund­lagen der Zeremonialmagie I). The OMNIL fo rmula is therefore a method fo r centering and fo r recognition at the same time; it serves to create a cosmic state of gnosis within the magician that represents the center of one's own universe. This universe (the ((every­thing,') is created out of the nothingness, and in between is where magic and all of life itself takes place. So the first thing we need to do is realize our «nihil, potential (called \"chaos, in Chaos Magic) before we can start applying it to truly become gods, which is the goal of most magical systems. The first step in reaching \"nihil'' is to thoroughly ban­ish everything that has no place in our universe because the power of chaos can only develop fully and freely in complete emptiness. Therefore we have to start at zero if we want to turn our magical cosmos into reality, because if the remains of other cosmoses are still floating around, this will muddle our crea6on and it won't be entirely our own. Gray described this quite clearly with the ritual question: \"What is the most important of all?', <<God.,, \"What is more important than God?\" \"Nothing is more important than God.\" \"Therefore let Nothing come before God.\" (Magical Ritual Methods, p. 27) He continues: \"We see now the esoteric significance of the injunction to: 'have no other Gods before Me.' That is not a command to abolish idols or other God-concepts than IHWH but a positive instruction to start from the Nil or Zero point before any concept of Deity whatever\" (ibid.). With his OMNIL fo rmula, he gave us a tool that we can use to \"zero ourselves,\" as he expresses it quite similar to the state of \"empty mind,, or samadhi and sa tori, used in Eastern styles of meditation.

This often takes the fo rm of ritual rebirth, a practice that can be traced back to the ancient mysteries of Eleusis right up to the current practices of Christian monasteries, Indian ashrams, and Western Freemason lodges, despite the fa ct that these all have quite different goals. Optically speaking, the OMNIL fo rmula closely resembles the lAO fo rmula that we discussed earlier, and indeed there are even certain mixed fo rms that combine the two elem.ents. But we'd like to concentrate on the pure fo rm of this technique fo r now, as Gray introduced it. Although his explanations are quite sparse, it shouldn,t be a problem to implement it into our practice with the knowledge of ritual magic that we already have. THE OMNIL FORMULA IN PRACTICE In a place where you won't be disturbed, stand fa cing the east or north and fo cus your attention on the supreme (\"divine'' ) above you and the life that exists below you. With the energy of your awareness now fo cused, draw a horizontal circle around yourself. Use your magicaJ wand or dagger if you like although this should only be necessary at the beginning. This circle is Zero-time. Now draw a lateral circle starting at the zenith (the top of your head) to the right, continue to the nadir and then back up along the left side until you finally reach the zenith again. This is Zero-space. Then draw a vertical circle starting at the zenith and down in front of your.body, going back up your back until you reach the zenith again. This is Zero-event. Make sure you draw all circles deosil (clockwise). Ideally you should draw or project aJl three simultaneously, which will become easier each time you practice. After a bit of practice, the whole exercise shouldn't take more than a split second. Ifs extremely powerful, stabilizes the magical operation, fo cuses your concentration, and works on a symbol-logical level, which is basically what the Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram does in a more ritual sense. Gebauer compared its effect to that of the Kabbalistic Cross, but this doesn't cover all aspects of how you can implement the OMNIL fo rmula. Try to determine fo r yourself the similarities and differences in the two. Practical Sigil Magic (III) 225"},{"pageNumber":235,"pageContent":"USE OF THE OMNIL FORMULA The OMNIL fo rmula is rarely used alone, but as an introduction to a larger ritual, and sometimes even as part of the Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram. But since it can be performed easily anywhere, it can be implemented into your everyday routine, for ex­ample as a concentration aid before doing mentally demanding work, for centering your­self in emotional situations, and so on. The value of this exercise cannot be overesti­mated, and experience has shown that it also hardens the aura just like the lAO formula. Michael Gebauer developed a mixed version of the lAO and OMNIL fo rmulas. In his version, the vowels/, A, and 0 are vibrated respectively as each circle is drawn. But we recommend that you keep the exercises separate fo r now so that you can become thoroughly familiar with the various energy qualities of each before experimenting with the mixed fo rm later.' COMMENTS ON IMAGINATION TRAINING Magical literature often starts off by focusing on the training of magical imagination, whereby visualization is usually meant, although we've repeated several times that mag­ical perception doesn,t necessarily have to be visual. Now practice has shown that many people only have difficulties with visualization exercises when these are specifically designated as such, probably because this kind of training was (and sometimes still is today) overestimated by many authors. This creates a high pressure to succeed, which ends up being more detrimental to good imagination skills than it benefits them. In fact, everything we refer to as \"the training of magical per­ception\" is actually the training of your imagination, although our passive method is much more effective than an active approach when first starting out. In the future, we,ll continue to avoid putting too much pressure on our apprentice magicians by keeping our training methods as simple as possible and by embedding our visualization exercises into practical work, such as we did right at the start with the Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram. So don,t worry that your imagination skills might be lacking just trust in our system and get comfortable working with the techniques given here even though you're not yet a master of visualization or even magical hallucination. There are many paths leading to magic, and the example of sigil magic shows how little we often need to work effectively. 226 Practical Sigil Magic (Ill) •"},{"pageNumber":236,"pageContent":"One characteristic of magical imagination is the fa ct that it often isn,t consciously perceived as such. Thafs one thing it has in common with magical trance. While the magic of earlier days fo cused more on projection (active imagination projection), today • we tend to concentrate more on active perception; the latter is considered more natural since its basic structure stems back to shamanic practices. Even though many n1agicians may achieve good results with the projection method, my own personal experience has given me the strong impression that a fo cus on percep­tion will bring about better results. Therefore it's not so important to visualize and pro­ject the in1age of a desired event as powerfully and with as much concentration as pos­sible, but rather to perceive it as precisely as possible (even fo r just a short period of tin1e) and to get a fe el of its energy quality. After all, one of the insights of modern magic states that: Precision is more important than power This certainly doesn,t undermine the importance of imagination; we're only saying that the second structural fo rmula of magic seems to be qualitatively superior to the first. In practice, this difference isn,t distinguished as strictly as it might seem to be in theory. However, thorough imagination training is imperative fo r people who either have difficulty with magical perception (perceptional blockades) or who are overwhelmed with inner pictures (image fl ooding).ln the first case, the person needs to train the abil­ity of image/subtle perception in the first place, while in the second case, the person needs to learn to control and master it i.n order to prevent oneself fr om constantly drift­ing off into daydreams, which is fa tal to magic most of the time. This is why we chose a solid middle course fo r our training program that attempts to make imagination easier by making it controllable and manageable. INTRODUCTION TO ASTROMAGIC The field of astrological magic (more commonJy called astromagic) is so comprehensive and specialized that it would be impossible fo r us to cover it in detail here. Those of you who already have sound knowledge of astrology as well as some experience in the field as well can just skim over this section. Practical Sigil Magic (III) 227"},{"pageNumber":237,"pageContent":"We don't want to commit ourselves here to any certain astrological system since as­trology is always subjective and purely a matter of personal experience. It doesn't matter if you work with classical astrology, or if you prefer the Placid us house systen1, the Koch (GOH) system, or maybe even the equal house system, or if you fo llow the teachings of the Hamburg School or Ebertins, cosmobiology, or represent the Hubers School or the Munich Rhythm School the important thing is how you integrate astrology into your magic, if at all. There are a number of magicians who prefer not to use astrology in their work at all, and there are good reasons fo r this. Astrology is meant to fa miliarize humans with the cosmic principles according to the Hermetic belief\"As above, so below.\" With this infor­mation, humans are able to link the rhythm of the heavenly bodies to their own fa te. It's a powerfuJ instrument of self-knowledge and prediction that can be a valuable magical tool fo r putting the finishing touch on magicaJ operations by coordinating them with favorable time periods by means of astrological knowledge. But there,s a catch to this. Whoever makes oneself so dependent on astrology that one can only work during certain planetary constellations, or always blames fa ilure on '' unfavorable', planetary influences instead of loolOng fo r the fa ult within, such as one's carelessness or lack of attention and concentration, and whoever ignores the golden rule that the stars can tilt something in a certain direction but can never fo rce it there such a person will never be a good magician. We can rarely pick the constellations we want anyway. If you absolutely need a Jupiter .. Saturn trine to perform a certain ritual because your paradigm makes you dependent on it, you might have to wait fo r years until the right time comes along. And if it needs to be a transiting Saturn to put a certain aspect on your birth Jupiter, you might even have to wait fo r up to twenty-eight years. It gets even more complicated when you need a combination of several planetary aspects, e.g., if you need a conjunction of Mercury and Jupiter that at the same time fo rms a trine with Saturn and a sextile with the tip of your fifth house .... 2 Moreover, astrology can even become a real burden by making the magician dependent on it fo r one's predic­tions, thereby restricting one in freedom of choice (a problem that all divinatory systems pose), or when the magician's concept of oneself is only understood in astrological terms (\"I can,t really change anyway because Capricorns are like that ... \"). 228 Practical Sigil Magic (III)"},{"pageNumber":238,"pageContent":"This is why we advise beginners against linking their magic too closely with astrol­ogy, although we have no intentions of downplaying its significance.

And it's certainly useful to take advantage of fa vorable planetary positions when they just happen to occur, such as fo r charging a planetary talisman or amulet or when attacking an opponent when he or she is weakest. After all, astrology has always played a significant role throughout the history of Western magic, and in the interest of getting a general, comprehensive magical educa­tion, no magician should refrain from studying the subject thoroughly. In magical alchemy it's even a necessity, and it's also next to impossible to understand a great deal of magical literature without a good knowledge of astrology. Plus it's probably one of the most comprehensive yet fa scinating fields of the occult sciences and could never be thoroughly exhausted in one lifetime.

They say that the Ve netians made glasses which changed colour if poison was put into them; of such a glass must the student make his Cup (Magick, p. 73). These instructions should be understood metaphorically, of course. This is a good time to point out that simply making the magical weapons isn't enough. They not only stand fo r abstract elemental principles, but also reflect the magician's current spiritual stage of development. This is a good reason why you should never restrict the making of your magical weapons to a certain time frame.1 23 1"},{"pageNumber":241,"pageContent":"While the magician will probably have the least difficulty making one's wand or sword, it might take one many years until the cup is perfect. This isn't a question of technical skill, but rather of mental maturity and development of character.

The cup is therefore a symbol and tool of the magician.,s developed instinct and trained intuition. lfs dangerous until ifs perfect. \"This Cup is fu ll of bitterness, and of blood, and of intoxication\" (ibid., p. 73 ). Having a subconscious that's too receptive, that accepting every fo reign influence imaginable without criticism, is equal to having a de­fe ctive censor. Delusions and a general loss of one.,s grip on reality are the most common results. The cup doesn't just receive, but it also gives shape the water that's poured into it adapts to its fo rm, but loses its shape just as soon as it's poured out again. In this sense, the cup can also be viewed as a symbol fo r shaped illusion: The images the magician re­ceives require structure in order to become effective. If they remain without structure or fo rm, they,ll destroy their environment; wine becomes a corrosive acid and destroys the vessel. Here are a fe w more quotations from Crowley that you should meditate on: The Cup can hardly be described as a weapon. It is ro und like the Pa ntacle not straight like the Wa nd and the Dagger. Reception, not projection, is its nature. (ibid., p. 73 ). Concerning the water in this Cup, it may be said that just as the Wa nd should be perfe ctly rigid, the ideal solid, so should the water be the ideal fluid. The Wa nd is erect, and must extend to Infinity. The surfa ce of the water is flat, and must extend to Infinity. But as the Wa nd is weak without breadth, so is the water fa lse without depth. The Understanding of the Magus must include all things, and that understanding must be infinitely profound (ibid., p. 74). The surfa ce of the water in the Magick Cup is infinite; there is no point different fr om any other point. Thus, ultimately, as the Wa nd is a binding and a limitation, so is the Cup an ex­pansion ·into the Infinite. 232 Introduction to Ritual Magic (VI)"},{"pageNumber":242,"pageContent":"And this is the danger of the Cup; it must necessarily be open to all, and yet if any­thing is put into it which is out of proportion, unbalanced, or impure, it takes hurt (ibid., p. 78 ).

PRACTICAL EXERCISES EXERCISE 27 THE OMNIL FORMULA IN PRACTICE For fo ur weeks in a row, experiment daily with the OMNIL fo rmula as de­scribed further above. You can integrate it into your practice of the Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram or perform it in a manner similar to the lAO fo rmula. But don't neglect the IAO fo rmula completely since both exercises supplement each other quite well. For example, you could per­fo rm the lAO fo rmula in the morning and the OMNIL formula in the evening. Again, record your impressions in your magical diary. EXERCISE 28 ASTRAL MAGIC AND MEDITATION (11) This exercise is similar to Exercise 23 in the last section with the one dif­fe rence that you should concentrate on getting smaller each time you ex­hale.

After each exercise, imagine yourself getting bigger with each in­haled breath. EXERCISE 29 PRACTICAL ASTROMAGIC If you haven't done so yet, get a hold of your personal horoscope. It does­n't matter whether you calculate it yourself or print it out on a computer. But in case of the latter, you only need an actual calculation and not an in­terpretation computerized interpretations are utterly useless fo r a living human being since its method of calculation is rigid and stiff. If you de­cide to calculate your horoscope yourself, make sure to use serious tables (ephemerides and house tables) and not the ((approximate, tables that you,ll find in most cheap horoscope books since these are notoriously in­accurate. In order to calculate a horoscope, you'll need the fo llowing informa­tion: date of birth (day, month, year); place of birth; exact time of birth (watch out fo r daylight saving time! ). You may be able to find the exact time of birth on your birth certificate (unfortunately, this is not always the case). Otherwise, try enquiring at the local courthouse, or asking your parents or other relatives. Such information might not always be the most reliable, but we need to do the best we can with the information we have.2 Your horoscope should be calculated according to the classical method and should contain the fo llowing information: planetary positions houses (sometimes called ((fields,,; Placidus or Koch system) aspects For now, just the ((larger aspects', are sufficient conjunction (0°), opposi­tion (180°), sextile (60°), square (90°), and trine (30°). If you're a beginner to astrology, study your horoscope in detail with the help of reference books (see recommended literature at the end of this 234 Introduction to Ritual Magic (VI)"},{"pageNumber":244,"pageContent":"section). This is surely not the most intelligent and reliable method, but there,s unfortunately no other way fo r the astrological layman but to plow one,s way through. So if you know absolutely nothing about astrology, you'lJ have no other choice but to work your way into the material until you've thoroughly memorized its symbols and the choreography of their energies, and learned how to virtuously interpret their many possible combinations. Meanwhile, through your practice of the hexagram ritual, you should already have a fa irly reliable fe eling fo r the subtle planetary en­ergies, which will help you quite a bit. Also, start paying attention to transits, or the crossing of the planets over your own natal chart. If you don,t have a lot of experience yet, con­centrate on just two or three planets at first (e.g., moon, Jupiter, and Sat­urn). Note their aspects and positions in your natal chart, e.g., on which day Jupiter in transit fo rms an opposition with Jupiter in your natal chart, or when Saturn in transit fo rms a square with Saturn in your natal chart, or when the moon in transit fo rms a conjunction with the moon in your natal chart, and so on. At the same time, pay attention to the effect that such transits have on your magical perception and your magic as a whole if any, because as we already mentioned, not everyone reacts in the same way to transits. Do this fo r at least one year until you,re thoroughly fa miliar with your horo­scope as well as with your reaction to such transits. The purpose of this exercise isn't to make you dependent on such astrological factors, but rather to train your fe eling fo r the link between cosmic energy and fa te. If you're completely new to astrology, be patient with yourself and don't expect too much at first. Through your previous practice of the planetary rituals, you should find it a bit easier to understand the plane­tary powers, but learning astrology involves its long-tern1 study before you'll have enough knowledge to effectively be able to work with it. If, on the other hand, you)re already an experienced astrologer, you've probably already done these exercises in one fo rm or another.

FURTHER READING Today there are so many excellent books on astrology available that ifs difficult to choose just a few to list here. You can find more detailed information on astrological ta­bles and charts (ephemerides, house tables, geographic position tables) in New Age bookstores. Classical astrology mainly works with Placid us house tables, but modern as­trology often uses the system developed by Walter Koch (also called GOH, Geburt­sortshoroskop, (' birthplace horoscope\"). When buying books containing ephemerides, make sure that they contain calcula­tions fo r Pluto, which wasn,t discovered until l930. (Some books didn't incorporate this planet into their calculations until the early 1960s!) Today, fo r technical reasons, the midnight ephemeris is generally preferred over the midday ephemeris.

It was and still is fe ared from the North Pole to the South and ethnographers consid.er it to be the perfect exam­ple of \"common superstition.\" But while ethnologists and anthropologists just scoff at the stories about this magic gaze, considering it to be nothing more than a fa scinating remnant of prehistoric times, magicians take it seriously and practice it widely. There have been many explanations fo r the way it works, but this phenomena is ac­tually way too complex to describe in just a few sentences since it actually includes a great number of different \"gazes.\" In other words, the magic gaze has a great deal of var­ious functions and can be trained and applied accordingly. We'd like to dedicate several sections of this book to this topic since it will also help us train our magicaJ perception at the same time and give us a powerful tool fo r magically influencing others. You've probably heard the expression (( If looks could killr' Well, from a magician's point of view, they can although only in rare cases but they can also cause a lot of sustained damage. Nonetheless, it would be wrong to only consider the negative aspect of this practice because it can be used just as well fo r healing, clairvoyance, and calming down overexcited people or animals. The main reason why the magic gaze has such a bad reputation is probably due to the fa ct that its technique and function have basically been unknown fo r such a long period of time. 239"},{"pageNumber":249,"pageContent":"To make things more difficult, the '<evil eye\" is often used instinctively by completely untrained people with a natural talent. But such people are usually outsiders (just like most other sensitive people are, such as psychics, clairvoyants, and so on) that are often ridiculed for the fa ct that they,re different, forcing them to use this gaze for destructive purposes in pure self-defense. After all, the bringer of bad news is often identified with the bad news itself and therefore punished for it. For exan1ple, if a seer uses the magic gaze and happens to see the death of someone that walks by hin1 on the st reet, and he carelessly shares this information with other people, he,s putting himself in a pretty dangerous position (during the Inquisition, this could even have been deadly). At best, nothing will happen and people will just laugh at him or brush him off as being '�not quite right in the head.,, But if his prediction comes true, there wiU be plenty of sharp tongues who mix up cause and effect to such a severe degree that they'U end up blaming the seer and his magic gaze for the death of that person. Since the eyes are considered to be the \"window to the soul,', magic has always worked with various eye techniques; these techniques are either used in magical opera­tions or to disguise the eyes themselves (e.g., hiding one's thoughts). The eyes can reveal a great deal about a person,s current state of mind, and usually they'H signify change well ahead of any change in the person,s expression or gestures. The best ways to use the magic gaze that we should concern ourselves with now are listed below. In order to save room, we,ve only given short explanations of each since most will become self-explanatory throughout the course of your work. 1) To concentrate the power of thought and fo cus on a specific thing: requires no tar­get person (no \"victim,,), but serves as a technique fo r thought control in general. 2) To transfer magical impulses (commands) to a target person without one's knowledge in order to influence him or her: for use ranging from aura and chakra manipulation for healing purposes to the implantation of an exploding glyph in the person's aura. 3) To disguise one's own state of mind and intentions: disguising one,s own eyes or putting on a fa ke expression (e.g., friendly instead of grim). 4) To perceive subtle energies and direct them as well as for clairvoyance: an exten­sion of one,s own range of perception for the pu rpose of manipulation or gazing 240 The Magic Gaze (I)"},{"pageNumber":250,"pageContent":"into the future (e.g., in the magic mirror or crystal ball). 5) To scan another person in order to determine other's strengths and weaknesses: detern1ining and diagnosing a situation (e.g., in healing operations, n1agical war­fa re, etc.) before beginning a magical operation. 6) Extracting energy or information from a target person: aura and chakra manipu­lation by tapping the victim's subtle energies, causing him or her to weaken until (although quite rare) completely emptied of odic fo rce; but also used fo r tapping undesired energies that cause an illness or in exorcisms; furthermore, fo r dupli­cating and \"recording,, conscious and unconscious information thafs stored in the target person. In contrast to the 180° gaze that we've already discussed, the magic gaze is a so-called fixation technique. Here, the eyes are not \"defocused,, but rather just the opposite·­they're fo cused on a specific point. While the 180° gaze (which, technically speaking, actually belongs to the wider cate­gory of«magic gazes'') is mainly used fo r passive perception, or receiving subtle sensory impulses and expanding one,s awareness, the magic gaze in general (with the exception of numbers 4 and 5) has the task of sending subtle sensory impulses and concentrating awareness and energy into one point of fo cus. Its power is due to the fa ct that a person tends to pay particular attention to changes around the eye area when conversing with others, thereby receiving lots of other infor­mation fr om them that goes above and beyond the contents of the actual conversation itself · and often without even being aware of it. Often enough, all you have to do is refuse direct eye contact to make the other person nervous or even to make him or her mad fo r seemingly no reason at aU. Try it out yourself. Whenever you talk to people, gaze at the spot directly between their eyes (ajna chakra). Don't look into their eyes while talking, but keep your eyes \"peeled,, on them as described above and talk completely normal. This is also a good ex­ercise fo r magicians who have trouble looking people in the eye. The clever point of this trick is that the other people can never see through you. You,re not avoiding their gaze because they're looking directly into your eyes all the time, but they aren,t able to see where they,re fo cused (they can,t \"catch your gaze',), and their own uncertainty bounces right back to them with fu ll fo rce.

So if your boss is screaming at you fo r supposedly making a mistake, you can easily stand up to his or her tirade by ap­plying this technique, and the more he or she loses inner strength and security, the more yours wiU grow. On the other hand, you should use this technique sparingly, otherwise the other person could get uncontro11ably mad, which isn't always desired. The fo llowing experiment will prove that the effectiveness of th is gaze doesn't have to be limited to direct eye contact and that it cannot be explained with the tools of com­mon psychology (\"intimidating look,,}: The next time you find yourself sitting in a movie theater, bus, streetcar, train, or air­plane, gaze at the back of someone's head. The best spot to gaze at is the back of the neck, or ((death chakra,n located in the center just above where the backbone starts. Do this until your \"victim, either turns around, scratches his or her neck, or wiggles around nervously. Then try it on a new target person. Experiment with various distances, fo r example by first choosing someone in the next row directly in front of you, and then someone five or ten rows away. Of course, you can try this out in a restaurant as well to get the waitstaff's attention when they seem to be deliberately avoiding you. Once you,ve mastered this technique to your own satisfaction, try looking right through the target people as though they were made of glass by staring through the same spot on the back of their neck. At first you,U be doing this with your eyes open, but later they'll be half-closed or even closed entirely. This method will be even more effec­tive if you thoroughly train your eyes in the technique of fixation, which is imperative fo r further work with the magic gaze anyway. To do so, use the fixation circle pictured in Illustration 19 on page 243. Yo u can use it in three ways: l) Separate page 243 from the book and fo ld back the bottom so that you're not ir­ritated by the printing. 2) Copy the page and cut out the middle part with the circle. 3) Draw your own circle by using our illustration as a guide.

In contrast to the 180° gaze which uses the blurred vision technique this exercise strains the eyes even more and un­equally at that, which is why it's important to be careful! 1 The skills developed with this technique can be applied to many things. It does much more than just train your magic gaze as a means fo r influencing others; it will also make working with the magic mirror easier, as we'll begin discussing later in this chapter. Once again, we need to emphasize that this fixation technique is not the same as the 180° gaze! So pJease avoid accidentally slipping into the wrong exercise. For now, make a clear distinction between tratak and the magic gaze. • J. For this exercise, you should remove any seeing aids (especially contact lenses) since the eyes need to be trained in their natural state in order to be magically effective.

Actually, the wand represents the element of Fire in the Hermetic tradition of the Golden Dawn. As such, ifs always been the subject of much discussion. Surely one of the reasons fo r this is the fa ct that the element of Fire stands fo r sexuality, among other things, and even in magical operations that have nothing to do with sexual themes or sex magic, certain aspects are often bashfully concealed or disguised, and sometimes even become the object of pompous, mystical speculation, such as the case with AJeister Crowley at times. In this connection, however, we need to keep one important fa ct in mind: Every ma­gician and every generation of magicians will treat the magical weapons with vari­ous degrees of importance depending on one's own individual preferences and insuffi­ciencies. Crowley hardly even mentions the dagger, fo r example, while the wand seems to be the most important weapon of all to him. However, instead of dealing with it in connection with ritual work (his statements on the weapons are a great exception any­way), he wrote pages and pages about the importance of the Magical Will and Magical Oath, which will probably confuse beginners even more instead of enlightening them. Even Bardon called the wand «the most important tool in ritual magic, and pointed out 245"},{"pageNumber":255,"pageContent":"that magicians have been depicted holding a wand since the beginning of time. Even modern-day stage magicians whom we prefer to call \"illusionists, (according to their own terminology) in order to avoid misunderstandings want their audiences to be­lieve that their n1agic wand can give then1 their seemingly supernatural powers to per­fo rm aH kinds of miracles. Bardon, like Crowley (who owes much more to the fo rmer than his fo llowers like to believe) views the dagger as a rather subordinate weapon. fn fa ct, they both treat it as merely a miniature sword with no mentionable symbolism of • 1ts own. The increased significance of the dagger in the fe w last decades is most likely due to the influence of the Anglo-Saxon Wicca tradition. With every right, this tradition claims that it has undergone a considerable paradigm shift since the end ofWor1d War II con­cerning the magic of Europe and North America, which in my opinion has never been mentioned in the relevant literature as of yet: the wand being replaced by the dag­ger in its fu nction as th.e embodiment of the magical will. In the angular tradition today, the dagger is rarely used, and when so, only as a substitute fo r the sword. If you read older literature on magic, you'll have to keep in mind that the wand is generally considered to be the main elemental weapon. It represents the magician's will and symbolizes one's power and might. On the other hand, Bardon, for example, works with several different wands with each being used fo r a different purpose or consecrated fo r a different sphere, but he uses only one single sword although he considers the dagger and trident to be suitable substitutes as well, especially fo r demonic operations. How does modern magic use the wand? As already mentioned, it's a symbol of the ele­ment of Fire. As such, it embodies vitality and the will, both in a biological sense as well as in a psychological and magical one. The analogy \"wand = will, becomes clearer when we also look at the word \"action\" as its tertium comparationis. Essentially, the wand is an active weapon: a symbol fo r 1nagical action and taking effect, the assumption and exer­cising of personal power. But since it also represents sexuality, it's sometin1es depicted in phallic fo rm, especially in older, patriarchal traditions. And this is exactly why the para­digm shift we mentioned inevitably had to take place in more modern times. The gen­eral departure from the phallocratic, patriarchal, maJe-dominated image of the world that early magicians held expressed itself quite unnoticeably in the gradual changeover from the wand to the dagger. Today, ifs difficult fo r us to accept that a magician's entire 246 Introduction to Ritual Magic (VII)"},{"pageNumber":256,"pageContent":"wiU is embodied in only one element, namely Fire. The dagger, on the other hand, is not an elemental weapon, so in the lines of modern thought it corresponds better to the will, which is supposed to be the master of the elements and therefore logically cannot be just one of them. At least this is one of the arguments of modern magic that we should at least take into serious consideration, even though every person should decide fo r oneself whether or not one might prefer to fo llow the old tradition instead. In any case, we'll have to delve deeper into the symbolism and philosophy of magical thinking fo llowing our discussion of the ritual weapons so that we don't get stuck on the level of\"lower,, or everyday practical magic, regard.Jess of how important this certainly is. Nonetheless, the wand is and remains an important magical weapon, although today,s versatile modern magician will certainly hesitate to claim that any si ngle weapon is the \"most important,,, even though one most likely will have a better relationship to some weapons than to others. All magical weapons are principally equal. Apart from their function or element classification, the only thing that differentiates one from the other is our own opinion about them. In the sense of a holistic, harmonic image of the world, it would be unacceptable to give one element precedence over another. While the cup receives and gives birth, the wand becomes the manifestation of the will, or its executive body. 1 However, this is not the same as the complete identification of the will and the wand! Picture the wand as a sort of «right hand'' of your own magi­cal will. It embodies creation and action. While the cup is centripetal (moving toward centralization) and fe minine, the wand is centrifugal (moving away from centralization) and male. When dipped in cold water, the hot wand will cause vaporization, thereby cre­ating air: Thought itself is born out of the polarity of the sexes, and even earth is a child of this primeval union. The wand is therefore power and driving fo rce at the same time, but aJso the power of control over itself and control over the universe that it creates. But the wand doesn't cre­ate entirely on its own it needs the cup. Blind action without firm intuition is a waste of energy and life. The lingan1 (phallus, wand) must unite with the yoni (vagina, cup); only the interaction between yin and yang can arouse the energy that leads to creation. It is action that makes a magician truly a n1agician. Whoever just sits in a room spec­ulating on the possibilities of magic without fa cing the bitter winds of practice will re­main nothing but a bloodless theorist and never be able to fo rce ((Dark Brother Fear,, to its knees. That's why the wand is also the symbol of fearlessness.

The wand can be of any form it's often depicted as a phallus or as the staff of the Egyptian god Thot or Tahuti, who corresponds to Hermes and Mercury. The Golden Dawn prefers the Hermes staff with the double snake, while modern Chaos Magic de­veloped the wand into a lightning bolt from the Chaos Sphere.

In any case, it should fit firmly in your grip and not be too lightweight. THE MAGIC MIRROR Before you start working with the magic mirror which is a fa scinating and diversified field you should already have a good deaJ of experience with the 180° gaze (defocus­ing) as weU as with the magic gaze (fixation) described in this section in order to achieve optimal results. If you want to make your own mirror, you can train these eye tech­niques parallel to working on it. Goal fo r beginners: the ability to gaze fo r three to six minutes without any twitching of the eyes. Midterm goaJ: about ten to fifteen minutes. Strictly speaking, the magic mirror is not a ritual weapon but one of your magical tools. However, in practice this isn,t completely true since the magic mirror is really one of the best weapons in magical warfare, such as fo r influencing a target person from a distance, distant tapping of one's odic fo rce, and so on. Most authors describe the magic mirror as a tool fo r divination and in this function it resembles the crystal ball. If it is only used fo r divination and evocation, the magic mirror can basically be made of any shiny material: glass, crystal, gemstones, or similar. There are even ((tempo­rary,, magic mirrors, fo r example, when the magician fills a bowl with water or dark oil that's poured out after the operation. Even a black-painted thumbnail can be used! Some magicians prefer to use their magic cup fo r divinatory operations instead of using • a separate mlrror. 248 Introduction to Ritual Magic (VII)"},{"pageNumber":258,"pageContent":"However, the term \"magic mirror\" usually refers to a special tool thafs often called a ((black mirror,, as well. The reason fo r this is obvious it has a black surface. The surface is usually concave, or bent inward, and is either made of common glass or shiny rock, such as obsidian or even polished coal. Metals can also be used, preferably steel or silver, whereby the latter will turn ((black\" automatically through oxidation. Generally most modern magicians use a so-called clock glass mirror, which is why we,ve decided to deal with it in more detail here. The easiest way to make such a mirror is by obtaining a clock glass that's about fo ur to seven inches in diameter. The external, bulged side is then blackened. Theoretically this is easily done but there are a number of ways to do it wrong. In order to spare you from unnecessarily wasting your time, we,d like to list a few unsuitable methods here that beginners often attempt. After all, the wheel doesn't have to be rediscovered every day! Practice has shown that common glass paint is not really suited fo r blackening since it doesn't actually get black enough. The glass remains too transparent. Using soot (e.g., by holding the clock glass over a candle) is problematic because the coating is easily scratched and scraped. If you wanted to frame the clock glass later on, which is recom­mended anyway and absolutely necessary if you used this method of blackening, you,d need to be extremely careful, otherwise you'd have to keep trying to cover up the scratch marks. Black wax, on the other hand, usually blisters just like synthetic plastic and sticks irregularly to the glass, giving it an undesired texture that will distract your eyes instead of focusing them. Plus, it's quite sensitive to heat. The best method is to simply paint the surface of the glass with the kind of under­coating paint thafs used fo r cars (available in automotive stores). (Gregor A. Gregorius recommends tar paint.) This will give you a smooth, opaque black color that's just per­fe ct fo r your work with the mirror. The magician can design the frame in any way one desires. Magic mirrors can have all possible kinds of frames: round, square, pentagonal, oval, and so on. l'he round fo rm is the most common, and usually the frame is just made of plain, black-painted wood. Stained wood will distract your eyes because of the wood grain, but some magicians prefer this kind anyway. Generally, we recommend that you not press the clock glass into a synthetic plastic fo rm since it will usually come loose after awhile. Instead, a skilled Introduction to Ritual Magic (VII) 249"},{"pageNumber":259,"pageContent":"plast.ics molder could make the mirror and frame all at once, entirely out of synthetic plastic. Papier-mache is sometimes used as well. A more complicated method of making a magic mirror is to cut a flat slab out of a large, black gemstone and polish it, which any good gem cutter should be able to do. As already mentioned, the most common material fo r this is obsidian, but smaller fo rmats are occasionally made of onyx. In older magic literature you,ll find many different ways to make a magic mirror. However, most of the books agree that after it's completed and consecrated, no other person than the magician him-or herself should be allowed to look into i.t. Thafs why the mirror should always be covered up when not in use and hidden from prying eyes. Traditionally, it's wrapped in black silk or velvet or sometimes kept in a closeable box. The reason fo r this is both psychological as well as symbol-logicaL Firstly, in older literature, the mirror is mainly used fo r divination and acts as a gateway to the magi­cian,s soul, or unconscious, and no unauthorized persons should be allowed to enter fro m the other side. That's why many fo rtunetellers never let their clients touch their cards or crystal balls. Secondly, tradition requires that aU magical weapons only be han­dled by their owner, since an outsider could destroy the subtle energy that they,ve been painstakingly charged with through elaborate ritual procedures. The same applies to \"touching with the eyes., Thirdly, the conscious mind develops a sort of inner confidence when it owns ob­jects that no other person is allowed to handle, which surely has to do with the fa ct that the subconscious then fe els more comfortable (or '<unnoticed'') when it opens up, there­fo re enabling a state of trance to be reached. REPORTS FROM MAGICAL PRACTICE (1) With this little series, we'd like to round off our training by reporting occasionally on experiences from everyday magical work. AU examples are absolutely authentic and originate either from my own practice or that of other magicians. They serve the pur­pose of showing and illustrating the basic principles of magic in such a way that we can only experience through practice.

Only those examples that can easily be found in other literature that's available to the public haven,t been changed. Frater A. in D. discovered firsthand the importance of correctly formulating his statement of intent in sigil magic. He made a sigil according to the word method with the statement of intent \"I will have 500 doUars within two weeks', and charged it by means of sex magic. After about one and a half weeks, Frater A. visited a friend and sat down on his couch in the living room. After awhile, the friend began looking fo r his wallet and started getting nervous because it contained a large sum of money. Finally, they discov­ered that Frater A. had accidentally sat down on his friend's wallet. You can imagine how astonished Frater A. was when he fo und out that the sum of money in the wallet was identical to the sum he had charged a sigil for, right down to the last cent. What hap­pened? Obviously his subconscious took the word \"have\" a little to literally. The unusual thing about this incident is the fact that Frater A. tried a second time by rewording his statement of intent to make it more clear to his subconscious that he wanted to get the desired amount. Usually such \"touch-up jobs,, are rarely successful, es­pecially if they fo llow just a short time after the fa iled operation. After all, this example shows us that we never need to give up hope and certainly should try another attempt. When fo rmulating our statement of intent, we should always remember the fa ct that our subconscious prefers the path of less resistance (at least that's how it seems to our conscious mind) when fulfilling a magical task. In Frater A.'s situation, it was surely eas­ier to get someone else,s money by sitting on it. But this example also points out a com­mon problem of sigil magic and working with statements of intent: It's nearly impossi­ble to completely eliminate all potential false interpretations (or to be more exact, \"all too literal interpretations))) when formulating a statement of intent. So there's really no other choice but trial and error with the goal of developing a certain sensitivity for the language that our own subconscious mind speaks. This can only be achieved through frequent practice and careful monitoring of the results. The following episode is taken from my own practice. A fe male client asked me to apply my magic to make her husband agree to a divorce according to the terms that she stipulated. Although he principally agreed to a divorce, he only wanted to commit to a Introduction to Ritual Magic (VII) 251"},{"pageNumber":261,"pageContent":"minimum in financial obligations for his wife and their three children, which caused quite a bit of dispute that even turned violent at times.

Work in a playful manner so you don't get tired of it, but also practice regularly and seriously (especially with the eye fixation chart) in order to get good re­sults as soon as possible. EXERCISE 32 THE MAGIC GAZE (11) You need a partner fo r this exercise. In fa ct, you can even practice with children since they seem to like this exercise and often have extremely good results, as long as you don,t fo rce them to do anything they don,t want to do. The purpose of this exercise is to develop a fe el fo r receiving the magic gaze so that you notice when someone uses it against you an important aspect of magical protection! You can do this exercise either in­doors or outside. The sender should sit comfortably on the floor since the optical send­ing perspective is better this way, although it will surely work from any po­sition. Stand comfortably with your back to your partner no less than ten feet away from him or her, yet no more than twenty-five fe et away fo r the start. According to my experience this is the average optimal distance, al ­though it naturally may vary some. It would be best to close your eyes, breathe deeply and relax fo r a fe w minutes, then give your partner a signal with your hand so that he or she can start. If you're not a complete begin­ner, you can also work with your eyes open. Now your partner will gaze at a certain part of your body, and your job is to find out what he or she)s staring at. Rely entirely on your own intu­ition. In any case you should avoid rationally thinking about where you would gaze if you were the other person.

Your partner shouldn't try to \"send, you any­thing, nor should he or she try to cause a certain sensation (burning, itch­ing, or similar) or impatiently wait fo r you to shudder in fe ar.

(Al­ways remember the principle of\"nonattachment/nonlack of interesf'!) For now, practice as the receiver fo r just five to ten minutes. Now ex­change roles with your partner. If both partners still fe el like practicing, you can do the exercise again, but more than that is not recommended since the unknown organ that we use fo r subtle perception gets tired quickly, which could impair the results (and therefore affect later results as well). THE MAGIC GAZE (11) Now we'd like to go into more detail about the actual use of the magic gaze. In order to do so, we'll discuss the individual points mentioned in the last section. I) Concentrating the Power of Thought and Focus on a Specific Thing This exercise requires no target person (or \"victim\"), but serves as a technique fo r • thought control in general. We practice this gaze fo r the sole purpose of mastering the control of our thoughts and fo cusing our will. Practice has shown repeatedly that a magical process is initiated in the subconscious by the mere focusing of one's gaze. Compare the death posture technique used fo r charging a sigil in which the eyes are fo cused to obtain the desired state of gnosis neces­sary fo r charging. 2) Transferring Magical Impulses (Commands) to a Target Person Without Tar­get's Knowledge in Order to Influence Him or Her By charging the gaze with a statement of intent or command (by making it the center of focus), the aura and chakras can be manipulated fo r healing purposes. However, this re-254 Introduction to Ritual Magic (VII) •"},{"pageNumber":264,"pageContent":"quires previous mastery of the gaze in order to work. We then enter a state of gnosis and transfer the command imaginatively and semiconsciously to the target person. This can even go so fa r as to implant an exploding glyph into a victim's aura. An exploding glyph is a sigil (designed either according to Spare's method or in any other way) that's de­signed to trigger a self-destruction mechanism in the target person. Figuratively speak­ing, it \"blows up>' the opponent's force field from the inside. Since most operations fo r magicaUy harming others are designed to attack the victim's immune system, the ex­ploding glyph should contain a corresponding command. The glyph is projected into the target person's aura where it's anchored and then activated or caused to self-acti­vate by discontinuation of the gaze and distraction (((banishing,'). This example points out once again how neutral the techniques of magic actually are, as the same gaze can either heal or make someone sick. 3) Disguising One,s Own State of Mind and Intentions \"Looks are deceiving,, or «the eyes are the mirror to the soul.,, If we want to effectively hide our moods and intentions from others, we need to be able to masterfully disguise our own eyes by feigning a deceptive expression (e.g., friendly instead of grim). This alone is enough fo r superficial contacts. However, if our opponent is particularly sensi­tive, the situation may require strict thought control so that the other person cannot \"tap,, our true intentions by means of telepathy. To do so, we recommend activating a dis­tracting and completely irrelevant train of thought that will act as an interfering trans­mitter. In particular, strong emotions such as fe ar, anger, or happiness are quite difficult to disguise without practice. The literal «poker fa ce, of a professional gambler is charac­terized not only by the complete control of fa cial expressions and fa ce muscles, but mainly by a rigid \"blocking\" expression that allows no insight into what's going on inside. This procedure could also be called an «armored gaze.t' The mastery of such techniques can be of significant use, for example during difficult business negotiations. 4) Perceiving Subtle Energies and Directing Them as well as for Clairvoyance Generally we use the 180° gaze fo r perceiving subtle energies, although some magicians prefer using the fixed magic gaze fo r this purpose. Yo u need to find out fo r yourself what works best fo r you. The goal here is the extension of your own range of perception for the purpose of manipulation or gazing into the future (with a magic mirror or crystal Introduction to Ritual Magic (VII) 255"},{"pageNumber":265,"pageContent":"ball, fo r example). Directing subtle energies, on the other hand, is almost always done in a fo cused state. Often the fixed gaze is used fo r perceiving subtle energies by turning off the psychological censor and creating a state of empty mind. Only when this is achieved should the magician switch to the 180° gaze. 5) Scanning Another Person in Order to Determine His or Her Strengths and Weaknesses The fixed gaze can also be of use fo r determining and diagnosing a situation (e.g., in healing operations, magical warfare, etc.) before beginning a magical operation. First we sweep over the entire aura of the person using the 180° gaze in order to get a general overview where his or her strengths and weaknesses are, then we apply the fixed gaze to recognize more details. But here, too, an ounce of practice is worth a ton of theory. Prac­tice scanning various things with your partner or any other person using both eye tech­niques and compare the results. 6) Extracting Energy or Information from a Target Person By using our eyes like absorbing sponges, we can manipulate the aura and chakras of our target person by tapping his or her subtle energies, even causing the target to weaken until (although quite rare) completely emptied of odic fo rce. But this technique can also be used fo r extracting undesired pathogenic energies, for exorcisms, or other similar purposes. Plus, we can also duplicate the conscious and unconscious informa .. tion stored in a target person and transfer it into our owri information memory. The technique of absorbing with the eyes as compared to using the palm of the hand or other tools such as crystals has the advantage of being less complicated and some­times even less noticeable. During an exorcism, an extremely rigid gaze is generally ap­plied that's fo cused directly into the eyes or onto the ajna chakra of the victim in order to break the resistance of his or her possession. The victim,s eyes usually begin to twitch when this is about to happen. This is also the moment when the undesired energy or being withdraws from the victim, which is usually accompanied by deep, jerky inhala­tion. Depending on the severity of possession, it may take several attempts that often re­quire weeks or even months of effort. 256 Introduction to Ritual Magic (VII)"},{"pageNumber":266,"pageContent":"All of these practices arc difficult to describe in detail and can only be hinted at. Our language is basically unsuitable fo r specifying such subjective procedures. But with the techniques that we've alluded to here along with your practice of mirror magic, you have enough information to try some experiments of your own. And don't ever fo rget that ultimately every magician develops his or her very own personal style of magic anyway. This book is designed primarily to help you aJong the way to finding your individual method of sorcery instead of trying to fo rce you into a rigid system of specific practices. Turn your eyes into control stations of power! Learn to play with your visual percep-. tion and see the spaces in between reality (and in between concrete objects as well) per­ceive things receptively and learn to actively emit looks of power. For example, you can practice by projecting self-tnade word or picture sigils onto a neutrally colored back­ground, either at home or in the company of other people. Experiments with animals are quite interesting as well since they often react quite sensitively to such eye techniques. 1. Just think about the caduceus or Hermes staff, or the staff of Asklepios. While Hermes is the psy­chopompos or guide of the souls in the Kingdom of the l)ead, Asklepios is the god of medicine and therefore of life. The staff also symbolizes kundalini, or the power of the snake, and the essence of sexu· ality and all of life itself. 2. This is a common reaction to such a magical influencing operation after the first spell has been broken. It's nothing more than the con1mon law of action and reaction or actio et reactio.

Only the simple can withstand the Sword. As we are below the Abyss, this weapon is then entirely destructive: it divides Satan against Satan. It is only in the lower fo rms of Magick, the purely human fo rms, that the Sword has become so important a weapon. A Dagger should be sufficient. But the mind of man is normally so important to him that the Sword is actually the largest of his 'Weapons; happy is he who can make the Dagger suffice! (Magick, p. 86). How should this be understood? Why does Crowley praise the magician who doesn,t need a sword, calling him or her happy? Lefs have a look at more of what he has to say first: 259"},{"pageNumber":269,"pageContent":"The Sword, necessary as it is to the beginner, is but a crude weapon. Its fu nction is to keep off the enemy or to fo rce a passage through them and though it must be wielded to gain admission to the palace, it cannot be worn at the marriage fe ast. One might say that the Pa ntacle is the bread of life , and the Sword the knife which cuts it up. One must have ideas, but one must criticize them. The Sword, too, is that weapon with which one strikes terror into the demons and dominates them. One must keep the Ego Lord of the Impressions. One must not allow the circle to be broken by the demon; one must not allow any one idea to carry one away. It will readily be seen how very elementary and fa lse all this is but fo r the begin-• • ner tt zs necessary. In all dealings with demons the point of the Sword is kep t downwards, and it should not be used fo r invocation, as is taught in certain schools of magick. If the Sword is raised to ·wa rds the Crown, it is no longer really a sword. The Crown cannot be divided. Certainly the Sword should not be lifted. The Sword may, however, be clasped in both hands, and kept steady and erect, symbolizing that thought has become one with the single aspiration, and burnt up like a fla me. Th is flame is the shin1, the Ruach A/him, not the mere Ruaclz Adam. The di­vine and not the human consciousness. The Magician cannot wield the Sword unless the Crown is on his head. Those Magicians, who have attempted to make the Sword the sole or even the principal weapon, have only destroyed themselves, not by the destruction of combina­tion, but by the destruction oj· division. 2 We akness overcomes strength. The mind must be broken up into a fo rm of insanity bef ore it can be transcended (ibid., p. 87f.). The sword is therefore a critical authority with its help, the magician can get a grip on one)s feelings that distort one)s perceptions and hide the nature of things. Needing to use it means being susceptible to the danger of self-deception and insa nity. Because if the instinctive confidence of the cup is injured, there will be dangerous discord within the magician. But the sword is also an instrument of thought control and preciseness, and it represents the scientific ideal and emotionally neutral objectivity. 260 Introduction to Ritual Magic (VIII)"},{"pageNumber":270,"pageContent":"Hence every idea must be analysed by the Sword. Hence, too, there must only be a sin­gle thought in the mind of the person meditating. One may now go on to consider the use of the Sword in purifying Emotions into Perceptions. It was the fu nction of the Cup to interpret the Perceptions by the Te ndencies; the Sword frees the Perceptions from the We b of Emotion. The Perceptions are meaningless in themselves; but the Emotions are worse, fo r they delude their victim into supposing them significant and true. Every Emotion is an obsession; the most horrible of blaspherrzies is to attribute any emotion to God in the Macrocosm, or to the pure soul in the Microcosm.[ ... ] Even in instruments themselves, their physical qualities, such as expansion and contraction (which may be called, in a way, the roots of pleasure and pain), cause error. Make a thermometer, and the glass is so excited by the necessary fusion that year by year, fo r thirty years aft erwards or more, the height of the mercury will continue to alter; how much more then with so plastic a matter as the mind! There is no emotion which does not leave a mark on the mind, and all marks are bad marks. Hope and fe ar are only opposite phases of a single emotion; both are incompatible with the pu­rity of the soul. With the passions of man the case is somewhat different, as they are functions of his own Will. They need to be disciplined, not to be suppressed. But emo­tion is impressed from without. It is an invasion of the Circle (ibid., pp. 90-92) Crowley's adn1onitions just like those of every shaman point out again and again that the mind should never be our master, but rather our servant. But this isn't meant to be derogatory. Even this servant has an important and even vital function because with­out it, the door would be wide open fo r self-deception, paranoia, and megalon1ania. The sword represents our guarantee against magical possession, which is why we need to apply at least the same amount of care in making and consecrating it as we would with all of our other weapons. The sword corresponds to the element of Air in its characteristics that represent thought, communication, language, and the ra tional mind. It can be of any shape or form. The handle is usually made of wood3 coated or set with copper, although solid copper is sometimes used as well. Introduction to Ritual Magic (VIII) 26 1"},{"pageNumber":271,"pageContent":"There is usuaUy a copper ball or disc at the pommel of the handle. The hilt is made of two crescent moons that represent its waxing and waning phases. In between these, round copper discs are attached.\" Together, the three discs or balls fo rm an equilateral triangle. Crowley mentions that some magicians make the three balls out of lead, pewter, and gold; the crescent moons would then be made of silver and the handJe filled with mercury> turning the sword into a symbol of the planets. But he also continues on to say that this is usually just a wild fantasy that's never fo llowed through with. The blade of the sword is usually made of stainless steel and should be straight and pointed, and sharp all the way to the hilt. If we look at the symbolism of the metal cor­respondences, it clearly tells us that this is a weapon that merges the principles of Mars and Venus. In this sense, Crowley wrote: Those two planets are Male and Female and thus reflect the Wa nd and the Cup, though in a much lower sense. The hilt is of Ve nus, fo r Love is the motive of this ruthless analysis if this were not so the sword would be a Black Magical weapon (p. 86). The magician etches or carves glyphs> symbols, or god-na mes into the blade. The sigil of a magical name could be used, fo r example, and Crowley suggests etching the formula AGLA by using vitriol oil.5 In the ritual techniques we teach in this book, the sword will onJy be used fo r evoca­tions, or demonic operations. But even in this case, it's always ((a weapon of last resort., Just imagine it in a practical sense. If the demon in the triangle threatens the stability of the circle, the sword (the intellect, or rational mind) is called fo r. It's not only used to drive back or \"destroy'' the demon if necessary, but if we think back on our model of paradigm shifting the magician can also use it as a last resort to prevent possible pos­session by immediately shifting to a paradigm of\"magic/disbelief, and declare the en­tire operation to be nothing but ((superstitious nonsense.\" Of course, such an operation not only has to be learned, but ifs also accompanied by a great deal of danger because it violates the magician's symbol-logic by practically voiding the entire magical operation, which could lead to serious negative conditioning every time one's in a state of trance. Reversing these effects can often take years, causing dry spells in which the magician 262 Introduction to Ritual Magic (VIII)"},{"pageNumber":272,"pageContent":"doesn't seem to succeed at any kind of magic at all, causing a sense of desperation that can easily take the upper hand on things. Strictly speaking, the sword should be used (without physical contact) before the op­eration since ifs also the embodiment of the intellectual capacity to make decisions and the n1agician makes decisions (e.g., to perform or not to perform a ritual) only after carefully thinking about them beforehand. Afterward, he or she acts uncompromisingly on the decision one has made. So here's the warning once again since it cannot be repeated often enough: The magician who never needs to use one's sword is well-off! With this, we recognize how deep the symbolism of ritual weapons goes, and with­out wanting to exaggerate it has hopefully become clear what we mean by saying that the magician creates one's own universe. ln doing so, it doesn't matter at all that he or she adapts a whole heap of symbolic material along the way because the number one rule is always that each n1agician's individual system of symbols needs to be coherent­in other words, the symbol-logic needs to be retained. That's why the relatively simple, coarse system of symbols that the beginner uses today is certainly much better than the blind imitation of some of the fa ncy techniques used in earlier times. In any case, we need to give life to the symbols themselves if they're to be of any use, and by giving them the breath of life, we ourselves become gods! THE CROWN AND THE HAT Although the crown is rarely used today, there was a time when it was considered to be an important tool, fo r example in the magic of the Golden Dawn as well as in all magic systems with a strong Egyptian influence. Even Crowley has dedicated two pages to the crown in his book Magick, and as we can see in his comments on the magic sword, he fe els that the crown is a prerequisite fo r using the sword. However, modern magic generally prefers to use the magic hat (sometimes named the '(wizard's cap))) instead, and its function resembles that of the crown. Crowley simply wrote: \"The Crown of the Magician represents the Attainment of his Work'' (ibid., p. 104). After that, he merely described various crowns and their symbol­ism. He basically recommends two types of crowns: • Introduction to Ritual Magic (VIII) 263"},{"pageNumber":273,"pageContent":"I) a crown with a band of pure gold with three pentagrams on the front (the middle one contains a diamond or opal) and a hexagram on the back, with the ureaus serpent entwined around it (a typicaJ symbol of sovereignty and initiation; 2) the classical Egyptian ateph crown ofThoth, the god of magic, thafs made of two ram's horns, one Jarge and three small sun-discs, large feathers, and a stylized lotus. A crimson cap is attached to the back of the gold band crown that fa lls to the shoulders. Since such crowns are rarely used today, as we already mentioned, this reference to Crowley's writings on the symbolism should be enough. The hat, on the other hand, is usually cone-shaped and therefore symbolizes the sub­tle energy fa lling down upon the magician as he or she's standing in one's circle (a \"power cone,', so to speak). lfs usually made of fe lt (supported by a wire frame), cotton, or even leather. Ifs often decorated with common magical symbols or the magician's personaJ sigil. Apart from their symbolic meanings, both the crown and the hat mainly serve the purpose of increasing the magician's sense of personal power and greatness. This is a psychological aid that supports and strengthens the magician's ability to assert his mag­ical will. Anyone who has ever worn a crown or a hat during a ritual will know what I'm talk­ing about. This head covering is a valuable tool to help the magician,s concentration and fo cus, although it requires a temple with a fa irly high ceiling since the hat can be quite tall sometimes. The suggested height of the magic hat is the measurement from the ma­gician,s belly button to the chin. Rulers, magicians, shamans, medicine people, and sorcerers of all cultures have al­ways worn some lcind of head covering; not only does it aid the state of trance, but the mere visual extension of the head always seems to impress any observers. If the crown or hat is not too heavy, yet still noticeable when worn, just the mere wearing of it will cause the magician to stand up straighter and stronger, giving more strength to the arm move­ments and allowing one to physically manifest that which is den1anded of him or her spiritually: preciseness, centeredness, and the fo cused will. In group rituals, usually onJy the ritual Jeader (e.g., the high priest or priestess) will wear a crown or hat as a sign of dignity and power. 264 Introduction to Ritual Magic (VIII)"},{"pageNumber":274,"pageContent":"Even though not having a crown or hat as part of your ritual utensils isn,t really con­sidered a drawback, you still might want to try out the feeling of wearing some kind of tall headgear (even if it's just provisional) in order for you to at least get an idea of the potential value of such tools. But in the end, ifs all a matter of personal preference any­way and we don)t want to make the mistake of overestimating its importance here. THE MAGIC NAME All around the world, it's a common practice fo r magicians to give themselves a magic name. Even monks and nuns take on such a name when embarking on their spiritual or monastic way of life. It represents both a new identity and the departure from one,s everyday personality. In magical groups and orders, it's also a means of retaining anonymity and preventing infiltration from outsiders. The magical name is usually received in trance, although it's sometimes calculated kabbalistically or it may symbolize a principle that the magician feels closely linked to, such as Aquarius or Therion, just to name a few. Mythological or historical role models are popular as namesakes as well, such as Merlin, Kundry, Parsifal, or Cassandra. In almost every case, the magical name represents the magician,s motto in life, and quite often the name is the motto itself. My own name is a good example of this: U.·. D.·. is the abbreviation for UBIQUE DIEMON UBIQUE DEUS (Latin fo r uthe demon is everywhere/in everything, the god is everywhere/in everything''). This represents my firm intention to always look at both sides of the coin and not always try to systematically cat­egorize everything into good and eviL Other examples are Crowley's name \"Perdurabo,, (Latin fo r ul will persevere',), or that of William Butler Yeats, who as a member of the Golden Dawn, assumed the name D.E.D.I. (Demon est deus inversus), which is Latin for ''A demon is a god turned upside down., Sometimes fa ntasy names that are received in trance are used as well. In these cases, the actual meaning of the name may not be revealed until much later, or the original meaning may fa de away with time and eventually be replaced by a new one. The addition of''Frater, (Latin fo r <'brother',) for males, or <'Soror,, (Latin fo r \"sister,) fo r females is especially common in magical groups and orders, and corresponds to the Christian monastic tradition. But th roughout the course of time, it has become com­monplace to use this addition (especially in literary works or written correspondence) Introduction to Ritual Magic (VIII) 265"},{"pageNumber":275,"pageContent":"even without belonging to an order since the terms ((Frater, and \"Soror, can also be un-d d (( d )) (( u )) erstoo as comra e or co· eague. By the way, numbers that are of certain significance (kabbalistic or otherwise) to the magician are often added to magic names as well (such as Abraxas 333). Luckily there are no rules fo r acquiring a magic name. Ifs even quite common to have more than one. For example, a person who belongs to a magical order may have a lodge name as weU as a personal one. Many magicians have another name as well that no other person knows and that's never revealed to another soul as long as the magician is alive. This represents the old magic belief that if a person,s (or god,s) \"true,, name is known, one holds the power over it. That's why the secret magical name represents the «last internal line of defense,\" or the place that protects one's identity a sort of spiritual • 1nner sanctum. In its function as a motto of life, the magical name is reflected in the lamen, or pen­tacle, which we'll be discussing in the next section. While the lamen represents the cur­rent state of the magician,s individual cosmos, or the present, the magical name sym­bolizes the future, or the goal that the magician is striving toward one's desired future. This kind of name can be a blessing and a curse at the same time. Once it's assumed and accepted, it will constantly remind the magician of what one still needs to do. This con­scious choosing of a name will become even clearer the less you,ve thought about the meaning of your real name that you received uby chance)) throughout the course of your life. Choosing a magical name can be a great, joyous moment of self-determination, but often it will become the first warning we receive. After all, while helping us maneuver around various psychonautic obstacles, it can serve as both a walking staff and a crutch. That's why the magician shouldn't just assume any old magical name without really thinking about it, nor should one drop the name without careful consideration. Of course, ifs quite common in magical tradition to document various levels of per­sonal development with the use of various names. The wide variety of magic names that AJeister Crowley used, fo r example, ranged from Perdurabo to V. V.V.V.V. to Baphomet, right up to his most fa mous name, To Mega Therion 666. On the other hand, a name is nothing more than a randomly chosen document of one,s stage of personal n1agical development.

Sometimes a magician may even choose a separate name for one single, usually long·term, n1agical operation that he or she may never use again. This can be compared to the costume or makeup of an actor, although it's also an expression of the emphasis of one certain aspect of one,s personality or actions. In other words, the magician specif­ically creates a certain personality for some specific task that lies ahead. In this sense, it couJd even be considered to be a sort of psychogon! But this is quite rare and is usually only done in magical warfare. Each magician needs to decide for oneself whether or when one should take on a magical name (or maybe even several) if one hasn't done so already. If you just can't come up with the right name using these methods, try incubating a dream designed to reveal the right name (sigil magic would be the best meth.od for doing so). This is the traditional way a shaman would do it. AJso think about whether you want other people to know your name or not after all, you,d be exposing a very intimate part of your per­sonality and that requires mutual trust. INTRODUCTION TO THE PAN RITUAL Here we,d like to ma ke a suggestion on one possible way to perform a Pan ritual; the rit­ual given here has been used by various magicians a nun1ber of times. The Gr eek figure Pan has alw ays played a large role throughout the history of Euro­pean magic. The meaning of his name is unclear; some believe its origins derive from the Sanskrit language, while others think ies just a babbled word like ('mommy,, or \"daddy., Not until much later did the word \"Pan,, receive the meaning ((all, everything', that's still connected with it today (in its interpretation as \"whole,), and is reflected in modern words such as ('pan-Arabic friendship,,, \"pansexuality,\" or even \"panorama, (''whole view,). Pan as an omnipotent god wasn't mentioned until Nero's time. Pan was thought to be the son of Zeus and a nymph. Right from the day of his birth, his entire body was covered with hair, and he had the horns and legs of a goat. Accord­ing to tradition, he hunts the nymph named Syrinx who begs her sisters (or the Earth Mother, Gaia .. in other versions) to change her into reed. Saddened, Pan sinks down into the reed and a lamenting sound rings out. He cuts a few pieces of various lengths and binds them together with wax, making the shepherd's pipe or pan flute. He later loses Introduction to Ritual Magic (VIII) 267"},{"pageNumber":277,"pageContent":"this flute and makes a new one out of reeds so that he can play at Dionysos' spring fe sti­val. He even challenges Apollo to a musical competition, but loses. Pan made his home in Arcadia. He was a typical god of shepherds and goats and was worshiped fo r his fe rtility he would <'mount, one goat to make the whole herd fe rtile. But even in early times, he was considered to be at least part human, and therefore did­n't have the pure fo rm of an animaJ. He can scare man and animal by suddenly appearing, fo r example while they,re rest­ing in the midday heat, but he's also playful and enjoys making jokes and drinking wine.(· Pan is in no way just after all the beautiful nymphs he even likes little boys and even in early times he was considered the epitome of sexuality as such. Pindar mentions him as a companion of the Great Mother, which is reflected in modern-day witchcraft and Wicca where he's honored as the \"Horned One, or ((Great God.,, He appears in many shapes and fo rn1s and was later merged or equated with other deities such as Dionysos, although his lineage is a bit confusing as well. He's also related to the Roman Fanus, just as Saturn and Faune are often viewed as embodiments of Pan. It was Christianity that made a devil out of Pan and equated him with the Bible)s Satan. This is a clear sign of the demonization of pre-Christian heathenism, and soon afterward images of the devil were automatically given the features of a goat. In this sense, Pan is often merged with Saturn, whereby older Egyptian elements probably played a role as well (Set Satan Saturn). As the herald of physical sensuality, Pan be­came the reincarnation of evil to Christianity since this religion preaches the hatred of one,s own body. Concerning Pan,s kabbalistic correspondences, I'd like to quote here and in the fo llowing some of the passages fr om my Ve rsuch iiber Pan ('< Essay on Pan,\" see Bibliography at the end of this chapter): In his book LIBER 777, Aleister Crowley assigns the numbers 0 and 13 to Pa n which I fe el is quite correct. Omnipotent god and devil in one what a tremendous step well beyond the awkward dualism of Zoroastrian and Manichaeus systems not to men­tion that of Christianity, Mosaism and Islam! With this, Master Therion naturally fo l­lows the best of syncretic and gnostic tradition. 268 Introduction to Ritual Magic (VIII)"},{"pageNumber":278,"pageContent":"The word (\\panic\" is derived from this deity as well because Pan is not just generous and kind, he can also cause horror and fe ar, especially to those who have sexual and vir­ile inhibitions. This brings us to his magicaJ functions, and these are quite varied: Pan appears to some as nature personified that could be categorized as spring and the ecstasy of awakening; others, on the other hand, see in him the abyss of existence, the principle of totality, ecstasy and even death. After all, there's a good reason why Pa n corresponds to the planet Saturn (in LIBER 777 and other sources), which also carried the stigma of being \"devilish\" fo r quite some time. For me personally, Pan is the ultimate symbol of ecstasy namely the ecstasy that's expressed in the merging of the mystic with his god, as well as in the thundering dance of· creation, the cycle of life , death and rebirth, and in the rapture of the spirit and the senses. Pa n is the ONE and ALL. In this sense, he has qualities similar to those of CHAOS, even though he more strongly embodies its more creative, ecstatic aspect. When called and if he comes, Pan almost always brings something luxuriant along with him, but also something sudden and excessive: Pan just loves giving someone that one extra scoop of soup in the bowl that makes it overflow, or overfilling the glass until it spills and being able to deal with that is one of· the most important prerequisites fo r magically working with the Pa n principle. When he comes, he comes all the way. A fr iend of mine once told me that he always made new fr iends after a Pa n ritual in fa ct, he made so many new fr iends that it just got to be too much. So whoever asks Pa n fo r something specific (although he'll gladly stop by during a ritual 'just to say hello'') should keep in mind that he can be a rea l joker sometimes who likes to tease and play tricks on his servants. Magicians without a sense of humor wouldn't stand a chance with him, and he'd turn their life into hell which brings us right back to the subject of the devil. Of course, Pan is also sensual pleasure and ecstasy, so that he particularly likes to show up when his fe stivals have an orgiastic nature. That's when he breaks all bounds[ . . . ], because the On.e and All won't let himself be imprisoned in our tiny little nutshell of ideas and structure. I highly recommend this method to whomever wants to really find out in a theurgic way what boundless ness and panic[ ... ] can be like. Pa n is ''devilish\" Introduction to Ritual Magic (VIII) 269"},{"pageNumber":279,"pageContent":"in the way that he terminates old, well-loved, routine opinions he separa tes us from our illusion and leads us to a new ecstatic unity. In the process, it's possible that some fe athers might be shed, but once you let yo urself get caught up in the unleashed cur-rent, you'll soon realize that the things you had to discard along the way were nothing but a burden anyway. Pa n is a god that will allow you to have as much an insight into his principles as you can handle. Although he'll gladly give you one more ounce on top of that, my ex­perience has shown that this is usually a mere quantitative figure. In this sense de­spite all the racing around he's actually a mild god, and a mischievous comrade who will not obey any rules. So if you, d like to try your hand at the Pan principle, alone or in a group, fe el free to do so. Pan can probably sweeten up your magic more than any other god since he's the epitome of cheerfulness. Magically and therapeutically speaking, he can rid you of any type of sexual problem ra nging from impotence to frigidity, and he can help fight de­pression and increase your zest fo r life, revive your spirits, or help you obtain a lover­or a sexual partner, to be more specific. After a Pan ritual, you should pay close attention to any changes in your life, such as omens in your everyday routine, new acquaintances, and so on. Pa n often gives his friends some kind of identifying sign to use if they want to contact him again: perhaps a melody, or a certain word or gesture, etc. Of course, this sign should always be used in the fu ture any time you want to contact Pan. This can even be done mentally in everyday situations (in the car, the subway, at work practically everywhere). \"The more the merrier\" you'll certainly know when you've had enough. Or at least Pa n will make sure you do ... But seriously, once you've truly had enough of Pan's effects, just let them fa de away and of course avoid any social events fo r awhile. Since Pa n is humanitarian (although not necessarily in the sense of the Red Cross or Salvation Army}, he>ll (almost) never fo rce himself on you unless you ask. 270 Introduction to Ritual Magic (VIII)"},{"pageNumber":280,"pageContent":"THE RITUAL STRUCTURE We start with an introductory protection and banishing ritual, fo Uowed by a short med­itation; then music is played, preferably by the magicians or participants themselves.

Which is why we'll just give you a few tips here to help those of you who aren't aU that fa miliar with the Kabbalah yet. The Hebrew word �ASH means ((creation,\" and its numerical value is 370. In 777, Crowley writes the fo llowing about this number: ((The Sabbatic Goat in his highest as­pect. This shows the whole of Creation as matter and spirit. The materia) 3, the spiritual 7, and all cancelling to Zero.'> That's why we have the phrase ((pneumatic Capricorn,, (from the Greek pneuma, «spirit,). Therefore ifs a logical conclusion to connect this goat aspect of transcendence with the principle of Pan. REPORTS FROM MAGICAL PRACTICE (11) This tin1e we'd like to illustrate two magical operations where some common problems occurred that could easily happen again in everyday situations. Two magicians, P. and W., had an ongoing dispute with their landlord that seemingly never wanted to end. They lived together in a secluded house in the woods and their landlord terrorized them constantly; one morning they even fo und him standing unan­nounced in the living room holding an electric drill! Even after threatening to take legal action didn,t help one bit, the magicians fe lt com­pelled to turn to stronger means. They created a psychogon to curse the landlord and make him leave them aJone. In doing so, they used the technique of imagospurius as de­scribed by Bardon that we,ll discuss later. The operation took an entire month. Every evening they charged the psychogon fo r two hours and then let it loose on their victim. A fe w days after the operation was over, the landlord's small child was run over by a car, seriously injured, and later died. The problems stopped after that, but P. and W. de­cided to give up the house and move to a more comfortable place. Even today, the two are still tormented by a bad conscience. For quite a long ti me, they were uninterested in any kind of magical warfare whatsoever (even, as in this case, in self-defense). Basically, this is a real good example of the ((magical ricochet'' that often causes big problems in magical warfare and other operations intended at hurting or killing some­one. The magician attacks a certain target person but someone else who's close to the 278 Introduction to Ritual Magic (VIII)"},{"pageNumber":288,"pageContent":"target person gets hit full fo rce instead. Usually it hits relatives or lovers, but can even hit colleagues or neighbors too. How can this happen? There arc several possible explanations that we,d like to take a closer look at. First of all, we,ll most likely think of the symbol-logical fu zzy relation that we discussed earlier on. The precision of the symbols that we work with in magic is not the same as we know and expect fro m science. It's common knowledge that especially in magical warfa re ifs often quite difficult to find just the right dosage of fo rce to carry out an attack and apply it accurately to the target. It's not uncommon fo r a magician to hit a seemingly ((inno­cenf' third person instead of the intended target. But this doesn,t automatically have to be considered a ((failure.'> The Joss of his child possibly affected the landlord much more than if he were to fa ll ill himself, or possibly even die (which the magicians surely didn't intend). In any case, what remains is the undeniable fa ct that the magicians hit a person that they didn't consciously intend to hit. At best, this was \"success on another lever' a phenomena that can be observed again and again in magic. Another explanation could be that the target person was protected so well that everything bounced right off him, hitting his child instead. Such cases are common as well. If you've ever tried to magically influence a drunk person, or someone who's ex­tremely down to earth, or simply insensitive or extremely skeptic when it comes to magic, then you'll know how hard it can be. This is called ''the hardening of the aura,, which often happens entirely unintentionally. In such cases, the energy of the attack is automatically deflected, especially when the target person is in the best of health. Or, sometimes, it can even be unconsciously thrown back at the attacker. Most n1agicians fo rget to test the hardness of the target person's aura before initiat­ing an attack. When in doubt, the magician can always perform an operation to soften the aura (e.g., by implanting an exploding glyph) before proceeding with the actual at­tack. However, such operations known as «acidic magic'' req uire superbly trained skills in magical energy perception the mirror magic is especially well su ited fo r this. But it's also possible that the actual cause of fa ilure lies with the magician. Whoever re­acts on a psychological weakness instead of proceeding with a clear head usually lacks the necessary precision. By the way, I think this is the most likely explanation in this case. The magicians, anger didn't just take place during the ritual; that's just where it was concen­trated. The commandment of((nonattaclunent/nonlack of interest\" was broken repeatedly, Introduction to Ritual Magic (VIII) 279"},{"pageNumber":289,"pageContent":"which probably affected the quality of the magical operation right from the start. Whoever considers the opponent to be superior fo r any length of time starts fighting with one's back up against the wall, making him or her weak and his or her opponent strong. Yo u can compare it to a desperate teenaged boy wildly lashing out at everything around him. He builds up such an enormous amount of fo rce that son1etimes half a dozen strong, full-grown men are needed to tame the raging youth; but he's rarely accu­rate since he wastes most of his energy on unintentionally smashing up completely harmless objects or people instead of focusing on his real opponent. His coordination is impaired as well. However, he's still dangerous due to the amount of force he releases and his unpredictability. And in the same way such a furious person can accidentally hit an innocent bystander, a magician who can't control one's own anger can miss his or her target just as easily. Of course, the fo rce of anger shouldn't be underestimated, and it can be splendidly used fo r a magical operation, but it has to be controlled in a state of trance, for example and it's imperative that it be thoroughly banished afterward. Finally, we need to mention the technique of thought control that's absolutely neces­sary for any kind of magical attack, or any kind of concentrative magical work in gen­eral. Because if the magician,s thoughts wander even fo r a split second while directing this kind of energy, the powers can quickly develop a mind of their own, and that can have unpredictable consequences. The following operation was a bit more accurate. Married magicians T. and C. had difficulties ·with their landlord as well, who also happened to live in the same house. By the time the two finally magically intervened, the whole situation had escalated to such a degree that the first operation had no effect at all. They finally chose the path of least resistance and decided to move out. But since a legal dispute was imn1inent, they left be­hind several exploding glyphs and a curse fe tish made of parchment that were well hid­den in various spots in the house. These were concealed in the floorboards and walls and remained unnoticed when the couple moved out. During the court hearing that took place later on, the landlord who was also the plaintiff suddenly broke down and started to cry, \"These people ruined us. Since they moved out, we can't find anyone else to rent the apartment. My wife is in psychiatric care and I feel like I'm on the brink of death myself.,, This didn't bother our two magi­cians one bit, even though the landJords attempted to defame their character in the face of their new landlord and practiced nightly telephone harrassment. The legal accusa-280 Introduction to Ritual Magic (VIII)"},{"pageNumber":290,"pageContent":"tions were entirely unfounded, which I was able to convince myself of as well. On mov­ing day, the landlord and his fa mily even got physically violent without being provoked in any way, until the police were finally called. This is a case of successful magical revenge. Regardless of what you think about such kinds of operations, they're a good example of the subtle and lasting effects that magic can have. It's also typical that the actual success took place after the magician couple moved out. It physically fulfilled the requirement of<'nonattachment,', which surely gave the mag­ical operation a push start. The failure of the first atten1pts (one of which I participated in myself) can be explained as-in the first example with the fa ct that the magicians were too involved in the situation and lacked the inner peace and centralization required. This is why I highly recommend every magician to magically protect one,s abode from undesired disturbances right from the day he or she moves in, even though there may be no immediate danger. In an emergency, the magician can then build up on this existing fo rm of protection instead of having to dig up lines of defense at the last minute. \"De-oding, (or removing od from) the apartment by dowsing it in incense and performing an appropriate ritual, possibly supported by an operation of sigil magic, will prevent or deflect the worst. In the case of an actual threat, you can mentally cast a pro­tective circle, such as a belt of light, around the whole property. This is also recom­mended to protect against theft and fire and can be done mentally as you,re leaving the residence. But in doing so, don,t fo rget the laws of symbol-logic: When you return home from work and break through the circle as you enter the dwelling, you,ll naturally have to cast a new one. PRACTICAL EXERCISES EXERCISEJ3 THE MAGIC GAZE (111) If you've already practiced the tratak exercise for three months, you can now combine it with the magic gaze by using the eye fixation chart from the last section. Now the idea is to alternate practicing the 180° gaze and the magic gaze. (This is a combination of Exercises 26 and 32.) Alternate using the two gazes every few minutes and change a bit faster each time you practice until finally you,re able to switch every fifteen or even five Introduction to Ritual Magic (VIII) 281"},{"pageNumber":291,"pageContent":"seconds. At first, don't practice fo r more than six to eight minutes at a time later you can even shorten the practice sessions. By the way, this is also an extremely good eye exercise. EXERCISE 34 THE MAGIC GAZE (IV): GAZE PROJECTION Take an everyday object made of metal (such as a spoon, a ring, or similar object) and stare at it using the 180° gaze. Try determining its temperature by gazing at it. (Of course, this is a subjective temperature that can't be measured in degrees!) Once you,ve done this to your satisfaction, use the fo cused magic gaze to project heat into the object, first on to its surface, then a bit deeper, and finally deep into its core. Make it get hotter and hot­ter and stop when you fe el you've reached your goal. Practice this exercise at least 500 times(!) without actually checking to see if the object's temperature has changed. This rule is extremely impor­tant. If you want to ach ieve such physical results, you have to release your­self from all pressure to succeed. So just leave the object alone fo r awhile after the exercise to let it cool off before touching it again or continuing. EXERCISE35 THE MAGIC GAZE (v): CHARGING VIA GAZE PROJECTION Later on, after you,ve practiced the previous exercise at least 100 times, you can practice the charging of normal tap water (not carbonated min­eral water). Place a glass of water on the table in front of you, take a sip, have a quick look at its aura and overall state with the defocused 180° gaze, and then switch to the fo cused magic gaze. Try looking right into the ('core, of the water. Then taste the water again and see if you notice any change in taste. Experiment with and without special imagination tech­niques often all you have to do is gaze at the water intensely enough to cause a change in its taste. Therefore it won't be necessary to project any 282 Introduction to Ritual Magic (VIII)"},{"pageNumber":292,"pageContent":"kind of command into the water to make it change its taste. When you're all done, try turning the taste back to its original by using the same method. Yo u can practice this exercise with one or more partners. For example, take two glasses of water and use your gaze to charge one of them while your partners wait outside. When you,re done, they should try to deter­mine which of the two glasses you charged by tasting it. Don,t try this) though, until you've practiced enough on yo ur own. EXERCISE 36 WORKING WITH THE PAN PRINCIPLE Whenever you like, perform the above Pan ritual either alone or with oth­ers. Yo u can even do it when you're not fe eling all that well since Pan is the ultimate symbol of vitality. Experiment with the Pan principle during various seasons of the year. What does this god fe el like in the spring, summer, fa ll, and winter? Do you prefer performing Pan rituals outdoors, at home in your temple, or maybe even in a cave? Yo u don,t need any special occasion to ·perform a Pan ritual -do it if you just want to see him again, or are simply curious, or even if you're not quite sure of your intentions yet. However, avoid con­straining Pan in any way once he,s inside of you, let him run his full course. Quite often you'll be sexually excited after such a ritual, which is why it's not a bad idea to perform it with your partner.

The supporters of this type of money-making, however, claim that although knowl­edge and wisdom may be free (which is a thought that just might not occur to every­one), this in no way applies to its transfer and that Enlightened Ones have to earn their bread and butter too ... Surely there are plenty of magicians who are just interested in making a fa st buck and won't even lift a finger until they're paid in gold (or at least silver) in advance, and there arc a number of naive ones as well who think that everything should be free nowa­days in this New Age, the Age of Aquarius. Now ifs certainly no surprise that everyone in the New Age and magic scenes seems to be getting itchy about money this subject has occupied humanity since day one of their existence. After aU, even the earliest soci­eties that traded and bartered probably showed signs of commercialism as weU. It's pretty clear that the roots of money usually lie in contempt, and to most people ifs the ultimate symbol of n1aterialism. Cultures such as the Indian, with its inherent ha­tred of the here and now, and the Christian, with its late Egyptian cult of the afterlife, can hardly tolerate the fa ct that the n1asses go about the task of n1aking money with such pleasure instead of piously looking toward heaven or moksha which certainly never stopped the priest castes of all times from readily taking advantage of the privilege of hoarding money either. \"Give me the money, ifll onJy make you rotten,, said Lupo to lupinchen, two German comic figures, and these words accurately reflect the opinion of most religious hierarchies when it comes to their often quite pecuniary believers. How on earth could something as useful and migratory as money make you rotten? Of course, it can be addictive just like many other conveniences in life, and it's no coin­cidence that the same ki�nd of people tend to vehemently curse alcohol, sex, and all other pleasures as well. And those who control money-making also control the lives of the masses themselves, at least fo r the most part. Even today, radical Islamic banks are pro­hibited from charging or paying interest (the sheiks often turn to cleverly designed co­operative models fo r the distribution of profit and loss), and in the Christian Middle Ages, only Jews were allowed to do pure business with money (especially lending on in­terest), fo r which they were sometimes even stoned nonetheless this was, by the way, 286 Introduction to Money Magic (I)"},{"pageNumber":296,"pageContent":"one of the main causes fo r the start of European anti-Semitism. This could also be called an exercise in the \"systematic cultivation of scapegoats,\" and one that was even encour­aged by the New Testament, as the supposedly mild youth of Nazareth was suddenly not so innocent when he chased the money-changers out of the temple a gesture that thrilled the hearts of Marxists everywhere. This leads us to another contemptuous ideology toward money. When it comes to private ownership and making money, socialism and communism (at least in theory) often behave quite similar to the past mendicant orders of the Albigens era. By the way, the more you study this subject in detail, the more surprised you'll be to discover how much energy is put into rejecting something (at least pro fo rma) that none of us could do without, and as al ready mentio ned that has enormous practical value. Or, as Douglas Adams says so well about our planet in his fa mous novel, The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy: \"Most of the people on it were unhappy fo r pretty much of the time. Many solutions were suggested to this problem, but most of these were concerned with the movements of small green pieces of paper, which is odd because on the whole it wasn't the small green pieces of paper that were unhappy.\" How true, how true! Lefs have a look at this problem from another point of view by using the symbolism of the tarot as an example. Today iCs generally common to allocate the pentacles (still often referred to and depicted as coins) to the element of Earth, probably because money (if we stick to the ancient analogy ''pentacles/coins\" instead of the euphemistic term ((discs,) was considered the epitome of material property. But strangely this is a de­velopment that didn,t occur until the nineteenth century, during a time in which \"prop­erty', was associated more and more (and almost exclusively) with ((real estate.'' Back then as in other times as well, the merchant risked dealing with movable C<airy\") goods, but made sure to quickly '' i nvest\" profits in static (\"earthy,) valuables such as property, buildings, and entire estates. But oddly enough, in the same century we can find a much older interpretation that allocates the coins to the clement of Air, namely by no one less than Papus in his Ta rot of the Bohemians! Personally, I can understand this allocation2 much better fo r several reasons. First of all, money is essentially moveable it thrives off the fa ct that it's transferred from one place to another and from owner to owner. Only then can it truly fulfill its purpose, which is why it seems absurd to want to hoard it. (In economically more stable times, banks hoarded significantly less cash and much more Introduction to Money Magic (I) 287"},{"pageNumber":297,"pageContent":"precious metals and property!) The merchant is principally of Mercurial (\"airy,,) nature: He or she thrives off of transportation, communication, and mobility, and takes advan­tage of the surplus at one location and the demand at another by skillfully maintaining a balance (the Libra principle) between the two, although only temporarily. This is ex­actly the function that money has. The second reason that supports the allocation of \"coins,, to ((air,, is the fa ct that money is an abstract concept (principle of Air) of the first degree. It's not edible and has no other purpose than to refer to other nonmonetary valuesJ or act as a mediator (Mer­cury/Hermes= messenger of the gods). The third reason naturally seems to be the most important to me because it directly touches on the psychology of n1oney. By categorizing money in the element of Air and viewing it as something nonstatic, it loses a great part of its threatening nature unless of course you're still crawling around in ontological diapers, scratching your head, and lamenting over the fa ct that change is the only thing thafs certain in this world. But who on earth is capable of both understanding money as something light-footed and ephemeral, but also appreciating it when one doesn,t have it? In my opinion, being stuck in financial difficulties (which I have been in many times!) is the perfect time to take the first step and start viewing money as a toy or the cosmic expression of the dance of cre­ation, the embodiment of the continuously changing and alternating energies of yin and yang, of light and darkness, and so on. Now what does this all have to do with magic? Quite a bit, I think. Not just because magicians are pestered with financial problems sometimes too. (Interestingly enough� this seems to be the rule. Magicians who are rich in money and material goods are the absolute exception. Maybe they find their way to magic as a result of financial difficulties in the first place in the hopes of being able to resolve them by these means. Who knows?) Ifs probably more likely that these magicians (who reaJly should know better) have been affected by the negative connotations surrounding \"the multiplication of our currency, just as well, and have developed an incredibly bad conscience when it comes to money magic. And that can have devastating consequences in practice. Many of my coUeagues (myself included) have either had no luck whatsoever in money magic operations, or they resulted in just the exact opposite, or \"success on an­other level,, which ru explain shortly. 288 Introduction to Money Magic (I) •"},{"pageNumber":298,"pageContent":"There's not all that much to say when a magical operation fa ils entirely. There are too many fa ctors that could have played a role, including those that I'll discuss later on. If the magician ach ieves \"negative success,,, on the other hand, the whole thing becomes clearer. Aleister Crowley referred to this phenomena in his internal O.T.O. documents relating to sex magic. Here,s a general paraphrasing. A magician conjures up a spell to get ahold of, say, $5,000 and three days later she causes an accident that costs exactly this amount; or the sheriff unexpectedly knocks on the door (maybe even unjustly, which would be relatively harmless, e.g., if the local tax office mixes up your taxpayer's account number) and kindly asks fo r the five grand or else he'll let his underlings loose to watch over your every move. This has happened to plenty of magicians and not just in con­nection with sex magic (which is why I fe el this phenomena can't just be ascribed to this discipline) they often ((received'' exactly the specified amount, just with a minus sign instead of a plus sign in front of the sun1. As the saying goes, you could \"hear God laughing.'' And just like any joke made at our expense, it takes a great deal of distance and self-irony to be able to laugh right along with God an excellent technique that I can't stress enough, fo r psychological as weU as magical reasons. (Don't fo rget: ((Laugh­ter banishes!,) Psychologists, as clever as they are, have a nice explanation fo r such ex­periences as long as they,re willing to draw an analogous, causal relationship between ritual and negative success in the first place, such as \"Repressed fe elings of guilt and be­havioral patterns of self-punishment could have reversed the intended statement of in­tent., Ifs hard to find arguments against this because by denying it (\"No, I don't!''), psy­choanalysis pulls its standard trick out of the bag and says, '<Oh no? You sure do! They're unconscious!', And since by definition alone there's no possible way to make any con­scious statements about the subconscious, at least not directly, the buck is passed right back to you. Nonetheless, I don't want to deny the fa ct that this explanation may hold some truth; at least it seems to be a plausible explanation when such instances happen quite frequently, and it might make the magician take a good look at his or her overaU relationship with money. However, the third possibility gets really interesting «success on another level.\" This phenomena occurs quite often and I could list a zillion true stories from my own prac­tice and that of magician friends, but one example should be enough. A fe w years ago, I was in financial trouble up to my neck so bad that I had no idea how I'd survive the next Introduction to Money Magic (I) 289 •"},{"pageNumber":299,"pageContent":"month. I decided to take a trip into the Earth tattwa (still the analogy of \"money = earth,) and received a ritual from the ('authorities, there that I was to perform over a pe­riod of several days. (Such information could be called a ((revelation,,, ''announcement,\" or '<message from the subconscious,\" but that's unimportant here.) Instead of winning the lottery or receiving unlikely gifts of money, I received five job assignments all at once just a fe w days before completing the ritual, and all were extremely urgent. Since I couJdn,t afford turning down even one of them (and fo llow-up assignments were fo re­seen as well), I had to work sixteen hours a day fo r several weeks until I was thoroughly wiped out, although I at least didn't have to starve. That was the \"Earth, I asked fo r! But there are plenty of other variations of ((success on another level,,, such as the fa ct that even after many years of practice, many magicians often find it disproportionately easier to conjure up tangible objects and valuables instead of the cash that would be nec­essary to buy them. In this sense, a fr iend of mine needed a bicycle but didn't have the money to buy one. Shortly after the money ritual, son1eone just \"happened, to give him a bike .... So whoever has trouble conjuring up cash should try this method instead, and it just happens to take a considerable amount of the strain off your nerves as well. Principally, it doesn,t reaiJy matter what technique you use fo r money magic. Sigil magic has proven to be quite effective, but planetary magic works just as well. For the latter, I'd recommend first doing a Jupiter ritual to \"create the general mood, (although Jupiter is responsible fo r wealth and abundance, it usually expresses itself in bountiful luxuries such as champagne by the cartload or buckets full of caviar, and not really in lottery winnings or cash) before targeting a specific action with Mercury. If you want to give the whole thing a bit more stability and permanence, you can top it off with a Sat­urn ritual. Traveling into the tat twa spheres (which is basically a primeval shamanic technique) generally works quite well, too, as long as you ask to receive a ritual that you can perform on a physical level since this will, in a sense, anchor the operation in the material world. (After all, whafs the use of a silly astral dollar?) Sex magic is excellently suited fo r money magic operations as well if that happens to be your taste. Once you've completed your money magic operation, it's a good idea to open a few channels so that the money can actually flow and find its way to you, fo r example by going against your habits and playing the lottery or making wild bets, and so on. On the other hand, even though this principle of opening channels is theoretically correct, I ac-290 Introduction to Money Magic (I)"},{"pageNumber":300,"pageContent":"tually don,t recommend gambling or playing the lottery in this connection because it makes fo rgetting the operation (one of the most important prerequisites fo r success ac­cording to Austin Osman Spare) quite difficult. Whether you want to admit it or not­once you,ve got that lottery ticket in your hand, you'll get more nervous with every day as the drawing gets closer. ft would probably be a better idea to just keep your eyes open and take advantage of any opportunities you might have to win something, to do busi­ness, and the like. Casinos can truly be heU if you,re not fa miliar with the atmosphere there. Let's take the example of roulette. If we want to take a magical approach, there are plenty of ques­tions that will arise: ShouJd we try influencing the bail's moven1ent (telekinesis), or try guessing/foreseeing the upcoming number, color, and so on (which, by the way, applies to all kinds of ga mbling). Most people will fi nd it more difficult to do the fo rmer than the latter, but there are certainly no fixed rules fo r this. But even the roulette magician should take one thing to heart: Good gamblers and most certainly pros never play more than twenty minutes a day because they can.,t maintain the necessary disassocia­tion trance fo r much longer than that. And if you risk $50 and end up with $55 a half an hour later, don,t turn up your nose at this! Where else can you walk off with I 0 percent interest in such a short period of time (with a real winning chance of 48 percent)? The fa ct that ifs usually easier to conjure up objects or work or the like instead of cash and inheritance money may have to do with the fa ct that our subconscious (which is responsible fo r magic according to the psychological model) doesn't know how to deal with abstract concepts such as money, but is much more interested in getting lots of col­orful objects, just like a child would be. After aU, the likelihood that someone else around you wants a bicycle at the same time is much less than would be the case with money, so that the energy image of\"bicycle, can find its way more easily and start mov­ing like a taxi right toward the person who waves at it. We're not doing ourselves as magicians any fa vor by putting too much importance on it. The truly deciding fa ctor in money magic is our attitude toward money itself and the way we handle it. In my opinion, it's much more effective and certainly more healthy to approach the subject of money magic in a playful manner, fo r ex ample by stroking a large doUar bill every day and whispering with a sly smile (4GO and get your fricndsr' instead of stiffly casting the circle and desperately trying to evoke a demon into the triangle with the Introduction to Money Magic (I) 291"},{"pageNumber":301,"pageContent":"hopes of him eventually sending a little cash your way.

Ike once put it so well: '(If you Jove money, it wi1llove you.,, Let's take a look at it in a personified sense as the shamans would do. Why would a creature named ((Money, appear to a per­son who actually hates and despises it deep down inside? If we were in that position, would we do it if we had a choice? And money does have a choice, believe me! The doors are open to money day and night, and everywhere it's welcomed and cherished with war1n hearts and spent again. Back in the days as a college student, I got in the habit of giving the biggest tips when I had the least money. And I have to admit that this kind of money magic was more effective than any attempt to acquire it by fo rce or hoard it. Money is airy and playful; ifs not happy when it's locked up in musty dungeons and silly piggy banks, and it will take the next convenient or (usually) inconvenient oppor­tunity to get the hell out just like we wouJd do! Money wants to have fun, just like every good entertainment artist does too. And if we allow it to have its fun, such as by decorating the altar during a Mercury ritual with stuffe d wallets and colorful ban.knotes from all over the world, or by stroking and ca­ressing it but also by giving it its freedom without hesitation when it wants to leave, then, and only then will it stop controlling us when we don't have it, or enslaving us and making us dependent on its materialistic aspect (which it most certainly has). This cer­tainly is true. Money itself doesn't stink, but it can make everything else stink. But as al­ready mentioned, don,t overestimate it! It's the lifeblood in our economical veins and it always was; it's necessary fo r life but it's merely one necessary part among many others. It would be silly to pretend that blood is the most important of all. Without a heart (as a motor) and the liver or kidneys (for cleansing), blood wouJd stop flowing, thicken, and clot, eventually clogging the veins and clogging life itself. And that's exactly what the money magician should take to heart: Money is motion and needs air because it's the embodiment of air itselfl Being rich n1eans ((having riches>' and that doesn,t necessarily have to do with money, even though it can be a magnificent indicator of our personal 1nagical success.

In such texts, these two tools are often confused with one another or merged into one, but we,U be discussing each of these magical weapons ind ividually in the traditional sense. For now, it doesn't matter why contemporary authors just mention the pentacle since they don't state the reason themselves either. Let's just keep in mind that the older magical tradition (starting with Crowley and before) makes a clear distinction between the pen­tacle and the lamen, which is no longer the case today with all authors. In this section, we'll just be dealing with the pentacle, but the lamen will be discussed later. The pentacle is the fo urth and last elemental weapon that we'JI be discussing. As the wand is to Fire, the cup to Water, and the sword to Air, the pentacle is associated with the element of Earth.' Once again, Crowley's statements on the pentacle (or ''pantacle\") summarize it best: • As the Magick Cup is the heavenly fo od of the Magus> so is the Magick Pa ntacle his ea rthly fo od.

Crowley's reference to the pentacle needing to be made of pure wax (beeswax ) and exactly \"eight inches in diameter, and in thickness half an inch, is rarely heeded today. Nowadays plenty of other materials are used, ranging from metal to clay, and stone to wood. That was surely the case in the past as well.

Not because it poses a technical problem in actually making it, because just the opposite is true.

No, making the pentacle also re quires a fine sense of personal symbolism, but above all it requires that the magician thoroughly understands the depths of one,s own soul. And the pentacle is surely not a static magical weapon. On the contra ry, it's an ex­tremely dynamic, versatile weapon that's a document of our entire life. Th is Pa ntacle therefo re represents all that we are, the resultant of all that we had a tendency to be. f ... 1 The Pa ntacle is then in a sense identical with the karma or kamma of the Magi-• ctan. The Ka rma of · a man is his ledger. Th e balance has not been struck and he does not know what it is; he does not even fu lly know what debts he may have to pay, or what is owed him; nor does he know on what dates even those payments which he antici­pates may fa ll due. A business conducted on such lines would be in a terrible mess; and we find in fa ct that man is in just such a mess. f ... ) Now consider that this Ka rma is all that a man has or is. His ultimate object is to get rid of it completely when it comes to the point of surrendering1 the Self to the Beloved; but in the beginning the Magician is not that Self, he is only the heap of refuse fr om which that Self is to be built up. The Magical instruments must be made before they are destroyed (ibid., pp. 98-99 ). Aleister Crowley aJso gives some ideas on how to design the pentacle: All Pa ntac/es will contain the ultimate conceptions of the circle and the cross, though some will prefe r to replace the cross by a point, or by a Ta u, or by a triangle. The vesica piscis is sometimes used instead of the circle, or the circle may be glyphed as a serpent. Time and space and the idea of causality are sometimes represented; so also are the three stages in the history of philosophy, in which the three objects of study were suc­cessively Nature, God, and Man. The duality of consciousness is also sometimes represented; and the Tree of Life it­self may be fig ured therein, or the categories.

But the Pa ntacle will be imperfe ct unless each idea is contrasted in a balanced mann.er with its opposite, and unless there is a necessary connection between each pair of ideas and every other pair. The Neophyte w·ill perhaps do well to make the first sketches fo r his Pa ntacle very large and complex, subsequently simplifying, not so much by exclusion as by combi­nation, just as a zoologist, beginning with the fo ur great apes and man, combines all in the single word «p rimate.\" It is not wise to simplify too fa r, since the ultimate hieroglyphic must be an infi­nite. The ultimate resolution not having been performed, its symbol must not be por­trayed (ibid., pp. 97-98).

And in how fe w is that change, such as it is, a vari­able with intelligence and conscious volition! The dead weight of the original condi­tions under which we were born has co unted fo r fa r more than all our striving.

Therefore, making the pentacle requires the thorough examination and recognition of ourselves. In this sense, it will always remain the most imperfe ct of our magical tools one that we need to work on for our entire lives without ever completing it. It's the most individ­ualistic of all weapons and the greatest challenge of aU. THE ALTAR By now at the latest, the time has come to finally start thinking more seriously about the n1agical altar that you use for your ceremonial work. Up until now, we haven't paid much attention to this piece of temple furniture; it basically served the purpose of just holding our various utensils. Most modern magicians no longer bother making an elaborate altar, as the altar has become a purely functional piece of furniture. Usually a simple table or dresser is con­verted to an altar, and thafs all. Of course you can do this too. But before doing so, you should at least take a fe w minutes to meditate on how you want your temple to look when it's all done. Remember that ideaUy the temple is a tiny little universe in itself. In the same way that you as a magician want to shape the great edifice of life and fa te your­self, this should be reflected externally in your temple as well. The magic of the nineteenth century was primarily re sponsible fo r drowning in symbolism absolutely everything the magician did, owned, and surrounded oneself with. Modern fo lk often perceive this as well as many of the styles of painting, litera­ture, and music from back then, by the way as too extravagant and superfluous. The fact that magic can adapt to the external style of the times is proven by modern Chaos Magic that, fo r example, sometimes uses neon lights instead of candles, or mantras played from a computer recording.

The fo llow­ing ideas are merely examples of how we can approach the subject. Develop your own point of view, because that's the ultimate goal of this book in the first place. For magicians fo llowing the tradition of the Golden Dawn, the altar should be a double cube. Why this? Because the altar is, as Crowley writes, ((the solid basis of the Work, the fixed Will of the Magician; and the law under which he works.'' But the dou­ble cube is a symbol of the Great Work, since the doubling of the cube like the squar­ing of the circle was one of the great problems of antiquity. In this sense, the altar doc­uments the magician's knowledge of the laws of nature, which are also the laws of magic through which one works. The altar should be the height of one's navel, which is then used to calculate its di­mensions. (The height from the floor to the navel divided by two results in the edges of each cube.) ((Double cube,, is not necessarily to be taken literally the altar can certainly be one solid piece and you don't need to stack two cubes on top of one another. But in this case, the a1 tar should at least be painted to retain its double cubic nature by painting each cube a different color. The colors could be black and white, for example, to repre­sent the duality of our perception as well as our effort to always see both the light and the dark. We could also use silver (the moon) and gold (the sun), or green (for Venus) and red (for Mars). And we could also symbolically color each of the fo ur sides of the top cube according to the four elements. For this, Crowley uses John Dee's categorical system. According to his system, the side fa cing the east would represent Earth, while the west side would represent the element of Water, and so on, just like in the pentagram ritual The top surface could either be assigned to the element of Ether or Spirit, or used to represent our magical will, fo r example with a personal name glyph or sigil. We could just as well paint or engrave it with the seven planetary symbols. So you sec, there are countless ways to design your altar, and every magician should develop one,s own indi­vidual altar symbolism. The top surface of the altar can be covered with gold and then engraved or if using more reasonably priced gold leaf. painted with the kabbalistic Tree of Life. The altar is generally made of wood, and oak is often used as a symbol of the stub­bornness and rigidity of magical law, but acacia is sometimes used as wen as a symbol of resurrection. This is surely a question of what you can afford, and many magicians today prefer more reasonably priced wood or veneer. 300 Introduction to Ritual Magic (IX)"},{"pageNumber":310,"pageContent":"In practice, this kind of aJtar unfortunately poses a fe w problems. If the magician does­n't just happen to be a giant, using the navel as the basic measurement fo r an altar is pretty impractical, despite its symbolism. The surface is simply much too small to hold more than just the most necessary weapons, and if you want to set your magical diary or a few candle holders on it, too, you,U most likely run into problems. After all, you don,t want to keep knocking things over during a ritual because you don't have enough room! One solution would be to use a side table as an addition to your altar, although this will take up more temple space thafs usually scarce to begin with. Many magicians pre­fer to use a cabinet - type altar that has a few shelves or drawers to store at least some of their tools. The cabinet doors (or curtain) can also be decorated with symbols. Just try to find a symbol-logically nice but practical solution, so take your ti me tore­aUy think about your altar. Since you already have enough ritual experience now, you're more able to determine the demands that your altar needs to meet then you were at the very beginning. That's why we didn't discuss it until now. MAGICAL OATHS Similar to the magical name, the magical oath also represents an obligation that the ma­gician enters into for various reasons. In this sense, Crowley wrote: Word should express Wi ll: hence the Mystic Name of the Probationer is the expression of his highest Will. There are, of course, fe w Probationers who understand themselves sufficiently to be able to fo rmulate this Will to themselves, and therefo re at the end of their probation they choose a new name. It is convenient therefo re fo r the student to express his Will by taking Magical Oaths. Since such an oath is irrevocable it should be well considered; and it is better not to take any oath permanently; because with increase of understanding may come a per­ception of the incompatibility of the lesser oath with the greater. This is indeed almost certain to occur, and it must be remembered that as the whole essence of the Will is its one-pointedness, a dilemma of this sort is the worst in which the Magus can find himself Introduction to Ritual Magic (IX) 30 1"},{"pageNumber":311,"pageContent":"Another great point in this consideration of Magick Vo ws is to keep them in their proper place. They must be taken fo r a clearly defined purpose, a clearly understood purpose, and they must never be allowed to go beyond it. It is a virtue in a diabetic not to eat sugar, but only in reference to his own condi­tion. It is not a virtue of universal import. Elijah said on one occasion: \"I do well to be angry,; but such occasions are rare. Mo reover, one man's meat is another man's poison. An oath of poverty might be very usefu l fo r a man who was unable intelligently to use his wealth fo r the single end proposed; to another it would be simply stripping himself of energy, causing him to waste his time over trifles. There is no power which ca nnot be pressed in to the service of the Magical Will: it is only the temptation to value that power fo r itself which offends. One does not say: c'Cut it down; why cumbereth it the ground?\" unless repeated prunings have convinced the gardener that the growth must always be a rank one. \"If thine hand offend thee, cut it off. \" is the scream of a weakling. If one killed a dog the first time it misbehaved itself, not many would pass the stage of puppyhood. The best vow, and that of most universal application, is the Vo w of Holy Obedi­ence; fo r not only does it lead to perfe ct freedom, but is a training in that surrender which is the last task. It has this great value, that it never gets rusty. If the superior to whom the vow is taken knows his business, he will quickly detect which things are really displeasing to his pupil, and fa .milia.rize him with them. Disobedience to the superior is a contest between these two Wills in the inferior. The Will exp ressed in his vow, which is the Will linked to his highest Will by the fa ct that he has taken it in order to develop that highest Will, contends with the temporary Will, which is based only on temporary considerations. The Te acher should then seek gently and firmly to key up the pupil, little by little, until obedience fo llows co mmand without reference to what that command may be; as Loyola wrote: ccperinde ac cadaver.\" [ ... ]It is always something to pluck up the weeds, but the flower itself needs tend­ing. Having crushed all volitions in ourselves, and if necessary in others, which we find opposing our rea l Will, that Will itself will grow naturally with greater freedom. But it 302 Introduction to Ritual Magic (IX) •"},{"pageNumber":312,"pageContent":"is not only necessary to purify the temple itself and consecrate it; invocations must be made. Hence it is necessary to be constantly doing thirzgs of a positive, not merely of a negative nature, to affi rm that Will. Renunciation and sacrifice are necessary, but they are comparatively easy. There are a hundred ways of missing, and only one of hitting. To avoid ea.ting beef is easy; to eat nothing but pork is very difficult (ibid., pp. 63-65). Were you puzzled when you read that Master Therion himself the greatest preacher of all of free magical will places such value on obedience? In these modern times marked by democratic and even anti-authoritarian ideals, this is a pretty touchy subject. It can­not be denied that Crowley as a person wasn't exactly the best example for the exem­plary embodiment of the principles of command and obedience. Voluntary self-discipline doesn't mean putting on any old random st raitjacket, but rather ifs a prerequisite fo r certain experiences that wouJd be difficult or even impossi­ble otherwise. In this sense, self-discipline is the conscious and intentional establishment of certain experimental conditions in the same way a scientist would, for example, if he wanted to sterilize a medium for cultivating certain cell cultures. After all, \"concentra­tion\" also means eradicating the unnecessary in fa vor of the desired, or separating the chaff from the wheat. It has become fa shionable to counter every kind of compulsion with suspicion, with \"Staying Cool', as the motto, and there>s no place for self-restraint and asceticism. We, too, have blown this horn a number of times and proclaimed the great freedom that magic should lead us all to. After all, it was necessary (and surely still is today) to create a counterbalance to the rigid ascetic and self-chastising ideals of Christianity misunder­stood that even today in modern magic still occasionally lift it's ugly Gorgon,s head. For way too long, the fa ct has been overlooked that magic can and should be fun that hu­mans will progress much fa ster and more thoroughly when they)re motivated by plea­sure and fun. But this doesn't mean that things such as discipline and constant practice and con­sequently the self-discipline to counter all objections of idleness and fe ar, sluggishness and indolence have become unnecessary. On the contrary, we need to find a middle course between cheerless, blind obedience and the structureless, entropic n1ess of con­fl icting, self-neutralizing desires and ephemeral passions and cravings.

To prevent a rosebush from rot­ting, drying up, and dying off, it has to be intentio nally trimmed from time to time. Al­though it may hurt, it will prevent worse from happening. When you take a magical oath and that's something you most certainJy should do at least a fe w times in your magical career keep in mind that although you're limiting yourself in a sense, on the other hand it will enable you to accomplish much greater things than just the mere satisfaction of your temporary state of comfort. The Magician must build all that he has into his pyramid; and if that pyramid is to touch the stars, how broad must be the base! There is no knowledge and no power which is useless to the Magician. One might almost say there is no scrap of material in the whole Universe with which he can dispense. His ultimate enemy is the great Ma­gician, the Magician who created the whole illusion of the Universe; and to meet him in battle, so that nothing is left either of him or of yourself, you must be exactly equal to him. At the same time let the Magician never fo rget that every brick must tend to the summit of the pyramid the sides must be perfectly smooth; there must be no fa lse summits, even in the lowest layers. This is the practical and active fo rm of that obligation of a Master of the Te mple in which it is said: tel will interpret every phenomenon as a particular dealing of God with my sour) (ibid., p. 68 ). The statement that the Probationer can resign when he chooses is in truth only fo r those who have taken the oath but superficially. A real Magical Oath ca nnot be broken: you think it can, but it can't. This is the advantage of a real Magical Oath. However fa r you go around, you arrive at the end just the same, and all yo u have done by attempting to break your oath is to involve yourself in the most frightful trouble. It cannot be too clearly understood that such is the nature of things: it does not depend upon the will of any persons, however powerfu l or exalted; nor can Their fo rce, the fo rce of Their great oaths, avail against the weakest oath of the most trivial of beginners (ibid., p. 72). 304 Introduction to Ritual Magic (IX)"},{"pageNumber":314,"pageContent":"It\\ therefore good practice to view the magical oath in a functional way. An oath is more than just a resolution intention it's a voluntary bonding. So only bond yourself where you really want to. For example, you could start with a smaller '<oath, to do your magi­cal training exercises regularly in the next month regardless of what external fa ctors of resistance may arise. Then you could make an oath to get up every morning a half an hour earlier to perform a certain ritual. Making oaths (and of course, keeping them) is a useful exercise to strengthen yo ur willpower that can even improve your omen interpre­tation and subtle energy perception since these are automatically sharpened consider­ably through the required alertness, and soon you,ll begin to observe how the whole universe is helping you with your Great Wo rk just as soon as you,ve set the first truly se­rious impulse yourself. Of course, you should avoid \"oath inflation.', Use this powerful magical tool carefully and you,ll surely be able to enjoy its tremendous advantages. But it's the truly serious oaths that will have a long-lasting, deep impact that can change your entire life. The above text passages quoted from Crowley contain an example that has mean­while become quite popular. Whoever endeavored to take the magical oath of Master of the Te mple in his order (A.·.A. ·.) was immediately promoted from the grade of neo­phyte right up to the highest grade but, as mentioned, such oaths can be quite danger­ous and should be thought over very carefully. REPORTS FROM MAGICAL PRACTICE (111) Frater G. from K. was a highly creative, although sometimes quick-tempered, person who often applied his magic in an uncontrolled manner as well. The fa ct that he's now much more careful is a direct result of the fo llowing experience that he told me about once, and in my opinion ifs a perfect example of magical symbol-logic as we,re contin­ually confronted with in practice. Frater G. was extremely angry with a man who caused him a great deal of problems both in his job as well as in private matters. He felt this person had tricked, deceived, hu­miliated, and taken advantage of him. At the time, he wasn't aware that this is not a good basis for magical warfare, which generally requires emotional coldness or artificial fe el­ings that arc immediately banished afterward. So he decided to perform an extremely drastic act of magical warfare. He wanted his victim to get testicular cancer! Introduction to Ritual Magic (IX) 305"},{"pageNumber":315,"pageContent":"To do so, he worked with the principle of Fire and the archangel principle of Michael the actual technique he used is not important here . . But, at fi rst, instead of watching his victim get sick, he was only disappointed to see that nothing was happening at all. Then about a month and a half later, Frater G.'s own testicles swelled up to enormous size within just a few hours until they were nearly the size of apples and he suffered excruciating pain. He was rushed to the hospital just in the nick of time, as the doctors said if he had waited just a few more hours he certainly would have died. Frater G. didn,t have testicular cancer as he initially fe ared, but he did have to un­dergo surgery and suffered from the aftereffects fo r quite some time. But he fe lt that the fo llowing synchronicity was even more significant: The doctor that treated him was named \"Dr. Cancer, and his assistant was '' Dr. Michael\"! \"You can imagine the look on my fa ce,'' he told me, \"when I realized that the goal of my magical operation and the archangel principle that I applied were reflected in the names of my doctors after I was affected with a problem of the same body part that I aimed at on my opponent! Since then I've gotten much more careful when it comes to magical warfare and I only use it in dire emergencies in true self-defense., This is a perfect example of the magical boomerang phenomena. The energy that this magician released bounces right back to him and causes the exact same thing to happen to himself that was actually intended fo r his opponent. Such phenomena happen quite frequently and are certainly the reason that \"black', or destructive magic has gotten the reputation of being dangerous to the operator. How­ever, it would be wrong to want to interpret this as an automatic, moral-ethical means of punishment of «divine, origin, as though \"evil , would always fa ll back on its initiator. This may or may not be true on a cosmic (or karmic) level (after death), but it's surely not the case in the practice of everyday magical warfare. The explanations we discussed in the last section fo r fa iled operations of magical warfare could apply in this case as well. However, another fa ctor comes into play that's quite common in such cases of magical backfire as this: the magician's bad conscience it­self. We surely don't need to explain again that having personal reservations about a magical operation will deem it to fa il right from the start; whereby the degree of fa ilure is usually directly proportional to the intensity of the reservations. Frater G., just like 306 Introduction to Ritual Magic (IX)"},{"pageNumber":316,"pageContent":"Fraters P. and W. from the last section, was at best onJy able to temporarily bundle his power of anger during the ritual; he reacted instead of acting and, in doing so, he chose a method that may have corresponded to his characteristic nature, but not to his inner ethics. This is reflected in the close link of ritual symbolism ('(testicles,\" ('cancer,, \"Michael'') and event symbolism in this operation since it shows the extent to which G. had projected or (to his own disadvantage) objectified his magical energy. If just a little accident had happened with no apparent relation to his magical operation, it would have required a certain degree of paranoia to causally link one thing with another. But in this case, the magic symbolism manifested quite clearly in an externaJ sense, so it would be fo olish to deny that such a link exists. lfs extremely important to pay attention to such relationships. This is aJso the actual reason why Frater G.'s example is listed here in the first place: To be able to evaluate the results of a magical operation, an extremely fine touch and sharp intuition are required, but one must also remain rationaJ and realistic enough to prevent from falling victim to insanity or a persecution complex. If you want to be able to evaluate the success or fa il­ure of a magical operation objectively, as only a person with a firm grip on subjectivity can do in the first place, you primarily need to consider its symbol-logic. Unfortunately, there are way too many magicians that get utterly whiney and para­noid the minute an accident occurs after any kind of operation. Suddenly magic is to blame fo r everything, or there must be an evil, conjuring opponent to blame in order to distract attention from one's own stumbling blocks. \"Trust in Allah, but tie up you r camel firsf' is an Islamic proverb. There must always be a certain degree of external clar­ity before a magical operation can tru1y be evaluated. Wild guesses, hysterical hunches, suspicion, and distrust are not enough: Usually these are only confused with intuition and dist ract us from our own incapabil ity to observe ourselves and our actions with a certain inner distance. Therefore, heed the fo llowing advice. AJways take the blame yourself and never blame magic in general or another person. This surely isn,t always easy because many of our stumbling blocks are invisible. A bad conscience is often only unconscious. Only through constant self-observation and repeated compulsory actions that cannot be oth­erwise explained might it become clear to us that we're dealing with some kind of inner blockade.

To them it's a technical tool that's absolutely necessary if they want to avoid continual, self-caused fa il ure. Materialistically speaking, if we assume that the subconscious mind represents the magician�s \"raw material,, exact knowledge of the material is a part of working success­fully. What are we dealing with? What does it look like? Which laws is it subject to? The fo llowing example comes from England and is quite a fe w years old. Frater John was unemployed and decided to perform a Mercury ritual to solve his financial prob­lems. His goal was to improve his financial plight and general prosperity. Shortly after he performed the operation on the same day, he left the house and found a credit card on the steps that someone must have lost. Now Frater John was fa ced with a moral dilemma. Should he ignore the card or turn it in to the police? Or should he view the event as an omen, a successful result of his ritual, and use the card without permission? After all, magic demands that you seize the moment of opportu­nity that success brings before it slips away. Frater John took this axiom to heart. Up until the weekend, he lived the high life with the credit card he fo und; he forged the sig­nature of the lawfuJ owner and bought all kinds of things. This was fraud, of course, al­though he decided to stop the fo llowing Monday at the latest since the risk seemed too great. After aJI, credit card companies supply their contract partners regularly with a list of cards that were lost or stolen, and often require them to call back fo r verification, es­pecially for large transactions. On that Sunday, he discussed the situation with a friend. The friend had a diffe rent opinion. After all, it was the Christmas season with lots of hustle and bustle the card loss surely wouldn't be processed for at least two weeks, so he could use the card fo r at least another week without having to worry. Carelessly, Frater John heeded this advice. On Monday he was arrested while trying t.o buy a stereo system with the card. This example characterizes one of the main functions of the Mercury principle. Mercury is also known as the god of thieves and pickpockets. If you're planning to rob a bank, yo u'd be better off working with the Mercury principle instead of Jupiter; al­though Jupiter is ''great fo rtune\" fo rtuna major it also represents justice, and it never takes anything away from others, it only gives.

Frater John was sentenced to one and a half years in prison for credit card fraud. He was put in a fa irly liberal correctional institute.

Before imn1ediately reacting with an indignant \"I'd never do that!': please think about what we said about the Mercury principle. I can only st ress once again that the real problem with magic is not whether it works, but that it works! Surely you fe el as well that it's not all that desirable to gain magical success through crooked or even criminal means. But this is a question of n1agical (not symbolical!) pre­cision and experience. Understand magic as also being an opportunity to gain insight into your own ethics, and to recognize the course you want to take in life and what your true desires really are. Regardless of the moral-ethical debate here, I'd like to take this opportunity to point out that Frater John was probably only able to becon1e truly wealthy and prosperous after his release fr om prison because he was always willing to take risks in the first place·-in-eluding criminal ones in order to allow his magical will the opportunity to become true. Regardless of whether or not we condone his actions, the fa ct that magic was able to help him becon1e so successful was due solely to his uncompromising nature.

Of course, this is not only true about magic, but about life itself in general. The n1agician is an artist a true master of the art of living­on several levels all at the same time.

And he or she consciously assumes the sole and complete responsibility fo r one's actions every minute of the day. Ideally, his or her life is truly self-determined. If one wants to fo llow the ethics of society, if one wants to assume standard moral norms, one does it only because he or she freely chooses to do so and not because one's unconsciously succumbing to the pressure of the majority. He or she can be a thief and a benefactor, a trickster and a paragon, a devil and a god, because he or she has recognized that everything originates in oneself. He or she doesn,t blame fa te or a punitive god fo r mishaps, as he or she constantly accounts fo r one's own actions and lives according to the motto of the French Revolution, ni dieu ni maitre (\"Neither God nor master (reigns over me],).

Utopias are not necessarily there to be realized, they should be view,ed as goals to strive fo r in the sense of the Zen saying \"The path is the goal., The path to becoming the ideal magician is more important than actually achieving that state in the end; the work on oneself is more significant than the tria]s and tribulations of the travels.

If you haven,t already done so, get seven pieces (or discs) of metal that correspond to the seven planets. For gold, a finger ring or medaUion will work fine, too, as long as it's not engraved and doesn't contain any stones. In their raw state (the way you got them) place each piece of metal on the table in front of you on a black surface; a piece of black silk would be best since, according to tradition, ifs a good insulator. Now hold your pendulum the way you learned (see Exercise 16) over the metal and notice the way it swings. Note your observance on a piece of paper or in your magical dia ry.' Do this with aU of the metals. You don't have to do this all in one ses­sion; you can do this exercise over a period of several days, but if you do so, make sure to carry out the work at regular intervals and always at the same time of day. Now hold the first metal under a cold stream of water for about ten minutes while imagining that all undesired energies are being expelled and washed away. This is called de-oding. Afterward, dry off the metal without touching it with your hands (e.g., by wrapping it in a towel) and place it still untouched on the black surface. Repeat the procedure with the pendulum and observe the diffe rence, which you should write down as well. If you cannot observe any difference in the swing of the pendulum, you need to keep de-oding the object until you do. When you are finished, wrap the de-oded piece of metal (still untouched) in a small piece of black silk and put it aside until you start the next exercise. Now do the same with the other metals.

This is called odic charging. Then perform the next exer­cise. You can do this during the ritual, but it would be better to close the ritual first. Repeat this experiment with other objects as well; rock crystal and gem­stones are particularly suited fo r this, but so are water, rock salt, table salt, and stones of all kinds.

From our statements on money magic in the previous section on the classification of the pentacles/ • coins/discs in tarot, we know that the allocation \"pentacle = air\" is actually the older, original version. But the Golden Dawn, which most magic of today still thrives on, allocates the pentacles to the clement of Earth. This has become an established practice and to my knowledge was never changed in any of the modern magical systems that fo cus on the elements, which is why we'll stick to it here as well. 2.

Now we should start thinking about concrete ways to apply this in daily magical life. Once again we need to point out that accord ing to our experience thus fa r the sole deciding fa ctor that determines whether or not one's tnoney magic will be success­fu l is the magician,s attitude toward money itself. Not because money magic is just a playful aspect of money psychology, but because no other field of magic (with the pos· sible exceptions of astral magic and visualization) is affec ted in such a significant way by unconscious psychological factors that could systematically prevent success. Even sexu­ality, which is often burdened with all kinds of fears and inhibitions, is n1uch easier to apply magically than efforts toward financial wealth. Even when working with sigil magic, which is extremely powerful due to the fact that it can evade nearly aJI uncon­scious obstacles, our money magic will only be successful if we have thoroughly recog­nized and banished all psychological barriers in advance. M'aybe you can understand the problem better if you think about the fa ct that most magicians usually wait until the last minute to perform a money magic operation when it,s actually too late. A person who,s in a position of destitution (or even \"poverty,, which, of 315"},{"pageNumber":325,"pageContent":"course, is quite subjective) and wants to change one's situation magically has pretty unfa­vorable starting conditions. His or her subconscious is already conditioned to financial failure, and now in the moment of deepest despair, magic is suddenly supposed to cor­rect everything that has often been done wrong fo r years. This can be compared to the situation with nonmedical practitioners, naturopaths, and spiritual healers whose pa­tients usually only come after all other attempts of orthodox medicine have fa iled. Since personal money problems are rooted so deeply in the hurnan psyche, a great deal of pa­tience is required to solve them, and in doing so we need to accept the fa ct that the only way to start is by working with certain th ings that may seem to have no apparent, direct connection to the principle of money. Even in less dramatic situations, e.g., when the magician just wants \"a little spare cash;' old patterns of fa ilure and guilt play an important role. There's a helpful equation that we should take to heart right fr om the very first step we take on the way to becom­ing successful at money magic. Debt = Objectified Feelings of Guilt This equation mainly refers to personal, pressing debts (\"problem debts,,) of the kind that we often think ((just came up unexpectedly.\" Ifs a slightly different story with \"ex­ternal financing,') such as receiving a bank loan for starting a business, which is usually only granted after reaJ (although sometimes fictitious) securities are deposited; this type of financing is basically necessary in today,s society in order to ensure a smooth ('(lubri­cated\") course of business. Plus we,d like to point out that the above equation doesn,t n1ean t.hat debts in general are bad and need to be avoided at aU costs. On the contrary, the ability to deal properly with debts is a great aid because it's often necessary or help­ful in money magic operations to take a certain financial risk in order to give the magi­cal task more thrust. Besides, having debts is really not a negative quality, and it would be helpful to point out a few things in this sense: (a) no one has ever died fr om a lack of money; (b) all of the money that we,ve ever spent was at our disposal at least briefly and has therefore be­come an integral part of us that no one can ever take away (just like memories and 316 Introduction to Money Magic (II) '"},{"pageNumber":326,"pageContent":"everything else that we,ve ever experienced); (c) the value of money is in no way objec­tive, but rather is based on somewhat random arrangements that are at least theoreti­cally revocable at any ti me, and a ((minus\" or \"plus\" of the amount in question cannot and may not in any way have such a degree of power over us that wouJd cause us to psy­chologically perish. Even if you have to take on high debts due to an accident or an unl ucky inheritance for which you receive no recognizable material equivalent, you should still ask yourself why you (unconsciously) chose to be in this situation and/or what you wanted to learn from it! It won,t always be easy to find the answer to this question, but the pursuit of these answers wiU help us br eak away from the deadly, paralyzing paradigm of being a helpless ((victim of circumstance, and a pawn in the game of fate and whoever has trouble fighting such attitudes will never achieve any degree of success in any of his or her magical endeavors. Once, when l was having financial problems, one of my friends who was a million­aire recommended to me, ((When you,re completely broke and have no other funds to fall back on, take out a loan for $50,000. Then you'll never live a normal life ag ain. Either you,ll make it, or you'll go under., This advice is in no way as absurd as it might seem, because the fact is that we often live under internal and external pressure that we've cre­ated ourselves. In particular, freelancers and self-employed people who have no regular unemployment or retirement benefits can sing you a song about how the pressure to earn double that of what their salaried or civil service colleagues make inspires their cre­ativity, imagination, and boldness. The true trick of the trade, however, is not to fall vic­tim to the illusion that earning lots of money always involves hard work. Even if our personal experience often speaks against it. Closer observation of the esotericism of the money principle reflects the following rules. Introduction to Money Magic (II) 317"},{"pageNumber":327,"pageContent":"• Hard work is not the key to wealth; it merely contributes to the development of a sense of being poor and the triggering of money-related complexes and problems. • Money only comes to those who love it and treat it well. • The more we hate money, the more it will hate us. • The more we love money, the more it will love us. • Money is not just the means to the end; it's a unique creature with an individual life of its own -or at least we should treat it that way. • Money magic always involves leading a self-determined life and overcoming psy­chological fears and barriers. • Since the value of money is fictious, the magician needs to find out for oneself how important it actually is. Chart 19: Rules of the esoteric ism of the money principle Of course, these few sentences are merely a sampling of the overall complexity of money magic. For now, let's put aside all theoretical concepts fo r the time being and see what practical consequences we can derive from the above statements. Of course, there's no use in giving precise and therefore limitable exercises here, but rather we prefer to sug­gest general recommendations that we should integrate even more than usual into our everyday life. Until this takes place, and until we've successfully eliminated all psy­chological resistance, most money magic operations will most likely fail. If your experi­ence is different, then good fo r you; but as a general rule, you usually won't succeed in money magic until you've internalized the basics of proficiently dealing with money. We therefore recommend that you examine your own attitude toward money, life, and material goods before attempting any kind of money magic operation. It's easy to say ((The magician is the master of matter,'' but to what extent do we really take this seri­ously and to what degree do we retain our magical assurance and self-confidence when it comes to financial problems? 318 Introduction to Money Magic (II)"},{"pageNumber":328,"pageContent":"• Learn to take a sensual approach to money. • Determine how significant money has been in your life up to now. • Determine how significant money will be in your life from now on. • View money as a real living being and develop a loving relationship to it. • Determine mistakes you might have made in the past and how you can do bet­ter in the future. • Design a concrete training schedule based on the recommendations in the last section for developing a \"healthy attitude toward money\" and apply it to daily practice. • Don't practice any money magic until you,re absolutely sure of what you want to achieve. Chart 20: The principles of money magic operations In connection with the statements in the last section, these words of advice should be self-explanatory. Here's a little tip fo r sensibly dealing with money. We recommend treating money the sam.e way you'd treat a well-meaning spirit helper. Stroke it so.me­times, med.itate on its shape and color, its history, and, above all, on what it really means to you. Are you really interested in money itself, or do you reaUy just want to own things, or have material security, love, health, luxury, power, independence, etc.? Think about what we said in the last section. In the majority of cases, it would be a better idea to apply magic directly to your actual goaJ instead of conjuring for money as a mediator, or a \"means to the end.,' Along the way, we'U also learn to recognize what we truly want as opposed to what may just be the spontaneous copying of assu·med behavior. In the practical exercises section, you,ll find an exercise that can help you create the basis for successful money magic operations.

In Cairo, in the year 1904, AJeister Crowley \"received\" his Book of the Law (more specifically, Liber AI vel Legis) that he viewed as being a revelation of the supernatural authority called Aiwass. Now we don't want to go into detail about the exact circum­stances of this revelation and Crowley's interpretation of it. The important thing fo r us here is merely the fact that this ((Law ofThelcma, has found its way into modern magic. The Greek word thelema basically means ((will.', The compJete Law of Thelema reads as follows: Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the law, love is the law, love under will. Since our book has no intentions of being sectarian, we'll treat Crowley's system just as neutral and value-free as the systems of other magicians, granting it just enough space to provide a general understanding. To the Crowleyites or Thelemites reading this, please forgive us for not delving into every little ramification and detail of the Law of Thelema, but a general overview is quite sufficient enough fo r clarifying its basic princi­ples. However, we shouJd keep in mind that no other concept has given modern magic such powerful, fruit.ful impulses, with the possible exception of the magic of Austin Osman Spare and contemporary Chaos Magic. Crowley,s concept assumes that everyone has a \"True Will, as opposed to the mere wants or desires of the everyday ego. We can compare this Tr ue Will (or Thelema, as we,ll call it from time to time) to one,s <'calling,, or '(purpose', in life, with the goal of reaching a state of self-realization (Crowley doesn,t mention this process in more detail) without having to rely on a god or other transcendental authority to do so however, this doesn't exclude the possibility of such an authority being there from the start. According to Crowley, the goal of each magician is to recognize one·s own Thelema and to realize it. This is certainly not as obvious as it may first seem. On the contrary, it can be extremely tedious and painful, especially if you,ve been living in opposition to Introduction to Money Magic (II) 321"},{"pageNumber":331,"pageContent":"your own True Will fo r a longer period of time (e.g., decades). Then ifs not just a mat­ter of restructuring your thinking it may also require you to throw off a lot of dead weight that you even may have learned to love over the years. If, for example, after thirty years of working as a coolly caJcuJating businessperson you realize that your True WiU means repenting in sackcloth and ashes, indulging in asceticism and performing unpaid jobs of charity, you,re definitely going to have problems with your fa mily and environ­ment ranging from the taunting and teasing of your business colleagues who are cer­tain that you've fa llen victim to the «midlife crisis,'' to the complaints of your fa mily about the \"deterioration of their standard of living,\" right up to the \"friendly, letter from the bank or savings and loan association when you're no longer able to pay off your debts because you,ve written off yo ur income to some charitable organization. This may sound like a pretty unlikely and exceptional case, but experience has shown that the fa ll­out usually is much worse! Nonetheless> Crowley,s dictum reads \"Thou hast no right but to do thy will.,) And that's the way it should be, because if we assume that life is mainly about being happy or achieving the goals we set fo r ourselves, it will become clear in a magical sense as well that everything else is unimportant. Crowley's system also applies the premise that we,ll have the support and motivating power of the entire universe behind us once we've recognized our True Will and begin to live it out. It can be compared to swimming in a river since Thelema always exists in harmony with the overall will of the entire universe, living in harmony with one's own True WiU means swimming with the current of it all instead of fighting against it. If we take a closer look at this concept, we'll see that it resen1bles the Way of Tao, and indeed Taoism and Thelema have quite a bit in common. Many Crowleyites are often not aware that AJeister Crowley surely wasn,t the first person to assert the primacy of the individuaJ,s will. From the fa c quid vult of Father Au­gustinus von Hippo {354 430) up to the fayce que voudras of Fran�ois Rabelais in the second volume of his novel printed around 1532-1564 caJled Gargantua et Pan,tagruel (which mentions an abbey \"Theleme, as a sort of utopian antimonastery and symbol for hun1anistic freedom ideals), we realize that free will is not a new concept, and even the influence of philosophers such as Bergson {whose sister Moina was the wife of Mathers, the leader of the Golden Dawn), Schopenhauer, and Nietzsche can be unmis-322 Introduction to Money Magic (II) •"},{"pageNumber":332,"pageContent":"takably seen if we study the Book of the Law in more depth. A strong influence is also reflected in the well-known magic of Abramelin, which we unfortunately cannot deal with here in more detail. The magician's greatest difficulty is being able to unequivocally recognize one,s 'Thelema because the power of illusion is strong, the flesh is weak, and the spirit is in no way always willing. This is the ultimate goal of magic as Crowley understands it, in the same sense that the goaJ of the magic of Abramelin is to establish contact with one,s own \"Holy Guardian Angel,,, which we could also understand as a personification of our in­dividual Thelema. Similar concepts can be fo und in shamanistic magic and the magic of tribal peoples, such as with the so-called totem or clan totem. Crowley's system stops being magical there and turns into pure religion the prin­ciple of Thelema becomes a dogmatic doctrine in which the concrete-magical aspects that directly influence fa te are pushed into the background and belief itself and/or tran­scendental utopia seize predominance. We'U be examining this later on in more detail in connection with his doctrine \"Every man and every woman is a star.'' We have no inten­tions of disparaging the concept of Thelema, but in this aspect the subject goes well be­yond the intentions of this book as defined in the very first section. On the other hand, it's very important that the aspiring magician understands this concept, otherwise one may have trouble understanding the works of Aleister Crowley. These works are not really written fo r magical everyday practice, but rather fo r religious transcendental mysticism within Western occultism, fo llowing the example of Eliphas Levi. We,U discuss this in more detail as well. As a preliminary summary, ifs sufficient to say that \"Do what thou wilf' in no way means ((Do whatever you currently want to do,,, but rather \"Do what is your Tr ue Will.'' Crowley understood this to be the recognition and pursuit of one's own daimonium, and Thelema is both a vocation and an obligation that has absolutely nothing to do with the contin ual fluctuation of the wishes and desires of our tiny everyday ego. To Crowley, the magician is always a mystic, or a person who strives for the \"highest truth', regardless of whether or not this may violate the norms of common civil ethics and morals. Despite his undeniable contributions to magical practice, Crowley,s main intention was to found a new world religion; he admitted this himself a number of times, and this intention was Introduction to Money Magic (II) 323"},{"pageNumber":333,"pageContent":"also reflected in the 1928 Weida Conference where he attempted to have himself pro­claimed ((World Savior, by the German Pansophic Movement, which in the end led to the disintegration of this magic creme de la creme of German occultism and, among other things, also led to the founding of the Fraternitas Saturni. Even the subtitle of his magazine, The Equinox, clearly reflected this, namely \"The Method of Science the Aim of Religion.,, Nevertheless, there are a great number of Thelemites who would in no way describe themselves as Crowleyites. We,d like to examine the reason fo r this and the re­lationship between the two in the next section. 324 Introduction to Money Magic (II) •"},{"pageNumber":334,"pageContent":"• THELAMEN As we already mentioned in the last section, modern magic literature seldom differenti­ates between the lamen and the pentacle. But tradition views this differently and makes a clear distinction between the two, which is why we,ve chosen to discuss the lamen here separately as well, in order to be as thorough as possible. Crowley complained about the fa ct that Eliphas Levi didn,t distinguish between the lamen and the pentacle either, and many other older authors even confuse the two. The lam en is a breastplate worn by the priests of the Old Te stament as a tunicle fo r divination (see Deuteronomy 38:1 5-30). The modern Ia men, however, is just a simple metal plate worn over the heart. To Crowley, the lamen is a symbol of the sephira, Tiphareth, which is why it should express the harmony of all other symbols united into one. But there,s also another type of lamen that the magician uses to evoke a spirit. In this case, the lamen containing the symbols of the spirit or demon is placed in the triangle and worn on the magician's chest so actually there are two identical lamens. If the ma­gician only works with one lamen, which is generally the rule today if used at all, it should represent the goal of one's Great Work. In this sense, Crowley wrote: 325"},{"pageNumber":335,"pageContent":"In this La men the Magician must place the secret keys of his power. The Pa ntacle is merely the material to be worked upon, gathered together and har­monized but not yet in operation, the parts of the engine arranged fo r use, or even put together, but not yet set in motion. In the Lam en these fo rces are already at work; even accomplishment is prefig ured. In the system of Abramelin the Lamen is a plate of silver upon which the Holy Guardian Angel writes in dew. This is another way of expressing the same thing, fo r it is He who confers the secrets of that power which should be herein expressed (Magick, p. 111) . This strange uncertainty and vagueness is surely the reason that the lamen has nearly become extinct. On the one hand it should serve as a symbol of faith and invulnerabil­ity, but on the other hand it's basically a sort of demonic talisman used to evoke spirits. Whenever the lamen is used today, it's usually used to protect the heart chakra. In addition, it gives the magician a certain sense of security and strength, especially when it's fairly heavy and its weight can be clearly felt on one,s chest. On the other hand, modern demonology generally doesn,t use the lamen anymore since there are easier ways of evocation than making two identical laminas per demon. If you decide to make a I amen for yourself, make sure you truly understand the dif­ference between it and the pentacle; and of course you shouJd also know what purpose your lamen is meant to fulfill. THE MAGIC RING Most authors of magic literature treat the ring quite carelessly, or don)t even bother to mention it at aU. This is quite amazing since the magic ring is one of the most common instruments in the history of magic, and nearly every practicing magician has at least a small (but often quite large) selection of them. However, the ring is not an elemental weapon and does not stand for any specific symbolic principle; sometimes it acts as a fetish, or as a talisman or amulet, and occa­sionally it serves as a mark of identification (e.g., in a fraternal order) or the emblem of a certain grade in short, ifs a universal instrument of magic like no other that co m­plies with the magician,s intentions and can be used in an endless number of ways. 326 Introduction to Ritual Magic (X)"},{"pageNumber":336,"pageContent":"In this sense, it becomes clear that the ring cannot be fo rced into a rigid structure of rules, which may be the reason why (mostJy older) authors are so hesitant to discuss it. However, we feel that the magic ring is one of the most important magic weapons of all, fo r both practical as well as theoretical reasons. In a practical sense, the ring is lightweight and easy to use, and generally not too dif­ficult or expensive to make. lfs not easy to lose as long as it fits firmly on the finger, and it can also be designed to be inconspicuous (which, of course, may not always be the case), since even a simple gold or silver band can be magically charged and worn with­out attracting too much attention. Since the great majority of magical operations in­volve some kind of movements of the hand and fingers, it can be a good idea to enhance this by equipping the hand or fingers with an appropriate ((weapon.\" So it's quite common fo r a magician to make (or have made) at least one ring to doc­ument one's magical identity. For example, this could be a simple, wide band made out of a suitable metal engraved with the magician's personal motto in the fo rm of a sigil, or one that contains glyphs that represent the powers (e.g., elements, planets, or demons/angels) that one predominately works with or has concluded a pact with. Yo u could make a ring fo r constructive as well as destructive operations, which is charged through frequent use. However, we prefer working with at least one ring that unites both sides, light and dark. The design of the ring is completely up to the magician oneself. One could integrate certain gemstones (e.g., fo r planetary powers), use a mixture of metals (e.g., gold and silver to represent the \"Chymical Marriage,'' or the union of opposites), engrave the sur­face, or conceal engravings/decorations under a layer of n1etal (gold plating) there are no limits to one,s imagination when it comes to the design. Since a ring, as already mentioned, can also function as a talisman or amulet, a ma­gician might also make one to wear only on certain occasions or for certain operations, such as a ring charged with healing energy or money magnetic properties, a ring fo r evocations or fo r protection in magical warfare, and so on. In ancient Egypt, rings with images of the gods were often worn that served as a link to the corresponding energies. Lodge rings are the identification marks of fraternal orders, but can also declare a general bond to a certain principle . • Introduction to Ritual Magic (X) 327"},{"pageNumber":337,"pageContent":"THE MAGICAL WILL AND THE PRINCIPLE OF THELEMA (II) Thelemites, but not Crowleyites · how can that be? \"I am the Magician and the Exorcist. I am the axle of the wheel, and the cube in the circle. ceo me unto me, is a fo olish word: fo r it is I that go.\" Liber AJ, II, 7 In the last section, we already saw that Crowley wasn,t the first person in the history of the occident to deal with the concept of True Will, although he was surely one of its most radical and uncompromising representatives, putting him at least from an ideo­logical point of view among the ranks of the Marquis de Sade or Gilles de Rais, both whom he highly regarded, by the way. But even outside of Europe we'll find similar concepts, which we already touched on earlier. To illustrate this point further, we,d like to state one more example. We're talking about the '<vision quest'> that plays a significant role in cultures with a shamanic influ­ence, such as with the Native American Indians. Typically the apprentice shaman (or any young man about to be initiated as a full adult member of the tribe) ventures out to have a vision. Along the way, he may go through a phase of physical deprivation (fasting, sexual abstinence, isolation, self-inflicted pain), either in preparation or as an integral part of the actual vision quest itself. Sometimes after a long period of fasting, the person is given a fever-inducing drug and sent out into the jungle to receive a vision as a dream or daydream that will show him the further course of his life. If the vision reveals to him that he,s destined to be a warrior or shaman, and that he should leave his village and move to a foreign place or lead a war against a neighboring tribe, this is both a guidepost and obligation fo r the future. The statement \"I will follow my vision, is considered to be an incontestable justification to the other men1bers of the tribe, but it's obvious that such statements cannot be taken lightly, otherwise the protective spirits or the gods would punish it as sacrilege. There are a number of stories about such people who were unable to have a vision on their quest. Even after several tries, they returned unsuccessfully, which often resulted in terrible ostracism by the tribal community. This logically aroused the suspicion that the person sometimes '<cheated,, to avoid such a situation. The main reason we've men­tioned this is because it shows that even in today's romanticized esotericism, those oh so 328 Introduction to Ritual Magic (X) -"},{"pageNumber":338,"pageContent":"highly regarded Native American cultures often have difficulties with subtle perception, too, and can even be incapable of having visions!

In this sense, Crowley,s concept is in no way new as he himself liked to claim. Our example is in no way intended to devalue Crowley's statement) but in order to have an objective perspective of magic, we need to put it in the right context. In this way, we rec­ognize that being a Thelemite certainly does not automatically mean being a Crowleyite as well. This is important in this respect because the Crowleyites as all representatives of charismatic religions of revelation and salvation often claim to have a monopoly on the definition of Thelema, which in our opinion can be justified neither by Crowley,s Book of the Law itself nor by the historical Thelemic context. And the relevant literature on the subject rarely mentions the various possible ways of interpreting the concept of \"Thelema.'> Most Thelemites seem to assume that one's own personal Thelema is a fixed concept that you discover once and that never changes afterward. Such a concept has quite a bit in common with the so-called \"clockwork par­adigms, of earlier days when the cosmos was understood as a huge gear wheel machine (e.g., ewton's physics). However, due in part to the discoveries of modern particle physics, such models are beginning to lose their foothold, resulting in the fa ct that mod­ern magic increasingly turns to relativistic ideas, and even some elements of the philos­ophy of critic rationalism (Popper), structuralism (Levi-Strauss, Barthes, Lacan) and skepticism in general. Such a relativistic, skeptic magician will view Thelema as a \"tern­porary vision,, or a variable that's subject to change just like ev erything else in the uni­verse and, as a result, needs to be rediscovered and redefined again and again if its en­tire spectrum can even be recognized at all. But this is not the time to get into the speculative aspects of magical philosophy­practice comes first! Only through continual personal experience will the magician be able to develop a sound opinion on such things; anything else would be nothing but as­sumptions and hearsay.

Magic was aff ected by this as weU. On the one hand, we'll find statements of both Western and Eastern ori­gin that support the idea that the magician should submit and adapt to the structure of the whole, because only then will one be able to truly influence things and become a master builder who contributes to the Great Work. On the other hand, some believe that the magician takes over control once he or she begins to worship oneself, recognizes one,s own power, accepts it, and uses it according to one's will. The beginner is often confused by the fact that such contradicting statements are fre­quently used by the same magician; Aleister Crowley is a perfect example of this, but even authors such as Levi, Papus, Quintscher, or Bardon seem to cultivate this apparent confusion. Often it seems like an attempt is being made to establish a middle path for postulating a more mild form of free will by recognizing and accepting certain inherent (and transcendental!) constraints. That doesn't come as a surprise since the extreme form of both opinions cannot hold ground to real experience: Neither can it be ir­refutably proven that man has ever possessed any kind of free will at all, nor can we con­vincingly support the extreme opposite, namely that one has all fre edoms at hi s or her disposal. On a pragmatic level, we usually take the middle path anyway. Two examples can illustrate this: 1) A criminal offender is held responsible for his crimes by the community because he has the freedom of choice to refrain from detrimental behavior. Perhaps he could plead for milder punishment if he had acted out of a desperate situation (\"restricted free will',) that obviously overtaxed his powers and abilities. (A per­son dying of starvation could care less about the ownership claims of rich gro­cery stores.) 330 Introduction to Ritual Magic (X)"},{"pageNumber":340,"pageContent":"2) Despite one's power of will, she remains dependent on a number of natural, in­herent constraints, such as the need for oxygen and water for survival, and the fact that she cannot grow wings for flying, just to name a few. Basically, the claim of free will is nothing but a positive utopia. For example, even if hu­mans stiJl haven't been able to grow wings, it doesn't automatically mean that they never wiU. The magician is confronted with this problem on a daily basis because one con­stantly bumps into limits on one's ability to act, but at the same time one also sees bro­ken barriers that previously seemed unbeatable, which resulted in the expansion of one's scope of maneuverability. In this sense, he or she often finds oneself balancing on the thin line between having absolutely no self-esteem whatsoever (when expressed pos­itively = humbleness) and being equally absolutely megalomaniac (when expressed pos­itively = self-confidence). But the rea listic magician needs to maintain this inner and outer balance on this dangerous journey between Skylla and Charybdis and not sway from the middle path. 'To wrap thing up� lefs have a look at how Crowley handles this problem. The text passage quoted here is one of his more explicit statements on the subject: But even though every man is ''determined\" so that every action is merely the passive resultant of the sum-total of the fo rces which have acted upon him from eternity, so that his own Will is only the echo of the Will of the Universe, yet that consciousness of <'Free Wi ll\" is valuable; and if he really understands it as being the partial and indi­vidual expression of that internal motion in a Universe whose sum is rest, by so much will he fe el that harmony, that totality. And though the happiness which he experi­ences may be criticised as only one scale of a balance in whose other scale is an equal misery, there are those who hold that misery consists only in the fe eling of separation from the Universe, and that consequently all may cancel out among the lesser fe elings, leaving only that infinite bliss which is one phase of the infinite consciousness of that ALL.

Equally it is the destiny of the trainer to train. There is a fa llacy in the determinist argument similar to the fa llacy which is the root of all \"systems, of gambling at Roulette. The odds are just over three to one against red coming up twice running; but after red has come up once the conditions are changed. It would be useless to insist on such a point were it not fo r the fa ct that many peo­ple confuse philosophy with Magick. Philosophy is the enemy of Magick. Philosophy assures us that after all nothing matters, and that c<che sara sara.\" In practical life , and Magick is the most practical of the arts of life , this difficulty does not occur. It is useless to argue with a man who is running to catch a train that he may be destined not to catch it; he just runs, and if he could spare breath, would say \"Blow destiny!\" (Magick, pp. 66-67). Here the old master worded things quite pragmatically and austerely. And in the end, practice and experience are much more important than any speculations about de­terminism and free will anyway. ln any case, it's much more effective and satisfying to ig­nore the so-called \"limits of fate\" and live according to the principle that we are the mas­ters of our own lives. On the other hand, though, there's little sense in overtaxing oneself with childish delusions of omnipotence, only to put the blame on magic in the end. That's why in the same context Crowley stresses the importance of ('magical under­standing,,, which the magical will requires to thrive. 332 Introduction to Ritual Magic (X)"},{"pageNumber":342,"pageContent":"• THE MAGIC BELL Apart from the fact that many magicians like to implement the usc of sound in order to highlight certain phases·or sections of a ritual, the magic bell has a great deal of symbol­ical significance, just as a1l other ritual weapons do. It's considered to be a sort of((astral bell', thafs used to announce the establishment of contact to <'another world,\" literally \"ringing it in.\" It therefore serves as a tool for both capturing attention and warning, but also for celebrating majestic passages of a hymn or intensifying the communication with the invoked powers, and can theref ore also be used as an instrument of ecstasy. In addi­tion, the ringing of a beU marks the interruption of profane time in the magician's uni­verse while it conforms to one's will for this one eternal mon1ent. Crowley's description of a magic bell is not much different from that of a cymbal with a clapper hanging from a leather strap that's strung through the middle hole of the cymbal and knotted firmly on the other side. He requires the bell to be n1ade of elcc­trum magicum, which is an alloy of the seven planetary metals that played a significant role in medieval alchemy as well. The individual metals should be melted together one after another during favorable planetary constellations gold and silver are melted first during a favorable aspect of the sun and moon, then tin when Jupiter is favorable, and· so on in the same manner. 333"},{"pageNumber":343,"pageContent":"In practice, Nepalese or Tibetan cymbals that can be bought in Asian stores are most commonly used. Although these are often claimed to be made of electrum (which the layman cannot prove, of course), the most important thing is their beautiful sound. Cymbals are generally bought in pairs, with the two disks being connected by a leather strap. They are played by lightly striking the edges of the disks together. By slowly sepa­rating the cymbals after they are struck, interesting sound effects can be created (rang­ing from a \"whimpering, to a subtle rumbling sound), which can help induce a state of trance as well. However, we'd like to point out that most modern magicians no longer use the bell in a symbolic sense. Although they do indeed still use bells, cymbals, and other resonant instruments, they are usually nothing more than ritual accessories with no symbolic power. THE MAGIC LAMP In Crowley,s system, the magic lamp is a metaphysical symbol and instrument of im­mense complexity which has led cynics to say that his directions fo r making one are just about as easy as telling a student to make a light bulb with one's bare hands. However, Crowley never really gave any recommendations on how to make one; on the contrary, the lamp is a ritual weapon that the initiate in his order (A.·.A.·.) is encouraged to make even without the permission of one,s superior and it requires no approval from others. This is because the lamp symbolizes to him the «light of the pure soul:, the \"image of the Most High,,, and is comparable to Moses' vision of the burning bush. lfs the eternal light of enlightenment that hangs above the altar and is nourished by the element of Ether alone. Its light is \"without quantity or quality, unconditioned and sempiternal,\" Crowley writes (Magick, p. 102). He continues: Without this Light the Magician could not work at all; yet fe w indeed are the Magi­cians that have known of it, and fa r fe wer They that have beheld its brilliance! { ... 1 Whatever you have and whatever you are are veils befo re that light.

Let's have a look at these categories here and explain them in more detail. After all, it's about time we start delving deeper into this subject since it just may be the most significant field of modern magic today. Carroll basically distinguishes between two types of gnosis in his book Liber Null, namely the inhibitory mode and the excitatory mode. Schematically, this looks as fo llows: 337"},{"pageNumber":347,"pageContent":"Inhibitory Mode • Death posture • Magical trance concentration • Sleeplessness • Fasting • Exhaustion • Gazing • Hypnotic or trance-inducing drugs • Sensory deprivation Excitatory Mode • Sexual excitation • Emotional arousal, e.g., fear, anger, horror • Pain, torture • Flagellation • Dancing, drumming, chanting • Right way of walking • Excitatory or disinhibitory drugs • Mild hallucinogens • Hyperventilation • Sensory overload Chart 21: Forms of magical trance (according to Pete Carroll) First we,ll be taking a closer look at the inhibitory mode since you,re already fa miliar with some of its elements from the practical exercises in this book. But first we'd like to point out the fact that the two basic principles of magic, namely the \"spiritual blazing of a fire, and the establishment of((spiritual peace as deep as the ocean,\" are both reflected in this trance structure. The type of trance chosen depends just as much on the tem­perament of the magician as on the goal of one,s corresponding magical operation. THE DEATH POSTURE We've already discussed the death posture here in depth, so there's no need to mention it again. This forced state of empty mind is and will always remain one of the most vital keys to unlocking magical powers and skills, and there's no way of emphasizing just how important it is that every magician practice it. Concentrations Leading to Magical Trance 1. Object concentration. This includes tratak, among other things. Of course, this form of concentration can be expanded on in numerous ways. 338 Structures of Magical Tra nce (I)"},{"pageNumber":348,"pageContent":"2. Sound concentration. The magician concentrates on acoustically perceptible, ar­ticulated, or imagined sounds, usually mantras, in order to block verbal thoughts from intruding while at the same time developing the key to words of power and the skill of spell casting. (It's sort of a ritual exercise in rhetoric.) 3. Image concentration. The magician concentrates on images or symbols, such as a circle, square, or cross. More complicated image sequences can also be used. This is the key to mental magic and working with the magical double, as well as to cre­ating psychogons and charging sigils through staring. Even demonology relies heavily on this technique. With these three forms of concentration, the magician can gain control of the parts of one's mind that are responsible fo r both pictorial as well as verbal thoughts. Surely if we focus on a magical statement of intent, this becomes an extremely pow­erful magical technique, provided that we can at least maintain or better yet, im­prove the state of trance reached in the meditation exercise. As opposed to many earlier authors, we prefer not to work with visualization tech­niques alone in practical magic since experience has shown that the results of such tech­niques are insufficient and sporadic. In cases of doubt, a closer look will reveal that all three fo rms of concentration are actually used in every successful rnagical operation From what we,ve already said about the structure of the psyche and the laws of fo r ... getting, as well as symbol-logic and the fuzzy relation, it should be clear by now that this form of magic is much more effective and thorough than mere mental autosuggestion techniques that work mainly with concepts and rarely with images and sound. This is reflected in the fact that thought concentration which used to be an integral part of the magic of the past is rarely used today in modern magic. Back then, this usually took the fo rm of concentration on the magical goal, the magician's desire, or on one,s statement of intent. 'This form of thought concentration has been replaced by the use of the state of empty mind technique (which is probably a result of Eastern, in par­ticular Tibetan, influences); after achieving this state during a tnagical operation, a sym­bol of the magician's magical will is disguised and implanted into the subconscious. This is especially clear in sigil magic, but we'll be encountering other disciplines (such as doll magic) that use this technique as well. Structures of Magical Trance ( 1) 339"},{"pageNumber":349,"pageContent":"But in your practice, please don't forget that although the techniques listed here can lead to gnosis, they alone do not yet represent tr ance. Sleeplessness, Fasting, Exhaustion With the help of these techniques, everyday reality is \"softened, and the magician be­comes more receptive to subtle perception since the censor weakens with time. De­scribed by Pete Carroll as \"old monastic fa vorites, (Liber Null, p. 34), these inhibitory techniques are still part of the standard repertoire of all shamans and nature magicians today. The trick is for the magician to be able to turn the confused state of consciousness that these three techniques will eventually produce into a true and powerful magical trance in which one retains enough control to impregnate oneself with the magical will. In simple, exaggerated terms, there's no point in fasting until you pass out unless you're able to charge your magical will at the moment you lose consciousness. However, overexaggerated self-deprivation is useless; it's much wiser and more effec­tive to find a moderate level of sleeplessness, fasting, and/or exhaustion that custom fits the magician's natural (and trained) gnosis ability. But this is a matter of personal expe­rience and is difficult fo r an outsider to judge, even though many magicians and shamans are able to develop a fe el fo r the trance ability and depth of a person and there­fore help one accordingly in order fo r one to achieve optimal results. This is exactly what the participants in a group operation demand of a ritual leader since he or she's respon­sible fo r activating, storing, impregnating, and directing the energies of each participant on an equal level to reach a common goal. TheoreticaUy, the sign of a true master is the ability to synchronize each and every one of the participants of a group ritual (even under unfavorable circumstances) to cre­ate the desired level of gnosis while at the same time in trance keeping an eye on things and being able to respond if a participant seems to be losing control. If you work frequently with experienced magicians of the Black Arts, you'll surely observe this quite often. Unfortunately, there are exceptions to this rule as well. For example, magicians who work with the Eastern paradigm of wu-wei (\"action through nonaction,') generally pre­fer to fo cus on the overall quality of the group,s work instead of on each individual's success or fa ilure at achieving the proper state of trance. Of course, in these cases we often observe that such masters harmonize or balance out these released energies either 340 Structures of Magical Tra nce (1)"},{"pageNumber":350,"pageContent":"unconsciously through the sheer power and quality of their own force field, or by con­sciously eliminating any dissonance on the subtle energy level in a subtle way, which usual1y only the experienced eye will be able to see. Gazing We,ve already discussed this subject thoroughly in connection with the ((magic gaze, so that no further explanation is necessary here. Hypnotic or Trance-Inducing Drugs Regardless of the legal aspects associated with this subject, the use of drugs for magical purposes is generally not recommended. This applies in particular to the beginner, es­pecially for those who have already experimented with many types of drugs and stiU do so on a fa irly regular basis. A trip is a fa r cry from a ritual! Although a ritual can (but does not necessarily) lead to states of altered consciousness that strongly resemble those induced by the use of drugs, it doesn,t work the other way around, meaning that drugs do not necessarily lead to magical rituaJ. The main problem is that drugs not only cause the loss of the mental and physical control that's required for a magical operation, but they also blunt the sharp will. This is often overlooked, especially by young magicians who like to imitate Crowley's drug escapades, but in his case (which is also overlooked as well) these drugs were often medically prescribed (e.g., he was originally given heroin to treat his asthma attacks), and eventually led to a lifelong addiction that he was victim to on and off right up until his death. But even during his addiction, Crowley was able to maintain his strength of will and a stable personality that most of his young admirers today fa il to do. A later fr iend of Therion's once told me how he had an asthma attack in the middle of a conversation three years before his death; his face turned blue and he was just barely able to stumble over to the dresser to grab his heroin injection that was already prepared and ready to go. Afterward, Crowley made his friend promise never to touch or obstruct him in any way if this ever happened again since this injection was his last lifesaver. At the time, Crowley's doctor had aJready started drastically reducing his heroin prescriptions, which the old magician had quite a hard time adjusting to since he was already accustomed to such a high dosage of the drug. But at least he had enough willpower to always keep at Structures of Magical Trance (I) 341"},{"pageNumber":351,"pageContent":"least one injection on reserve in case of a dire emergency of suffo cation. How many junkies today would be able to do that? Although shamans often use drugs to stimulate trance, this is done in an entirely dif­fe rent sociocultural context, and to the shamanic community, this use of drugs is con­sidered a sacral act so that any abuse would surely be punished just as severely as in our culture today. Some of the hypnotic and trance-inducing drugs include alcohol in large amounts, cannabis, sleeping pills, and tranquilizers, as well as a number of psychopharmacologi­cal drugs. When administered by a true expert, it's indeed possible to induce a useful magical trance, but the disadvantages surely outweigh the advantages. The onJy time the use of drugs should be considered is if the magician has severe inhibitions that prevent one from achieving a state of trance (which is occasionally the case with con1pletely un­trained beginners), and in extremely visionary operations and those that work with ((soft, group energies; the latter is occasionally the case in sex magic. Sensory Deprivation The technique of sensory deprivation was and still is used among monks and hermits alike, along with occasional practices of seclusion. Its goal is to reduce the number of ex­ternal impulses that affect our rational thought as much as possible, which will eventu­ally cause it to paralyze due to the lack of stimuli. During a ritual, we create sensory deprivation by using blindfolds, hoods, and the el­ement of darkness. Experience has shown that due to the \"shock effecf, it causes, it's much more effective to shut out externaJ stimuli fo r just a short period of time instead of banishing it entirely over a longer period. Long-term sensory deprivation is usually more suited for mystical practices. The «Samadhi Ta nk, (or \"Meditation Ta nk'') is an excellent modern machine de­signed by consciousness explorer John C. Lilly fo r working with this type of gnosis. In this tank, a person floats atop approximately two inches of brine with an extremely high salt concentration (similar to the Dead Sea); the door and walls of the tank block out all optical stimuli and external noise. Even after just a fe w minutes, the person will lose all sense of time and wiU experience an extraordinarily deep feeling of relaxation since the high propelling fo rce of the brine supports the entire weight of the body, taking all pres­sure off of the muscles. Such tanks can be bought in stores, but they can also be found in • 342 Structures of Magical Trance (I)"},{"pageNumber":352,"pageContent":"• therapy centers in most larger cities. Whoever hasn't had this experience yet should cer­tainJy try it out. As aJready mentioned, it strongly depends on the personal pref erences and goals of the magician as to which fo rm of gnosis one should choose. It's obvious that an aggres­sive operation of magical warfare would be easier to perform with an excitatory trance than with inhibitory gnosis. On the other hand, such an operation could be aimed at breaking down the opponent or his or her situation, which would surely benefit more from a sort of\"corrosive inhi bitory trance.,, But within both of these two categories, there are fine differences that each individ­ual magician will most likely express in a com.pletely unique way so that no fixed rules can be given. Ideally all methods should lead to the same level of gnosis, but in practice there certainly are differences that are probably related to the fa ct that the magician al­n1ost never induces a full trance with complete loss of consciousness since this would n1ake him completely subject to the will and influence of others. Every magician should be thoroughly familiar with the various energy qualities of the methods introduced here so that one,s able to form one,s own educated opinion about their advantages and disadvantages. Plus, it's a good idea to always have several techniques on hand in case it's too difficult or impossible to perform one method for some reason or another. For example, it would be pretty difficult to induce true sensory deprivation in the subway, but magic gazing or sound concentration would be much easier under such circumstances. It's important to master and not just achieve a state of trance, otherwise it can lead to just the opposite of what the magician actually intended. That's why persistent prac­tice in this field is a high priority for all types of modern and shamanic magic. REPORTS FROM MAGICAL PRACTICE (IV) Aleister Crowley once told a story about a magical operation with strange effects that has meanwhile become quite well-known. Once he was waiting fo r an urgent letter fron1 a certain person that lived several thousand miles away. Finally he decided to perform a ritual to fo rce the letter to arrive. In fact, the letter actually did arrive a few days later·-. but it had been mailed more than a week before. Below is a commentary on this event Structures of Magical Tra nce (I) 343"},{"pageNumber":353,"pageContent":"taken from the column <'Tante Klaras Kummertempet>' in the German magic magazine ANUBIS (it is no longer in print). There have been several suggested models of explanation fo r such occurrences. The easiest and probably most common explanation due to its simplicity says that this was a case of divination: The magician intuitively senses that a certain event is imminent and acts instinctively in order to ((bring it about.', The question is, however, whether the desired event actually would have occurred without the ritual even though it had already been triggered. (The letter could have gotten lost, fo r example.) There's no way to test this, of course, but some magicians recommend performing a ritual even fo r things that have already been achieved befo re the operation! This would at least be a way to finally wrap up the matter using the symbolic language of the soul, and a religious person might even turn this ceremony into a ritual thanksgiving. Modern magic is concerned more and more with getting to the bottom of this problem of ((retroactive conjuring,\" as this phenomena is technically called. After all, we modern conjurers live in a world of science fiction and stories about travels through time in which even physicists calculate time \"backwards. \" If magic were actually just a way of directing information (and many things support this theory, which is how the word \"cybermagic, derived fr om the word \"cybernetics,,, or ((the science of control systems\" has recently developed to describe a modern fo rm of magic that's currently evolving); if information exists beyond the limits of time and sp ace and can be trans­ferred beyond these limits as well (which would make the whole theory of incarnation unnecessary!) · aft er all, it doesn,t have any mass and possibly no energy as well , we see a possible fu ture model of explanation rise above the horizon which would make any poor old lady's head sp in. Because then the question would be \"Can we change the past with magic? Can we afterwards, mark you! shift the switches of time?\" Honestly I'm still hesitant to propose such a profound, reality-shattering claim. But if, and I repeat, if it really is this way, then retroactive magic would be dealing with \"memories of the fu ture,\" making the space gods and UFOs of Charroux and Daniken seem like nothing but wimps in comparison.

Even on a physical level, all three of these emotions can lead to the release of unsuspected skills; just think about the unbe­lievable sheer physical power of someone who is raving mad, or about the perseverance and physical power of people in panic situations. The effectiveness of these three emo­tions is certainly just as strong as that of sexual excitement, but they have the disadvan­tage that they're quite difficult to arouse without a great deal of effort. AJthough system­atic training can help remove some of the obstacles along the way and every magician should undergo such training it remains nonetheless quite difficult to get a fit of rage on command and then use it magically. Initiation through others is a different situation. In ancient as well as in modern times, the power of fear and horror has been used effectively, and (( initiation through fear,, is an appropriate, well-known phrase. Pain, Torture, and Flagellation This method of trance is the complete opposite of sleeplessness, fasting, and exhaustion. While the latter calms and inhibits, the former ignites body and spirit. Extreme, unbear­able pain always climaxes with either unconsciousness or lust because the human or­ganism can only handle lasting pain through ecstatic acceptance. The penitent practices of the Middle Ages with their jumping processions and self-flagellation, the fakir prac­tices of Hindus and Christians in Sri Lanka and the Philippines these are all examples of access to ecstasy by paralyzing the intellect and the censor and sharpening the spirit to the same degree that a magician requires for his magical operations. Of course, these methods have the great disadvantage that they can lead quickly to ineffective and highly dan1aging excess. Because even if the human body is supposedly quite insensitive to pain 348 Structures of Magical Tra nce (II)"},{"pageNumber":358,"pageContent":"naturally or through conditioning, the stimulus threshold gets higher and higher until eventually only self-mutilation will be able to achieve the desired effect. This is why we strongly warn against excessive use of this practice. Dancing, Druintning, Chanting lfs a different story with dancing, drumming, and chanting. Practiced alone or in a group, these techniques can quickly lead to a quite usable excitatory trance. The magi­cian's musical and gymnastic skills (or lack thereof) are of no importance whatsoever, although group work certainly requires more coordination than when working alone in the temple. In particular, African and Afro-American religions (Voodoo, Macumba, Candomble, Santeria) make use of these methods, as does shamanism throughout the world, ranging from the Tunguska region in Siberia to the Sami of Lapland, to the Na­tive Americans of North and South America to the Aborigines of Australia. Chanting in­cludes mantras and rit ualistic songs, exaltation through lyricism {hymns), the telling of myths and ((barbaric names of evocation,') or magic spells and words of power. When supporting a magical operation with music, distinct rhythm and a certain monotony (the effect of repetition) are important. Experienced drummers usually begin with a heartbeat rhythm that the insti nctive nervous system will automaticaiJy adapt to after swinging with it harmoniously for awhile. When the rhythm gets faster, the participants' heart rate will automatically adjust to a certain degree. Magical Walking • Magical walking is a technique that's related to Zen walking, but goes well beyond this. This involves walking for long stretches while using the 180° gaze, whereby the hands, fingers, and arms should be held in unusual positions. Experience has shown that press­ing the thumbnail sideways into the top of the sensitive pinky is quite effective. This cre­ates a certain pain thafs completely harmless as long as the skin is not damaged. Even­tually, thinking will cease and the mind will become totally absorbed in its environment. rrom this description, it's clear that this technique is not really suited for conducting a specific magic operation (with the exception of charging a mantric sigil), but can be used quite effectively for training such states of consciousness. The technique of hyper­ventilation (see below) can be used here in addition as well.

Basically, there's not much more to say. Excitatory or inhibitory drugs and mild hallucinogens (re­member, it's the dosage that co unts) include alcohol in small amounts, cocaine, small and moderate doses of cannabis, as well as LSD, mescaline and psilocybin, along with some modern designer drugs, and, of course, stimulants (amphetamines). Tea (usually hot) made from galangal root is milder yet still quite eff ective. This is a legal substance, by the way. But even black tea, coffee, and tobacco can have an excitatory or inhibitory effect, although the price of one's health must be paid. This is why we'd like to empha­size once again that for the reasons mentioned we strongly warn against the use of drugs! Hyperventilation is induced by fast, powerful panting over an extended period of time (generally from five to fifteen minutes, sometimes longer) and causes an excess of oxygen in the brrun that can cause real hallucinatory effects. If you have health problems that affect your heart or respiratory system (lungs, bronchial tubes), you absolutely need to consult your doctor or non medical practitioner before attempting such techniques. In fact, due to the catatonic cramps that often occur, this practice should only be done under expert guidance in the first place. This also applies to people with general circula­tory problems, as weU as asthmatics and epileptics. Sensory Overload While monasteries and hermitages serve as special places to experience sensory depriva­tion, a state of sensory overload can be experienced nearly everywhere. To do so, several techniques are used all at once in order to stimulate all sensory organs simultaneously or in succession in order to induce a state of excitatory gnosis. Inhibitory methods can be used here as well since they can achieve the opposite effect when embedded in a cycle of excitation. For example, one of the classical methods of tantric training includes keep­ing the candidate awake over an extended period of time while his eyes are blindfolded (sleeplessness), then subjecting him to flagellation (painful torture), and, afterward, giv­ing him hashish and taking him to a cemetery at midnight where he copulates with his gurini (female guru) atop a corpse to unite with his divinity.

It would be impossible to list absolutely everything here that has made the moon (including the goddess Luna and her pantheon relatives) the ultimate symbol of magic throughout the course of the l 0,000-year history of Western and Eastern occultism. We already mentioned the expression \"sublunar, world that was used during the Middle Ages and the Renaissance to describe all earthly things as well as (and in particular) all magical and enchanting aspects of life itself. The moon,s influence on our earthy lives has been the subject of intensive research fo r quite some time. For example, we,re aware that the rhythm of the tides is indirectly caused by the n1oon's gravity; the menstrual cycle of a woman lasts about one-moon month; bar owners claim that their guests seem to drink more at the full moon, and psy­chiatric clinics often report that their patients are particularly restless during the full or new moon; some statistics have shown that the number of car accidents and suicides in­creases significantly during these same phases as well (although this is somewhat con­troversial); the reproductive cycles of many sea creatures, such as sea urchins, scallops, and the palolo worm, are closely linked with the moon's phases, as are those of humans and many plant types. And, of course, we've aU heard of somnambulists, or sleepwalkers 353"},{"pageNumber":363,"pageContent":"(called ((moon addicts,, or Mondsuchtige in German) in this state of slumber, one often does astounding things, such as balancing on the rooftop of a house with closed eyes. Although not all aspects of the moon's influence have been thoroughly researched, sci­ence can no longer deny the fact that there,s a lot of truth to the old sayings and customs about the moon. It, then, should come as no surprise that the moon's significance has grown so much over the years, and that many cultures (such as modern Islam) even base their calendar on it instead of the sun. But the equation ((moon = female principle, is not as fundamentaJ and unchangeable as many magic circles seem to think; in many languages (such as German), the moon is considered to be \"male,, and ancient moon gods such as the Egyptian Thot/Tahuti (who was later associated with Mercury) were male as well. But it's not our intention here to delve into these quite complicated and confusing developments and peculiarities; after all, since the time of Agrippa and Paracelsus, Western magic has basically only known a female moon principle. Since the moon works in mysterious ways, e.g., by controlling the \"juices\" that we could equate today with hormones; since it swells up in the sky, grows, bulges, and gradually shrinks again until it finally disappears completely during the new moon (sun conjunction); and since it can make the night brighter or darker depending on its illumination, it has become a symbol for mystery, intuition, and the deepness of the soul, and rules over the authority that controls magical powers and makes them effective. Magicians that have a stronger relationship to the sun instead of the moon almost always tend toward mysticism and religion. Although sun magic is truly a serious magi­cal practice, the place where magic has always thrived and prospered is within moon cults; sun cults generally result in priesthood and organized religion that often bind an­archic, individualistic magic in chains with the intention of wanting to \"civilize,, it through monopolization. The classic example is the Christian Church that denies or re­jects all magical practices (which they refer to as \"sacraments,,, or even ((miracles of God\" on a rare occasion) unless performed by a priest acting as ((God's servant,\" while empha­sizing prayer and intercession. When we as planetary magicians begin studying the lunar principle, we should be aware of the tension between the two poles formed by the sun and the moon. Of course, 354 Planetary Magic (IV)"},{"pageNumber":364,"pageContent":"a good planetary magician will always take both aspects into consideration when plan­ning an operation in order to combine the two energies into one constructive fo rce in­stead of letting them fight each other head-on. The secretiveness of the moon, however, has a dark side as well that's often perceived as threatening; this dark aspect is symbolized by the new moon (or ((black moon''). The question as to what came first, the association of the moon with the female principle (and fear thereof) or the fear of the female principle and the resulting projection of this fear on to Earth)s satellite as well, can probably never be answered. But surely this con ... tempt fo r the moon, which has no light of its own (as opposed to the sun) and ((merely\" reflects, has helped create the symbol-ideological superstructure fo r the suppression of the woman and everything she stands fo r and represents. This is certainly related to the instability and changeability that the moon constantly demonstrates. \"Sublunar\" also means \"variable, inconstant,\" which is why the moon was usually considered to be the \"evildoer, in classical astrology. In contrast, the principle of the sun is based on rational and efficient calculability. After all, the sun doesn,t \"die'' every month, and despite the biannual solstices to mark its \"death\" and ''birth,\" the sun's nature is basically constant. For this reason alone, sun cults are automatically forced to fight against such individualistic lunar magic that threatens every status quo. Because while the sun principle embodies the raison d'etat and \"collective common sense,', the moon ecstatically destroys all of reality's limits and exposes the fiction of a predictable world over and over again. In this sense, the often bloody conflict between male priests and fe male witches which is a sort of battle of the sexes is something indispensably natural. Let's not forget, however, that both are united androgynously in the Mercury princi­ple (which is usually quite inconspicuous in the sky as well as in the horoscope) and therefore able to grow above and beyond this basic polarity. But here, too, it has always been the moon cults that have embraced this androgynous ideal as opposed to the sun religions that are only fixated on imperialistic, collective thought.' Another difference between the solar and lunar principles is something that any planetary magician shouJd recognize: The sun is centrifugal, while the moon is cen­tripetal. This means nothing more than the old rule that the male is expansive while the female is contractive, although it would be quite helpful for modern people to get used Planetary Magic (N) 355"},{"pageNumber":365,"pageContent":"to these other descriptive terms as well. Centrifugal means spinning away from the cen­ter or axis along the way, very few foreign things are assimilated permanently and most everything burns up in its own fire (decentralization). Centripetal, on the other hand, means moving toward the center or axis along the way, many fo reign things are assimilated permanently and combined in a sort of melting pot where it eventually be­comes an integral component of the whole (centralization). This also embodies the phallic and vaginal principles, or \"lingam, and ((yoni\" in Eastern terminology or ((extro­verted\" and \"introverted,, in Western terms, giving and taking, aggressiveness and pas­sivity, and so on. This should all be nothing new to you, although it might be a good idea to think about how and where this is expressed concretely and practically in every­day life and of course in your own magic as well. Even today, many magicians work according to the princip]e that constructive oper­ations should only be performed during the waxing moon, with destructive operations taking place during the waning moon. Although this general rule of thumb has proven effective, our level of knowledge today demands much more from us than just working in such a mechanical way. The fundamental idea behind this system is surely correct: that humans and everything else alive are subject to natural microcosmic and macro­cosmic rhythms . 2 But there are also justified objections to this. For example, a magi­ciao's personal experience will surely reflect deviations from this norm that, in our opin­ion, can be better explained by the differences in each magician's individual biorhythm instead of the actual influence of the moon itself, which is without a doubt quite signif­icant as well. In this sense, many magicians can observe in themselves phases of ener­getic highs and lows that often shift without any recognizable pattern. For example, you might always seem to experience your magical, energetic high during the full n1oon, and feel dull and weak during the new moon/ but after several years of practice, this could easily change, minimally or even quite drastically. Being a moon magician also means being aware of your own personal moon rhythms and cycJes. So this is the first step in our moon work as well. Begin by system­atically observing the phases of the moon, your own levels of energy at various times, your world of dreams, visions, and success in divination work, and so on.

This shows us how important it is to pay attention to rhythmic cycles of all types daily rhythms, weekly rhythms C'blue monday,\" weekend phases), as well as monthly (menses), yearly, and even life-cycle rhythms (childhood/youth/old age, menopause). The moon as the epitome of all rhyth­mic processes not only affects all kinds of cycles, but is also an excellent indicator that can help us practice and implement rhythmic thought and action that is so vital on the sym­bolic level. Plus, rhythm is something like «structured time\" that can grant us access to this all-controlling yet nearly impalpable dimension. Let's stick to Solomon,s wise advice since he,s always been considered one of magic's earliest forefathers: Fo r everything there is an appointed time, and an approp riate time fo r every activity on earth: A time to be born, and a time to die; a time to pla11t, and a time to uproot what was planted; A time to kill, and a time to heal; a time to break down, and a time to build up; A time to weep, and a time to laugh; a time to mourn, and a time to dance.

So much nonsense has been written about this sub­ject, and this entirely un-Western thought principle has also been so fundamentally mis­understood and \"Christianized.'' But although nowadays many New Agers at least say that karma is not a \"sin, in a Christian sense, but rather a law of cause and effect, in practice this is an entirely different story. Karma is often exalted to a sort of de-Chris­tianized sin, with the main goal being to collect as much ((good, karma as possible while avoiding \"bad, karma at any price, and the most banal everyday problems as well as extreme hardships, birth defects, and illnesses are blamed on sins fron1 (4past lives'' with such uncritical naivety that it reminds a person of one of Thomas Mann's not so flattering essays on metaphysics. Gautama (the historical Buddha) is partially to blame fo r this since he tended to use this method to discipline his students. What irritates modern magicians the most today is the constant claim of self-named '<wise men\" (who usually have no idea about practical magic whatsoever) that any kind of magic can bring about the worst karmic results an unequalled fo rm of demonization with the reverse side being the bigotry that continually flares up, because in reality these apparently \"in­formative,, media attacks against \"satanic cults,, and ((devil worshippers\" have occasion-ally destroyed a magician's existence with completely groundless, unproven accusations. One of the sharpest critics of this fa ulty development surely is and remains Aleister Crowley, which is why we,d like to quote him here in depth. This idea of Karma has been confu sed by many who ought to have known better, in­cluding the Buddha, with the ideas of poetic justice and of retribution. We have the story of one of the Buddha's arahats, who being blind, in walking up and down unwittingly killed a number of insects. {The Buddhist regards the destruc­tion of life as the most shocking crime.] His brother arahats inquired as to how this was, and Buddha sp un them a long yarn as to how, in a previous incarnation, he had maliciously deprived a woman of her sight. This is only a fa iry tale, a bogey to frighten the children, and probably the worst way of influencing the young yet devised by human stupidity.

Bunyan fo r­gets to mention that by the time Passion had broken all his toys, he had outgrown them. Karma does not act in this tit-for-tat-way. An eye fo r an eye is a sort of savage jus­tice, and the idea of justice in our human sense is quite fo reign to the constitution of the Universe. Ka rma is the Law of Cause and Effect. There is no proportion in its operations. Once an accident occurs it is impossible to say what may happen; and the Universe is a stupendous accident. We go out to tea a thousand times without mishap, and the thousand-and-first time we meet some one who changes radically the course of our lives fo r ever. There is a sort of sense in which every impression that is made upon our minds is the resultant of all the fo rces of the past; no incident is so trifling that it has not in some way shaped one's disposition. But there is none of tlzis crude retribution about it. One may kill a hundred thousand lice in one brief hour at the fo ot of the Baltoro Glacier, as Frater P. once did. It would be stupid to suppose, as the Theosophist in­clines to suppose, that this action involves one in the doom of being killed by a louse a hundred thousand times. This ledger of karma is kept separate from the petty cash account; and in respect of bulk this petty cash account is very much bigger than the ledger. If we eat too much salmon we get indigestion and perhaps nightmare. It is silly to suppose that a time will come when a salmon will eat us, and find us disagreeable.• On the other hand we are always being terribly punished fo r actions that are not faults at all. Even our virtues rouse insulted nature to reverzge. Ka rma only grows by what it fe eds on: and if karma is to be properly brought up, it requires a very ca reful diet.

REPORTS FROM MAGICAL PRACTICE ( V) The effect of love spells is an interesting element when it comes to monitoring the re­sults of a magical operation. Strictly speaking, most so-called love spells are really bind­ing spells. Generally, the intention is to cause the target person to form an emotional at­tachment to the magician or his or her client and to take advantage of this. The problem with such spells is that they usually bind the magician or the client much stronger to the target person than the other way around. The success of the magical operation soon be­comes an obsession until nearly nothing is left of the familiar principle of \"nonattach­ment/nonlack of interest., On the astral/imaginative level, the target person can even take on the form of an incubus or succubus (an extremely energetically charged and powerful astral sexual partner or demon) that requires a great deal of experience and self-control in order to deal with properly, otherwise it could resuJt in an extreme loss of energy that could even lead to near complete de-oding and the related consequences. The same applies to demonology as well. Therefore experience has shown that it's always a better idea to perform a general Jove spell instead of aiming for a specific target per­son. In other words, you should conjure for «a lover', without specifying who. Then the magician or the client still has the choice of seizing the resulting opportunity or not. 364 Planetary Magic (IV)"},{"pageNumber":374,"pageContent":"Such an opportunity is nearly impossible with binding speUs. For example, if the target actually reacts to the spell as intended, he or she may ((cling', to the magician/client to such a degree that it would take a great deal of effort to rectify (after all, the attraction was an act of magic) and such a situation often results in a catastrophic crisis. The following two examples are taken from my own experience. A good fe male friend of mine once asked me to charge a love talisman to help her find a partner. Al­though she had already had several relationships, some even parallel to one another, the situation was unsatisfying in the long run and she now wanted a stable relationship. Surely she was also curious as to how such a talisman would work fo r her, because apart from a fe w rituals we did together, she had very little experience with magic. I decided to make a Venus talisman according to the traditional principles. First I calculated an election, or an astrologically suitable time to perform the operation based on my client's horoscope. Shortly before the ritual, I engraved the sigil of the planet Ve nus (according to Agrippa) on to a round copper plate, and on the other side I en­graved my clienfs personal sigil that I designed according to the principle of Aiq Bekr. Finally, I added the three geomantic symbols, Puer (((boy\"), Puella (''girl'>), and Con­junctio (((union,,), which I fe lt were weU suited fo r such an operation because of their name symbolism. Then I held the Ve nus ritual (alone), in which I first performed an in­vocation and then guided the activated energy into the talisman. The client received the charged talisman along with a short written explanation on how to use it, including the instructions to first wear it on a Friday (Venus day) at sunrise (Venus hour) fo llowing a fifteen-minute meditation after putting it on a green velvet ribbon that she obtained herself, and to wear it for at least seventy-seven days. She followed these instructions carefully and exactly. About ten days later, she reported the first success. My friend/client had received half a dozen love letters from various men. Some were fo rmer lovers, but some were mere passing acquaintances. At first this was frustrating because the wide selection confused her. But there was also a letter from the man that she actually wanted, which she didn't teU me until afterward. This man later became her partner, so the operation can be con­sidered a success.

Two weeks later he called me, completely depressed. The talisman was sup­posedly causing strange things to happen he nearly crashed in an airplane and an im­portant business deal was suddenly cancelled. In short, he felt that the talisman was bringing him bad luck instead of good luck. My queries revealed that he didn't follow the instructions when activating the energy of the talisman, which was already the first problem. We agreed that the situation with the airplane crash was certainly not an effect of Venus, but rather of Mars plus, there was still the objection that the catastrophe ac­tually didn,t happen and was av oided. The planned business deal proved to be a project that was unstable right from the start. Although some business matters can be attributed to Venus (trade), I didn't see any reason to link this with the talisman, because the talis­man wasn,t charged with the Venus principle in general, but rather specifically with love-related things. Plus, in order to bring about such negative reactions, the talisman would have to be charged demonically (with few exceptions), which wasn't the case. This example shows how important it is to make a clear distinction between the var­ious correspondences. This is especially important for magicians and clients who have a lot of fear or superstitious beliefs since they're often based on a lack of self-confidence or conscious/semiconscious feelings of guilt. A good three and a half years later (!),my client called again about the same matter and asked if it were possible to decharge the talisman that seemed to be still causing him problems such as nightmares. At our next meeting, he finally told me the true reason of his discomfort: The client was homosexual and had a stable relationship with another man. He originally wanted to use the talisman to be able to cheat on his partner on occa­sion since the relationship was getting to be too \"close-knit, but he was extremely self­conscious and shy. Since he got the talisman, he sometimes had heterosexual nightmares, while the relationship with his partner grew even stronger and more loving no sign of cheating. He admitted that he was ((actually, happier than ever before in his relationship. 366 Planetary Magic (N)"},{"pageNumber":376,"pageContent":"What happened here? I have to admit it was my mistake that I oversaw my client,s hon1osexuality. Even though he hid it from me, I should have seen it in his horoscope, or noticed it otherwise. In my opinion, this shouldn't happen to a good magician. Even today, I still cannot find any indication of his homosexuality in his horoscope, which is still no excuse for my mistake. On the other hand, the talisman did indeed bring about all of the Venus-like effects that one could expect under normal circumstances: intensi­fication of an existing love relationship, (hetero )erotic dreams (remember the geomancy symbols that were used!), happiness. If the client would have revealed his homosexual­ity to me, or if I had guessed it otherwise, I certainly wouldn,t have recommended a Ve nus talisman, but rather a Mercury one instead since the androgynous Mercury prin­ciple is also responsible fo r homosexuality, among other things.; A Mars talisman would have been possible as well since this would emphasize the purely sexual nature of the magical desire; on the other hand, Mars is much more ag­gressive, while Mercury is responsible fo r a variety of diverse contacts. 6 Instead of Puella, I should have used Puer twice. After our conversation, I offered to decharge the talisman for the client, but he was­n't interested anymore and admitted that he actually did receive what was best fo r him. This is perfect proof that the popular psychological \"placebo effect\" explanation doesn,t always apply in the case of talismans and amulets. Since the client believed that he was getting the ((right, talisman, it should have worked anyway, at least according to the placebo effect explanation; after all, he had no knowledge of magic whatsoever and was therefore unable to interpret the symbols that were used to find out how it was truly charged. Instead, he got the effect that I intended. I,d like to conclude with a few words about the \"honesty\" of clients wanting love spells. Practice has shown again and again that a great degree of thoroughness and sen­sitivity is required of the magician in such operations; because most clients conceal the most important details, either because they're ashamed to be so open, or because they don't realize the importance of the information, or fo r other reasons. Often clients don't even really know what they want or why they have problems in the field of eroticism, and often they'U put the blame on external factors (especially popular: \"black n1agic,) or on a blow of fa te only self-criticism falls either entirely too short or is exaggerated to such a degree that it takes the fo rm of auto-aggressive behavior. Planetary Magic (IV) 367"},{"pageNumber":377,"pageContent":"The magician should always pay careful attention to the psychological state of one's clients and have an extensive conversation with them in advance in case one needs to co­erce important information out of them that they may either consciously or uncon­sciously be concealing. This isn,t because the magician has a voyeuristic interest in the private life of one's clients, but is rather an effort to truly help them as best as possible. Because a magician's professional ethics (especiaUy when working for a client) require one to always do one,s best, and in order to do so, one needs as much information as possible in order to get a good overall impression of the whole situation. If the client doesn,t trust the magician, however, and intentionally withholds embarrassing details, I would recommend the magician to not take on the job at all, since there's only hope of success when the client consciously and unconsciously is willing to cooperate. This, of course, applies in the same sense to all magical operations performed for others.

In order to understand such concepts better, it would be a good idea to first take a look at the various models of magic of the past and present, especially since this will also play a significant role when we later discuss the use of talismans and information or cyber magic. When reading the fo Uowing, please keep in mind that the categories listed here are merely meant to help illustrate our point and rarely occur in the simplified, pure fo rm stated here a mixture of the various fo rms is generally the rule . • THE SPIRIT MODEL Surely the oldest paradigm of magic is the spirit model. With this model, we assume the existence of real supernatural beings (spirits, demons, helpers, etc.) and the magician can comn1unicate with them, get to know them, become friends with them, or submit to them as their servant. Here, the magician acts as a mediator between life on earth, or everyday reality, and the world beyond. This model is still characteristic of all types of shamanism, and most laypeople (including journalists and theologians!) base their opinions of magic on it as wcU. In We stern Europe, this model enjoyed its greatest pop­ularity during the Renaissance, and is still used by many traditionalistic magicians today. 373 •"},{"pageNumber":383,"pageContent":"• In this day and age, it can be fo und in the magic of Bardon and Gregori us, while the en­tire Golden Dawn system and a great part of O.T.O. teachings are based on it as weJI, just as the majority of German occultism of the 1920s. Aleister Crowley used a mixed form, as we'JJ see later on. In the spirit model, the goal of the magician or the shaman is to obtain access to the world of creatures that we'll describe here as ((magical entities.)) This world has its own set of laws that the magician must learn in order to survive and to utilize the powers and the entities there. Each entity has its own name and fo rmula and displays a specific, un­mistakable character, and can therefore be considered an individual personality that has strengths and weaknesses. With the help of trance, the magician travels to their realm where one can either make friends with them or have them serve one's self, provided that one has enough knowledge and power to do so. Such relationships can even be quite dangerous at times, since some spirits, such as demons, may not be all that eager to serve the magician and/or just might not like him or her. And they often charge a high price fo r their ser­vices, which could even require a blood sacrifice or something similar. A well-known ex­ample of this is the pact that Dr. Faust made with the Devil (((selling one's soul in return fo r material and intellectual success',). Although the exact terms of such a pact are a matter of negotiation, there's always the danger (just as with humans) of a breach of contract, a new interpretation of the agreement, or other difficulties, so that the magician needs to be continually alert un­less of course one only works with ugood,, spirits with a moral integrity that one can trust completely. 'From what we've said above, it's clear that'spiritualism (which origi­nated in America in the mid-nineteenth century and is still popular all over the world today, now often called ((channeling\" by New Agers) is an excellent example of the spirit model, even though it generally focuses on divination and prayer instead of on actual magical operations. Once the magician has secured the assistance of \"one's\" spirits or demons either with a friendly pact or through fo rce one uses it in one,s magic in the same way one would use the assistance of a common human helper as well. But since these entities are immaterial, they can work on levels that common servants cannot, such as on the astral plane. Plus, most spirits arc \"specialists', that are generally superior to the magician in 374 The Pa radigms of Magic • I I • • • I • I I I • I I I • • • • • • •"},{"pageNumber":384,"pageContent":"their field of expertise. For example, a magician would summon the Mercury demon Ta phthartharath to achieve magical goals that are related to the Mercury sphere, while the Mars demon Bartzabel would be summoned to destroy an opponent or to learn the art of warfare. Or, one could use a planetary intelligence such as Yophiel (Jupiter sphere) to improve one's state of prosperity. The shaman generally has certain spirits of one's own that are specialized in certain areas (e.g., healing illnesses, making rain). For exam­ple, instead of sending healing power to a sick person from a distance, the magician can . send one's spirit helper directly to the patient.1 Spirits and demons want attention, or want to be \"fed,\" and can even rebel or de­mand a \"pay raise.\" And they're not infallible. Just because they,re experts doesn't mean that they cannot make mistakes or fa il; but in general they can expand the rnagician's scope of action considerably although the quality of one,s magic depends on the amount of control one has over such spirits. So those are the basic concepts of the spirit model. It requires the magician to ex­plore an already existing world and to learn and follow its rules right down to the last detail. For example, if one doesn't know the \"true name,, or the ((correct fo rmula, that gives power over such transcendental entities, all of one's efforts to gain control of them will be in vain. Even the means of communication with these entities or their magical language needs to be learned, and much of this knowledge is guarded secretly and only passed on directly from master to apprentice. Therefore, thorough training is gen­erally required before magical operations can be performed. THE ENERGY MODEL With the triumphant march of mesn1erism around the end of the eighteenth century, the Western conscious mind began to focus on internal bodily processes and energies. Al­though Mesmer basically only rediscovered ancient healing methods (hypnotism, sugges­tion, healing sleep), he made them socially acceptable in a culture that had made a clear distinction between the body and spirit fo r centuries. Suddenly, it was sensational news to learn that the mind can influence the body and even make it sick or heal it. For Mesm.er, the means fo r all healing was \"animal magnetism,\" a vital fo rce that cannot be more closely defined in scientific terms. The concept of 44VTil fo rce\" developed by Bulwer-Lytton, who was a Rosicrucian and a magician himself, as well as the odic teachings of Reichenbach, The Pa radigms of Magic 375"},{"pageNumber":385,"pageContent":"are both proof of the impact that this change in awareness had, which significantly in­fluenced Hahnemann's homeopathy as weU (which was a predecessor of cyber magic, as we'll soon see). And Bulwer,s friend, the extraordinarily influential magician Eliphas Levi, caused quite an uproar in the occult scene just about fifty years after Mesmer's death with his concept of\"astral light., This made a significant impact on magic as well. Although the Golden Dawn still principally remains loyal to the old spirit model even a century after Mesmer,s death, it has been strongly ((softened>' by psychological-anin1istic elements such as those taken from Indian yoga (e.g., teachings of chakras and prana). But the energy model didn,t actually celebrate its climax until after World War II, or more specifically during the occult renaissance of the 1960s, that mainly took place in England. This was surely aided by the strong influence of psychoanalysis, which didn't make its big breakthrough until after the war, even though magicians such as W. B. Yeats, Austin Osman Spare, and Aleister Crowley began integrating the concepts of psycho­analysis into their n1agical practice at a relatively early date. In general, the energy model in its pure form rejects every kind of spiritual thesis. The magician is no longer a conjurer of spirits, but more of an '<energy artist.\" The focus is on subtle perception, and the magician must be able to perceive, polarize (''charge,), and direct energies. If, for example, one senses a lack of energy in the kidney area of one)s patient, one would transfer charged healing energy to the affected kidneys, possi­bly by placing one's hand on them and/or by using special crystals or gemstones. Talis­mans and amulets (which of course are used in the spirit model as well) are examples of artificial \"objects of power,\" or tools that the magician ceremoniaUy calibrates in which one stores certain specific energies for immediate or later use. When the magician wants to transfer power (and thafs the main focus of the energy model), one either has to have enough power to do the job his- or herself, or one needs access to one or more power sources. In the first case, the magician becomes a walking battery, while in the second the magician becomes a channel or medium for ''higher)' or at least \"other\" powers. And power isn,t always just power. Depending on the system of magic used, the spectrum ranges from a complicated web of \"positive, and ((negative', energies to the ((neutrality thesis, in which the magician his- or herself is responsible for «polarizing, the naturally neutral energies. With the lat ter, there's always too much or too little desired or undesired energy (for example too much fire in the kidney area: in-376 The Pa radigms of Magic"},{"pageNumber":386,"pageContent":"fection); the equation of ((positive = good'' and <'negative = bad, (which is usually de­nied in theory, but often fo und in practice nonetheless) generally doesn't apply here, and the only important thing is the ability to direct the energy to its proper place. Depending on the amount of power required, the magician might even be too weak to act. In magical warfare, the stronger magician always wins (not the \"good, one), un­less the weaker one can compensate fo r lack of power through speed and skill. The ma­gician must be able to rely on oneself or, at best, on physical colleagues who might help, and there's no use in summoning a \"higher authority\" although one can try using a ((stronger, energy than one,s opponent. Power centers such as the chakras or acupuncture meridians often play an important role in the energy model, and the charging of objects such as talismans is done through the power of imagination. For example, the magician might imagine a colored beam of energy that one bundles with a certain gesture or spirally projects into the object to be charged with hands, dagger, or wand; fo r a Jupiter talisman, one might imagine a blue beam, fo r example, while green would be used fo r Ve nus. When attacking an opponent, the magician either sends an excessive amount of destructive or corrosive energy (e.g., Mars or moon power), or one draws off the opponents' energies and weakens them. In doing so, the magician usually doesn't summon the hierarchy of angels and demons C'princes of hell'') of the individual planets or kabbalistic spheres. Instead, one generally activates a planetary principle through magical trance and then uses this energy to do everything else instead of sending some kind of being or entity to do the job. Just as the hierarchies of angels and demons are greatly reduced in the energy model (or even eliminated completely by the pure \"energy dance,'), other external authorities lose significance as well. The job of the \"master', is now done by a ((teacher,\" and the strictly obedient <<apprentice, has become a \"student.', The independence that results from this is strongly noticeable in the individually anarchistic and pragmatic systems of modern magic that place more importance on the personal experience of the magician instead of on the power and might of tradition. This naturally demands higher performance from the magician as well .. One must be able to do just about everything without any external help (including help from ((beyond\") and needs to have a very high level of personal energy since the self mainly functions as a power battery. When one is weak and tired) the quality of magical operations will suffer, The Paradigms of Magic 377"},{"pageNumber":387,"pageContent":"and the effectiveness of one's magic depends directly on the amount and quality of one's own energy. Plus, one also needs to have excellent, well-trained, and reliable skills in subtle perception. THE PSYCHOLOGICAL MODEL: A MIXTURE The impact that Mesmer and his successors made on the eighteenth century is compa­rable to that of Sigmund Freud and Albert Einstein in the twentieth century. Freud and Einstein were revolutionary pioneers of a fundamental, radical change in thinking that drastically shook up the mechanistic view of the world until it eventually burst. In a certain sense, Freud's theses were derived and developed from Mesmer's con­cepts, and ifs no coincidence that the founder of psychoanalysis originally focused on the study of hypnosis and hysteria. What Mesmer publicly demonstrated in Europe just before the French Revolution with displays and exhibitions is what Freud and, in partic­ular, Georg Groddek (the fo under of psychosomatic medicine) tried to prove scientifi­cally a good hundred years later, the realization that many, if not all, illnesses have men­tal causes, and that the mind is able to affect and influence the body. Since we have no intention of going into the comprehensive details here, this brief information will have to suffice. Mainly, it's meant to illustrate the effect that this devel­opment had on magical practice. The first two well-known magicians to apply psycho­logical or psychoanalytical thought to a greater degree were Aleister Crowley and Austin Osman Spare. Crowley toyed with the psychological model fo r quite some time, espe­cially in his middle-age years, although he later became a firm supporter of the spirit model, even though he was moderately skeptical at times. Spare, on the other hand, went just the opposite direction some of the theses in his magical writings seem to be taken from a textbook on psychoanalysis. Strictly speaking, the psychological model is just an empirical ((mixture', since it doesn't really go beyond the spirit and energy models, but instead strengthens the ho­mocentrism of the latter while disputing the basis of the spirit model by denying the ex­istence of spirits in an objective, external sense but not in a subjective, psychological one. In addition, it doesn,t explain magic with new or diffe rent mechanisms, but instead it just relocates its place of origin namely deep inside the psyche without really ex­plaining the way it works. Of course, such a claim needs to be proved. 378 The Pa radigms of Magic"},{"pageNumber":388,"pageContent":"According to the psychological model, magic is merely an animistic phenomena. Everything that the magician perceives or does while performing one,s art takes place in­side the psyche where a certain mechanism (that's never more closely defined) causes the desired (or even undesired) results. The authority responsible fo r magic is the un­conscious mind (or, according to Spare who uses Freud's terminology, the subcon­scious) this is where aU magical activity takes place. The supporters of this theory (and these include nearly all modern-day authors of magic) never mention a word about how the subconscious actually performs this ((miracle.,, But above all, with this model, the magician becomes a psychonaut. While one used to be a spirit trader and later an energy traveler, one now becomes a ((journeyer to the soul.\" By exploring the internal realm of the psyche and cartographically mapping it out, one learns the laws that can help take magical control over one's own life and the world around. This approach which is doubtlessly not perfect in theory does have considerable advantages that explain its current popularity. First of all, iCs fo rmulated vaguely enough to avoid getting tangled up in pseudoscientific debates about things such as ((Does od really exist or not?, and \"Can it be measuredr, It leaves this up to parapsy­chology. It cannot really explain magic, but instead it simply and pragmatically asserts that the manipulation of the psyche can lead to magical results, and it is content to ac­cept this observation as an \"explanation, instead of focusing on the question as to how such manipulation can actually be induced and controlled. This corresponds to the modern-day utilitarian way of thinking that's much more interested in the \"how,, instead of the \"why,\" as Crowley once put it as well. In a rela­tivistic world where the inhabitants can no longer be sure of any kind of«truth'' what­soever, whether referring to religion, politics, science, or magic, the magician who sup­ports the psychological model is a personification of the spirit of the times. Plus, magic explained in psychological terms has the advantage of being easier to comprehend by many people who have grown up with and are already fa miliar with such psychological models of thought, as compared to the belief in spirits and demons that has suffe red quite a few cuts and bruises inflicted by scientifically based atheism. The mixed-form nature of the psychological model can be recognized by the fact that as practice has shown it can be superbly combined with the other two models that we've discussed so fa r, which is indeed done quite frequently. We 've used this model again and again throughout this book as well, and will continue to do so in order to illustrate The Pa radigms of Magic 379"},{"pageNumber":389,"pageContent":"certain aspects of magic. Some \"variations\" include magicians who add an animistic aspect to the spirit model while still communicating with spirits, demons, and angels, but seeing in them mainly \"projected images of the soul', (which, of course, has proven to be quite in­effective when it con1es to demonology); and magicians who apply the energy model with­out taking it too literally, and refer vaguely to \"the power of the subconscious.\"2 The literalness applied to the exact wording of pacts with demons and the devil throughout tradition and even by many magicians today (and such pacts are often worded by the demons themselves) is a ref erence to the psychological mechanisms in­volved in this process, or to the <<scene of the crime', being the psyche. After all, it's com­mon knowledge that the subconscious often understands things quite literally, which we'll encounter again and again in sigil magic. But the psychological model also has the advantage of being able to make things much more easy to understand than its two pre­decessors, even though we generally use its explanations as supplemental information rather than as an independent thesis. THE INFORMATION MODEL: CYBER MAGIC Since cyber magic (the most recent branch of magic) is still in the developmental stages, it's too early to categorize it historically. Much of what currently seems to be quite promising might turn out to be nothing but an overoptimistic fallacy in the near future, although some aspects might become stronger and even more convincing. The essential fe atures of cyber magic were developed in mid-1987 by myself along with the help of a few colleagues, and since then a number of magicians have been focusing on its fu rther development. Cyber magic is based on the information model, which is currently concerned pre­dominately with physics. The term ((cyber magic'' is derived from ((cybernetics\" (control theory, from the Greek kybernetos, \"the pilot,). The thought behind this concept is that all energy, in order to be effective, requires information to ((tell'' it what to do. The magi­cian doesn't assume the energy directly, but rather the information matrices (or \"blue­prints,) that control it, and is therefore able to influence the energy much quicker, more thoroughly, and with less effort than before. Plus, ifs easier to overcome the limits of time and space since, according this model, information has neither mass nor energy and is therefore not subject to as many restrictions as these. 380 The Paradigms of Magic"},{"pageNumber":390,"pageContent":"In addition, the magician doesn't have to rely on a good relationship with spirits or other subtle entities, or on one,s own energy level. Once one has mastered the technique of downloading, transferring, and finally rcdownloading the information fo r activation, one no longer needs any imagination or concentration aids. According to the current state of research, one may not even need gnosis to perform magic effectively! But before you get too excited about this, let me warn you that practice has clearly shown that thor­ough training is still required, at least the field of controlling subtle energies (e.g., kun­dalini, activating one's own cell-memory), before you can ever hope to achieve any kind of useable results with cyber magic. At first it seemed logical to explain the effects of cyber magic with the concept of morphogenetic fields as introduced by biologist Rupert Sheldrake; but this no longer seems necessary, although the term \"information field,, is still sometimes used fo r better illustration (after all, specific terminology fo r cyber n1agic has not yet been developed). This can occasionally pose problems, however, since we're not dealing with the kind of energetic field that we,re used to in the sense of physics. A historical prototype of the information n1odel can be fo und in hon1eopathy. This system is known to work with dilution or \"potentiation., In contrast to the allopathic principle that chemically higher doses of a n1edicinc achieve better results, the home­opath prescribes chemically smaller doses in order to achieve a better healing rate under specific circumstances (appropriate clinical picture, activation by shaking). The idea be­hind this is based on the theory by Paracelsus that states that it's actually the \"spirit, of a medicine that causes healing and that this works even stronger when the \"like'' interacts with the like, and is best when the spirit of a healing substance is \"extracted, through distillation, which is exactly what occurs during the dilution/potentiation process.' This \"spirif, is fully comparable to the modern term \"information,, just like cyber n1agic or pure \"high magic,, as a whole, but of course without their ideological, mystical, and transcendental aspects. This comparison becomes obvious when you consider the fact that a cyber magician doesn't need to rely on a lot of paraphernalia, as he or she doesn't even practice ((mental magic\" because the actual act of cyber magic isn't an act of the imagination. When working with cyber magic, it's particularly important to keep in mind that all of our models already ex.isted in one fo rm or another long ago. So this isn,t a strictly hi­erarchal, chronological, stepped pyramid of development, but rather a shift in the focus The Pa radigms of Magic 381"},{"pageNumber":391,"pageContent":"that fo llows a circular or spiral pattern of movement. In the same sense, tradition has told us that old masters have always practiced some kind of\"empty hand magic.', In no way does this mean that an entirely new path has been fo rged on a practical level. In­stead, certain aspects have been filtered out of older systems, put in a different context, supplemented by new ideas, and carefully but not necessarily less revolutionary de­veloped fu rther. In a sense, this is even a traditional development since magic has always been \"stripped', and redefined throughout the course of its history. This adaptability could even be viewed as its greatest strength since th is has prevented it from suffering the fa te of disappearing from the fa ce of the earth, as many old traditions have.

However, the word «exp1ain\" is hardly possible anymore in this context. Fact is that we can describe fa irly precisely how magic works, but we still don,t really know why it works. This, of course, is a fundamen­tal problem of our fo ur-dimensional existence in which we apparently can only observe the effects, but never the causes. We'll have to delve into this problen1 more deeply when we discuss Chaos Magic; fo r now it will have to suffice when we point out that none of the earlier systems that claimed to offer a \"true explanation,, were able to stand up to a thorough investigation based on the most current state of information. This, however, doesn,t have any effect on the practical effectiveness of these systems. This requires the modern magician (who is virtually compelled to relativism) to play with one's paradigms and choose the ones that correspond best to one's needs and promise the most success. But we don,t want to dictate any dogmatic relativism here; our intention is merely to advise you to experiment with various paradigms in your practice, especially if you,re still not sure which models of explanation you personally prefer in the first place. This approach will intensify the more you become familiar with the various paradigms. In the next section we'll be discussing practical talisman magic, which will give you the opportunity to play around with the various models of illustration that we,ve intro­duced here. You,ll find more suggestions on this in the practical exercises at the end of this se ction. THE FOUR MODELS OF MAGIC USING THE EXAMPLE OF AN EXORCISM Principally, each of the fo ur paradigms of magic that we)ve discussed here can be ap­plied to any magical sphere of activity whatsoever. We,ve chosen the example of an ex­orcism in order to illustrate the various theoretical and practical approaches according to the corresponding paradigm. Technically speaking, an exorcism is the reestablishment of a desired mental-spiritual state of normality using magical means. Although this can be interpreted and handled in many different ways depending on the magical paradigm ap­plied, common language usage understands an exorcism to be the expulsion of spirits or The Para digms of Magic 383"},{"pageNumber":393,"pageContent":"demons. Lefs have a look at this phenomena using our fo ur models of magic since this will also help us learn to distinguish between the various ways of thinking. Exorcism According to the Spirit Model Case history/diagnosis: The client/patient is a victim of possession. Strange spirits and/or demons have taken possession and control of him. He's unable to get rid of them on his own, and often may not even realize the gravity of his situation. The magician evaluates the case, and begins proper treatment. Therapy: Treatment requires the magician to make the spirits/demons leave the hosfs body. This could be done with threats, fo rce, or cunning: ( 1) The magician con­jures the annoying spirits in the name of a superior authority (e.g., the hierarchy of the princes of hell) that he makes, or already has made, an agreement (or so-called pact) with, threatening them with retaliation if his demands to leave the client are not met; (2) The magician applies controlled fo rce such as hitting, torturing, or starving the host or the spirits themselves (e.g., astral warfare) and expels them; (3) The magician lures the spirits with promises, etc. out of the host and banishes them into a so-called \"spirit ,, trap. Exorcism According to the Energy Model Case history/diagnosis: The client/patient is a victim of unbalanced energy. Foreign ener­gies or excess energies of his own have taken control of him, destroyed his energetic bal­ance and are now in full control. He's unable to reestablish this balance on his own, and often may not even realize the cause of his suffering. The magician evaluates the case, and begins proper treatment. Therapy: The magician extracts excess energy from the clienfs organism and ban­ishes it (especially in cases of aggressive energies directed at the client by an opponent) into an energy storage medium (spirit trap). When energy is lacking, he transfers some to the client. Basically, he harmonizes the organism's balance of energy. Exorcism According to the Psychological Model Case history/diagnosis: The client/patient is a vi ctim of a psychological disturbance. Re­pressed dark sides of his psyche have taken control of him in the fo rm of projections, 384 The Paradigms of Magic"},{"pageNumber":394,"pageContent":"have destroyed his psychological balance and are now in fu ll control; this can even take the fo rm of split personalities. He's unable to reestablish this balance on his own, and often n1ay not even realize the cause of his suffering. The magician evaluates the case, and begins proper treatment. Therapy: The magician treats the client psychotherapeutically (e.g .. shock therapy, mimicry of the client's behavior, ritual death initiation, or the like) with magical means in order to help him withdraw his magically effective projections and/or banish them. In doing so, he may apply a symbolic projection storage medium («spirit trap,). In addi­tion, he ensures that the client is now able to express previously repressed drives and de­sires in order to prevent a relapse. Exorcism According to the Information Model Case history/diagnosis: The client/patient is a victim of confused information. His ener­getic balance is thrown off course due to inherent or externally induced faulty circuits within his biocybernetic memory, which can result in a total loss of energy, as well as in hallucinations, psychosomatic problems and personality disorders. The client is unable to restore the fu nctionality of his biocybernetic memory on his own, and may often not even realize that his condition is abnormal. The magician evaluates the case, and begins proper treatment. Therapy: Treatment consists of a three-part operation: ( 1) By means of information transfer, the magician activates his client's physical and mental defense n1echanisms as well as the ability to completely restore the memory; (2) He implants an infomagical \"DELETE\" command into the client in order to delete the destructive information and defect memory; (3) He establishes (also by means of information transfer) an infomag­ical, preventive alarm system to help recognize undesired information as soon as it's re­ceived so that it can be deleted or rendered useless by means of an activation block (so­called \"information traps\") or mutilation. These fo ur approaches reflect the great diversity of modern magic. In this sense, we could even mention a fifth paradigm of magic, namely the synthetic model that unites all fo ur previous (and possibly later ones as well) models in a pragmatic sense (\"the truth is what works',). We'll mention that again when we discuss the paradigms of magic in more detail. The Paradigms of Magic 385"},{"pageNumber":395,"pageContent":"SPIRIT TRAPS Apart from cyber magic, which as already mentioned doesn't require any parapher­nalia, aU paradigms of magic use the so-called \"spirit traps'' fo r exorcisms as mentioned above. These are magically charged objects that represent a sort of prison fo r undesired spirits/energies/projections. This is based on the idea that ifs not a good idea to sin1ply rid the client or patient of these spirits/energies/projections. Instead, they should be banished, or bound and brought under the control of the magician's will so they,re no longer able to get free and cause more damage . • The spirit trap often functions as a channel or entranceway that's used to transport the undesired spirits/energies/projections into another sphere (e.g., \"into chaos,, \"into the sun'', etc.), with the intention of either destroying them there or distracting them and sending them into exile. Due to its concave fo rm, the magic mirror is particularly suited for absorbing. Usu­ally ifs round as weU, and in any case it's enclosed in a frante that makes it the perfect trap in a symbol-logical sense. This is why a magic mirror is often attached to the client's body, or at least pointed in one,s direction; then the magician can extract the undesired spirits/energies/projections by means of wiU and imagination. In both the spirit model and the psychological model, it's generally necessary to talk to and negotiate with the possessing spirits or externally manifested projections. That's why it may take a great deal of cunning and promises before the magician can coax them out of the patient's body and lure them into the trap. From what we've said, ifs obvious that exorcism operations require a great deal of experience, skill, and even courage on the part of the magician, and one must be willing to risk one,s own physical and spiritual health, and even one's 1ife as well. Because in the same way the human or­ganism is capable of performing incredible magical things when properly instructed and trained, one can also mobilize unimaginably damaging powers if one loses control, which might be caused, fo r example, by a specific external influence (e.g., magical attack de­signed to hurt or kill) or an \"internal short circuit, (e.g., mental disorders, which on the other hand could also be a result of a magical attack as well). In a sense, an exorcism can be compared to magical warfare; the magician should therefore approach it accordingly. Once the spirit trap is \"filled,\" the question arises as to what the magician should do with the spirits/energies/projections that it contains. The answer depends on which 386 The Pa radigms of Magic i"},{"pageNumber":396,"pageContent":"model one uses. Spirits are usually either banished, as already explained, or the rnagician tries to make them submit so that one can use them fo r one,s own purposes. Energies are usually stored, especially when dealing with offensive energies from a n1agical oppo­nent, since these are particularly suited fo r defensive operations or retaliation, because no healthy person is immune to one's own energies. But often these energies are magi­cally neutralized and returned to the general cosmic energy flow. Only in exceptional cases are the spirits/energies/projections kept trapped inside the magic mirror permanently; after all, the mirror should be able to fulfill its ((normal\" pur­pose again after the exorcisrn. It therefore serves mainly as an instrument of extraction and intermediate storage, and after a successful operation the captured spirits/ener­gies/projections are put into a final prison, such as a stone or preferably a rock crystal (which is highly appreciated by some practitioners due to its great storage capacity). Or­dinary table or rock salt can also be used in an en1ergency as a temporary solution­which is why the magic circle is often reinforced with salt, such as in Voodoo, or why salt is added to holy water by the Catholic Church, and why many traditional witches refuse to consume any kind of salt at all. Since salt is strongly hygroscopic, meaning that it ab­sorbs water and will dissolve (e.g., in rain), it can only be used as a temporary prison. A common way to bind spirits is to trap them in a bottle. This is where the term ((genie in a bottle'' came from. We know several magicians who are specialized in cap­turing spirits and energies in bottles and storing then1 this way. In doing so, the impor­tant thing to remember symbol-logically is to always keep the bottle sealed tightly, and using ordinary cork is not enough an additional seal of beeswax is generally used and engraved with the corresponding seals and sigils of defense. 1. This, of course, doesn't exclude the possibility of transferring power additionally. This is just one exam­ple of the simplification mentioned at the beginning of this section. 2. This also includes pseudo-energy models such as Coueism and positive thinking. 3. Paracelsus' frequently quoted concept of similia similibus curcultur is often incorrectly translated as '<identjcals are cured by identicals.n However, the correct translation is ''likes are cured by likes,•' which is an interesting parallel to sy mpathetic n1agic and the correspondences!

We 've mentioned these utensils several times throughout the course of this book and now want to deal with them in more depth. The layn1an usually uses the terms \"talisman'' and \"amulet\" interchangeably, and makes little or no distinction between the two. The modern magician is different.1 As we've already seen, the magician uses specific vocabulary in order to describe one's art in all aspects as precisely as possible, and there­fore makes a distinction between various charged objects according to their corre­sponding function. This is why you should memorize the following common definitions as well: Talismans: Magically charged objects used to fu lfill a specific purpose or achieve a certain goal. Amulets: Magically charged objects used to prevent a certain condition or situation. Fetishes: Magically charged and activated objects used fo r storing energies and in op­erations of magical influence. Now let's have a look at each of these magical tools individually. To put it short, a good way to describe them is to say that talismans are \"for\" something and amulets are to 389"},{"pageNumber":399,"pageContent":"\"prevent, something. For example, we could make a talisman \"for good health,)) and charge an amulet \"to prevent sickness.\" A fetish, on the other hand, can assume both functions, but is generally used as a magical battery or psychogon, which we'U discuss in more detail shortly. In general, talismans, amulets, and fetishes can all be charged with any type of en­ergy, for all purposes, and using any preferred magical technique thafs suitable. But let's use planetary magic (Venus energy) as our first example to illustrate this. THE VENUS TA LISMAN A Venus talisman is an object charged with Venus energy thafs utilized to achieve Venu­sian goals (energy model). Lefs stick to the most common correspondences based on the Golden Dawn (and, in part, on much older sources). According to these, a Venus tal­isman would ideally be made of a piece of copper and engraved with the sigils of Venus. This piece of copper would then be charged ceren1onially during a Venus ritual. The Venus talisman should be heptagonal, and the engravings should be green. It should be made on a Friday during the hour ruled by Venus/ During charging, the magician usually enters a Venus trance during a Venus ritual. At the climax of the ritual, the talisman (already engraved and marked with, for ex­ample, a sigil of a statement of intent) is charged by the magician who spasmodically projects a green ray of light into the material basis (also called materia prima or \"MP,) by using one's hands (which, of cou.rse, will only be done imaginatively at first), and then by drawing the traditional Venus glyphs over it. According to the usual procedure, the magician will concentrate on the intended goal while charging it, although contemporary Chaos Magic recommends not thinking about the goal at all while charging. But good resuJts can certainly be achieved with the traditional method. Once ies charged, the talisman is either worn for a while on the body or always kept at hand. Another techn ique is to put it away in a safe place and forget about it. THE VENUS AMULET A Venus amulet is an object charged with Venus energy that's utilized to prevent Venu­sian influences. Everything said about the Venus talisman applies here as well, but we 390 Practical Ta lisman Magic"},{"pageNumber":400,"pageContent":"need to add one important thing. Although the Venus amulet (like every other kind of amulet) principally has a negative goal (such as avoidance, prevention, blocking, and so on), the statement of intent must be fo rmulated positively when charged (e.g., with a corresponding sigil). For example, if you want to use a Ve nus amulet to prevent a rela­tionship fro m breaking up, you wouldn't say \"This amulet is to prevent my relationship with X from breaking up,'' but rather '(This amulet will protect my relationship to X from breaking up)) or something similar. In the field of magical warfare, the necessity of amulets becomes even clearer. After all, you could also protect the relationship to X from external disturbances. And this fact is exactly the reason why many authors even today still confuse talismans and amulets. THE VENUS FETISH Experienced magicians might sharpen their ears when they hear this term since the old We stern tradition never mentions it. We,re usually only familiar with fe tishes in connec­tion with so-called ((primitive, cultures, and ethnologists generally view <'fetishism'' as an animistic nature religion. But the basic concept of a fetish is not at all as (( un-Western\" as it might seem at first . .. fhe word ((fetish,, is derived from the French word fe tiche and the Portuguese word fe iti(O, and merely means some type of magical object. In general, fe tishes are typically animated objects that are charged specifically to serve the magician as semi-autonomous entities. In contrast to psychogons, or artificially created magical creatures that mainly work on the astral plane but are tied to the material plane through their physical consis­tency, an external fe tish object is a true source of a certain power, deity, entity or some­thing similar. At the same time, however, they are identical. A fe tish also needs to be fed, cared fo r, and talked to. This continuous procedure actually helps charge them in the first place. Some magicians report that they can even develop a personality and life of their own throughout the course of tin1e. For example, poltergeist activities might occur in their presence, or the fe tish may independently \"take a trip, on its own and reappear entirely unexpectedly (and just as unexplainably as it disappeared) in unusual places. Although fe tishes are embodiments of certain powers, they're rarely animated for very specific, personalized purposes. In this sense, general healing fe tishes are common, but they're rarely created for healing a specific person. Instead, they continue to live even Practical Ta lisman Magic 391"},{"pageNumber":401,"pageContent":"after the patient is healed and can then help others as well. In this sense, the fetish is tied to a certain purpose, not to a certain person. It can be compared to a common battcry.3 A Venus fetish, for example, would be comparable to a general Venus talisman, or even better to a Venus pentacle. Like the pentacle, the Venus fetish could be used for every Venus operation in order to intensify the energy without actually having to be physically present or specifically directed at the target. From now on, we)lJ be referring to planetary fetishes as pentacles, and use the general term ''fetish>' for all other appropriately charged tools. Please keep in mind that we're not talking about the Earth pentacle that we men­tioned earlier! This type of pentacle is more similar to the lamen, except that it's not worn on the chest it's more of a mixture of the two as we'll often find mentioned in literature. If necessary, reread the sections of this book that explain these things to make sure the difference is truly clear. In addition to the techniques already mentioned, a fetish is usually animated with blood, sperm, menstruation blood, or other bodily secretions of the magician as well, and is almost always made entirely by hand. It will often resemble a human or animal, but there are also fetishes that are co·mpletely abstract and have no recognizable shape and form. African fetishes often resemble a feather duster but can be n1ade of various materials ranging from wood and leather, to metal, wax, rags, or straw. The fetish can be used to charge other objects, or can at least help in doing so. In Western ceremonial planetary magic, this function is fulfilled by the pentacle (once again, we don,t mean the earth pentacle!), which we've mentioned quite frequently al· ready. To charge objects (generally talismans and amulets, but also brand-new magical weapons), they're placed on the pentacle to help charge them according to the principles of sympathetic magic. Both talismans and amulets are often made for other people, while fetishes are gen­erally used only by the magician oneself (of course, with the exception of charging one for a client). In practice, you,ll soon understand the difference between these three cate­gories of magical utensils, and in the practical exercises at the end of this section you'll find more recommendations on how to work with these. 392 Practical Ta lisman Magic"},{"pageNumber":402,"pageContent":"A FEW TRADITIONAL TA LISMANS AND AMULETS In the course of our lesson on practical talisman magic, we don't want to restrict our­selves to just planetary talismans and amulets according to the Golden Dawn. For this reason, we'll discuss some traditional examples that you'll run into again and again in n1agicalliterature. a) ABRACADABRA. This is one of the oldest talisn1ans known. It was even men­tioned back in ancient times. The gnostic Quintus Serenus San1monicus recom­mended it fo r conjuring good spirits and as an amulet to prevent fe ver in his book on medicinal home remedies that was used throughout the Middle Ages. The meaning of the word itself is still disputed. The range of interpretations in­cludes ((a mutilation of the Gnostic god-name Abraxas,, and \"an acrostic (notari­con) of the Hebrew phrase AB BEN RUACH AKADOSH, (''Father, Son, Holy Spirit\"). But even the Te murah rearrangement of the letters to read ((ABRA KAD BARA\"('<fever,) might be possible, just as ((ABRA KADABRA\" could be inter­preted to mean ((sickness disappear,'' while another theory sees it as a distortion of «ABBADA KEDABRA'' (\"disappear like this word\"). Since Greek an1ulets usually spell the word as ((ABRACADABPA,, ifs possible that the original word was pro­nounced as <'abrasadabra., We should also mention that A)eister Crowley made it his '<Word of the Aeon\" after changing it to '<ABRAHADABRN, in order to give it the significant gematric value 418. b) Kabbalistic an1ulets fron1 Rabbi Hama. Agrippa wrote: t(But Rabbi Ham a in his book of speculation delivereth a sacred seal rrzore effi ca cious [than the Abracadabra amulet} against any diseases of man, or any griefe s whatsoever, in whose fo reside are the fo ur squared natnes of God, so subordinated to one another in a square, that fro m the highest to the lowest those most holy names or seales of the God­head do arise, whose intention is inscribed in the circumferential circle, but on the backside is inscribed the seven-lettered name Araritha, and his in terpretation is written about, viz. the verse from which it is extracted, even as you see it here described.

One such example has the front side containing the first ]etters of the first five verses of Genesis, while the reverse side contains the last letters of the same verses, which together arc a ((representation of the creation of the world.\" Please pay close attention to the elegant syn1bol-logic applied here. The First Book of Moses is the same as Genesis, which contains the biblical story of creation, so that the entire \"creation of the world, is actually represented here fo r magical use with just ten letters. This kabbalistic amulet grants that the wearer t(shaiJ be free from all mischiefes, if so be that he firmly believeth in God the cre­ator of aU things\" (Agrippa). It protects \"against the affrightments and mischief of evil spirits and men, and what dangers soever, either of journey, waters, enemies, arms.\" d) Christian «victory,, or success talisman with the well-known symbol fo r Chrisfs name (the Chi-Ro) and the Latin words \"in hoc vince, ('<In this [symbol], con­quer,). This type of talisman was often imitated by Hebrew amulet makers. e) Pentagra1n talisman with the inscription ''igira,, which basically means \"healthy,, or \"for good health., The frequency of Bible quotations generally Hebrew, but occasionally taken from Vulgar Latin contained on amulets and talismans in ancient times, Middle Ages, and the Renaissance is not just due to the predomi­nance of the Christian church, but more so to the fa ct that the Bible was viewed as an excellent example of a talisman/amulet/fetish itself, such as the Jewish To rah, the Muslim Koran, and even the ancient Egyptian Pe rt-em-hru. Since such scriptures of revelation are considered divine and therefore magical by defin­ition, ifs logical to view them as a treasure chest of surefire fo rmulas. Often the \"Good Book, itself was used as a magical defense simply by holding it up at un­ruly spirits and demons in the same way Christian exorcisms do with the cross, which is also a type of fe tish in a magical sense. 394 Practical Ta lisman Magic"},{"pageNumber":404,"pageContent":"ENGRAVING TA LISMANS AND AMULETS To wrap things up, here,s a practical tip. Metal engravings can either be made manually or by using special engraving tools of various sizes, and even electric engraving tools can be purchased in certain craft stores. Electric tools have the advantage of requiring con­siderably less physical strength to use them, although it takes practice to learn how to draw clear lines. This kind of tool actually makes a dotted Jine (if not drawn too deeply) that's made up of lots of tiny, litt le dots. The tip of the too) is often interchangeable, and by attaching a diamond tip, you can even engrave glass and other especially hard objects (e.g., semiprecious stones). It would be best to purchase a fe w cheap copper plates (such as those used for enameling) at the craft store as well so that you can practice engraving for a while. Another relatively simple means of inscription is etching. This is done by first cover­ing the surface of the metal with a coating of shellac or thick wax. After the coating is dry, the desired symbols are carved into it. The carvings, of course, must be deep enough to go through the entire outer coating, but not scratch the surface of the metal. Afterward, acid is poured over the surface. The disadvantage of this method is that the etched lines are usually blurred and un­clear, depending on the adhesiveness of the coating. Plus, working with acid can be dan­gerous and cause unpleasant odors, which is why most magicians generally prefer the method of engraving.

But if you're already fa miliar with cyber magic from other sources, feel free to use this model now as well. Shift to a different para­digm (e.g., from the energy to spirit model, or from a \"mixed, form to a \"pure, paradigm) for at least two weeks {reference value that should be viewed as a minimum, although more practice is actually desired), and observe all of your magical activities from this new point of view. Try as best as you can with the means you have available {knowledge, tools) to perform several magical operations that you're already fa miliar with, but by applying this new paradigm.

It's relatively young, officially fo unded in the year 1978 by Peter J. Carroll upon publication of the first edi­tion his book Liber Null. This book hit the British magic scene literally like a bomb. Following the somewhat amateurishly designed first edition of just 100 copies that was only available as an inter­nal publication of the I.O.T., a second edition soon fo Jlowed that quickly achieved the status of a cult book, and a third edition was soon after released by Sorcerer,s Apprentice in Leeds.

This edition was quite small as well, as only 150 copies were printed, of which about 130 actually made it in to stores. Later, a third German edition was pub­lished (on license from Weiser publishers), while the German sequel Psychonautik was published in 1984 in a total of two editions. (Both German titles are now out of print and no longer available from Edition Magus.) But a wide number of magazine articles published mainly in England and Germany were probably even more significant than these two books concerning the number of readers they reached, and they certainly helped popularize this current trend within the tradition of magic.

[. .. J\" Well, let's start with an introduction taken from Psychonaut itself. THE CHAOETHERIC PARADIGM The manife st universe is just a tiny island of comparative order, set in an infinite ocean of primal Chaos or potentia. Moreover, that limitless chaos pervades every in­terstice of our island of order. This island of order was randomly spewed up out of chaos and will eventually be redissolved into it. Although this universe is a highly un­likely event, it was bound to occur eventually. We ourselves are the most highly ordered structure known on that island, yet in the very center of our being is a spark of that same chaos which gives rise to the illusion of this universe. It is this spark of chaos that animates us and allows us to work magic. We ca nnot perceive Chaos directly, fo r it si­multaneously contains the opposite to anything we might think it is. We can, however, Introduction to Chaos Magic 401"},{"pageNumber":411,"pageContent":"occasionally glimpse and make use of partially fo rmed matter, which has only a prob­abilistic and indeterminate existence. Th is stuff we can call the aethers. If it makes us fe el any better we can call this Chaos, the Ta o, or God, and imagine it to be benevolent and human-hearted. There are two schools of thought in magic. One considers the fo rmative agent of the universe to be random and chaotic, and the other considers that it is a fo rce of spiritual consciousness. As they have only them­selves on which to base their speculations, they are basically saying that their own na­tures are either random and chaotic or spiritually conscious. Myself, I am inclined to the view that my spiritual consciousness is random and chaotic in an agreeable sort of way (pp. 192- 193 ). This is Peter Carroll talking to us, who's also responsible fo r the fact that Chaos Magic joined close fo rces with the Zos Kia cult of Austin Osman Spare. Carroll and Sherwin assumed some of Spare's terminology, such as the ((spark of chaos, quoted above thafs described as uKia.'' In Sherwin's Theatre of Magic, Kia is described as «soul; individuality without ego,, (p. 32), while Liber Null defines it as ((nascent energy seeking form'' (p. 60), or as '(Great Desire,\" ((Life Force,, or even «Self-Love.\" ((It can be repre­sented by Atu (trump) 0, the Ta rot Fool, or the Joker. Its heraldic beast is the vulture, for it ever descends to take its satisfaction among the living and the dead, (ibid.). <<IGa can­not be experienced directly,, Carroll explains in another passage, \"because it is the basis of consciousness (or experience), and it has no fixed qualities which the mind can latch on to. Kia is the consciousness, it is the elusive 'r which confers self-awareness but does not seem to consist of anything itself. Kia can sometimes be fe lt as ecstacy or inspiration, but it is deeply buried in the dualistic mind. It is mostly trapped in the aimless wander­ings of thought and in identification with experience and in that cluster of opinions about ourselves called ego. Magic is concerned with giving the Kia more freedom and flexibility and with providing means by which it can n1anifest its occult power)) (p. 28). Kia therefore is impersonal which is an important fa ct · and it has nothing to do with the common, Christian-based definition of the ((soul.,, Although we can recognize parallels (which Carroll incredulously mentioned himself) to the Tao of Chinese philos­ophy and the early Buddhist concept of the incarnation of karma (but not the individu­ality of the living being), and even to the Paramatman of Hinduism and the \"cosmic consciousness,, of some yoga and Jnana schools, one should avoid getting carried away • 402 Introduction to Chaos Magic"},{"pageNumber":412,"pageContent":"with comparisons a mistake that even Aleister Crowley made in one of his first com­mentaries on Spare,s Book of Pleasure that he later regretted as he reread through it. Kia just isn,t the exact same thing as Ta o, Kamma, or Atman, although it may be related to these. The Egyptian concept of Ka comes closer yet, and may even resemble it more than any of the others, but ifs still not the exact same thing. Carroll stresses that such termi­nology is purely random and, at best, has merely a functional value. Kia is the point of intersection between chaos and the matter it created for its own \"amusement.\" Chaos Magic doesn)t recognize an individual soul thafs given to a person at birth, or one that may continually incarnate whether it wants to or not. In this sense, it resembles Gurdjieff's system, which also assumed that man has to earn his soul. In Psychonaut, Carroll wrote: A curious error has entered into many systems of occult thought. This is the notion of· some higher self or true will which has been misappropriated from the monotheistic religions. There are many who like to think that they have some inner self which is somehow more rea l or sp iritual than their ordinary or lower self. The fa cts do not bear this out. There is no part of one's beliefs about oneself which cannot be modified by sufficiently powerfu l psychological techniques. There is nothing about oneself which cannot be taken away or changed. The proper stimuli can, if correctly applied, turn co mmunists into fa scists, saints into devils, the meek into heroes, and vice-versa. Th ere is no sovereign sanctuary within ourselves which represents our real nature. There is nobody at home in the internal fo rtress. Everything we cherish as our ego, everything we believe in, is just what we have cobbled together out of the accident of our birth and subsequent experiences. Wi th drugs, brainwashing, and other techniques of ex­treme persuasion, we can quite readily make a man a devotee of a different ideology, the patriot of a different country, or the fo llower of a different religion. Our mind is just an extension of the body, and there is no part of it which cannot be taken away or modified. The only part of ourselves which exists above the temporary and mutable psycho­logical structure we call the ego is the Kia. Kia is the deliberately meaningless term given to the vital spark or life fo rce within us. The Kia is without fo rm. It is neither this nor that (p. 164).

Through this, Chaos Magic (surely influenced by the individual anarchy of Max Stirner and Nietzsche) almost incidentally gains an immense political, lif elong char­acteristic: If the magician truly wants to be free, he has to free himself from all chains. These chains include patterns of thought, behavior and belief as well as imbedded emotional structures and urges. This process, of course, is deeply amoral: Since there is nothing absolute in the conventional sense of the word, the initiate has the entire world at his fe et. Here we can see a clear point of contact with the Discordia Move­ment as well, whose motto, attributed to the assassin boss Hassan ben Sabbah (the \"Old Man of the Mountain,\" reads: \"Nothing is true, everything is permitted.\" A sen­tence, by the way, that didn,t first appear with Robert Anton Wilson and his fo llowers, but actually much earlier with pre ... hippie author William S.

These self-descriptions are often worded quite apodeictic and absolute, but in practice, it's usually much more moderate. In fa ct, a Chaos magician can be a Crowleyan Thelemite or even a practicing Christian, Odinist, reincarnationalist, or transcendentalist. But Chaos Magic developed out of the above-mentioned ideological movements, and many modern magical techniques and practices stem from them as well. But first the old monuments need to be removed in order to prevent their shadows from permanently smothering the growth of creativity, originality, and technology as well as philosophical progress. The magical order called the IDuminates ofThanateros, which developed around Chaos Magic and is now officially known as the Magical Pact of the Illuminates of Thanateros (or ((The PacC'), quickly became an active melting pot of international magical talent . 404 Introduction to Chaos Magic •"},{"pageNumber":414,"pageContent":"By 2001, the Chaos Magic movement has experienced struggles and separation.

All movements of energy in the entire universe are controlled by information. 2. Information has no mass or energy. It is therefore nonlocaJ by definition and can spread/move fa ster than the speed of light. 3. With the help of cyber-magical techniques, it is possible to manipulate informa­tion, meaning that it can be retrieved, transferred, copied, deleted, and activated. This occurs through the manipulation of the central information memory in hun1an, animal, mineral, and mechanical organisms. Since information has no mass or energy, it cannot be stopped by material barriers from being spread or transferred. The only way to cause such a hindrance is to specifically in­fluence the information's transmitter or receiver. In this case, the transferred information itself remains unaffected by the hindrance; instead, an error code is emitted that will cause erratic results. This transfer of information is similar to the copying of one data memory into an­other. In contrast to the energy model, no energy is lost (e.g., by the transmitter) since the information is merely duplicated. In this way, information about, fo r example, a fo r­eign language can be transferred from A to B without either of the participants having 407"},{"pageNumber":417,"pageContent":"to exert any significant amount of energy. The only thing required of both organisn1s is a n1inimum level of energetic performance, which is necessary fo r survival anyway (so­called ((back-up generator',). If this condition is fuJfilled, nothing can prevent the trans-fe r of information when trained properly. · Lefs take healing, for example. According to cyber magic,s oldest model of explana­tion, the healer generates a morphogenetic field where the patient is healthy and lets this field do the job of \"establishing\" the patienfs recovery. According to the current state of knowledge, it would be even more effective for the healer to project/copy the con1mand or (to be more exact) the concept of«health, into the patienfs memory. If this is done successfully, the cyber-magical transfer of information to the patient creates a new energy matrix that assimilates its own energies as well as foreign ones that enter from the outside. This energy matrix can also be described as a (( health pattern.\" However, if the patient has an acute lack of energy, one should definitely be given addi­tional energy according to the energy model since a cyber magical transfer takes time to work and become effective. 1 The transfer of matrices seems to be the most prominent feature of this practice any­way. In the exan1ple already mentioned of transfe rring the knowledge of a foreign lan­guage, it's not really the concrete vocabulary and grammar ruJes that are later activated by the receiver; instead, the transfer can be noticed when linguistic patterns of experi­ence are suddenly activated.2 The best results thus far have indeed been achieved in the fieid of fo reign language transfer. But cyber magic can also be used quite eff ectively fo r magical healing, the transfer of any kind of knowledge, and the intentional influencing of others. It seems to be predominately guide patterns that are transferred, which act in a certain sense like «blueprints'' or ((building plans.', This has certain advantages and disadvantages. The disadvantages include the fa ct that cyber-magical operations often do not take immediate effect, as mentioned above, although they can be performed quite quickly (depending on the magician,s ability, sometimes just a split second). Plus, the results are often \"blurry,, and even more diffi­cult to ascertain than those of ordinary operations. One n1ore drastic disadvantage is the fa ct that once inforn1ation is assimilated by means of foreign influence, it's extremely difficult and sometimes impossible to locate, and it can almost never be deleted.3 The advantages include that the overwriting and deletion of undesired patterns by new, desired matrices in a target person often have a much longer lasting effect than 408 Introduction to Cy ber Magic"},{"pageNumber":418,"pageContent":"would be possible by using the energy model. To put it more clearly, we do not simply change a factory,s flow of energy or its speed of production; instead we give it entirely new production schedules and progran1s while leaving the factory,s own internal energy balance untouched. Furthermore, cyber-magical operations generally remain unde­tected. That immediately becomes clear when we remember that information has no mass or energy, and therefore also has no material resistors (e.g., inner sensors) that it might activate. In any case, we can recognize when an information transfer has taken place by the reaction of our organism,s own physical memory (<'hard drive mainte­nance,\" often perceived as a burning or prickling sensation in the spinal colun1n), al­though we wouldn,t be able to specify it any further.

Basically, there doesn,t seem to be any area at all where cyber magic cannot be applied. TECHNIQUES OF TRANSFERRING INFORMATION Currently, one specific technique of transferring information has proven quite effective to cyber magic. It requires the activation of both central memories in the human organ­ism: the brain and spinal cord. Of course, the organism has many other memories, but experience has shown that specifically activating these two large ones is most effective. Cyber-magica) operations generally proceed according to the fo llowing scheme: Activating the brain and spinal column of the transmitter ' retrieving information • • transmtttmg • • recetvtng ' I activating the information received I Chart 23: Outline of a cyber-magical operation 410 Introduction to Cyber Magic '"},{"pageNumber":420,"pageContent":"In the following that explains the individual steps of a cyber-magical operation, we,d like to use the example of two computers communicating with one another (which most computer literates should understand) in order to illustrate the technical aspects of how it works. If you have no knowledge about computers, feel free to skip over this section. ACTIVATING THE BRAIN AND SPINAL COLUMN The beginner is easily tempted to view the activation of the brain and spinal column (the so-called \"golf club chakra',) as a sort of visualization technique. This wrong idea is probably caused by the fa ct that activation usually does indeed occur at first (during the training phase) with the help of the appropriate visualization. But in fa ct, it has nothing to do with a visualization technique. In the same way the acupuncture meridians more or less (depending on the system) ((objectively, exist and can even be measured without the person having to know that they exist, the activation of these two main men1ories of the human organism takes place on a more-or-less physiological level as well. Cybcr magicians generally sense this as a warm or cold sensation, or a tingly or itchy feeling. lf the transfer is made actively, the cyber magician activates one,s own memory. The target person doesn't need to do anything at all; the transfer can even take place without his or her knowing. Currently, there seems to be no means of protection against this either. On the other hand, if the cyber magician wants to extract information from some­one, one first activates the memories of the target person with a mental command to transmit, and then receives the desired information into one's own memory without having to do anything else. Illustration using the computer model: This process is similar to turning on a com­puter, or activating and checking its operating system (so-called ''booting,'). Retrieving Information Retrieving information generally occurs by merely stating the name of the desired data, e.g., ((knowledge of English., This occurs purely mentally and requires no further visualization. Introduction to Cyber Magic 411"},{"pageNumber":421,"pageContent":"Illustration using the computer model: This is similar to calling up a directory and a file, e.g., ucd/sourcedir/sourcefile') in the UNIX world. Transmitting Using an older method, transmission would take place by directing the retrieved infor­mation to the spinal column and brain and on to the sahasrara chakra (\"crown chakra,,, the \"thousand-petal lotus,) in order to be \"shot out\" in a sense by a mental transmission command. One variety of this technique involves giving a mental command to create a morphogenetic field in the crown chakra where the desired information is already lo­cated or the desired event has already occurred. This morphogenetic field is then as­signed the actual task of transmitting. The currently most common technique doesn,t rely on any kind of visualization of the crown chakra, but still works with the spatial perception of the crown. Then a sim­ple command (e.g., \"transmit!,) is given without any conscious visualization of the transmission. Illustration using the computer model: This is similar to the \"COPY, command, e.g., \"copy q:\\sourcedir\\sourcefile z:'' whereby \"q, represents one,s own drive and «z,, the tar­get drive. The crown works like a modem in a normal dial .. up network. The ability to store the transmitted data into a specific part of the target drive (e.g., \"copy z:\\source\\ sourcefile z:\\targetdir\\targetfile\" ) requires exact knowledge of its construction and is there­fore currently just a thing of the future. Receiving Receiving is similar to transmitting. For more information, see the next two sections below. Processing the Information Received Processing received information is done automatically at first, and experienced cyber magicians generally sense this in the spinal column in the same way as with transmit­ting. Untrained people generally sense nothing at aU. For more information, see the section below on <'Retrieving Cyber-Magically Trans­mitted Information.\" 412 Introduction to Cyber Magic"},{"pageNumber":422,"pageContent":"The transmitter sometimes perceives the arrival of data in the memory of the target person as a small physical jolt of the scalp, a soft tingling sensation, or something simi­lar. Even without such physical signals, when done properly, the magician will receive certain clear signals to confirm the success of one,s operation. This applies accordingly as well to the specific extraction (and therefore, reception) of information. Illustration using the computer model: The immediate processing of data is similar to the automatic sorting and compressing done by a hard drive, which arranges everything in a certain order but does not yet enable access to it. Despite this detailed description of a cyber-magical operation, remember that the entire process generaUy takes no longer than three quarters of a second! Even inexperi­enced beginners (although they must be able to activate kundalini) can usuaUy perform cyber-magical operations in less than half a minute! Retrieving Cyber-Magically Transmitted Information How can the cyber-magically transmitted information be activated? This area still re­quires intense research; even though there,s no doubt that retrievable information can actually be transmitted, we're still faced with the challenge of how we can accurately put this knowledge to use. One of the main problems is not knowing exactly what is transmitted. The effect it brings about is often quite vague. One cyber magician commented, <'It feels like some­thing that was learned a very long time ago.\" In this sense, transferring the knowledge of a fo reign language, fo r example, would make it considerably easier to learn this lan­guage. If knowledge of the foreign language is already available, the newly acquired in­formation is activated through the appropriate contextualization. This can occur, for ex­ample, during a trip to the corresponding country where the transferred language is spoken, or, fo r a dead language, while reading more literature in that language. According to our current state of knowledge, one of the most significant factors that can influence the specific retrieval of information is stress, for example, being under pressure to suddenly have to communicate in a foreign country can quickly activate this information. In general, the contextuatization already mentioned also plays a significant role. The newly acquired information must be retrieved with in the appropriate external or internal Introduction to Cyber Magic 413"},{"pageNumber":423,"pageContent":"context. Therefore, there would be no point in trying to retrieve French vocabulary while studying math or repairing a car. A great deal of the information transferred is revealed quite subtly over a period of time. ThaCs why ifs always important to observe yourself closely when controlling the results of an experiment. Illustration using the computer model: Before activating the information, such as the knowledge of a fo reign language, you should be aware that you've received the transn1it­ter,s pattern of language experience, which is the main program in a sense. Even the other related modules (e.g., vocabulary, syntax, idiomology) are available in a compre­hensive (or undifferentiated) transfer, but they still need to be properly installed. Since the methods of transfer currently available are still relatively primitive, a great part of retrieving the information consists of, figuratively speaking, separating and log­ically organizing the files, directories, clusters, and sector allocations on a hard drive that's quite cluttered with information and programs. However, the law of adaptation can help (a similar process is currently being devel­oped in the field of artificial intelligence). An addition to already stored information\" causes the old info rmation to combine with the new, thus creating a new file structure (or an already existing one is reactivated and maintained). Apart from the data compar­ison, this automaticaUy leads to increased access speed. However, this is an automatic process thafs immanent to the information cybernetic \"operating system, of the human biocon1puter, a process that resetnbles those in common computer applications as well. Cyber Magic as an \"Empty Hand Technique\" This short introduction should suffice to give you a working basis that will allow you to make your own experiences with this modern discipline of magic. The advantages of cyber-magical operations are clear. Not onJy the short duration of the process is attractive, but also the complete abandonment of any type of equipment; the sheer effectiveness of cyber-magical operations especially in the field of transferring experience and knowledge; their long-lasting effect; their enormous subtlety and thor­oughness while at the same time being completely disguised from the outside; and much more. In fa ct, cybcr magic is actually a sort of \"empty hand technique,' (((wishful thinking without thinking',), which has always been the sign of a true master.

The so­called \"high magic\" that older literature makes such a fuss about is actually once you wipe away all of its religious transcendentalism a form of pure information transfer.

But remember, as easy as cyber magic is to use, it nonetheless requires previous knowledge of how to activate the main memory in the human biocomputer.

Not all modern magicians follow Crowley,s path, even though they may respect and appreciate him as a pioneer and \"father of modern magic.\" And surely they won,t submit to his dictum either, such as: \"Unless therefore the Magician be first anointed with this Oil, all his work will be wasted and evil,, (ibid.). At least Therion gives a recipe for his magic oil, although he doesn't state any quan­tities. It consists of four substances. The basis is olive oil, which Crowley views as the gift of Minerva, the Wisdom of God, the logos; three other oils are mixed with this oil, namely the oils of myrrh, cinnamon, and galangal. Myrrh symbolizes Binah, the Great Mother, which represents both the understanding of the magician as well as the sorrow and compassion that result from one's contemplation of the universe (a clear Buddhist influence on the part of Crowley). Cinnamon oil symbolizes Tiphareth, the Sun \"the Son, in whom glory and suffe ring are identical\" (ibid.). The galangal oil symbolizes both <<Kether and Malkuth, the First and the Last, the One and the Many, since in this Oil they are One', (ibid.). In our opinion, the value of these statements lies mainly in the fa ct that they show how to symbolically elevate even the most trivial detail, thereby turning it into a tool of magic. Of course, each person is free to decide for oneself how fa r one wants to go­after all, ifs obvious that Crowley, as a fin-de-siecle man, had a preference fo r baroque pomp and excess symbolism, but this is merely a subjective opinion that shouldn't stop you from taking the same path, or a similar one. After all, the only dogma of pragmatic magic is '(The main thing is that it works!\" On a more functional level, ifs surely correct that the oil Crowley recommends (which, by the way, is identical to the oil of the Magic of Abramelin) should cause a burning sensation on the skin that can bring about various effects depending on the body part thafs anointed. For example, rubbing some of this oil onto your anja chakra can help improve your concentration, while the muladhara and svadisthana chakras should be anointed for sex magic operations. To day ifs quite common to use the plane­tary oils that are available in magic specialty shops; when used in conjunction with the corresponding planetary incense, these can induce an extremely strong state of plane­tary gnosis. Apart from that, the act of anointment has an ancient cult tradition as well, Introduction to Ritual Magic (XII) 419"},{"pageNumber":429,"pageContent":"and the Old Testament, for example, mentions it quite frequently. The n1odern magi­cian, however, mainly views it as a means of trance induction. The phials• to hold the oil have no fixed fo rm. However, according to Crowley, they should be made of pure rock crystal, and he also mentions that some magicians shape them in the fo rm of the fe male breast because this <<is the true nourishment of aU that lives)) (Magick, p. 61 ). For exactly this reason, he continues, they can also be made of mother-of-pearl and stoppered with a ruby. But the modern magician has other worries. The anointment phials are viewed in a more rational, purely functional manner and not turned into a magical weapon; if a ma­gician has five oils, one'll most likely have five different phials in various shapes and sizes. However, this doesn't mean that you cannot make a similar phial that's loaded with the appropriate symbolism fo r an all-purpose oil. In any case, it would certainly be a good idea fo r the magician to obtain a wide vari­ety of oils and experiment with them. We've already discussed the effect of scents and fragrances in this book, so no further explanation should be necessary. Even the effect of burning oils (or vaporizing them on a hot metal plate) shouldn,t be underestimated and can be quite helpful in programming the subconscious (psychological model) to react to certain correspondences. lucifer who says: i serve! and means the wrong god? who says: let me pull! and kisses the scaffold?
