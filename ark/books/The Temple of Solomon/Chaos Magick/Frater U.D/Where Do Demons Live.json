Plenty of others out there are fascinated by magic but donot have the opportunity to receive any kind of formal training. Just remember: mostmagicians are self-taught! Don't be afraid to try! In other words, to become skilled atmagic, you will just have to get off your butt and practice, practice, practice. No mastercan relieve you of the basic practical work that you will have to do, and no teacher canprotect you from having to just dive headfirst into the cold water so that you can learnthrough \"trial and error.\"It is not a master that you need. What you really need is the courage to finally tacklethe situation yourself. Martin Luther once said, `A despairing arse will never produce ahappy fart.\" So don't be afraid to take risks and just try. Go out into the woods and do apentagram ritual, invoke the spirits of the earth, or charge a sigil for magical power.Soon enough you will begin to realize that magic is headed your way with wide-openarms. But you will have to grasp the opportunity yourself!If you are unsure about certain technical details in your magical practice, seek outothers who might have more experience or attend a few workshops and seminars. Andthere are two things you should always remember: (1) When the student is ready, amaster will appear on his own. At least that is what masters of the Orient always say.(2) A \"master\" is never much more than a catalyst anyway, one that triggers processeswith only one ultimate goal-namely, to lead you to your actual, true master.

FROM K.Dear Karin,Yes and no. Let me start with the no: most magical orders consist of only a handful ofmembers with highly diversified qualifications. Thus, there is little time for the actualtraining of novices. After all, good teachers are scarce everywhere. The documents andsecret archives of such orders are frequently nothing more than what you can find in anygood book on magic (which are quite rare, too, by the way), and sometimes the authorsof such books are members of these orders, too. All too often, a magical order is merelya group of drinking buddies with esoteric interests. So the disappointment can be greatonce a beginner starts to see beyond all that secretive fuss, and the true rabbit-breedermentality starts to shine through that silken robe.But there is another side to the coin that certainly speaks in favor of membership ina magical ordernamely, its force field. Most beginners have trouble comprehending thatthe true task of an order is not to convey information, but rather to gradually bring itsmembers into contact with a specific force field. (In this sense, grades and degrees arenot really meant to be viewed as rewards for the successful completion of a certaincourse of study, but rather as milestones to define the tasks and goals that are yet to becompleted or reached. Therefore one often refers to \"fulfilling\" a grade.) There is littleto say about the force field of an order. You can only trust your instincts and intuition.As a rule of thumb: if you do not feel comfortable with its force field right from thestart, then you should by all means consciously avoid all contact with that order. Maybeits energy is generally not compatible with yours, or maybe it is just not the right timeto make contact."},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"All the best,Aunt Klara"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"DOES MAGIC ALWAYS HAVE TO BE SO RITUALISTIC? I SIMPLY CANNOTSTAND ALL THE DRAMATIC FUSS; I FIND IT QUITE RIDICULOUS AND ITREALLY GETS ON MY NERVES. IT IS ACTUALLY QUITE REVOLTING.PETER Z. FROM W.Dear Peter,Ritual magic is just one of the many branches of the magical arts. For example, when amagician charges a sigil or travels into a tattwa realm, it really does not have much todo with ritual in the technical sense of the word. The same applies to other magicalworkings, such as astral travel or healing with a magic mirror. However, with yourexpression dramatic fuss, I feel inclined to raise a finger here in warning.Just what is a ritual anyway? It is the dramaturgical interpretation of a magical actof will and the choreography of magical energy movements, as Frater U... D... alwayspreaches. We should remember that the subconscious mind is considered to be the mainsource of magical power (magis), and that it likes to think in imagery and sensorystimuli and does not care one bit about a cultivated sense of aesthetic appeal. It is like asmall child demanding clear, bold colors, pompous sentimentality, emotionalism, andeye-rolling exaggeration. The good ole ritual magician is aware of this and will play therole of Caesar when Caesar is called forclear, bold colors, sappy sentimentality, and soon and so forth. Then the subconscious mind will promptly join in the fun and doeverything in its power to bring about the object of desire. (By the way, this is exactlythe reason why rituals of thanks are important. They act as a reward for thesubconscious-like psychological PR work, in a sense.)One cynic once said that no one has ever lost any money by underestimating the"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"taste of American audiences. And that does not just apply to American audiences, butalso and especially to the subconscious mind. So be careful with such judgments andhave a little more respect for the child inside of you. After all, it showers you with anabundance of gifts day after day. No one will ever force you to perform rituals, butplease take a minute to think about the principles that they incorporate. Also keep inmind that rituals fulfill the need of religio that many people have, as well as the need toperform holy acts-and both of these needs are rooted very deeply. As far as the restgoes, remember that not all rituals are the same; you can certainly write more\"aesthetic\" scripts if that is what you prefer. As long as these are not over-intellectualized, the universe that we call the subconscious mind will like just aboutanything.That is all the preaching for nowAunt Klara"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"WHERE CAN I READ UP ON THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN EASTERN WAYS,SUCH AS THOSE FOLLOWED IN INDIA, AND THE VARIOUS MAGICAL PATHS?WHAT IS THE GENERAL DIFFERENCE BETWEEN EASTERN AND WESTERNTECHNIQUES? I AM A BIT WORRIED ABOUT \"MISIDENTIFICATION\" HERE.HOW CAN I GAIN SOME FAST AND EFFECTIVE INSIGHT INTO THE SUBJECT?CAN THE MAGICAL PATH EVER BE THE WRONG ONE? MAYBE IT IS EVENBETTER THAN THE WAY OF ZEN?MANFRED K. FROM F.Dear Manfred,Boy oh boy, that is quite an avalanche of questions. Well, then, here we go! On to yourfirst question: I have no idea where you came up with the notion that Eastern andmagical are so different, and I can assure you that there is not a whole lot of literatureout there that would discuss something like that. Maybe you have been fooled by thecommon misconception that only Eastern paths can be mystical, while Western ones are\"magical.\" Now that is certainly not true, as can clearly be seen in the numerousmagical systems within Taoism, such as the ancient Tibetan religion Bon and HinduTantrism, just to name a few. All of these are strongly influenced by shamanic elementsand therefore can quite accurately be described as \"magical.\"The common misconception that I mentioned above is based on something quiteordinary-namely, on the way these Eastern mystical systems are presented to us: afterall, their language, customs, and culture are very foreign to us Westerners. Thus, wehave to rely on others to convey these foreign concepts to us, and as far as that isconcerned, the old rule of thumb applies: \"First come, first served.\" For example, somepeople are utterly flustered when they encounter magicians who only work with fivechakras instead of seven. The only reason for this is the mere fact that much more"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"literature about the seven-chakra system has been translated into Western languagesthan about the numerous other Eastern chakra systems. (There are even systems thatwork with 64 or 144 chakras, for example.)Due to the lack of information, people often mistakenly believe that there can onlybe one \"true\" system. And due to such a lack of information, a person of Westernsociety automatically thinks that such Eastern ways are always mystical. But we shouldkeep in mind that there is no such thing as the one and only Eastern path, just as nosingle Western path exists either.The techniques of both systems are principally the same, with only a few majordifferences once you look past all the culturally specific frills. The names of the deities(or demons) invoked or evoked are different, as are the basic ritual structures andsecondary disciplines at times. Chinese magicians, for example, do not use muchastrology in their work (if Chinese astrology can be compared at all to our Westernconcept of the term; instead, it is more like a type of daily and yearly divination similarto that of the ancient Egyptians), and they also do not use any symbols from the HebrewKabbalah. Instead, the symbolism of the I Ching plays a large role.But despite all of the superficial differences, the fundamental principles of magicare almost always the same. Formulas such as \"will + imagination + trance = magic\" arevalid worldwide-from the illiterate shamans of Siberia or the Upper Amazon basin tothe literary magic of the European Faust books or the Muslim magic of the Koran.It is interesting that you mention the word misidentification, though. You areprobably referring to the fundamental statement that many Eastern systems make:namely, that our world is Maya, which is often incorrectly translated as \"illusion.\"Incorrect in the sense that this so-called \"illusion\" is very real and therefore significant.The old master Aleister Crowley put this quite nicely once: \"The whole universe is anillusion, but it is an illusion difficult to get rid of.\"\"Misidentification\" could therefore occur by denying the illusionary nature ofcreation and convincing oneself of being something that is steady and constant, or non-illusionary. (A Taoist would say-con vincing oneself that anything stable at all can existapart from change.)"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"But sometimes magic is also called the \"art of illusion.\" Just take a look at the tarotcard The Magician, which was commonly called \"The juggler\" in earlier times. Themagician is considered to be a master of illusion who plays with these illusions like ajuggler at a fair; this, however, does not imply that the results of magic are nothing butlies and deception (although skeptics might hope that were true!). The results are onlyrelative, just like everything else. \"Fast and effective\" insight can be gained primarilythrough everyday practical magic. After all, its sole objective is to achieve results.Either you are able to perform magic, or you are not. If you approach it empirically likethis, then you will not be able to fool yourself.On the other hand, dear Manfred K., I have the impression that you are moreconcerned about receiving a so-called \"absolute\" answer. You are probably a mysticallyoriented person-otherwise you would not have asked that last question at all. So I willcertainly answer that question for you. Yes, of course, the magical path may indeed beunsuitable for some people. That is actually more often the rule than the exception.Without praising ourselves too much here, we can safely say that magicians havealways been part of a tiny, elite circle-despite the fact that many clergy members like toclaim that the opposite is true. If you ever point out to a Catholic priest thedemonstrably shamanic elements of the Holy Communion, the sacraments, or otherholy acts (necromancy, the spirits in \"fetishes,\" and even a sort of god-cannibalism, ortheophagy), he will certainly be quite annoyed. In fact, he would probably be thoroughlyappalled if you would go so far as to describe magic as the \"mother\" instead of the\"problem child\" of (his!) religion.Magic is all about \"doing,\" about taking action and being active. The magician takescontrol of his or her own destiny. Which is why a magician can even be an atheist,although this is usually the exception. The magician strives to conquer the Kingdom ofHeaven with his or her own two hands. The mystic, on the contrary, is of a morecontemplative nature and puts his or her faith in the grace of God. (One could also saythat the mystic is less of a rebel than the magician, and prefers obedience. After all,there is a good reason why the \"patron saint\" of Western magic is Lucifer, the bringer oflight, who defiantly shouts his \"non serviam!\" at his Demiurge-mystics would view thisas an unheard-of act of insubordination.)To wrap things up, just keep this in mind: Zen and magic do not exclude one another"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"at all-on the contrary. For example, if you work with the \"active Way of Zen\" aspracticed in Asian martial arts, then your head will be full of stories about the magicalskills of martial-arts masters. It is pretty much the same with zazen. Basically, there isjust one single maxim: \"Do what thou wilt-but do it right!\" And every magician shouldbe able to agree with that, don't you think?Of course, if you would rather meditate than perform magic, then by all means doso. As I already said, not everyone is born to be a magician, and it would be silly toattempt to judge people's dispositions. No single path is better than another (or more\"holy\" or more \"true\" or any other silly adjective that those theologians-esoteric ones,too!-can come up with).Now, please do not ask me which path you should take. That is really entirely up toyou.

IS THERE ANY TRUTH TO THIS?SIGRID T. FROM A.Dear Sigrid,There may be a little or a lot of truth to this, depending on how you look at it.Let us be honest. From an ordinary historical point of view, most of these claims arecomplete rubbish! It is difficult for many orders to resist the temptation of decoratingthemselves with ancient foreign feathers according to the belief that \"old equals good.\"For example, there is a certain Rosicrucian organization that boldly claims that Socratesand Echnaton were once members. Theodor Reuss, who was-among so many otherthings-a notorious dealer of fake credentials, once convinced Rudolf Steiner to purchasea certain order's charter for 1,500 reichsmarks (which was a lot of money back then!).That purchase helped Steiner become Rex Summus X° of the O.T.O. long before \"GoodOle 666\" Aleister Crowley ever even joined the order!And even the Golden Dawn had the audacity to falsify documents (and quiteclumsily at that) in order to supposedly \"prove\" its legitimacy. This obsession withlegitimacy, however, seems quite silly to members of the younger generation, who areoften quite critical of their own backgrounds and family dogmas and no longer hold theopinion that everything that is old and passed down must automatically be good.Moreover, to use the example of the Golden Dawn again, an order with an otherwiseexcellent concept may crumble to pieces because of unnecessary stumbling blocks-likethe exposure of such a swindle."},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"In places where there are gaps in an order's history, crazy stories of a \"spiritualaffinity\" or even \"reincarnation\" are sometimes concocted to give the whole thing moreauthority. Along the way, dubious sources are often cited to support these stories, suchas the \"secret archives of the Vatican.\" Since the papal state never really deniesanything as a rule, this is a surefire method, especially considering the fact that therealways have been and always will be people who will fall for something like this. (Somuch for the negative side of the coin ... )As with everything else in life, there is also a bright side. And in order tocomprehend it, we need to understand that truthfulness in the everyday sense of theword is not always a virtue in magic. After all, magic is also the application ofmythology and symbolism, and mythological or symbolical truths cannot always beequaled with the objective facts of science. But that does not necessarily make themuntrue! (An anecdote functions in a similar manner. It, too, does not necessarily have todescribe a \"true event.\" It is sufficient enough if it could be true or plausible, and if itaccurately describes the person's character according to the common consensus.) Andwhy should we as magicians, with an interest in transcending time and space, hesitate totell stories? Especially considering the fact that since such stories are always subjective,they are told and listened to in a highly critical way, and consequently reinvented andadapted from generation to generation.Just remember two things: (a) do not confuse the various levels with one another,and (b) do not lose sight of the practical value. Not confusing the levels means: do notconsciously use deception or trickery and do not turn myths into objective facts, sincethis would automatically depreciate their practical value. This, in turn, would fulfill theexpectations that such a world view has to offer.It is a well-known fact that many shamans rave about the \"good ole days\" whenmagicians were much more powerful than they are today. This is a typically human wayof explaining away the past, and also a means of blocking the censor. By firmlybelieving that people could levitate in the past, it makes being able to levitate nowmuch easier, since we principally believe that it can be done. Indeed, some people tendto avoid the strenuous task of even thinking at all, by holding beliefs such as \"I stand inthe true current of wisdom,\" or simpler yet, \"It has always been like that.\" But of coursethis can work like a double-edged knife.

And in no way do I mean any of the above in a derogatory sense.Karl Marx is claimed to have once said that truth is whatever is useful to a person. Andthat applies in particular to magic. So whoever needs a glorious past in order to workbetter magically should feel free to create one. Experience shows, however, that placingsuch importance on history is more of a pitfall than an asset, since it causes a tendencyto appreciate the outer form more than the inner essence.To wrap things up, let me summarize as follows: if time is an illusion, then weshould also use it as raw material for our telesmatic actions, such as our outlook on life,beliefs, matter, spirit, magical power, and so on. But we should only do it out of a senseof inner freedom and with the awareness that we as magicians are capable of doingabsolutely anything that we really want to-and that includes the invention of biologicalor spiritual ancestors.And now, my practical advice: If you come across an order whose rituals andknowledge supposedly stem back to the days of Osiris without any gaps, then pleasetake a very close look and see how serious that claim is. And if an order tries to makeyour mouth water with the claim to have evidence in the form of \"secret documents\"that are, unfortunately, only available to the higher grades and degrees, then you cansafely make a black mark next to this organization's name in the honesty category-although that does not automatically mean you might not be able to learn somethingthere. Just don't expect to be welcomed with open arms if you let them know that you'vecaught on to their little game.And now I have an appointment with my old Incan aunt from back in the days ofAtlantis to plot the future fate of the world ...All the best from your dreadfully knowledgeable"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"Aunt Klara"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"DEAR AUNT KLARA! TELL ME, WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT FRANZBARDON'S SYSTEM (KABBALAH, ETC.)? I HOPE MY QUESTION WILL NOTCAUSE YOU ANY SLEEPLESS NIGHTS WHILE CHEWING ON YOURFINGERNAILS.GUNTHER F. FROM W.Dear Gunther,Thank you very much for being so concerned about my manicure. (Why didn't you askif my toenails might curl at your question?) But don't worry, I have experienced worsethan that in my fifty-plus magical years. Seriously now: of course there is no objectiveway of saying what I think about Franz Bardon and his magic, so what you are probablylooking for is my personal opinion. Well, that opinion would be quite mixed. Frater U...D... liked to criticize Bardon for his dogmatic approach, and as a result angryBardonians retorted by calling him a \"naive scribbler\" and a \"charlatan,\" but that is thefate of all those who have ever dared to trample on someone else's honor. It also showshow important Bardon still is today, which certainly cannot be the result of a meremisunderstanding.But what makes Bardon so great and so controversial at the same time? In order tounderstand this, we have to dig way back into the past and try to view this magicianwithin the context of his era. Without a doubt he has given us a magical system that isboth comprehensive and cohesive. In addition, he has taken great pains to write in astyle that is clearly understandable-a fact that is greatly appreciated by many.Back when Bardon's books were first published (I can still remember ... it was in theearly 1950s, and we were simply starving for good literature on magic), they presenteda true bright light on the horizon. They saved us the trouble of having to gathereverything from various obscure sources, and Bardon presented us with the legend of a"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"\"high initiate\" who is finally able to explain everything. The fact that this \"everything\"did not go all that deep was easily overlooked in the vast quantity of material that hepresented, and hardly anyone noticed that many \"explanations\" were actually more like\"transfigurations.\" After all, you always knew what to expect with Bardon: like no otherserious author of books about magic (and he can still be considered that today), he madea clear distinction between good and evil, right and wrong.However, we tend to get smarter with time, so when bold questions are asked and weget nothing but smart answers in return, or the questions are avoided altogether, we alsotend to get more skeptical and critical. Not that his system would not work-it doesindeed for many people, and often too well, at that! But in the end, that is true of allmagical systems that are self-contained and cohesive. To make a long story short:Bardon is especially well suited for beginners wanting an excellent introduction tomagic. Unfortunately, though, he also makes sure that the beginner remains a beginnerfor a very long time (if not forever) as a result of fanatical thoroughness. He does thisby means of constant warnings and admonitions, and by providing exercise guidelinesthat are in principle correct, but on the whole entirely unrealistic and unnecessary. Hisfirst step alone can easily take ten to thirty years, and that is still a far cry from actualmagic. Some of his exercises are excellent, as long as you ignore his instructions aboutpractice time.But personally, I do not like Bardon's silly, patriarchal manner. There is no doubtthat he accomplished great things in his time, but considering the vibrant intelligence ofa certain Aleister Crowley or the grim intensity and uncompromising originality of acertain Austin Osman Spare, Bardon is merely a small light in comparison. He nevermade any \"spiritual quantum leaps,\" and could never hold a light even to his teacherRah Omir Quintscher. He was an archivist and a compiler, a bookworm by nature whowanted to make his own visions binding for others-which he succeeded in doing for afairly long time, at least in German-speaking areas.To contemporary novice magicians, however, Bardon's dogmatism often proves tobe disastrous. One could even say that his books (in contrast to those of the othermagicians previously mentioned) already seem to be quite outdated. He sets rules wherenone are necessary, points out restrictions where none actually exist, and intimidateswhere words of encouragement and consolation would be much more effective. When"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"reading his words, one has the impression that he is really not interested in having hisstudents make any progress. Instead, he seems more concerned with basking in his ownglory, which of course seems quite fake and conveys a false impression. Surely everygood magician has a tendency toward self-adulation; after all, this is a naturalcharacteristic of a strong (but not necessarily \"mature\") personality. But Bardon as aperson remains inaccessible to the reader. Instead, any personalized aspect is stifled bymoral preaching and bigotry, and Bardon never mentions a word about his own practiceapart from vague insinuations.I could go on forever in this manner, but let us forget about all of that and just saythat Bardon is a wellknown brother-in-kind whom we should finally see off into a well-deserved retirement.

FROM F.Dear Manfred,Thank you, my dear, I am doing as well as can be expected-as the lie goes. (What otheroptions are there, really?) Since you are already an old acquaintance, so to speak, I havegrown used to having to reword your questions a bit more clearly on my own. How elsecould I understand what you mean when you vaguely ask, 'What about the karmicrepercussions\"?It is quite simple: karma is the law of cause and effect. Do you agree? When I attack"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"someone with my magic and give it my all, then I have created the cause and willtherefore reap the effect. So, what form does this effect take? Ha ha ha, well, that isexactly where the problem begins! In nearly all metaphysical considerations, one verysimple fact is overlooked: the effect that I reap (the \"karma\") is nothing but the fact thatsomeone else gets everything that I have dished out, provided that my work wassuccessful. And that is that. End of the definition.Just as Frater U.S. D.-. says in his studies on combat magic, I also feel that it is adisastrous mistake to believe that there is some kind of cosmic authority that will slapus on the hand in punishment. It might be nice if it really did work like that, but apartfrom the visions of those \"afterlife New Agers\" there is no evidence of anything likethis whatsoever. In other words, although the law of cause and effect certainly doesexist (at least in the pre-Heisenbergian universe), there is no such thing as moralcategorization, as any Buddhist teacher will confirm.In any case, this belief can be disastrous for the main reason that it distracts us fromthe fact that we are responsible for protecting ourselves when we are attacked. Althoughworking with a higher authority (guardian angel, clan totem, and so on) can indeedmake a person invulnerable to a certain extent, this requires a great deal of preliminarypractical ground work. Mere wishful thinking is simply not enough! During a magicalattack, there is nothing worse than having a false sense of security. After all, magicalenergies are often very subtle and like to \"sneak in through the back door,\" so it isabsolutely necessary to deal with them technically and without bias. The so-called\"karma\" that so-called \"black magic\" causes is actually an entirely different story.On the one hand, it could be caused by the bad conscience that often accompaniessuch an operation. This can become a bad spearhead that may turn against the attackingmagician. The results (often subconscious in nature) can take the form of self-punishment mechanisms that can bring about a sort of Pyrrhic victory in which bothparties, the perpetrator and the victim, end up grumpily moping about.But there are also magical protection tools that can cause the invasive energy tobounce back to the perpetrator like a good deflection shield. If the assailant does notexpect something like this to happen, a magical backfire can occur, meaning that one'sown magic can boomerang right back. But of course that is merely a technical problem"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"that can certainly be avoided by taking appropriate precautionary mea sures. After all,magical combat can escalate quickly, resulting at least temporarily in extreme paranoiafor both parties. For this reason, all experienced combat magicians will agree thatmagical warfare should always be the very last option (just like in the military). This isall the more true when you realize that a magical war waged by individuals demands theaccomplishment of tasks that not even an entire army could fulfill. Not until you haveconsidered all of these aspects should you be worried about karma as a \"bank account inthe afterlife\" and about the consequences for a possible later incarnation (if you believein such a thing)-and really not until then! Help yourself, then God will help you.Now, on to your second question: honestly, I do not care one bit about whether apoltergeist knocks five times or rattles three times. What I notice in the wording of yourquestion, though, is something entirely different, namely the misconception that beingable to cause paranormal phenomena is supposedly proof of occult skills. You haveobviously gotten that from Colin Wilson. But there is also evidence that good ole HPB(Helena P. Blavatsky) sometimes applied a few tricks of her own when things did not goas planned. And when her tricks were exposed, it caused her to lose the head position inthe Theosophical Society, which she had founded.Plus, never confuse magic with psi. Although psi phenomena are a part of everydaymagical life, the magician should give them as little attention as a yogi gives to hissiddhis. What use is it if you can bend a spoon with the power of your mind, but you cannever get a parking space with magic during rush hour? Or if you can never see beyondthe tip of your nose and are not able to grow and develop?But I am not trying to avoid your question here, so I would like to say a few wordsabout the rattling noises. Are we dealing with astral beings, or complexes that haveautonomously splintered off? Well, how should I know that? But seriously: both casesare nothing but labels that do not really provide any explanations. What on earthactually is a \"complex that has autonomously splintered off\"? Who splinters off what,how, and why? Even Thomas Mann let himself be satisfied with such lame pseudo-explanations as \"magically objectivized wishful thinking on the partof the medium,\" although he personally attended Schrenck-Notzing's seances! Let's justaccept the fact that we simply do not know exactly what magic we are dealing with"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"here. The hypothesis about astral spirits is no better or worse than those pseudo-scientific monster words used by Jung. In any case, none of the theories can be proved.That leads us to the question of how to deal with such phenomena. Here it can onceagain be considered a blessing that the occult doctrines in dealing with the\"unexplained\" have brought about new technology that is meanwhile millennia old. Thepossibilities are numerous, and although I cannot go into detail about everything here,your reference to exorcism is certainly appropriate. Although I dare to doubt whether apope is the right man to do the job, unless a very Christian household is involved. PeteCarroll once wrote that usually only the residents themselves have to be exorcized andnot their homes, and that is quite true. Often poltergeists occur around teenagers inpuberty, and also where mentally disabled or mentally retarded people live. My ownobservations have shown that people with strong sexual frustrations often trigger suchphenomena as well.A skilled magician, a shaman, or a trained witch can all eliminate such occurrenceswith ease by harmonizing or treating the person who is triggering the occurrences. Invery rare cases, a spirit trap must be constructed and set off, but this should really beleft to highly experienced magicians who ideally should be skilled in psychology andhuman relations as well.Haunted greetings,Your Aunt Klara"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"DEAR AUNT KLARA, WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT A MAGICAL OPERATIONTHAT WAS A SUCCESS, BUT THEN LATER INFORMATION REVEALED THATT H E DESIRED RESULT HAD ALREADY OCCURRED LONG BEFORE THEMAGICAL ACT WAS PERFORMED?DIEGO S. FROM H.Dear Diego,Your question touches right on a sore spot that, on the other hand, is also a trulyfascinating aspect of magic. A sore spot insofar as that the \"true reasons\" for suchphenomena are beyond our comprehension. Since you unfortunately failed to mention apractical example, I will do it for you. Aleister Crowley once wanted to receive a letterfrom a friend who I believe lived in Australia. It was a very important letter. WhenCrowley was tired of waiting, he performed an appropriate ritual. A few days later, hereceived the desired letter. Curiously, though, the letter had been written and sent a fewdays before the ritual was performed (intercontinental mail service was quite slow atthe time).There are several possible models of explanation for such occurrences. The simplestand therefore probably the most appealing explanation would be that it was principallya divination: the magician intuitively senses that a certain event is imminent and actsinstinctively in order to \"bring it about.\" The question is, however, whether or not thedesired result would have occurred without prior triggering by the ritual. (For example,the letter could have been lost.) Of course, there is no way to ever be sure, but in any"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"case there are some magi cians who will advise you to always perform the ritualanyway, even if the desired result has already occurred before the ritual actually takesplace. That at least has the advantage that the matter can be ultimately concluded byusing the symbolic language of the subconscious mind. A religious person wouldpossibly perform a ritual of thanks.Modern magic is increasingly interested in getting to the bottom of this phenomenonof \"retroactive magic,\" as it is technically called. After all, we modern magicians live ina world that is filled with science fiction and stories about travels through time in whicheven physicists calculate time \"backwards.\" If magic really is only the directing ofinformation (and many things support this), and if information exists beyond theboundaries of space and time and can be transferred (after all, it does not contain matterand possibly not even energy), then we can see various models of explanation flashingon the horizon that could knock an old aunt like me, permanent wave and all, right offher feet.Then the question is: Can we change the past with magic? Can we (afterwards, mindyou!) shift the switches of time? Honestly, I am quite hesitant to propose such aprofound, reality-shattering claim. But if, and I repeat if, this were actually true, thenretroactive magic would actually be \"memories of the future\"-a concept that wouldmake the space gods and UFOs of Charroux and Daniken seem like harmless gardengnomes in comparison.If the magician-as often claimed and repeatedly confirmed by magic's practitioners-actually can change reality, if this reality exists beyond time and space, and if we cansucceed in giving this claim a theoretical and practical, applicable, examinablefoundation, then it probably would not be exaggerating to say that we are currentlyabout to make the largest spiritual quantum leap in the entire history of humanity in thefield of magic (and not only there).My dear Diego, I am very sorry that I was only able to answer your question withnumerous other questions. But don't take it too hard. Our time is certainly not up yet,and if the current development within the magic scene lives up to just half of what itpromises, soon the kind of magic we call our own will surely be magic as humanity hasnever before known it."},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"Here's to the pioneering spirit!Hurrah!Aunt Klara"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"DEAR AUNT KLARA, ONE QUESTION HAS BEEN BOTHERING ME FOR YEARS-TO BE MORE SPE- CIFICf EVER SINCE I BEGAN EXPERIMENTING WITHEVOCATIONS. WHERE DO DEMONS LIVE?PETRA H. FROM Z.Dear Petra,Oh boy, did you catch me off guard with that one! Hmm, where do they live? Afterseveral sleepless nights, I finally realized that this question is not as strange, trite, oreven funny as it first seems. You are probably hinting at the endless debate betweenanimists and spiritists that still gets people (e.g., parapsychologists) quite worked up.The animists believe that demons (and all other \"seemingly transcendental beings\") areactually psychological projections, meaning that they originate within the magicianhimself or herself.On the other hand, the spiritists claim that demons are real, self-sufficient entitiesthat would exist even without our help. According to the animists, then, these flaky ladsreside in your own soul, whereas the spiritists insist that they live in the astral world (orin a similar place; the different levels of the various systems are so numerous that it'shard to keep track of them all). Neither group can scientifically prove its position, norcan either group disprove the position of the other. So, again, it is merely a question ofhow one views his or her own universe from an objective standpoint. Since a truemodern magician is continually training his or her ability to smoothly shift from oneparadigm to another, it doesn't matter much how things \"really\" are, especiallyconsidering the fact that the word real does not hold much value. If you would like apragmatic approach, however, I can recommend the following:Only view demons as real, existing beings when you are performing evocations (forexample, when summoning demons to appear in a triangle you have created); at all"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"other times, consider them to be merely an aspect of yourself. This method has threeadvantages: (a) when not performing ritual work, you are not susceptible to the pranksthat these little devils like to play; (b) it ensures that demons will manifest more easilyduring your ritual work with the circle and triangle; (c) you will be training yourself tothink flexibly, thus enabling a fast shift from one paradigm to another.However, if you feel that you can ignore my advice, then I can only say thefollowing: if you really do conjure a demon and it manifests, it always feels like a real,autonomous being, regardless of what your common sense might have to say about it.Admittedly, an experience like that will probably make you tremble in your robe, andthe energy produced by fear is exactly what makes such manifestation possible in thefirst place. But if a demon appears and you think, \"Ha! You are nothing but a projectionof the dark side of my soul\" and you feel incredibly clever in doing so, just like C. G.Jung himself, then that is nothing but foolishness-and you are obviously much moreinterested in supporting your intellectual concept than having a true demonicexperience. Maybe you are just scared? After all, demons are not the kind of guys that asensible aunt would want to have at her tea party. Explaining your way out of thingsmay work to banish them, but it will not eliminate their existence entirely.With a demonic grin,Aunt Klara"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"I HAVE NOTICED THAT THERE ARE A GREAT NUMBER OF WORKSHOPSBEING OFFERED ON THE SUBJECT OF MAGIC. ARE SUCH EVENTSBENEFICIAL OR IS IT BETTER TO PRACTICE ON ONES OWN, FOR EXAMPLEWITH THE HELP OF BOOKS? OF COURSE IT IS ALSO A QUESTION OF MONEY.SUCH WORKSHOPS ARE CERTAINLY NOT CHEAP.KARL-HEINZ R. FROM H.Dear Karl-Heinz,Well, it all depends on how disciplined and creative you are. Of course, it is always agood idea to make your own experiences. On the other hand, there is no point in wantingto reinvent the wheel time and again. Apart from all that, many books on magic are ofdoubtful quality at best and often only convey bits and pieces of information instead ofcoming right out with the whole truth. Although that can happen in a workshop as well.But a good teacher can save you years of meandering about on your own and wastingyour money on expensive but useless books. A bad teacher, on the other hand, mayeither discourage or disappoint you, or literally send you running into the arms ofbooksellers and librarians. The stupid thing, though, is that you usually will not be ableto tell which kind of teacher you are dealing with until after you have already spent agood deal of money to take part in the workshop.So let me give you a few tips here that might help you to distinguish, ahead of time,a good workshop from a bad one:1. The price is not the issue! A high fee is no guarantee of satisfactory performance. Onthe other hand, unusually cheap seminars are often sales events in disguise, intendedto market expensive products (e.g., special tools that the workshop organizers sell oncommission), and there is also no guarantee that the lecturer will not be a fraud."},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"2. Always find out in advance the maximum number of people who will be allowed toparticipate in the workshop. Do not attend seminars with more than thirtyparticipants if there is only one teacher. In situations like these, the participantsusually do not get their fair share due to a lack of individual attention. Mass eventsof over fifty or even a hundred participants are only appropriate for lectures, but notfor practical workshops that depend on the monitoring of one's progress andguidance by a teacher.3. Carefully read all information available about the workshop. This should be obvious,but it is an aspect that is sometimes overlooked. Ask yourself if you reallyunderstand what the workshop is all about. Is the available information full ofincomprehensible foreign words? Is the information too vague? Language can reveallots of things! When in doubt, follow your intuition. Or consult your pendulum ortarot cards to find the answer as to whether or not you should attend the workshop.4. Pay close attention to the terms of cancellation; this is often the snag to suchseminars. Although it is understandable that the event organizers should want toensure a certain degree of commitment from the participants, it is nonethelesspossible that a person might become sick or have another valid reason forcancellation. Only pay the full amount in advance as an exception and not as the rule;generally, no more than half in advance is appropriate.Workshops present a number of advantages that should not be underestimated. Youwill meet likeminded people with various levels of knowledge. If you are open to theexperience, you can get a number of ideas and suggestions from the various fields ofesotericism, and about magic in particular. The continual exchange of ideas with otherworkshop participants makes even the dullest material enjoyable and lively. If you justhappen to get an open-minded teacher who not only masters the trade but also enjoyswhat he or she is doing and has a certain degree of intuitive understanding, you mightjust be able to save many frustrating years of dabbling about on your own. And it neverhurts to meet more like-minded practitioners.However, do not attend too many workshops and seminars.

HOW AND ACCORDING TOWHAT RULES (IF THERE ARE ANY OUT THERE BASED ON PRACTICALEXPERIENCE) CAN ctMUSICK\"l BE COMPOSED/STRUCTURED IN ORDER TOMAKE IT MAGICALLY USEFUL? DILIGE ET QUOD VIS FAC.FRANK S. FROM I.Dear Frank,You certainly cannot expect me to present you with thorough, step-by-step instructionson how to write music. Even if I were able to (actually, I have no such knowledgewhatsoever-at most I can play the radio), there would not be enough room here to allowfor that. Nonetheless, I'd like to try to point out a few basic elements that might at leastshed some light upon the subject of the magical use of music.According to studies of pop music, the type of compositions that are most successfulare those with rhythms that are closest to that of the human heartbeat. So that would atleast be a good way to start. Ritual drum music (at least during the first few minutes)also works closely with the rhythm of the heart. The reason why this is so important,especially at the start of a magical operation, is explained by a simple psychological(sympathetic-magical) trick: namely, the fact that the involuntary bodily functions tendto react to external stimuli and to adapt to them if these external stimuli imitate thebodily functions first. In other words: if you begin by drumming to the rhythm of theheart and then slowly speed up the rhythm, the heartbeats of the listeners willautomatically go faster, trying to catch up. (You can also influence a person by adaptingyour breathing rhythm to theirs, in a barely audible way, and then changing your own"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"rhythm step by step. In nine out of ten cases, the victim will automatically adapt to yourrhythm.) In this way, you can gradually bring the ritual participants into a trance, thustriggering the release of the body's own endorphins (also known as \"brain opium\"), asyou correctly noted.A monotonous rhythm is important here. Shamanic ritual music is namely quitemonotone and repetitious. In addition, the sequence of sounds and rhythms should bekept relatively simple, and should reflect a certain tonal, rhythmic harmony;complicated jumps are difficult for both the organism and the mind to follow.Now, there are still the factors of melody and volume. In magical music, melodiesshould also be kept simple-they should neither stir you up nor put you to sleep, althoughof course certain critical passages can be used to achieve certain effects. The melodiesshould correspond to the typical listening preferences of the individual magician, andthese obviously differ from culture to culture. For example, if you have never beforebeen confronted with Indian bhajans or Tibetan ritual music, you will probably havetrouble falling into any kind of trance and be more preoccupied with thoughts such as\"Turn off that awful howling sound!\"The volume of music is a debatable issue that strongly depends on individuallistening preferences. Those who have been torturing their eardrums to near deafnessfor years in clubs and at live concerts will probably want to turn it up full blast.Although I personally believe that a person should (re)learn to listen to more subtlesounds.According to my humble experience on the subject, pure cacophonies are only, atbest, suitable for divination. Since the human brain cannot stand \"meaningless\" stimulifor a sustained period of time, it will attempt to find patterns in the tonal chaos. If aperson is skilled in knowing how to use this, he or she can construct an oracle (a sort ofacoustic inkblot test) with the hopes of luring sound-associated answers to arise fromthe depths of one's own psyche.By the way, I think it is a bunch of nonsense when those die-hard \"New Agers\"sometimes claim that modern rock and pop music is detrimental to the organism, theaura, the chakras, the karma, or whatever else. (By the way, that reminds me of the"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"aphorism by Emil Cioran: \"Music is the refuge of souls ulcerated by happiness.\" Howabout looking at things this way for a change?!) It may be true that Led Zeppelin andThe Cure have no great fans among the plant world (as tests supposedly have proven),but can this be assumed about people, too? If you look at the history of rock 'n' roll, youwill see that this type of music had only one goal in mind-to create a state of ecstasy inthe listener. And in the end, that is the ultimate goal of any type of music.That is why a musick magician should try and expand his or her listening experienceas much as possible. Just listening to nothing but rock or punk is onesided and thereforepragmatically useless, especially if the sound of ba-rock or rock-oco makes you nervousand want to cover your ears (or the other way around, of course).Merry melodies!Aunt Klara"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"DEAR AUNT KLARA, HOW DOES A DEATH SPELL ACTUALLY WORK?VERENA P. FROM D.My dear Verena,That is something you do not ask about in public! What will the neighbors think of us?But seriously now: there is no such thing as an \"ultimate\" death spell, and if you arelooking for a patented recipe here, I am sorry to disappoint you. To experts it is nosecret that death spells are among the most difficult types of magical undertakings ofall. And there is a good reason for that. A death spell is directed at the primeval sourceof the target person's magical power-namely, that person's survival instinct. There is nobetter protection than that; after all, this survival instinct makes life as we know itpossible in the first place. We can safely do away with the old, pseudo-enlightenedclaim that death spells only work if the victim is informed about them. That may be afine, reassuring placebo theory for esoteric softies, but not for grim coffee-sipping auntslike us who meet on a daily basis to pleasurably poke voodoo dolls with our knittingneedles.There are plenty of successful cases in which the victim has absolutely no idea whatpowers have been released so suddenly and specifically. Of course, I do not want toentirely eliminate the possibility that it sometimes works this way. In fact, it really isoften a lot easier for the magician when the target person's beliefs just take care of therest after a dramatic death announcement is made. And since magicians are notoriouslylazy people, they are often satisfied with just that-although the professional skepticsamong us will conclude that this is exactly what it's all about.But now I would like to reveal something to you, my dear evil little Verena (because"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"you obviously have a personal interest in the subject, which the feigned neutral wordingof your question reveals): almost all magical attacks are targeted at the victim'simmune system. (No, no, no ... please do not bring AIDS into the picture here. Thatreally has nothing to do with it!) This is quite logical, because once the immune systemis weakened, even the smallest, most seemingly harmless bacterium can become apotential ally of the attacker. Magical operations that aim at weakening the victim'saura, spells to cause confusion and disintegration, and of course, the ever-so-popularcar-crash magic-all of these techniques are used by magical villains to knock offmembers of the black list: rich aunts (no, I am not, so don't even try), mothers-in-law,spouses, rivals, bosses, teachers, lawyers, judges, neighbors, and even unloved pets.But never fear. Only on rare occasions are death spells truly deadly The victim'sinner resistance (the Master Therion might say the person's True Will) is usually muchtoo strong. But there are worse things than death anyway: for example, life as a zombie.At this point, I need to warn you against the widespread opinion that all \"blackmagic\" will automatically bounce back to the initiator sooner or later. Unfortunately-orluckily?-there is no such automatic mechanism, no such cosmic motherly regenerationprocess. No, there are other ways to protect yourself from a death spell-but that was notwhat you asked, was it?So I would like to wrap this up now with sappy, sweet greetings.

WHAT EXACTLY ISINFORMATION MAGIC ANYWAY? I WILL BE AWAITING YOUR ANSWERSWITH A WIDE GRIN ON MY FACE.XXV-I V: 9 8 9Dear XXV-IV:989!Wow, that sure is a mouthful of questions. Let me take one at a time.Information magic-Frater U.. D.. calls this discipline \"cyber magic\" (from magicand cybernetics = control theory)-is one of the oldest and, at the same time, mostmodern forms of magic around. So to start with, here is a quick lesson in the history ofmagic:Probably the oldest model of magic is the one that works with spirits. Here, a cleardistinction is made between the world of humans and the spirit world. The magicianacts as an intermediary (or border crosser) between these two worlds, and is able tohappily romp around in the spirit realm just as he or she does among humans-andamong clients who make use of the magician's services. Such spirits are treated as realbeings that actually exist, each having its own name, customs, likes and dislikes,talents, and shortcomings. The magician who works with this model must research thelaws of this spirit world and travel to it unless its residents are summoned down toEarth, although that is not really the finest way to do things. One learns the names andsecret passwords of the spirits, meanders through their hierarchies, and attempts to gainas many allies and make as few enemies as possible. These spirits will then activelyserve the magician and bring about the desired effects on the physical plane."},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"So far, so good. But as we all know, with this model magic remains stuck in itsdevelopment, just like the rest of our \"highly civilized\" human race.Around the time of the French Revolution, parallel to the trends of enlightenmentand rationalism, the field of natural science showed an interest in researching energies.That did not happen overnight, of course, and this phase lasted for a very long time. Infact, it is still ongoing, and one could even go so far as to say that this energy model ofmagic is popular now in these modern times. If you would like a few names forreference, here is a short list: Franz Anton Mesmer, the rediscoverer of hypnotism andanimal magnetism who mesmerized people in salons throughout Europe, puttingcountless clients and victims into a deep sleep; English Rosicrucian and magicianEdward Bulwer-Lytton, who coined the term vril to describe magical or subtle energy;Eliphas Levi, who put into words the theory of \"astral light\"; Karl von Reichenbach,still highly appreciated today, whose od has become a standard term in the occult;Madame Blavatsky, who liked to steal ideas from others, such as the Indian concept ofprana; a handful of unnamed ethnologists who first introduced the Polynesian conceptof many to academic discussions; and finally Frater U.. D..., who sinned in this sense aswell by attempting to introduce the word magis to mean magical power, althoughapparently he has not been very successful at it.But what is the energy model all about? Here we can gladly do without all thosespirits, demons, souls from the dead, and similar creatures. Instead, the magicianbecomes a sort of artist who works with energy. The magician can perceive a whole lotmore than just physical energy-after all, anyone can do that. Instead, the magician trainshis or her subtle perception, learns to direct subtle energies, to send and withdraw them,and naturally to polarize them as well, or even to \"inoculate\" them with statements ofintent.Let us take healing as an example. To heal someone, a shamanic spirit magicianwould try to identify the spirit that haunts the person and expel the monster using all thetricks in the book, including threats and bribery. He or she might also use spirit helpersto heal the sick person. But the energy magician would go about it quite differently.First, the energy magician would examine the balance of subtle energy in the patientand determine if there is too much or too little energy in certain spots. Then the energybalance would be restored by withdrawing or adding energy as appropriate, without"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"having to worry about the various hierarchies of spirits.Of course, this does not exclude the possibility of mixed-model forms. The exampleof Polynesian mana clearly shows that a magical culture is certainly able to work withboth spirits and energies. These models, therefore, serve more as a means ofillustration, and not every word should be taken literally. Also, in no way does thismean that one model has completely edged out and replaced another in its entirety. Forexample, traditionalistic magicians (e.g., who follow the tradition of Bardon) still preferto work with spirits and demons even today. Nonetheless, this does not stop them frombuilding up energy-for example, in the making of ritual weapons, talismans, and thelike.Since the end of the 1960s, a new model of magic has developed-once againoriginating in Englandcalled the psychological model, whose predecessors can be foundin the works of Austin Osman Spare and even Aleister Crowley. With this model, thepower to cause magical phenomena is ascribed to the subconscious mind, and so it is alogical consequence that the psychological magician is mainly concerned with itsconditioning. This can be accomplished, for example, through the generous use ofmagical paraphernalia and external stimuli (incense, robes, colorful sigils, and thewhole hodgepodge of magical correspondences). On the other hand, minimalists such asAustin Osman Spare will prefer simple sigils that are quickly made; after all, they arenothing more than commands to the subconscious-or, to put it more technically,intentional repression and the specific creation of complexes.But before you get a heart attack from all the suspense I am building here, I think itwould be time to finally say a few words about information magic itself. On the surface,each of these models seems to be a simplification and reduction of an earlier model.This is extremely obvious when you take a look at cyber magic, since it does not usespirits at all. In cyber magic, energy is no longer a means, but rather it has become theactual goal of the magical operation; and the only purpose that the psyche andsubconscious mind have is merely to make decisions on determining magical targetsand to perform the infomagical operation.What is the fundamental idea behind this discipline? It is assumed that energy initself is \"dumb.\" It needs structure or certain \"laws\" or \"commands\" so that it \"knows\""},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"how to behave. In a healing operation, the cyber-magician would waste no time at allwith trying to bring spirits, energies, or psychological disturbances under direct control.Instead, he or she would give the organism of the patient a \"healing input.\" A sort of\"circuit diagram\" for health is created within the organism that the energies,psychological structures, and even spirits, if you like, must adapt to. To illustrate thisprocess, terms from the field of computer science are used, but it would go too far hereto explain these in detail, especially since I have no knowledge of your familiarity withcomputers, my dear XXV-IV:989.In any case, this model has considerable advantages. For one, this type of operationcan be performed much more quickly than other magical techniques. A ritual using thespirit model may take days, weeks, or even months. Energy operations that areperformed ritually will take a few hours, whereas a psychological discipline such assigil magic can be done in just a few minutes once a certain degree of proficiency isobtained. On average, the cyber-magical transfer of information takes just a fraction ofa second. Plus, no external tools are needed for cyber magic since everything takesplace within the participant's own neurocomputer.According to the current state of knowledge, the prerequisite for successful cyber-magical work is the ability to activate the two main memories of the human organism-the brain and spinal cord. In India, they would call this \"awakening the kundalini,\" butthat would take us back to the energy model again.The whole point is that information in the cybermagical model does not require amedium (or physical conduit), since information is understood to be non-local andwithout mass. But since cyber magic is in the developmental stage right now, there isstill much to be learned about this aspect. At present, hundreds of magicians around theworld are actively experimenting with information magic, and we are curious to seewhat results they come up with.But why did I say that this form of magic is probably the oldest? Apart from the factthat a prototype of cyber magic can also be recognized in homeopathy, we are dealinghere with a form of the \"emptyhand technique,\" and it is a known fact that suchtechniques can be found in all magical traditions, at least as an ultimate goal.

I HAVE THEIMPRESSION THAT MANY AUTHORS AND REPRESENTATIVES OF THISTRADITION LIKE TO USE THE PAST FOR PROJECTING THEIR OWN FEARS,IMPOSSIBLE DREAMS, AND PROMISING DESIRES.WALTER Z. FROM F.Dear Walter,You probably want me to contradict you, but I am afraid you are entirely correct withyour assumptions. All the garbage that is now associated with the oncehonest trade ofwitchcraft is utterly confusing, resulting in the fact that one can hardly tell thedifference anymore. This is added to the fact that witchcraft is often misused as avehicle for transporting foreign ideologies that actually have nothing to do with theCraft itself.Since the feminist movement has taken over the tradition of witchcraft, the image ofthe witch in Western civilization has changed dramatically. That is not necessarily badin principle: men have had time enough to prove what they can and cannot do, and evenif this does not make women as a whole more perfect as a result, the role of a witch is asuitable label of identification. After all, it is no secret that in the five hundred years ofwitch hysteria initiated and controlled by the church, 80 percent of those persecutedwere women and not men. However, the fact that it was not only men who staged thispersecution but also countless women (and they did so vehemently at that) is usually"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"kept quiet.But what does this story of misery and human brainlessness actually have to do withthe tradition of witchcraft as we know it? Maybe we should take a more systematicapproach. So watch out now, dear Walter Z.: Aunt Klara is going to spit out a jumble ofhistorical facts and figures here.First, we need to establish the fact that there is evidence of the practice of witchcraftthroughout the entire world during all eras. But this does not automatically mean thatwhat we are dealing with today (especially in Europe) fulfills the definition of agenuine, centuries-old tradition consisting of an organization of like-minded people thatis divided up into a hierarchy and led with a certain amount of authority. Although therespected British Egyptologist Margaret Murray made many such claims, the narrow-minded academic world cannot be made entirely to blame for the fact that herstatements contained no more truth than the weather forecasts on television. But to befair, many of the things Murray claimed can indeed be backed by some facts. On theother hand, however, there is way too little evidence to give her hypothesis aboutwitchcraft being the ancient European nature religion more than a mere shaky status.What we know today as Wicca developed after World War II when British occultist(and eccentric) Gerald Brosseau Gardner had the audacity to publicly profess hispractice of witchcraft and to recruit new members, all despite the British WitchcraftAct. It is no surprise to hear that Gardner was a fan of Margaret Murray and readilyadopted her statements as his own. But in spite of this, he did make a few of his owncontributions: while his novel High Magic's Aid contained mainly dark whisperings andvague insinuations (which, of course, greatly aroused public interest), he was able toreally let his pants down a few years later, after the Witchcraft Act was finallyabolished. Gardner pole-vaulted himself straight to the top, declaring himself to be anagent of witchcraft who was granted permission-from other, older members of thetradition-to initiate new members. But since these alleged older members remainedbehind the scenes, as invisible as the \"Secret Chiefs\" of the Golden Dawn and theMahatmas of Theosophy, Gardner himself became the head of the Wicca movement.Modern-day Wicca is a mere sixty years old-quite young if you think about theclaims to historical legitimacy that it makes. The assertion that Wicca supposedly had"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"various predecessors cannot change this fact. Admittedly, Charles Godfrey Leland'sAradia, or the Gospel of the Witches was published in the late 1800s; and a few yearsbefore that, in his book The Synagogue of Satan, Stanislaw Przybyszewski posited theexistence of a witchcraft tradition in medieval Europe. And more recent research hasshown that ancient paganism (which was and still is quite often wrongly confused withwitchcraft) was in no way stomped out entirely by Christian missionaries during theircrusade of compulsory conversion. Nonetheless, the sad fact remains for the esoterichistorian that what is understood today as Wicca, or the tradition called witchcraft, ismainly a romantic conglomeration of predominantly anti-Christian ideals andresentment.As far as the rest goes, I am probably not the right person to talk to, my dear. Notbecause I am principally against witches, but rather because I have dedicated my life tothe Black Arts and prefer to stay far away from any type of pure religion. Which isbasically what Wicca is today. One could describe it in an unfriendly way as a neo-primitive fertility religion that plays merely a subordinate role in magic, at least in itspractical application.To be sure, many covens do their share of conjuring and sorcery, but thefundamental idea remains a religious one. Key phrases such as Mother Nature, back tothe Great Mother, living in harmony with nature, and the like make this unmistakablyclear. That is why I prefer to not make any judgmental calls here. There are somemagicians and sorcerers who place great value on the pursuit of some kind oftranscendence, regardless of how this may be defined; yet others describe themselves aspure magic technicians who are only concerned with expanding their control over whatis known as \"fate.\" Who is to be the judge?Greetings tainted with panic-stricken laughter ...Yours, Aunt Klara"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"DEAR AUNT KLARA, COULD YOU PLEASE TELL ME IF THERE IS A FORM OFFREEMASONRY TODAY THAT IS MAGICALLY ACTIVE? I WOULD ALSOAPPRECIATE IT IF YOU COULD PROVIDE ME WITH A CONTACT ADDRESS.BARTHOLOMEW M. FROM D.My dear Bartholomew,First of all, I must kindly refuse your request to provide you with an address. There areseveral reasons for that, including the fact that there really is no current form ofFreemasonry that works with magic. Apart from that, it is not my job to provide anytype of contact information, which has nothing to do with me trying to be unfriendly,but rather with the fact that magic has always had a bad reputation in the press andthose active in this field need to exercise an extreme amount of discretion.But back to your original question. Many magical orders emerged from exactly thisdilemma: that although Freemasonry is a legitimate keeper and preserver of Westernmagical symbolism and mythology, it has developed into a mere social club withritualistic and mythical trimmings, to put it nicely. Even today, no one really knowswhat existed first-Rosicrucianism or Freemasonry. However, one thing is for sure:Rosicrucianism in the nineteenth century held an openly critical opinion of the lack ofmagical practice within Freemason lodges. This was not enough, though, forcontemporaries such as Eliphas Levi and S. L. \"MacGregor\" Mathers; thus, variousmagical lodges and orders were created that did indeed, like it or not, contain elementsof Freemasonry, but considered themselves above all to be practical executioners of the\"old knowledge\" that Freemasonry allegedly was preserving.But now Freemasonry is a huge movement, and it would surely be unfair to lump allof its various lodges together. As is so often the case, we need to differentiate here"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"between official doctrine and private practice. The official representatives ofFreemasonry will usually get quite pale in the face if you link them in any way toesotericism or-horribile dictu- magic. Once when I tried asking a Belgian Freemasonabout his relationship to mysticism, all of a sudden the guy had no idea what I wastalking about! It was utterly incomprehensible to him that I could see a connectionbetween Freemasonry and mysticism or the pursuit of transcendence. Well, the guybelonged to the obedience of the Grand Orient of Paris, which is known for having astrong atheistic attitude. But it is not much different with the `Ancient Scots.\" Thereyou at least have to believe in God, although that certainly does not make it magical.On the other hand, I know many Freemasons who have made the conscious choice tobe magicians as well, and I know for example that Freemasonry in Austria is beginningto sow its first esoteric or magical seeds, which is no wonder considering the growinginterest that younger members are showing in such things. However, I am not aware ofany (regular) lodge that does any kind of magical work in the least. So whoever isblinded by the nimbus of the ancient venerableness that Freemasonry undoubtedly has,in the attempt to find any kind of knowledge of practical magic there, the search will bein vain. Of course, there is always the chance that you might run into a certain FMbrother who is interested in such things, but you probably shouldn't tell the world aboutit, since the high-ranking leaders will most likely not approve.It is a bit different in so-called \"irregular\" Freemasonry, however. Above all, theRite of Memphis- Misraim should be mentioned here, of which even Aleister Crowleywas a member. But I cannot really say for sure whether or not there is really moreaction there than in other Masonic lodges.In any case, what we consider to be \"magical work\" is merely a matter of definitionanyway, and varies according to individual conceptions and expectations. While oneperson might get all weak in the knees just by lighting a candle and muttering themantra Om, another person might be bored at a Black Mass and yearn for some strongerstuff. Ceremonies alone do not make something magic. Surely the average Freemasonexperiences a number of rituals throughout his life that would make the more sensitiveamong us tremble in our boots; however, these are not done specifically to influence theway of things, but rather at most to create or open up certain states of consciousness andlevels of development.

WAS THIS ORDER REALLY SOSIGNIFICANT? I THINK THAT MOST OF THE INFORMATION THAT ISAVAILABLE ABOUT THEIR TEACHINGS IS QUITE OLD-FASHIONED, OVERLYCOMPLICATED, AND DOGMATIC. OR DO YOU FEEL OTHERWISE?SIMON F. FROM T.Dear Simon,In answer to your question as to whether the Golden Dawn really was so significant,there is only one simple answer: yes, yes, yes! No doubt you are familiar with theLesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram. And you have probably heard of the fourelemental weapons of magic-the chalice, sword, wand, and pentacle. Those are just twoexamples of the great influence that the Golden Dawn has had on contemporary magic.But there is a whole lot more. Although I hear again and again from people who seem tothink that the Pentagram Ritual is as old as time itself, I unfortunately have todisappoint them. This ritual as we know it today was developed by the Golden Dawn.And before this order existed, no one even knew that the four suits of the Minor Arcanacould also be used in practical ritual magic. This, too, was an invention of the GoldenDawn.Yet I am not saying that this order did not fall back on older sources, too. In fact, itsmain contribution consists of exactly that-the members of the Golden Dawn collectedmaterial from a variety of different disciplines and combined it. The leading figurebehind all of this was Samuel Liddell \"MacGregor\" Mathers, founder and later soleleader of the order. He was a colorful and eccentric character, surely one of the mostsignificant self-taught magicians of his time, though also one of the greatestmegalomaniacs. In my opinion, his achievements are equal to those of Agrippa.In this sense, I need to correct you in your comment about the Golden Dawn"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"supposedly being dogmatic and antiquated. Admittedly, when we page through some ofthe documents today, much of the material seems hopelessly outdated and may eventurn us off. How many modern magicians like rituals with antiquated Anglican ChurchEnglish that take hours to perform and deliver at best only meager results? And theconstant secrecy can really get on your nerves after a while. But it would be wrong tothrow out the child along with the bathwater and measure everything according to thestandards of current times. I would even go so far as to say that the mere fact that youare interested in magic at all stems back to the groundwork once laid by the GoldenDawn.Now let us take a brief look at the magical situation in the 1800s. That was a timewhen the hardliners of the rational sciences boldly claimed to have finally bumped offreligion and all other forms of so-called irrationalism once and for all. Some thought itwould be just a matter of a few decades or one or two generations before the \"opiate ofthe people\" would have worn itself out. The world is a clockwork-that was the motto ofthis era. The enormous progress that had been made in sciences such as physics,chemistry, medicine, and even engineering all contributed to the idealization of thismotto. Occultism was entirely on the defensive. What was once knowledge that wasreserved exclusively for the ruling class was suddenly degraded to the \"metaphysics ofstupid guys\" (Adorno). The ultimate explanation of the world seemed just momentsaway from discovery. Occultism was out, and magic was considered to be utterlyimpossible. Nonetheless, Francis Barrett published his work The Magus in 1801, andeven if people are still talking about it today, it was little more than a collection of latemedieval hocus- pocus, and quite incomplete at that.Of course, there were counter-movements as well. We can safely forget about thereligious revivalist movement that flared up all over the world back then, regardless ofthe fact that occultists later recruited members from this scene, just as they do today aswell. Rosicrucianism was more significant, however, especially in England and France,for producing such illustrated figures as Bulwer-Lytton and paving the way for theGolden Dawn. Preliminary work was done above all by Eliphas Levi, who put forthgreat efforts to make magic intellectually acceptable again, and his student and/orsuccessor Papus, who successfully advanced to the position of occult advisor to CzarNicholas II's court. There was bustling activity among the Parisian bohemians as well,with figures such as Stanislas de Guaita and Josephin Madan stirring up quite a storm."},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"But it was Mathers who knew how to interpret the signs of the time by founding theGolden Dawn, thus presenting a system that was complicated and comprehensiveenough to meet the high expectations of erudite intellectuals who were sick and tired ofManchester industrialism and were on the lookout for a new spiritual home.Influences of the Golden Dawn can be recognized in every documented form ofWestern magic from the 1900s onward. As Papus discovered the Jewish Kabbalah forthe tarot while indulging endlessly in highly complicated gematric and numerologicalspeculations, Mathers complemented this with his concept of astral travel (\"rising upthrough the levels\") and practical Kabbalistic pathworking, thus creating acomprehendible form of practice. While the teachings of the Indian tattwas remainedpurely theoretical in Theosophy, the Golden Dawn used this concept for its astraltravels. Although a clear distinction has been made since ancient times between thefunctions of an amulet and those of a talisman, and although there is early evidence ofplanetary magic being practiced as well, it was the Golden Dawn that understood how toturn it into a coherent system with fundamental principles that still apply today.Mathers studied massive amounts of old material, adapting it to fit the times helived in and adding his own ideas. However, the result was not what we know as ancienthermetic magic, but rather a variation of it a la the Golden Dawn. English and Germanauthors kept rehashing the Golden Dawn system from the mid- 1800s onward, with itsclimax in the 1970s and 1980s, and although the wave of German occultism remainedindependent of the Golden Dawn at first, such literature later influenced it much morethan anything else.You might shrug this off as a purely historical phenomenon, but then please tell mehow you would go about studying Enochian magic without drawing from the sources ofthe Golden Dawn?One helpful hint: try to not let the old-fashioned style of the Golden Dawn botheryou so much, and focus instead on recognizing the basic structures that are relevant toyour own personal practice. Surely you can find the essential practical material of theGolden Dawn system in literature by other authors where it is explained much moreprecisely and understandably.

IS THEREREALLY SUCH A THING AS SATANISTS ANYWAY? CAN YOU HELP?ELFRIEDE H. FROM B.Dear Elfriede,Sigh, that's what I was afraid of! Well, well, my dear, many a poor old witch has askedthis question herself: is there even such a thing as Satanism? But first a few words aboutthe current media hype. It certainly is possible that seances are sometimes held atschools, with table-rapping, automatic writing, and other types of spirit conjuration, butmost incidents are probably meant more as a joke. Of course, sensationalist journalismloves things like that and publishes them big. Then dear little children everywhere areapproached by their parents about these horrible fairy tales (\"Do you have things likethat at your school, too, dear?\") and think to themselves, \"That's an awesome idea! Weshould try that out!\"Do not accuse me of playing the situation down, though. After all, the theory that so-called \"juvenile Satanism\" is being systematically hyped by the media was recentlyconfirmed to me by a religious-cult advisor who, by the way, takes the whole thing a lotless seriously than a vehement atheist of a more rationalistic nature might do.But in reality, dear Elfriede, you are actually looking for \"true,\" \"genuine\" Satanistswho have truly earned their reputation, right?

And how they had to erect their chapelsand cathedrals right on top of the sites that were previously used by other \"devilish\"cults to perform their \"dirty little deeds.\" One can never please such simple souls, and ifyou want to define Satanism like that, then there are of course plenty of Satanists outthere.But how do those people who consider themselves to be true Satanists view this?Well, since you don't run into them every afternoon at your favorite cafe, we are forcedto fall back on the various forms of literature. Satanism is often defined as a form ofreversed Catholicism. And indeed this may have applied for the most part to salonSatanists of the late nineteenth century. Inversion is a typical characteristic of this,known back then as a \"reversal of values,\" which Nietzsche popularized into a megacultural topic. But this is always defined through a love-hate relationship with thedreadful model of the Catholic Church. For example, the notorious Black Mass isusually nothing more than the inversion of the Catholic High Mass. Whether the OurFather is said backwards (although I have never run into anyone who has seriouslypracticed such a perfect example of this nonsense), whether crosses are worn upsidedown, or whether the Holy Communion is desecrated by substituting it with excrementor urineeach of these would be impossible without immediate references being made tothe Catholic Church. This includes the common belief in many so-called \"Satanic\"circles that, in order for it to be effective, the Black Mass may only be performed by aformer Catholic priest who turned disloyal or was suspended.With the key word inversion, we have already identified the basic principle ofSatanism fairly well. After all, there is a good reason why Satan is known as \"the spiritthat ever denies.\" In this sense, he is the necessary complement to or antagonist of thegood God of creation that we are familiar with in a deistic or monotheistic world viewWasn't it Lucifer who once proclaimed, \"Non serviam!\"?Pete Carroll and Frater U.•. D... have often pointed out that a Black Mass held inmodern times should actually contain entirely different elements instead of just trying"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"to break down ancient, crumbling doors that have already been wide open for a goodhundred years in the first place. In this sense, magicians described as Satanists shouldbe less concerned with turning Christian symbols of martyrdom upside down and moreconcerned with slamming a brick into the television set during the international soccerfinals. They should recite stock market prices and weather forecasts backwards insteadof attacking the Bible, which they probably know virtually nothing about anyway. WhatI just said about the Black Mass applies, of course, mutatis mutandis, to Satanism as awhole.But the true magician wants a whole lot more. Since his or her real concern isalways just magic and power, which can be more loosely defined as \"efficiency,\" themagician is never satisfied with confirming the existing world order by provoking it.That only causes a stalemate instead of dissolving something, as every revolution hasalways proved over and over again. But when the spirit of opposition is taken one stepfurther, its tender roots will soon wrap around solid rocks. Then the magician is nolonger satisfied with things such as gravity or the complicated process of metabolism.Not that these and other such things have already been mastered, but at least one neverstops trying to do so. In this sense, the magician can never really be anything other thana \"Satanist\" if he or she accordingly wants to assume sole control of his or her life andwhat we refer to as destiny. The fact that this has nothing at all to do with the Satanismthat we hear about in the media should be obvious. In the same way, such Satanists alsohave nothing at all to do with magic; after all, their persistent hate and rejection oforthodox systems only serves in making these systems even more powerful, thusachieving just the opposite of their original intentions.With jet-black greetings,Your Aunt Klara"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"DEAR AUNT KLARA! LATELY THERE HAVE BEEN ARTICLES EVEN INCONVENTIONAL MAGAZINES ABOUT SIGIL MAGIC. PLUS, THERE ARE LOTSO F BOOKS AVAILABLE ON THE SUBJECT TODAY: FOR EXAMPLE, AHANDBOOK BY FRATER U.S. D.•. Now, SIGIL MAGIC IS SUPPOSEDLY SO PLAINAND SIMPLE-SO SIMPLE, IN FACT, THAT THE BASICS COULD EASILY BEEXPLAINED ON A SINGLE SHEET OF PAPER. WHY THE FLOOD OFPUBLICATIONS THEN? IS IT ALL JUST A MONEY-MAKING SCAM, OR ISTHERE MORE TO SIGIL MAGIC THAN MEETS THE EYE?PETER D. FROM H.My dear Peter,To say \"lots of books\" is a bit of an exaggeration, especially in comparison to thenumber of books available on other subjects, such as protective magic, healingtechniques, or the making of talismans.But generally speaking, you are quite correct. Sigil magic is so plain and simple thatthe basic principles really can be summarized in just a few words: write down yourstatement of intent, create a graphic sign from the letters after crossing out those thatare repeated, and charge it spasmodically in a state of trance-that is the simple formulafor sigil magic. Oh, and don't forget to forget about it!But that is the snag to the whole thing. Generally, a successful magical operationdoes not even require such a \"complicated\" procedure as making a sigil. One of themany empty-handed techniques is \"quick thinking,\" in which a thought is brieflyformulated but not pursued any further, and then immediately forgotten. I am sure youare familiar with this from everyday life situations, and that such situations usually turnout negatively-for example, when you park in a no-parking zone, get out of the car, andthink for a split second, \"I hope I don't get a ticket.\" But of course, when you return tothe car there is a ticket under the windshield wipers."},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"Magical disciplines such as \"positive thinking\" have disguised the actual problem abit by claiming that the negative nature of such thoughts is the only reason that they aremanifested. But the same thing can happen with positive thoughts, too. For example,you think briefly about a friend and express the desire, \"I hope he calls me soon\"-andthen the phone rings. Of course, it will often be exactly that friend, even if you haven'theard from him in years. But we could explain such things as simple \"divination\" or\"telepathy,\" too. Indeed this brings up the further question as to whether many so-calledmagical acts are possibly nothing more than an expression or manifestation oftelepathically received impulses. In other words, you might sense that your friend wantsto call you and formulate this feeling into a desire. Neither theory can be proved,though, at least not in a scientific sense, since we simply do not know enough about thetruly relevant factors.What I am trying to make clear with this little excursus is that even in sigil magic,the last word has definitely not been spoken yet. After all (cross your heart), aseveryone knows, creating the sigil itself is the least of our problems. More often thannot, the real problem is truly forgetting about the whole operation. In addition, everysigil magician realizes sooner or later that he or she automatically develops his or herown techniques, thus eventually creating one's own personal form of sigil magic. Thatshould clear up the question as to why so much can be written about such a seeminglysimple discipline.Often we forget that sigil magic is an integral part of the magical system fromAustin Osman Spare, who liked to decorate his own pictures and graphics with sigils.Austin Osman Spare created a self-sufficient \"alphabet of desire,\" introduced theshamanic principle of working with atavisms to Western magic (again), systematicallyexpanded on the Freudian concept of repression for magical purposes (thus thesignificance of forgetting), and made numerous other contributions to magic, makinghim all the more fascinating.Every sigil-magical operation touches on the question of the immanent effectivenessof magical symbols. In more dogmatic types of magic, it was previously commonplaceto assume that certain objectively effective protection symbols should be used, such asthe pentagram, cross, hexagram, circle, and so on. Both psychological and pragmaticforms of magic have challenged this dogma, however, with their practitioners insisting"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"that a symbol cannot become effective until it is programmed into the magician'ssubconscious.

I'VE READ A LOT ABOUT THE FRATERNITAS SATURNIIN OLDER PUBLICA- TIONSf AND UNFORTUNATELY NOT ALL OF IT HASBEEN GOOD. THERE ARE LOTS OF RUMORS FLOATING AROUND. FOREXAMPLE, THE ORDER WAS SUPPOSEDLY DISSOLVED IN THE i970S. ANDALLEGEDLY THERE ARE SEVERAL ORDERS OPERATING UNDER THE SAMENAME. SOME PEOPLE CLAIM THAT THE OLDER MEMBERS OF THEBROTHERHOOD USE THE ORDER AS A MERE RESERVOIR FOR \"FRESH 00 \"1AND THAT THEY FEED OFF THE NEWER MEMBERS LIKE VAMPIRES. I THINKTHIS ALL SOUNDS PRETTY OUTRAGEOUS, SO I THOUGHT I WOULD ASK IFYOU HAVE ANY MORE INFORMATION ON THE SUBJECT.SABINE F. FROM C.Dear Sabine,Yes, there are a lot of rumors out there about the Fraternitas Saturni, and outrageouscertainly is a good word to describe them. Of course, the order is not entirely innocentin this matter. In the 1960s in particular it was surrounded by a great deal ofcontroversy. During this period, there was lots of nitpicking and pedantry of a typemore characteristic to a group of rabbit breeders, and someone was constantly beingexcommunicated. That absorbed most of the members' energy, and nothing trulyinnovative for modern magic resulted from this period.The fluctuation of members was always quite high, even stemming back to the earlydays when the order was founded by Gregor A. Gregorius, as can be read in the officialannouncements in the publication Blotter fur angewandte okkulte Lebenskunst (Journalfor Applied Occult Life Mastery). In some years, fluctuation was even as high as 50"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"percent, and the fact that the FS (as we'll refer to it) had over a hundred members attimes did not help-although this is a pretty high number for any German order! In anycase, the order had masters and even grandmasters who mercilessly sold off parts of theinternal archives, or let themselves be tricked by equally conniving archive hunters andoccult bibliomaniacs who robbed them of the treasures that they were entrusted with.Plus, schisms (end even splitoff organizations) were commonplace, as were legalquarrels and dogmatic appeals; in fact, the systematic persecution of dissentiousoutsiders was a major factor that contributed to the FS's reputation, which follows iteven today.But back to your questions. Yes, I can tell you a bit about the FS, but please do notask me to reveal my source of information (which I can assure you is highly reliable).Following its reestablishment at the end of World War II, the order has existedcontinually since then as a legally registered society. (The FS was banned during theNazi regime, as were all occult organizations. In fact, Gregorius himself waspersecuted. He fled to Italy but was handed back over to Germany by Mussolini'sregime and ended up in \"preventive detention\" for roughly one year.) Contradictoryclaims of certain schisms had only one goal in mind-to be able to decorate their ownsecret organizations with the fascinating name Fraternitas Saturni. This is a legallyestablished fact, because in the early 1980s a further split-off occurred, and a neworganization began to call itself \"Fraternitas Saturni\" until a court order required themto stop.The Fraternitas Saturni follows the same clever policy as the Vatican-namely, toneither publicly confirm nor deny anything at all. In the same way, the order (which is alegal entity) took no legal action against Werner Schmitz when he presented them aslittle more than a pornography and blackmail undertaking in his novel Auf Teufelkomm raus. The dignified behavior on the part of the order was surely a clever move,since denial and legal action would only provide fuel for the fire. By ignoring theclaims, they naturally faded from the public eye.The headquarters of the \"lodge\" (as the group calls itself) is located in Berlin again,and not in the Frankfurt region as it was for many years in the past."},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"The FS has undergone a thorough transformation over the last few decades. Theaverage age of the members has drastically dropped, which naturally has an effect onthe group's practical work. A merger with another magical order has taken place as well,which expanded membership and added even more young members.Principally, the FS does not canvass for new members-not because they are trying tohide something, but rather because they hold the opinion that everyone who is supposedto find their way to the order will do so eventually on his or her own. Besides, fromwhat I hear, they place a lot more value on quality than on quantity. The practicaltraining that a neophyte receives is much more rigorous than it was in the past, andsince capacities are limited as far as qualified trainers go, they are not interested ininitiating more people than they can take care of.I am not familiar enough with the order's history to exclude the possibility thatvampirism might have once been practiced. If you look at the style of what Michael D.Eschner described as \"old-man occultism of the 1920s,\" this accusation might not be allthat far-fetched. But my personal respect for the old men in the FS is not sufficientenough to deem them truly capable of such feats.It is much more likely that this is all just a misunderstanding, something thatprobably affects all traditional orders, and not just the FS. In line with the spirit modelof magic, every organization creates its own \"group spirit,\" which can also be called an\"egregore.\" However, the FS is one of the very few groups that has actually integratedthis fact systematically into its grade system and training plan. Practical work with theegregore is one of the central themes in the order today, which in turn brings us back tothe allegations of vampirism. After all, an egregore is nothing but an entity createdmore or less artificially and intentionally from group energies. Such an entity lives offof this energy, which can be applied in the interest of the group, whether for protectionfrom prosecution or for other common goals. With the wink of an eye, this might becalled \"vampirism,\" because an egregore-and this cannot be stressed enough-is not aprotective spirit that is appointed to an organization by some higher authority. Instead,it is more of a collective product that is created by the group itself, but one that also hasa certain degree of autonomy. So it is only logical that all members of the group are\"tapped into\" by this entity, whether they realize it or not."},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"You can probably tell what I am getting at here, but in any case, I am not trying tode-demonize the term vampirism. In the same way, you could claim with the samelegitimacy that a talisman you charged is vampirizing you as long as you allow it to beeffective. Or you might call the treasurer of any organization a \"vampire,\" as somepeople like to do (ha ha!).However, if you take a look at the careers of some of the old masters of the FS, youwill not get the impression that they could have accomplished great things as vampires.On the contrary, every grandmaster of the order to this day has endured the severity ofthe Saturnian current to its fullest-and that is what the FS focuses on in the first place.So it would be more accurate to say that all members feed the egregore and the job ofthe masters is, at most, to work with this entity on a magical-ceremonial level in thegroup's interest, to \"handle\" it in a sense and to use it for the lodge.Of course, a handful of young occultists still think of the FS as a collection oflascivious, drooling old men who stretch their long, sticky fingers out to grope at thelegs of sexy young initiates. But I am afraid that anyone who tries to contact the lodgefor exactly this reason will be bitterly disappointed.Whoever wants to become a member of the FS today is subject to a rigorousselection procedure that stretches over a fairly long period of time. The selection isnarrowed down already during the early stages, and even if a candidate receives apositive response following an interview, it usually takes at least a year before thecandidate is finally initiated into the lodge. While many other orders follow the oldGerman government policy of \"time will sort things out, and the more time the better,\"and award grades and degrees by mail, the earned degrees in the FS actually have to beearned just like in the O.T.O. On another note, a few years ago the FS launched afinancial tour de force and succeeded in buying back a large portion of its formerpossessions. In my opinion, these are all indicators that we are no longer dealing with aweak organization whose members are fighting amongst themselves, as the rumorsmight indicate.Most orders have their ups and downs, and the FS is certainly no exception.

I don't think that would be avery good idea anyway, since it would most likely be far off the mark of what youactually want to know.It is common for every new generation to feel much more clever and advanced thanthe one before it. This is merely a reflection of the individual's development in breakingaway from the parents and family in social terms. After all, the generational conflicttakes place outside the home as well. Plus, it is always difficult to judge a past era whennot much time has elapsed since its end. The process of breaking away, which can oftenlead to an outright revolution, is too fresh in our memories, and thus we can oftenobserve how the grandchildren take over the positions of their grandparents withoutnecessarily being reactionary themselves, while nonetheless preferring to have theirtongues torn out than admitting in the slightest that their parents might have actuallybeen right about one thing or another. Although this is nothing new, we have to keep an"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"eye on it if we want to observe a certain period from a neutral point of view. Magic isno exception in this sense, even if I have to regretfully admit that most magicians fail torecognize this historical awareness. Some even go a bit too far and rob themselves ofthe valuable experience of applying the law of constant change (that they are so fond ofquoting) to everything imaginable except to the history of magic itself.Concerning the specific era that you mentioned, please do not expect me to beentirely neutral in my opinion; after all, this period was way too diversified and muchtoo recent to view with an objective eye. So we can only operate with approximationshere.For now, I would like to diverge a bit and take a look at magic in the 1920s inconjunction with the Black Arts at the end of the nineteenth century and the turn of thetwentieth century. After all, many of the things that began to blossom in the 1920s, butalso later, in the 1960s and 1970s, had already taken root back in the nineteenth century.Geographical displacement should be taken into consideration here as well. WhileGermany was considered to be the stronghold of the magical arts during the lateseventeenth and early eighteenth centuries (just think of the Rosicrucians and thehysteria concerning the illuminates of that period), the focus clearly shifted to Franceand England around the time of the French Revolution. Without exaggeration, we cansafely say that the impulse triggered by the Rosicrucians set the pace for all ofEuropean occultism during the early nineteenth century. Authors such as Levi andPapus placed more emphasis, however, on Jewish and Kabbalistic influences, whileBlavatsky initially delved into ancient Egypt before making a sudden turn byintroducing ancient knowledge from India into Western occultism. In the 1860s, the Foxsisters in the United States triggered an international wave of spiritualism thatdetermined the course for a large part of the magic scene (at least in theEnglishspeaking world) that lasted well into the 1920s.Since the Golden Dawn originally developed from a Rosicrucian group called theSocietas Rosicruciana in Anglia (SRIA), it was consequentially largely influenced byRosicrucian elements. Although the founding members of the Golden Dawn were allhigh-ranking Freemasons, the influence of Freemasonry was limited to the use ofMasonic symbolism."},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"Generally speaking, the situation was a bit different in Germany. Of course, therewas a bit of proliferation here and there. Particularly mentionable in this context isStaudenmaier, whom you alluded to in your question. His book Die Magic alsexperimentelle Naturwissenschaft (Magic as an Experimental Science) is, in myopinion, highly overestimated and basically a study of self-induced obsession that hasactually very little to do with active magic, but bows to coincidence and fate instead. Onthe other hand, German/ Polish occultist and writer Przybyszewski belongs to the groupof unbridled tempers. He took up the act as salon Satanist, admired pseudo-Rosicrucianssuch as Madan, Stanislas de Guaita, and other French occultists, but also wrote aboutwitchcraft and never let himself be pushed into one specific direction. And he nevercontributed anything unique to the occult practice. In this sense, he and his kind couldprobably be considered among the vast number of \"simpleminded\" occultists.Generally, though, the German occultist felt more obligated to the Masonic traditionthan to the Rosicru- dan one, even if this took the form of actually opposing it. In myopinion, Theodor Reuss and his O.T.O. were always appropriately categorized as quasi-Masonic, and no secret is made about the fact that Aleister Crowley had a soft spot forthe Rite of Memphis-Misraim. It is not really important whether or not the individualrepresentatives of German occultism in the 1920s actually were Freemasons themselvesor how they might have felt about Freemasonry. Many Masonic elements are clearlypresent anyway, such as the ritual structure in the Fraternitas Saturni-which, after all,has been one of the leading magical organizations in the Germanspeaking world since1928.On the other hand, I do not want to give the impression here that everything waspredominantly Masonic. Much more important is the fact that, although all of Germanoccultism was headed in one specific direction-if we can speak at all of one singlehomogenous direction in the first place-it was greatly influenced by strong individualpersonalities and remained rooted in the visions and charisma of these individuals. Inthe end, religion was always more important to them than magic. Musallam wanted tocreate a world religion with his Adonism, and Quintscher clung long enough to hiscoattails while never really giving up this endeavor; Tranker and the Pansophic movement also pursued plans for saving the world, just like Freemasonry and Rosicrucianismhave always done. In this sense, Quintscher's pupil Bardon-who first began publishinghis own books in the 1950s-was a most welcomed change of pace!"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"But you asked about the impact that German magic of the 1920s has on the magic oftoday. Concerning the practical aspect of magic, I don't think it has had muchsignificance at all. The magical techniques documented from that era consist ofrelatively primitive yoga elements combined with mild imagination exercises and aflood of dogmatic instructions, nearly all of which were copied from Paracelsus andAgrippa. Pansexuality, which was officially only practiced in the O.T.O., had arelatively strong influence, and traces of it can be found in many other groups. Onecould almost say that the German magicians of this era were \"obsessed\" by women. Butwith this attitude, they were merely reflecting the spirit of the times, because thissubject dominated European culture as a whole from the mid-nineteenth centurythrough roughly the end of the 1920s; at the same time, the figure of Pan waspredominant as an icon of vitality and sexual liberation.One thing is certain: Quintscher and Bardon redefined the magical arts, thusestablishing new standards that we simply cannot ignore. But the example that I oftenlike to use of magicians acquiring mediums trained to obey them is also a commonexample of the style of this entire period. However, it would be wrong to leave it at thatwith such a bitter analysis, since it sounds like I am just picking on people who are nolonger around to defend themselves.In any case, we can surely learn something from the occultism of the 1920s: namely,the ruthless determination in one's own magical operations. If we read the letters thatQuintscher wrote to Silas, we may not be particularly impressed by Quintscher's skillsbut then again, the same applies to Crowley's diaries. The more decisive factor here, inmy opinion, is that these magicians understood how to integrate the Black Arts intotheir lives in such a comprehensive way, one that could easily be described as \"holistic\"without overexaggerating. Surely you are aware of my opinion that the persecution ofthe Inquisition has never really ended. But it is an entirely different story today whenwe claim to be initiates of the magical arts during times of relative material stability ascompared to the times of Crowley, Quintscher, Gregorius, and Bardon, who werecondemned, persecuted, and at times even subjected to physical or mental violence. Justthe mere fact that they stuck to their guns under such adverse conditions is certainlyworth shedding a tear for, and even if we may not think the world of these people'smagical contributions, we should treat them with deserved respect and at least regardthem as exemplary ancestors due to their determination and integrity."},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"As far as the practical impact of occultism in the 1920s, I have already hinted at thefact that its accomplishments were not all that impressive, except for maybeQuintscher's notorious Tepa or his invention of battery magic. (Obviously I will notmention nonGerman authors here, such as Aleister Crowley and Austin Osman Spare.)When reading books from this era, one thing I notice time and again is how much effortwas put into getting just the tiniest results and how such magicians felt compelled tojudge human nature, as when Gregorius or Bardon endeavor to criticize civilizationitself, or how magicians like Tranker & Co. feel the need with all naive sincerity to(inaccurately) predict the development of humanity over the next forty years. Certainlyyou might find a valuable tidbit of practical information here and there, but is it reallyworth all the effort? I would say yes, although for entirely different reasons than youmight expect.It is also possible to learn from a bad example, so if we really want to know how notto do it, the documented history of the orders of this era are the perfect subjects ofstudy. As already mentioned, in the interest of a precise historic overview a personcould study this era endlessly. However, the practical magic of contemporary magiciansis entirely different: more relaxed and-at least in the top echelon of today's magicians-abit more radical. I think that the immediate impact of occultism from the period thatyou asked about is relatively minimal. I might even go so far as to say that it made anegative impact. After all, pragmatic magic borrows some of its most significantimpulses from the rebellion against exactly the type of dogmatism that Franz Bardonpreached in a notso-praiseworthy manner, which he in turn developed by borrowingfrom older trends on a grand scale in the 1920s.Whew, that was another five-minute discourse on the entire history of Westernmagic and related world cultures; I just hope that I was at least able to answer yourquestion. However, if you are thinking of joining an organization based on the spirit ofthe 1920s, then I would warn you to be careful, because things like that are noteveryone's cup of tea. There is a popular saying that poorly misquotes good ole Schiller:\"So look before you make a permanent commitment, you might just find somethingbetter.\"I will close for now with those golden words."},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"Yours, Aunt Klara"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"DEAR AUNT KLARA, I HAVE BEEN READING YOUR COLUMN WITH GREATINTEREST FOR QUITE SOME TIME NOW, AND I WOULD LIKE TO FINALLYASK YOU A QUESTION MYSELF. IT IS ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OFASTROLOGY. MANY MAGICIANS CONSIDER THIS ART OF INTERPRETINGTHE STARS TO BE ONE OF THE BASIC PILLARS OF ALL WESTERNESOTERICISM AND MAGIC. ON THE OTHER HAND, THERE ARE SOME WHOSPEAK QUITE UNFAVORABLY ABOUT IT (SUCH AS PETE CARROLL) ORIGNORE IT ALTOGETHER (BARDON, FOR EXAMPLE). I WOULD LIKE TOKNOW WHAT YOU THINK ABOUT THIS. MAY THE STARS ALWAYS BE ONYOUR SIDE.HARRY Z. FROM D.Dear Harry,Of course, I am flattered to hear that you are a regular reader of my column. Yes, thequestion of astrology is indeed a bit tricky, but I am actually quite happy to see thatmagicians cannot seem to always agree on this point. It not only livens things up a bit,but maybe even forces people to be a bit more open-minded. After all, nothing is moredetrimental to magic than the misconception that there is such a thing as an absolutetruth.Personally, I place a lot of value in astrology. I have studied this art for many years,at times even under the instruction of a teacher; I have become familiar with theheavens and hells that it has to offer us if we get involved with the aspect of forecastingimportant events; and I have seen what claims to accuracy it makes and how much orhow little can be said of this. And even if I rarely draw up a horoscope today, I still liketo entertain my friends sometimes at teatime with anecdotes from the art of interpretingthe stars and astral divination, and love to talk shop with astrological experts."},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"But what does astrology actually have to do with magic? You can probably tell frommy lengthy introduction, dear Harry Z.: I will be damned ... um, I mean blessed ... to betmy black un-soul to say who is right-the advocates of astrology or the opponents of thisart! Of course, I could state endless arguments pro and con for combining astrology andmagic, or give you some theoretical superstructure that would simply make you wiggleyour dogmatic ears-but who would that be helping?In the end, it all depends on one's personal experience and practice with the subject,and this varies from magician to magician. What I mean is that not every magician isequally skilled at astrology. One might have good knowledge of it, while another willnever be able to learn it in thirty years. At least that's what I hear.My own experience, on the other hand, says that there is no such thing as \"the\" art ofastrology; instead, it is always what its representatives-and enemies, too!-actually makeof it. My astrology teacher (with sixty years of experience!) once said that a good fifthof all birth charts cannot be interpreted in a truly reliable way. Some people are just soatypical that you would really have to grasp at straws to force a horoscope into the usualscheme of interpretation. A well-known Danish astrologer recently told me the samething about India's astrological system. There, some Pandits hold the opinion that,although astrology is extremely precise, it almost always fails when \"magic isinvolved\"-a very informative comment, if I do say so myself!For once I am on the same wavelength as Paul Feyerabend, when he rejects theexistence of methodological rules. There is no use in explaining things away byacknowledging the existence of various techniques. One person may refer to primarydirections while another calls them sun arcs. Some individuals are not at all contentwith the seven classical or ten modern planets; they need more, and these are evenestablished by using a pendulum at times, as the late Mr. Witte of the Hamburg Schoolof Astrology did. Some swear by the observation of transits, while others will not acceptany interpretation that doesn't take absolutely everything into consideration-such ashalf-sums, fixed stars, the Galactic Center, distanceephemerides, planetoids /asteroids,sensitive points, mirror aspects, and/or so-called hidden aspects. Even if a person iscourageous enough to question astrol ogy as a whole, he or she would first have tospecify which astrological system is actually meant."},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"In addition, people seem to react quite differently to astrological factors. While oneperson may clearly feel the slightest retrograde of Mercury or a miniscule movement ofthe moon, another might desperately attempt to avoid an accident despite a retrogradeSaturn passing over his Pluto-Mars square for the fifth time, and another may beextremely sensitive to secondary directions. Such things can also be learned, of course.It makes sense that someone who constantly deals with the planets and their influenceswill sooner or later actually be at their mercy.And that brings us to a very practical matter: if you should determine that you havea certain (natural or trained) disposition for astrology, then it can be a great help toimplement astrological facts into your magical practice. This will mainly consist ofobserving the paths of the constellations and trying to avoid unpleasant things, but youshouldn't make yourself crazy by following it too closely. A very simple comparisoncan be seen in the traditional practice of performing constructive magical operationsduring the waxing moon, while destructive operations are done during the waningmoon. Accordingly, it would be symbol-logical to perform \"dark\" operations (asopposed to \"light\" operations) during lunar or solar eclipses. And astrology is certainlyquite appropriate for planetary magic as well. After all, why shouldn't a person utilize afavorable Jupiter transit for charging a corresponding talisman? Or plan such anoperation to be performed during this transit in the first place?On the other hand, the whole thing has a snag, of course, and in my opinion that isthe reason Bardon so deliberately ignored the subject of astrology. Namely, if you makeyourself dependent on the course of the constellations through training, which somefanatics like to take to the absolute extreme at times, the apparent freedom that amagician has quickly turns into a compulsion that will cost him or her more than just alittle interest fee. What use is it if I calculate that a ritual I need within the next weekwill not work successfully from an astrological point of view until thirty-five yearsfrom now? At any rate, magic has nothing to do with astral fatalism.The practical solution is more likely to just take astrology for what it is-an auxiliaryscience that we can turn to in order to obtain information that would otherwise be muchmore difficult to access. After all, that is the only use magic has for anything anyway.Now that may sound trite, but unfortunately this tidbit is disregarded way too often"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"in everyday practice. The same thing holds true, by the way, with the limitation of theplanetary hours. I remember once that a magician friend of mine was stuck in a crisissituation and desperately needed my help and that of a few other colleagues. A fastSaturn ritual was needed. \"Do you really want to perform a Saturn ritual on a Monday?\"one of them said, although I had always regarded his magical skills with a great deal ofrespect. This example clearly shows what a double-edged sword such Hermetic (and notonly these!) tools of orientation can be. In any case, it is unquestionably better if amagician can perform his or her operations exactly when they are needed or desiredinstead of making them dependent on a self-imposed symbol-logical system that justgets in the way or possibly even condemns the operation to failure right from the start.However, I also have to say that I do not particularly think highly of the mentality ofsome magicians who feel that they can give an opinion on astrology without ever havingstudied it themselves in depth. Since you have already mentioned Pete Carroll yourself,please allow me to inform you that he had quite a negative attitude about astrology inhis book Liber Null, but since then he has toned down his opinion a bit without directlybecoming a friend of the subject. I would like to flatter myself by mentioning that Imade a contribution to his change of attitude by \"seeing\" his wife's birthday in his ownnatal chart-a true act of bravura, although I willingly admit that I am not always able toperform such fabulous feats.If a magician wants to be able to work truly independently, he or she cannot risk anytype of dependency on the phases of the moon or the time of the day. That would be acontemptuous limitation of the access that all magicians aim to gain. And thus I willcome to an end in the best chaos-magical way possible, by advising you only to believein the things that are advantageous to you, and to quickly shift your paradigm as soon asyou realize that it is taking its toll.It might be a good idea also to mention that magic owes many of its most powerfulsymbols to astrology, in particular the planetary powers that can most certainly help usmake the universe more accessible. No more, but also no less.Solomonic salutations!Your Aunt Klara"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"DEAR AUNT KLARA, IT WOULD BE NICE IF YOU COULD GIVE ME YOUROPINION ON SPIRITISM. I HAVE NOTICED THAT MOST MAGICIANS SEEM TOVIEW THIS SUBJECT WITH A BIT OF DISGUST. CROWLEY IN PARTICULARWAS ONE OF ITS WORST FIENDS. I PERSONALLY DON'T HAVE AN OPINIONON THE SUBJECT YET, AND WOULD JUST LIKE TO CONSIDER MYSELF OPEN-MINDED HERE. HOW ABOUT YOU?ANGELICA T. FROM W.Dear Angelica,Of course, my dear, everyone likes to think that they are open-minded! And yourobservations are correct: to most magicians, spiritism is so much of a nuisance that thepsychoanalytically inclined observer could interpret that as the expression ofsubconscious desires. Apart from the idiotically proud dogmatists who, in their brazenignorance, will find fault with absolutely anything occult-related, Crowley was themaster of picking on spiritism, although he could not or would not avoid confrontingthe subject forever. After all, it is commonly known that his Book of the Law wasdictated to him by the supernatural being Aiwass, whose existence he certainly couldnot deny.On the other hand, it would be wrong to generalize and put spiritism on the samelevel with the spirit model of magic. After all, dealing with the spirit world is not aninvention of fundamental Christian sects, even if spiritism often portrays itself in thismanner. Rather, it has always been the daily bread of the shamans, and that still holdstrue today around the world. That is why you should take the time to examine the actualreasons behind this general rejec tion of spiritism. But that can be done fairly quicklyand easily."},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"Most magicians understand \"spiritism\" to be the summoning of dead souls, althoughit is immaterial to them whether or not these souls actually exist. But magic has its ownform of spiritism, too, except that there is a more elegant name for it here-necromancy.This is understood as the summoning of the dead for magical or divinatory purposes.But in all honesty, I really cannot see any difference between spiritism and necromancyapart from the actual procedures used. However, in order to be fair I should mentionthat most magicians radically reject necromancy right along with spiritism. Thespectrum of arguments ranges from \"One should leave the dead in peace\" to theenlightened comment \"Superstitious nonsense!\"-and everything else in between.But in my opinion, the main reason for the rejection of spiritism since the turn of thetwentieth century seems to be Christianity itself. Even back during the Renaissance, itwas the good practice of every magician to summon the spirits of the dead into his orher temple, and in doing so, it was popular practice to call upon well-knownpersonalities. That has hardly changed throughout the years in all cultures throughoutthe world-even among the shamans.Spiritism is surely as old as humanity itself, but the form that we know it as today isa product of the nineteenth century, more specifically of Protestant piety. After takingroot in the United States, like many other disastrous things, it managed to find a newhome-strangely enough, in staid, sober-minded England. There it was integrated intoeveryday religious life by Christian groups that were formally considered unorthodox,but in reality were quite conformist. Many magicians today are completely unaware thatArthur Conan Doyle, the inventor of Sherlock Holmes and an honest British gentlemanborn and bred (though being born a Catholic in Anglican England made him apermanent social outsider and a potential underdog), was actually one of the mostsignificant figures of spiritism around the time of the First World War-something thatAleister Crowley naturally held against him.This specific form of spiritism that prefers to call itself \"spiritualism\" is, in myopinion, nothing more than a religiously cloaked romanticism of the afterlife. Eventoday, one can take part in public sessions of the Spiritualist Association of GreatBritain that are held regularly at London's Belgrave Square. The former president of thisgroup-namely, Tom Johanson-was ironically a student of Austin Osman Spare (at leastduring the 1980s, according to my knowledge). So the apple really does not fall far from"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"the tree!In addition, spiritism was unfortunately haunted by a plague of charlatanism aroundthe turn of the twentieth century. In an attempt to get to the bottom of the phenomenonof spirit materialization, scientists back then, who were even more naive than they aretoday, fell by the bundles into the traps of tricksters-one of the more famous swindlers,according to known evidence, being the sly Madame Blavatsky. And as one scam afteranother was exposed, there was not an intelligent soul left who wanted to be associatedwith this movement. After all, the very limited number of magicians who actually had abrain in their head almost always considered it to be way too folksy and intellectuallyinferior.This opinion is certainly vindicated when a person hears one of the many trivialitiesthat are apparently still typical to spiritism today. Like the deceased grandfather whohappily reports from the afterlife that he can even get his favorite brand of cigars 11over there\"-and that is an unequivocally true case that has been documented!Today it is referred to by the more American but no less finer name of \"channeling,\"and in such channeling circles, there are often reports of Aleister Crowley and othersuch villains posthumously regretting their derogatory statements on the subject in asort of \"afterlife conversion.\"It may be that a sole magician here or there gets an interesting tip for his or her ownmagical practice, for all I care by tapping into the informational field of a prominentancestor of our art. But first of all, that would certainly be a diminishing minority, andsecondly, in my opinion, neither spiritism nor necromancy has ever really contributedanything significant to magic. A cynic once said, \"How do we know that the people inthe afterlife are not just as dumb as when they were alive?\" After all, death is no curefor stupidity.With ghastly greetings,Your Aunt Klara"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"DEAR AUNT KLARA, I WOULD BE MUCH OBLIGED IF YOU COULD FIND APLACE IN YOUR COLUMN TO HONOR THE CONTRIBUTION OF ELIPHAS LEVI.NOWADAYS THERE IS NOT TOO MUCH TALK ABOUT THIS ENLIGHTENEDMASTER OF MAGIC.JOHANNES M. FROM B.Dear Johannes,Let me take a good swing at the traditionalists for a change. First, let's make one thingclear: today more people talk about Eliphas Levi than actually read his works. That isno wonder, considering that what he actually had to say about magical practice is quitemeager. It appears that throughout his lifetime he only ever performed one single ritualat most-or at least he never mentions more than one (which failed by the way): namely,his conjuration of Apollonius of Tyana, a necromantic job that he performed forsomeone else during which he quickly got cold feet. Honestly, I always find it quitetiring to browse through his books. Nonetheless, he sweetens the dullness a bit bysetting many tracks that are certainly not all dead ends, which is personally quiteinteresting to me with my excellent historical background (hear, hear!).I would not view him as \"enlightened,\" but rather as a \"lighter,\" and I do not meanthat condescendingly. Try to imagine the time in which he lived: magic was dormant,rationalism flexed its freshly oiled muscles all over the place, and many an optimistthought that organized religions were nearing their end. The newest fad was CharlesDarwin, who reduced man to his basic biological measurements, which irritatedtheology immensely since it viewed its highly praised human being as both a servantand the center of all salvation. And if one could truly talk about something such aspractical magic, this was at best limited to the relatively haphazard operations of folk"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"magicians and their clients.As everyone knows, Levi himself was quite a problematic figure. By the way, he wasnot a Catholic priest in the true sense of the word-as many people claim even today,regardless of the fact that he gave himself the title of \"abbe\" (abbot). Although he wasordained into lower offices, for various reasons he never actually obtained priesthood.Like his contemporary (and even ancestor in a sense) Edgar Allan Poe, he was theprototype of \"bourgeois bohemia.\" Despite having an adversity to every type of regularactivity, he nonetheless excelled in what we know today as PR work.Let us not forget the fact that, in those days, it was improper for a gentleman or manof status (which Levi was not really, at least according to his social background) towork for his own living. But that does not mean that Levi was not diligent andindustrious. I would like to refrain from gossiping on about his biography, though, andfocus on the role that he played in magic and still does to some extent today.Levi was responsible for two great achievements. First, he made magic in generalsocially acceptable again, and second, he was one of the first to make a connectionbetween the tarot and the kabbalistic Tree of Life. If there were any forerunners for that,I am not aware of them. Of course, the speculative Kabbalah corresponded completelyto the intellectual and yet romanticized spiritual climate at the time, in general but alsospecifically in France. In his book Monde primitif, published just fifty yearsbeforehand, Antoine Court de Gebelin claimed that the tarot was the secret book ofknowledge of the ancient Egyptians (the legendary Book of Thot). And then Levi againpicked up the thread of the Hebrew aspect (which lies closer to Christianity anyway),along with the corresponding consequences that we still have to deal with today, eitherto our pleasure or dissatisfaction, depending on one's personal opinion.Beyond that, Levi was one of the first to write a summary of the history of magicthat was both comprehensive as well as appropriately coherent, albeit with a lack ofaccuracy in detail. His influence on occultists of the time can hardly be downplayed. Hewas good friends with Bulwer-Lytton, the author of such earth-shattering works asZanoni and Vril and also one of the leading figures in Britain's Rosicrucianism. Hisstudent was Papus (a.k.a. Gerard Encausse), who in turn was the occult advisor for CzarNicholas II's court. Aleister Crowley declared himself to be a reincarnation of Levi."},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"Mathers and A. E. White were also among his admirers, as were William Butler Yeatsand Rudolf Steiner. He influenced Madan as well as Przybyszewski and Guaita. Ah, thelist goes on and on!Now, there are two possible explanations for the strong influence that Eliphas Leviundeniably had on others. The first is inherent in magic and says that he was supposedlya high initiate; this is surely a convenient answer since no one is able to prove thecontrary. Personally, I like the taste of the second explanation much better. It says thatLevi was mainly an ingenious magician journalist, a synoptic visionary who understoodhow to tap the pulse of the times with immense precision and to close the gap in themarket with the perfect subject at just the right moment.This may sound derogatory, but it is not intended to be. On the contrary, I take myhat off to anyone who manages to open up so many perspectives in magic as Levi did.Even if he cannot be counted among the great practical experts of our art, given a lackof evidence to the contrary and based on the reading material in his often quite muddledand inconsistent Introduction to Magic, I nonetheless admire his ability to give themagic of his era an entirely new, mysterious, and yet easily accessible aura, allowing itto truly become alive in the imagination of his contemporaries. This is without a doubtan unparalleled pioneering venture.He has been accused of romanticizing magic, and I have to agree with this opinion.On the other hand, who didn't romanticize things back then? It was a characteristic ofthe blossoming neo-Romanticism period that reached its climax during the lateSymbolism movement at the turn of the last century. His entire work is without a doubtmore original and advanced than the highly overestimated Francis Barrett, whose bookThe Magus (published in London in 1801) is nothing more than a brewed-up Agrippa,written by a gentlemanly dilettante who knew how to make a few quick guineas.I already said that Levi's more or less \"legendary\" status is surely much larger thanthe actual number of his readers. If his writing seems a bit intricate and complicatedtoday, especially to younger magicians, then it is most certainly due in part to theclumsy translations of his works that are available to us (by the way, A. E. Waite'sEnglish translations are just as awkward as the German translations), as well as to thefact that he conveys the feeling to his readers that they might be high initiates if only"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"they could learn to read between the lines and understand the signs.There are magicians who appreciate Levi for his theory of \"astral light,\" a conceptthat comes fairly close to Bulwer's vril or Reichenbach's od, and which possibly eveninfluenced these.Indeed, this man probably deserves a lot more to be said about him, but I wouldrather wrap this up now before it turns into a doctoral thesis.

In Hallein, located in the Salzkammergut region, the company established itsmain production site-a factory that is still partially preserved today. Kellner was alsoburied in this ancient Celtic stronghold, and it is one of the ironies of the magical worldthat he lies in a Catholic grave decorated with a concealed symbol of Rosicrucianism. Itis said that he received his training in yoga from a guru in Lahore, where he supposedlyalso acquired his knowledge of Tantrism.Right next to the factory in Hallein, an inhalatorium was built that produced thecellulose waste product lignosulfite, which was then used to treat tuberculosis patients.There is hardly a more practical form of recycling! Franz Hartmann, who was havingfinancial difficulties following the decline of theosophy, was hired by Kellner to workthere as a doctor. Thus, little by little, such illustrious personalities as Lou Andreas-Salome, Gustav Meyrink, and Theodor Reuss, as already mentioned, began to meet andassemble. Kellner owned a villa in Vienna with an \"alchemistic observatory\"(laboratory?) and a tantric devotion room. A few photographs have survived from thistime, since Kellner was also a pioneer in the field of color photography.Sex magic is naturally not a modern-day invention. Just look at the templeprostitution of Babylonia and India, the pre-Aryan Tantrism of the Dravidians, thecountless fertility rites in all world cultures, the ophi- tish sperm gnosis, the Ortlibiansand the Brethren of the Free Spirit of medieval times, certain Jewish and Islamic (inparticular Sufi) practices, and maybe even the alleged (and speculative) sexual rites ofthe Knights Templar-sex magic flourished just about everywhere. The O.T.O., however,is an exception, in that it is an obliged brotherhood with structures and symbols similarto that of Freemasonry.It might also be interesting to note that Kellner thought himself to be thereincarnation of a Babylonian fire priest. An \"occult club\" then came into being inVienna, which was the forerunner of the O.T.O. and only accessible to high-rankingMasons from the Rite of Memphis-Misraim. They also maintained contact with theVienna branch of the Brotherhood of Luxor, which practiced sex magic as well. Thatmakes an interesting link to Aleister Crowley, who was still a member of the GoldenDawn at the time. Within this British order, another inner circle had formed aroundCrowley's good friend Frank Harris, who also maintained contact with the Brotherhood"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"of Luxor. This brotherhood is an order founded by Paschal Beverly Randolph, a mixed-race American from New York who was also the author of Magia sexualis, a book onthe subject of sex magic that was quite revolutionary for its time, yet is, in my opinion,also highly overrated. Viennese artist and satanologist Josef Dvorak had read Czechtranslations of Randolph's work, as he once personally told me. These volumes, whichwere printed in Prague, were repeatedly put on the index of disapproved books by thepolice in the region around the Austrian border. Nonetheless, at least one state-censorededition was published in Vienna as well.Francis King pointed out the highly underrated role that Edward Sellon played inVictorian England through the propagation of Tantrism and Arabicinfluenced sexmagic. Another significant orientalist was Sir Richard Francis Burton, who was greatlyadmired by Crowley. He was an expert in the field of erotic literature of the East as wellas a talented translator, among other things. Unfortunately, very little practical materialremains of Burton's works because his widow destroyed all of his \"risque\" manuscriptsafter his death, an act that made Crowley absolutely furious.The sex-magic and mystical currents in America have apparently been criminallyneglected as well. In their biography of Reuss, Helmut Moller and Ellic Howe refer tothe lesser known Reverend Kenneth Sylvan Launfal Guthrie (such names happen to beallowed in the land of unlimited opportunities). This man seems to have rediscoveredfor himself the Indian and Chinese practices of tantra and inner alchemy without anyknowledge of their Eastern origins. His book Regeneration: The Gate of Heaven waspublished in 1897. He also founded the \"Brotherhood of the Eternal Covenant,\" whichadvertised to help seekers \"find the right path to sexualistic vitalism,\" as Moller andHowe put it. Of course, there were other libertine currents that prevailed in the UnitedStates, at least for a while, despite-or maybe because ofthe general puritan mood ofsociety at the time, the most significant of these being the quasi-anarchistic OneidaCommunity, as well as numerous other religiously disguised splinter groups.Now Freemasonry, of course, was often accused by its opponents of implementingunspeakable sexual practices-ancient persecution tactics that have prevailed well beforethe witch-hunts and the wiping out of the Order of the Knights Templar. Still, eventoday there is no absolute certainty (although it is quite likely) that the libertinisticgnosis really did exist during the age of early Christianity. The accounts of gnostic"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"orgies and other sexual excesses in a ritualistic context stem for the most part from theChristian enemies of the gnostics.But it is not my intention to go into that here. I think it is much more important tonote that the O.T.O. was a quasi-Masonic association that had close ties to the Rite ofMemphis-Misraim, which Crowley regarded quite highly. Also, the O.T.O. adopted sexmagic in a ritually formalized way that led to the development of its own unique style;and of course it was the O.T.O. that publicly propagated this discipline as well. So inCrowley's autobiography, when he pretends he was entirely inexperienced in the field ofsex magic until he had met Reuss and through him first learned of the great significanceof sexuality in magic, then that is either a downright lie or at least a bit twisted in truth.As has been pointed out a few times before, it's also a bit strange that he did notmention Arthur Avalon in any of his books. After all, Avalon-whose real name was SirJohn Woodroffe-was a justice of the peace in India in his day as well as a highlyrespected researcher of Tantrism. It seems next to impossible that Crowley was notaware of Woodroffe's works (e.g., on kundalini yoga, chakra letter magic, and modernBengali Tantrism) that were published around the turn of the twentieth century. Afterall, if there ever were a truly sharp-eyed observer on the scene who also had thenecessary leisure time to pursue every aspect of his discipline, then it was surelyAleister Crowley. On the other hand, it is difficult to understand why he would haveconcealed such an influence, or at least the acknowledgment thereof. Because Crowleywas not at all the type to conceal his sources.In any case, dear Franz, you are entirely correct in pursuing this matter. We haveseen that there is still a lot of roadwork to be done here. So if you would like to combineinstinct with scholarship (and a leaden butt for studying the vast amount of literature!),then those of us historically interested in the magic scene would certainly be quitegrateful. In any case, I can safely say already that the early O.T.O. must have had strongAmerican influences, in particular in the field of sex magic. One thing that strikes me asstrange, though, is the fact that Crowley never mentions Randolph (who was anAmerican) at all, at least to my knowledge.I am truly sorry if I have made the whole matter more complicated for you, but youreally cannot hold me responsible for the lack of available resources.

I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW MORE ABOUT THE EXACTFUNCTION OF BURNING INCENSE DURING RITUALS. WOULD YOU BE ABLETO HELP ME?ELFRIEDE P. FROM G.Dear Elfriede,Your question is a bit vague, but let me see what I can do. Actually the answer is quitesimple: incense puts the magician into a certain frame of mind that is commonly knownas gnosis, or magical trance. When using certain mixtures (such as planetary incenseand the like), the intention is to stimulate the related psychomagical associations, thusactivating the corresponding powers. Maybe you already know that the sense of smellhas a direct connection to the oldest part of the brain-namely, the brain stem, or \"lizard\"brain. This is why scents and smells can lead to fairly predictable reactions whenskillfully applied by knowledgeable persons. That is how the perfume industry makes aliving, and not a bad one at that!The smoke can also be used for cleansing and purification, such as is done duringCatholic rites and in Asian temples. However, I cannot tell you what the 'Wright\"substance is to use for which purpose, since this field in particular places no value instandardizing hermetic tradition. In nine out of ten cases, experts will categorize oneand the same substance into principally different groups or powers. That is why it isimportant here to heed the good ole basic principle of pragmatic magic: the initiate isbetter off by experimenting and creating his or her own experiences instead ofautomatically assuming someone else's ideas.Apart from cleansing and generating a state of trance (or \"creating the right mood\"),the smoke of incense can also be used for shamanic journeys. For example, it is known"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"that Siberian shamans like to use a cloud of smoke for their nonphysical travels; thiscloud is used to carry them to the desired location in the spirit world.And finally, let me mention one more function of incense. In the conjuring ofdemons, it is known that the manifestation of these scaly creatures requires at least theconsistency of thick vapors. Here, incense (sometimes called the \"sweat of the gods\" inolder texts) serves as both an offering and as a material basis for the sensory expressionin concrete terms. Even in ancient books of spells, one can find indications of how toproject images of demons from the altar into a column of smoke by using a system ofmirrors that resembles a projector. That was not intended to be a trick of deception,though. After all, who would be able to deceive someone this way in the long term?Instead, it served to aid visualization because of the way the smoke wavers and canbring an image to life when cleverly projected onto it.Many magicians use incense as a signal for the start of a trance (or the shift to adifferent one) and design their rituals accordingly. In this way, planetary incense wouldbe used immediately before the particular planetary powers are invoked, while beforeand after that a general, cleansing mixture could be used.But in the end, incense mixtures are merely tools of magic just like daggers, swords,chalices, pentacles, wands, and even the temple itself, and a magician should be carefulnot to become too dependent on these.With fragrant greetings,Your Aunt Klara"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"DEAR AUNT KLARA, FOR QUITE SOME TIME NOW I HAVE BEEN TRYING TOSEPARATE MY ASTRAL BODY BY USING THE FOLLOWING METHOD: I LIEFLAT ON MY BACK, BREATH DEEPLY AND SLOWLY, AND ENTER A STATE OFDEEP RELAXATION, AS I LEARNED TO DO THROUGH AUTOGENIC TRAINING.THEN I TRY TO SEPARATE MY ASTRAL BODY FROM MY PHYSICAL BODYUNTIL IT FLOATS ROUGHLY A FOOT AND A HALF ABOVE ME.

FROM B.Dear Sigurd,Lots of magicians struggle with the same problem, beginners in particular. That maynot offer much consolation, but maybe I have some tips that will help. The techniqueyou described for astral travel is surely the most common. For some people it works injust a short time, but not for everyone. That may be due to insufficient imaginationtraining, but of course that does not help the affected person very much.Maybe you could try the following exercise instead: Determine a location that youwant to visit astrally. Instead of lying down, sit in a comfortable position. (As with anytype of astral work, it is important here that you make sure that you will not bedisturbed. Because if a dear family member bursts into the room or the dachshundinsists on being let outside, this can have a subtle yet long-lasting negative effect onyour practice.) Now expand your body roughly half an inch with each breath. This isdone only in the imagination, is fairly easy to do, and often produces fast results.When you have expanded to roughly twice your normal size, continue the process"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"with even greater dimensions. Inches become feet, and feet become miles, and so on.Don't worry too much about the actual act of leaving your body, since that's not what itis really about. After all, a person usually wants to travel astrally in order to perform asort of remote divination-e.g., to determine what a good friend is currently doing for thepurpose of remote healing. Therefore, remember that it is not necessarily all about theastral body. Personally, I tend to speculate that this ominous astral body is nothing morethan a myth at best, one that makes it easier for us to tap into specific information fromoften faraway, remote sources.One variation of this technique consists of proceeding little by little. For example,the first few times you would only move your astral arms out of your physical body, abit later your whole upper body and head, and so on. But if you really only want to findout how your friend in the Canary Islands is doing, then always keep in mind thatobtaining this remote information is your actual goal, regardless of how you get there,and not necessarily the act of buzzing around in an astral body. That should at leastprevent any type of tension or grim determination.Experienced magicians often do without astral travel altogether, since it iscomparatively complicated whereas the desired information can often be obtained muchfaster and easier. However, this does not mean that a person should renounce astraltravel altogether. On the contrary, this practice often leads to a greater exposure to whatwe like to call \"intuition,\" for lack of a better word and without truly understanding itsorigin.This concept of having various human bodies, which was borrowed from theosophy,is surely a useful tool that everyone can relate to fairly well. But that's still no reason tocling to it for eternity. Therefore, formulate your goals specifically. Determine foryourself what it is that you actually want to achieve, and if your practice gets dull, thenjust try something different for a while, as described here.Hovering and floating,Your Aunt Klara"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"DEAR AUNT KLARA!

I am not implying that this has alreadyhappened, and I can certainly understand that you might prefer less of a \"melting pot\"atmosphere in the magical culture of Western Europe. But please do not forget that"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"occultism, and magic in particular, has always been a reservoir for taking on the mostdiverse cultural movements. This is called syncretism. Syncretism means that, out of allthe possible trends and movements out there, a person picks and chooses only thatwhich he or she can actually use, or thinks can be used.Even back in ancient times, one could find corrupted forms of Egyptian, Sumerian,and pre-Socratic elements of magic, all colorfully mixed together with Hebrewformulas and folk magic-enough to make any culturally squeaky-clean person havesome serious fun trying to tidy up the Augean stables. When observed with the properdistance, the strict boundaries disappear and we see a single unity that is and wasactually quite heterogeneous.Today we can already observe new currents while they are in the making. Now,however, we have a different problem-namely, that it is increasingly difficult for us todetach ourselves from the system of order that we have grown so fond of, although suchdetachment is indeed necessary for the old to be able to merge with the new.But what does shamanism actually have to offer modern magic? Well, quite a bit,such as its highly advanced trance technology that makes our so-called \"consciousnessexplorers\" look like incompetent children, as well as a purely advantage-orientedpragmatism of the most radical type from which many of us could learn a few things-especially those of us who tend to flee into the world of speculation a bit too quicklyand prematurely. Indigenous tribes are not just romantic dreamers who spend the wholeday enraptured by sniffing at sweet little flowers, but instead they are practitioners ofthe first degree. At the place where dogma starts sneaking its way into the picture,decadence is already well underway, but that seems to be an indispensable side effect ofany type of \"civilization.\" When groups of people reach a certain critical mass, it isessential to have some form of management in addition to a chief. The \"shamanic\"aspect of so-called indigenous tribes is mainly the fact that the sorcerer holds arelatively high position within the chain of command. Later, in papal states, this chief isreplaced by a high priest.Thus it would be quite naive to define something like \"love of nature\" as acharacteristic of shamanism. When indigenous people talk about the \"good MotherEarth,\" we can be certain that they have already been corrupted by Rousseauian ideals."},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"These are so-called \"apple Indians\"-red on the outside, white on the inside. The simplepreservation of an ecological balance in the interest of one's own survival is an entirelydifferent thing. There is nothing \"lovely\" about that, yet it provides all the more access.But we should get back to talking about shamanism now and its significance tomagic. I will start with the magical-trance techniques already mentioned above that hadbeen long forgotten in the Western tradition. Right up through the 1970s, the magicalliterature of our civilization contains the formula \"magic = will + imagination,\" whichcan be used to easily explain such baby-soft magical techniques as \"positive thinking.\"But through our contact with shamanism (or neo-shamanism, to be more specific), wenow have to extend this formula by the factor of \"trance\" or \"altered state ofconsciousness.\" Our interest in the drug practices of the indigenous tribes certainlycontributed to this.We have also long forgotten about the natural and even routine way that magic ispracticed in shamanic cultures. The key phrase integration of magic into everyday lifeshould be enough to illustrate what I mean by this. In places where shamanism is still\"genuine,\" it is always pragmatically oriented. No tribal sorcerer would have secondthoughts about a sentence such as The main thing is that it works, as opposed to manyhermetic/kabbalistic magicians who are searching endlessly for an absoluteness that isnever more closely defined. From this point of view, working with shamanism hascertainly shaken up dogmatic positions, razed castles to the ground, and torn downprotective walls that would have otherwise imprisoned us in a system of efficiencyavoidance.By the way, society's modern conflict about the distribution of raw materials isdefinitely not a foreign concept to shamanism. In earlier days, it was about the securingof hunting grounds, pastures, arable land, and the like. In this sense, true shamanismputs a lot more emphasis on power than documented Western magic does, with theexception of the evocation of demons. Presumably, all magic can be derived fromprimeval hunting sorcery, as it was mainly about ensuring one's own survival, takingover territory, and expanding one's range of access. It goes without saying that weathermagic obviously played an important role in the earliest of times, just as everything elsedid that we now describe with the trendy term survival."},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"The cultural denseness that we can observe among so-called shamans despite all ofthe mentioned pragmatism is mainly due to the fact that the shaman has not yetmanaged to accomplish the Western process that we call \"division of labor.\" Theshaman is not only a sorcerer, but also a historian, theologian, pastor, doctor, and quiteoften the appointed judge in the community. And so it happens that the shaman, as atrue crossover artist, first has to develop appropriate rules and models of explanationfor the magically knowledgeable people he or she is responsible for. But it is a well-known fact that any true practitionerswhether they belong to indigenous tribes orcivilized nations-frequently need to abandon all dogmas and rules in cases of doubt ifthey want efficiency. That probably applies to all areas of human action, though it ismuch more apparent in the fields of magic, religion, warfare, and political realism.In summary, I would like to say that shamanism has surely shaken us out of ourreverie regardless of the many \"seminar\" side effects that may not really seem genuine.Plus, it has also opened our eyes to the significance of folk magic, which manymagicians have long denounced in their own cultural struggle, as can be seen repeatedlyin the efforts put into distancing themselves from the \"superstitions of the dumb guys.\"I certainly have no intention of transfiguring anything here. After all, when I hear suchthings I automatically think of the nice saying by Karl Kraus: \"Vox populi, voxblockhead,\" but what actually takes place in the lower levels of society's structure is attimes quite a refreshing cultural disgrace. It is more ideological and less political-anarchy in its pure form. So regardless of whatever those learned gentlemen in theirkabbalistic/hermetic libraries come up with and proclaim to be the absolute truth, ashepherd in the remote mountains will still cuddle a fetish, the village witch will stillwhisper spells over the warts of clients, and people will still bury mandrake at thecrossroads at midnight, or hang horseshoes over doorways to protect lightning fromstriking, and so on.And finally, there is one more connection between primeval shamanism and modernmagic that should not be underestimated. I am talking about the work with atavisms aspopularized in the West by Austin Osman Spare. It is a well-known fact that Sparehimself admitted to being initiated into magic as a child by an old witch namedPeterson. And anyone who examines Spare's idiosyncratic system a bit more closelywould certainly feel inclined to believe him. Work with animals and animal powers,with animal trance and animal relics, has clearly always been typical of shamanism."},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"Such concepts could only rarely be found in advanced civilizations, such as in ancientEgypt. The shaman makes practical use of the animal while the theologian wants toconquer it. Now, most of us know from our own experience that working with \"atavisticnostalgia,\" or \"atavistic revival\" as Spare once demonstrated, is not only extremelyeffective, but can also be a whole lot of fun. That is probably the reason why the olddogmatists of the angular tradition of magic like to turn up their nose at such things.The beginnings of the intense involvement with Spare's atavistic magic and withshamanism lie barely a decade apart, which in magical terms is hardly nothing at all.Both sprouted from the fertile ground that was fairly well cultivated by the Wiccamovement, starting in the 1950s. The interest that some people have in the NativeAmericans can also be understood as a part of this spiritual current. Without thesepredecessors to pave the way, modern-day chaos magic would have been unthinkable-afact that just may surprise a few of you!To my knowledge, chaos magic in its organized form-namely, the IOT or \"Pact\"-developed a group structure not unlike that of the Wicca tradition. This includes theautonomy of an individual temple. Possibly more significant, though, is that chaosmagic is just as group-specific and anarchic as the Wicca movement. Of course, thatshould not disguise the fact that chaos magic owes quite a bit to more modernmovements as well, such as quantum physics, philosophical structuralism /relativism,the \"Discordian movement,\" hippie and rock culture, and the science-fiction scene.So have I utterly confused you now? After first taking up the cudgels for syncretism,which often undertakes an attempt to observe everything from a \"holistic\" point ofview, I have now reduced the whole thing to its component parts. By doing so, I onlywanted to make it clear that when syncretism propagates such a simplistic, uniformview of things, then (in my opinion) it can only lead to undesired dead ends at best. Butif its attack on the various, heterogeneous systems is a conscious one, this is whatactually gives it a practical driving force.But whoever wants to tritely interpret this as the \"unity of all things\" is confusingsomething here.

Even the Chymical Wedding of Christian Rosencreutz, which is stilltoday a core piece of literature within the Rosicrucian movement, was written instorytelling prose-and is often viewed by some naive individuals as a true, factualaccount. The list of such works and their authors is long, and I only want to pick out afew specific ones here to support my statements, not to make a doctoral thesis out of thesubject.We have British Rosicrucian and magician Bulwer-Lytton and his novel Zanoni, orthe Faust drama by Freemason Goethe, the novel Dhoula Bel from American sexmagician Paschal Beverly Randolph, the theatrical play Axel by Villiers de L'Isle-Adam, or the various works by Gustav Meyrink, ranging from The Golem to The GreenFace to The Angel of the West Window-these are all books of occult and often magicalcontent (which is not always the same) that were written by more or less expertauthorities of the material. We also need to mention Aleister Crowley's Moonchild, TheSea Priestess by Dion Fortune, and Gerald Brosseau Gardner, of course, with his HighMagic's Aid-a book that led to the birth of the whole new Pagan / Wicca movement.Finally, maybe I should mention the sex magic novel Exorial, written by the founder ofthe Fraternitas Saturni, Gregor A. Gregorius, who claimed that the original manuscriptfor this book was \"misappropriated\" by no one less than the head of the Swiss O.T.O.,Joseph Metzger. Some magicians may want to mention Initiation by Elisabeth Haich, aswell as The Red Lion by Maria Szepes. But then that should be enough.As you see, there are a number of examples for magical \"insiders\" who have triedtheir hand at literature.

Again and again, people claim that hisbook The Magic Mountain is a \"hermetic story\"-which may even be indirectly true.

Butthat goes for all of the characters: the archaic fight between good and evil, themes suchas betrayal and loyalty, stupidity and cleverness-all these and more can be found in anoverabundant number of fairy tales and, of course, in their predecessors: myths andlegends.Then add a story of personal development; a few elements swiped from the booksfor young people written by Lewis Carroll, Enid Blyton, Astrid Lindgren, and the like;not to forget of course the stories of the Wizard of Oz-and poof! The never-ending storyis complete! The use of a few magic spells and curses here and there, or standardmagical utensils such as magic wands and robes, certainly does not require soundknowledge of the magic scene, and has about as much to do with it as the specialtymagazines for stage magicians and illusionists. Anyone with a brain can make thesekinds of things up with a minimum of research.It may be difficult for the literary novice to comprehend how the literary or poeticcraft is actually practiced. Since I have no intention of subjecting you to an essay hereon creative writing, let it be sufficient to say that authors quite often fall back on olderreference material before shaping and wording something in their own way in"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"accordance with their personal writing style and the value system of their era. Let's justexamine three of the books mentioned above more closely: there was plenty of olderreference ma terial for Goethe's Faust; Preussler retells an ancient legend in Krabat; andPiers Anthony falls back on various myths and fairy tales to give his novels theappropriate plot elements and the necessary magical touch. Principally, you are right: itreally cannot just be made up. It requires a certain amount of literary skill but no morethan that.Do not get me wrong, dear Juliane-this doesn't mean that we still cannot enjoy theHarry Potter books. Or that we should have to feel guilty for doing so.Personally, I have never really had any interest in British boarding-school novels(and that is basically what these books are), but, while their mother was busy brewingup magic potions under strict observance of the phases of the moon and the planetaryhours, I did have the honor of reading the Potter books aloud to my cheeky littlenephews. A good way to expand one's knowledge, by the way. In any case, they bothhighly enjoyed the books, and I would not want to hold that against anyone. But please-do not mistake them for real magic!In piteous supplication,Your Aunt KlaraTo Write to the AuthorIf you wish to contact the author or would like more information about this book, pleasewrite to the author in care of Llewellyn Worldwide and we will forward your request.Both the author and publisher appreciate hearing from you and learning of yourenjoyment of this book and how it has helped you.
