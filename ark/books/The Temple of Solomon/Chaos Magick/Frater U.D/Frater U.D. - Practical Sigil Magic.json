For the most part, it can be performed without complicated rituals, needs hardly any paraphernalia, is independent of philosophical and dogmatic premises and, due to its simplicity, can be learned easily and quickly. Most important of all, none of the magical techniques we know of today is more efficient and will give even beginners the immediate chance to convince themselves of its power and their own abilities. These reasons alone support a volume like the following to show the possibilities of this discipline and to explain its techniques and its rationale. The reader—the complete tyro and the advanced practitioner alike—will receive an introduction which will accompany him/her in his/her magical practice for a long time to come. You will find in this edition in the following chapter a reprint of my article “Austin Osman Spare and His Theory of Sigils'' from the, alas, now—defunct German magazine Unicorn, issue 1/82. This issue has been out of print for quite some time, but many readers' inquiries have shown that there is still much interest in this article and it is increasing every day. Since the article also covers some of the historical and philosophical background of Spare's sigil magic, it might be useful to present it here within a new context to a greater audience. ix"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"x / Practical Sigil Magic The word method explained in the article will be shown in greater depth in chapter 2. Further examples will be given, as well as comments and tips for practical use which you will rarely find in literature on this subject. Next we will deal with the pictorial method, which has several advantages and disadvantages when compared to the word method. Again, in accordance with the title of this volume, magical practice will be of primary importance. A description of the mantrical spell method will complete the techniques of sigil construction proper. It is my hope that examples and commentaries from my personal practice will provide you with many new suggestions. Although Spare's mysterious Alphabet of Desire belongs, technically speaking, to the pictorial method and in some respects touches the word method, it may nevertheless be considered the center of his magical achievement. Unfortunately, his own comments about it are rather poor. Therefore, most writers, being familiar with the subject on a theoretical level only, have caused much confusion rather than clarity when discussing it. Yet, it seems to me that the basic principle of this magical symbol language is amazingly simple if viewed in relation to Spare's system as a whole. The chapter “The Alphabet of Desire,'' therefore, will not only offer a cursory comment on fragments from Spare's rather chaotic legacy but introduce a mature system of symbol—logic, accessible to everyone. This certainly would have been Spare's intent had he ever finished what has become known as the legendary Grimoire of Zos, i.e., had he"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Introduction / xi completed it with explanatory comments for the magicians of his time. Albeit Spare's personal philosophy (which he himself termed the Zos Kia Cultus) is not that important for sigil magic itself, we should not fail to mention his technique of Atavistic nostalgia, which is certainly one of the most fascinating applications of sigil magic. Furthermore, it marks its connection to Shamanism and so—called “primitive magic,'' two disciplines from which today's magicians can only profit. The main topic of the last chapter will concern planetary sigils from the Hermetic Tradition. Although experts have been familiar with the method of their construction for decades, little or no relevant literature has as yet been made available to a wider public. It, therefore, seemed pertinent to treat this subject matter here. The reader will note that in this volume we concentrate on creating personal, that is to say, individual sigils. This is a completely different approach compared to the tendency of many other books, which usually prefer to list traditional, largely mutilated or inaccurately reproduced sigils taken from the “magical cookbooks'' of generally obscure authors with little or no practical experience of their own. Although the planetary sigils"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"Xii / Practical Sigil Magic discussed at the end of this study are taken from the work of Agrippa Nettesheim, who is above all criticism in this respect, a single glance at other standard works about magical symbols will show that most magicians and alchemists in the Middle Ages (the supposed “peak” of Occidental magic) largely developed their own sigil language using a rather small number of well—established symbols. The myth that there is a small number of “correct” sigils and a great variety of “wrong” ones for entities (generally demons), whose names are often little else but mutilations of misunderstood older terms,1 has confused the minds of even highly experienced old hands. Such misinformation should no longer be tolerated. Of course, even “wrong'' dogmas can develop their own, definitely real, magical egregore in the course of time. But we should no longer be interested in struggling with the astral garbage which others have been creating for centuries. Spare has certainly opened—probably without an expressed intention to do so—our eyes to an atavism different from the one discussed in chapter 6, for he has shown us the origin of all magical symbolism—the human soul itself! His message is that those magical sigils which truly work derive from our own unconscious and will return again to their source to begin their work after being impregnated by our will. Naturally, and this applies to all magic, one might gain the false impression that it would be much less of a strain to get everything organized and prepared straight from the horse's mouth of a “Great Illuminated True Master of Wisdom,'' but this has nothing to do whatsoever with practical magical success. One could compare this to studying at a"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"Introduction / xiii university: anything you may have missed in the beginning through idleness will have to be made up for in the end with triple effort. But, you usually don't have enough time to catch up.... Spare states that “sigils are monograms of thought'' and that they should be created in accordance with the individuality of our thinking. So please, view the examples given in this study for what they are—examples only. Don't use them lazily and heedlessly. This could definitely be dangerous! At the beginning you will need perhaps a quarter of an hour or so for your first individual sigil, but by your fifth or sixth sigil it will take you only a couple of minutes. This effort will certainly prove to be worthwhile if you consider the probable success. As I said before, sigil magic is probably one of those magical disciplines that may be the fastest and easiest to learn. Usually, you will need nothing more than a sheet of paper and a pen. With some experience, you will have finished the whole operation, including activation and subsequent banishing, within less than five to ten minutes. There is no faster way—even in magic!"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"Chapter 1 Austin Osman Spare and His Theory of Sigils* The end of the nineteenth and the beginning of the twentieth century was a time characterised by radical changes and great heretics. The secret lore and the occult in general were triumphant, and there were good reasons for this: the triumph of materialist positivism with its Manchester industrialism was beginning to show its first malice, resulting in social and psychological uprooting; the destruction of nature had already begun to bear its first poisonous fruits. In brief, it was a time when it seemed appropriate to question the belief in technology and the omnipotence of the celebrated natural sciences. Particularly intellectuals, artists and the so-called “Bohemians” became advocates of values critical of civilisation in general as can be seen in the literature of Naturalism, in Expressionist Art and in the whole Decadent Movement, which was quite notorious at the time. ____________ *Reprint from Unicorn, Issue 1/82, pp. 34-38. 1"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"2 / Practical Sigil Magic Austin Osman Spare (1886-1956) was a typical child of this era and, after Aleister Crowley, he was definitely one of the most interesting occultists and practicing magicians of the English-speaking world. Nowadays he is basically known only in this cultural context;1 internationally, he has received only some attention in literary circles at best—ironically, in a footnote! This footnote is found in Mario Praz's pioneering but, unfortunately, rather superficial work La carne, la morte e il diavolo della letteratura romantica (The Romantic Agony, Florence, 1930) where he terms him, together with Aleister Crowley, a “satanic occultist”2—and that is all. Nevertheless, this important work has at least led many an occult researcher familiar with literature to Spare. Compared with Aleister Crowley's enigmatic and infamous life, Austin Osman Spare's existence certainly seemed to befit only a footnote. Despite his various publications after the turn of the century, he remained practically unnoticed until the late sixties. He was born in 1886, the son of a London police officer, and we know very little about his childhood. He claimed to have experienced while a child an initiation of sorts by an elderly witch, one Mrs. Paterson who, as far as we know, must have been quite a Wiccan-like character. Spare found his intellectual and creative vocation as an artist and illustrator, and he attended the Royal College of Art where he soon was celebrated as a forthcoming young artist. But he rebelled against a bourgeois middle-class career in the arts. Disgusted by commercialism, he retreated from the artistic scene soon afterwards, though he still continued editing various magazines for quite a while."},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"Austin Osman Spare and His Theory of Sigils / 3 From 1927 until his death, he virtually lived as a weird hermit in a London slum, where he sometimes held exhibitions in a local pub. People have compared his life with that of H. P. Lovecraft and certainly he too was an explorer of the dark levels of the soul. Around the beginning of the First World War, he released some privately published editions, and today one can acquire—at least in Great Britain—numerous, usually highly expensive reprints of his works. However, we are primarily interested in two volumes, namely his well-known Book of Pleasure (Se1f-Love): The Psychology of Ecstasy (London, 1913)3and Kenneth Grant's excellently researched book4 in which he, as leader of his own brand of O.T.O. (Ordo Templi Orientis) and as an expert on Crowley, deals with the practical aspects of Spare's system as well, Spare's actual philosophy will not be analyzed in depth here because this is not really necessary for the practice of sigil theory and it would lead away from the subject of this study. Before we begin with Spare's theory of sigils, it is perhaps useful to write a few words about the part sigils play in a magical working. Occidental magic is known to rest on two main pillars, namely on will and on imagination. Connected with these are analogous thinking and symbolic images. For example, Agrippa uses a special sigil for each of the planetary intelligences. These are not, as has been assumed for quite some time, arbitrarily constructed, nor were they received by “revelation,” but rather they are based on cabbalistic considerations.5"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"4 / Practical Sigil Magic The Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn also employed sigils as “images of the souls'' of magical entities, which enabled the magician to establish contact with them; nonetheless, the technique of their construction was not explained. The same may be said for O.T.O. under Crowley's leadership and for the Fraternitas Saturni under Gregorius. The name Agrippa already hints at the fact that magical sigils have a long historical tradition, which we will not discuss here because then we would have to cover the whole complex of occult iconology as well. In general, people think of ''correct'' and “incorrect” sigils. The grimoires of the late Middle Ages were often little else but “magical recipe books'' (the frequently criticized Sixth and seventh Books of Moses basically applies the same procedure of ''select ingredients, pour in and stir”), and these practitioners believed in the following principle: to know the “true'' name and the ''true'' sigil of a demon means to have power over it. Pragmatic Magic, which developed in the Anglo-Saxon realms, completely tidied up this concept.6 Often Crowley's revolt in the Golden Dawn—at first in favor of but soon against Mathers—is seen as the actual beginning of modern magic. It would certainly not be wrong to say that Crowley himself was an important supporter of Pragmatic thought in modern magic. But in the end, the Master Therion preferred to remain within the hierarchical Dogmatic system due to his Aiwass-revelation in Liber Al vel Legis. His key phrase “Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law. Love is the law, love under wil1,'' as well as his whole Thelemic concept, prove him a Dogmatic magician. "},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"Austin Osman Spare and His Theory of Sigils / 5 Not so Austin Osman Spare. He seems to derive from the individual-anarchistic direction so that we may describe his philosophy, without undue exaggeration, as a mixture of Lao-Tse, Wicca and Max Stirner. English magic of the turn of the century was also influenced by an important young science which would actually achieve its major triumphs only after the Second World War—the psychology of Sigmund Freud. Before that. Blatvatsky's Isis Unveiled and The Secret Doctrine, as well as Frazer's The Golden Bough, had given important impulses to the occult in general. William James's comparative psychology of religion influenced deeply the intellectuality of this time, but Freud, Adler, and especially Carl G, Jung eventually effected major breakthroughs. From then on, people started to consider the unconscious in earnest. This apparent digression, which had to be kept very short due to lack of space, is in reality a very important basis for the discussion that follows. We will not analyze in depth by whom Spare was influenced. Lao-Tse and Stirner having already been mentioned, we might note numerous others from Swinburne to Crowley himself, in whose order, the A.'.A.'., Spare had been a member at least for a short while. Rather, we will discuss his greatest achievement—his psychological approach towards magic. This leads us to magical practice proper. In Spare's system there are no ''correct'' or “incorrect” sigils; neither is there a list of ready-made symbols. It is of no"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"6 / Practical Sigil Magic import whether a sigil is the “correct” one or not, but it is crucial that it has been created by the magician and is therefore meaningful to him/her. Because s/he has constructed it for personal use, the sigil easily becomes a catalyst of his/her magical desire, and sometimes it will even waken this desire in the first place. This Pragmatic approach which dominates present-day Anglo-Saxon magic (Israel Regardie, Francis King, David Stephen Skinner, W, B. Gray, Conway, Lemuel Johnstone, to name but a few relevant authors) goes to show that Austin Osman Spare, rather than Aleister Crowley, should be considered the real Father of modern Pragmatic Magic.7 In the German-speaking countries, the situation is quite different. Writers like Quintscher, Gregorius, Bardon, Klingsor and even Spiesberger allow but little room to maneuver when creating magical coordinates individually. Here the adept is expectedly grow into a ready-made system instead of fashioning one, This is a completely different approach, the value or non-value of which we will not discuss here. The nearest thing to Pragmatic Magic, existing already in 1917 i.e. 1921 (the date of the second revised edition of his major work on magic as an experimental science), was Staudenmaier. The works by Mahamudra, which have of late been receiving some attention, are mainly of a descriptive nature and deal with traditions and new interpretations, thus remaining within the context of German magical heritage; however, they do take heed of recent results in scientific psychology and are, therefore, at least partially related to the Pragmatic approach. Pragmatic Magic will become more and more important because today's magicians have to face a"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"Austin Osman Spare and His Theory of Sigils / 7 Psychologized — and psychologizing — environment whose philosophical relativism has been shaping all of us, and still does. Regardless of the significance or amount of truth one concedes to psychology/psychoanalysis, we all are infiltrated by its way of thinking and its vocabulary. So even we magicians will have to attain to a critical, sensible look at it. It will be left to another era to find different models of explanation, description and practice. How does Spare proceed in practice? Sigils are developed by fusion and stylization of letters (see Figure 1). First of all, a sentence of desire has to be formulated. Let us take the example Spare himself gives in his Book of Pleasure, the declaration of intent: THIS MY WISH TO OBTAIN THE STRENGTH OF A TIGER This sentence must be written down in capitals. Next, all the letters which appear more than once are deleted so that only one of each letter remains. THIS MY WISH TO OBTAIN THE STRENGTH OF A TIGER Thus the following letters remain: T, H, I, S, M, Y, W, O, B, A, N, E, R, G, F. The sigil is created from these letters; it is permissible to consider one part (for example, M) as a reversed W or, seen from the side, as an E. Hence, these three letters do not have to appear in the sigil three separate times. Of course, there are numerous possibilities of representation and stylization."},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"8 / Practical Sigil Magic “This my wish to obtain the strength of a tiger.” Sigilized this would be: This is my wish To obtain The strength of a tiger Combined as one sigil or Figure 1"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"Austin Osman Spare and His Theory of Sigils / 9 However, it is important that in the end the sigil is as simple as possible with the various letters recognizable (even with slight difficulty). The artistic quality of the sigil is irrelevant, but for simple psychological reasons it should be obvious that you should not just scribble or doodle it in haste. You should strive to make it to the best of your abilities. The finished sigil, which in the beginning will probably take a few attempts to construe, will then be fixated. You may draw it on parchment, on paper, in the sand, or even on a wall. According to Spare’s short instructions, it should be destroyed after its internalization. Thus, you will either burn the parchment; wipe it out in the sand, etc. Spare’s basic idea is that the sigil, together with its meaning, must be planted into the unconscious. Afterwards, the consciousness has to forget it so that the unconscious can obey its encoded direction without hindrance. Formulating the sentence of desire8 and drawing the sigil should be done with the utmost concentration. It makes the following activation (“charging”) much easier. When the sigil is ready, it is activated by implanting it into the psyche. This is the most difficult part in this process, and Spare offers only very few hints on practical procedures. However, it is crucial that the sigil is internalized in a trance of sorts. This may take place in a state of euphoria (for example, by means of drugs), in ecstasy (for example, sex magically by masturbation, sexual intercourse or a ritual), or in a state of physical fatigue. For the latter example, eyes and arms may be tired by the magician folding his/her arms behind the head while standing in front of a mirror and staring fixedly at his/her image. The important thing is that it"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"10 / Practical Sigil Magic should click, meaning that the sigil must be internalized spasmodically, which, of course, requires some exercise and control. This procedure may be supported by repeating the sentence of desire rhythmically and monotonously like a mantra, becoming faster and faster; in doing so, one must stare fixedly at the sigil. (In our example of looking into the mirror [a magical mirror may be used, too], it is useful to draw the sigil onto the mirror with water-soluble paint.) After spasmodical internalization, the symbol must be destroyed and deleted from the conscious mind. As mentioned before, from now on it will be the unconscious which has to do the work. In my own practical work I have discovered that it may even be useful to keep the sigil on you, such as wearing a ring engraved with it, etc. But this will depend upon the magician’s individual predilection, and everybody should find his/her own way. Occasionally, it may prove necessary to repeat the whole procedure, especially if the goal is a very problematical one, requiring an outstanding amount of energy. Nevertheless, experience shows that it is of prime importance not to bring back the meaning and aim of the sigil into consciousness at any time. We are, after all, dealing with a technique akin to autosuggestion; thus, the rules are the same as with autosuggestions themselves. Therefore, you may not use negative formulas such as “THIS MY WISH NOT TO...” because very often the unconscious tends neither to recognize nor understand this “not,” and you might end up getting the opposite result than that which you originally desired. If you see a sigil every day, perhaps on a wall or engraved on the outer side of a ring, this should only take place unconsciously, just as one"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"Austin Osman Spare and His Theory of Sigils / 9 might not consciously notice an object which is in use all the time. Of course, you should keep your operation secret, for discussing it with skeptics or even good friends may dissolve the sigil’s power. The advantages of this method, of which only a short summary can be given here, are obvious4 It is temptingly easy, and with only a little practice it may be performed at any time and at any place It does not call for any costly paraphernalia; protective Circles and Pentagram rituals are not required (though sometimes they may prove useful, especially with operations of magical protection), etc. People who tend to psychic instability should, however, be cautious. Although the threshold to schizophrenia is not as easily crossed with this method as with common evocations, it does involve cutting deeply into the ecology of the psyche, an act which should be considered carefully in any case. The psycho-magical consequences are sometimes quite incalculable. As is well known, the real problem with magic is not so much the question whether it works, but rather the fact that it does. Used with responsibility, this method offers the magician a tool which provides him/her with a limitless variety of possible magical applications. Ubique Daemon ...

Also, Spare’s sigil magic has seen some further evolution during recent years, especially by English Chaos magicians as manifested in the various publications of the IOT order (IOT today = The Magical Pact of the illuminates of Thanateros). Thus, ever-growing divergences from Spare’s own methods and intentions have become quite common. To illustrate the word method (i.e., the construction of sigils employing the letters and words of a sentence of desire), Figure 1 of the preceding chapter gives some examples. The whole procedure occurs as follows: 1. The sentence of desire must be formulated and written down in capital letters. 15"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"16 / Practical Sigil Magic 2.

But artistic talent is no criterion for the success of sigil magic! THE MOST IMPORTANT POINT IS THAT YOU CREATE THE SIGILS FOR YOURSELF. Our glyphs may even look a bit “ugly,” “primitive,” “rough-hewn” or “handmade,” and sometimes this may even be an added bonus. Because of their “unrefined” image, they will appear to our unconscious (which will have to struggle with them) much more “magical” or maybe just “less ordinary.” In other words, a so-called “ugly” sigil differs a lot from our standardized and smoothed-up everyday environment of glossy machines and industrial pseudo-aesthetics.

If you prefer putting a lot of effort into a sigil, wishing to create a “real piece of artwork,” you are, of course, perfectly free to do so. It is recommended, however, for reasons to be discussed at greater length later, that you should not spend too much time consciously creating a sigil. This is because, among other arguments, it will be much more difficult to forget the sigil’s outline and contents or to push it out of the consciousness, which is so essential for its proper working. Before we start our discussion of the techniques for activating sigils, I would like to give you a few more practical tips. The first recommendation involves the method of constructing a sentence of desire. Sigil magic is primarily success magic. It aims at achieving very tangible and verifiable results. Accordingly, sentences of will should be concrete and specific. Ambiguity will confuse the unconscious and may lead to only partial Success at best,"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"20 / Practical Sigil Magic ll is advantageous since the injunction given BECOME ILL,” but say “THIS MY WISH TO REMAIN HEALTHY.” ans and amulets is commonly defined in that t experience has shown, as mentioned in chapter 1, that it is advisable to begin each sentence of desire with the same formula; in our example it was “THIS MY WISH...” One might also simply say “I WISH...” or “IT IS MY WILL...” or something similar. Specifically mentioning the wito the unconscious is clearer and easier to understand. Feeble phrasings such as “I WOULD LIKE TO...,” “I WOULD WISH TO...” or “I SHOULD WANT TO...” lack conviction and should be avoided. In the end, you will always have to learn from your own experiences and find your own optimal formula. We know from various other systems of manipulation of consciousness that negative formulas are usually not properly comprehended by the unconscious. While the unconscious is capable of understanding the metaphorical language (and sigils constructed with the word method are really nothing else) in expressions like “eradicate,” “remove” or “avoid,” it does seem to ignore words like “not,” “none,” “never,” etc., for most people. Therefore, do not say “THIS MY WISH NOT TO Interestingly enough, this does not apply to all areas of practical magic. For example, the difference between talismalismans are for something while amulets are against something. Thus, a talisman may be constructed for health; however, an amulet would be constructed against illness. But even with amulets one will usually restrain from using negative formulations (e.g., “PROTECT ME FROM ALL ILLNESS,” or something similar)."},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"Further Exploration of the Word Method / 21 hy and overly specific formulations. Later on, when we look at the theories which purport to explain how sigil magic works, we will realize that this mechanism has less to do with negative wording than with the general problem of how to get around the “psychic censor.” The experiences of some magicians who have achieved success with negative formulas have confirmed this point of view. But this is an exception to the rule, and you should try to avoid any risk, especially when starting with your practical work. The question as to whether one should formulate precisely or a bit “hazily” is arguable. In my experience, it is not sensible to dictate overly detailed directives to the unconscious. Sentences like “THIS MY WISH TO MEET FRANZ BARDON ON THE 17TH OF OCTOBER AT 3:32 P.M. IN SHARKY’S BAR” not only make great demands on your own Magis (or, as Indian shamans would label it, on your “control of the nagual”) but also presuppose a rather generous, good willed unconscious.

Before beginning our discussion of sigil activation, we shall take a closer look at how to simplify them. Overly complicated sigils are as ineffective as baroque tapeworm sentences of desire.

Second, it gives the sigil a “definite” and “conclusive” touch, for if you work a lot with sigils, occasionally you may find the sigils becoming “entangled” in your unconscious to form undesirable chains and combinations However, this happens very rarely, and the risk is comparatively small. It also happens mainly to sigil fanatics who don’t do anything else all day long but inoculate their unconscious, cramming it full with glyphs.

Let us look at a new example.

THE PROCESS OF SIGIL CONSTRUCTION ITSELF IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN ITS GRAPHIC RESULT! Of course, we do need the finished sigil, i.e., the graphic end result, for otherwise we could not charge or activate it. But it would be of no use to you at all if you had not constructed it alone, without any outside help.

Whereas Pete Carroll in Liber Null (p. 31), following on from other writers, basically sees it as a method of “holding one’s breath in an uncomfortable position until one nearly dies,”: Kenneth Grant4 regards it as belonging to sex magic. He sees the death posture (referring to Spare himself) as a technique whereby the conscious mind is switched off (that is to say, “intermediately slain”) by sexual activity, which means that all conscious thoughts will cease. Anyway, the crucial point, as with most magical trances, is that you can achieve a state of non-thinking or no-mind this way, whereby the conscious mind collapses for a short span of time (sometimes, as with an orgasm, only for seconds) and leaves free a direct channel to the unconscious. In the following text, two non-sexual variants of the death posture, which have proved themselves well in practice, particularly for people who are new to magic and who have little or no training in magical trances, are described."},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"The Magical Trance / Activating the Sigils / 33 longer.

For your first attempts, I recommend sitting before a table on which you have placed the sigil. After a deep breath, block your eyes, ears, mouth and nose, using the fingers of both hands.

Afterwards, as already mentioned, you banish by laughter and by concentrating on something completely different, the more secular the better. One version of this technique has already been described in chapter 1. It is performed by standing in front of a mirror on which you have drawn your sigil with water-soluble colors. Here again, physical over-exertion is employed. Stare into the eyes of your mirror image without fluttering your eyelids, then cross your arms behind your head or your neck, push your arms backwards as far and uncomfortably as you can, and tense all your muscles while holding your breath (you may also stand on tiptoes) Keep this posture until you cannot bear the tension and/or pain anymore.

As with talismans, amulets and magical rituals in general, the intent to forget a desire or magical operation is one of the greatest tasks for a magician if s/he wants to experience success quickly. Experience with meditation and thought control will certainly pay off now. You may have heard the story of the man who came to his guru and asked him what to do to become enlightened. “Nothing,” the guru answered “Just go on living as you did before. Oh, yes, there is one thing, though: avoid thinking of the monkey.” Very pleased, the man thanked his guru and returned home. But while on his way home, his thoughts began circling remorselessly: “I must not think of the monkey, I must not think of the monkey...”5 Why forgetting a sigil is of such primt too much of a problem, unless the glyph’s design is too simple. (To forget a square or triangle could prove rather difficult.) Forget the contents of the sigil and the sentence of desire.

As with the formulation of the sentence of desire, you will have to find a compromise between permanent memory and complete loss of any documentation. As to awaiting the success of the operation, don’t do it! This is also the best way of making sure that you will forget about it. If this is too extreme for you and if you have problems with forgetting, try to counter this hat state of consciousness which Spare termed the “Neither/Neither.” Ray Sherwin tags it “Nonattachment/Non-disinterest,” or, more precisely, “positive Non-desire.”6 This again is more a question of practice and self-discipline than of technique. There is yet one other technique for forgetting a sigil, namely getting used to it until you no longer perceive it consciously. You may be familiar with this principle from personal experience. You decide to do something special every day and, therefore, you hang a note in a prominent place as a reminder.

If you are a traditionalist-purist and want to use virgin parchment, you may do so, of course, but normal paper is quite good enough.7 After activation, sigils are usually burned or otherwise destroyed, but you can also make talismans and amulets out of them. In this case, you will want to use more durable materials. One way of doing this is by drawing the sigil on a piece of parchment or sturdy paper. If you charge it sex magically, you may put some sexual secretionliva) on it for support after activation. After banishing, you can roll up the paper or parchment and wrap some yarn or silk thread around it. Depending upon which school of “isolation techniques” you belong to, you may either seal this roll with pure beeswax or sew it into a piece of silk, linen or leather, etc. If you want to wear the amulet or talisman, it is advisable to make it into a necklace or tie it to a thong.

It is also one of the more complicated and less explored areas, not the least reason for this being the desolate situation of literary sources. Spare’s writings per se are very ambiguous and difficult to follow, and his exposition of the Alphabet of Desire is no exception. Even concerning his original comments we can only rely on Kenneth Grant,8 who seems intent on concealing more than he wants to divulge. Apparently, Spare conceived the Alphabet of Desire as a system of 22 glyphs, all of them expressing, to use his own words, “aspects of sexuality.” In none of his writings published to date do we find all of these “letters” fully listed, let alone explained. Nevertheless, we do have a number of clues as to what Spare meant by them. In general, Grant seems to stick quite strictly to the original and gives us many enlightening insights.

The following explanations should, therefore, be understood as my own, personal interpretations. The approach described hereafter has proved to be effective enough in my practical work, and we can find similar methods in other systems as well,11 but we must admit that we are more or less breaking virgin soil here. The advantage of this approach is that it leaves enough room for personal exploration, which might especially appeal to the more experienced sigil magician.

Additionally, there are four categories as a mirror of the psyche created by chains of associations.

The Alphabet of Desire as a Structuring principle Pete Carroll has presented us, in his wellc and precise manner, with this model in Liber Null (pp. 76-87). Unfolding his system, he does not base it—as did Spare—on purely sexual functions. Strictly speaking, his system is more of an “Alphabet of Emotions.” These emotions he arranges as “complementary dualisms”: FRIGHT/ATTRACTION JOY/TERROR, GREED/AVERSION, etc. Not all of these complementary dualisms will seem convincing at first glance. For example, it may not be absolutely clear to everybody why ATROPHY/FRUSTRATION and RELEASE/DISSOLUTION should be seen as supplementary opposites, and even his scant explanations do not help us a lot. Incidentally, he does not stick strictly to Spare’s division of 22 either, so we are justified in viewing his system as being an original creation of his own, following the Spare tradition. Carroll’s matrix will not be explained in detail here, but rather we will use it as an illustration to demonstrate by this one example how anyone can create his/her own Alphabet of emotions in doublets: LUST/DESTRUCTION; DISSOLUTION/RELEASE; ATTACHMENT/LOA-THING; RAPTURE/ANGER; GREED/AVERSION; ATTRACTION/FRIGHT; JOY/TERROR; ATROPHY/"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"66 / Practical Sigil Magic which in his stem covers the so-called “somatic emotions,” namely But this is not the end to his system.

The first three are based on alchemical symbolism, describing “the three states of matter” of each emotion: the Mercurial ( ), the Sulphurous ( ), and the Earthy ( ) levels. The Mercurial form indicates states of over- stimulation and dissolution of consciousness followed by catharsis or ecstasy (p. 76). The Sulphurous form indicates “the normal functional mode of the emotion,” thus lying in between the Mercurial and Earthy mode, both of which derive from the first principle, comparable to the state of the “prima materia” in alchemy. The Earthy form is one of repression and unrealistic/unrealizable emotions. The other two meta-structures are based on the principles of SOLVE ET COAGple (separation, repulsion, avoidance) includes the terms DEATH, HATE, FEAR, PAIN and DEPRESSION. The COAGULA principle (attraction, coming together) comprises the terms SEX, LOVE, DESIRE, PLEASURE and ELATION.

Just listing them is not good enough, however. You will have to find a proper framework for them. Let us start with a modest example. For reasons of simplicity, we will experiment with the four elements EARTH, WATER, FIRE and AIR. This is a system with which most magicians will be at least somewhat familiar.

The four xamples of Figure 23 clarify this process. You will observe that we are taking the basic symbol and combining it with the letters of the term. Of course, these relationships are open to argument.

He does not use the word so much in the sense of “longing for something (the source),” although this may be included as well, but rather employs it to signify an act of conscious revitalization of old, archaic structures of the consciousness. Consequently, Spare tried to go back into early, pre-human stages of consciousness by activating genetic or hereditary memory. This, for him, was not an end in itself, for his basic premise was that our greatest magical power, probably even the source of magic itself, lies hidden in these early stages of evolution. This assumption is confirmed if we take a look at the practices of Siberian or South American shamans or various African fetish priests, e.g., work with power animals, animal clan totems, etc. Practice also confirms this over and over again. Only when the magical will (which Spare is fond of calling “belief”) has become “organic,” meaning unconscious and carnal, is it, according to Spare, most effective. The deeper we go into our magical trance, returning to earlier stages of consciousness, the easier it will be for us to partake of its magical power and, most important, to direct and use it.

Spare did not leave us any accurate directives on how to deal with Atavistic nostalgia, but his magical pictures and steles (to which he usually added handwritten explanations and reflections) give us some idea about his possible mode of approach. As is to be expected, he achieved these changes in consciousness by employing sigils. There are several methods of Atavistic nostalgia.

Despite all the dangers which are entangled with the use of specific or less specific animated atavisms, a small number of magicians will always consider this to be the crown of their art and one of their highest aspirations.

In this respect, the magic of the “re-animated atavisms” also represents a mystical and philosophical method, a method which chooses the path “directly through the flesh” instead of, as is regular Western practice, employing the spirit only, without appreciating the vessel which enables its existence in the first place. To complete the picture, it must be mentioned that sigil magic is not the only magical way.

Nevertheless, I urgently advise experimenting with the Alphabet of Desire in this field because here its abilities can be developed to the fullest and because its energy seems to be best adapted to this line of magic. Working with a structured alphabet provides us with the additional advantage that our experience may gain more stability and, in some cases, more substantiality On the other hand, an associatively constructed alphabet often provides us with very powerful instantly successful, sigils because its glyphs pop up even more “directly” from the unconscious and the hereditary memory than those of other techniques with the possible exception of the pictorial methods. It’s also true that these two different methods of constructing the alphabet may be combined with one another. Thus, we might, for example, (as did Spare) construct 22 basic glyphs (being the generic or basic terms) and then add any number of merely functional glyphs using the method of automatic association.

Regarding this “incarnation,” we must never forget that the sigils themselves play nothing but a secondary part in the overall process of magic. Spare even goes so far as to state that each evolutionary step has been an unconscious, literally “corporeal” act of will Thus, for example, animals only started to develop wings when their desire to fly had become “organic” This may seem a weird proposition, but basically it is nothing but a rephrasing of the old theory that all creation is based on an act of will of the godhead or of Chaos, or incarnated Will.

Neither Freud nor Jung went so far as many modem occultists tend to do—to confuse an explanatory model with a law of nature.

If we read Spare’s attempts at an explanation, we get the Impression of a near fanatic hostility against the consciousness.

Many a sigil magician has come to the conclusion that it is best to construct a multitude of sigils let them lie around for weeks or months, and activate/internalize them only when the contents (and the purpose for which they have been constructed) have been completely forgotten. This technique seems to be reasonable, but then, of course, it is suited only for long-term operations. Nevertheless, it cannot be denied that sigils are more effective in relation to how completely they have been obliterated from consciousness. Ray Sherwin has presented an explanatory model which is quite enticing.13 To explain the illustration it should be mentioned that Sherwin considers the Holy Guardian Angel (cf. the Abramelin system) as being the psychic censor (a somewhat unconventional interpretation which has its source in Chaos Magic). The term Kia is taken from Spare’s system and is explained by Sherwin’s description of point k. Now, a and b join to construct the sigil, which then has to be implanted in d . If d refuses to accept the sigil, it is probably because it does not understand it. The reason may be that it is either too complicated or that a and b use symbols, pictographs and ideograms which are not compatible with those of d. Sherwin points out that, according to Aleister Crowley, only a magician who is capable of direct communication with the HGA will achieve a direct connection to the unconscious.
