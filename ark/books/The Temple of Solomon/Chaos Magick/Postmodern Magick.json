Allattempts will be made however, to present within these pages a possible path ofself-discovery and initiation that will lead the determined seeker into an evolutionof knowledge, wisdom, and skill. Ultimately all magi must evolve alone, yet it ishoped that the following pages may serve to facilitate the treacherous first stepsdown this path.Within the reader will be first presented with a basic and introductory coursein post-modern magick. This presentation is designed to inform and prepare thebeginner in the study and applied practice of magick. Yet it is also such a rich andfull series of concepts, that a return to the fundamentals can be of great benefit toeven the most potent of adepts.The introductory section will be followed by a grimoire of post-modern spells.First is a list of various formulaic, spontaneous, and ritual spells, all appropriatelynamed and carefully explained. Also included is an intensive ceremonial spell,presented in classic dramatic form, and exists as a multi-purpose group working.By delving deeply into the multitude of spells presented, the discerning maguswill be able to glean the ways in which effective and powerful spells are created.Thus empowered, both the beginner and the adept will have at their disposal notonly this array of spells, but the knowledge and ability to create and implementtheir own.After the spells segment, will come several example post-modern texts. Theyare independent manuscripts in their own right, and completely self-containedparadigms. They have been included to serve two purposes. One is to illustratethe way in which an informed post-modern magus, in this case the author, is ableto create personal paradigms, each one valid within its own precepts, and changehis or her own belief systems at will. The second purpose is to present a model foraspiring magi to create paradigms and the accompanying spells of their own.The final section of the text is a collection of older magical texts from whichmuch modern magical traditions and practices derive. These texts provide notonly as a reference for modern elements, but also as a framework for the seeker’s"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Introduction3initial post-modern activities. By presenting some of the primary sources formodern magical practice, the neophyte and adept will not only be able to investi-gate their likely “roots”, but when combined with the previous experimental gri-moires, they will have an initial body of work from which to begin their careers aspost-modern magi."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"4Post-Modern MagickDefining Magick: (Magic is defined as the process of shaping reality to the will ofthe user of said magic. Whereas the word spell means the tangible result of suchuse of the will, magic is the process in which the spell is completed. One mightargue that science is a process that produces useable data, and therefore is magic.The one difference between magic and any other process, thus the one thingdefining it as magic, is the fact that it is an occult process. Everyone knows or hasthe ability to learn or discover normal or scientific processes, magic by its natureas an occult element of reality, is secret and difficult to learn or command. Forthe Initiated, meaning those who have delved into the occult realms of reality andhave learned those secrets, such a process is an option.)Post-modern magick is an eclectic and deconstructionist non-system of realityshaping. While there is no fundamental structure or form, an illusory and prag-matic construct must be presented in order to accomplish basic communicationin the literary medium. So it follows that this book itself is a work of postmod-ernism, and in no way should be seen as the singular valid vessel of knowledgewhere post-modern magick is concerned.This book is intended to serve as a primer, given that the essence of post-mod-ern magick is individual personal relevance. As such, there can be no authorita-tive text on post-modern magick, only presentations of the Crafts of individualpost-modern magi who hope to teach by example. This being said, post-modernmagick has a somewhat simple fundamental magical theory, and an essentiallyHermetic, or Western Mystic, approach to the study and use of magick. Thoughnot at all trapped by dogma or inflexibility in either aspect.Do not be mistaken, post-modern magi are very committed people, and donot suffer from the relativism that cripples many of the more eclectic practitio-ners in other traditions. While post-modern magick is based on the deconstruc-tion of existing systems, it is done will full knowledge of these systems and a deepseated drive to rediscover, invent, and evolve."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"5The General PerennialPrinciples of MagicIn nearly every culture of the world there is, or once was, a notion of what iswidely known today as magic. The words vary from culture to culture, but theyall have the same general meaning, so for the sake of clarity the word magic willbe used in all cases. Also, for the sake of time and clarity, the existence of magicwill not be questioned. It will be assumed, within the scope of this paper, thatmagic does exist and the issue will not be addressed further.From the past to the present magic has been a part of many, if not most, of thecultures of the world. Each culture has it’s own views as to the properties, uses,and ethics of magic. With so many cultural versions it can be very difficult to gaina real understanding of magic. This has led to much of the skepticism of magicthroughout the years. Since the ideas of magic are so varied throughout the worldit has been difficult if not impossible for many to accept the validity of both sci-ence and magic. Many people are of the opinion that if science were to be inte-grated with the idea of magic in its many current forms, that science would besomehow lowering itself. In order for there to be an integration of the two disci-plines all magic must be unified under one set of principles, much like science hasits foundations in the scientific method.In order to create this set of principles a perennial approach must be taken.Perennial philosophy is a way of thinking that takes into account one’s own exist-ence and experiences, but also those of all people past and present. It is a schoolof thought that attempts to find a commonality in human experience and under-standing. The perennial approach would search out common ideas and views ofmagic and put them together. In the perennial approach we try to find the com-monalties of magic throughout the world. With these commonalties we will beable to identify the core elements of magic. From those core elements the classicalprinciples of magic can be developed.While making the attempt to create such a set of principles it is important toinclude absolutely no cultural elements in the principles. There are persons whowould disagree with this; the argument being that culture is necessary and that"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"The General Perennial Principles of Magic6stripping it away is foolish and disrespectful. The removal of culture from the setof principles is necessary to provide science with an unbiased and objective coun-terpart. Once magic and science are made to coexist then the culture surroundingmagic can once again be considered because the basic principles that culture’smagic is working off of have been identified, thus satisfying the demands of sci-ence.There is an unfortunate lack of respect in the field of science towards the prac-tice and existence of magic, just as there is an equal amount of aversion towardsscience in the minds and hearts of many who follow magical paths. In our culturethe importance of science has been elevated above all other things, many times atthe expense of magic. Perhaps by taking up the practice of magic and enteringinto a dialogue with science these problems can be dealt with.What follows is the set of principles I was able to identify and develop throughmy own research into the various magical traditions of the world, both past andpresent.1.All energy is potential magical energy.2.Magic is the use of will to elicit change in energy towards a desired end.3.The ability to use magic is directly affected by belief.4.The power of magic depends upon the focus of the user.“All energy is potential magical energy.”—This is the principle that showshomogeneity of magical energy in all magical traditions of the world. Most cul-tures have a word that is a close approximation of magical energy. Some culturescall this energy “mana”, others call it “chi”, and some just call it “juice”. There aremany names for this magical energy that is believed by these cultures to permeatethe world, and is there for those who can access it. The fact that every magic-using culture has some idea of a magical energy shows a commonality. Physicsshows that all natural events involve a transformation of energy from one form toanother, but the amount of energy does not change in the transformation. Thelaw of conservation of energy shows us that matter and energy can neither be cre-ated nor destroyed. Albert Einstein showed that all matter is energy. If everythingin creation is energy in some form, including magical energy, and energy cannotbe created or destroyed, only transformed, then it can be said that all energy ispotential magical energy.“Magic is the use of will to elicit change in energy towards a desiredend.”—This is the principle that deals with the actual act of magic. Of the fourprinciples this is the one that is found in every culture almost without exception."},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"The General Perennial Principles of Magic7Many cultures see magic as an individual acting apart from society or religion inorder to achieve some personal goal, and when acting alone the only tool one hasis the will. The process of magic, the act of using one’s will to do magic, is mor-ally neutral. The moral implications of magic fall upon the shoulders of themagic-user, not the magic itself. Through the use of will changes are made inenergy, that, provided the will is strong enough, result in the desired outcome.Much like it takes will to sit in Buddhist meditation for hours on end, it takeswill to summon up magical energy and use it to cause changes in reality.“The ability to use magic is directly affected by belief.”—This principle ofmagic is the principle what illustrates the dynamic nature of magic. It can beinferred from this principle that if a person does not believe that they are capableof magic then they are not capable of doing so. One might argue that experienceslike the Kundalini awakening, a phenomenon entailing the abundant rising ofpotent spiritual energy from the base of the spine, happens regardless of belief inmagic. While Kundalini is a magical experience, the person experiencing theawakening is not at that moment willworking. The awakening does howevergreatly encourage the belief in such things as more energy openings occur in theperson, which eventually develop into the Kundalini powers, psychokinesis andtelepathy, which are in their most basic, non-cultural nature, magic. The abilityto use magic is not only the capability of magic, but also the style of the ability.The way in which one believes magic works greatly shapes one’s ability to use it.For instance, many Satanists believe that their powers come from studying textsand initiation rituals. Many of them even believe that their leaders and demonicallies grant powers to them. They also believe that such powers can be taken awayfrom them. Many practitioners of Vodoun also believe that their powers aregranted to them in some form by the loa. There are other magic-users whobelong to a group known as the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn whobelieve that magical ability is a measure of one’s will, and that the only limitingfactor the self. If one strips culture away from this principle it can be seen thatbelief shapes the ability to use magic, which is a commonality among most cul-tures.“The power of magic depends upon the focus of the user.”—This principle isperhaps the most broad of the four principles. This principle deals with severalelements of focus. One of the elements of focus is the ability of the magic-user togather various amounts magical energy and shape it into the desired form with-out losing control of the summoned energy. An example of this would be a Teu-tonic sorcerer attempting to write runescript upon the blade of a sword. Themore magical energy the sorcerer puts into the drawing of the runes, the more"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"The General Perennial Principles of Magic8powerful they will become. If the sorcerer tries to use more energy than he or shecan control and still cast the spell, then something undesirable might happen,such as the sword breaking or the spell simply not working. Many people believethat this is one of the many roles played by rituals. Aside from their social func-tions, rituals provide the magic-user with a specific way to go about using magic.Many psychologist and sociologist have showed that human beings like order. Tobe more specific, human beings like maps. The rituals serve as maps for themagic-users to keep in mind while they work their magic; it is a tool for deepen-ing one’s concentration and energy controlling capacity. Because of this manymagical traditions feel that ritual is a tool to be used until the magic-user is capa-ble of causing the same changes without the use of ritual, metaphorical trainingwheels in a way. For these traditions, the more internalized rituals become, theless one has need for them. The other element of focus is the perceived source ofthe magical energy being utilized by the magic-user. Many magic-users focus ondrawing the magical energy from within their own being, in essence they seethemselves as their own power source. Others focus on drawing their energy fromspecific deities. This is not to say that the above sort of focus applies to those peo-ple who coerce spirits for aid. This focus applies to the practitioners of theurgy.For theurgist, the magical energy that they use comes directly through the deitythat they are focusing upon. An example of this would be a Catholic priest per-forming an exorcism upon a possessed person, by invoking the power of God thepriest is able to shape that power and use his will to cast the demon out.Now that the principles have been shown and explained, one might wonderwhy one would practice magic in the first place. There are several reasons. Onereason is responsibility. Each person’s responsibilities are different; therefore, theywill need different ways of dealing with those responsibilities. Shamans, priests,police officers, and politicians perform their services to aid and protect their soci-eties. Parents are responsible to their families. Citizens are responsible to theirgovernments just as governments are responsible to their citizens. Magic, just likeany other skill or tool, can help a person to live up to their responsibilities. It is apotent addition to the versatility of individuals who have magic as one of theirabilities. In addition to being a very useful skill or tool, magic has a deeper ele-ment to its practice. Many of the magical traditions of the world see magic as away of deep exploration of the self and the universe. When someone enters intothe practice of magic that person comes into contact with very powerful forceswithin the universe that serve to deepen the magic-user’s perceptions. Much likethe UFOE experience discussed in many transpersonal psychology circles, theexposure to magic forces a widening of one’s sense of the universe. It shatters the"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"The General Perennial Principles of Magic9construct of a purely rational and empirical worldview, and forces the person tolive in a much wider, deeper, more cosmically aware state of being.There is, however, a common pitfall that many people may experience in rela-tion to the practice of magic. Magic is, as one can see from the four principles, apractice that can easily lead to the inflation of the ego of the magic-user. Grandi-osity and egocentrism can be very difficult problems that sometimes develop inthe lives of magic-users, both past and present. Some might begin to flaunt theirpowers before those without them. Others may interpret their powers as evidencethat they are some sort of important religious figure, the “One”. Many mightmake the mistake of placing will above all other things as what is best in people,this sentiment stemming from the use of will in magic of course. Sometimes themagic-user gets caught up in the power before the openings of perception occurand the deepening of the self becomes a reality. The struggle not to fall into ego-centrism and grandiosity is an ongoing one, so vigilance and openness mustalways be maintained.Now that you have finished this chapter, read it again. Commit to memoryand analysis until you find yourself questioning it, possibly even finding disagree-ment with it. It is this informed questioning that is the essence of post-modernmagick.Now you are ready."},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"10Free Form MagickIn order for there to be any religion, there must exist in the world fundamental-ists of that religion. They give it form, create its tenants, formulate the paradigm,and shape the worldview of that religion. There also exists in the world religiousand spiritual seekers and people who take a more eclectic approach to religion.They sample from several faiths, moving through them as if trying to find thebest fit. Though there are a great many of these eclectic seekers they would haveno material to work with were it not for fundamentalist and their creations.Without a group of people who have dedicated themselves to one path, perceivedby them as the only “true” path, the eclectic seeker would have no frame of refer-ence from which to begin and continue their journey.The absolute same principle exists in the realm of magick. There must be fun-damentalists who create systems of magick in order for there to be material forthe more eclectic, or Hermetic, magick users. The knowledge, wisdom, theoreti-cal, and functional advantages of such rigid systems as Wicca, Classical Thelema,and Goetia, are all examples of such fundamentalist systems. If one makes an in-depth study of most forms of magick, like ceremonial magick or chaos magick forinstance, one will discover a great many persons who believe that only their sys-tem (ceremonialists), or the rigid denial of a system (chaos mages), is of any useor importance. While the value and potency of these systems is undeniable, it isimportant for those of a more informed and eclectic way of being to not allowthemselves to be trapped by rigid magical systems or the denial thereof.Magick is a very vibrant and versatile art, one that cannot be contained,defined, or encompassed by one system alone. Also remember that even styles ofmagick, when viewed as the “only” or “superior” way, can lead to stagnation, ashutting out of the potential for growth. It is possible, if one chooses, to combineparadigms, such as the Wiccan earth oriented path and the Thelemic true will/ego path, and create an entirely new paradigm. Or one can switch back and forthas one sees fit. This can also be done with styles of magick.So long as one has studied, truly delved deeply into the various traditions, par-adigms, and styles of magick, a true and enlightened style of free form magick canbe transmuted from this patchwork collection of ideas and techniques. The pri-"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"Free Form Magick11mary key is that all elements of one’s tradition, paradigm, and style of magick isthat they are personally relevant. If one part of a ritual is relevant and another isnot, remove the irrelevant element and replace it with something better. Inessence, use what works for you, and do not worry so much about protocol,dogma, or tradition. Versatility is the very evolutionary essence of magick.The end result of an approach such as free form magick is that the studentbecomes the “Jack of all Trades and Master of None”. This is one of the twopaths of magick available to any neophyte or adept. The other path is that of themaster. The master is a magus who devotes his or herself completely to oneschool of thought, magical tradition, or any other singular and rigid pursuit. Intime that magus will become a most puissant practitioner of their chosen art,though will not have much in the way of flexibility or the ability to evolve beyondtheir own paradigm.The “Jack”, the post-modern magus, is the harbinger of magical evolution.This magus studies the workings and advancements of the masters, then uses thisknowledge interchangeably to forge ahead into new territory. Though neverbecoming a master of anything, the post-modern magus becomes competent ateverything, and thus always has the ability to overcome. This is truly the path ofthose predisposed towards innovation and research, instead of refinement and theprogression of traditional initiation.Post-modern free form magick is indeed the middle path, with Attitude."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"12Hermetic MagickThe Hermetic tradition has a long and prestigious history, one far too complexand exhaustive to detail in these few pages of a single book. There are quite liter-ally libraries full of texts and manuscripts from the Hermetic tradition. What willbe attempted here is a basic introduction to Hermeticism. It is important to havea working knowledge of the tradition that is most closely related to post-modernmagick, and is in many ways the precursor to the post-modern approach.The Hermetic tradition has is roots in the eclectic miasma of mythology, phi-losophy, theology, folklore, and magic that was synthesized by a great manyoccult writers and explorers throughout history. The original idea held by theseindividuals, at least the idea in a functional form, was that they would combine asmany of the above methods as possible into a useable system that breached thecultural boundaries in the search for a universal discipline.They postulated that if one could strip away much of the cultural dogma thatsurrounded the mystical teachings and hearth knowledge of the various tradi-tions, one could successfully combine all of these traditions into a single traditionthat was greater than just the sum of its parts. This led to a flourishing explor-atory occult community, combining all manner of magical practices in an experi-mental attempt to distill an essence of magick and the occult.The primary concern of the Hermetic tradition is to take from each system themost powerful and useful elements and arrange them cross-culturally in order tofind the commonalities and most efficient uses. Once these fundamentals can beidentified, then the Hermetic would be able to control the forces of reality with-out being bound by one culture, dogma, or system.For the Hermetic, magick can easily be divided into an infinity of forms, andnew techniques are developed and implemented often, so listing them would bean unending process. So for the sake of clarity and pedagogy, the ten basic formswill be listed, as well as five of the most fundamental techniques.These forms are very basic, though the details of the form can be made morespecific should one choose."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"Hermetic Magick13The forms are Animal (animals), Aquam (water), Auram (air), Corpus (body),Herbam (plants), Ignem (fire), Imaginem (image), Mentam (mind), Terram(earth), and Vim (power).The same precautionary statement should be made for the techniques in thatthese are the fundamentals, are more refined techniques can and have been cre-ated and used.The techniques are Creo (creation), Intellego (perception), Muto (transforma-tion), Perdo (destruction), and Rego (control).The Latin names are used both to provide an additional empowering depar-ture from the norm, and to make it easier to form ritually appropriate sentencesof form and technique. All Hermetically oriented spells can be classified withinthree types of magick.Formulaic magick is very structured. Formulaic spells are intricate combina-tions of invocations, gestures, and physical foci used to channel, define, andtightly focus the present magical forces. Though Formulaic spells often take along time to research, develop, and master, once integrated and committed tomemory they enable the magic user to control vast and puissant forces with rela-tive ease. Most Hermetic study is concerned with Formulaic Magick, and themajority of the available writings pertain to it.Spontaneous magick however, sacrifices power a precision for versatility andspeed. Instead of using the finely controlled rigors of a formulaic spell, the magicuser simply combines a few words or gestures that are appropriately significantwith magical energy summoned for the spell, and wills the effect to occur.Though easier and faster than any other magic, spontaneous magick is resultantlyless powerful and its effects temporary.Ritual magick, on the opposite end of the magical spectrum from spontane-ous, is the most powerful and most time consuming of the three types of magick.Rituals, in general, take a long time to perform, and as a source of potency usuallyrequire the caster to incorporate rare or difficult elements into the ritual. Exoticor expensive plant and animal material, archaic languages, forgotten symbols ornames, and all manner of challenging ceremonial verses and sympathetic foci areall part of ritual magick. Because of the preparation, performance challenges, andinherent specificity of rituals, they become the most precise and puissant of spellsavailable to a magus of any knowledge or ability.There are other, less fundamental types of magick. While they are not dis-cussed at length here, they are chiefly concerned with the summoning, channel-ing, benevolence, or evocation of external spiritual beings."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"14Magical WillMagick, as it is known to most, is more an act of will than any other event. It iscommonly agreed that it is through this force, this enlightened Will, that all mag-ick is given its fundamental potency. Though it is the energy that gives substanceto any working, it is the will of the magick user that shapes and wields the energy.It occurs to the author of this passage that the difference between magical willand personal will should be investigated and clearly defined.“Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law”–Aleister CrowleyTake the above statement, at face value the word is taken to mean the force ofpersonality, a desire, some facet of a person’s ego. Yet once the phrase is fully ana-lyzed, with the element of magick involved as Crowley intended, the meaningbecomes much less cut and dry. There is a difference between what is commonlyreferred to as will and what can aptly be aptly called the Magical Will.Will, as it is known and accepted, is the vehicle that transports the desires ofthe ego and personality. This can be taken to mean that a strong willed person issomeone who can forcefully manifest his or her desires into physical or social real-ity. This is not to say, however that a person equipped with a strong will is neces-sarily capable of great magical workings, or that a person with a weak personalwill cannot have a strong magical will. Quite possibly, a person with an abso-lutely weak magical will could possibly have a near indomitable and unshakeablepersonal will.The Magical Will is the force that one exerts in order to manipulate magicalenergy. It is used to both gather and shape those energies, as well as control andsend out those energies. Magical will is the raw strength of a magick user. It is aspiritual element of all humanity that allows t to touch, tap, and control magick.Therefore, if the magical will of a person is their raw power, the skill of a per-son determines how well the power can be used. The amount of learning, wis-dom, and knowledge gives the magus the ability to understand and perceive themotivations, causality, and consequence of magical workings. So it is that onemust not only have strength, but one must have knowledge and skill. It is withthe proper skills and sufficient knowledge that the adept is able to fully utilize the"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"Magical Will15magical will, whereas all others wain in weakness or misapplications of uncon-trolled power."},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"16The LogrisThe Logris, in a classical sense, is a dynamic symbol of Chaos. While keeping thisoriginal meaning as a reference the word Logris can also be used to describe thestaging area for spells within the “aura” of any magus, like a membrane of sortsthat surrounds the magus.While much argument and essay could be held in defining and investigatingthe aura itself, that will not be done here. Instead, the word aura will be definedloosely as the collection of energy fields that permeate and surround the magus.One of these energy fields is the Logris. For those who are aware of its existenceand skilled enough to use it, the Logris can serve as both a medium for the castingof spells and an amplifier for the power of the spell.The theory and procedure are as follows:Much like various parasites that graft themselves to the skin or aura of humansand magi alike, just so can a spell be attached, or “hung” on the Logris energyfield, almost like a temporary tattoo on the skin.The magus first casts the majority of the spell. Once the spell is complete, butnot sent, the spellcaster visualizes the Logris field. When the Logris has beenraised the spellcaster puts the spell onto the Logris. Perhaps visualizing physicallyhanging the spell on a wall, peg, or the shimmering surface of a forcefeild. Bydoing so the magic user will be able to effectively store up spells until they areneeded. At that point there are two things that can be done. The magic user,finding his or herself in need of quick and powerful magick, could pull one ofthese spells off the Logris.This acts as a power multiplier for the spell. First there is energy put into thespell itself, added to the power used to activate the stored spell and push it out ofthe Logris. Then there is the additional energy boost from the spell’s passagethrough the Logris itself. Thus making a most potent spell indeed. Effectivelyallowing the spells cast by that magus to have a potency much greater than thecaster himself.This technique also allows the caster to perform lengthy and complex ceremo-nial or formulaic magick, then store the spell to use at their leisure.

However, one must always remember that the lawsof thermodynamics also, at times, apply to magical energy. The amount of powerand thus number of spells that can effectively hang on the Logris depends greatlyupon the power and energy capacities of the magic user himself.Once a spell is hung on the Logris it begins to decay like an unused muscle ora leaking barrel of gunpowder. Depending upon how much power was put intothe original spell, it will take a small portion of that to maintain the spell’spotency over long periods of time. As a result most magic users who employ theLogris technique either hang several spells that they intend upon using soon, orthey store only a few potent ones and then hold onto until just the right moment.A final exciting benefit from using the Logris often is that the energy field isgradually effected by the spells hung upon it. So the observant, patient, and pow-erful magus could use this knowledge to cast the same spells often. Over time theLogris will begin to “remember” spells often hung upon it, and once the adeptbecomes the master the Logris will evolve from being merely a storehouse andamplifier, but also providing immediate access to a multitude of spells regularlycast though it.

It is a place where sight, sound, and feeling are perceived as“real” whilst the dreamer is inside. While the multiverse is considered by mostmagick users to be made up of an immeasurable number and variety, there areseveral places generally considered to be the realms most common to the experi-ence of a magus. These are the astral, the infernal, the dreamscape, the celestial,and the realm of faerie.The astral realm is the spiritual reflection of the physical realm. While muchof the realm is identical to the physical realm, the energy resonance of places istangible in the astral. The infernal realm is a distillation of the negativity andmore evil or demonic elements and denizens of reality, many others refer to thisrealm as the lower astral. The celestial is a realm of ideals, positive energy, and isthe repository for most of humanities higher spiritual aspirations. The realm offaerie is the patchwork world of folklore, myth, and fantasy. The realm of dreamsis less its own reality and more a staging area for entrance into one of the aboverealms.Some call the astral the spiritworld, others simply refer to it at the “otherplace”. To make the attempt to classify levels of existence that defy classificationwould be a waste of pages. Instead I will endeavor to equip the reader with theknowledge that will allow you to explore these elements of reality for yourself.One must believe, or at least be ready to believe. As an overabundance of skep-ticism will prevent the mage from leaving the body and entering the alternatereality. One must achieve an altered state of consciousness. The best method ofcourse is meditation or controlled breathing. By doing so the mage, through visu-alization, leaves the body and enters the astral. There are many techniques for thismost difficult of transitions, the most simple of which is meditation and visual-ization of stepping out of one’s body and being reborn into an alternate world.This skill is much more difficult than most other magicks due to its subjectivenature.

Sometimes they willbe real, other times they will be the products of an imaginative mind rushingtowards a delusion of success. It is important to remember that lucid dreaming isalso a viable method of gaining access to the astral.The best resources on astral magic and travel are the following two books:Arcane Lore–A text that focuses on gaining access to the astral via luciddreaming.The Magical Use of Thoughtforms: An experiential and academic combina-tion of the techniques and descriptions of the above two books, very easily theauthority on the subject."},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"LIBER II"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"21A Post-Modern GrimoireZen NavigationThis spell allows the caster who finds his or herself in a situation in which there isa need to follow someone, find a thing, or seek a place without the luxury of amap, area knowledge, or homing device. The caster first focuses her conscious-ness/awareness upon the target, be it a destination, object, or living quarry. Oncea firm connection has been established, the mage must “lock-on” to the target,never letting the attention waver. The caster becomes so focused upon the targetthat as she moves towards the target, be she on foot or in a vehicle, the usual dif-ficulties of travel will not hamper her. So long as she maintains this trance likestate she will be able to arrive at the target just as if she knew exactly where toturn, how far to go, and when to stop. To the unknowing bystander the casterwill appear lost, or at the very least to be simply wandering randomly, though inreality the mage is allowing both her inborn senses and her magical connectionwith the target to guide her through the unseen pathways that lead straight to thetarget. The one drawback of the spell is that should the caster lose focus for someunforeseen reason, the caster may have to contend with the likelihood of beinglost or losing her quarry.(Components)The most effective focus or sympathetic element of this spellwould either be a compass or loadstone, ritually charged expressly for this pur-pose and carried or worn on the caster’s person. Though a personally significantobject associated with travel, or a seeking rune, could always be used instead or inconjunction.AlacrityThis spell enables the caster to increase her own natural physical speed. This isaccomplished by the caster extending her senses into her own body. Once a stateof continuous biofeedback has been achieved she uses her magical will to increasethe output capacity of her muscles, tendons, and ligaments. This increase in out-put capacity will allow her body to propel her motion at much higher speeds aslong as she continuously feeds magical energy into the spell."},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"A Post-Modern Grimoire22(Components)This spell doesn’t simply make a person fast, it enhances whatphysical prowess is already present. Thus, the components for this spell are phys-ical fitness and the ability to use meditation or trance techniques to achieve bio-feedback.The Old Straight TrackThis divination spell both allows the caster to create a mental map of lay lines inthe area, but also to gather power from them by walking along them. First thecaster clears her mind, then she extends her senses as far as they will go, searchingfor hints of raw magical power, the area of her search limited only by her magicalprowess. Once her senses have picked up on the source, she extends her con-sciousness into these lines of power. Once she is hooked up to the “grid” of inter-locking ley lines, she will be able to walk along them. This is allows a magus withsufficient capacity to gather power from these lines like a whale feeding on plank-ton. Do be careful, as a high dose of raw power could severely shock or overloadand unwary magus.(Components)A dowsing rod would be very helpful, while one of wood is moreattuned to the wild natural power of the lines, any rod of any material will do.Perhaps a compass whose needle has been attuned to power instead of northwould work well. Loadstones or simple concentration are also quite effective.AlarmThis spell allows the caster to set up an invisible magical alarm system in a specificarea. T the caster weaves together sensitive strands of magical energy around thedesired area like a spider web. When the strands are disturbed they will silentlyalert the caster in an empathetic manner. The energy strands can be furtherstrengthened with traps, contingency spells, and secondary alarms to prevent cir-cumvention or the success of a counterspell.(Components)In the astral realm the visualization of the strands of energy isusually component enough. In the physical realm the caster may find aid in theuse of actual spider silk or cobwebs, but a bit of string tied around the perimeterwill also do the trick of focusing the spell during casting.Manifest RealityThis spell allows the caster to gradually change and warp the reality of a specificarea in the physical realm. Given that reality can be visualized and exists as a jum-ble of energy patterns, the mage makes subtle alterations to those patterns, slowly"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"A Post-Modern Grimoire23bending reality to his will. This spell is done by first becoming intimately awareand familiar with these local patterns. Then usually through sympathetic or visu-alized means, the caster channels energy into these patterns, slowly altering theirfundamental form. This is a process that takes time, yet when completed allowsthe caster to permanently alter the flow of energy, and therefore to a certainextent the output of those energies in the physical realm. Some examples of thisspell could be a mage heightening the tangible presence of magick in a specificarea, a mage causing an area to produce certain types of dreams when peoplesleep in a specific area, or perhaps the caster simply wants to change the generalpresence of a place. This is a slow moving spell and requires the expenditure of atremendous amount of energy, especially if a more permanent change is desired.(Components)Often the best method for this spell is deep meditation and thewillful manipulation of energy, following the energy shift like breathing so as tochange the fundamental elements of the area. Candle burning, incense smudging,and physical rituals such as dance are also effective, though must be repeated overtime, thus making the meditation method more viable on a practical materiallevel, as it does not require the constant replenishment of physical components.Affect LifelineThis spell can be used to reduce or increase the fundamental vitality of entitiesthat consciously move across the threads of time. The caster makes magical con-tact with a visualization of the lifeline of the target entity. Then the caster uses thewill to alter the lifeline’s pattern. The entity can be made to lose or gain vitality inan amount determined by the caster’s power and skill. This is a potent spell how-ever the changes will not be immediate, due to the subtle nature and invasivenessof the spell it will produce its effects over time. So while the effects of this spellwill take time to manifest the spell itself will be much more difficult to detect andcounter.(Components)The spell works best if the entity to be affected is touched insome way by the caster. For more potency and success the caster may find it use-ful to perform a more ritualistic version of the spell in which the caster touchesthe entity with a finger that has a bit of string attached to it. The string is laterused sympathetically and is either cut or lengthened with more string.DreamscapeThis spell gives the caster the ability to not only enter the dream of another, butto control and direct them as if the caster was in her own lucid dream. The casterenters into a meditative state and sends her astral self into the dreamscape. Once"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"A Post-Modern Grimoire24in the dreamscape the caster uses a pre-established connection with the target tofind their present dreaming. Then the caster enters the dream and changesaccording to her will, anything is possible. The caster can enter and alter thedream as subtly as being a non-intrusive and silent observer or as forward as rip-ping the dream apart and building an entirely new dream that the target is forcedto experience. The limitations of the control and influence over the target’sdreams are dependent upon the skill and power of the caster. Also, if the targetrealizes that the caster is the source then a battle of wills may begin for control ofthe dream.(Components)The components of such a spell are also the methods of castingthe spell. One needs to be skilled in meditation, powerful of will, and knowledge-able of the ways of the dreamscape. The connection that needs to be establishedbefore the spell is cast can be made with anything sympathetically linking thecaster and the target. It could be something positive like the relationship of a sig-nificant other or a flower from a friend, or as negative as a bit of hair or an objectonce owned by the target.ConcealThis spell enables the caster to render an object or entity effectively invisible. Thecaster uses his senses to become familiar with the patterns of the object or entityin question. Once knowledge of the make up of the target the caster then uses hismagical will to isolate the patterns within the target that allows other entities toperceive its presence by spatial awareness. The caster alters the spatial patterns ofthe target to resemble negative space instead of occupied space of the target’s size.If the target moves or is moved the spell will be much less effective unless energyis used by the caster to maintain the spell’s integrity in motion.(Components)When casting this spell on objects usually sprinkling some sandor dust on it will provide amble substance for focusing the will. For living beingsor spirits in the astral physically touching the target if it is not oneself is an effec-tive component. Also using conventional camouflaging techniques in conjunc-tion with the spell will aid in the spell’s potency.Ghost in the MachineThis spell allows the caster to alter a mechanical device at will without leavingtraces of the caster’s involvement or presence within the device. First the castermust make an empathetic link and familiarize himself with the device, otherspells exist for the accomplishment of this task. Once intimate with the device thecaster exerts his will upon the various mechanical patterns of the device to achieve"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"A Post-Modern Grimoire25the desired change. The caster can alter the efficiency output of the device, com-ponents and their functions can be altered, or the device could be rendered unus-able.(Components)Usually other components have already been used to establish theempathetic link with the machine and therefore there is no one component thatwould be overly helpful enough to mention once intimate with the machine.This is a spell of willful domination of the machine and requires no physical com-ponent for further potency.Machine EmpathyThis spell enables the caster to develop an empathetic rapport with any mechani-cal device, thus allowing the caster to manipulate and affect the device. The casteruses her senses to establish an empathetic link with the device, using her will ifnecessary to circumvent any defensive spells or the machine’s own stubbornness.Once the link is established the caster uses that link to gain impressions of themachine’s maker, function, components, and the mechanical relationshipsbetween those components. In essence the caster uses the link to gain a workingknowledge of the machine, what it does, how it does it, and how it can berepaired or sabotaged.(Components)Using a physical medium to establish the connection is veryeffective. This object could be a bauble, ring, or talisman that is attached to orlaid upon the device. The laying of hands upon the device, verbal incantations,and runes are also effective components.MantleThis spell, upon casting, encases the caster within a defensive energy field. Theuses her will to weave a field of defensive energies about herself, solidifying theminto a potent defense grid. This field will aid the caster in the natural avoidance ofphysical or magical harm. In essence this field will increase the chances of thecaster avoiding harm. The likelihood of tripping over something, the probabilityof a bullet striking home, or perhaps the odds of success for an offensive spellhurled at the caster of the field. It augments the caster’s natural defenses and cre-ates a field of probability in the caster’s favor. The spell remains until the casterchooses to no longer expend energy to maintain the field’s integrity.(Components)Any object that can be adjusted sympathetically would be tre-mendously helpful in this situation. An example would be a ring with a compart-ment that will open or close. Perhaps a watch with a dial switch or a glow stick"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"A Post-Modern Grimoire26necklace. Some sort of object that could sympathetically represent the turning onand off of the field.NullifyThis spell allows the caster to absorb, store, or redirect magical energy fromincoming spells and magical patterns. The caster of this spell focuses upon theincoming spell or pattern and nullifies it with his or her magical will. Immedi-ately after the moment of nullification there is a tremendous amount of formlessmagical energy which must be shaped to avoid the venting of volatile energy intothe immediate area. The caster may choose to absorb the energy and hurl a spellof her own, though if this route it taken the caster must be prepared to cast thenext spell reactively. The energy of the nullified spell may very well overload hersystem if it remains too long. Although a master with enough capacity maychoose to store the energy from the nullified spell for later use, this should onlybe done if the caster is confident in her capacity to handle such an addition to herown energy stores. The third option is to redirect the formless energy into anobject or other realm. To do this the caste must either have a physical item capa-ble of handling the energy input without breaking or be of sufficient skill andpower to safely shunt the energy into another realm without losing focus or con-trol.(Components)Personalized hand gestures accompanied by a verbal denial of theincoming spell or pattern.SummonsThis spell allows the caster to reach out with her power and force an entity tocome into her presence. The caster must be familiar with the intended target, themore detailed her knowledge the more powerful and difficult to resist the spellwill be when cast. The caster then uses that familiarity to distinguish that particu-lar entity from all others and establishes a magical connection with that entitythrough the caster’s senses. Then the caster uses her will to exert power over theentity and force it to come to her. The affected entity will then do everything inits power to reach the caster. The more powerful the caster the more powerful thesummons will be and the greater the distance that one can force the affectedentity to travel. The skill of the caster is what determines how much knowledgethe entity has of the reasons for its sudden need to be in whatever location thecaster is waiting.(Components)An object touched by the target entity or perhaps somethingonce possessed by the target are both very potent augmentations or foci for the"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"A Post-Modern Grimoire27spell. Facing a mirror with the object and using verbal components analogous tosummoning is a tremendously effective manner of casting this spell.RuinThis spell gives the caster the ability to rapidly age any inanimate object. Depend-ing upon the strength of the caster the amount of aging could be months, years,or even centuries. Under the influence of the spell wood rots, metal rusts andbecomes brittle, stone weathers, structures collapse, and machines fail. This isaccomplished by the magic user extending her senses into the object in questionand establishes a connection to it in the flow of time. Then the caster uses her willto increase the effects of time upon the object to the desired age. Like manyspells, this spell requires subtly and patience, for even in the astral realm it is pos-sible that it may take time for the object to begin to show the effects of the spell,given that the changes are fundamental, not superficial.(Components)Physically touching the target object is tantamount to the successof the spell, it allows for a more intimate and swift connection to the object in theflow of time. Verbal components may also be useful at this juncture.Silent AmbushThis spell allows the caster to setup traps within his own mind to ensnare anddamage intruders. The caster visualizes his mind as a grid, then places traps andsnares at various points upon the grid. These traps could be complex patterns thatsnare the intruder’s mind within the caster’s own, thus putting the invader at thecaster’s mercy. Or they could be as simple as sensitive areas within the mindscapethat blast intruders with raw energy in the attempt to destroy and expel theinvading mind. The complexity, power, and sensitivity of such mental devicesdepend upon the skill, focus, and power of the caster and the frequency whichthe caster refreshes such defenses.(Components)There are no helpful components other than the ability of themagic user to visualize the casting of such a spell."},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"28Epoch✦(A Ceremonial Working)The stage is dark, save the spotlight that illuminates the solitary figure on stage.The Voice of History: I am the Voice of History.

I don’t want this to be more difficult than it already has too. Begone!The black being under the table and the one under the desk quickly, almost as ifthey were frightened, leave their hiding places and flee into the dark wall. Devlinsits down and opens the center drawer of the desk. He takes out a picture frame,maybe his family, and looks at it long and hard. Eventually he sets it on top of thedesk in front of him. He takes a deep breath, sits back and check his watch.Devlin:The children should be in bed by now. As well they should be, they willhave a busy day tomorrow.

Kaine is noticeably youngerthan Devlin, and seems very aggressive in his posture and attitude. The manbehind him is silent and moves to flank Kaine as if he were a bodyguard. Lewislooks very alarmed but stands his ground. It seems as if Lewis is going to fightboth of the newcomers when Devlin diplomatically breaks the silence.Devlin:Ah, Kaine. Welcome.

Control of the multitudes of human-ity will be wretched from the hands of our modern rulers and their governments.Dogma will become a relic of times soon to be left behind. It will be a time ofspiritual anarchy. It will be a time in which all religions, all creeds, and all spiri-tual paths must reevaluate and redefine themselves in a world where all roads canlead to paradise or desolation.Religion has for millennia been the differentiating and defining factor in therelationships amongst human groups. Be these relationships of commerce, mar-riage, warfare, or territory. Religion has been the way in which humans haveidentified “us” and “them”. If there is only one right faith, and one group is inpossession of that faith, it becomes easier on a psychological level to enter intoconflict with other “divine” groups. Throughout human history religions beginwith the well meaning and insightful ideas and experience of one or a few indi-viduals who come into contact with the divine, and end up being used as vehiclesfor control by those whom inherit or seize leadership. Religion has been the justi-fying banner on many unjustified battlefields.This basic truth is also fundamental in the history and future of Empires.They begin as provocatively bold movements full of enthusiasm and ideals, andend up being the oppressive systems they were created to replace. So both Empireand Religion, birthed of creativity and passion, are destined to fail. There is how-ever, a third element to this system of revolution/institution/decay, it is Com-merce. Just as the varieties of religions and governments are many, so are thesystems of commerce, and like the institutions of Religion and Empire, Com-merce fails again and again as time churns on.Islam, Christianity, Hinduism, Wicca, Democracy, Communism, Monarchy,Capitalism, Socialism, Bartering; all of these systems and institutions fail becauseof one thing.

If they become too solid, too organized, too stable, the fun-damental elements of Reality tear them down.In the wake of the New Aeon we are at this point of meltdown. How can weas a species cope with this bleak time when all we build seems meant to collapseand fail? The answer is neither easy nor overly palpable for those who cannot takethe long view of our continued survival and success as a species.Feudalism is the most basic and natural way of life. Once feudalism is clearlydefined its governing tenants can be seen throughout nature as well as humansociety. Feudalism is the eternal symbiotic relationship between Ruler, Protector,and Provider. In medieval times the Rulers were the monarchs, the Protectorswere knights, and the serfs the Providers. In bee colonies the Queen is the Ruler,the warrior drones are the Protectors, and the worker bees are the Providers. Thismetaphor of Ruler, Protector, and Provider can be as grand as the interpretationof Earth as Ruler, humanity as Protector, and Earth’s other creatures as Providers.While this view is somewhat romantically in favor of human kind as the Protec-tors of Earth, but it is certainly closer to the actual state of affairs, all illusionsaside, than seeing humanity as the Rulers. Or this metaphor can be as minute asto apply it to the fundamentals of cellular existence. It is arguable that what shallbe called feudalism is a universal and completely natural system of life. With feu-dalism seen as a natural system it can be easily identified in most relationships,from Earth to Organism.In the New Aeon our eyes will be opened to the spiritual connections amongstourselves, our religions, and Reality itself. As stated previously, in this state ofspiritual anarchy our social climate will reflect this turmoil. As the global ascen-sion occurs the element of Religion in humanity will reach equilibrium with timeand chance, becoming adapted to it. Ascension by its very nature is a conditionwhich allows spirituality and belief to ebb and flow alongside time and chaos,solid enough to support the soul but flexible enough to allow it to grow andchange. From this ascension the institutions of Religion will rise and fall, as istheir nature, but it will be the growing pains of evolution, not the warfare ofdogma. The other two elements, Commerce and Empire, will coalesce in thisnew world. While in much of human history Empire and Commerce have beenvery distinguishable entities, soon they will become One.In our modern world, as well as much of the ancient, the institution of Empirechanges its visage often. While Commerce does not. Kings and armies come andgo, but trade routes tend to remain unchanged and ever flowing. In the present,the Information Age and Global Market has allowed for the radical proliferationof a vessel of Commerce known as the Corporation. These business conglomer-"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"NEW AEON: Theoretical Analog for Fundamental Change41ates are entities in and of themselves. The human element exists within the con-fines of the corporation, yet no one person has complete control over a longenough timeline to affect its overall evolution. Corporations to not die with theirfounders, they lumber on, buoyed by those in lower ranks moving up the ever-present corporate ladder.As the Global Ascension sets in, the power of governments and despots willdissolve. The working public will no longer support social parasites, unjust con-trol from corporate leaders, or the work-a-day lifestyle. The general public willexpect and demand the time, tranquility, and funding to exercise their spiritualfreedom and newfound insight. The corporations will see the need to complywith such demands, afterall, they are made up of people with in the same spiritualcondition. The institutions of Empire and Commerce will become one. The cor-porations will become Empires, with the upper leadership levels of the corpora-tions serving as the Rulers.

Most people operate within theProgram, magi, called Programmers, have learned to actively change the Programfrom within. Physical reality within the Program itself, which could be known asthe Interface, is the output of the Program as it runs. Programmers can changethe data within the Program itself to produce changes in the Interface.What we perceive as physical objects are called data clusters. Once one learnsto reprogram a particular type of cluster one could alter the data in it, allowingone to change an object’s fundamental patterns.

Like the firewalls and network security software of mun-dane computer systems, ICE is an empowered security routine that protects theProgrammer while working with the Interface. The first thing the caster does is“plug in”, connecting with the Interface. Once inside the first task is to summonup magical energy, then shaping it into an aura-like field that surrounds thecaster, a halo if you would. This spell acts like a shield, though an extremelyaggressive one. Instead of simply blocking incoming spells or spirits, the ICE willactually assault the threat, using its own energy in the attempt to deflect and dis-rupt. While no ICE will ever be more effective than constant vigilance on thepart of the Programmer, it serves as a potent early warning system, and oftenserves to weaken a threat significantly before being circumvented. This of courseallowing the Programmer both the time to power up a secondary response, but toslow and weaken the incoming threat.

Then one would need the actual physicalupper consumables.Download SpiritThis spell is the Reality Hacker version of a summoning and binding spell rolledinto one function. By extending his or her senses into the Operating System, aProgrammer of sufficient skill and power can sense the subtle currents and pro-grams in the Interface. The Programmer then codes a quick search spell, muchlike the basic search engine in a mundane internet browser, and keys in the searchparameters to the specifics of the spirit or entity that the Programmer wishes tointeract with. Once the results of the search come back, the magic user then usesthat retrieved data cluster to establish a magical connection with the target. Oncethis connection is established the Programmer can both summon and bind theentity, effectively “downloading” the entity into whatever medium is desired.(Components)The Programmer will need a repository into which to downloadthe entity. This could be as esoteric as a software application or data clusterwithin the Interface, or as physical as a floppy disk, the computer’s harddrive, orhand held device.Soul HackingThis is the most potent and invasive spell in the Programmer’s database of spells.Through the use of the coding trance and a powerful magical connection to thetarget, the Programmer is able to hack the spirit of another being in the same waythat a mundane hacker would a simple computer. First the Programmer mustobtain a very potent connective element of the target. The specifics of the ele-ment are entirely dependent upon the personal paradigm of the Programmer, butin any case should be as closely related to the target as possible. Then, using thatmagical connection, the Programmer breaches the natural spiritual defenses ofthe target. Like any computer system, the target will, even if unaware of theintrusion, defend itself. So it is best to have a solid offensive array of software pre-pared before the intrusion is made.

The ebb and flow of the currents of wealth can be seen by the keenobserver. Wealth flows along trade routes, pools in banks, forms eddies in thepalm of a consumer. By controlling one’s body and spirit with calm meditativetrances, the principle may contemplate, become familiar with, and gain subtlecontrol of the flow of wealth.Using visualization the Principal should see the flow of wealth energies asgolden waters, flowing throughout the world.

The Market Crashand Market Projection spells work off the same basic principles. For the Crash,which is intended to be a magically induced stock market crash in the mundanemarket, one simply shatters the Market, dispersing its energies in all directions,causing wealth redistribution and a net loss for all.

Eclecticism is ofcourse the sampling and combination of many, often radically opposed or differ-ent, viewpoints, ideas, beliefs, and practices. Mana, a word borrowed fromPolynesian warrior culture, is the magical power of presence, attitude, and per-sonality. In other words, the power of goth magick comes from within, is shapedby eclecticism, and expressed through mana.Goth magick, in many ways, is the reflection of the social scene from which ithas been born. Disassociative elements are thrown into stark relief against oneanother, the resulting conflict being a source of internal power for the goth mage.This is how the goth mage is able to tap the power of paradox and look cooldoing it. It is in this way that one could witness a goth mage using a oujia boardand a calculator to cast spells without the least bit of hesitation or self-conscious-ness. This is why the goth is able to call upon the most primal elements of life,sweat, blood, tears, even while presenting a personal style associated with deathand urban sprawl. It is magick, witchcraft, dimestore voodoo and pop culture allrolled up into one. Goth mages exist at the event horizon between the orderedpatterns of the city and the wild chaos of nature unbridled.By using an eclectic approach they are able to pick and choose for themselvesfrom among the various magical traditions of the world. Thus each goth mage isable to develop his or her own style of magick as seen fit on a personal level. Forthe goth mage, personal relevance is paramount. By sticking only to what is per-sonally relevant, the goth mage ends up with an eclectic system of magick that isnot only completely unique, but one hundred percent relevant. There is a certaindisregard for rules and traditions within their ranks, and therefore more meaningis placed on what works for the individual as opposed to what culture and tradi-tion dictate.It is at this point that mana become central to the goth mage’s craft. Theamount and potency of mana for a goth mage can be the difference between adramatic ritual’s overwhelming success or debilitating failure. Mana is expressedin many ways. It could be simply looking cool on the dance floor, or it could be"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"Magick in the Dark52appearing completely valid holding a sword and calling out ritual verses by can-dlelight.Mana is the power of the self on a magical/social level. Mana is showing up asa stranger at a club or coffeehouse and being seen as a magical peer or superiorupon arrival. It is a delicate combination of personal presentation, confidencewithout the need for approval, and the palpable aura of power. Mana not onlyprovides social status and influence, but allows the goth mage to successfully pullof spells with spectacular results that would otherwise not be easily done.Rivals can be magically silenced with a gesture, members of the opposite sexmanipulated, and the energy levels of the area influenced. Mana is a powerfulasset when performing rituals and others such magicks in the presence of wit-nesses. Though as much of a power boost as man is, it is mostly a social element,and it must be kept in mind that there are goth mages out there with no realmana to speak of who are quite powerful. It is just that those with mana haveaccess to a most puissant advantage.When taken in as a whole, goth magick by its nature produces a fringe ele-ment within an already outcast subculture. This results in three sorts of mages.The most populace being the covens of goths unified by their pursuit of magick.They are generally loyal to at least each other and keenly interested in group prac-tice. The second group can be seen as the predators. They are the sexual abusers,mind control groups, and general magical miscreants and self-proclaimed“Satanists”. Fortunately their magick is weak, but if allowed to remainunchecked, their mana will grow quite strong. The best method of eliminatingthis threat however, is easy. Ignore them, and their powers will fade. The third, ofcourse, is the loner. The shadow in the crowd.

Once under the spell the target will begin, on a subtle level, to experienceand perceive the world as it really is. They will see spirits hiding in corners, hearsecrets pass between unseen lips, and will be forced to see that magick IS real. Theeffects of the spell are temporary, but sufficient to force the target to questiontheir values, dogma, and sense of self. This spell is simply and energy field placedupon the target that heightens their level of enhanced perception.

This is an especially useful spell, given thatmost goth mages are quite striking in appearance. The caster summons up theawareness and palpable presence of the crowd, and uses it to overpower her ownpresence, both physically and spiritually. Her pattern will be permeated and over-taken by that of the crowd, thus only the most earnest of seekers will be able tosingle her out. Once blended and blanketed by the crowd the mage must remainin proximity of the group in order to maintain the spell.(Components)Usually none are used physically other than physical attempts atinclusion and perhaps a talisman or fetish item created specially to focus thepower of the mage towards that very spell.Bum a Dollar from the UniverseBy using this spell the goth mage in financial despair is able to summon forthcash, seemingly as if from thin air. The caster summons up an energy pattern thatis attuned to cash and visualizes grafting it to his or her own aura. Then the casterwalks the streets, the spell enhancing and attuning the senses to subtle currents ofreality in relation to money. The result of the spell is that the caster is able to bethe person who “finds” the loose change and lost bills in the immediate environ-ment. While this seems like a small time sort of spell, an extra five dollars couldget you out of tight spot someday. An extra quarter or two could mean the differ-ence between going hungry and not.

The mage focuses upon the target while forging a connection, be itsympathetic or purely an energy bond. Then, while the link is active, the casterintroduces massive amounts of entropy energy patterns into the life of the targetwith extreme negative intentions.

The use ofmana in this spell is somewhat limited, given that once the spell’s presence isnoticed it can be struggled against, so is best done in secret.Goth GlamourEveryone makes a big deal about dressing up to go out, but goth mages make thismundane activity into a powerful ritual. They play carefully selected music whiletaking great care with each nuance of clothing, make-up, and jewelry. Withimmaculate precision or haphazard application, the goth mage weaves a spellupon themselves. It is a highly individual act, yet every glamour simultaneouslyas armor, a persona, and any specific element the goth mage chooses to present.This could be a presentation of power, a force that compels others to protect orpay attention to the caster, or even a seductive or repulsive pattern that works atthe caster’s behest.

Plus coffee is full of caffeine and justtastes good.(Components)A cup of coffee or other beverage. It work best to either hold thecup, breathe into it, or stir it. This is a very physical spell, and physical actionstransmit the spell best."},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"57The Marauder UndergroundWarbringerThere is another world out there, in fact there exists within the space of onebreath an infinity of worlds. All of which cannot be seen with naked eyes, heardwith ears unaided or touched by physical means. Yet these worlds are all closelytied to our own, just as ours is to each and everyone of them. We exist in a multi-verse, fueled by the breath of God. There exists about this plethora of realms onlyone Reality. The Veil that covers the Inner Eye deceives us with illusions of mul-tiple realities with no ties to one another. This illusion leads to others, the separa-tion of religions, gender roles, the existence of races and nations. These are thelies of the ignorant and the blind, the Illusion of Singularity, the belief that anyreality is separate or better than another. Each universe, each realm, each reality isnothing more nothing less than the other. They are all facets in the Eye of God.And you, you must see with your Inner Eye, a war is being waged right now. Allaround you and within you forces struggle for dominance in the shaping of Real-ity in your hearts and minds, and your world. There is only one Reality, butbecause of the existence of the Veil you and everyone you know is blinded to theTruth. You live in a world of self-imposed limitations, a world shaped by a con-sensual reality that you chain yourself too. Believe me when I tell you that a warrages across the multiverse, and you are at the center of it, everything is. It is a warfor Reality, it is a war of illusions. A war in which those who believe themselves tohave the Truth attempt to shape Reality in their image. Like all things there isgood and bad in this, it is at least better to choose a side and take a stand ratherthan decay to nothing in a cesspool of indecision and cowardice. Even if yourcause is an illusion and your heard blind, it would be better that you die againstthe ramparts of faith than not live at all. Every step you take towards God, even ifyou are walking in the darkness of ignorance, God runs a thousand to you, even-tually you will find each other. I am here to tell you that the war is going tochange. We will tear down the walls of the Veil to build bridges to other realms.We will make the world such that one must look with the Inner Eye or be drivenmad. Everywhere and inside all things heaven and hell will be one place, madness"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"The Marauder Underground58and reason will be one and the same, dreams and nightmares will no longer stopwhen you wake. We will see all the worlds as they are, One. Then we will all seethe Truth. As a species we will finally be free.Magical TerrorismAn act of terrorism tends to be one of violence committed against those who arenot capable of protecting themselves from such an assault. There is also anagenda that goes along with these actions, that is what separates these directedacts of violence from random attacks. Most are political, with small groups usingterrorism in order to be heard by the majority. Some can be religious, in truththere are any myriad of reasons for terrorism. What I will discuss there is magicalterrorism. The use of magic to commit acts of terrorism against a world unaware.What is the goal or agenda? The agenda is to spread enough chaos and vulgarmagic that the eyes of the blind are pried open, to bring magic back to the worldif you will. Magical terrorism is the weapon for those who would see the worldchanged. Terrorism is also the weapon of the outnumbered and the hunted. Suchis the state of affairs for a mage seeking to change the world. You will be huntedbecause you will be seen by most as the villain, even by other magic users, perhapsthem even more so because they can perceive the full extent of the damage beingdone. If it takes being the villain to do what we must, then so be it. By makingthe barrier between the realms thinner, by being antagonistic with magical acts,by being who we are really are with no apologies or disclaimers, we force theworld to deal with us. And all eyes will turn towards you, and you will be thehated redeemer. What follows are some examples of what could possibly be con-sidered magical terrorism in the name of global ascension."},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"59ArsenalPlague ArksFrom the Old Testament book of Exodus come the Ark of the Covenant. TheGod of the Hebrews instructed the tribes to build a vessel in which the covenantwith Israel would be stored. The ark is two and a half cubits long, a cubit and ahalf wide, a cubit and a half high, it had four rings, two on each side throughwhich ashen poles were placed in order to carry it. The lid was crowned with twogriffin like angels. When captured by enemies the presence of the ark caused dis-ease and madness. The plague ark is a deliberate perversion of the actual ark.Built the same way, but instead of gold it is coated in a mixture of paint and theblood of those involved with its construction. The inside is filled with sand whichshould fill the box half-full and cover the Unraveling Rune burned into the bot-tom of the inside of the ark. The ark can be used in two ways. The first is themore subtle and long-term method. The ark is constructed and then hidden in ornear an energy nexus from where is can cause the most damage. Possible areaswould be in the sewers underneath prominent areas such as downtown areas,town squares, office buildings, churches, theatres, arenas, etc. The magic of theark will gradually inflict potent nightmares and madness upon the city and wearthe world barriers thin. The second way to use the ark is much more immediate,but much more risky on the part of the builders. The lid is removed and thebuilders carry the ark openly through the streets. The effects are the same thoughmuch more potent, and the barriers are much weaker in the presence of such apowerful weapon.PlaguebearerGo into a meditative trance after purifying oneself for whatever amount of timeone feels appropriate, keeping in mind that in most cases the longer and moreencompassing the cleansing is the more potent the spell. Once in this meditativetrance you will shape the energies of reality into an act of creation and summon-ing. You will visualize a virus spirit, once it is the only thing you are focused onfeed it energy, make it stronger. After the spirit is empowered summon it to you,"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"Arsenal60this can be done in whatever manner you choose. For the sake of this example Iwill say that one should summon the spirit through inhaling smoke. Then onebreaths the smoke into the host of the virus spirit, be it an animal, insect, or otherperson, even oneself. The virus spirit can then propagate itself using the host. Theaffects of the virus spirit depend on what sort of spirit you choose to conjure up.Also, wear a sigil of protection so that the virus cannot affect you.Poisoning the SpiritIn a ritual vessel mix an amount of wormwood with water. Focus your will uponthe mixture and breathe a visualization of the Unraveling Rune into the vessel.Once this process has been repeated enough times that the caster is no longercomfortable keeping the vessel in the home, it is ready. Take this vessel of spiri-tual poison and deposit its contents into the drinking supply of whatever popu-lated area one is targeting. Ingestion of the tainted water will over time causemadness, nightmares, and thin the barriers within those affected persons.GatesPortals and pathways between the worlds still exist, usually in sacred or strangeplaces like haunted places, remote or isolated wilderness, certain landlocked bod-ies of water and other places in the waters of the world, etc. There is nothing thatcan stop you from opening a gateway and leaving it open, in fact holding it open.Simply find a place whose energies seem to be conducive to a pathway, and rip ahole in reality and hold it open. Use portal runes to make the gate, the powerfocused through the runes will hold it open. Remember to check back from timeto time to keep the runes fresh and in place.Magical Gifts and GiveawaysThis one is fun, and not quite so invasive, much more subtle but effective nonethe less. Make little talismans and single spell items, rune jewelry, and other suchtrinkets. Give them away to random people. Sometimes they will refuse, otherswill take them and leave, and others still will remain with interest and questions.All of them will be effected on some level.Art and MusicThese mediums are also just as effective at producing, channeling, and expressingmagic as they are emotion and thought. Listen to the tribal music of the ancientsand you will know. Read some folk myth and you will know."},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"LIBER IV"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"62The Corpus HermeticumThe 4th Book of Occult PhilosophyThe Grimoirium VerumThe Greater & Lesser Keys of SolomonTheurgia GoetiaThe Books of Ambralein the MageThe Alexandiran Book of ShadowsThe Old Testament Book of LeviticusThe Epic of GilgameshThe Papyrus of AniThe Book of the Law"}]
