In fact, mostof the powerful magicians on our planetdo not even know the tree of life. Such\"lack of knowledge\" does not inhibit theirpower at all. Evidently there must besome principle in magic that goes beyondreligious doctrine. There must be a magi-cal science that we can develop from thecommon functioning principle (CFP) of allmagic. Equalling magic with the tree oflife or any other outcropping of religiouscreeds would be to falsely identify the mapwith the territory. The map is never theterritory it represents! Such identifica-tion is always wrong, no matter how use-ful the map may be at first.The magical systems that have their rootsin the tree of life have been useful and tosome extent comprehensive. However,the universe is not the tree of life. Thetree of life is just another mapping that isof use for the magician.The present time sees an expan-sion of magical methods that is unheardof as yet. At the same time students ofmagic have access to an increasingly wideLESSON Irange of very different magical systemsand traditions to practice. Most of thesesystems are not outcroppings of a Judeo-Christian religionism. Moreover, they areincompatible with the cabalistic systemand its tree of life, but equally powerfuland at least equally spiritual. It is myopinion that the tree of life and all otherreligious mappings have no predominantusefulness for the magician of the thirdmillennium who practices magic on a sci-entific basis. The science of magic in itstrue form is a science, not a religious actas thought until now. In the old daysmagic was forbidden, religion had to beused as a coverup, hiding the true magi-cal form which is finally out in the opentoday. I will show in the following lessonswhy this is so.This course willintroduce you to thecommon functioningprinciples of all knownmagical practices andsystems. It is a mod-ern approach thattranscends the quietlyassumed connectionbetween magicalpractice and specificreligious doctrines.This approach will al-low you to come to ascientific understand-ing of the processesthat underlie allknown forms ofmagic.Then you will realize that the religiousclothing of the practice is different in ev-ery culture and that you need no reli-Tel. 770 924 0223 www.hscti.com - e-mail: sales@hscti.com 3"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"gious facade at all to be a powerful magi-cian.If you use your car to drive some-where you are free to pray five Lord'sprayers and three Hail Marys' or you mayeven chant the sacred \"OM\" one hundredand eight times before you start your ve-hicle.

At a very early age, he hasdeveloped a fascination for sciencein general and for the stars inparticular.Consequently, he has read eagerly anybook on astronomy, astrophysics, mathematicsand physics that he could get hold of. At age 16,he became interested in the subject of hypnosis.He began studying this discipline, later heperfected Autogenic Training and eventually, atage 18, he began the practice of Hatha Yoga.This practice strengthened his then frail bodywithin a few weeks and his overall condition andhealth improved considerably. Quite naturally,these spectacular results gave Karl an incentiveto explore other sciences that were not part ofhis academic curriculum. Studies and practicein astrology, practical magic, rune magic, andpractice of various forms of life energytechnology such as astral traveling andclairvoyance followed within one year. He studiedthe works of Mesmer, Korschelt, vonReichenbach, Tesla, Lahkowski, and others. Atage 19, Karl began his graduate studies inmathematics and physics. Several times, heinterrupted his academic studies to travelextensively. In the course of these travels, hegained valuable information about magicalpractices and the use of life force in manycultures and traditions and he met many giftedteachers and adepts on the subject matter. During his stays in South Africa,Switzerland, Berlin, and, since 1974, the UnitedStates of America, he continued his studies, whichhe then rounded off with general semantics,radionics, Reichian psychology, and orgonephysics. Shortly after his arrival in the UnitedStates, he built his first orgone accumulators andconducted multiple experiments with theseamazing devices. It was obvious that what Reichcalled orgone was the same form of energy thathe had explored for more than a decade beforeknowing of Reich. In fact, a device he built yearsearlier following the plans of Korschelt was anorgone accumulator. Korschelt called his devicea “Solar Ether Radiation Apparatus” — its plansare dating back to 1897. Mesmer’s barrels withiron filings, also built and tested by Welz yearsbefore he studied Reich, were obviously theearliest orgone accumulators of which we knowthat were built by a scientist with theaccumulation of life force in mind. Therefore,we can safely say that Franz Anton Mesmer hasinvented the life force accumulator one and ahalf centuries before Reich. Soon he realized that orgone can beprojected at any distance and that this projectionfollows structural links. This is a fact that wasevident to people of all ages and cultures whoharnessed life force, such as shamans, conjurers,spiritual workers, magicians, and healers. Forthis type transfer he had to develop a"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"practice and a no- nonsense guide to de-velop the skills that are helpful in this prac-tice.WHAT IS MAGIC?I do not plan to burden you downwith a proper definition of this word im-mediately. You know that with the wordmagic we describe a specific class of prac-tices that we can use to bring aboutchange. In the following we will examinewhat type of practices fall under the defi-nition of magic and what the elements ofthese practices are. From this we will de-velop an elementary mapping, or theory,that will help you understand the varioustechnologies, or systems, of magic anddevelop your magical skills easily and rap-idly.Let's begin with a few scenarios ofwell-known practices that we call \"magic.\"Case #1: An old recipe to heal a personis to pull seven hairs of that person. Thendrill a hole into a vigorous tree and putthe seven hairs into the hole. Then plugthe hole with the wood of the same tree.The person will feel better.Case #2: A \"doctor\" fabricates a doll.He puts hair and fingernails, or clothing,of the target into the doll. Then, perhapsat a precalculated time, he goes to agraveyard and puts the doll into an opengrave. The person whom he targets mayget sick, perhaps may even die.Case #3: An old recipe against woundsthat pus: Take some of the pus out of thewound with a cotton swab and put it intocopper sulfate. The wound heals a lotfaster.Case #4: Set up a ceremonial table withcandles, incenses, etc. On a piece of pa-per draw a square with some letters in-Tel. 770 924 0223 www.hscti.com - e-mail: sales@hscti.com 5mathematical model that accounts for thisphenomenon. This model also accounts for manyof the amazing phenomena of ESP, magic,radionics, even astrology. In 1992, he invented the orgonegenerator®. This extraordinary new device is asignificant step beyond the mere accumulatingof orgone energy as happens inside the orgoneaccumulator. Furthermore he realized soon thatpulsed orgone energy (which an orgonegenerator can produce — or a rotating planet)transforms DOR (deadly orgone) back intoorgone energy. The problem of “orgoneaccumulators going bad” when afflicted by DORwas successfully counteracted with atechnological device for the first time in knownhistory. More striking proof of this characteristicof orgone generators® became evident whenhe invented a DOR generator. The orgonegeneratorsTM proved to be effective incounteracting the negative effects of devices thatdevelop DOR when operating, such asradioactive smoke detectors, fluorescent tubes,TV screens, and other electromagnetic pollution.The orgone accumulating devices on the otherhand, are ineffective. In fact, these devices “foulup”, i.e., when exposed to deadly orgone (DOR)too long, they accumulate it and consequentlybecome centers of this energy. Soon Karl Welz recognized that theorgone generator® can be a significant help inmany practices involving the use of life energy(or orgone) such as the development and practiceof ESP, magic, self improvement, and trendgeneration with the help of astrological energies.Extensive testing confirmed that orgone that ispulsed in low frequencies (Alpha, Theta, Deltastates, etc.) is considerably more effective tocause the corresponding brain wave states thanany one of the now obsolete methods that usesound, light, or electric pulses.The orgone generator® has been on themarket since early 1993. Tens of thousands ofpeople all over the world who decided to havean edge in their aspirations are now the proudowners of these devices. In 1994, Mr. Welzinvented a new orgone accumulating material(orgonite®) that is significantly more effectivethan the traditional materials such as layers ofsteel wool and fiberglass or celotex.

Using apendulum or the stick pad on the device,she determines the settings of the dialsthat help in lawsuits. Then she puts thephoto of the person whom she helps onthe stick pad. She leaves the device \"on\"until the results show.Case #6: In a charismatic church thepreacher initiates a prayer to heal in hiscongregation. The person that he intendsto heal is far away.ACTION AT A DIS-TANCEWhat do these cases have in com-mon? The first thing that comes into ourminds is the following:MAGIC IS ACTIONIt is action that has the goal tobring about a change: change in an indi-vidual, in a group of individuals, or of asituation. The attempt to bring change isa characteristic of all living beings. It isinteraction with the environment.The second common denominatorof these cases is that the target of theaction appears to be distant. For themoment, we can say:MAGIC IS ACTION AT A DISTANCE.DISTANCE IS IRRELEVANT INMAGICAL WORK.In this respect, magic expands ourcapability to act upon our environment.STRUCTURAL LINKSNow let's consider a third impor-tant factor: In every case the magicianuses something that represents the tar-get of the action.Case #1: Seven hairs (with follicles)Case #2: Hair and FingernailsCase #3: The same bacteria that are inthe wound.Case #4: The written names and thevisual imagination of the people.Case #5: The Photo of the person.Case #6: The visual imagination in themind of the people who send the healing.Magicians usually call this represen-tative of the target, such as hair, finger-nails, a photo, or clothing, \"The psychiclink.\" For our purpose of putting magicinto a scientific language, we prefer theterm \"structural link.\" The structural linkcan be in any form that rhanges frompurely physical to purely mental, or imag-ined.6 Tel. 770 924 0223 www.hscti.com - e-mail: sales@hscti.com"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"If we analyze the six cases abovewe come to the following conclusion: Theuse of a structural link to the target makesits distance to the magical operator irrel-evant.MAGIC IS ACTION UPON THE EX-TENDED UNIVERSE, OR ACTION AT ADISTANCE.

To find out we need to comparemagical practices that bring results withthose that do not work. The observationof magicians throughout the ages showedthat a magical practice fails to bring theexpected results for one of two reasons:1. there is psychic defense, blockage, orany other interference.2. there is insufficient psychic energyraised.The first point will be the object ofa later lesson. You will learn about psy-chic defense and how to overcome inter-ference.The second point calls for furtherexamination. We want to analyze whatmagicians do when they practice their art.Case #1: The magician does nothing.Is the power with the tree?Case #2: It works even if the magiciandoes not raise a lot of psychic energy,especially if the structural link to the tar-get person is good, such as hair, finger-nails, or clothing.Case #3: No psychic energy is neces-sary.Case #4: This works only if the magi-cian develops and projects a lot of psy-chic power.Case #5: It seems that trained magi-cians or strongly emotional persons havequicker success with radionics than oth-ers.Case #6: In a charismatic setting theemotional power is at a peak.Magicians of all ages knew of thenecessity to develop strong psychic pow-ers, or magical powers, to be successful.Only if the structural link is excellent andwhen life energy is abundant from somesource other than themselves do they notneed to raise these powers. They real-ized that life energy is the medium thatmakes magical action possible. In fact,our research has proven that life itselfwould be impossible without magical in-teraction with a distant environment:NO LIFE WITHOUT MAGIC!A strong field of life force allowsquick magical action. The stronger thelife energy that connects with the target,the stronger the action upon the targetwill be. Magicians of all ages knew that.This power had many names such asPrana, Chi, Psychic Power, Magical Power,and Mana.In Western countries several sci-entists have established scientific modelsof this energy. The models that they de-veloped were in tune with the knowledgeof their times. A scientific model has manyadvantages.

This fact isas valid for magic as it is valid for chemis-try and physics!The first person known in Westernhistory who developed a scientific modelof life energy was Franz Anton Mesmer.He called life energy \"animal magnetism.\"He developed methods to magnetize(\"mesmerize\") people for healing. He alsoset up devices that brought on a healing.These devices were wooden barrels thathe had filled with iron filings and that hadiron rods sticking out. People who wanteda healing held these rods in their hands.Baron von Reichenbach called lifeenergy \"Odic Force.\" He conducted thou-sands of tests with more than a hundredsensitive people and he developed a com-prehensive theory concerning this energy.Wilhelm Reich used the term\"Orgone\" for life energy. His scientifictheory was the most advanced model oflife energy until the development of hyperspace mathematics. Wilhelm Reich in-vented the orgone accumulator. He usedthis device to charge people with life en-ergies for a healing. He expanded on de-scribing the characteristics of life energy.Magicians knew all along that lifeenergy is necessary to make their actionswork. They knew \"intuitively\" about it.Magicians usually can feel this energy. Onthe basis of millennia of experience, theyuse many practices to develop strongfields of this energy. These practicesinclude many different methods such aschanting, strong emotional outbursts,group rituals, sex magical practices, reli-gious emotionalism, and animal sacrifice.An excellent way to have a continuous andabundant supply of life energy is to usethe life energy (chi) generators that I in-vented.

WHAT ISIMPORTANT IS THE STRENGTH OFTHE LIFE FORCE AND THE ACCURACYOF THE STRUCTURAL LINKS.The first thing that we need to doin order to understand magic is to cometo grips with its basic elements. Thismeans that we need to learn to under-stand the characteristics of life force andthe nature of structural links. Then weneed to learn the methods to raise lifeforce and the methods to establish struc-tural links. With such an understandingwe can perform any kind of magic. Withsuch an understanding will we view magicas a technological system rather thansome mysterious art that is cloaked insome kind of distorted religious beliefstructures.After we have developed a basicunderstanding of life force and of struc-tural links, we will proceed to increase therange of our sensory apparatus. This willallow us to tune into the effects of ourmagical action. It is always better to \"see\"the target rather than do something\"blindly\" in the hope that the technologywe employed will do the trick.

Life force provides uswith the \"medium,\" so to say, that allowstransfer by means of structural links.Magicians of all ages knew that. Theytaught practices to work with life force.Often these practices became so interwo-ven with religious practice that peoplewere incapable of realizing the essenceof the magical practice. They confoundedthe expression of raw life force with thespecific religious practice that they use tomake it appear. Quite naturally theythought it was the religious practice thatcaused the \"miracle\" to happen. Fromthere it was just a small step to the wrongassumption that only their specific reli-gion could deliver such miracles. Ifmiracles happened in other religious sys-tems, they logically interpreted them asbeing the work of the force that opposedtheir religion such as the devil in the Chris-tian religion. The \"miracles\" appeared nolonger as results of an applied technol-ogy, but as events that only happenedwithin their specific creed. Miracles, then,found their explanation only in terms ofsuch a specific religious doctrine. Fromthis attitude it was only a small step tothe arrogant academic attitude that de-nies the existence of life force all together.To the magician who learned tothink in scientific terms life force hasgained a new importance. Scientific think-ing helps us understand what's really go-ing on when we apply a technology. Itprovides us with the mapping that we canuse to explain technologies that evolvedfrom experience of trial and error. Map-pings that we develop with the help ofscientific thinking will help us find newtechnologies. Therefore it is long over-due to bring about a scientific approachto the manifestations of life force.In this lesson you will learn to ex-plore and use raw psychic energy, or lifeforce.LIFE FORCE FOLLOWSNEGATIVE ENTROPYThe research of Wilhelm Reich wasa giganitc step towards our scientific un-derstanding of the characteristics of lifeforce. This is so because Wilhelm Reichwas the first scientist who recognized thatlife force, or orgone (as he called it) fol-lows the principle of negative entropy. Tounderstand this principle, let's first explainwhat we mean with entropy. Entropy is aterm that appears in physics. Physicistsobserved that two energy systems of dif-ferent potentials end up with the samepotential some time after they came incontact with each other. We call this pro-cess of establishing balance entropy. Forinstance, if you bring a hot object in con-tact with a cold object, both objects willhave the same temperature after sometime. One object will be colder, while theother object will be warmer. The energythat the physicist refers to is electromag-netic in nature, of course. The averageacademic physicist of our days is still hos-LESSON IITel. 770 924 0223 www.hscti.com - e-mail: sales@hscti.com 11"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"Wilhelm Reich has also made an-other important observation: An electro-scope discharges much faster in an at-mosphere that has a high orgone poten-tial. This characteristic allowed Reich tomeasure the strength of fields of life en-ergy. If we consider this characteristic oflife force and the fact that the inside of anorgone box is warmer than its surround-ings, we must realize that there is an \"in-terface\" between the space time thatphysics describes and life energy.Wilhelm Reich was a medical doc-tor. Therefore he used orgone energy forhealing purposes. This brought tradition-alists on the plan with the usual conse-quences.Reich went on to use his discover-ies to build devices that he called \"cloudbusters.\" He used these devices to influ-ence the weather: by forming clouds andby destroying them.Reich also discovered a variation oforgone that was stagnant. He called thisenergy deadly orgone, or DOR. He usedcloud busters to remove clouds of DORthat are hostile to life.tile to the concept of life energy.Life force operates the oppositeway. If you bring an object with a highpotential of life force in contact with anobject that has a low potential, the objectwith the higher potential will draw fromthe object with the lower potential.The second observation thatWilhelm Reich made was the following:Organic matter attracts and holds orgoneenergy while metallic matter attracts andimmediately repels orgone. He designedhis orgone accumulators following thesetwo principles.An orgone accumulator is a boxthat has alternating layers of organic andmetallic materials. The outermost layeris organic while the innermost layer is me-tallic. As a consequence there will be aflow of orgone energy from the outsideof the orgone box to the inside. The lifeforce inside the accumulator will becomestronger and stronger. A thermometeron the inside of the orgone box showsconsistently a higher temperature. Thisfact contradicts the law of entropy. Ac-cording to the second law of thermody-namics the inside of the box should havethe same temperature as the outside.12 Tel. 770 924 0223 www.hscti.com - e-mail: sales@hscti.com"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"For nearly 40 years after Reich'spassing virtually nothing happened in thescience of orgone physics. Magicians suchas Israel Regardie realized that a knowl-edge of orgone physics is useful for thestudy of magic. He recommends the studyof Reich's works in the introduction to hismanual of the Golden Dawn system. Hehad the right insights, but, being a tradi-tionalist, he was incapable of acceptingthe consequences and freeing himselffrom the traditions he grew up in. Mostof the people that followed Reich remainedsatisfied in conducting cloud busting ex-periments and building orgone accumu-lators. They overlooked that Reich's ge-nius opened up a vast field of new tech-nologies.LIFE FORCE AND THE MINDAlthough magicians used life forcethroughout the millennia, they never be-came aware of the principle of negativeentropy.

From thisstructural transfer and the principle ofnegative entropy follow that we can di-rect life energy with our minds.At this point it becomes necessarythat we begin with some practice that in-volves life energy. We do this practicewith technological tools and with our minds.Practice #1: Hold both hands in frontof you, about one foot from your eyes.Do so with a neutral background such asa wall. Have the fingers of both handstouch each other. Now very slowly pullthe hands apart and see the \"strings\" thatare still connecting the fingers that sepa-rate from each other.

Point the wand toward the area of theforehead that is in the center between theeyes, one inch away.5. Try with any other area of your body.The feeling that you get is your in-dividual experience. Some persons feela tingling. Others feel a slight cool breeze.Most persons feel a gentle warmth. Whatyou feel depends very much on whatgroup of nerve endings respond first. Theperson who is kinetically oriented re-sponds with a feeling of a tingling orbreeze while the visually oriented personfeels warmth. What happens in this ex-periment is the following: Your life en-ergy field is stronger than the energy fieldof the wand. Therefore you draw life en-ergy from the wand. When this life en-ergy enters your body it stimulates thetactile nerve endings in your skin. Youexperience this stimulation of nerve end-ings as a feeling of warmth, a tingling, ora breeze.

Besides of the use ofthese words being blatant violations oftrademark laws, much of the equipment that isoffered has little to do with the generation oforgone energy, and the “orgonite formulas” arepoor, since I was very careful in not revealingmy formula, so there was nothing to stealbesides the most rudimentary and obviousingeredients. Naturally, the JU 99 CE, which isin the price range of the cheapest copy catdevices, has silver tubing, Voltage Regulator andother features that put it light years ahead ofthose poor imitations.

It is goodto divert (in your imagination) a bit of lifeenergy into your own body while you aredrawing and projecting. This way youget stronger in the process.HOW TO GENERATELIFE ENERGYMagicians build up energy toproject it. They did so with sacrifice,chanting, emotional build up in congre-gations or magical groups, walking incircles, sex magical practices, etc. In mostinstances they used energy that was avail-able and accumulated it up for release ina magical operation.Walking or dancing in circles andsex magical practices are other methodsto generate life energy.ANIMAL MAGNETISMFranz Anton Mesmer developed asystem of healing that involves the gen-erating of life energy. It is the system of\"magnetizing.\" He used the term \"mag-netizing\" because he has chosen the term\"animal magnetism\" for life energy. Thepractice of magnetizing is relativelysimple. One person lies down, with lightor (ideally) no clothing. The other per-son passes one or both hands over thebody of the person who is magnetized ata distance of one to two inches. Lead themagnetic strokes from the extremities tothe center of the body, i.e., the area ofthe navel: from head to center, from toesto center, from hands to center. Whenreturning to the back you do so in a widearch, sometimes shaking out the hands.Tel. 770 924 0223 www.hscti.com - e-mail: sales@hscti.com 17"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"If you do not visualize the energybeing sent to any part of the body, thenthe body will send the energy where it ismost needed.

If you havetwo wands available, use both wands.From Mesmers research and otherobservations follows another importantcharacteristic of life energy: You can gen-erate life energy by moving fields of lifeenergy relative to each other. This hap-pens clearly in the practice of magnetiz-ing, but also in group practices such aswalking or dancing in circles.THE ORGONE GENERATOR.On the basis of the previous ob-servation and characteristic of life energy,I invented the life energy generator, orWelz generator. The Welz generator hasthe advantage that it can run continuously.In addition, a set of Welz generators candevelop energies so powerful that nogroup of magicians can match!THE BASIC LAWS OF LIFE ENERGY:1. Distance is a result of structuraldifferences.2. We know of similar structures andequivalent structures.3. Life energy follows negative entropy.4. Life energy interacts with magne-tism.5. When you shift fields of life energyrelative to each other you generatelife energy.

Do other people envy you? Or doyou envy others? 2. Do other people want to be like you?Or do you wish you were living otherpeoples’ lives? 3. Are others in awe of you? Do theypuzzle at your meteoric rise to the top asmuch as they wonder about your success,accomplishments and amazingly goodfortune? Or is it perhaps the other wayaround?Here is a list of some of the good thingsthat you probably want: The things you want to own The money you want to acquire The things you like to achieve The exotic places you want to see The abilities you like to have Good fortune at all times The love you like to receive Abundance on all levels Achieve and maintain balance, harmonyand peace And much, much more...Now, in this course you are learning that it isyour Power that carries your decision, obeysyour command. This Power is a manifestationof the life force that you have available.Wise people in the Far East called this life force,or power, Chi and they developed manytechniques of self-improvement from thisknowledge such as Tai Chi and Chi Gong. ModernWestern terms for life force are orgone, animalmagnetism, Od, Solar ether, and others.To understand the advantage that this Power,i.e., life force, can give you, imagine thefollowing: Bring a native in from a remote jungleto a city. The electricity will not work for himuntil he realizes that this button turns on thatlight and that switch turns on this radio.Naturally, for him the effects of electricity are“magic”.

Heconsiders the tuner a solidified thoughtform and the rates representing agree-ments with the subtle nature spirits.I can agree with such an animisticapproach.

Still inour days most people have a concept of abearded gaseous mammal of the male sexwho \"made it all\" with \"his\" hands.At some point in human historynatural scientists began to develop mod-els that were less anthropomorphic onthe one hand and more useful on theother.

It needs to be a tribal soci-ety that has never heard about civiliza-tion as we know it. Among your equip-ment you have a cattle prodder thatcauses electric shocks. Since you knowsome of the religious beliefs of that soci-ety you make some image at the righttime (the sacred time of the year) and ina traditional shape. Then you connect thisimage with your cattle prodder. Chancesare that with such a contraption you canconvince these people of your divine na-ture or of your spiritual connection withtheir sky of gods. It all works because ofseveral reasons: First of all, those goodfolks have no idea of electricity, but theycertainly can feel the shocks. They maythink that the shock they get is the powerof their gods. Another important facetof your experience is that you adjustedto the existing belief structure. If you didnot do it, they would. That could be quiterisky since electric shocks are somewhatpainful and the connection with a demonicforce is easily imagined.As far as the feeling of life energyis concerned, most of America comparesto the jungles of New Guinea. Few peopleknow that life force exists. Still less knowthat they can feel life force. The majorityof people deny the very existence of lifeenergy. When selling my Orgone gen-erators I let people feel the energy. Thismade me realize that about 90% of thepeople feel life force whether they believein it or not. All of this is a fertile groundfor our cattle prodder experiment. All youneed to do is adjust somewhat to the ex-isting mainstream religion.I did the experiment in the follow-ing way. In a Christian book store I boughta cross that measured about 6 inches inlength (made in Communist China, ofcourse). I drilled a 1/4 inch hole from thetop to the center. Then I took a smalljewelry type crystal and broke it in two.One half of it I inserted into the hole. Istuffed some paper on top of it to hold itin place. Then I plugged the hole withwood filler. The other half of the crystal Iput inside an operating Welz generator.Now the cattle prodder was in operation.What I did next is having my Christianacquaintances feel it. I made a few com-mentaries about the power of their Godcoming from the cross. Most people feelthe life energy when they hold the palmof their hands about one inch above thecenter of the cross. When they feel thisenergy under the appropriate circum-stances, they are quite logically inducedto think that it truly is the power of theirGod that emanates from the cross.

A cattle prodder like this will sureprovide you with a lot of fun. Perhapsyou may even become inclined to orga-nize a church.Why does this cattle prodder work?The answer lies in the crystal. The twoparts of the crystal form an excellentstructural link. The obvious linkage arethe breaking surfaces that are very simi-lar. A second linkage may be the subtlestructure of the crystal itself: intricaciesof the crystal grid that are the samethroughout the original crystal. It is iden-tical in the two parts. From the previouslesson you know that the person whoholds the palm of the hand above the cen-ter of the cross willdraw life energy from the Welz generatorwhere the second half of the crystal servesas a structural link. The near identicalstructures of the two crystal parts makethe transfer from Welz generator to crosspossible. Instead of the crystal you maywork with a scribble or any other graphicdesign that you copy twice. Put one ofthe copies inside the cross and the othercopy into the Welz generator. Then havefun with your friendly neighborhood fun-damentalists! If this is not your idea ofhaving fun, please skip this practice! Aword to the Christian who might be of-fended about this: I suggest you tell yourpreachers not to make consistently funand brand as evil everything that I amdoing. At least I do not call their mumbojumbo evil. Just silly, infantile, and ut-terly primitive. If you succeed to stoptheir impudences, we have a deal!EQUIVALENT AND NEAR-IDENTICAL STRUCTURESIn the first lesson you have becomefamiliar with the idea of structural links.You learned it in this course:The fact that Magic andRadionics are perfectlyinterchangeable!A radionics device establishes non-fleeting andstable structural links. In this respect, theradionics device has a decisive advantage overthe human brain, which has the characteristicof “moving around”. Magical objects andmagical sigils are structural links of the samestability.Therefore, a radionics device can also be calleda “universal magical sigil”. It is a technologicaldevice that establishes structural links and holdsthese structures longer than our brain can do.The advantage of the radionics device over themagical or any other symbol is its infiniteflexibility! The seasoned magician alwaysprefers a combination of the two: themagical sigil to make use of energies thatpeople have used successfully over and overagain and the radionics device for the purposeof fine-tuning these energies and adjusting themto the specific purpose of the operation. Thisway they can tie into well-established energypatterns (the magical symbol), which theymodify for a specific purpose with the radionicsdevice. The Power RadionicsTM Programcombines the two in a most effective way!The most important factor required for thesuccess of a radionics operation is not thespecific make-up of the device that you use toestablish equivalent structural links; it is theamount of life force used for the operationand the sophistication and adaptability of theenvisioned trend energies, ideally as an“independently acting” thought form. Thisis the reason why the RAD 2400 HD is ideal foryour magical work.It is obvious by now that the radionics device isthe ideal tool to establish equivalent structurallinks that connect to any desired target, trend,or to both.The advantage of the radionics device over themethods of traditional magic, such as sigils,oils, dolls, etc., is the obvious fact of itsincredible flexibility.

We have realized that life en-ergy connects through equivalent or iden-tical structures and that it allows transferthrough the same type structure.In the following we work with thetwo concepts of identical and equivalentstructure, then we practice a few simpleexperiments. To get a practical \"feel\" forwhat we are telling you is more valuablethan a thousand words!It is easy for you to understand theconcept of an identical structure. We haveidentical structures in case #1 where ahair (ideally with follicle) connects withthe person, because the genetic code inthe cells of the hair is almost identical tothe genetic code in all other cells of theorganism from which the hair comes.Therefore life energy transfers from thehair to all other cells of the organism.Likewise we have an identical structure inthe case of practice #19. If we limitedourselves just to the concept of identicalor near identical structures, we would al-ready have a wealth of technologies atour disposal. However, experienceteaches us that this idea of structure takeson a much wider meaning. This is quiteobvious in the case of the charismaticchurch. The visualization of a personshows hardly any structural identity withthe person itself. It's an appearance thatour brain cells give us. This appearanceresults from memories. In some way wecan say that our memory allows a struc-tural linkage that involves the dimensionsof time. A similar thing happens in case#4, where the names are written down.It will be good now to go throughthe practices in lesson 2 to explain theworkings of life energy and how the ma-gician can use it. From an understandingof these practices we will then be able towork out new magical technologies.Practices #1 and #2: The structural trans-fer may be ignored. Life energy seemsto have a capability to stay connectedfor a while.Practice #3: Life energy flow followsmental commands. Later we will learnthat life energy may take on a shape thatyou \"tell it\" to take. In a strong field oflife energy you can photograph this shapewith any camera such as a Polaroid cam-era. You may expand the exercise bycommanding the energy bridge to forman arch rather than a straight line.The fact that you can mentally di-rect life energy is obvious in cases #4 and#6 of lesson #1. This capability is pos-sible because life energy transfers throughequivalent structural links. The near iden-tical structure is typically of the samematerial. The equivalent structure is ofother material. Clothing that is used insome magical operations to influencepeople represents a near identical struc-ture, because it contains skin rubbings ofthe person. A photo on the other hand isan equivalent structure. There are waysof making very effective equivalent struc-tures that are not as obvious as photos.Radionic rates are a good example. Soare specific sigils that you can create toconnect with a person or with a specificaction.Practices #5 through 14 are alltransfers by way of equivalent structures.Magicians use sometimes the word\"symbolic representation\" when talkingabout equivalent structure. With this theymean something that represents persons,groups, events, or specific magical ener-gies or entities.An old assumption of magicians isthe following: If you have the true nameof something (such as a spirit), then youhave control over it. As a consequenceof this hypothesis many magicians havedeveloped mantras of power, i.e., pho-netic expressions, that connect with spe-cific entities of with specific action.

A mantra, or \"true name,\" ofcourse, is an equivalent structure.Equivalent structures may vary de-pending on the circumstances, the cul-tural background, the magical system andthe specific symbolism or design systemused. The most frequent bases of equiva-lent structures are graphical outlines(sigils), sounds (mantras and, of recent,sound pitches), dance forms, special mix-tures of incenses, dolls, astrological chartrepresentations, radionics devices, andsymbolisms such as Runes and the Tarot.In this previous description of equivalentstructures we have recognized anotherimportant factor: The matrix of theequivalent structure. This matrix is anystructure (such as a set of symbols as inthe Tarot) that the magician may arrangeto establish a structural link. Many ofthese matrices are \"artificial\" ones. Thatmeans that humans established them ac-cording to their belief systems. Althoughsuch matrices are excellent, they are notan absolute need for magic at large.The zodiac is a good example for anatural matrix. Its settings (planetarypositions) at a specific time determine thecharacteristics of a human being that isborn under these settings. In a moregeneralized effect, astrological positionsestablish a field of connections with ener-gies of a higher order. This energy fieldestablishes the trends that influence theaction of everything in its realm. We willcome back to this later and we will showhow we can generate our own astrologi-cal trends with relative ease, especiallywhen we use a Welz generator for thispurpose.The connection of equivalent struc-tures with the target or with an energy ofa higher order (spirit, entity, etc.) resultssometimes in part from the functioningof our brains. This is especially true whenwe use letters of the alphabet or num-bers as elements of such an equivalentstructure. Our mind recognizes someobject as a general matrix for an equiva-lent structure (a \"universe\") and then es-tablishes the specific setting of the ma-trix that ensures contact with the target.From a technological point of view,we have available a wide spectrum ofequivalent structures that range from purevisualization or imagining (mental images)over the making of sigils, the use of natu-ral structural links such as incenses, oilsand herbs, all the way to the near identi-cal structural links.The radionic device is an excellentexample of a system of equivalent struc-tures that are totally arbitrary. But thenagain some of the symbolisms, alphabets,sound systems, etc., are arbitrary basesas well.It seems that if, with our minds,we decide that something represents theuniverse - or that we declare somethingas symbolizing the universe (or the total-ity of our environment), then we can de-vise partial systems of it that representthe elements of this universe.For instance if we decide that theradionic box represents the human body,then we can determine a system of set-tings (the radionics term for setting is rate)that represent the various parts and subsystems of the body.Equivalent structures are the resultof conventions. The capability of ourminds to generate psychic linkage maybe at the root of the functioning of equiva-lent structures. On the other hand wecan get a good linkage with a near identi-cal structure (such as a hair) and thendevelop a system of equivalent structures(rates) for the body from which the hairis coming and its specific systems. If wedo not have the linkage of the hair, thenthe setting for the liver may also bring inzodiacal energies that correlate to theliver (Jupiter energies in this case).Tel. 770 924 0223 www.hscti.com - e-mail: sales@hscti.com 25"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"DISTANCE IS THE RESULT OFSTRUCTURAL DIFFERENCESWhen we say that distance is a re-sult of structural differences we need toinclude both, similar and equivalent struc-tures. The more similar the structure, thecloser are the objects as far as the trans-fer of life energy is concerned.The living being establishes dis-tance by means of its shifting structurallinkages. Therefore the living being prac-tices magic at all times.From the structural concepts thatwe have established above follows thatcloseness is not only within the three di-mensional space that we see and in whichwe move. Quite often we are too involvedwith this habitual concept of space whilecompletely ignoring the \"magical close-ness\" that life energy opens up for us.We may only become painfully aware ofthe powerful consequences of such \"close-ness from outside our three dimensionalspace\" at times when we are the victimof a spell that someone has cast fromthousands of miles away. Even then weare more inclined to think in terms of the\"miraculous\" rather than accepting the ob-vious. This compares to the zoologist whoadmires the \"capability of a butterfly tosmell a female that is several miles awayand to find his way there.\" To smell meansto pick up traces of chemicals. Directionalsmelling is even more difficult, especiallywhen there is nothing to smell!

The best way togain an understanding of structural linksis practical experience through experi-mentation. This experimentation will alsohelp us expand our concepts of structurallinks. A thorough examination of ancientprinciples of magic will help us gain anexpansion of our concepts of space. Thevisual space is the space that provides uswith our immediate needs and interaction:food, clothing, relations, etc. The life en-ergy space provides us with an easing ofour immediate needs and an expansionof our communicative abilities by meansof magical action that employs life energy.It is magical action upon an environmentof which we created a new and more use-ful map. Now let's go on to experimentwith structural links. For our experimentswe need the following:1. Two identical structures. We may makea simple drawing or scribble.

Thismeans, in other words: The flow of lifeenergies follows similar structures. Inpractical application: If you have twoidentical designs, chi (life energy) can flowbetween the two designs.2. If you take an object that was part ofa person such as hair, you can establish abridge of energy with that person. This isso because the genetic code that you findin a hair cell is identical to the geneticcode of all other cells of the body of thatperson. The use of hair, fingernails, blood,or similar things resulted from experience.3. We can direct life energy with our mind.This is so because our mind can generatestructures. If we visualize a person towhom we send life energy, we generatein our mind a structure that's similar tothat person. This structure connects withthe target person and a flow of energy tothat person becomes possible.4. Equivalent Structures: Equivalentstructures are not near identical. Theyresult from determining a well-specifiedframe of reference as a \"universe\" for aspecific set of effects, energies, or indi-viduals. Individual settings of this frameof reference determine to what event,effect, energy, or individual, the nowmodified frame of reference connects.5. Equivalent Structures in Nature: Na-ture gives us a wide variety of examplesof what we call equivalent structures. Ineach of these cases you can use one sys-tem to determine characteristics of theother. The way to determine these char-acteristics is the result of research intothe specifics of the equivalent structure,statistical comparison, and developmentof models that make translation possible.Good examples are iridology (for diagno-sis and to tell about characteristics of theperson, even to foretell future trends),foot- and hand reflexology, ear acupunc-ture, and astrology. In the latter the zo-diac and heavenly bodies take the aspectof a large radionics device. The astro-logical zodiac is a naturally occurring frameof reference. It compares to a huge radi-onics box that connects with everythingon this planet. We can not set the \"dials\"of our planetary system, but we haveother ways of using this radionics deviceof cosmic proportions. We can calculatein advance the positions of the elementsof this radionics box, the planets. Thenwe can determine the kinds of zodiacalenergies that connect with any given in-dividual at any given time. After we de-termined the nature of the zodiacal ener-gies we can interpret them as trends thatare valid for the individual.6. Artificial Equivalent Structures: Thereare several symbolisms and devices thathumans have developed to be equivalentstructures. Whenever our mind deter-mines something to reflect a \"universe,\"i.e., a system that we perceive as closedsuch as a human being, we can use it asa symbolism that we can use to repre-sent equivalent structures. In such casesthe map becomes a structural link to theterritory it has the potential to describe.The tree of life is one such device. Otherframes of reference are symbolisms of anykind, notably alphabets, Enochian tablets,and mythologies. The radionic device isa more recent developmentof a frame of reference that allows theestablishing of equivalent structures.

Gamma frequencies are above 30Hz.This method of controlling brain waves withlow frequency input is not new at all! In the1930’s researchers found that repetitive lightand/or sound stimulation caused brain wavesto adjust to the same frequency.

These map-pings relate to actual structures in our uni-verse. When we use the word universewe mean much more than what the aca-demic physicist think the universe is. Wemean something that reaches beyond theuniverse of time-space. The universe thatwe talk about includes realm of action oflife energies (hyper spaces), the realmsthat represent specific actions, or trends,and the realms of creative energies. Inbrief, this universe connects that which is\"material\" in the meaning of classicalphysics and that which is \"magical.\" Themodels that we establish of these realmsare very flexible. The fact that we cansucceed with establishing a near compre-hensive model of these realms for ourpurposes does not mean that we wouldnot have an infinite number of other waysto model the same reality, or universe.In the previous lessons I have re-ferred to energies of a higher order(HOE's) several times. When I say HOE,I mean with it any action or trend thatoperates beyond the realms of electro-magnetic energy and life energy. In ourpractical work with many models thatdescribe these energies we found that theastrological model is one of the most use-ful mappings of these energies. This isso because the astrological model reflectsa cosmic structure after which life on thisplanet is fashioned.When working with HOE's, it is alsogood that you come to some understand-ing of the zero point energy. This is therealm of what some metaphysicists call\"chaos.\" The zero is not a nothing but itis a balance of forces that results in zero.Some researchers use the term\"tachyonic\" when they refer to chaos. Ifyou \"disturb\" that balance then you \"cre-ate\" something. The interpretation of sev-eral phenomena makes this mapping ofchaos a very useful one.Energies of a higher order (HOE's)have specific characteristics that pertainto what metaphysicists call \"higherplanes.\" We can see and measure theireffects. Many of these energies have acharacteristic to personify. By this wemean that these energies can appear tous as persons. This characteristic has todo with our own structure. Personifica-tion of HOE's, therefore, has a subjectivevalue that encompasses all of mankind.Because of this characteristic to personify,magicians of old times spoke of spirits,gods, and the like when referring to HOE's.This animistic approach has many advan-tages. Above all you can create mytho-logical systems that talk about interac-tion of gods, adventures of god-like he-roes and the like in order to speak of psy-chological processes and other things thatare abstract. The mapping that followsis in close leaning to the ancient gods ofthe zodiac and to the classical \"four ele-ments.\" It is a description, or mapping,of the higher planes that has proven tobe very useful. I suggest that you ex-plore the realms that I am going to de-scribe and that you develop your prac-tices in using these energies. A good wayto explore these energies is to astrallytravel in their realms.

This framework allows us toaccess any type of HOE we want to ac-cess. The model that we are about todescribe is useful and comprehensive. Butagain I need to point out that we canmake an infinite amount of other modelsthat are equally valid.Before I am going to describe thefour planes I give you a brief descriptionof the four elements. As you know, themetaphysical elements have little to dowith the chemical elements. These ele-ments are basic qualities rather than ba-sic substances as the chemical elementsare. The basic qualities of the metaphysi-cal elements relate to our sensory expe-rience and they are a projection of thissensory experience into the realms of finerdensity. Once we experience these realmsof finer density, we are aware that theconcepts of elements are generalizationsthat are convenient for our work.The four sensory experiences thatare at the root of the concept of the fourelements are: hot and cold, dry and hu-mid. The pair, hot and cold, we refer toas positive and negative. Dry and Humidwe refer to as electric and magnetic. It isvery important that you learn the tablebelow:Fire and Water are the two primaryelements, opposite polarities, so to say.Air and Earth are considered to be sec-ondary, or mixtures of the first two. Thisis a manner of viewing it.Some researchers see air as an in-teraction between the two basic principlesof fire and water. They consider earth tobe the synthesis of the three. The sym-bolism of Divine trinities \"above\" theworlds of manifestation somewhat re-flects this view. You find this symbolismin many pagan religions as well as in theChristian religion which is in principle apaganized Jewish religion.Electric and Magnetic relate to thephenomena of electromagnetic energyand life energy. The fire element is elec-tric-positive. On the material plane it isenergy, or light, in its conventional mean-ing. The earth element is electric-nega-tive. It is structured light, or \"frozen light\"as some researchers say. Modern phys-ics somewhat supports this theory.The air element is magnetic-posi-tive. On the material plane it is active lifeenergy, or free life energy. The water el-ement is magnetic-negative, or structuredlife.34 Tel. 770 924 0223 www.hscti.com - e-mail: sales@hscti.com"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"Water - condensed life energy - struc-tured orgone (prana, chi) - cold and hu-mid - negative magneticFire - volatile light - etheric electromag-netism - hot and dry - positive electricEarth - dense (\"frozen\") light - struc-tured electromagnetism - cold and dry- negative electricAir - volatile life energy - etheric orgone(prana, chi) - hot and humid - positivemagneticIf we relate the four elements tothe material plane, we can easily orderthe four elements. Earth and Water be-long to the dense material plane while airand fire are part of the etheric plane. Thelabels \"positive\" and \"negative\" are ref-erences to density. The elemental refer-ences as being \"fire, air,\" etc., are pic-tures to make us understand easier thebasic qualities. The references to elec-tromagnetism and life energy, dense(structured) and volatile (etheric, non-structured) conform more with the reali-ties of modern physics and magic of thefuture than would do the partition intofive elements that includes the \"akashaelement\" in leaning on Hindu philosophy.The four elements are a good represen-tation of the physical realities of light en-ergy (electromagnetic energy) and life en-ergy.Let's repeat here:The four elements supply us withan excellent model for the planes of ex-istence and in correlation with it planes ofexperience within ourselves. The earthelement refers to that which is conscious,or the material planes. The water ele-ment refers to the human emotions andto the astral plane. The air element re-fers to the human mind and the mentalplane, while the fire element refers to thehuman will and the causal plane.Magicians see some \"entities\" orenergies of a higher order that correlateto the four elements. These traditionalelementals are the salamanders for thefire element, the sylphs are spirits of theair element, the undines are spirits of thewater element, and the gnomes are spir-its of the earth element.Tel. 770 924 0223 www.hscti.com - e-mail: sales@hscti.com 35"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"In a technological sense we mayview spirits as energies of a higher orderthat are made to manifest (personify) inthe etheric plane.In the following I am giving you aset of correlations for each element.These correlations will suffice for ourpresent work.THE PLANESThe planes of existence correlatewith the elements. You must familiarizeyourself well with this model in order towork toward consciousness of One withthe techniques that I am showing you inthe course of cosmic consciousness. Youmay perceive these planes as \"higher\"planes or as \"inner\" planes. As youprogress with your work you will get tounderstand that this distinction between\"higher\" and \"inner\" has only limited rel-evance. Oneness with the Divine will ul-timately elevate you into realms where adistinction between \"inner\" and \"higher\"become meaningless.THE MATERIAL PLANEThe material plane is the planewhere you find all that is tangible andwhere you find these things that you be-come conscious of. Each one of the higherplanes has a material component whichis the realm where it can become con-scious to you.For convenience we subdivide thematerial plane into two levels: the ethericplane and the dense material plane. Theetheric plane is the plane that containsfree chi and free light energy. The densematerial plane is the realm that is struc-tured.Although we make such a distinc-tion, there is no sharp border betweenthe two planes, but a continuous transi-tion. Free chi and free light are only atthe threshold of chaos. The more mani-fest these energies become the denserare their appearances. Also, there is noth-ing that is purely chi and there is nothingthat is purely light, there is nothing thatis totally dense and there is nothing thatis totally unstructured. The labels thatwe use are describing extremes that arebeyond our existence. It is the mixtureof the elements that make things exist-ing while the pure element by itself can-not have any existence. The materialplane is far more complex than the space-time continuum that modern physics at-tempts to describe. Life energy does notfollow the laws of the three dimensionaluniverse that we measure, but it has itsown type of \"space.\" The main charac-teristic of that space is structural linkage.THE ASTRAL PLANEThe astral plane contains matricesof that which is tangible, or material. Itis the world of formation. The energiesof the astral plane are of a more subtlenature than the energies of the ethericand material planes. It is a world of de-sire, of emotions. A spirit that has thedesire to manifest dwells in the astral. Forits manifestation a material focus is nec-essary. A human being can direct a spiritto gain an etheric form. If a magiciandoes that consciously we call it an evoca-tion of the spirit. I have evoked spiritsand furnished them with sufficient life en-ergy (with the Welz Chi Generator that Iinvented) so that they could show theirform on Polaroid photos.We can also project part of our en-ergy field into the astral world and travelthere. This way we can gain contact withentities without them needing to materi-alize in an evocative process.

These energies arestill more subtle than the astral energies.They relate to the human mind. Anothername for the mental planes is world ofcreation.

Manifestationitself you find in the material plane, whiletrends are part of the planes that are be-yond the material one. The causal planesets an idea in motion, the mental planegives it its shape, the astral plane desire,and the material plane allows manifesta-tion. When we send magical action ortrends to a target we use energies of ahigher order (not manifested energies thatare part of the astral and mental planes)and cause them to manifest at the tar-get.AN ASTROLOGICAL MAPOF THE UNIVERSEThat there is a correlation betweenastrological positions and trends on ourplanet has been established long ago.From empirical observations of ancientmagicians gradually a science evolved thatcorrelates the destiny and general trendsof every individual on this planet with theposition of the stars at this individual'sbirth. More specific trends that are validfor an individual can be found in an analy-sis of the movements of the planets andstars after its birth. The position of theheavenly bodies in relation to a locationcompares well to the setting of a radion-ics device.A closer analysis of the planets,stars, etc., in the sky and their move-ments yields some very interesting re-sults: they follow interesting numericalcorrelations. Bode's law expresses thesecorrelations.Although astrologyhas served mankind well,most astrologers were ata loss when they tried toexplain why the wholething worked. The oldassumption that theheavenly bodies weregods was somewhatvalid.38 Tel. 770 924 0223 www.hscti.com - e-mail: sales@hscti.com"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"It even helped develop magical systemsthat had the goal of establishing trendsother than what the stars promised byplacating these gods.This animistic approach camecloser to the reality of astrological ener-gies being HOE's than the ludicrous as-trological theories of our days. The lackof true scientific training of most modernday astrologers finds its expression in thetheories that they formulate. While theanimistic approach of the astrologers ofancient times gave at least rise to a tech-nology of generating trends, the pop-sci-entific approach of their modern daycounterparts brings nothing of that kind.Astrology has totally degenerated into ascience that just interprets trends. Mod-ern astrologers are nothing but a bunchof counselors who have the advantageof being capable of predicting futuretrends.Perhaps the best explanation ofwhy astrology works is the structural ap-proach. With this we mean that the plan-etary system acts like a large radionicsdevice. The nice thing about this radion-ics device of cosmic proportions is thatthe positions of its \"dials\" can be calcu-lated in advance. This allows us to deter-mine astrological trends in advance.We can observe a specific functionof a biological, physiological, psychologi-cal, etc., nature in connection with eachplanet. Furthermore, the position of aplanet within the zodiac modifies its func-tion and the distances of each planet toany other (aspects) will increase or de-crease the interaction of their respectivefunctions.I suggest that you get a good in-troduction into astrology to know the func-tion of the planets and the zodiacal signs.In the following I am going to elaboratethe connection of the solar system to thecabalistic system. From there we aregoing on to an approach that decribes avast amount of specific entities (HOE's)that connect with the astrological sys-tem. Such an approach you find in FranzBardon's book \"The practice of magicalevocation.\" Each entity that Bardon men-tions in his book has a specific sphere ofinfluence. To use this entity you need tolink up with it by means of its sigil. Thenyou can connect it with the psychic link ofyour target.There is a great advantage toknowing that the planetary system actsupon us like a large radionics device. Wecan develop equivalent structures to theHOE's of the zodiacal factors. When weenergize these HOE's with life energy, wecreate our own trends. This gives us backthe power of the wise of ancient timeswho ruled the stars. The fact that ourapproach is not animistic gives us theadded advantage of much greater flex-ibility.THE MAGICAL SQUARESOF THE PLANETSThe planetary energies are an ex-cellent system that we can use to estab-lish trends. If the astrological systemdetermines trends that are in effect forindividuals, groups, and events, then thefollowing lends itself to us: We can struc-turally connect with the factors that aredetermining the astrological trends andgenerate our own trends. This comparesto establishing a greenhouse of astrologi-cal energies which we can then use at ourliking.Structural connections with plan-etary energies are ancient knowledge.Tel. 770 924 0223 www.hscti.com - e-mail: sales@hscti.com 39"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"One of the best ways to draw planetaryenergies are the magical squares of theplanets.

The classificationinto \"natural\" and \"artificial\" is somewhatarbitrary. Most artificial systems ofequivalent structures have a natural ba-sis.The fact that equivalent structureswork gives rise to many magical meth-ods. When we think of structure, we usu-ally think of a graphic outline. We disre-gard the fact that there are many morepossibilities of structural linkage than al-phabets and graphical sigils. We can useshapes in any sensory experience asequivalent structures. In the following youwill see a list of equivalent structures,natural and artificial ones, that haveproven to be useful for the establishing ofstructural links to persons (targets) andspecific energies (trends). It will be goodif you get acquainted with some of them.METHODS TO EXPRESS ANDESTABLISH EQUIVALENTSTRUCTURES1. The Word (prayers, psalms, man-tras, etc.)Here you find words of power, sa-cred mantras, mantras that you establishwith the radionics device, so-called bar-barisms or formulas that you can use tocall entities, the names of entities,prayers, psalms, chants, cryptic \"lan-guages,\" etc. Note: Many of these itemsare \"channeled\" or received in evocativeprocesses. Consequently they invariablybear the mark of the language in whichthey originated. Examples: The entitiesof Franz Bardon's system are pronouncedin German. The Enochian language hasentirely English sound structure and gram-mar all through.

This however doesnot impair the effectiveness of the sys-tem!2. DesignIn this category fall all symbols thatwe establish to connect with entities(HOE's). Some of these graphic symbolsseem freely invented while others followspecific principles of design. In most in-stances an entity has a name and a sigil.Often the sigil is a graphic representationof the name following some kind of de-sign that is based on the letters with whichthe name is written.3. Things in the EnvironmentIn this category fall objects that youcan find in the environment. \"Spirit\" toldancient magicians, or shamans, whichherbs can do what. There are powers thatare attributed to gems, animals, trees, lo-cations, etc., that connect with zodiacalsigns and planets, trees that are sacredto specific gods, and much more. Stud-ies in folklore, herbalism, and older as-trology and magic books are a rich sourceof these correlations.4. Body Postures, dances, hand po-sitions, etc.Body postures, hand positions, anddancing are excellent methods to serveas structural links for specific energies.5. The MindHere you have visualizations of theentities, colors, imagination of the pres-ence of entities, specific feelings, etc.6. ParaphernaliaParaphernalia are man made ob-jects that serve as structural links repre-senting specific energies, entities, per-sons, or situations. Repeated use of amagical utensil attaches energies of ahigher order to it that you then need nolonger evoke in a magical practice. Con-sequently you can use energies for thingsother than routine.7. Technological DevicesThese are man made objects thatare of use to establish structural links.Their characteristic is flexibility and thepossibility to arbitrary settings to estab-lish any structural link the magicianchooses. The designs and look of thesedevices depends on fashion. A typicalexample is a radionics device. Anothergood example is an altar that you mayset up to connect with any specific targetand energy (spell) of your choice.8. Logical Concepts (numbers, alpha-bets, etc.)Whenever human beings start touse numbers and letters they assign tothem magical meaning. The magical al-phabets and the symbolism of numerol-ogy are good examples.SETS OF EQUIVALENTSTRUCTURESThe human characteristic to ab-stract, to order and to generalize led tothe establishment of magical hierarchies.Good examples are the many my-Tel. 770 924 0223 www.hscti.com - e-mail: sales@hscti.com 43"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"thologies. Each god has a specific func-tion. The god may be contacted withspecific dances, sigils, colors, ceremonials,etc., then the god will do the bidding ofthe magician. Medieval grimoires are con-densed mythologies that have had thepurpose to provide the magician withthose things that the magical practicesof organized religion could not deliver.Each one of the entities in such a grimoirehas its symbol and often a set of barbar-isms (sounds that are not language) tocall them.In more advanced cultures the my-thologies connect with the astrologicalSuch sets of equivalent structuresusually relate to many different methodsto establish the specific structures as de-scribed above. Of a god you have a sigil,a name, a mantra to chant, a color, ametal, a planet, a letter, etc.A good magical hierarchy is all en-compassing. By this we mean that a goodmagical hierarchy should have the flex-ibility to connect with any trend that weintend to generate. The elements thatwe may read into the cosmic radionic de-vice (the astrological zodiac) represent anatural hierarchy. The ten Sephiroth ofthe tree of life represent a system of ab-system. In this case happened a shift ofcorrelations: from correlating with natu-ral phenomena in the direct environmentsthe gods shifted into correlating with thepowers of the planets that generatetrends.Another development is the estab-lishing of alphabets. Each of the letters isassigned a specific meaning. Primitivelogic plus tuning into metaphysical realitybrought forth several sets of equivalentstructures that we can regard as beingtrue symbolisms. In these sets the posi-tion of each of its elements in relation toall other elements is of crucial significance.In all cases where such an alphabetic setconnects with the astrological system wefind a basis for a true symbolism.stractions that have a similar flexibility.The Eighteen Sacred Futhork Runes thatconnect with the periodic system of ele-ments relate to a system of creative en-ergies. Most religious and mythologicalsystems fulfill these criteria. It has provento be an advantage on magical work whenthe sets of equivalent structures of a magi-cal system correlate with basic human ex-periences. These are patterns of sensoryexperience, established methods of think-ing and communicating such as spokenlanguage and body language, psychologi-cal structures, socially established pat-terns of interaction within groups and withthe environment, primary abstractions,etc.44 Tel. 770 924 0223 www.hscti.com - e-mail: sales@hscti.com"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"CONCLUSION:For the magician of the future it isimportant to choose a valid set of a magi-cal hierarchy.

Its precision of 1/100,000 isunsurpassed.Advantages of the EPM 2400: The “Input EPU”jack on the heavy duty devices (the RAD 2400HD and LPOG 2400 HD) leads to a secondgenerator in the Heavy Duty orgone generatingunits. This second generator can be poweredup with a pulse input from the EPM 2400.When having both generators running, you canmore than double the power output of yourheavy duty device.The advantages of this exact frequencygenerator are obvious: With it you can nowset your generator output at any frequencythat you desire, any frequency that bestreflects your needs.This exterior precision pulse module has beendesigned to meet the requirements of personswho desire to set any frequency of their choicewith absolute precision, stability, and reliability.This exact frequency requirement is desirablefor specific purposes such as performanceenhancement in sports, or when you work witha radionics system that is based on actualfrequency settings. Therefore, you can use it inconjunction with a stick pad, pendulum or otherdevice to determine frequencies that work verymuch like radionics rates. This way you caneither set up a system of exact frequencies thatreflect specific trends or you can use a bookthat gives you a list of these frequencies.The radionics qualities of this extraordinarydevice allow you to get a frequency rate eitherby rubbing a stick pad, then, when you feel the“stick”, by pushing the “random” button, or byreleasing the other buttons to set frequencieswhenever you feel the stick.Tel. 770 924 0223 www.hscti.com - e-mail: sales@hscti.com45"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"PROTECTION IN THE WORKWITH ENERGIESIn the previous lessons you havelearned the scientific basis of magical tech-nology. What you learned concerns in themain the principles of directing trends, oraction, at any target, be it far away ornot. These principles are life energy andstructural links. In lesson four I haveshown you the basics of energies of ahigher order and of magical hierarchies inwhich these energies are ordered. I havealso pointed out how to establish struc-tural links with elements (\"spirits\") ofthese magical hierarchies.The term \"spirit\" evolved becausemost of these energies of a higher ordercan personify and as such interact withthe practicing magician. If the magicianproceeds to give the energy sufficientetheric matter (life energy) then the en-ergy of a higher order manifests as anentity that the magician can perceive andeven photograph. To call in a spirit meansthen to condense a specific trend to theextent that it manifests. Such an entityhas its own way of action and the magi-cian needsto learn methods of controlling them. Thiscompares well to the control of energieson the material plane such as electricityand life energies. Here too the technicianhas to follow certain rules in order to keepfrom being hurt. The control of energiesof finer densities has to be within theirrealms: on the astral and mental planes.If the magician lacks the skill of properprotection and control, the success of themagical operation may be in question. Ifthe spirit is well defined and the energyfield of manifestation relatively weak thereis no big need for protective measures.In such a case however the desired ef-fect will come relatively slowly.LESSON VProtective measures and controlmeasures have to be set in motion in theplanes where the energies are active.Magicians of the past called this processthe process of establishing authority overthe spirit world. They devised severalmethods for establishing authority. Thesemethods included personal training as wellas the use of structural links that repre-sent energies that control the spirits. Asimple practice of burning incense can es-tablish a structural link to protective mea-sures.In the following I am guiding youthrough several protective measures.Practice #38: Establishing a Circle of Pro-tectionPractice #38A: Exploring the evocativemeaning of a symbolDo the following exercise: Lay outa circle of about 5 to 7ft diameter on thefloor. You may draw the circle with a pieceof chalk or simply use a rope that you laydown in the shape of a circle. Then blankyour mind, if you can do this, and look(without interference of thoughts, orwords) at this circle that you lay out onthe floor. Now notice the impressionsthat you get. Perhaps write them down.Your next step is to enter the circle.First sit down in the center of the circle.Again blank your mind and take notes.Then stand up. Slowly turn around untilyou are back to your original position.Carefully note your impressions.What you have done is an attemptto tune into the meaning of symbols with-out interference of thought that wouldassign a meaning logically. This was anexercise in primary abstraction in whichyou get sensory meaning before wordscome in. This is a very basic experience46 Tel. 770 924 0223 www.hscti.com - e-mail: sales@hscti.com"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"of living beings. From feelings that youget this way you can derive powerfulmethods in magic, because such experi-ence touches on levels that are not easilyaccessible to conscious thought, but nev-ertheless very active in human life.Metaphysicists say that the circlerefers to the universe, to completeness,and to protection. If you did your previ-ous exercise right, you have noticed thatthere other significances to the circle:significances of a magical nature that youcannot easily express with words, butwhich nevertheless are very real. Withthe previous exercise you have begun totouch the realms of creation.As a conclusion we can say the fol-lowing: When we work with a symbol,the first that comes into our minds is alogical interpretation of the symbol. Inthe case of a circle this is enclosure, pro-tection, a whole system, the universe, etc.The second meaning of the symbol is ex-perience that you can derive as a resultof primary abstraction. Primary abstrac-tion is abstraction that works with thesensory apparatur without the interfer-ence of words. The second set of mean-ings of the circle is of an evocative na-ture.You may do the practice that I de-scribed above with any other symbol. Anideal set of symbols for that purpose arethe Eighteen Sacred Futhork Runes. ThisRunic system is a symbolism that is mainlyevocative. The energies of these sym-bols touch on the creative levels. There-fore they have a minimum of definitions.Practice #38B: Setting up a Circle of Pro-tectionLay out your circle on the floor. Nowyou do the following: While projectinglife energy into the rope you build a wallof life energy that has the rope as a base.Feel the wall or have your partner feel it.Now you shape the wall into a bubble thatextends also beneath the circle. Feel thewall from the inside and from the out-side.This an exercise only. Consideringthe fact that life energy transmits throughhyperspaces a wall of life energy in threedimensional space is totally ineffective.However it is the concept of protectionthat the drawing of circles and the erec-tion of walls signify. Based on this ex-tended concept you are capable of ex-panding the effect of the sphere into serv-ing as a protection. The actual protectionbecomes a sphere that extends into hy-perspace and that cuts off any life energybased transmission. Most humans areincapable of actually visualizing hyper-spaces. However, use of the sphere orcircle as a symbol gives sufficient protec-tion in most cases.You may have heard of lots ofmethods of how to structure protectivespheres. These methods cover a widerange including white light, mirror sys-tems, and other new-agey pop-scientificmathematical concepts. A skilled hyper-space mathematician will penetrate anyand all of these shields with no problemat all. However it is useful to begin some-where. The circle of protection that youhave set up just now is a good protectionfor the work with most energies. This isTel. 770 924 0223 www.hscti.com - e-mail: sales@hscti.com 47"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"so because the concept of the circle car-ries a lot of evocative meaning. There-fore I stressed the preliminary exerciseof exploring the evocative dimension ofthe circle. Repeat this exercise again, thistime with your experiences with thebubble, or sphere, in mind. Then set upa new bubble.A circle represents also emptiness.The interior of the three dimensionalsphere in which you stand does not allowmaterial manifestation of entities. It's asphere of exclusion. Manifesting entitieshave to be outside this sphere. To bemore thorough you may need to extendthe sphere into additional spatial dimen-sions. This would add distance to theprotection.Practice #39: Confining the energy intoa triangle or mirrorIn the previous practice you havelearned to keep an energy out of some-thing. One of the functions of an emptycircle is the removal of any material pointwhere an energy could manifest. Thepractice that we are describing here hasthe opposite goal. It is the creation of anatmosphere that makes it easy for anenergy of a higher order to manifest. Thispractice is also helping to confine the en-ergy inside a well defined realm. Oncethe energy is made to manifest and wellconfined you have a reservoir from whichyou can project the energy at any target.While the circle represents emptiness, thetriangle allows manifestation. A trianglethat you extend into space naturally be-comes a tetrahedron, or three sided pyra-mid with a base. This is an excellent rep-resentation of structure in a three dimen-sional space.Practice #39A: Build a Triangle.As in practice #38A, determine thethree corners of the triangle. Then projectlife energy to form a pyramid above thetriangle. Next you project life energy in-side the pyramid. Use the drawing andprojecting method that you learned in les-son #2 or use a Welz Generator. TheWelz Generator works best if you havealready put a charge inside the trianglebefore you switch it on.

It is goodto have the mirror positioned inside a tri-angle.Both practices, the circle and thetriangle, are an excellent help in the workwith energies of a higher order. The circleremoves the potential of manifestation forthe energy. It is an insulating device forthe practicing magician. The triangle gen-erates a strong field of life energy thathelps confining the energy within its lim-its. The geometric shapes that we usefor our visualization are very helpful, butthey are of secondary importance in ourwork. If you become rooted in conceptsof hyper space mathematics you needno longer these symbols of circle and tri-angle. For the time being it is imperativethat you learn these practices.SUMMONING ANDCONTROLING ENERGIESOF A HIGHER ORDERNow that you have learned meth-ods of protection and methods to estab-lish an etheric base for the manifestationof HOE's where you may contain them fora while, it is time that you learn to drawand to control these energies. Drawingthe energy is easy. You draw the energyfor a specific purpose. This purpose maybe simple exploration of its capabilities orit may be actual use of the energy inmagical work. In either case you need tolearn how to control the energy and howto dispel it.You can always dispel an energy byremoving the life energy from the triangleby visual grounding. You can do so byshaping a circle (sphere) around the tri-angle and imagining the life energy draininto the energetic ocean of the universe.It is more useful to interact with the en-ergy and ask it to leave. In these cases itis easier for you to keep the energy oncall for future uses.Practice #40: Summoning, Controlling,and DispellingIn the following you learn a simplemethod to draw, control, and finally dis-pel an energy of a higher order.Practice $40A: Summoning of a HOEI have devisedthe following practicesin a way that theywould be safe even ifyou had no barrier atall.Set up your circle. Then set up yourtriangle. Draw the shape of a triangle ona circular table. You may also use somerope and lay it on the table in the shapepf a triangle. The circular table is veryuseful because it gives you an added bar-rier.Now you put a mirror inside the tri-angle. A small mirror that stands up isfine. You may use a frame for photosand spray paint the glass with black paint.Black instead of silver coating is helpful inwhat we are going to do. I have workedperfectly well with the ordinary silver mir-ror. Put two candles on the sides of themirror.Now put the sigil of an entity in frontof the mirror. For our example use thesymbol of a genius from the sphere ofVenus that you find in Franz Bardon's book\"The Practice of Magical Evocation.\" Thename of that entity is Owina. You canorder this book from HSCTI. It is an ex-cellent work that introduces you to prac-tical evocative methods. You find the sigilin the appendix of this course. Draw thissigil in green color. Green is the colorthat relates to the sphere of Venus.Project life energy into the triangle. Imag-ine this life energy being of green color.This way you give the field of life energyan aspect of Venus. The green color helpsthe manifestation of energies of Venus.You can aid the projection of life energyTel. 770 924 0223 www.hscti.com - e-mail: sales@hscti.com 49"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"with a Welz Generator. Once the triangleis filled with life energy you may call theenergy by its name while focusing on itssigil. This way you establish the struc-tural link with the HOE in the astral. Youcan either see a shift of life energy insidethe triangle or you may feel the presenceof the entity by a sudden rush ofgoosebumps.Now you may begin to look into themirror. Look at your face and see howits features change. Blank your mind dur-ing this practice and wait for any impres-sions that you may get. These impres-sions may be visions, thoughts, assur-ances, etc.If you have built up the field of lifeenergy with a Welz generator you maymake a photo of the table. Chances arethat the energy appears on film. When Imake photos of this kind the energy takessome kind of shape or it appears as alight.Practice #40B: Controlling the HOEControl of the HOE is relativelysimple once you have established yourauthority over the energy. There aremany ways to establish authority. Oneof the most useful ways of establishingauthority over entities is being aware ofyour Divine nature. You can do this byaligning the elements of will, emotions,mind, and consciousness within yourself.I like to work with a circle that repre-sents the energies from the realms of cre-ation to control the energies of a higherorder. These energies set a barrier ofnear-chaos energy between myself andthe HOE's that I cause to manifest. Con-versely the creative powers help themanifestation of the HOE's that I call inby supplying them with energy. When Iam one with the creative energies I havean excellent key to control the HOE's thatI am calling in. Rune Masters have noproblem with control of entities, providedthat they studied the Sacred Futhork, orthe eighteen creative energies of the uni-verse.Practice #40C: Dispelling the HOEDispelling is a form of control. Youhave to know the practices of dispellingbefore you begin with the exercising ofother forms of control. Again Onenesswith the Divine or awareness of your Di-vine nature by aligning the elements isyour most powerful weapon.If you have used a Welz Generatorto make the energy manifest, you needto remove it from the triangle. The sup-ply of life energy will stop.You proceed by grounding the lifeenergy. You have learned that life en-ergy follows the direction that your mindgives it. Imagine the life energy drainingfrom the triangle into the ground. Thistakes away the energy that the entityneeds to manifest.Then tell the entity to leave andthank it for its manifestation.Controlling the Energy witha Field of a Higher OrderThere are many practices that fallunder this category. Some authors givethe recommendation to identify with anentity that has a controlling power overthe spirit that you intend to command.Oneness with the divine principle is moreuseful. This is so because all entities aresubject to the Divine Will and because weare a reflection of the divine principle.Once you are one with the Divine and intune with the higher planes, you can com-mand the entities that inhabit theseplanes. You achieve Oneness with the di-vine by aligning the elements of will, emo-tions, mind and consciousness. I amteaching this practice in my Course onCosmic Consciousness. You find thiscourse for free on the Internet:www.hscti.com/cosconsThe practice that I have describedunder practice #40B also establishes a50 Tel. 770 924 0223 www.hscti.com - e-mail: sales@hscti.com"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"field of a higher order that controls theentity that you evoke. Another of my fa-vorite methods is a universal pentacle thatrepresents all the energies of the cabalis-tic system. If I put the square of a planetinto that universal pentacle, I generaterapidly the corresponding planetary en-ergy. Then I use this energy to controlthe entity that falls under its domain.Another problem with these old manu-scripts is the spirit with which they havebeen written. People for whom the bookswere written had a religious fervor thatwas a powerful protection. Hardly anyone of the modern magicians can claimto have such a religious fervor. Thereforea modern magician needs to use othermethods of control.Controlling the energy withthe threat of DestructionAncient grimoires abound withthreats of destruction if the entity doesnot obey. The threat of destruction is forreal. This does not mean that the entitywill be wiped off the universe for good. Itsimply means that the entity will lose itsastral body as related to the magician'srealm. When it loses its astral body, thedesire to manifest will cede to exist, andso does the chance to manifest in thematerial plane (etheric plane) of con-sciousness unless its astral body is recon-structed in some way. An entity whoseastral body is destroyed is removed fromits sphere of potential manifestation towhich it naturally gravitates. The self-preserving spirit of an entity will do any-thing to prevent such an effect.This is the meaning of having adagger, sword, or trident on the altar.These tools relate to the mental plane thatcontrols the astral world.An excellent tool that shatters anyastral form and makes it dissolve in theenergetic ocean of the universe is theblasting glyph. Its design reminds us ofMany of the more ancient booksof magic have evocative circles with somesymbols inscribed. These symbols arestructural links that connect you with theenergies that are superior of the entitiesthat you are going to evoke out of such acircle. You take the aspect of the control-ling deity without actually evoking it. Itis the part of that deity within yourselfthat is the controlling factor and not anexterior force.I suggest that you examine wellsuch a circle before you use it. Many ofthe old books contain mistakes that areput there on purpose or by negligence.Tel. 770 924 0223 www.hscti.com - e-mail: sales@hscti.com 51"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"a trident, but it has some Uranian andSaturnian nature to it. Simply imaginingthe blasting glyph and giving it an ethericform is a powerful weapon! You can al-ways use this tool when an entity refusesto leave. It is a tool that's quite convinc-ing when you wield it against an entity.PSYCHIC INTERFERENCEAt times magical work yields noresults. This has several reasons. Themain reasons are the following:1. The magician failed to establish a suf-ficiently powerful field of life energy. Trans-fer could not occur for that reason.2. The magician failed to establish theproper structural links, again with a lackof transfer.3. The magician lacked the capability tocontrol the spell energies.4. The target blocked itself psychicallyby setting up protective measures. Notransfer would reach it.5. Psychic interference caused blockageand/or deviation of life energies.The first three cases can be over-come with the appropriate training, tech-nological devices, and proper power sup-ply such as Welz Generators. Psychic in-terference and shielding need to be by-passed or overcome in other ways. Thisrequires that the magician recognizes thenature of psychic interference and thentakes the appropriate steps to be success-ful.New! The AO 2000 WaterOptimizerTMOrgone water is well known.

Therefore itwill be good that you use a model of theuniverse that enhances your work. Thismodel helps you make use of the struc-tural linkages that your mind can estab-lish. In this model, we distinguish threerealms.The first realm is your outer magi-cal realm. This realm contains all thephysical objects that connect with the tar-get of your operation and with the ener-gies of a higher order that you direct to-ward this target. It is the set up of youraltar.The second realm is the realm ofthe universes to which you have estab-lished structural links. This includes theuniverse (environment in a generalizedmeaning) of your target and the magicalhierarchies of the energies that you aregoing to use.The third realm is an imaginaryrealm that you create within your mind.This realm is a structural linkage to thefirst and second realms. The third realmallows you to mentally direct the ener-gies that you generate in your magicaloperation. It is a workspace within your-self that keeps up a constant connectionwith the other two realms. Whatever youdo within this space will have effect onthe other two realms.The correct setup of the first andthird realms is very important in magicalwork. This is so because in both theserealms we establish the structural linksto the elements of our action before weenergize the work with life energy.

Setup the two candles behind the pentacle,about 8 inches apart. Put the cup to theleft of the candle, the incense burner tothe right side. Put the crystal or penta-gram on the table between the twocandles. Put the four elemental designs(triangle, pentagon, square, and penta-gram) around the universal pentacle. Thetriangle should be to the top, the penta-gon to the left, the square to the bottom,and the pentagram to the right. You needa large pan with you that you need tohold the paper when you are burning it.3. Put the magical square of the planetthat reflects the energy of the Abramelinsquare that you have chosen in the topsection of the center part of the universalpentacle.4. Put the Sator Arepo Talisman belowthe square of Venus.5. Lay out the rope or cord in a triangularshape around the arrangement on youraltar. Instead of the rope you may usethree small crystals that you imagine con-nected with lines.6. With your wand follow the outline ofthe triangle, projecting energy into thelines that the rope defines or into theimaginary lines that you have set up be-tween the three crystals. In your imagi-nation build a tall pyramid with three sides.Put the base a bit beneath the surface ofyour altar.7. Put rope or cord in a circle aroundyou. Take your wand and trace the circle.Imagine a sphere enclosing you. Thecircle is part of the sphere. Later you maytotally visualize the circle without using arope.8. As an added protection you may takeyour wand and draw four pentagrams inthe air. Visualize them being on the sur-face of the sphere. Some people like toadd two more pentagrams: one on thebottom part of the sphere and anotherone above.56 Tel. 770 924 0223 www.hscti.com - e-mail: sales@hscti.com"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"9.

Persons who are involved inmagical practice but who do not have yetthe authority to control energies of ahigher order (\"spirits\" may become pos-sessed. The entity that has a good men-tal capability seeks to gain a permanentpoint to manifest. This process is like astone falling to the ground. It's a naturalcharacteristic of any entity, even a \"good\"one. It's preferable not to be possessedby any entity - neither by a demon nor byan angel. A human being with its Divinespark is born to have control at all times.Possession by a demon, an angel, or achanneled entity is against human nature.Consequently human beings have a de-sire to rid themselves from these entities.There are many ways in which posses-sion can occur. Sometimes temporarypossession is used as an effective magi-cal practice. Usually the persons who workwith the means of temporary possessionprotect themselves before doing so. Thisis the case in many traditional religiouspractices that include temporary posses-sion. Many of the \"channels\" do not re-alize the dangers of possession. Further-more, they do not know how to protectthemselves. \"White Light\" is highly insuf-ficient against skilled beings that wait inthe astral plane for manifestation in thematerial world. Another way a personcan become possessed is by means of58 Tel. 770 924 0223 www.hscti.com - e-mail: sales@hscti.com"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"attaching an entity to that person. A mildform of possession can be consistentnegativity of the person. Such an atti-tude builds up an entity whose only inter-est is to preserve this state of negativity.This is so because it gets its life from thenegativity of the person. Possession be-comes a problem when the person can-not get out of this state naturally. In suchcases a clearing is needed.Clearings can be done in manyways. The person may be strengthenedto a point where self clearing is possible.Another way is to attack the entity withinthe person and either destroy it or removeit. Kin to this way is the method to dis-rupt the structure of the entity by con-necting destructive energy to its struc-tural link. Finally we can use another en-tity that is stronger to get rid of the pos-sessing entity. Here too we have two waysto deal with the problem. The better ofthe two is in the case where the personwho clears has control over the entity thatclears. The other method is the way ofthe clerical exorcist. The possessing en-tity is replaced with the collective egregor(god) of the religion to which the clericbelongs.The clearing that I am going todescribe in the following requires from thepractitioner that he or she is well in con-trol of any entity. If this is not the case,the practitioner may become possessed.If you do a clearing of this typeyou need also be well familiar with themethods of directing life energy as I havedescribed in the second lesson.It will be also useful if you can vi-sualize well the symbol below. It is ablasting glyph. This is a design that shat-ters any kind of entity as you direct itagainst it. If you wield it toward the en-tity you need to direct the top part (thethree points) toward the entity.To clear a person you start by sur-rounding the person with a bubble. Havethis bubble about two feet away from theperson.The next thing you do is to focusinto the center of the person, around thesolar plexus area. From there you ex-pand slowly a bubble. You may have stud-ded this bubble with blasting glyphs. Thisprocedure makes the touching of thebubble a deadly thing for any entity thatis between it and the outer bubble. Ex-pand the bubble more and more until ittouches the outer sphere. You may runinto some obstacles in your procedure.It will be good if you practice withsimple clearing of negativity. Only after alot of practice should you go on to work inmore heavy duty clearing situations.A BRIEF INTRODUCTION INSYSTEMS OF STRUCTURALLINKSThis part of the course offers you abrief introduction in some magical meth-ods and their underlying symbolisms. Youmay select some of the systems that fol-low as a good basis for your further workand studies. I will give some emphasis tothe systems that I personally have cho-sen to work with. This does not meanthat you should practice with the samesystems.Systems of magic have the advan-tage that they provide you with a ready-Tel. 770 924 0223 www.hscti.com - e-mail: sales@hscti.com59"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"to-use magical hierarchy. Each of the el-ements of the hierarchy has specific at-tributes. What you do then with such asystem is combine its elements for anyone purpose that you desire.There are methods of magical tech-nology that do not use any magical hier-archy at all. Magicians who use thesemethods custom tailor their own struc-tural link to an energy of a higher order.This works because of the flexibility of theplanes of finer densities. Fact is that anyintelligently composed system will bringabout a connection with the energies thatare part of these planes. Even with ar-rays of symbols a skilled magician can es-tablish such connections.1. DIRECT STRUCTURALLINKSIn the first part I am going to in-troduce you to a few methods that arenot symbolisms or arrays of symbols.These are methods that the magician usesto establish direct structural links withHOE's. This method has the advantageof immense flexibility. The magician canformulate any desired trend and estab-lish a structural link that brings in the cor-responding HOE, or entity. Such meth-ods require no \"secret knowledge\" of anyhierarchy of magical energies, no mythol-ogy, and no religion.1.1. RadionicsThe core of the radionics device op-erates with electronic parts: mainly po-tentiometers and variable capacitors.These parts are connected to each otherand you can set their individual values withdials. You set the dials with the help of astick pad or pendulum. The mental focuson the target with which you intend toestablish a structural link is essential inthis operation.With a radionics device you can es-tablish structural links with anything youwant. The setting of the dials is called\"rate\" of that target, or trend.Radionics operators found that thewiring diagram of a radionics device canestablish a structural link just as well asthe device itself, provided that the rate isinscribed in it. If you have studied thelessons 3 and 4, i.e., the theories con-cerning structural links and equivalentstructural links, you will understand whythis is so.Modern researchers have added agreat deal of electronic gadgetry, pyra-mids, crystals, computers, and other \"pe-ripherals\" to the basic radionic device.Many of these gadgets have a symboliccharacter, most of the time to increasethe effect of the radionics device or to di-rect the device easier into a specific di-rection. Good examples are amplifiers toincrease power output, walkie-talkies tohelp telepathic transfer, and helmets toincrease power. Most amplifying gadgetsare unnecessary for the magician who hasrealized that structures transfer throughhyper spaces and that strong fields of lifeenergy ease such transfer. With a Welzgenerator of life energy amplifying gad-gets are obsolete. Other symbolic gad-gets are already inherent in the simpleradionics device, provided that the opera-tor knows how to set it.Some of the attachments to radi-onics devices help the operator find therate with more ease. A second radionicsdevice in conjunction with a Welz genera-tor will do such a job. Presently we areworking on additional methods to help theoperator find the rate easier.I see the radionics device as a uni-versal magical sigil. You describe whatyou want and you establish a setting thatcorresponds to your wish. This settingconnects you with the energy of a higherorder that will generate the desired trend.60 Tel. 770 924 0223 www.hscti.com - e-mail: sales@hscti.com"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"Combinations of Equipment,Kits, Work StationsFor Your Successful Practice Of Self-Help, Neuro-Cybernetic ProgrammingTM, General Trend Man-agement, and Electronic Mind Control Self-Help to improve intuition, creativity, men-tal capability, energy, relaxation, balance, innerpeace Neuro-Cybernetic ProgrammingTM (NCP) tochange trends of your life path and for protec-tion Trend-Management and Trend-Creation tocause abundance, prosperity, and a suitable en-vironment for all.

In this respect they com-pare to mythologies. Most symbolismsconnect with observable elements of ourenvironment such as the movement of theplanets in the sky. I view the system ofastrology as being a radionics device ofcosmic proportions. HSCTI offers a de-vice that is similar in structure. With thisdevice you can generate any astrologicaltrend that you desire and direct it to anytarget.Symbolisms have inherent struc-tures. If you know the structure of a sym-bolism and the meaning of one of its ele-ments, you can derive the meanings ofall its other symbols.For a specific purpose you need tocombine the elements of a symbolism.This required a thorough knowledge of thestructure of the symbolism.Some symbolisms are of an artifi-cial nature. Others, such as the four ele-ments, the four planes, the astrologicalsymbolism and the Eighteen FuthorkRunes, connect with real energies of ourenvironment. Mythologies correspond toour psychological and psychic environ-ments. Most useful are mythologies thatcorrespond to the astrological structure.62 Tel. 770 924 0223 www.hscti.com - e-mail: sales@hscti.com"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"I do not recommend that you getinvolved in artificial symbolisms. This isso because most of these artificial sym-bolisms are little more than arrays of sym-bols. You can generate desired effectsmuch easier with the individual methodsof direct structural links that I explainedabove. This fact makes study of these\"systems\" more a luxury than somethinguseful. Many \"mystery schools\" of course,love to teach the unsuspecting novices the\"secret knowledge\" of such arrays of sym-bols. Typically the novice who usually isnot allowed to study anything else is soonconvinced that such \"secret knowledge\"is the best system there is. I pointed itout above and I repeat it here:Tradition kills the creative mind!2.1. The Elements and the PlanesA fine system that corresponds toa good mapping of the magical universe.The elemental spirits that magicians con-nect with seem to be arrays of symbolswithin the specific elemental realms. Youcould classify them according to astrologi-cal and/or runic guidelines.2.2. The Eighteen Furthork Runes.The eighteen Runes are often re-ferred to as the \"Armanen System.\" Theyconnect with the periodic system of chemi-cal elements, hence they correspond toenergies of the creative realms. The en-ergies that correspond to these Runes areof a defining nature rather than a definedone. Other Runic systems are mere ar-rays. They are O.K. to do readings withand for some magic, but they cannot con-nect you with the realms of creative en-ergies. To study the magic of the Eigh-teen Futhork Runes you have the choiceof several courses: The Basic RuneCourse, the Rune Yoga/Rune Healingcourse, and the Rune Reading Course. Ihave authored these courses more than10 years ago and I have trained well over1000 students all over the world in thissystem. Ask for more details from HSCTI.2.3. The Astrological System, theCabalah, and the TarotHere we have to do with a systemof well defined (\"created\") energies.These energies correspond to the struc-ture of our Solar system. I mention thethree together, because the cabalistic sys-tem and the Tarot can be derived fromthe astrological symbolism. The Cabalahis a representation of the zodiac. Its nu-meric structure is derived from the nu-meric relationships that are valid for theSolar system.I recommend that you purchase agood introduction into astrology. Thisserves you to learn the meanings of theplanets, houses, and signs. Another bookof value is \"The Tarot of the Bohemians\"by Papus. In this work Papus explainsthe structure of the Tarot. To get moreinsights into the meanings of the Tarotcards I recommend any one of the booksby Eden Gray: Mastering the Tarot or theTarot Unveiled. My deck of choice is theRider Tarot Deck. I prefer it because ofthe accuracy of the cabalistic symbolismit represents. If you use the Tarot forreadings only, you can choose any one ofthe hundreds of decks that are on themarket. HSCTI can supply you with thesebooks plus a book on tarot spells and aset of astrological symbols.2.4.
