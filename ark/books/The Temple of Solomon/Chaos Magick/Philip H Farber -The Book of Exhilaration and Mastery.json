Farber /2IntroductionThere is a simple secret to the mastery of every human life and activity. Assimple as it is, this secret israrely taught and is mostly buried and obscured bythe complexities and trivia of our daily lives.It is, in fact, its simplicity and evenobviousness that allows it to be hidden in plain sight.As we grow from infants to adults,our ideas about ourselves are shaped,encouraged, discouraged, built up, torn down, honed, mutilated, perfected, andgenerally accumulated from everything and everyone we come in contact with.Our parents, teachers, friends, relatives, heroes, politicians, and the media offerus an endless stream of conflicting advice about what we should do with our livesand who we should be.Some of this advice makes good sense forsome people,some of the time. Some of it is pure cultural detritus, wisdom that may have beenuseful in another time and place but may only be a hindrance in our own lives.Some of it is just plain wrong.We followadvice from all these sources– we goto school, take jobs, associatewith friends, and form relationshipsbased on the information given to us. Andyet, for most of us, we are left feeling unhappy and unsatisfied with the results ofthese choices.Our jobs keep us alive, more or less financially solvent. Ourrelationships provide us with companionship, sex, and families, to a greater orlesser degree of satisfaction.But it is rare that any human distinguishes him or"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"©copyright 2006 Philip H. Farber /3herself in a way that could be called mastery. The list of people who haveex celled in any given field is usually quite small and the rest of us simply follow inthe footsteps of these giants.Most of us in our culture live a life characterized by activities thatgo no furtherthan survival and distraction. We spend most of our timeworking to make endsmeet and to entertain ourselves in the meantime.The outcome of this way of lifeis a cultural epidemic of depression, chemical dependency, andstagnation.There is much more to life than simply working and dying.Most of us grow upand grow old without ever understanding that we have formed our existencebased on the ideas of others– and that there may be something else, somethingbeyond cultural expectations and the roles that have been given to us by ourfamilies and society.Every single one of us has the potential for exhilaration and mastery. Everyhuman being on this planet has the abilityto rise above our current self concept.The secret, again, is a simple one that has been stated again and again, hiddenin plain sight in the philosophies of everysociety that has existed on PlanetEarth.The key to mastery exists not in what others have told us, but in theinformation that is inherent within us.The secret to mastery comes from"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"©copyright 2006 Philip H.

Are you ready to take theleap?"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"©copyright 2006 Philip H. Farber /5Part One: ProsperityWhen the word “prosperity” is mentioned, everyone has their own immediateresponse. For some the word elicits thoughts of money in abundance, for othersideas of a thriving family are foremost, for some “prosperity” is about abountifulharvest, or a fully stocked store, or a collection of books or stamps or coins– orjust about anything, given the diversity of humans and cultures on this planet. Forour purposes here we are going to use a very simple and open-ended definition:Prosperity isthe ability to do what you want to do.How many times have you heard someone say that they always wanted to writea book, or learn to dance, or start a band, or patent an invention– or any of athousand other activities– but they just didn’t have the time? Or they didn’t haveenough money. Or any of a thousand other excuses.How many times have yousaid these thingsyourself?Short of an accidental or untimely death, we all have roughly the same amount oftime. One lifetime. All our daysare the same length: 24 hours. Our weeks are allseven days and our years are always clocked by the same orbit of the planet. Sohow is it that some people manage to prosper in that time while others toilunhappily?How do a very few manage to not only excel, but change the world intheir lifetimes?"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"©copyright 2006 Philip H. Farber /6Here’s where prosperity comes into play. To have the timeand resourcesandmotivation to achieve mastery in a given field, at least some of our basic needs inlife must be fulfilled.The Basic Needs of Humans:Survival. Food, clothing, shelter, basic health.Power. Territory, possessions, influence over others.Information. Language, knowledge, science, problem-solving.Sex and Status. Ability to attract a mate.Transcendence. Altered states, “psychic”knowledge, ability to interactwith entities, awareness of internal and external consciousness.If we are in any way pre-occupied with a lack in our basic needs, we becomedistracted from the extended concentration and focus necessary to excel at ourchosen task.If we are working all the time just to survive, we will not have time todo anything beyond that. If we are in debt and immanent foreclosure or evictionpreys upon our mind, we are more likely to spend our time fighting the negativeconsequences as opposed to honing our craft. If we have no secure place inwhich to work, the paranoia and insecurity will likely cloud our efforts. If we areinhibited in expressing ourselves, or have some impediment to accessinginformation about our field, we will likely produce little useful outcome.If we are"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"©copyright 2006 Philip H. Farber /7obsessed with the failureof , difficultieswith,or lack of sexual relationships, theseconcerns will also cloud our efforts and impede our ability to act.In short, our basic needs must at leastbeaddressedbefore we can start tocontrive our circumstances in ways that support our intended work.Contriveyour circumstances to support your work. This is rarely something thathappens all at once or in a final way. We are working to satisfy our basic needsthroughout our lives.Some people reading this text will need to address theseissuessolely before moving on to the rest of the book. For most, however, this isa process that can continue as you move forward toward the mastery of yourcraft. (Figuring out what that craft mightentailwill come in a later chapter.)Thatis, you can begin with the exercises outlined in this chapter and continue withthem as you work with the rest of the material in this book.The Prosperity Technique:1. Identify some of thechallenges you have meeting the basic needs ofyour life.What worrying thoughts occupy your mind? What aspects of your lifetake up inordinate amounts of time that would otherwise be devoted to your ownwork? What stresses you out?2.Determine the opposites of those challenges.If youareconcerned withpoverty, then the opposite may be sufficiency. If you are concerned with a difficultrelationship, then the opposite may be a rewarding or pleasant relationship. And"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"©copyright 2006 Philip H. Farber /8so on. These will be unique for you.For this exercise, avoid excess. Stick withthe simplest opposite. If you think you should be rich and famous, allow that tocome naturally from the mastery of your work, in the later exercises. For now weare simply addressing basic needs.3.Breathe andbanish. Imagine a circle around yourself, at about the diameterof your spread arms. Sit or stand in the center of that circle. Fill your lungscompletely, with a slow, even inhalation. As you inhale, allow your attention toexpand to fill the circle. As you exhale, slowly, evenly, and completely, allow yourattention to contract to a single point in the center of your chest. Repeat at leastthree times.4.Form a visual image of yourself, standing or sitting outside the circle.Some people visualize more easily than others. If you find it easier to hear thesounds or voice of your imagined self or to feel your presence outside the circle,then begin with those senses. Then begin to fill in the other sensory details untilyou have at least a rudimentary visual image. An alternative method is to imaginethat you are looking at a mirror or a video image of yourself. This may takepractice, though I would note that at this point perfection is not necessary. Justknowing that the image you see is an image of yourself will be enough for now.5. Adjust the image into one of a self whohas alreadymet a particularbasic need.Work with just one of the basic needs you identified in Step 1 andallow your self-image to reflect the opposite of that need, as identified inStep 2.Keep the image confined to an image of your self– background details are notnecessary at this stage. Think about how this person that you see, who has"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"©copyright 2006 Philip H. Farber /9already resolved this particular issue, who hasalreadydeveloped the resourcesnecessary to satisfy this particular basic need, will look. What is his or herposture like? Facial expression? How does he or she breathe? What is his or herskin tone like? Which muscles are relaxed and which active?Remember thatthese details will develop and possibly even change with repeated practice.Again, stick with just one basic need for this exercise– you’ll be able to addressother needs as you repeat the exercise on successive days.6. Contemplate the image for at least 30 seconds.7. Pull the image into the circle with you and draw it into you.Wearit likeclothing, wrap it around you, let it interpenetrate your body and mind. Let yourown body, posture, breathing, facial expression, etc. reflect what you saw in thisimage. Let the memories of this (future) self who has already resolved this basicneed be your memories.8. Breathe and banish. Repeat Step 3.9. Be open to thoughts, epiphanies, and suggestions from yourunconscious mindthat may occur throughout the day as a result of thispractice.When you first begin to practice this exercise, allow time to learn the steps andallow for a learning curve in terms of visualization, imagination, and accessing ofdetails.Once you have learned the steps, take no longer than ten minutes topractice. Practiceno more than once a day, addressing only ONE basicneed per session."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"©copyright 2006 Philip H. Farber /10Part Two:Movingand BreathingMovingWe all have collections of postures and movements that are habitual to us. Somepeople have very free-flowing movements, others are rigid. Some move quickly,some slowly. Some stretch and some contract.Our bodies are capable of movingin ways that we rarely explore. How often do you raise your arms over yourhead? Or bend from the hip? Or walk backwards? Or do a cartwheel?Humans learn to move, when we are small, by watching others and thenexperimenting until we can imitate the movement. As a resultof this process ofimitative learning, our habitual movements are often culturally transmitted.Thiscan be fairly obvious when we consider behaviors including gestures, greetings,and social formalities.Cultural ideas of dress and propriety also influencehabitual movement. Some clothing is restrictive, for example. A businessman in atucked-in dress shirt will be unlikely to raise his arms over hishead. Women indresses and skirts learn tocross legs or keep thighs closed to accommodateboth dress and propriety. Business footwear is unsuitable for running or climbing.And so on."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"©copyright 2006 Philip H. Farber /11Body position and movement are closely associated with states ofconsciousness. Not only do posture and motion reflect internal experience, theyalso influence your state of mind.That you are capable of movement beyondyour habitualrestrictions suggests states of consciousness that remain latent.These states are there as possibilities only, most of the time. They representaspects of your unconscious mind, something that remains a part of you but israrely explored. Your potential.That potential, of course, can take many different forms. If you are going toexplore movements and combinations of movements that are part of this set ofunexplored potential, then by all meansselect those that representexhilarating and motivating experiences.The Freedom Dance1. Pick out somegreatmusic with a good tempo and dance toit.2. Get wild.“Dance as if no one is watching.” Move freely. Work and play with allyour muscles and joints. Explore your range of movement in every limb. Somepeople are more flexible thanothers;some have limitations due to injury orillness. Just do as much as you can.3. Repeat regularly."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"©copyright 2006 Philip H. Farber /12Adaptive Mimicry1.Observe other people and find exciting movementsand postures.Youcan look at images in the media, at athletes, musicians, movie stars, at yourfriends, family, and people you see on the street. If a movementor posturecatches your interest– it could be anything, a particular nod of the head, amovement of the hand, a manner of stance,or a new dance, amartial arts move,or a strength exercise– then remember it. If you can save it in some form thatyou can view later, so much the better. A picture, a video, a diagram, whateverworks for you.2. Learn the movements.Start with simple and basic movements before youadvance to more complex ones. Practice them.3. Any movements that encourageexhilaration and motivation, repeatfrequently.BreathingBreathing, like movement, provides a link to the unconscious mind. The control ofbreathing is usually outside our awareness, something that just happens while"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"©copyright 2006 Philip H. Farber /13our attention is engaged elsewhere. But we can, at will, change the way webreathe.Breathing is a vital function upon which most other physiological functionsdepend. Subtle changes in the depth, frequency or manner of your breathing willinduce pervasive change throughout your body. Every organ may be affected insome way, including your heart and your brain.Your state of consciousness isdeeply dependent on your breathing.Just as with movement, we have habitual patterns of breathing that we havelearned largely from the people around us. We’ve learned these habits usually onan entirely unconscious level. When we begin to consciously direct our breathingwe take conscious control of our state of mind.Explore the following techniques one at a time. Practice at least once a day andspend at least one week on each technique. Continue indefinitely with thetechniques that provide you the most exhilaration or motivation.The Full Breath (or Yogic Breath)1. Notice that there are three areas of the lungs.The lower part of the lungsiscontrolled by movements of the diaphragmand when you breathe from this part"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"©copyright 2006 Philip H. Farber /14your abdomen will rise and fall. The middle part of the lungs is controlled byexpansion and contraction of the rib cage and when you breathe from this partyour chest will rise and fall. The top of the lungs is controlled by movements ofthe shoulder blades and when you breathe from this part your shoulders will riseand fall.2. Practice breathing from each part of the lungs separately.3. Take a full, deep breath that fills all three areas of the lungs to theircapacity,without straining.4. RepeatFullBreaths, with no pause between them, at arelaxed andcomfortable pace, for at least ten minutes or as long as one hour.Ecstatic Breathing1. Breathe through your mouth,slowly and evenly, for about one minute.2. Breathe by drawing the air into the bottommost part of your lungs,deepinto your belly. Start with a slow, even pace then gradually increase the rate until,finally, you are panting, but still filling and emptying the deepest part of yourlungs.3. Continue to pant for half a minute then take a deep, full breath, filling yourlungs from top to bottom. Hold the breath for ten seconds, then release andbreathe slowly and deeply a few times. Then return to panting and repeat thiscycle until you have deepened your trance state."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"©copyright 2006 Philip H. Farber /15Expansion and ContractionAs described in the Prosperity Technique, you cannowapply The Full Breath tothis method: Imagine a circle around yourself, at about the diameter of yourspreadarms. Sit or stand in the center of that circle. Fill your lungs completely,with a slow, even inhalation. As you inhale, allow your attention to expand to fillthe circle. As you exhale, slowly, evenly, and completely, allow your attention tocontract toa single point in the center of your chest. Repeat at least three times."},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"©copyright 2006 Philip H. Farber /16Part Three:MasteryThe following exercise may be practiced daily, indefinitely or until you aresatisfied with the results. Once again, allow for a learning curve. The first timeyou attempt this it may require an hour or more to complete all the elements. Youmay also choose to practice it in increments, and build up your resources andabilities over a period of days until you are performing the entire operation.Whichever you choose, when you become proficient this may take no longer thanten or fifteen minutes to perform. It seems complex at first, but as you practiceyou’ll find it easier and easier to remember the various elements of the exercise.Developing Resources1. Select six qualities or behaviors thatare components of your highestaspiration.You may select qualities that youalreadyhave, strongly. You mayselect qualities that you are weak in and hope to develop. You may selectqualities that you do not have and hope to acquire. These could be chosen froma field of qualities that includes, but is not limited to, confidence, compassion,strength, intelligence, decisiveness,motivation, joy, sexiness, directness,extroversion, introversion, creativity, passion, leadership, intuition,spirituality,rapport, and so on.Select only qualities that contribute to your highest"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"©copyright 2006 Philip H. Farber /17aspiration, to your ultimate purpose and function on Planet Earth. At this point,your highest aspiration may be something vague that you refer to as“highestaspiration;” or it may be something very well-defined that you refer to by a termyou already know.For each of the six qualities that you have selected, develop amovement or gesture by the following process:2. Sitting or standing, recall a time when you had a powerful experience ofthe chosen quality.If you are working with a quality with which you have limitedor no direct experience, something you want to strengthen or acquire, then youmay select another person that you know who has this quality at times andimagine what it would be like to be that person at those times.3. Remember or imagine the visual components of this experience: whatcolors were in your field of vision, whether you could see movement or stillness,whether it was lightor dark, and anything else you can recall.4.As you notice what you saw, remember or imagine what you heardduringthis experience: sounds or silence, voices or tones, rhythms or noises,background sounds, and anything else you may have been able to hear.5. As you notice what you saw and heard, remember or imagine what youfeltduring this experience: notice where in your body the feeling begins andwhere it moves to as the feeling develops. Notice what kind of feeling it may be,pressure, temperature, movement, texture, or whatever it was that you felt.6. Give the feeling a color or colors.“If this feeling were a color, what would itbe?” Apply the color to wherever you feel the feeling so that you end up with acolored map of the sensation in your body."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"©copyright 2006 Philip H. Farber /187. Make the color brighter, richer, more vibrant, or whatever also makes thefeeling more intense.For most people and most feelings, making the colorbrighter or more vibrant will increase the feeling, although for some people andsome feelings makingthe color more muted or dimmer will increase the feeling.Use what works for you.Intensify the experience to exhilaration.8. Breathe deeply and make or imagine the color flowing through more andmore of your body.9. Feel how the feeling has intensified.Savor it.10. Take a deep breath and then express the feeling as a gesture ormovement.Take note of this movement in some form that will enable you toremember it later.11. Repeat for each of your six chosen qualitiesso that you develop a catalogof six movements that you can use in Part Two.These same six movements willserve you through many repetitions of The Mastery Technique. If you ever decidethat you want to change, tweak, or empower your work, you can return to thissection and create new movements based onthe same oralternative qualities.The Mastery Technique1. Imagine a circle around you, drawn on the floor.Make the circle abouttwice the diameter of your outstretched arms, or as close to that size as spacepermits."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"©copyright 2006 Philip H. Farber /192. Performat least three cycles ofExpansion and ContractionBreathinginthe circle.3. In your mind, notice six points along the circumference of the circle,spaced equal distances apart.4. Walk to the edge of your circle and pace around the circumference.Asyou getto each of the six points, perform one of the movements, as fullyand completely as possible, that you created in Developing Resources. Do thisuntil you have performed all six of your movements, one at each of the six,equidistant points.5. Return to thecenter of the circle.6.Face one of the six points. Imagine seeing yourself standing atthecircumference of the circle, performing themovementthat you performedthere.7. Take a Full Breath. As you exhale, using the entire breath, say the nameof the qualitythat applies to the movement and point you are looking at.At thesame time, imagine that a color or energy or vibration or sound or feeling isemanating from that image of you. Allow that color or whatever to fill the entirecircle.8. Take a moment to experience what that color or energy feels likeas youstand in a circle full of it.9. Repeat for each of the six points/movements.10. Take a moment to see all the self-images and movements at the sametime, along the circumference of the circle."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"©copyright 2006 Philip H. Farber /2011. Take a large step backwards.12. Imagine the six movement-images of yourself, either one at a time or allat once, whichever is easiest for you, moving into the center of the circle,just in front of you.13. Allow them to combinein whatever way they seem predisposed to. Theymay take a definite shape or become amorphous. They may still be recognizableas images of you, or they may not. However it happens is fine.14: Take Full Breaths anduse your exhalations to send attention andenergy into the shapefor at least one minute.15. Optional:In your mind you may now communicate with thisshape/entity. Ask it what it would like to be called, how to call it back againfaster and more powerfully. Ask it what you can learn from it concerning yourhighestaspirations in life or what it can tell you about changes, additions, anddeletions in your behavior and life in general that can bring you closer to yourgoals. And anything else that might occur to you to ask it, as long as you remainfocused on your highest aspirations and goals.16. Step forward, into the shape/entity.17. Take a moment to appreciate and enjoy the experience.Notice how youfeel, what you hear, what you see, and anything else that presents itself toconsciousness.18. Breathe and absorball your imaginings back into you,except the circle.19. Take at least three Expansion and Contraction Breaths.20Absorb the circle back into you."},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"©copyright 2006 Philip H. Farber /2121. Be open to thoughts, epiphanies, and suggestions from yourunconscious mindthat may occur throughoutthe day as a result of thispractice."},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"©copyright 2006 Philip H. Farber /22Part Four:Making It HappenThe Making Techniqueis essentially the same method as the ProsperityTechnique, however you will now begin using any and all insights gained fromthe Mastery Technique to define your goals and outcomes. That is, as your ideasabout your highest aspirations become more defined and more detailed, you canadjust your ongoing efforts to include them and to move well beyond basicneeds.Just as with Prosperity, it is likely that what you consider your highest aspirationor life goal will be an ongoing process, not something attained in a single effort. Ifit IS something attained in a single effort, then you can use this technique to helpachieve it– and return to these techniques to continue and go beyond it.Making Technique1. Breathe and banish. Imagine a circle around yourself, at about the diameterof your spread arms. Sit or stand in the center of that circle. Fill your lungscompletely, with a slow, even inhalation. As you inhale,allow your attention toexpand to fill the circle. As you exhale, slowly, evenly, and completely, allow your"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"©copyright 2006 Philip H. Farber /23attention to contract to a single point in the center of your chest. Repeat at leastthree times.2. Form a visual image of yourself, standing orsitting outside the circle.3. Adjust the image into one of a self whohas alreadydeveloped theabilities, skills, and resources to achieve Mastery.Use whatever informationyou gained during the days of working with the MasteryTechnique to know whatth is person you are looking at it is capable of doing, thinking, saying, andexperiencing. Keep the image confined to an image of your self– backgrounddetails are not necessary at this stage. Think about how this person will look.What is his or her posture like? Facial expression? How does he or she breathe?What is his or her skin tone like? Which muscles are relaxed and which active?Remember that these details will develop and possibly even change withrepeated practice.4. Contemplate the image for atleast 30 seconds.5. Pull the image into the circle with you and draw it into you.Wear it likeclothing, wrap it around you, let it interpenetrate your body and mind. Let yourown body, posture, breathing, facial expression, etc. reflect what you saw inthisimage. Let the memories of this (future) selfwho has attained Masterybe yourmemories.8. Breathe and banish. Repeat Step1.9. Be open to thoughts, epiphanies, and suggestions from yourunconscious mindthat may occur throughout the day as a result of thispractice."},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"©copyright 2006 Philip H.

The excuses are numerous and the inertia is enormous.
