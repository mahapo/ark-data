It wasan ominous moment, the kind that though significant only to a handful, nonethelessspawned rumor, hearsay, and the balance of that from which myth and legend are born.One such rumor is that the person responsible—or persons responsible, as some mightobject—was a renegade “Wandering Bishop”, acting under the auspices of theBlackLodge of Santa Cruz, a clandestine initiatory body that had formed near the heart ofthe Caliphate and now threatened its very existence. Personally, I felt such speculationwas mere fodder for foolish assumption, and am surprised to find it persists to this day.It is for this reason that I have found myself compelled to step forward, and presentthe truth of the matter as best I can.I can assure you that when I, the witness of these events, first came into contactwith the Caliphate, becoming embroiled in an insane plot to break away from thatcelebrated body was the farthest thing from my intent. Years of fascination with allthings occult had inflamed my young mind with possibilities of finding real magicians,of contacting, and maybe even gaining access to the secret and mysterious societieshinted at in the books of old. And what is worse, I was a joiner, and I presented myselfat Thelema Lodge in January of 1988, to do precisely that. I quickly became convincedthat, despite appearances, I had at last made contact withtrueinitiates, possessed ofthe keys that unlock the storehouses of Mystery for those bold enough to use them.For a time at least, I was not disappointed.Was I prepared for what I found? Primed for the baptism of fire I was about toreceive? Of course not. Nothing could have prepared me for what I was about to ex-perience. It wasn’t that their activities twisted reality into monstrous shapes for milesaround their Temple, even if I’d been capable of noticing if they had. It was simply thatthe beast, as it existed in that place, and at that time, was wholly unlike anything I’dever seen before. And I dare say I shall never see its like again.3"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Thelema Lodge was located in a rather dilapidated, two-story wooden structure inthe “bad” part of Oakland, California. To the best of my knowledge, Thelema was the“Mother Lodge” of the Caliphate, though you would never have guessed this, standingon the grimy sidewalk, staring at its sad façade. But inside, it was a truly magical place.In the front room of the house was “Horus Temple”, with Golden Dawnish pillars,oriental carpet on the floor, a large altar in the east, and a coffin—officially, “a tomb”—in the west. It was here that the Gnostic Mass was performed every Sunday, comehell or high water, and here that various classes on magick and other matters occultwere held on other days of the week. The social life of the Lodge revolved around thekitchen, much like any other home, and the rest of the building supplied living spacefor the varying assortment of folks who lived there, as well as shelf-space for the library.Outside the house of Bill Heidrick, author, occultist, and one of the founders ofthe Caliphate, I have never seen a more extensive collection of esoterica in my life.Everything, or nearly so, that one could possibly imagine pertaining to occult studieswas there, from Francis King’sSecret Rituals of the OTOto Higgins’sAnacalypsis, andall were welcome to avail themselves thereof. From Judaica to erotica, if you weresearching for it, it was probably there somewhere among the cases, stacks, and heaps.If you didn’t find it, however, your quest was not yet ended, for the resident librariancould tell you the date of its publication, along with those of any subsequent printingsand editions, the color and manner of its binding, where he had last seen a copy offeredfor sale, and provide a concise synopsis of its contents, all from memory.It was at Thelema Lodge, sitting on the floor in Horus Temple, in Bill Heidrick’smagick class, that I first saw the Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram demon-strated. My first initiation, it was. And it was there, under the influence of DavidJones, that I first developed a working interest in Enochian magick through his Cen-ter for Enochian Studies, commonly known as theces. This last character figuresprominently in the narrative to follow, being one of the people who stands accused offounding theBlack Lodge, so perhaps a few words would be in order.David Richard Jones, mild mannered Enochian scholar, collector of the library atThelema Lodge, student and practitioner of the weird sciences, was also known asthe Demon Jones, DavidFuckingJones—sometimes affectionately—Sri Dave—“haveashram, will travel”—and Fr Spartacus—iv◦, when first I met him, later advancedtov◦. Each initiate took an official motto in the Order, and Jones’s was always oneof my favorites, as “Spartacus” was also that of Adam Weishaupt in his Illuminati.4"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"I remember a time sitting in the library at Thelema Lodge with David, his bootspropped upon a desk, cigarette in hand, as he entered into a lengthy discourse on hisbelief that St Jude the Greater, the patron of hopeless causes, was in fact Judas Iscariot.I could somehow imagine Herr Weishaupt in much the same situation, debating apoint that only one who blurred the line between orthodoxy and heresy could possiblyappreciate.Jones was, to the best of my knowledge, the student of Bill Heidrick, or at the veryleast the product of his work, in so very many ways. He began his magickal career asa punk-rocker from Concord, California. While slam-dancing one night, screamingalong onpcp, he had a profound religious experience, his very own blinding light onthe road to Damascus. By his own admission, it was this event that led him to magickand mysticism. What exactly he experienced amidst the thrash and sweat I never asked,like so many things I never asked.David is one of the most enigmatic persons I have ever known. He infuriated hissuperiors by the contempt he showed for assumed authority, and just as often annoyedhis inferiors and compatriots with his near morbid insistence on orthodoxy, righteous-ness, and absolute adherence—at least for himself—to the letter of the Law. He onceprayed to the Blessed Virgin Mary for a supply of hashish—successfully, I might add—and during the Bishop of Rome’s visit to San Francisco appeared on stage at a concert,where he defecated, copiously, on a photograph of the Holy Father. I asked him howhe could do such a thing, to which he replied, “7–11 beef and bean burritos”. Yet Davidwas the only person I met in the Caliphate who looked me in the eye, and said drugs“are a vice, or they can be”. Morality itself may have been a plastic concept, but thedistinction between virtue and vice was an important consideration to a man such ashimself.As a matter of fact, David fulfilled the office of Priest in the Mass of the GnosticCatholic Church that first night we arrived at the Lodge. The Deacon, I later learned,was a loyal member of the Temple of Set. He had worked for a prominent televangelistin a former life, or so I was told, until he saw the Darkness, and mended his evil ways. Iwas impressed by that first Mass, though at the time, had no way of knowing just howgood it was. Sometimes they weren’t, but that really wasn’t the point. All genuinelyconcerned in the affairs of the Lodge took great pride in the fact that Mass had beenheld there every Sunday at sunset—more or less—for many years, and Caitlin Alicianewas the beautiful and absolutely dedicated individual who ensured it did.5"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Caitlin was tall, with long, red hair, and a delightful figure, which she would proudlydisplay as fully and as often as circumstance allowed. I remember her vividly the nightof some high holy day or another, wandering through the party in a very crowdedLodge, wearing naught but an eight-foot boa constrictor and a festive grin. Caitlinwas, without a doubt, one of the very few people, male or female, I have actually andunequivocally trusted. I would have handed her a knife in a bloody bar fight and turnedmy back without hesitation, confident that nothing and no one could approach exceptover her dead body. She was proud, and fearless, and sexy, and everything I wouldexpect a woman “girt with a sword” to be.Caitlin made the Mass happen. I don’t really know how she got stuck with thisresponsibility, but she did and took her charge very seriously indeed. It was supposedto mean she ensured that a Mass team was assigned for any given Sunday night. Butmore often than not, it meant she was Priestess, or Deacon, or went dashing throughthe assembled crowd at the last moment, pressing into service the first viable candidatefor a vacant office she found.The furniture of Horus Temple was good, or at least serviceable. The crown, lance,cup, and robe of the Priest—more like a Greek Orthodox chasuble, really—were actu-ally quite nice, but the rest of the costuming—what there was of it—looked more likesomething out of a children’s Christmas pageant. The robe of the Priestess was of noconsequence, as she would not be wearing it long in those days of wine and roses, butwhen the Priest stepped from the tomb, his threadbare attire immediately remindedone he was supposed to have been dead, for quite some time, by all appearances. Butnone of that mattered. It was the heart that went into the effort that was important.Sometimes the Mass was breathtaking, with communion resulting in a whole roomfull of people smiling and giggling like little children, quite drunk on a single cup ofwine. Other times, one breathed with the Priest a sigh of relief, as he turned to bestowhis benediction at the close of the Mass, amazed one and all we had made it to the end.And on the rare occasion, only the solemnity of the setting prevented one from laugh-ing, usually good-naturedly, at the comedy of the situation. One Mass in particularcomes to mind. The reading skills of the Deacon that night were somewhat lacking,and part of his version of the “Office of the Collects” went, “Mother of fertility onwhose breasts lies water, whose cheeks are creased by air...”,†rendered in a tremuloustone. He did the best he could, and at the endeveryonecheered long and loudly. Now†For those less familiar with this portion of the rite, the passage in question reads: “Mother of fertilityon whose breast lieth water, whose cheek is caressed by air...”6"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"the cheering was customary, but his effort meant more to us, and was more symbolic ofthe universal situation as we saw it, than any visiting Poobah proudly displaying theirsplendid regalia, in costume that spoke so eloquently of their status within the officialhierarchy.Thelema Lodge, in those days, lacked a certain respect for assumed authority, it istrue. But they did not oppose just any authority. Some of their elders were held in greatesteem. Bill Heidrick, then a high ranking officer in the Order, as he is today, was al-ways treated with the utmost courtesy and respect. And Grady McMurtry, HymenæusAlpha, the late Caliph, was held in unquestioned reverence by most everyone I knew.His memory was sacred, like that of a departed patriarch, as was his small, unassumingportrait that was always displayed in the Lodge. In it, he wore a turban, and looked hismost mysterious and benevolent best.It is easy for an outsider to dismiss Grady for too many reasons, some of them goodin fact. But when faced with the genuine love that glowed in the faces of so many whohad known him personally—the man, not the Caliph—it wasn’t so easy at all. Gradyand his wife, with the help of others, had worked hard to boot-strap the Order intoexistence, and regardless of how one feels about its legitimacy, the years of their livesthey had poured into the effort, the blood, the sweat, and the tears are beyond question.They both had their followers, and their detractors, and the rift their eventual divorcecaused among the faithful lingers in the Order to this very day. There are two partieswithin the Caliphate—or at least there were back then—that of the groom and that ofthe bride, and the rancor between them has haunted and plagued the Order from itsvery foundation.Grady had celebrated his “Greater Feast” by the time I arrived, and I unfortunatelynever had the pleasure of meeting his former wife, but I was told they were as differentas night and day. She was serious, and scholarly, commanding the respect she believedshe deserved, while Grady was more interested inliving, celebrating life and enjoyingthe party while he still had the chance. The “truce” between them, uneasy in the bestof times, rested heavily on the Order. Thelema Lodge was very much a loyal memberof the party of the groom, and proud of it.This conflict had come to a head upon Grady’s death in 1985, when the Order wasforced to choose a successor, and theix◦s split along party lines. After bitter discus-sion, it was agreed to choose a lesser, weaker, compromise candidate, rather than onefully supported by either side, or any side really, other than the candidate’s own. This7"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"compromise was made by Bill Heidrick—and I’m sure the rest as well—for the goodof the Order and in its best interest. As has been so often observed, the road to hell ispaved with good intentions, and in my opinion, this particular path was no exception.Such was the Order and such was the Lodge of my first experience. The politicsand infighting mattered little to me. I didn’t know any of these people, other thanHeidrick. I always thought he was in charge anyway, and couldn’t see what all the fusswas about. All I wanted to do was learn magick.8"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"IIFor someone eager to learn the practical side of the occult, Thelema Lodge was the bestof all possible worlds. Practitioners of almost every tradition imaginable attended onefunction or another, and every one of them was more than willing to express and discusstheir own idiosyncratic view of the subject. I met wiccans, ceremonialists, chaotes,topys, golden-dawners, qabalists, and some so eclectic as to defy simple classification.One was just as likely to bump into someone with years of experience as a rank amateur.Sometimes the experience was pleasant, sometimes enlightening, and sometimes eventhreatening. There was the occasional has-been, who showed-up drunk at functions,picked fights, and used the event as an excuse to engage in a psychic piss-fight. It wastheir only trick, and made them feelreal. But folks like those were well known, easilymarked, and certainly the exception.My then wife Susan and I took up the study and practice of magick, and quicklyamassed more information than we could possibly assimilate in one lifetime. We en-joyed the privilege of cornering David at every possible opportunity, pumping him fordata and insight. He was always open and easily approached, and gave to us freely of hisknowledge and experience. I suspected he was somehow affiliated with the A...A...,and though at first I was hesitant to ask, eventually I got up the nerve to express myinterest. His response was muted, though encouraging, and no further mention wasmade of it for some time.Our magical work started small and tentative, as it should. We learned the LesserBanishing Ritual of the Pentagram first, that most fundamental of ceremonies withinthe Golden Dawn tradition. I began practicingLiber E vel Exercitiorum, and Jones sug-gested I banish before each session, saying “Everyone has the right to make somethinggo away. If something is interfering with your yoga, banish it.”Liber Resh vel Helios,was soon incorporated into the structure of our lives as well. Four times each day—dawn, midday, sunset, and midnight—I repeated the appropriate adoration to the Sunin the “Sign of the Enterer”, as is mentioned inLiber AL vel Legis. I “keptResh” likethis, best I could, and so did Susan, but that was more the exception than the ruleamong many Thelemites of our acquaintance. Even at the Lodge on Sundays, Joneswould shout “Resh!” at sunset, and an often sullen crowd would amble out the back9"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"door and into the yard, where he or one of the other fanatics would lead the reluctantfaithful in their evening prayers—weather permitting, of course.We soon began to focus on Enochian magick in particular, with myself as ceremo-nialist and she as skryer, under David’s tutelage. Our progress was rapid, getting goodresults, without any real understanding on my part, but soon developing considerableskill and experience in the bare mechanics of it. Jones was pleased with our early suc-cess, and impressed by the mediumship skills displayed by Susan. She could “see” quitewell, but couldn’t hear, which made communication a bit of a challenge. I, on the otherhand, couldn’t “see” at all, so our work together was neatly divided between us. Joneswould later describe us as “Siamese twins”, two halves of a fully functioning whole.When we presented the transcript of our first skrying session to David, after makingour first tentative foray into the Watchtowers, he became rather excited, exclaimingwhat I had recorded was exactly what we should have seen. At the time, I took hisword for it, and it was only much later while reading Crowley that I discovered ourdata agreed substantially with his as well.I suppose that upon every parade some rain must fall, provided it marches longenough, and ours was no exception. After weeks of silence, David said he needed totalk to the two of us about something we wanted. Curiously, I had no idea what itcould be. The Lodge was preparing for the 1988 “Rites of Eleusis”, always a time ofnew beginnings, high expectations, dread and confusion. David wasMagister Templithat year, in the “Rite of Saturn”, and meeting with him in private, we were informedthat he would like us to participate as “Probationers”. He also said our interest inthe A...A... had been considered, and we were to be accepted as Students, Crowley’sterm for those in the outermost circle of that initiatory body. But, he added, ratherapologetically and without making eye-contact, “the Sanhedrin has decided” that itwas impossible for us to undertake this work together, and that we were to be tutoredby separate persons. I was to be farmed-out to Keith Schürholz, and he himself wouldbe overseeing Susan’s studies. I was deeply and profoundly troubled, to say the veryleast, and it is no exaggeration to say I never fully recovered.This turn of events disturbed me for several reasons. First and foremost was thatto the best of my knowledge, Susan had expressed no such interest. I had approachedDavid myself, for myself. His assumption was valid, I suppose, but it was mistaken,and I expected better of him and his superiors. In light of this, I thought then—andstill feel today—that innocent or not, it was remarkably poor form. My interest in the10"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"A...A... was wholly centered on David, and his involvement. I saw no one else thatI suspected of being a part of that body whom I wished to associate myself in sucha capacity. I thought the world and all of Keith, and had great respect for him andhis skills as an occultist, but his interests were not equivalent to my own. But by farthe darkest of my suspicions was that David had designs on Susan, either sexually ormagically, or both, and worse still, that the A...A..., despite my fervent hopes to thecontrary, was just another bunch of clowns in funny robes. Keith assured me that thelatter was indeed the case, and sympathized with me wholeheartedly, even praisingme for taking it better than he would himself under similar circumstances. This wascold consolation for me, and my doubt and distrust grew steadily in the dark recessesof my mind until it began to drive a wedge between Susan and myself, one whichwould eventually tear us apart. I continued with the curriculum of Student, as I hadbeen doing for quite some time, but began to question, seriously, the need for formalcourses of study and initiatory hierarchies.To those of you that have suffered patiently through this my painting of the back-drop for this drama I offer my sincere thanks, and apologize for taking so long. Forwe have come at last to the opening act, and as the curtain rises, we find our illus-trious cast discussing a proposal. Clay Holden, a Man and a Brother of Santa Cruz,California, had approached Mr Jones with an interest in Enochian studies, and in theensuing discussion, it was decided that David would provide a demonstration of howit was done in practice. He and theceswould take Holden and his associates into the22ndÆthyr, an exercise David jokingly referred to asEnochian D&D—with deliberatereference to that particular role playing game. The date is 5 March, 1989, the placeThelema Lodge, and David is asking me and Susan to participate, she as skryer andmyself as one of the operatives in some unspecified capacity. Of course we jumped atthe chance, and a date was set for 15 April.On 1 April ’89, I received myi◦initiation on a cool, drizzly day in Bill Heidrick’sbasement in San Rafael. I was reluctant to go through with it, but felt that I shouldat least join the group that I felt had contributed so much to my development, onewhich at that time I had no intention of leaving. I had a great time, all in all, mostlybecause I got to spend nearly the entire day with Bill. A few folks didn’t care for himpersonally, as he could be—how shall I say it—long winded. The guys in New YorkGrand Lodge were said to be terrified of him, but many members I knew were quitefond of our “Uncle Bill”, myself included.11"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"Bill’s house was an unassuming, red brick, ranch-style affair, and looked perfectlyordinary from the outside. The inside was a little different. It had seven rooms, and hehad painted each one a different color, each representing a different planetary sphere.The living room was blue of course, and was dominated by a huge, black sofa fromwhich Bill surveyed the world. I sat there that day like a child, listening to him holdforth on just about any subject you could imagine. There were similarities in our re-spective childhoods, and we sat and swapped stories about what it was like, growing upin town and spending weekends and holidays on our respective family’s farms. He evenshowed me an old photo album, with pictures of his grandparent’s place, complete withfaded black-and-white photos of old agricultural equipment, pulled by multi-horseteams.We feasted, after the initiations were over, on curried goat, bought especially forthe occasion from some Jamaican establishment. I thought it was surprisingly good,though possibly because I hadn’t eaten for many hours. Bill abstained, preferring hisDenny Moore Beef Stew, fresh from the tin. This was my first time at Bill’s house,and I was both thrilled and honored by the experience. Thankfully, it was not mylast, and if I have any regrets about the time I spent with the Caliphate, it was thatI didn’t go see him more often. Apparently, he was surprisingly open to such visits.It was required that one phone ahead, of course, but many of us in the area enjoyeda standing invitation to call. His status and various titles within the Order seemed sopompous, making him seem somehow unapproachable. In reality, he wasn’t that wayat all.Two weeks later, 15 April arrived, with much attendant expectation and littledefinite idea as to what might be the result. Susan and I packed up our newly fash-ioned robes of black raw silk and headed south on California Rt 17 for Santa Cruz,leaving behind us as we did the crowds and congestion of the Silicon Valley. Thearea southwest of the San Francisco Bay, where our Mountain View apartment waslocated, had once been covered in citrus groves before yielding to the sterile fields ofour modern world, and had suffered development into the archipelago of obsessivelymanicured lawns in a shimmering sea of pavement it is today. Our highway wound usto the top of the mountains that wall the area, up to the cool brightness high abovethe Pacific Ocean, and down again to Santa Cruz far below. From the heights abovethe town you could see the Monterey Trench, a submarine abyss that snakes its wayfrom the deep and into the bay, like a river of ink in an expanse of green and blue.12"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"We met Clay Holden, by prior arrangement, at a café downtown, and followed him toan apartment in a small, multi-unit complex on Seabright Avenue. David was there,presenting himself with a calm confidence that only slipped momentarily when he tookus aside, and said, “Remember, no martyrs!Okay?” his eyes shifting from one of ourfaces to the other. “If things go wrong, head for a door, or a window, and don’t lookback.” I agreed, but was left deeply puzzled by what he could possibly have feared.Holden introduced us to his girlfriend April, a student at the University of Califor-nia at Santa Cruz [ucsc], petite and chestnut brown, in dreadlocks and wire-rimmedglasses. Aside from Jones, who acted as ring master and calledparaoan, a Governorof the 22ndÆthyr, the ceremonial team included Susan as skryer, John Golding, andmyself. Golding was a carpenter, who had relocated to Oakland from Louisiana, anda Golden Dawn ceremonialist. He and I, along with another associate from theces,performed the “square workings” used to invoke two of the three canonical Governorsof the 22nd, myself callinglaxdizi, presumed to be a mysterious fourth. Golding alsodoubled as scribe for the evening. Laura Chandler and her partner from the Lodgewere also present, and others from there whom I’ve doubtless neglected to mention,along with several friends and associates of Clay and April. The demonstration wasa whopping success, and came offwithout incident. The ritual proper stretched onfor a couple of hours, while we “worked” the system in a largely traditional fashion.There was concern going in that the attention of so many might wander, during thelong skrying session that followed, and thus interfere with our focus. Surprisingly, thiswas not a problem, as everyone in attendance appeared riveted throughout. There wasa tense moment when David asked the skryer to move closer to a representation oftheMysterious Seven-fold Table, and the skryer immediately went into a dhyanic state,going offlike a pinball machine. She was fine—more like ecstatic, really—and Davidand I knew this, having seen it before, but the rest in the room that night were morethan a little shaken. He lit a cigarette when he saw them grow tense, though the roomwas assumed to be “smoke free”, and they calmed down immediately. I had heard ofthe soothing effect of tobacco smoke on falcons, but had never before seen it work onhumans. None of us knew what to expect going in, as none of us had ever tried to takea group of any size into an æthyr before, at least not in such a fully developed form.13"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"IIIRite,n. A religious or semi-religious ceremony fixed by law, precept or custom, withthe essential oil of sincerity carefully squeezed out of it.Ambrose Bierce, The Devil’s DictionarySusan and I attended Mass nearly every Sunday evening for about two years, usuallycontributing a case of beer to the social preceding the service. Even with their upsand downs, these were dearly cherished hours of fellowship, and over time, what wasoriginally a mere gathering with friends came gradually to acquire a deep religious sig-nificance for us both. We enjoyed attending Mass, more so with each passing week,and came to accept it as an integral part of our lives. As in so many adoptive communi-ties, regularity in attendance often leads to increased participation. In the Fall of 1988,I first participated in a Mass of theEcclesia Gnostica Catholica[the “Gnostic CatholicChurch”, oregc], fulfilling the office of Inner Guard. In December of that same year,I was Deacon for David and Caitlin, and shortly before the vernal equinox in 1989, mywife and I were baptized into theegcby Mordecai Shapiro, a Bishop in the Church,and a Brother of relatively high degree in the Caliphate.It followed, naturally, that sooner or later we would fulfill the offices of Priestessand Priest, and on 14 May, 1989, Laura Chandler informed me she had just signedus up to do so. I just smiled stupidly—angelically—and said, “Great”. She went on toexplain she wanted to be Priestess in some future Mass with me, and felt that it wouldbe improper if Susan and I had not done so together first. For that I had no responseat all, as my brain had just shut down and taken my cardiopulmonary functions withit, seemingly for good.Laura was one of the most beautiful young women I had ever known, so much sothat from the first time I laid eyes on her, despite being nearly ten years her senior, itwas much easier to simply do whatever she asked—without question—rather than risketernal damnation in some struggle for my mortal soul. Jones and I, when comparingnotes much later, discovered we had this weakness in common. He had not been nearlyso lucky, and developed a stormy relationship with this grey-eyed goddess, one whichnearly drove him insane. My most vivid memory of her is also one of my earliest, froma time soon after her arrival at Thelema Lodge from New Orleans. It was the 198814"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"“Rite of Luna”, David was “Satyr” for the pageant, and Laura was “Nymph”. At onepoint in the festivities, she was crawling slowly across the floor towards me, while hevigorously lashed her upturned butt with a belt. I was held in that gorgonian stare ofhers, like some beast caught in the headlights of an oncoming truck, saved only by hermercifully swerving aside. The first time David had met her, he sat down at her feetin a trance, and from that moment onward was locked in a bhakti from which thereseemed no escape, however violently he struggled to free himself. He confided in methat my solution, that of serving her will without succumbing to her ample charm, wasby far the better choice.Word spread quickly about the success in Santa Cruz, and came to take on greatersignificance than any of us had imagined. The transcript of Golding’s record had goneround and was the talk of the Lodge, as was Susan, and myself to some more limitedextent. She was now recognized as askryer, of exceptional talent, and I as anEnochianMage—Caitlin’s oft used term. Both of us were even more strongly associated withDavid and theces. It was only a matter of time before those of higher political statussaw the advantages of successful group working, and the public acclaim it obviouslybestowed. Consequently, it came as no great surprise when the first politically chargedevent, divisive enough to catch our attention as such, began on 15 June, shortly be-fore the summer solstice of 1989. Mordecai Shapiro approached me and Susan aboutdoing some “work” for him, offering no details other than the date. I’d never seen himbetray any inclination or talent for ceremonial work before. It seemed obvious thatShapiro—or one of his superiors—was envious of the fame that had spread regardingtheEnochian D&Dsession in Santa Cruz.Mordecai also approached a friend of mine with the same proposition, a skryerof no mean skill with whom I had worked before. He was more forthcoming in thisdiscussion, and confided to my friend his intent to indulge in some formal Goëticevocation. The fellow later told me he would do it only under the condition that Ibe there, “to back him up”. To skry is by definition to put oneself in a rather passiveposition, and his hesitation to place his wellbeing in the hands of a dilettante likeShapiro was entirely reasonable. He further suggested that Mordecai was motivatedby vanity, pure and simple. Susan agreed, and so the decision of all rested with me. Isaid hell no, desiring no part of it. If Shapiro wanted to take up ceremonial magick,he could do the work himself. The skryer told me the demon under consideration wasBael, which he considered to be a mistake, thinkingFurcasa much better choice. My15"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"friend reasoned that sinceBaelheld the rank of “King” in the infernal hierarchy, thatparticular spirit would be more likely to take offense at being summoned for sport, andwould in any case be far more difficult to constrain to the operator’s will. Moreover,his seal must be made of gold, and it was thought highly unlikely that Shapiro wouldactually go to the trouble and expense of acquiring a sufficient quantity of that metal.By contrast,Furcaswas but a “Knight”—the only one of all the seventy-two—and hisseal was to be constructed of lead, obviously much cheaper and easier to obtain. Bychoosing to call this spirit instead, the operation could be performed by the book, butwith a minimum of effort.I broke the news to Mordecai at the following Mass, that sadly, we would be forcedto decline his offer. He took it politely, but was rather cool towards me thereafter. Aweek later, I got a report from Keith Schürholz on how it all turned out.When Shapiro struck-out with both skryers, he turned to David, who suggested atechnique seldom seen in these latter days: trance mediumship. He volunteered to sitin the “Triangle of Art”, while our would-be Faustus and company evoked a certaindemon into Jones, one with whom the medium enjoyed a certain familiarity. Mordecaiaccepted his offer, rather than face certain humiliation. The ceremony took place asplanned, and was apparently—at least from a technical aspect—a success. Keith said heintervened only when the medium—or at least his body—had left the Triangle, locatedan aerosol can of ether, and proceeded to spray it upon his own bare skin, and set italight. When the operator just stood there, saying, “Uh, David, I think you shouldn’tdo that. Could you get back in the Triangle?” Keith grabbed the sword away fromthe unfortunate, and commanded “Mr Jones” to cease and desist, and repair himselfat once to his proper station. Apparently, the demon was then properly banished, andthat was the end of it.Jones confided to me, some time later, how stupidly they had all behaved, and howsurprisingly indulgent the demon in question had been. They had wanted to knowwho would win the World Series that year, and when given what later proved to be thecorrect answer, they did not know enough about either baseball or betting on sportingevents to properly interpret the response. Finding themselves at a loss, they demandedhe deliver the answer at once, and stop evading their questions. David was personallyvery surprised that the whole affair did not turn uglier than it did.Two weeks after Mordecai’s technical success, in the late afternoon of 16 July, 1989,we arrived at Thelema Lodge prepared to be Priest and Priestess in the Mass that16"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"evening. After last minute car trouble and many hours of rehearsing and coachingearlier that week, from Caitlin, our Deacon, the moment had come at last. When allwas prepared, she lifted the curtain that covered the doorway of the Temple, crying,“Procol, O Procol este profani”,while I stood shaking in my shift in the plywood tomb,sweating and terrified. But by the power of iron I arose and came forth at Susan’scommand, and all went remarkably well from that point onward, if I do say so myself.She had not looked as beautiful on the day I married her, and on that occasion shewas gorgeous—a little tipsy perhaps, but still gorgeous just the same. We played to apacked house of friends and compatriots, and it was a sublime and moving ceremony.As all assembled were advancing to the altar, one at a time to commune, MordecaiShapiro came forward in his turn, leering like a madman at Caitlin and ourselves, andwhen handed his goblet of wine, poured it over his head and left the Temple. It was anact as shocking as it was mysterious, and at the time I had no clue as to why.When all those in attendance had received communion, but before I bestowed mybenediction, Caitlin stepped forward, called for their attention, and proceeded, as aBishop of the Ecclesia Gnostica Catholica, to ordain us, Priest and Priestess. Shehad informed me of her intention earlier that week, and seemed at the time curiouslyresolved to do so.It was a wonderful ending, at least for Caitlin, myself, and most of the congregation.But not for Susan, as her ordination had come as a complete surprise, and she was morethan a little put out. The oversight was my fault, I suppose, or at any rate she blamedme for not telling her in advance, and this fact speaks volumes about her, and ourrelationship together. Caitlin had told me in private, and Iassumedshe had told Susan,and if not, I honestly believed it would be a pleasant surprise. Caitlin had ordainedus because she wanted to recognize our dedication to the Church in general, and theeffort expended in preparing for this Mass in particular. Rare were those individuals,either Priest or Priestess, who essentially recited their part from memory, and we haddone precisely that. Apparently, the ecclesiastic hierarchy did not think these weresufficient grounds for elevation to such an office, and Caitlin’s well intentioned act ledto a series of reforms pronounced from on high, reactions and yet further reforms,that culminated in the rash of Wandering Bishops that sprang-up a year later, andBill Breeze’s consolidation and concentration in himself of temporal and ecclesiasticalpower within the Order. But of all this, and its consequences, I knew nothing at thetime.17"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"I do not at this late date recall exactly when they took place, but that reforms wereenacted in the Church by Breeze is a matter of public record. In less than a year fromthe night Mordecai stormed out of Horus Temple, the Mass,Liber XV, was madeofficial, and any deviation from the norm could no longer be labeled “the GnosticMass”. This came as a slap in the face to many of us at Thelema Lodge, robbing us ofthe freedom to alter the Mass as need arose, using the Mass to further our work, andthe proud claim we had enjoyed that the Gnostic Mass was held every week. Therewere apparently changes made in who could and could not become officially recognizedClergy in theegcas well. The result was that excepting certain special occasions, Iincreasingly abstained from attending Mass, as did Susan. Following Jones’s example,we were very conservative in our interpretation of the sacrament, and what libertieswe were prepared to take with the accepted ceremony. This was not true of all Massteams, and though respecting their discretion, we often declined to participate. Thiswas a major shift in attitude on our part, and its consequences can not be overstated.18"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"IVOn 9 August 1989, the phone rang with a message for Susan and me, on behalf ofMr Jones: Jim Graeb was now officially banned from Thelema Lodge. Despite the factJim had been Master there himself some years before, the only surprise this news heldfor us was just how long it had taken. He had been one of the “originalix◦s” of theCaliphate, and was said to have been a lawyer at some time or another, though I wasalso led to believe he no longer practiced, for whatever reason. Graeb made his firstimpression on me at the Lodge, where I entered a room once, and found him makingtime with Susan, chatting her up with oily smiles and practiced charm. She greeted me,and when I was introduced as her husband, he casually proceeded to offer the two of ustheix◦. Needless to say, I betrayed no interest in his seemingly gracious proposition.Jim had a girlfriend named Trina, whom Caitlyn gleefully called “the Destroyer”,though precisely why she never said, and to look at the woman, there seemed preciouslittle reason to ask. One of the more deplorable attempts at a religious service I had everseen was Jim and Trina celebrating Mass, one unfortunate night in Oakland. Graebappeared to be drunk, if his faltering speech and swaying stance were any indication,so drunk in fact he could barely stumble through reading his lines, pausing and cursingin mid-sentence while squinting at his script. But to give the man credit, remember-ing her mountain of quivering flesh perched daintily upon the altar, bare-ass naked, Iwould have to have been hammered myself.An ongoing fight between Graeb and Trina on the one hand, and near everyone elseon the other, would soon develop into an attempt to destroy the Lodge itself, less thana month after Jim was banned. It seems by this time the two were no longer together,and Trina’s neighbor, someone who was vaguely associated with Jones, obtained a re-straining order against Trina’s new boyfriend, one who himself had been banned lessthan two years before. This petty squabble led to a chain of events that would result inThelema Lodge being raided by the Berkeley police.Five days after receiving David’s message, we attended “Jurgen Mass”, a loose in-terpretation based on the James Branch Cabell novel of the same name. It was the firsttime we had gone to Oakland in the four weeks since our Mass together, and we werevery warmly received. Afterwards, we sat around drinking rum and smoking cigars19"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"with David, discussing the possibility of using Susan’s skills as a microbiologist to setup anaidsresearch facility in Haiti. Jones had taken a curious interest invoudou, afterbeing introduced to William Gibson’sNeuromancertrilogy, by a young student namedJohn Oberon. Over the months to come, Oberon would figure prominently in severalof our magical activities. He was a computer science major, a programmer, rumoredto be a hacker, and known to be a fine keyboardist, with extraordinary talent in bothmodes of expression.We returned the following week for an “orthodox” Mass, performed by the lateEbony Anpu, and though we were in the building, my wife and I did not attend.Our abstention was not intended as a slight by any means, as we both liked Ebonypersonally and respected him as well, and due to his reputation as a ceremonialist, hisperformance was eagerly anticipated by all. For no particular reason, we chose insteadto sit in the library, with Keith and David, discussing, among other things, finding away of attributing the elements to theservient squaresof the Watchtowers, one superiorand more intuitive than that inherited from the Golden Dawn. I became inexplicablyill during the Mass, and did not feel the slightest bit better until Susan had driven ustwenty miles to the south, away from the Lodge and half of the way home. I did not atthe time consider the possibility that the Lodge was even then under attack, and onlynow reading my journal entries in retrospect does the connection appear obvious.At home in our duplex apartment in Mountain View, I set to work finding a moreserviceable set of attributions for the squares. Throwing myself into the task posedlittle difficulty. I was eager to free Enochian as much as possible from the GoldenDawn tradition, and three days after the discussion, I had what I felt was a workablesystem in hand. Unfortunately, so did Susan, and when we presented both to David onthe following Sunday, he chose hers as best meeting the criteria he had privately set foran acceptable solution. I was crestfallen, but proceeded to apply myself to yet anothertask, this time a search for a comparable set of attributions for thecherubic squares.I had only been studying and applying Enochian magick in earnest for a year orso, very much still in the blush of a new found field, and perhaps that explains why Ihad developed such definite ideas about how it should—and should not—be practiced.Such prejudice seems commonplace in the newcomer. Keith once said to me, in thehushed yet insistent tone of one who is certain they are conveying the profound, thatthe revelation of St John the Divine is the genetic material of the New Testament,the genotype to which Christianity owes its existence, and from which it is unable to20"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"wholly distance itself, however arcane and disturbing its imagery might appear to mostmodern believers. He compared the Bible to a spermatozöon, propelling itself throughhistory, withRevelationas its “head”, its precious cargo and reason for being. Enochianmagick, as received and developed by John Dee, is fundamentally intertwined with thatapocalyptic vision, drawing many of its ideas and images from that text.Keith’s image ofApocalypsis, however appropriate it might be, is certainly true ofEnochian with respect to the Golden Dawn. Dee’s system is the seminal idea in-forming that late nineteenth century effort to create a functioning magical group.Most of the Golden Dawn’s teachings are in one way or another ultimately broughtto culmination in “The Concourse of the Forces”, the Inner Order’s elucidation ofEnochian magick. Those who wrote the initiation rituals of the “Elemental Grades”employed the Watchtowers singly to erect their Temples and prepare the space for theadmission of the candidate, and collectively they were used to consecrate the “Vault ofthe Adepts” itself.I had learned this much at an early stage. When I asked him how to begin studyingceremonial work, David had suggested I compare Regardie’sCeremonial Magicwiththe Golden Dawn rituals, paying particular attention to how source materials wereadapted and developed in each case. Anyone who undertakes this exercise may provefor themselves how inextricably bound that order was to the work of John Dee andEdward Kelly. By this time in my newly fledged magical career, after studying theEnochian source materials through Casaubon’sA True and Faithful, James’sEnochianEvocation of Dr John Dee, and in photocopies of the relevant manuscripts found in theBritish Museum, I had come to understand just how little Mathers and Westcott hadunderstood the system. While it is true they accomplished a phenomenal amount withwhat little they knew, this does not change the fact that some of their interpretationsand elaborations were questionable, to say the least. This knowledge was fertile groundfor the dark doubts I then held about the validity of the A...A..., and every otherclaimant to the Golden Dawn tradition. Enochian, to my mind, and I believe David’sas well, had taken on a decidedly revolutionary flavor, and to state the simple facts ofthe subject was itself an act of rebellion.As the summer of ’89 drew to a close, a sense of foreboding crept into my life,a feeling that something loomed unseen in my world, menacing my otherwise stableexistence. Susan and I had planned to attend a concert with friends on 30 Septem-ber, but when the day arrived, I became extremely agitated, refusing to go at the last21"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"minute. After I had calmed down somewhat, we received a telephone call from KeithSchürholz, one we would have otherwise missed had we gone to see the Grateful Deadas originally intended. He told us the Lodge had been raided the night before, andmost everyone we knew in Oakland had been arrested by the Berkeley police. We werestunned, but forewarned is forearmed, as they say, and with wild thoughts of beingnext on the local constabulary’s agenda, the two of us immediately sought an oracle,receiving hexagram 33, “Retreat”, moving to 36, “Darkening of the Light”. After care-ful consideration, we decided to best apply this sage advice by opening the Watchtowerof Earth, and laying low for the time being. Our hapless friends to the north had nosuch option. David was Lodge Master by this time, and he later told me that whenthe police arrived at his door, he had asked to see the warrant authorizing the search,as was his legal right. By way of response, he was handcuffed, thrown down a flight ofstairs, and the paper derisively thrust in his face.Three days after the raid, we were served with a thirty-day notice to vacate ourapartment. I summoned the six Seniors of Earth, looking for answers, and they camethe next day in yet another telephone call from Keith. He explained that Trina’s boy-friend had asked Jones for protection, and when the restraining order was obtainedagainst him back in August, he and Trina had retaliated against the Lodge. On 17October, in the midst of all our troubles, the Bay Area was rocked by the Loma Prietaearthquake, measuring a bone-jarring 7·1 on the Richter scale. Sitting in our apartmentthat night, listening to the radio by candle light and straining for sign of the nextaftershock, the world we knew appeared to be coming apart at the seams.It wasn’t really coming apart, and despite trials and tribulations, life went on, forus as well as those at the Lodge. On 19 November, we journeyed there on a Sundayevening, despite a failing transmission in our automobile, discovered en route as fifthgear failed, followed soon by fourth. I usedanaaas a mantra, the name of an angel oftransportation, and arrived safely as planned. I played chess with friends, lost and won,and it was proposed in the course of the evening that we enter the 19thÆthyr,pop,atthe end of the month. Every year, alone or in groups, many of those associated withtheceswould read aloud the “Vision and the Voice thereof” for each æthyr, on theday of the year upon which it was first received by Crowley in 1909. The 20thand 19thfall on 30 November, and this year, David Jones and John Oberon were opening eachæthyr in turn, in the same sequence and on the same day of the year as had Crowley.It was what is affectionately known, after the late Roger Zelazny, as a “hell ride”.22"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"They wanted me and Susan to participate, and expressed hope that her skrying skillswould make this attempt successful where previous efforts had failed. I was not at allkeen on the idea, but characteristically raised little if any objection at the time. It is nota peculiarly pleasant space by any means, so much so that it would necessitate openingthe 18that home ourselves, on 1 December. There is no known means of banishingan æthyr once opened, the only remedy being to move on to another. David describedthe 19thas much likezax, the 10thÆthyr. It largely involves the facing of one’s worstfear, save only inpopone still has a choice; inzax, there is no hope of avoiding thenightmare. Susan, however, was willing and perhaps even eager for the experience. Iresented this to some extent, and it generated much friction between us in the daysahead.On the evening of 28 November, after a pleasantly prosaic evening together, Susanand I robed and entered our Temple. As she sat in the east with our flawless crystallinesphere before her, I performed the Lesser Banishing Rituals of the Pentagram andHexagram, purifying the ritual space with water and consecrating it with fire and theappropriate words. I then rehearsed a rectified version of the “Fundamental Obeisance”of John Dee, parted the Veil, and recited the First and Second Enochian Keys, withthe gestures and pentagrams associated with each. All this while Susan was observingthe effects in the crystal, and after I read the Call of the 22ndÆthyr, and summonedparaoan, she began in that almost mechanical voice of hers, “There was this nakedfemale figure kneeling. It’s very vague. Now it’s got shadows coming across. . . There’s,like, this series of buildings, they’re sort of gold. . . gold and black. . . Then on the faceof them, in the middle of it, there’s a figure. It’s got a beac. . . a gold beacon. . . standingin the doorway, holding the beacon above its head, arms forming an opening. It wentto blackness, and it came back. The buildings have sort of a courtyard. . . towers. . . Isee three. They go all around, three on each side. It’s wearing gold and its arms arefolded.” And so it went for an hour, perhaps more. The remainder of the informationreceived was largely of a personal nature, in response to my questions, and neither ofus were disappointed by the results.I sat on the train to San Francisco, when 30 November arrived, gazing at the settingsun while Susan read aloud for us “The Cry of the 20thÆthyr, which is calledlin”. Wewere met at Keith’s apartment on Haight Street by David and Oberon, and togetherwe attempted to enter the 19thÆthyr, much as my wife and I had opened the 22ndtwodays earlier, on the eightieth anniversary of Crowley’s having done so in 1909.

Our best efforts, though so far as we knew technically correct, metwith failure. It became apparent that the guardian or guardians of the place remainedunsatisfied, and after consulting the Goëtic spiritGaap,we retreated and stayed our-selves in the 23rd.We determined through enquiries put to the entities contacted that our approachto the 19thÆthyr was too “heavy”, for want of a better word, bringing to bear forcestoo great on what was revealed to be a surprisingly delicate task, that of easing into thenightmare world of the Abyss. We slept that night on the floor of that decrepit, oneroom apartment in the Haight, now become a gateway we had yet to close, and thenext morning resolved to remain in the 23rdÆthyr for the time being. I was fine, to allappearances, when Susan and I left for our home in Mountain View, but in the daysfollowing I was left shattered and staggering as my world fragmented around me, andI along with it. Three days after our opus in the Haight, my wife and I had a big fight,and she asked me to leave. I didn’t, and it seemed to blow over, but my journal entriesof the time, typically recording the spiritual and mundane minutiae of my life in greatdetail, are fragmented for days following our return, sometimes not even recording somuch as the date for a given event.Like most who for whatever reason find their way to the weird sciences, I hadbrought along much baggage from my past, issues and their tensions in my characteras yet unresolved. The grueling regimen of yoga and ceremonial work to which I wasthen subjecting myself was inexorably amplifying each and every flaw in my personality,as should be expected. Though still capable of composing myself and dealing with thereal world, I was nonetheless coming apart. In the career of the magician, when theyreach that pinnacle of accomplishment and face the outermost Abyss, it is assumedthey will be able to make a cautious and judicious approach before allowing all thatthey have, and all they’ve become, to be ripped away, as they are flung helpless into theDeep. I was young, and rash, and simply could not see that for all the care I took inavoiding disaster, the things that I had set myself to study, and to attempt, would leadme to face the destruction of my life as I then understood it.I was driven to increasing levels of sexual frustration, made all the more cripplingby my reluctance to harness such energies in service to my Enochian work, and myconviction that somehow failing to do so, violating the principles of “chastity” as I thenunderstood them, would lead to some imagined magical hell and damnation, vaguely24"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"modeled on that learned as a child. Moreover, I was deeply terrified of losing Susan.Jones had told me that as a result of his involvement with the spirits, Dee had losthis wife to Edward Kelly, when they ran offtogether, and left the old wizard alone. Ibecame convinced a similar fate awaited me. It was only recently, upon finally readingDee’s personal diaries for myself, that I learned Jones’s assertion was utter rubbish. JackParsons appears to have thought this story to be true as well, for reasons unknown, andI now suspect that it was from Jack’s letters to Marjorie Cameron that Jones had cometo accept this myth as fact. But at the time, I trusted David’s knowledge of the materialwithout question, and suffered accordingly.By January, I was openly questioning the validity of the Caliphate, steadfastly re-fusing to seek advancement beyond thei◦, yet still very much involved in affairs atThelema Lodge. On 3 February, I awoke from a dream of “156”. I had no idea whatit meant at the time. Later, on the night of 8 March, I dreamt of a fierce battle, oneboth physical and magical. My wife and I were involved, as was most everyone weknew in the Caliphate. At some point I escaped alone, and sent a locomotive packedwith explosives back into the fray, resulting in general devastation and heavy casualtieson all sides. Even in my dreams, I was breaking with the Order, yet refusing to justsimply walk away. Susan and I were fighting almost continuously by this time, mostlyover our involvement with the A...A..., only gaining some respite when she agreed topostpone her further pursuit of the matter until after I had completed my Probation.In retrospect, it is clear that I no longer entertained any desire to proceed even that far,though what I believed at the time is no longer clear.25"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"VThe student, if he attains any success in the following practices, will find himself con-fronted by things (ideas or beings) too glorious or too dreadful to be described.

Jones had developed an interest inMayan calendrics, and had discovered that the first of the eighteen “months” of theiryear had been calledPop, same as the 19thÆthyr, which we had failed to open theprevious November. By his calculations, the first day of the new year,0Pop, coincidedwith new moon on 26 March. The opportunity was too good to pass up, and it wasdecided that we should attempt once more to gain entrance to the æthyr on that date.This time would not be a small closed affair as it was in the Haight, but a group effortinvolving several people, Clay Holden among them. The 19thwas important, not justto us as a goal that had frustrated our previous effort, but because it was here that theHoly Tablewas commended to Crowley for further study in 1909, as recorded inTheVision and the Voice. It was this mysterious aspect that had roused Clay’s interest. Suchcuriosity may easily be forgiven, even lauded, but a little serious forethought aboutwhat the satisfaction of that curiosity might entail would have better prepared him forthe experience. Susan, David, Oberon, and myself knew full well this was not going tobe easy, and though Holden was present when we discussed the difficulties involved,what was said never seems to have made an impression.In preparation for the proposed operation, what in many ways was to be our mostambitious yet, Susan and I opened the 21stÆthyr on 23 April, followed by the 20thÆthyr the day after that. Stung by our failure in November, we were very keen to ex-pend every possible effort in making this latest attempt a success. In keeping with thespirit of restoring Enochian evocation to its original form as recorded by Dee, freed asmuch as possible of the excrescences of the Golden Dawn and other latter-day inter-pretations, we were now using a different method to summon the Governors of a givenæthyr than that used in Santa Cruz the year before. The “square working” techniquewas abandoned altogether, and in its place we began using the method suggested to26"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"Dee by the angels themselves. Each Governor has one of twelve angels set over them,which in turn are associated with one of the twelve tribes of the children of Israel.These angels are mentioned inRevelation, in St John the Divine’s vision of the NewJerusalem. Ruling over each of these is one of the seven archangels, the seven thatstand in the divine presence, the letters of whose names are found in the outermostheptagon of theSigillum Dei Æmeth.Dee had used the works of Cornelius Agrippa as a near constant guide in inter-preting the material presented to him. Following his example, the particular sign ofthe Zodiac associated with the angel set over a given Governor, and thus the planetaryruler and archangel of each, was determined by cross-referencing the name of the tribegiven in Dee’sLiber Scientiæ, Auxilii, et Victoriæ Terrestriswith that found in Agrippa.In November, we had learned our original approach had been too heavy, too material.This latest technique, using time and space instead of the elements to summon theGovernors, seemed exactly what was needed.Back in February, I had been asked to banish the planets before Mass at the Lodge.Despite having some time to prepare myself in advance of the ceremony, I found myselfutterly incapable of doing so, suffering a near nervous collapse when faced with thefact I was incapable of meeting David’s expectations. My work to date had centeredprimarily on the Watchtowers, neglecting planetary forms of magick altogether. Sincethen, my time was spent learning and perfecting this new skill, studying the processin depth, along with the intricacies of Dee and Kelly’sSigillum Dei Æmeth, and thesystem of planetary hours. Under Jones’s instruction, I was departing rather radicallyfrom the traditional Golden Dawn methods. Initiates of the Inner Order were taughtto simply face the quarter in which the planet being invoked or banished was thenlocated when drawing the appropriate symbols and vibrating the associated names,and this was deemed sufficient. Crowley was silent on the matter in hisLiber O, butinLiber IOD, he instructed the Adept to “face the actual position of each planet inthe heavens at the time of his working”. Inspired by Dee, David was introducing aserious astronomical element into the technique, adopting this later refinement, andinterpreting it strictly.For us, it was no longer adequate to face the proper quarter and wave a sword inthe general direction of the planet. We now insisted on calculating the precise altitudeand azimuth for a given heavenly body at the projected time of operation. Withoutcheating, and using one of several widely available astronomical software packages,27"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"it was a lot of work. But as many of us learn sooner or later, there are no expedientshortcuts in magick.On Sunday, 25 March, I drove us to Thelema Lodge, where we spent the eveningplanning and preparing for the next day’s ritual. Late that night, we departed Oaklandfor the home of John Oberon, in Orinda, a small village in the mountains east of SanFrancisco. Oberon had volunteered the use of his parent’s home for the operation—they being away for an extended period of time—partly because he had participatedin the failed attempt some months earlier, and partly because he steadfastly refused tobelieve there was anything we could conjure into his environment he could not handle.Arriving at that beautiful and luxurious home, perched high upon a steep hillside, Icompleted my calculations to fix the locations of the planets for dawn, and for newmoon at 11:49am, Pacific Standard Time.David and I erected a makeshift astronomical observatory on the terrace behindthe house in the hours before first light, under the brilliantly glittering stars, far fromthe glaring street lamps of the Bay Area, using and demonstrating for the first timetechniques I had developed during the previous weeks. Clay Holden was present, aswas Caitlin and her then lover, John Golding, who had brought along a replica ofDee’sHoly Tablehe had recently constructed. When all was in order and in place, Ishould have been apprehensive, but wasn’t. In the days and weeks prior to the event,I had come to face most of my known fears, and looking ahead at what lay before us, acurious calm had possessed me, affording total immersion in the work at hand.Dawn crept across the mountains to the east, and we began easing our way into the19th. David banished, and we both read the 1stKey, he in English, and I in Enochian.After 11:00am, Susan and I recited Dee’s “Fundamental Obeisance”, which I followedby erecting a skeletal version of the Watchtowers. Holden and Anne Hanley did the2ndEnochian Key, and Golding’sHoly Tablewas moved outside, into the by now bril-liant California sunlight. David banished the planets, among other things, then readthe Call of the 19thÆthyr, and at its conclusion, I myself summoned all three of itsGovernors. What followed is rather difficult to describe, and I admit that even now thebare facts of the experience are none too easily pieced together into some semblance ofa coherent narrative.We began to wander, alone or in small groups. Observing quietly what was hap-pening, Jones sat down and rummaged through his things, soon producing a brickof charcoal, assorted odds and ends, and what at first glance appeared to be incense.28"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"I asked what he was doing, and he said we seemed to be having a little “possessionproblem”. He went on to explain that some demons, particularly those of a Saturniannature, tended to be attracted to the smell of burning sulfur. His intent was to setsome alight, and see who among us was attracted to the noxious fumes. Jones kindledthe charcoal, placed upon it a small quantity of the substance, and sat back to wait.Immediately, Clay and John Golding walked over, and sat down beside him.“David,” Golding began, with Holden looking on with an expression of seriousconcern even more dour than usual, “I think we have a problem”.“You do?” he replied. The hellish fumes now drifted through the open room, yetneither of his interrogators seemed to notice.“I believe you are possessed”, said Golding, in the grave tone usually reserved byphysicians for telling a patient of their impending demise.“Oh you do, do you?” David replied, casting an “I told you so” glance in my direc-tion. His eyes danced, and he seemed barely capable of concealing the amused ironyin his voice. There followed an argument that was to last for hours, in one form or an-other. It wasn’t heated by any means, as Golding was far too cold a fish for that. Passionof any kind wasn’t in him, at least in my experience. It was rather an endless repetitionof “David, we have to close this down.” “No, that isn’t necessary.” “Why, David?” andassorted variations on that theme. It was maddening in the extreme, and when theyfailed to convince either Jones or myself, they changed fronts in their campaign, andattempted an appeal to Susan’s sensibilities instead. Neither of them was sufficientlyintelligent to realize that in order to channel the space we had invoked, she was aboutas farout thereas she could get, without actually speaking in tongues with her headrevolving on her shoulders like a merry-go-round. The clueless duo had forgotten ornever noticed the hours of preparation to which she had submitted herself, in order tocreate the state of quiet and passive acceptance that now possessed her.It was odd to walk into a room, and find two earnest individuals, however out oftheir minds, doggedly attempting to convince one’s wife that her husband had obvi-ously gone mad, and if she wished to save her life, she must depart with them at once.Susan looked up at me and smiled, and continued to explain in a calm voice, drenchedwith pity and concern, that she was in no danger, and neither were they. For my part, Ieyed them both with cold contempt, tempered but slightly by the comedy of the situ-ation. They looked at me with surprised fear at being discovered so soon and so easily,but quickly regained their composure and resumed their plea.29"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"Was David possessed? Was I? In my journal that afternoon I wrote, “Maybe”, butsitting here with the perspective that twelve intervening years affords, I would amendthat to read, “Most assuredly”. But what should one reasonably expect? The three ofus—David, Susan, and myself—had expended many hours of effort over several days,pouring all we had and summoning all we could in order to accomplish what just a fewmonths before had been essentially impossible. David had banished everything thatcould be banished, and I had invoked the three Governors into the void thus created.In our everyday mode of existence, we were not capable of controlling the forces andcurrents of the 19thÆthyr. That is the point of summoning those three whose office itis to do just that. In the hours of insanity that stretched from that afternoon long intothe evening, nothing happened that either surprised or discomfited the three of us, andfar from finding the situation disturbing, we seemed to be rather enjoying it. That, tomy mind, is sufficient proof that our methods were sound—at least theoretically.The extent of Golding’s experience was summoning a spirit and commanding thatit do his bidding, and to the best of my knowledge, based upon his assessment of thesituation, Clay’s magical background was essentially nil. His sole interest was, as I laterlearned, to appear more appealing in the eyes of both his girlfriend—April Dawn, whofound Enochian magick increasingly sexy, and him less so with each passing day—andSusan, for whom Holden had developed a schoolboy infatuation that would last until Iwas safely out of the way, when she told him point blank she had no romantic interestin his aging frame whatsoever.To his credit, Golding rallied what knowledge he had, principally of Goëtic work,and misapplying that to the present situation as best he could, attempted to reasonwith the demon he had convinced both himself and Clay now possessed Jones.“What is it you want?” he asked, attempting to bribe David into closing the æthyras soon as possible.“Peace on Earth.”“I can’t give you that. What do you want that I can give you?”“Yes, you can”, David replied heatedly, “I don’t want a lot of it. Just a cube: threefeet, by three feet, by three feet. One minute, of Peace on Earth at 3:33”, a time thenrapidly approaching. With those words dying in the air, all hell broke lose.Those of us who were still in possession of some shred of self-control sat in silencearound theHoly Table, while the others shouted and argued, surging around us likesome storm tossed sea of rage and fear. Needless to say, 3:33 came and went amidst a30"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"cacophony that would wake the dead. At one point they were actually tearing at oneanother, wrestling on the floor, screeching and howling like banshees. Never have Iseen anything like it, before or since. At some point in the free for all, Caitlin, withgreat fanfare, and over the protests of the others, “parted the veil”, walked out of thehouse, and down the mountain in search of sanctuary. It was stupid, and unfortunate,and exposed her to far more immediate dangers than any she believed she faced withus. We would learn some days later that she thumbed a ride back to Oakland, andpresented herself, shaken and strung-out, at the door of Ebony Anpu. He soaked herin a tub of nitre for a while, reinforced her belief in how irresponsible we were, andthankfully set her more or less to right.As the long afternoon faded into twilight, their efforts left them exhausted, andsomething approaching calm settled over the group. David, after a tarot reading, andsome discussion amongst the three of us, decided enough was enough, announcingsomething should be done to stop this thing, to detach ourselves from whatever it wasthat held us in its hellish thrall. We showered, and I was dispatched to find Goldingand Clay, and instruct them to bathe, a thing of utmost importance under the cir-cumstances, to remove as much as possible any physical basis to which any lingeringinfluences might remain attached.I found them easily enough, still conspiring in the living room. If I have any causefor regret over that day’s events and my part in them, it is the manner in which Ichose to impress upon those two the gravity of the situation, and the necessity for theirfollowing instructions. “If you value your lives”, I began, “you will go take a showerimmediately”. There was probably a more tactful way of putting it, but given the day’sevents and the potential danger we faced, to say nothing of the profound disregardin which I held them both by that time, it conveyed my meaning succinctly, and notwithout a sense of humor, or so I supposed. Clay characteristically mistook my state-ment as a personal threat of violence, and immediately assumed his most comicallybelligerent stance. Golding, just as typically, blinked twice, and asked, “Why do wehave to take a shower?” There are few things quite as wearisome as attempting tosatisfy the curiosity of a clod, but I maintained my composure, and refusing to partici-pate in this latest round of pig-headed questioning, rephrased and repeated my demanduntil they reluctantly and suspiciously complied.All of us newly refreshed and squeaky clean, David closed the space in the mannerthat we would normally have prepared to open it, by reading the 7thand 8thEnochian31"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"Keys, before finally banishing using theStar Ruby. That night, while the others layfast asleep, Jones, Susan, and myself sat in silence around theHoly Table, just as wehad earlier that day, and at exactly 3:33am, it happened: hovering over the table, andindeed reigning all around us, Peace on Earth, or at least some limited portion of it—three feet, by three feet, by three feet, to be exact—was ours. To this day, it stands outin my mind as the most sublime of moments, a fleeting glimpse of that eternal peacewhich surely passeth all understanding.By dawn, I alone remained awake, and after greeting the Sun withReshout on theterrace, I roused Susan and we made our way home, collapsing until nightfall. Theresults of our work in Orinda came swiftly, and it took varied and surprising forms,but one consistent theme ran through them all.Schism, is perhaps the best way to putit, or in the language of catastrophe theory we were soon to learn,bifurcation. Thehead of theAncient Mystical Order Rosæ Crucis[amorc] went public with his beliefthat Dee had been instrumental in the creation of the Rosicrucian movement, in a fullpage magazine advertisement, and his order promptly split. Clay and April dissolvedtheir relationship, as did others of our acquaintance soon after. A meeting was held atThelema Lodge, while David Jones was away, between the lawyer who would bringsuit against the Berkeley Police department for their raid of the Lodge some monthsbefore, and the prospective plaintiffs. In a belated attempt to appear respectable inthe eyes of an outsider, a whirlwind cleaning spree was undertaken, in which some ofDavid’s personal effects, including his boots and the paperwork for his student loan,were thoughtlessly thrown away.When David returned and discovered his loss, he went absolutely ballistic. He pas-sionately abhorred lawyers anyway, and with Jim Graeb before him as a near constantreminder, one could hardly blame him. Jones was convinced the original guidelinesof the Order, as laid down and published by Crowley, were sufficient for resolving allconflicts between Brothers, or should at the very least be deemed sufficient until fullyimplemented and proven otherwise. Since this was obviously a matter between him-self, Graeb, Trina and the rest, it was in essence a strictly internal affair, and should behandled accordingly. Despite the fact that he had suffered at the hands of the policeas much if not more so than anyone else arrested on that fateful September night, hesteadfastly refused on principal to take part in any proposed legal action, especially inlight of the fact that the Order was making no signs of moving against the knownperpetrators of the incident. The upper echelon saw only the opportunity to vindicate32"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"themselves in the eyes of an uncaring public, and were salivating at the prospect ofhaving their day in court.Some well-placed members of the Caliphate, in their rush to uphold the party line,later claimed Jones was “obviously losing his mind”, even going so far as to blameJones’s cavalier attitude toward Trina and her machinations for the raid itself. This ishardly surprising, since at least one of these pundits benefitted greatly from the affair,assuming the role of Lodge Master after David’s departure. The simple truth is thatJones was outraged, and justifiably so, that legal action on the part of the Order wasdeemed more desirable than honoring the personal wishes and property of a Man anda Brother, even when that Brother was both directly involved and Master of ThelemaLodge. The toadies who bravely stepped forward to carp after the fact were obviouslyin no position to judge one way or the other, given that unlike myself, their know-ledge of Jones’s motivations was based on rumor and hearsay, and deeply prejudiced bytheir relationship to those who hold their leash, to whom they owed both their swornallegiance and their position of favor within the Order.Though I was none the worse for my experiences in the 19th, I was certainly nobetter. David suggested I undertake a more formal regimen of planetary banishingsin the days that followed, in order to gain more effective and practical control overmy confused and frustrated emotional state. To this end, on 9 April 1990, I began anextensive series of planetary workings that would continue in one form or another formany weeks to follow. For five days running, beginning on that Monday, I opened withthe rituals of theStar RubyandStar Sapphire, and banished the seven planets in turn,plus Terra, using the appropriate unicursal hexagram and Hebrew godname, followedby an invocation of the archangel of each. This ritual was performed in one of thefour hours ruled by the planet associated with that particular day, chosen such that thecelestial body in question was above the horizon at the time.On day number six, arising from an inexplicably sleepless and sweat-soaked night,I repaired to the Temple, and lit a black candle in the north. Banishing using theStar RubyandStar Sapphireas before, I waited for Saturn’s time of transit that firstSaturn hour of Saturday, and at the precise moment the planet crossed the meridian,I banished it, and invoked its archangel,Zaphkiel. The next day, I banished Sol andinvokedRaphaelat dawn, with a red candle in the east this time, followed by a shortprayer for healing, of my tattered psyche and of my relationship with Susan. I thenbanished Mercury and invoked the archangelMichael, in the third hour, later that33"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"same morning. My journal of the time records this fact before going silent for morethan twenty-four hours, until the afternoon of Monday, 16 April. We had stopped bythe house to shower and grab a bite to eat on our way to Santa Cruz, when I hastilyjotted down a sketchy account of recent events.Sunday afternoon, David had called, and asked us to meet him atThe Gates of Hell,in the sculpture garden at Stanford University, fifteen minutes or so from our home.We arrived to find him standing before that hauntingly beautiful and massive piece,with a cigarette dangling from his lip and his perpetually disheveled and mismatchedclothing flapping about him in a warm spring breeze. There, in the blazing afternoonsun, with a bronze and pensive Rodin staring down at us from high above the imposingdoors of Tartarus, Jones read the 18thEnochian Key, and the Call of the 9thÆthyr,which is calledzip. Gone now were the days of incense and robes, of tables and squaresand all the accumulated detritus of traditional western ceremonial work. The world wasour Temple, furnished with whatever lay readily to hand, and though the casual passer-by, observing what was done that day, would have noticed nothing especially out of theordinary, the effect was to be nothing of the sort.The three of us eventually journeyed across the Bay, via the Dumbarton Bridge,not far from our home, and proceeded north along twenty-two miles of the NimitzExpressway to Oakland and Thelema Lodge. Clay was there, with news of a professorof mathematics atucsc, who was very much interested in meeting David and theces.We sat up late discussing the matter after Mass, and slept that night on the floor ofHorus Temple. Early the following afternoon, we left for Mountain View, Santa Cruz,and the Caffe Pergolesi, at 418 Cedar St. David and his now girlfriend, Anne Hanley,had already arrived, as had Clay, and we were soon joined by Prof Ralph Abraham.Dr Abraham is a mathematician of some note, and considered by many to be oneof the fathers of modern chaos theory. Sitting at a patio table, he explained to us overcappuccinos and lattes that he had developed an interest in Dee as one of the notablemathematicians of his day. Dee’s introduction to the first English edition of Euclidhad prompted Abraham to acquire the three volume Dover edition ofThe Elements,the same text that David had introduced to those of us in theces. He related how heworked through the first book with ease, as he remembered much of it from his schooldays. The second however, was somewhat problematic. The proofs and constructionswere not that terribly dense, but it was becoming increasingly difficult to determineprecisely where Euclid was headed. By the third book, however, Dr Abraham admitted34"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"finding the math a bit overwhelming as well, and it struck him with great force thatnot only did men like Dee understand the geometry itself, but understood its intent aswell. David explained, in his turn, how he had taken up theElementsbecause of Dee,having become convinced one could not fully understand Dee’s system without it. Hehad reached much the same impasse, but from a different point of departure. It seemedobvious to both parties that we had each taken up opposite ends of the same thread,and following where it led, had met in the middle, here, at the Caffe Pergolesi.It had been exactly a year and a day since we had our littleEnochian D&Dsession,opening the 22ndÆthyr as a group in April’s apartment. As a matter of fact, it hadbeen a year and a day since we had met at this very café. April, Clay’s ex-girlfriend,was a student atucsc, and was now enrolled in Abraham’s class on the history ofmathematics, this year with some emphasis placed on the life and work of John Dee.She had told him about our demonstration, and now he was very much interestedin our little group performing something similar for the benefit of his class. To say wewere thrilled is an understatement, and a little intimidated as well. There was also sometalk of establishing what was to beThe John Dee Society, a non-profit enterprise set upexplicitly for the publication and dissemination of the Enochian corpus, complete withpotential grants to fund our efforts, and possibly to include full-time employment forone or two primaries.Naturally, we believed that Dee should be considered one of the greater lights ofhis age. Most of us sitting there at 418 Cedar, David and myself included, had beenstudying the works and ideas of Dame Frances Yates, and her re-interpretation ofDee’s contribution to history. Jones first introduced me to her books sometime theyear before, fundamentally changing the way I looked at the man and his work forever.In essence, she was one of the first main-stream historians to state the obvious, thatthe sage of Mortlake was no fool, as history had erroneously assumed for so long.Moreover, she was also the first to note that after his passing, Rosicrucianism hadsprung up like mushrooms after a warm rain, across the same swath of the Continentover which Dee and Kelly wandered for so many years. If she is correct—and I for onebelieve she is—then it casts their mission on behalf of God and His divine purpose in adecidedly different light. Her research appeared solid and well received by the academiccommunity, and therefore provided ample justification for our belief that to study Deeand his Enochian system was to study not only one of the seminal influences on thedevelopment of Hermetic thought, but the origins of most modern occult societies as35"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"well, esoteric Freemasonry and theotoincluded. As you will soon see, our enthusiasmwas not shared in all quarters among our peers.Later that afternoon, as we sat at Orbit One, the Caliphate encampment that wasthe apartment of April Dawn, we discussed the day’s events and their apparent import,basking in the glow of our success and good fortune. David and I seemed to be oflike mind. We kept rubbing our eyes and blinking, attempting to determine if whatappeared to have formed around us was real, or just a product of our hopeful imagina-tion. It seemed solid enough, however many ways we squinted at what was happening,and on the strength of that observation we agreed to pursue this thing, imaginary ornot, as far as it might take us. All was in place to accomplish something of lasting andmeaningful value with respect to our work. In Orbit One, we had a group of manage-able size, which was willing and dedicated to pursue Enochian research, mercifully freefrom the politics, infighting, and petty intrigues that had come to characterize life atThelema Lodge. Until now, David’s work had been published as monthly installmentsin the Thelema Lodge newsletter. It was solid scholarly research, the beginnings of adetailed transcription and analysis of the Dee material, starting withLiber PrimusoftheMysteriorum Libri. Now, after talking with Dr Abraham, we were looking at thepossibility of wider exposure and an air of legitimacy, in a climate that welcomed andaccepted our efforts. It was an alluring prospect, unsought, yet most desirable now thatit presented itself.After an excitedly sleepless night, in which April and myself banished Luna andinvoked Gabriel in the tenth hour, David and I found ourselves in the front row withthe others from Orbit One, attending Prof Abraham’s lecture. After Jones was intro-duced to the class, he allowed himself a quick look around the auditorium. Suddenly,he sucked air, and sliding down in his seat hissed to me that two of our weightierbrethren were sitting at the back of the hall. When the lecture concluded, I glancedinto the crowd behind us, and indeed they were, staring icy daggers in our direction asthey stood to leave. But before I could say anything to David, he had thrown himself atthe stage door, and without so much as a backward glance he was gone, fast as a briskwalk could take him. It is difficult to say which surprised and confused me the most,but not allowing either to get the better of me, I caught up before he had crossed thepavement outside. That they were there at all was puzzling, but not as much as Jones’ssprint to place as much distance between us and them as possible. He apparently knewwhat it meant, something best avoided, but that realization for me was yet to come.36"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"Our Brothers, the ones that had frightened him so, had seats in the “by invitationonly” section of the Caliphate, as did Jones himself. Both had made scholarly contribu-tions to the Order’s work in the past, so at first glance, it might have seemed reasonablethese two heavies should attend Abraham’s class. Obviously, Jones’s behavior suggestedotherwise. There are two possible reasons why he bolted from the auditorium thatafternoon. One will be revealed in due course, and the other had to do with occultpolitics. Some of our little group had watched and applauded while the head ofamorcpublicly credited John Dee with significant influence on the Rosicrucian movement,apparently based on the ideas advanced by Frances Yates. For all intents and purposes,that organization ejected him soon after. The theory that circulated among us, as towhy the one thing might necessarily follow the other, led to concerns about our ownactions in Santa Cruz. It had to do with an organization founded by Paul Foster Case,theBuilders of the Adytum.37"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"VIMy criticism of this part of thegdwork is: (First) that it emanated so largely from Kelly;(Second) That the tablets are part of a rigmarole by which Kelly persuaded Dee thatthey two were to be the puppet-masters of a new European political order which shouldsupersede the kingdoms then reigning; (Third) That the same angel who dictated theTablets also required that Kelly and Dee should have all things in common, includingtheir wives; (Fourth) That the whole project came to the same ignominious end that isto be expected of human undertakings based upon the promises of spirits; (Fifth) Thatthere is no good reason to suppose that Kelly and Dee, or their enterprise, to say nothingof their magic, correspond to anything Rosicrucian; (Six, and most important) That Ihave personal knowledge of more than twenty-five instances where the performance ofmagical operations based on Order formulae led to serious disintegrations of mind orbody. . . Perhaps the most conspicuous example of the unfortunate consequences of theuse of these formulas is Aleister Crowley himself; but there are plenty of others. . .Paul Foster Case, letter to Israel Regardie, 10 August 1933Case was a member of the Golden Dawn, but deeply opposed to Enochian magick.His reasons were part misunderstanding, part prejudice, and based on assumptions hemade without access to certain information possessed only by initiates of a relativelyadvanced grade. The founder of theBuilders of the Adytum[bota] was expelled beforebeing entrusted with these secrets, and even if Case had not made such gross errorsof fact, he was still not qualified to judge his observations from an initiated stand-point. After parting ways with the Golden Dawn, not only did he expunge all thingsEnochian from the teachings of his new and improved organization and its rites, buteven went so far as to declare Dee’s angelic system afalse doctrine. What goes on in an-other’s occult order would ordinarily have been none of our concern, butbotamemberswere not uncommonly found in the ranks of other organizations. They have a curiousrelationship with the Caliphate. Degree candidates in the latter face no restrictions re-garding their affiliations with other groups, and thus someone who has been admittedtobotamay rise to the very top of the Caliphate’s hierarchy, should they be invitedto do so. There is no reciprocal arrangement. Consequently, it arises that anyone whoenjoys admittance to both orders answers to superiors inbotabut not necessarily inthe Caliphate. Bill Heidrick had been a member ofbotaat one time, and it was be-lieved there were others within our order, in numbers and power unknown. Logically,38"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"it seemed reasonable to assume a cross membership betweenbotaandamorcas well,and to us this seemed the most obvious explanation for the split.By prior arrangement, we all met at the Whole Earth Café after that first class,a small campus dining facility nestled on the side of a ravine among the redwoods.David and Dr Abraham continued their Enochian discussion, and the conversationnaturally turned to angels. The professor admitted this was his principal interest inus, even suggesting that Jones himself might be one. Despite his shock at such anoutlandish statement, David retained his composure and asked what would lead himto such a conclusion. The answer was simple and surprising: he could see his wings.When asked just how many wings he saw, Abraham said he counted six. David laterconfessed he believed the man was serious, and that in a flash of insight, he had seenhimself surrounded by the six of us, hiswings, just as Dr Abraham described them.Had he claimed to see two wings, his statement might have been easily dismissed, butsix was significant. This is exactly how the four cherubs which surround the throne ofthe divine presence are described inRevelation, and indeed this is how they are figuredon the Watchtowers as well. It was, Jones claimed, one of most frightening momentsof his life.It was agreed that David would present a lecture to the class on the work of JohnDee, from a practical, magical standpoint insofar as it was understood by him, and thathe and others of theceswould demonstrate our research methods in the auditorium,to be followed at some future date by something more involved in another venue. Toactually present ourselves before a large number of people—even Santa Cruz people—and practice our weird science in front of God and everyone seemed insane. Even ifthe in-class presentation would not include dropping an æthyr, it would still be typicalof our work, and lay bare our magical world to the great unwashed. Obviously, thewhole affair had got a little out of hand by now, exhilarating and terrifying by turns,but after the events that plagued Thelema Lodge in recent months, our way seemedall too clear. Three days after our first meeting with Dr Abraham, in a small and veryinformal ceremony at Orbit One, theceswas officially relocated to April’s apartmenton Seabright Ave, in Santa Cruz.Seems a small and insignificant thing, and had any outsider been present thatafternoon they surely would have agreed, but in this case in particular, looks couldbe deceiving. There were lots of ongoing activities at Thelema Lodge, monthly classestaught by Bill Heidrick and others, various reading and study groups, Mass every week,39"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"and the diverse activities that revolved around the sacred calendar. None were as signif-icant as thecesin my eyes, and even the A...A..., which movedunseenin their midst,paled in comparison to the work. The classes, parties, and sundry social events wereoften pleasant and even important in their own right, in maintaining a sense of com-munity so long as it had lasted. But David and theceswere actually attempting to dosomething new, to present material and related research to the occult community thatuntil that time had scarcely seen the light of day. Our success in Santa Cruz the yearbefore had sparked rivalries, and to pull out of the Lodge, especially in the midst of thefurore of the pending court case against the Berkeley police, was a political statementin the eyes of our superiors, a vote of no confidence not easily overlooked.For all my anger and resentment, I meant no harm by walking away. It was not revo-lutionary, or rebellious in that way at all. As a result of our new prospects, I washappy,for the first time in ages, and could not care less what anyone thought. How they per-ceived my actions was not my concern. Despite our devotion to theegc, even Mass atThelema Lodge had become an exceedingly tiresome affair. Along with the resentmentover Bill Breeze’s draconian ecclesiastic reforms, Caitlin had largely withdrawn fromher oversight of the Sunday evening service. She no longer coordinated Mass at theLodge, partly due to her spending an increasing amount of time with her chosen andpreferred, and in part due to other females at the Lodge taking over some of her for-mer responsibilities, though sadly lacking her sense of reverence for the service itself.To make matters worse, some individuals were now taking great pride in presentingparodies of the Mass on Sunday evenings, ostensibly in protest of the newly enactedreforms. Generally speaking, these were rather sophomoric affairs, accomplishing littlemore than attracting attention to their creators, for good or for ill. With such fare, it issmall wonder that we three found it easy to turn our backs on Horus Temple.The Lodge was falling apart, or rather being torn apart. This had been going onfor at least seven months now; we had fought and resisted, but largely on our own. Intimes past, we were free to discreetly use the Mass to promote the work of the Lodge.Now, in that spring of 1990, if we altered the Mass, however subtly, we were no longerfree to call itTheGnostic Mass. When we finally succeeded in opening the 19th, and Isat before theHoly Tablewith David and Susan that night in Orinda, I learned a simpletruth about my world and those around me: the three of us could do something otherscouldn’t, but we couldn’t do it at the Lodge. In a profound metaphysical sense, theOrder was our mother, and our concubine, and the Lodge was that organ of her body40"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"with which we were most intimate. The time had come to pull out. In the 9thÆthyr, inthat space in which I moved and lived and had my being, this was all crystalline clear.The most worrisome detail for me at the time was David repeating this was all myfault. I did it; I was doing it, and he was just along for the ride. Or so he claimed.It was unnerving, even in jest, but did not wholly stop me from enjoying the ridemyself. Odd really, thinking about it now, but it all seemed perfectly normal under thecircumstances. I had indeed beseeched the blessed angels for aid and succor in my timeof need, and so far as I could tell, they had not disappointed. Susan would continue towork at Stanford for the time being, while I established myself and our work in SantaCruz. She and the cats would soon follow, and the breathing space afforded us in themeantime would do us both good. The future was bright, and she seemed pleased.With the Order and the A...A... and all that swirled around them now receding intothe background, the work was now drawing the two of us together towards a sharedgoal, not driving a wedge between us as before. David was even talking about Mexico,and a desire for he and Anne to study Mayan archaeological sites firsthand. Much asit pains me now, I have to admit not being at all displeased at the suggestion. Thingswere going quite well indeed.The 22ndÆthyr was largely manageable and informative, the first time round theyear before. In the 21stÆthyr, I had seen he that sitteth upon the throne, and saw thatpitiable thing as myself. Indeed, all too often I was blind to that which I had created,and was actively creating around me, yet suffered from its invisible presence just thesame. In the 20th, I met the Lamb, my deceiver, and in the 19th, for the most fleetingof moments, I found my way to the center of the wheel. In that stillness, in whichthe blind terror could get no hold, I had caught a glimpse of that which lies beyondthis mundane existence. Now, in the 9th, I could see this thing around me and to someextent, interact with it. It was heavenly, and I lived quite literally in a continuous stateof bliss. We were all sitting on the deck at the Whole Earth Café one afternoon,and Susan caught David’s eye, glanced at me, and tapping a finger in the center of herforehead smiled with approval. It was immediately obvious what she meant. I couldsee,and not just phantoms in a lesser crystalline sphere. She knew it, and David noddedhappily, “I know, I know. He’s been that way for a while.”I wandered in this wondrous world, mostly with Jones, moving back and forthbetween Mountain View and Santa Cruz, at all hours of the day and night, whileregularly attending Dr Abraham’s class on Tuesday and Thursday afternoons. On the41"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"remaining five days of the week, I continued my new clockwork astronomical regi-men, relaxing and socializing at home and Orbit One for brief periods in between. Adate was set to open the 22ndÆthyr for Dr Abraham and his class, as per an oraclereceived by Susan on Wednesday, 25 April, mere hours before she lost her balance andsprained her ankle before theGates of Hell. On 27 April, the phone started ringing,calls from people at the Lodge mostly, all wanting to talk to David. By 1 May, wehad set up an “ auxiliary” Temple in our dining room, and began casting a blank ofrefined beeswax, twenty-seven inches round, and somewhat more, to be carved intoaSigillum Dei Æmeth. The following night, while Golding slept on our sofa, Susan,Jones and myself opened the 8thÆthyr, which is calledzid, and reading the 26thCallin Enochian we paused at the wordMadriiax,while Oberon, Laura Chandler, and herpartner walked through the living room door.Preparations were underway for our in-class demonstration, and later that night,just before dawn, I rode with Oberon to the North Bay. It is almost frightening torecall that his driving didn’t disturb me in the slightest. He could half-turn in his seattalking to me, light a cigarette, change cassette tapes while consulting their cases, andnegotiate four lanes of traffic at over eighty miles per hour, all at the same time andwithout obvious difficulty. The uncanny part of it was how perfectly at ease I was,trusting his skill and judgment without question. In those few casually mind-blowinghours, it was my intent to sell him on our great good fortune, inviting him to join us ifhe would. Oberon politely agreed to see for himself, and we caught up with the othersat Dr Abraham’s class that afternoon.When David Jones had concluded a superb lecture, brief though it was due to theconstraint of time, the house lights were dimmed and he asked the large audience toplease remain quiet, to just watch the glass sphere, set on a tripod center stage. All saveJones who performed that day were wearing their black robes, and April opened ourceremony by banishing with the Lesser Ritual of the Pentagram. Behind her, beyondthe glare of the lights, as she turned and vibrated, and turned again, I could see littleof those who watched, but could feel their presence, their silent attention fixed andunbroken upon us. David performed theStar Sapphire, and read Dee’s “FundamentalObeisance”, while Golding erected the Twelve Banners. There followed the 1stKey,the English translation read by David, and the Enochian by me, in a black top hatwreathed in ivy. “Everyone loves Papa Legba”, Jones later said. After a long and utterlysilent pause, David closed with theStar Ruby. Several of us later agreed we had actually42"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"seen the spirits coming down to the sphere, like brightly glowing sparks, or fireflies,descending to the smooth, glistening surface before mounting upward again, like motesdancing in the eye of God.Jones suggested the sheer force of attention of so many people was sufficient toprevent any creature from entering the glass itself, despite the fact he specificallyinstructed those present not to focus intently on the sphere. Everyone was respect-ful of our group, and of our craft, and most seemed genuinely impressed—with theexception of Oberon, though even he was generally positive in his remarks. Unlike thestudents, he had seen us do that much and far more in private session, and after walk-ing around in my world for a day, he offered his opinion without mincing words. “It’san illusion”, he said, and with that and a friendly smile, he left us to our own designs.Over the next several days, my journal is once again massively fragmented, with avague account of an ad hoc ceremony by Susan, David, and myself, using a found stickfor a wand, in the forest behind theucsccampus. Though I was no longer as happy asI had been in the 9th, things were still going relatively well. The following Monday, 7May 1990, Mordecai Shapiro and Bill Heidrick both called my home, both demandingto speak to David, four weeks to the day after I began my planetary work. When helearned it was Bill, Jones signaled to Anne, and they vanished through the front doorwith a frantic backward wave, lest I should lie, and say he wasn’t there. After their exit,Heidrick and I talked for longer than expected, much of it punctuated with repetitionsof, “I mean, this is just egregious”. David was being accused of absconding with therent money at the Lodge, which it was claimed he collected and never paid. The placewas in an uproar, and this was just the beginning. At the time, I am not sure whether Ibelieved the accusation or not, but I was certain he was presumed guilty regardless. Forme, it was all part of a broader pattern, for by then I had heard the rumor, the one youmay or may not recall, that of theBlack Lodge of Santa Cruz. Some now believed themoney was merely a side issue, and the real fly in the Order’s oatmeal was the Masterof Thelema Lodge moving himself and a piece of intellectual property to a locationvaguely outside of the Order’s control. I laughed out loud when first I heard it, as didDavid with me. To those in the rarefied and shadowy realms above us, all this businesswas no laughing matter, apparently not by any stretch of the imagination.On Wednesday, David banished Mercury and I Sol, in the courtyard of my homein Mountain View, a lovely space, and still one of my favorites. It was surrounded bya high wall, overgrown with ivy, and pierced in three places by doorways: one into the43"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"living room, one into a utility space, and a massive dutch affair, round at the top, thatled to the sidewalk and street without. It was the bailey of the Fortress of UltimateDarkness, or so I would later call it.This house was where Susan and I made our home, after our lease was terminated,on the other side of El Camino Real. David had wanted to come visit for months, andit was after quite some time, and several unsuccessful attempts, that he finally walkedthrough the gate. He seemed to find it rather amusing, and joked about it, how nearlyimpossible it was for anyone to even approach our space without my explicit leave.Since he was practically living there that day we worked in the courtyard, it was abenefit he had come to appreciate. The house proper was a most curious affair, vaguelyMediterranean in style, built of stucco covered brick. Structurally, it was amazinglysolid. You could literally hurl your body at the walls and damage no more than yourselfin the attempt, and though it sat on a busy corner near downtown Mountain View,almost no noise of traffic was audible within. Back in October, on Friday the 13thnoless, we had gone into the 14thÆthyr, to petition one of the Governors of that spaceto find for us a suitable place in which to live and work. This house was the immediateand unmistakable result of that operation. I felt the entity did an outstanding job, butJones later noted the 14thwas one hell of a scary place to go just for that.Some time after Mercury and Sol, I banished Saturn and Jupiter, while Jones didthe rest. It was there in the courtyard that he first suggested we stop using the Thel-emic form of theStar Rubyin our work, saying the original, that which is printed inCrowley’sBook of Lies, was more appropriate under the circumstances. From that pointonward, the godname I used in the east when I banished the element of that quarterwasΧΑΟΣ, followed byΒΑΒΑΛΟΝin the north, and so on round my Temple.†Itis highly indicative of my state of mind that I found this a difficult change to com-prehend. I saw no reason to abandon Thelema entirely, yet neither did I have a clearimage in my mind of the full ramification of our actions to date.†TheStar Ruby, Crowley’s revision of the Golden Dawn’s Lesser Ritual of the Pentagram, waspublished in two distinct forms. The first, presented as Ch 25 ofThe Book of Lies(1913), gives thegodnames asΧα\tς[Chaos],Βαβαλον[Babalon],\u000fΕρως[Eros] andΨυχ\u0016[Psyche] counterclockwise,beginning in the east. These four were later changed toΘηρ\u0019ον[Therion], Nuit, Babalon, and Hadit,respectively, sometime between 1921 and the subsequent republication of theStar RubyinMagick InTheory and Practice(1929–30). Such promotion of Thelemic dogma is typical of Crowley’s work afterhe became Outer Head of theotoin 1922, when he transformed that order into an explicit vehicle forhisBook of the Law. The emergence of the 156 current is, in many ways, a return to the origins ofmagical traditions. This rejection of the ThelemicStar Rubyin favor of the original version, with itschaosandbabalongodnames, is but one example.44"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"The next day, 10 May, Keith, April, and her boyfriend from Seattle arrived at ourplace, and we all proceeded to Orbit One, and from there left for a public space, laterthat evening, not far from the apartment on Seabright. There we opened the 22ndÆthyr for Dr Abraham and his class, so he could realize his desire to see the blessedangels. Many oldcesassociates came down and participated in the ceremony. JohnGolding was there, and even Caitlin made a brief appearance at Orbit One. She satdown beside me on the sofa, and on the verge of tears passed me a note. It expressedher desire for David to return, for us all to return. This rift between us was tearing herapart. I should have been moved, and have regretted this for a long while now, but socaught up in what was happening, I just wasn’t. The pain in those sad, blue eyes hauntsme to this day.There was more amiss than that, too. April’s boyfriend was breaking my heart. Ihad fallen for her, rejoicing and blossoming in her company, and though I had madeno overt move towards her at all, believing myself still very much in a monogamousrelationship with Susan, I was in love, or at least thought I was. Her beau had returnedto her life, even if temporarily, and though she still desired to learn all that I knew aboutmagick, her attention was understandably focused on another. I was very jealous, butunder the circumstances, could no more express how I felt than I could express mydesire for her. Serpents were loose in my garden, despite our continuing success, and Iwas not at all pleased.Dr Abraham thanked us late that night, after we had closed the space in due order,and said he had seen what he came to see. Our performance had been textbook, aswe had planned, and it had gone on slowly building for hours. Susan said later thatwhen we at last calledparaoan, he appeared in the crystal, only to impress upon herthis was not the proper place to reveal himself, and that was the end of it. Lookingaround at the surprisingly large number of people in the room, it was ironic that of allthose outsiders, Abraham was one of the very few who remained awake. The rest wereasleep, and had been for quite some time.Following our second successful opening of the 22ndin Santa Cruz, we returnedonce more to our routine. April’s boyfriend soon departed the love nest for Seattle,by way of my house once again, and we re-melted a false start on ourSigillumto be.19 May found us opening the 1stÆthyr in our auxiliary Temple, as Susan preparedto carve our second beeswax disk. The next day, I went to the Lodge for the Sundayservice, and as one of the “ritualists”—that of “Fire”—took part in a performance of45"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"CF Russell’s “Group Ritual”, organized by Keith Schürholz. The rite was loosely basedon the Gnostic Mass, and so far as we knew, hadn’t been performed in many years,perhaps since Russell’s order, theGreat Brotherhood of God, finally closed its doors in1938. On Monday, I returned to the Lodge yet again, but this time with David, andby a most circuitous route. “Sneaking in the back way”, he called it. We didn’t attemptto knock on the door that morning. Kuhar Dušan was sleeping in the front room ofthe Lodge, what had once been Horus Temple, so we knocked on his window instead.Officially, David wasn’t supposed to be in the Lodge, nor was he allowed to removeany of his things, and that was but one of the issues we had come to address. Dušanraised the window, offering a cheerful but sleepy, “Halloh”.“Dušan, can we come in?” Jones asked, as if it were the most natural thing in theworld.“Ya, ya. Come in, come in.” We talked a while of this and that, and of our reasonsfor coming, before he accepted our offer of breakfast, dressed and left with us, out thesame window through which we had entered. There was another plot afoot, and it wasthis new twist in an already complex affair that had brought us to Oakland, and led usto seek the counsel of our elders.Late that night, after driving the forty or so miles back to the Fortress, we slippedquietly into the 9thÆthyr. David, Anne, Susan and myself opened a gate in the living-room, and stepped back into a space we had opened not six weeks before. As dawnovertook us, in a secret location in the Santa Cruz mountains, we read the Call of the9thyet again. In Scott’s Valley, over breakfast at Denny’s, we were in high spirits. Wehad demonstrated to our satisfaction an ability to pass into this space at will, and werenow in the process of creating a bridge, from the Fortress on the edge of the outermostAbyss, across the mountains and into Santa Cruz. It was insane I’ll admit, but it wasalso a carefully calculated maneuver, intended to throw up the biggest, gnarliest barrierwe could between our work and those we’d left behind in Oakland.On that morning of 22 May 1990, we were, in fact, on our way to a rendezvouswith theotherhalf of the rumor. Sometime after we arrived at Orbit One, David askedme directly if I was willing to participate in this little heresy. I said yes, without asecond thought. Jones had been made a Bishop in theegc, at a time when he wasstill at least nominally within the good graces of the Order. It was now his intentionto use that office to raise others to the episcopacy, though the rules had been changedby Bill Breeze in order to deter just this sort of “abuse”. Breaking with custom that46"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"stretched back as far as the tradition itself, the ceremony now required two Bishopsto participate in order to be valid. Fortunately for us, this was not an obstacle. Dušanhad just walked into the apartment on Seabright, and the long awaited moment hadarrived. Jones looked around the room gravely, with his hands outstretched palm topalm before him, and addressed those assembled in a sincere tone, “You should allknow you are probably in violation of your oaths just by being here”.“Aw, fuck Bill,” replied Dušan through his sweater, as he pulled it over his head andstood grinning defiantly at the group.Before continuing, Jones asked Susan. She declined. This didn’t surprise me, nor didit appear to surprise David. Though more than happy to be part of our little conspiracy,even encouraging and applauding our actions, she was still unhappy over her surpriseordination the previous year, and wanted no further involvement in ecclesiastic affairs,or even the Caliphate for that matter. David substituted his young lover in her placewithout skipping a beat, and with a room full of witnesses, some of them Brothers,she and I were madeliving Saintsin the Gnostic Catholic Church. Late that night, weread the Call of the 9thÆthyr a third and final time. My journal reports, after that, itall “rather fell apart”.The next day, I began structurally reinforcing the Abysmal end of our bridge back inMountain View, using a combination of Enochian planetary and elemental techniques.It was heavy work, this first session taking nearly an hour and a half to complete, butwe were convinced it needed to be done. I went on digging psychic trenches and throw-ing up astral ramparts in a similar fashion offand on for days, refining and redirectingmy approach as I went, still tenaciously working with five of the seven planets of theancients and their archangels as before. We had begun experiencing massive interfer-ence, in all sorts of peculiar ways. Some of the pressure was undoubtedly of externalorigin, though certainly not all by any stretch of the imagination. The bridge held, butit was razor thin. We could sally forth across it at will, and often did, retreating afterwhere none could follow. Unfortunately, running back and forth along that glisteningedge was ripping us to shreds.47"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"VIIMaster—We have been saying a good deal about a Lodge.

As the reader has doubt-less realized by now, a lot had happened before and after that date, much more thanstating the bare facts of it might suggest. By this time, David was only interested incollecting his things, which, so far, he had been prevented from doing. There was theissue of the money he allegedly had taken, and what was worse, he was now insist-ing loudly and as often as possible that the vast bulk of the library,the library at theLodge, was his. To be rid of him was one thing, and many there were who would behappy to see him go, but for him to take his contribution with him—or his personaleffects, depending on how one looks at it—was just too much to ask. They all believedDavid was coming unwrapped, and indeed he was, at least sometimes, anyway. Theywanted his books and papers, but they didn’t necessarily want him. I was left holdinghim together best I could, and with Susan’s support. He was a Brother in need, as faras I was concerned, but coping with the stress from sleepless nights of coffee, sugar,cigarettes, and magick, and days and days of anger and setbacks wasn’t easy. I had myown problems, and was already stretched to the limit myself.Susan was left alone to hold down the fort all too often, and it showed. True, weweren’t fighting as much, but that was because we were spending so little time alonetogether. The difficulties we had with ourselves and each other hadn’t gone away. Atbest, they were packed neatly and waiting for me on the doorstep when I came home.Naturally, the fighting returned whenever I did, and privacy allowed. She and I were48"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"coming apart too,bifurcatingin our own way. We had met a student in Prof Abraham’sclass, an eighteen year old, very eager to learn all he could about this magick business.The boy was slight of build with dark hair hanging to his shoulders, eyes a bittoo small set over a nose too big, perpetually dressed in basic black. He was an oddcreature, curiously hermaphroditic, but allowed to function as male through hormonalinjections. He was thrilled to be in our presence—especially Susan’s—and at the veryleast, he was entertaining. In our circumstances, we needed entertainment. Apparently,he hadn’t had a mother for quite some time, and what with Susan feeling neglected,they got along all too well. Jones called him Belial, suggesting he was the result of aGoëtic working carried out by John Golding and Keith Schürholz. We brought himhome with us like a stray puppy, after his Minerval, at what would soon be the newlocation of Orbit One. Obvious mistake in retrospect, but seemed the thing to do atthe time. We would eventually make him a Bishop, along with Clay Holden, as SaintsFriedrich Nietzsche and Giordano Bruno, respectively.Participating in the heresy was delightful, and this particular incident was no ex-ception. I have no regrets, even if it did all come to a bad end. Belial was at least aMinerval, though that still seemed bending the rules a bit. At least one of the “Wan-dering Bishops” we created was not associated with the Order in any way at all. Anyonecapable of reciting some form ofcredo,Thelemic or not, was eligible in our book, andthat alone should have provoked a response from the powers that be. If someone wasn’talready deeply displeased about our activities, it was just a matter of time. Long afterfollowing him across the Rubicon, I asked David why making Bishops was so hereticalin the eyes of our superiors. It was a secret.There are secrets and there are secrets, you see. Many knowThe Secret, both insideand outside the Order. Heidrick once said, “They’re allix◦s when you talk to them”,and it’s true, in more ways than one. It seems one of theotherkind of secrets, the kindnoneof us were supposed to know, not even with a wink and a nod, was a piece of paperfrom Crowley stating that a Bishop in theegcis equivalentto avii◦oto. Conferringthe one conferred the other. The informed reader will note that this sheds considerablelight on Breeze’s latest and otherwise cryptic requirement that only avii◦is eligible forthe office of Bishop. Jones knew this secret, and it was apparently what motivated hissudden interest in the episcopacy. Now I knew it too, and those above us, if they werepaying any attention at all, knew we had more than enough metaphysical technology tofound almost anything remotely Rosicrucian we had a mind to. Some people wanted to49"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"believe in some baroque conspiracy involving aBlack Lodgein Santa Cruz. Obviously,it was a question of numbers, but now it was possible for us to rectify that by thepower of the laying on of hands, just as our “founding fathers” had done when theyreconstituted theotoin the form of the Caliphate. From a magical standpoint, therewas no escaping Jones’s proposition: it elegantly called the bluffof his superiors, underthe guise of threatened insurrection.Small wonder then that I and those around me in Mountain View rapidly devel-oped a siege mentality. For weeks, I had felt in direct communication with the angels,and now found myself barricaded on the edge of the outermost Abyss, awaiting thenext wave of demons to scale the battlements. We spent less time in Santa Cruz thanbefore, and hoped by confining our operations somewhat to the Bay Area, we coulddraw attention to ourselves and away from Orbit One. It was a relatively thankless job.Few down there knew of our activities elsewhere, or the reasons behind them, and wegenerally left it at that. Any mention of politics in Clay’s presence invariably promptedyet another lecture on the virtue of avoiding such entanglements and his ongoing suc-cess in doing so. The first two or three performances were at least entertaining fortheir unintended irony, but after that, his harangue became just another tired rehearsalof old material, easily, if not politely, ignored.David was still prevented from retrieving his things from the Lodge, and grew in-creasingly furious as he struggled with those who now held sway there. His obsessionwas coming to occupy most all of his time and energy, and much of mine as well. JohnGolding’s place was an advanced outpost of sorts, where Jones could lurk secretly inOakland, within spitting distance of his opponents, and catch up on the latest news oftheir activities. The house was a small, nondescript bungalow, next door to the Lodge,and was the full time residence of Golding and one or two other males. It was knownas “Oz House”, but after David’s first use of the term, I knew it forever after astheSwamp. Keith and Golding had set up a work space there, complete with the pillarsthat had formerly stood in Horus Temple, using it principally for Goëtic work. Theywere opening their operations with “the Tuat”—often pronounced quite intentionallyastwat—before beginning their conjurations proper. The ritual is a modern adapta-tion of an Egyptian idea, essentially creating an astral environment modeled on thepapyrus swamps of the Nile delta, a soggy, pestilential place, infested with snakes andcrocodiles, and all manner of lethal things. It was the perfect sort of space for gainingthe upper hand on one’s demons, rather like “the Hall of the Neophytes”.50"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"On 10 June, I opened the 8thÆthyr, following a discussion with Jones about pur-suing my will in a more focused manner and with fewer distractions. Under the stressand strain of the circumstances, Susan and I were fighting even more than usual, andshe was absolutely livid when she learned I had opened an æthyr without consultingher first. Given the nature of the ceremony, of which she did not know the partic-ulars, I was not at all surprised. By Tuesday, 12 June, David and I were completelyexhausted, and as I drove Susan to work that afternoon, it seemed like days since I’dslept. Upon my return, I stretched out on the living room floor, joining David who wasalready asleep on the sofa. I closed my eyes in the warm glow of the afternoon sun,as it filtered softly through the window shades, and when I opened them again, I wassurprised to find myself now in an eery twilight. To the best of my knowledge, no morethan a moment had passed since I first laid down to rest, but staring at my watch inconfusion, it had in fact been in excess of four hours. I peered about in the gloom, andspied David staring back at me, in a most peculiar fashion. “Hello”, he said, and beganto make polite but trivial conversation, as one would to a total stranger, all the whilelistening intently to any answer I made, and smiling pleasantly, if a bit self-consciously,as he waited for me to fill the awkward silence that followed our brief exchanges. Itwas only as a note of confidence returned to his voice, and he began to relate his recentexperience, that I came to realize something was amiss.David had awoke in the near total darkness of the living room, with no idea whereor even who he was. The cats were running rampant through the house, growlingand leaping from the furniture as they charged from room to room. I lay flat on myback in the middle of the floor, in an animated and restless sleep, as if strugglingwith some unseen foe. Such a rude awakening would be enough to frighten anyone,but more alarming still were the visions of the apparent source of the disturbance. Tothe north, through the outside wall, he could see a creature, indistinct but loomingimpossibly large as it attempted to force its way through some unseen barrier. Thoughthe entity itself was invisible, whatever it was that checked its advance flashed andcrackled around it in pyrotechnic display, revealing the thing’s outline as it struggledto enter the house. In the midst of all this insanity, the monster fromThe ForbiddenPlanet, the animals yowling, and Jones’s total amnesia, I sat bolt upright like somethingout of a bad horror movie, and looked at my watch.One would expect safe and sane occultists to show some concern, but not us. Laterthat evening, at Harry’s Hofbräu in Mountain View, over pastrami,rotkohl,and beer,51"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"we casually and cheerfully discussed the days events with Susan, pleased and satisfiedthe defenses I erected were holding, even under an intense and concentrated attack.Our technology appeared to be most effective against the opposition we had faced sofar, and there was every reason to be pleased. The next day, we met with Mordecai inOakland, now acting Master of Thelema Lodge. It was an official meeting, in whichDavid and I were told he was now free to remove his belongings, including that portionof the library that was rightfully his. We were not, however, to be allowed to do allthis directly, but through a trusted third party instead, none other than John Golding.Obviously, we thought, Shapiro had lost his mind. All of David’s things, from hischess board and books to the box containing his copy of the court transcript in whichGrady’s ex-wife revealed the secret of theix◦—under oath, no less—was boxed up andtaken next door to the Swamp. What I thought was the biggest hurdle had now beencleared, and David was finally and at long last on his way to Santa Cruz.Curiously, Keith and Golding, though bound by oath to follow the King’s will, hadthroughout seemed more than happy to aid Jones as much as they could in extractinghis possessions from the Lodge, and providing intelligence concerning the politicalsituation and machinations of his opponents. But once his archive was in their hands,and Jones was as a consequence spending time in Oakland once more, Susan, Belialand I began to notice a certain resistance to proceeding as planned. It was more inertiathan outright opposition, but the change was unmistakable, and he appeared suddenlyreluctant to move his things to Mountain View and on to Santa Cruz, along withhimself. It is possible that so close to his former home, David began to have secondthoughts, but at the time, we strongly suspected it was the result of external influence.I would not then, nor indeed would I now suspect Keith of opposing either David ormyself in anything. He was a dear friend, and trite as it might seem, I truly loved himas a brother. Keith and I were peers, equals in my eyes, and so far as I know the feelingwas mutual, even after he was designated my tutor in the A...A... He was open andhonest, as quick to smile as to offer aid or friendly advice. I would not have suspectedhim of duplicity at all. Golding, however, was another story.What precisely the attraction was between those two I haven’t a clue. In a discussionof just this subject, Keith once said he had seen Golding’s Holy Guardian Angel, thatit was indescribably beautiful, despite outward appearances. Even with this additionalinformation, and from a respected source no less, I remained unconvinced. There wassomething about him I never cared for, even before we did the 19thtogether in Orinda,52"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"though beyond the fact he was dull as dishwater I am at a loss to say just what thatsomething was. Golding was a conjurer in the traditional sense, complete with funnyoutfit and paper crown, stewed in Hebrew Qabalah, and trapped in the Hermetic,Golden Dawn paradigm like a fly in amber. So hidebound did he appear in my eyes thatI found it impossible to imagine anything new and earth shattering, or even nominallyinteresting, resulting from his work. When we moved Jones’s possessions out of theLodge, and Golding was charged with insuring that nothing was removed that did notactually belong to him, I made some off-hand comment about how soon the lot wouldhave to be packed up yet again and relocated to Santa Cruz. “Well, we’ll see aboutthat”, was his only response, said while staring vacantly at some point over my rightshoulder. I didn’t like the sound of it, or the distant look in his eye when he said it, andeven at the time, it left me in considerable doubt just what his intentions might be.Susan, on the other hand, had no doubts at all. She was convinced that once it finallydawned upon him that Jones was serious, and fully intended to relocate the library toOrbit One, Golding was actively engaged in impeding our progress. Perhaps he wantedDavid’s archive for himself, or it may have been he was merely following orders fromabove, since she also believed His Holiness Bill Breeze had begun to take an active andhostile interest in our activities as well. It may even have been Caitlin who pressuredhim into getting involved, but whatever the reason, Susan was convinced Golding wasinterfering directly in our affairs. For myself, I tried best I could to keep the entireconflict on an impersonal basis as much as possible. Fighting some nameless, facelessopposition was one thing, but specifically wishing harm on a Brother was not on myagenda, whatever my feelings for him personally might be. I only wanted to proceedas planned, to complete our move to Santa Cruz, and get on with the new life we hadcreated for ourselves. What the Order and those within it did or did not want was nolonger my concern.Whether the assumptions about Golding were true or not is neither here nor there,as the record shows regardless of the reason, in the weeks following the recovery ofJones’s books and papers, he now spent much of his time in the Swamp, seldom ven-turing to Orbit One at all. My belief in him and in his cause was already strained,and though I still trusted him personally, I no longer felt that he could be relied uponto always do the right thing, or even to do what he had previously claimed to be hiswill. After all, it had not been that long since David and I were at my house, and thephone rang. I answered, and an unpleasantly cheerful voice said, “This is Bill Breeze.53"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"Let me speak to David Jones.” I excused myself, and signaled who was holding on theline, quite pleased that the moment of truth had finally arrived. Much to my surprise,David dropped his head in resignation, and reached for the receiver without meetingmy eye. Instead of sounding a note of defiance commensurate with his actions to date,or arguing, or even stalling for time, all I heard was, “Yes, sir...Yes,sir...No,sir...Iunderstand, sir.” In my eyes, up until that moment, Jones had been more than human,the archetypical revolutionary with a heart of the purest flame and ice water cascad-ing through his veins. The “yes man” I sat and watched that day on the phone lookedmore like some rag-assed renegade who, when finally cornered, no longer possessedthe strength, or the will, to fight.An oath is one of the most powerful, most inviolable of all magical acts. It is theexplicit expression of one’s will, and once made in earnest may never be truly undone,even should one try. David had taken many oaths in the Caliphate by that time, eachmore explicitly binding his will to that of his so-called superiors than the last, swearingeternal fealty to a hierarchy that dead ended, at least outwardly, in the unlikely personof Bill Breeze. So far in our little endeavor, he had successfully avoided those who heldthe end of his chain, and so long as that lasted, he was free. Jones once said to me,long before these times of trial and tribulation, that we may reveal whatever we wish tothose below us, but must constantly guard ourselves in the presence of those of a higherdegree, and the more highly placed an individual, the less they were to be trusted. Heexplained that as a Minerval, or even ai◦, one enjoyed more genuine freedom thananyone else in the Order, and invited me to read the degree rituals, and demonstratethis for myself. If one believed in the Caliphate, this was a most mysterious paradox, atleast for those few who knew or suspected that such was the case, but obviously a moresober individual might have recognized a trap when they saw one, however temptingthe bait might be.In some sense, David should be praised for honoring vows made to individuals forwhom he felt little but contempt, perhaps even demonstrating thereby a deep andabiding faith in theideaof the Ordo Templi Orientis, if not necessarily in that palemanifestation we know as the Caliphate. But hearing David on the phone with Breezethat day made my stomach churn. Here was a man for whom I had long held thehighest respect, apparently groveling before an absurd caricature of authority who wasnot worthy to kiss the ground beneath his feet, or mine for that matter. Of all that I lostin those days, losing my hero was the most bitter loss of all. I learned a fundamental54"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"difference between Jones and myself that day. To him, the poorly scripted children’spageants with which he had been honored, and the oaths he had taken therein, weremore important than his word given to one of his fellows. The Caliphate was just athing, “which neither can see, nor hear, nor walk” [Revelation9:20]. It could not beheld to any vow, even were it capable of making any. The only bonds that truly matterin this world are those between an individual and their Holy Guardian Angel, andthose between one man or woman and another, between Brother and Brother, whenone invests their trust in their fellow in exchange for being trusted in return. This is thebasis of any culture, the interpersonal relationships that constitute the bedrock uponwhich it rests.55"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"VIIII cling unto the burning Æthyr like Lucifer that fell through the Abyss, and by the furyof his flight kindled the air.And I am Belial, for having seen the Rose upon thy breast, I have denied God.And I am Satan!

His condition worsened to the point that in myjournal, I actually began to note the occasions on which he appeared sane. On Tuesday,19 June, I invoked the archangelCumael,and in desperation petitioned that entitymost fervently that those who opposed us might be overthrown. Soon after, Jonesproposed that I undertake a more thorough banishing in order to undo any and allpotential attacks. To this end, at dawn on the following day, I opened with the invoc-ationIsrafel, banished the planets and the spheres, and erected the four Watchtowers,all the way down to the angels of theservient squares,using all eighteen Enochian Keys,summoning each and every good spirit represented in theGreat Tableto my aid. Whenat last I closed withSamech, nearly five hours had passed since I began, and I was leftunable to do much more than lie around the house for the rest of the day.On each of the next six days, I performed the same banishing in a similar fashion.At the conclusion of this seven-day cycle—one for each chapter ofLiber ARARITA,incorporated into the ritual—opposition to our designs continued to mount. Obvi-ously, the eleven spheres were not enough, and it was therefore decided to banish thetwenty-two paths of theTree of Lifeas well, the magickal equivalent of a “scorchedearth” campaign, hopefully one which would leave no known basis for a sustainedeffort against us. At first, this was done gradually, distributed over a three-day period.Then on 1 July, I banished the planets and erected Watchtowers down to the twenty-four Seniors, before banishing all the spheres and all the paths in turn, concludingwithSamechas before.

Come what may, Iwas resolved to do what must be done, and should the house have caught fire midwaythrough, I would no doubt have completed my daily ritual, though my Temple fell infire brands and ashes around me.After midnight on the sixth day of this latest cycle, immediately following my ritual,David returned to the house after several day’s absence. He came bearing a message,one over which we would argue for the rest of the night. He said it was imperative Icease my operation at once. Just because it was my will to win through our present dif-ficulties was not going to prevent our Brethren from continuing their attacks so long asthey were able. They may have claimed to be Thelemites, but in their broad interpret-ation, this easily included interfering with the will of another. Do what thou please,not do what thou wilt. Nothing ever done on my part was directed at any specificindividual or individuals, as all was leveled squarely and consistently at whatever stoodin my way. My method was a simple intelligence test, as far as I was concerned: if theyassumed I would alter my course to accommodate their wants, then, from a Thelemicstandpoint, I was not responsible for the consequences of their actions. David, how-ever, insisted that regardless of who was behind the attacks, or why they continued, theLodge would be destroyed, and this alone was sufficient reason to stop.Looking back on that night, I am always struck by the irony of that moment.Here was the infamous Demon Jones, whom our Brothers in Oakland had vilifiedand fought, now contesting with me for their continued existence, though they wouldnever have believed it. Make no mistake, I loved them individually every bit as much ashe did, but to me, their choice was clear: either back off,orsuffer accordingly. He andI both agreed that Thelema Lodge was no longer capable of serving any useful magicalpurpose, at least so far as our interests were concerned, nor did it appear likely thatit would ever do so again in the future. Moreover, it was now abundantly clear theywould not allow the three of us to go peacefully to Santa Cruz together. All our oraclesagreed with us on this point. It was David’s position, however, that those who opposedus were so stupid, so pig-headed, they simply couldn’t help themselves. Fighting wastheir first and only choice. Consequently, if I continued on my present course, peoplewere going to get hurt, in all likelihood himself among them, and some might even57"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"be killed. In the end, there was no arguing with his logic. He was right, and we bothknew it. Reluctantly, perhaps even foolishly, I relented.On 4 July, I disintegrated in fits of rage and despair. There was no turning back atthat point, not without the direst of consequences, and this idea burned in my mindso intently I was incapable of anything resembling coherent thought or acceptablebehavior. When I opened the 8thÆthyr alone some weeks before, I had taken a bloodoath that I would know and do my will. No “an it harm none” clause had been included,explicit or implied, yet here I was, betrayed by my own nobility. I knew in my heart ofhearts that stepping aside for the sake of another in this instance might easily result inthe loss of all my hopes for the future. It was my will to relocate to Santa Cruz, andDavid had stated this was his will as well. It had never been my intent to fight withour Brothers in the Order—though my good intentions never stopped anyone, myselfincluded. Jones and I had agreed to take this just as far as it would go, and now he hadconvinced me to step offbefore the ride had come to a complete stop. In the midst ofthat day’s madness, I learned from Susan that if I wasn’t out of the house within threeweeks, she would be leaving herself.No one could have blamed her for wanting relief from all I had put her through,at least no one other than myself. I felt she was stabbing me in the back, and thisdespite the fact I was convinced thePZ gas, a paranoia inducing technology Davidclaimed to be in the possession of our enemies, had finally got through, and Susanwasn’t entirely responsible for her actions. It never occurred to me at the time—at leastnot seriously—that if she were affected by something lobbed at us by our opponents,then in all probability so was I. For the record, my assessment of what took placebetween Susan and myself has changed with the passing years. For losing her, I canhold no one responsible but myself. On top of all my personal issues, it was I whosought to know and realize my will, even to some limited extent succeeding. Pursuingthat will was not possible within our relationship as it then existed, and rather thanchange my partnership with Susan in fundamental ways, I personally elected to destroyit altogether. It wasself-immolation, just as Jones would later describe it, an act morefitting for some half-witted Christian than a self-proclaimed Thelemite.When David saw what was happening, he showed grave concern, and suggested Inow attempt to put it all back ceremonially, but in a form that our opposition wouldnot find at all to their liking. The Spheres and paths were replaced, but this time usingFr Achad’s eccentric attributions. In my frantic state, I was quick to try anything that58"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"might help, however little I cared for the system personally. The only ceremonialistsI knew who used it were Keith and Golding, and to my mind, that didn’t speak wellof either. All this was implemented using a newly reformed system of godnames, with“chaos” for the second Sphere, “babalon” for the third, and so on, similar to thatwhich I had used from the beginning, but now purged completely of any lingeringGolden Dawnisms. This new tactic did have some appreciable effect, as within fourdays, Susan had changed her mind: she now insisted I leave immediately, whether Iwanted to go or not, and informed me that Belial would be moving in to take my place.After all these years, it is still hard to believe it had been just thirteen weeks, exactlyninety-one days, since I began banishing the planets on 9 April.I argued and pleaded, but she was resolute and would not be moved. I wanderedhomeless with Jones for a time, roaming over the floor of the Abyss, laying my headwherever anyone would still let us in. This world in which I now found myself wasjust as surreal as that of the 9thÆthyr, but harsh and jagged, where the sublimelybeautiful and the deplorably hideous clashed and strove with one another. There wasno formal ceremony at all now, not even the planetary work that had counted the daysand hours of my existence and provided a framework for my nomadic life, nor wasthere much written in my journal about our activities. We were still using magick, butit was far less structured, even in time. More than ever before, we were more likelyto be found plotting our course while sipping cappuccino in some outré café in SanFrancisco, waiting for Mercury hour to arrive in order to take our next bearing. Itwas Enochian sorcery on the fly, arriving at all decisions through consultation of ourconstant companion, the Wilhelm/Baynes edition of theI Ching. Mr Yi had been afaithful guide and counsel from the beginning of our endeavor, but now our oraclesspoke only the worst: dissolution, decline, and departure of the great and the good.On 17 July, David did the 25thÆthyr in my Temple. Other than Susan and myself,no one had ever done any ritual there before. In retrospect, I suppose it had to be done,as even in my absence the Fortress still constituted a navigational hazard, but the effectof what he did that day was like packing it full of astral explosives and striking a light.Before he began, Jones informed me the lid of the Pastos†had been jammed shut,†The Pastos is the coffin that lies beneath the altar in the “Vault of the Adepts”, as portrayed in theAdeptus Minorceremony of the RR et AC. Among other things, Mr Jones’s statement implies no onewas able to pass the Sixth Sphere [“Beauty”, Sol, and so on], at least locally. The symbolism itself isfrom theFama Fraternitatis, in which the uncorrupted body of Christian Rosencreutz was discoveredin a similar tomb, along with theBook T.59"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"and I was the one who had done it. He complained that “they couldn’t get it open”,whomever “they” might have been. David appeared satisfied with the results whenhe’d finished, so I assume he must have been successful. I, on the other hand, was leftshattered by the experience, my psyche shredded into little pieces, drifting in the voidinane. I could see it coming, knew precisely what he was doing and what would be theeffect, but was powerless to stop him, or even offer so much as a feeble protest. Lauraand Anne were there, and in fact had been in the Temple from the beginning, myselfbeing admitted only after all was in place and the ceremony opened. They were allquite kind to me afterwards, more so at least than I expected, and when it was over, wepacked up the last of Jones’s archive, and drove the forty miles across the Santa Cruzmountains to Orbit One together, for what would be the last time.To a dispassionate eye, my will had been fulfilled, though it had never occurredto me Susan might not be coming along. One might even observe that the originalplan was for me to go to Santa Cruzalone, with my wife to follow soon after withthe remainder of our household. I did move David and his library to Orbit One asplanned, and stayed there myself as well for a time, while I wandered about with LauraChandler in search of a place to live. Though the why of it escapes me now, it wasproposed that she and I share living quarters, along with her two small children. Lauraneeded a break from her work as an exotic dancer at The Century in San Francisco,and thought the change of pace and scenery might do her good. She said she couldcook, and promised to be a good sister, kissing me on the cheek when she said it, athing I found both comforting and deeply depressing at the time. In my fragmentedstate of mind, the idea of symbolic incest, and the opportunities the situation mighteasily present, were lost on me, however blindingly obvious they are today. Laura toldme this as we stood alone in what was left of my home, recently abandoned by my wifeand her beau. The two lovers had dropped the 3rdÆthyr before quitting the house,leaving a burst water pipe gushing in the crawlspace below. How it was broken, andwhy they either did not notice, or simply elected to leave anyway, was a mystery, andstill is.For better or worse, there are a lot of mysteries in this tale, despite my best efforts topiece the fragments together into a coherent whole. For instance, I still wonder myselfsometimes if Susan took other lovers, prior to Belial. Only she and some hypotheticalother could know the answer to that, and it matters less now than it ever did. She hada peculiar habit of telling the truth, and admitted only to sleeping with him. Naturally,60"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"I believed her. In the same breath, I was accused of cheating on her with April, longbefore her young lover arrived on the scene, and she went on to claim that David and Ihad conspired at some point to trade her sexual favors to Oberon, in exchange for hisparticipation in our designs. Jones is possibly responsible for this last, and for a longtime, I blamed him for falsely reporting I was sleeping with April as well. Many yearslater, it finally occurred to me that Clay was a much more likely culprit, having bothher ear, and much to gain by making such an outrageous claim, whether he believed ithimself or not. In point of fact, April Dawn and I did not consummate our lust untilthe “Feast of the First Night of the Beast and his Bride”, on 12 August. I adored her,in many ways as much or more so than Susan, but it was with bittersweet resignationthat I lay down beside her. The loss of my wife was by far the biggest emotional issuethen in my life, and surrendering to my desire for another meant my relationship withSusan was officially at an end.When it became obvious to all around us that April and I were getting together atlast, Clay interfered in all sorts of petty ways, even going so far as to pull her aside,and lecture her on the virtues of safe sex, saying obviously Susan had been sleepingwith David for some time, and therefore I was in all likelihoodhivpositive, withouteven knowing. Two malicious lies in one go—well, at least one, anyway—and it wasprecisely the kind of slander I should have expected from him under the circumstances,but was still too naive to acknowledge it, even to myself.Holden went on to mewl and whine after the fact, claiming the raw lust intermit-tently filling the air was a distraction from his work, the very work David and I hadjust recently enabled him to do. I appealed to Jones, and he stated that someone’s “Ozrights” were clearly being violated. Strung out as I was at the time, I completely mis-interpreted what he said, automatically assuming he was upholding Holden’s cause atthe expense of my own. I was generally convinced, after he took me into the 25th, thathe had turned on me, with a vengeance. I fully expected him to favor Clay becauseof his role as the custodian of theces, in much the same way as I believed he hadsacrificed my life and wellbeing for the sake of his A...A..., so they could open thePastos and advance their candidates as desired. After a defiant and showy display ofpacking my few belongings, I returned to Mountain View and took April with me.We arrived to find Susan had now permanently abandoned both the house and mycat, after promising to look after them while I established myself elsewhere and couldmake other arrangements.61"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"IXDuring my final months in California, I lived in the ruins of the Fortress of UltimateDarkness with Loki, my Balinese cat. More like camping really, though it was all thehome I had. April didn’t stay with me long, soon leaving for Seattle, where she helpedput her boyfriend’s affairs in order, and returned with him to Orbit One. I was stillmore than welcome in their midst, but for better or worse, it was stability I desired mostin my life, and did not adapt well to an open relationship, however pleasant. April’sbeau had impeccable taste, and not just in women—though we obviously shared thatone as well—and with much in common, I enjoyed what little time we spent together.Although I still journeyed to Orbit One now and again, most of my time was spentcloser to home.Of all our acquaintances and so-called friends, only one was particularly unhappythat my wife and I had become estranged, a man known to us simply as Gizmo. Healone made any attempt to resolve the differences between us, or betrayed any sym-pathy, or depth of feeling, when discussing my plight. When he learned I was livingalone, Gizmo even came down to look after me, bringing his girlfriend Bonnie withhim. He was an artist, as was she, and his work was simply astonishing, a direct ex-pression of his magical and spiritual practice.I seldom did formal ritual with Gizmo, yet whenever we shared the same roof itwas always one continuous magical act. He wasout there, way out there, farther thanmyself, even farther than Susan, if such a thing might be imagined. On the first oc-casion he came to stay, light bulbs blew throughout the house, two on the first day,and four more soon to follow. As I climbed up to change yet another, he said, “Yeah, Iforgot to tell you about this thing with me and technology. Sorry about that.” Late oneevening, he needed to return home on some errand or another, and had packed theirthings and waited impatiently for the arrival of the next north-bound train. Bonniewas listening to the stereo, at full blast, dancing in the living room as usual, obliviousto his repeated requests that she accompany him to the platform at once. There was asoftpop, the music stopped and the house went dark. “Okay”, she said, “That wasn’treallynecessary”. I followed them out the door, and as they hurried down the street,I noted that my house was the only one in the area without power. Returning inside,62"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"I located a flashlight, but as I went to check the fuse box, the train whistle soundedin the distance, and the lights mysteriously returned. Such events were common in hispresence, and what we accomplished during our time together I was not exactly sure,nor am I at liberty to go into details now, but as a result of an introduction he gave meto the Lord of the Labyrinth, I was granted an exit from the game, and went home.It seems obvious now that as a direct consequence of his assistance, I am here to relatemy story today.At the winter solstice, my father came from back east to retrieve what was left ofhis son. We packed my books, papers, and accumulated detritus into his truck, andwith my car stuffed to overflowing on a trailer behind us, we drove across the UnitedStates in under three nights time. The temperatures dropped below freezing the nightwe left, something that hadn’t happened in recent memory, and pipes froze and burstall over the Bay Area. Not at all surprising really, as I had always said it would be a coldday in Hell when I returned home. It was not a joyous return, by any means, thoughall of us generally tried to make the best of it. My intention when I left California wasto end it all, and I was deliberately going somewhere I knew at least the cat would bewell cared for once I was gone. Obviously it didn’t end that way, but it was a very longtime before I stopped regretting not following through. There was some contact at firstwith the folks out west, despite the distance and the cloud under which I’d left. Apriland I even spent a week in a motel, about a hundred miles from my parent’s farm, inlate October of 1991. My mother was furious at the very idea, but my father actuallyasked when I returned if I’d had a good time—when his wife wasn’t around, of course.Despite my mother’s lurid imagination, April and I spent most of our time sittingacross a table from one another, with a glass, a bottle of Old Bushmill’s, and a deck ofcards between us, playing gin. The game was deadly serious, and the company was asdelightful as ever. Before putting her on a plane back to California, I had the oppor-tunity to show her the family farm while my parents were away. After walking withme on those 333 acres of pasture and woodland, even on a cold and bleak Feast of AllSaints, she said she finally understood why I would go into exile so willingly. In her,I found as pleasant a companion as I have ever known, and as good a friend. AfterI had been routed, and Susan had requested I leave, it was April who bandaged mywounds and offered her hospitality and more without reservation. She staunched theblood and healed my soul just enough for me to make my escape. It is a pity my fatherand mother will never understand that she probably saved my life.63"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"In the time we spent working, fighting and drinking together, my father and Ieventually made peace, and developed a respect for each other that had always beenwanting in our relationship. For that, at least, I am truly grateful, and had things endeddifferently in California, it might never have happened. Roaming once more over thehills of my childhood restored me somewhat, and I quickly began to gather myselfabout me. Soon I was keeping a journal again, and took up Raja and Hatha Yogaonce more. I even keptReshbest I could among the great unwashed. After years of acosmopolitan existence, life in even a familiar rural setting was quite a challenge. Keithonce said he loved the San Francisco Bay Area, because it was one of the few places inthe United States where one could politely say, “I am an occultist”. In Appalachia, bycontrast, sometimes even Catholics are viewed with suspicion. The loneliness of livingjust past the trailing edge of civilization has been the worst of it. Were it not for Apriland one or two others, on the phone and in a constant stream of letters and literature,I don’t know how I could have carried on at all. I returned to school, and completedmy degree in Engineering, and even worked at it for a time, while our grand design inSanta Cruz faded. Jones eventually moved on with Anne, taking his library with himwhen he left. Hair-raising rumors of his activities reached me for sometime after that,but since I was no longer in a position to judge their validity first hand, I shall hereremain silent.David once said he had lots of enemies, on that particular occasion mentioning byname a man in San Francisco, someone he described as a Holmes to his Moriarty. Heseemed to find some personal satisfaction and no little humor in saying it, too. By thetime I left the Bay Area, I knew precisely how this poor soul must have felt, and thoughI was not actively stalking him with lethal intent, the thought had occasionally crossedmy mind. David had become the Devil incarnate to me, and believing any nightmarishtale told about him was a simple matter. Gizmo said Jones’s only reaction to newsof my imminent departure was, “Well, we’ve lostMichael”, and that was that. Trueenough, but after all we had been through together, to say nothing of my supportingand sheltering him when no one else gave him so much as the time of day, one mightexpect a little more heartfelt emotion than that. In the final analysis, despite any harshjudgments I might have reached after the fall, he gave me what I needed most, aprecious gift that many desire but few receive: a chance to start over, just as he’d oncesaid. David himself descended into his own private hell after I left, or so I was told,and was subsequently ejected from the Order. I must confess, on the offchance that64"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"some stray copy of this might fall into his hands, that I thought this freedom was whathe wanted most. In my anger and grief, born out of a childish need for vengeance,and hoping to force upon him a fate worse than death, I opened the 15thÆthyr, onan upper floor of the stacks at my university’s main library, and with my own blood,I petitioned the Governors of that Aire that he might be re-admitted. Since then,though I don’t know all the details, I understand he has indeed returned to the Order,but has otherwise reformed his life and is doing well. If I am somehow responsiblefor his falling back into Uncle Oto’s good graces, I can only offer him my sincerestapologies.As my dream disintegrated in California, there was little I could do but watch inhorror from such a distance, though cracks had begun to appear in Santa Cruz, evenbefore I left. By that time, Clay’s work had already come to include proving once andfor all the Dee material was just a sophisticated form of cryptography, used in service toHer Majesty Queen Elizabeth I. Perhaps this had been his hope from the beginning,for all I know. Wouldn’t us naughty magick types look foolish when he was right,and we were found to be solemnly chanting, “The Duke is secretly supporting thecause. Still suspects nothing. Your humble servant, as always. 007”. Holden seemedto take great pride in the monastic life of a pious scholar, keeping himself pure frompolitical embroilment and this business of hopping from bed to bed that marred thework of his peers. Despite this, however, he always presented himself as the humbleand manifestly unworthy recipient of divine grace, most notably in the form of rollsand rolls of microfilm held in theces’s collection, containing most, if not all, the extantsource material. I thought him just a lovelorn and deluded fool—he had just lost yetanother girlfriend, this time dumped for discussing agricultural reform with me, andenjoying the conversation a bit too much—but despite my misgivings, he went onto electronically publish the first three books of Dee’sMysteriorum Libri, under theauspices of “The John Dee Publication Project”.Susan called my parent’s house one day, many months after my return, and asked ofme a boon. She explained she was filing for a “no fault” divorce, and Holden had kindlyvolunteered to help by signing the petition as witness, under the proviso that I not hunthim down like a dog for doing so. At the time, I thought this an utterly bizarre request,and assumed that like so many around him, Clay had at last gone “balls-up crackers”,as he liked to put it. It never occurred to me that in his mind, I might have every reasonto desire his unfortunate demise, should I learn the full extent of his involvement. For65"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"that matter, Susan had gone round the bend as well, as far as I was concerned. The restof us seemed to drift back to earth in time, but if she did—bless her heart—she gaveno outward indication of it in the few times we communicated after I left. I understandwhen the dust settled, none of the other kids wanted to play with her anymore. I lovedher dearly, and in a way still do, but can’t honestly say that I blame them.Her loss of social standing mattered little, as Susan was eventually well cared for.David petitioned Belial,in my presence,no less, to “make this woman wealthy”, and forhis part the boy agreed to get right on it. According to theGoëtia:He is a Mighty and a Powerful King, and was created next after Lucifer...Hespeakethwith a Comely Voice, and declareth that he fell first from among the worthier sort, thatwere before Michael, and other Heavenly Angels...Notewellthat this King Belial musthave Offerings, Sacrifices and Gifts presented unto him by the Exorcist, or else he willnot give True Answers unto his Demands.What precisely was offered I shall here leave to the reader’s imagination, but she sub-sequently married very well indeed, and lives quite comfortably with her family, last Iheard.April and I kept in touch the longest, though with time, we too drifted apart. I liedto myself and others that I was going to return some day, and she appeared to believeme, at least at first. She had faith in me, though unfortunately more than I had myself.There came a time when I did finally resolve to return, but she had got on with livingher own life by then, and didn’t have time or the energy to help. Without support forthe move, or some reason to be there once I arrived, I dropped the idea and acceptedmy fate. We communicated a few times after that, followed by a long silence whichstretches unto the present day. With April went all sense of community, of a commonstock of shared experience, a thing so many of us take for granted when communicatingwith those around us. My past receded, becoming unreal and irreconcilable with mypresent surroundings and mode of existence, and in place of a longed-for day of releaseand redemption, a deep-seated disillusion settled over me, haunting the relative highsand lows of my mundane existence.For eleven years after I left the Bay Area, I did everything from rake hay and pullcalves to cranking computer code and supervising heavy construction. My life was quitesuccessful, when I put my mind to it, holding positions of relative responsibility andpower. None of it brought me any real satisfaction, or elevated my sense of self worthin the slightest.

It seemed certain that something had gone hideously wrong in my life, andover time, blaming myself for it all became just another habit. Like it or not, whetherI consciously believed it or not, I was still bound to the Caliphate, as surely as if anoose had been placed round my neck and they yet held tightly to the running end.Though I could still chat with Heidrick on the phone after I left, and he was just ascongenial as ever, there was no denying to myself my personal disgrace. In abusivedomestic situations, the victims are barred from close association with those on theoutside by the simple fact that the most important aspects of their life simply cannotbe told to anyone, not even their closest and dearest friends. The Caliphate is muchthe same, as even if a Brother walks away, there remains an invisible barrier betweenthat unfortunate soul and the uninitiated around them. For instance, Jones once said,speaking of suitable lovers, if one could not perform theStar Ruby,Star Sapphire, andSamech, in front of a given individual, they should not be seriously considered for along-term relationship. Imagine the prospects of satisfying those criteria in the heartof rural America.67"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"XThe fire of God is fallen from heaven, and hath burned up the sheep, and the servants,and consumed them; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.Job 1:16Theotoof my hopes and dreams is gone, if indeed it has ever existed.

Gurus of the new and improved Caliphatemaintain it is possible, even desirable, to remain normal in the eyes of modern societyand still be a top-drawer occultist. Truly, the mind boggles, and when I learned of thisnew Kingdom Age doctrine, one better suited to collecting dues than promoting self-realization, rest assured I gave thanks for my exile and freedom from occultists and theoccult, albeit with a heavy heart.But in the spring of 2001, I happened upon Joel Biroco, who himself had retiredfrom the occult scene some years ago. Early in what became a voluminous exchange ofemails, I was surprised to find strikingly similar themes in his work of the late 1980sand my own. I had never heard of the 156 current as such, which Joel had announced in1989, but it spoke to me, out of my own experience, not from any persuasive argumenton his part. I could feel its ring of truth in my bones, and my own story seemed anobvious example of the emergence ofkaos-babalon. With caution born of bitter dis-appointment, I offered to tell this lengthy tale of magick and intrigue. Joel suggested Iattempt to set it all down in some coherent manner, for my own sake more than anyoneelse’s, and this is the result of that attempt.Aside from finally coming to grips with the reality of what happened in Califor-nia, the most challenging part, and certainly the most rewarding, has been unpackingmy life and work, unearthing it from more than a decade of dust and idleness. Whilesorting through boxes and mounds of paper I’d long forgotten possessing, I began toremember, with unexpected clarity, what it was like to connect with a live magical cur-rent, and what it had meant to me in a time grown dim and shadowy with the passageof years. Occasionally, I would get a pretty good blast of the bullshit and paranoia stilllingering in my past, the unexploded ordinance from the war, but dazed and confusedI struggled on.

In focusing on whatothers may or may not have done, I lost sight of what I had done myself, what Ihave accomplished, as well as the mistakes I have made.

Of all my manifold errors, this wasthe greatest mistake of all. There never was such an earthly individual, nor will thereever be.
