[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"1GERARD CREMONENSISON ASTRONOMICAL GEOMANCY.ecause Astronomy is so transcendent and subtil an Art in itself, thattherein a man ought to have respect unto so many things before he canattaine to true judgment thereby, because the eye of the understanding willnot pierce unto the half thereof, and few Doctors of our later time havebeen found so experienced therein that they know sufficiently how tojudge thereby; Therefore I have composed this work, which I wilt have to be named,Astronomical Geomancy; wherein, I will sufficiently teach how to judge with less labour andstudy. For in this present science it is not requisite to behold neither the Ascendant, northe hour in a Table, as it is in Astrology.It is expedient therefore, to make four unequal lines, by the points casually set down;and to joyne together those points; and out of the points which are not joyned together,which do remain in the heads of the lines, (as it is done in Geomancie) extract one figure;and the signe of the Zodiack that answereth to that figure, put for the Ascendent, for thewords sake. If Acquisitio arise from the heads of those four Lines, let Aries be placed in theAscendent; if Laetitia, or the lesser Fortune put Taurus in the Ascendent; if Puer or Rubeus,place Gemini; If Albus, Cancer; if Via, Leo; if Conjunctio or the Dragons Head, Virgo; ifPuella, Libra; if Amissio or Tristitia, Scorpio; if the Dragons Tail, Sagittary; if Populus, Cap-ricorn; if Fortuna major, Aquary; if Carcer, then put Pisces for the Ascendent. Afterwards inthe second House, let that signe be placed which immediately succeeds the other. In thethird House the third Signe, and so place the rest in order until you come unto the end ofthe Signes; and make one square figure divided into twelve equal parts, and therein placethe Signes in order, as it is in Astrology, and as you may finde them in this figure: neitherare we here to regard the * witnesses, or * Judge, or any other thing, which belongs to Geo-mancie; but onely the sixteen Figures, that by them we may have the twelve Signes, towhich they agree; and observe the maner of the Figure as it is here placed. Afterwards it is requisite to make four Lines by course for every Planet, by points casu-ally pricked down; and likewise for the Dragons Head, as you have done for the Ascendent,and divide those points by twelve; and that which remaineth above twelve, or the twelfthitself, if a greater number doth not remain, retaine, and the Planet for which the projectionwas made, place in that House of which the superabounding number shall be; that is, ifthere remain twelve, let the Planet be placed in the twelfth House; if ten, in the tenthHouse; if one, in the first House; if two, in the second House; and so of the rest. And youought alwayes to begin from the Sun, and afterwards from the Moon, then from Venus andMercury, and from Saturn, Jupiter and Mars, and the Dragons Head and Dragons Tail; butB"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"2you must alwayes take heed that you do not make a question in a rainy, cloudy, or a verywindy season, or when thou art angry, or thy minde busied with many affairs; nor fortempters or deriders, neither that you may renew and reiterate the same Question againunder the same figure or forme; for that is error.Questions of the first House.If you are desirous to know concerning the life of any man whether it shall be long orshort, behold the Lord of the Ascendent, who if he be in strong Angles, it signifies longlife; in succedents, a middle age; and in cadent Houses, a short life; and if he be in strongAngles, he signifies greater years; if in Succedents, meaner years; if in Cadents, lesseryears. The lesser years of Saturn are thirty, the meaner are forty four years, and the greaterfifty eight. The lesser years of Jupiter are twelve, the meaner years forty, and the greateraccordingly are forty seven. The lesser years of Mars are fifteen, his meane years forty, andthe greater years forty seven. The lesser years of the Sun are nineteen, his mean years fortyfive, and his greater years eighty two. The lesser years of Venus are eight, her mean years"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"3forty five, and her greater years eighty two. Mercury's lesser years are twenty, his meanyears forty nine, and his greater years eighty. The lesser years of the Moon are fifteen, hermean years thirty nine, and her greater years a hundred and seven. And also look if Marsor Saturn shall be in the first House, and the Lord of the eighth with them; and if the Sunshall be in the eighth, the Querent shall not live: likewise if the Lord of the Ascendentshall happen to be void of course, and Mars be in the eighth, the Querent shall not live;but if the Sun and the Moon shall be in conjunction in the seventh House, and Venus in thesecond, he shall live well.The accidents of the nativity are likewise to be considered. If you finde Saturn or Mer-cury in the first, * he is foolish and talkative; if it be Mars and Mercury, he will not be ser-vile, but a wrangler and scoffer; if the Sun and Mercury, he will be a speaker of truth; and ifthe Sun be in Aries, he will apply himself to learn whatsoever he shall hear; if Ve n u s be inthe seventh, he will be luxurious; and if Saturn, Mercury and Venus be in their fall, he willbe a Sodomite; if the Sun and Venus be in the tenth, and the Moon in the first, he will bevery liberal; if Ve n u s, Mercury and the Dragons Head be in the first, he wilt be covetous; ifthe Moon and Mars be in the first, he will be subject to great bondage; and if Mars be Lordof the nativity, he will he rich, and an evil speaker, and litigious; and if the Sun be in thefirst, he will be envious, having a fair body, not very lean, nor very fat; and if Venus be inthe first, he will be white and fair; if Mercury be in the first, he will not be stable, butalwayes in motion; but if the Moon be found there, it denotes him to have a graceful face,brest and arms; if Saturn be there, the man will be black and filthy; if Jupiter, he will have around face, a fair forehead, a ruddy complexion mixt with a little white. If you would know his office or art: if the Moon be in the seventh with Saturn, or in thefourth, or in the tenth, or in the first, It is not good for him to build any house in a City,nor to build a ship, neither is it good for him to be a tiller of land, or to dress vines, orplant trees; but to be imployed about some office belonging to the water, or concerningmarriages, or to be a Post or a Messenger; neither let him apply himself much to his mas-ter, because he shall gain no repute from him: if the Moon be in the fifth or third, it will begood to him; in the second, eighth, sixth and twelfth, neither good nor evil.Jupiter signifies Bishops, Prelates, Nobles, Potentates, Judges, Wise men, Merchantsand Usurers.Mars signifies Warriors, Incendiaries, Homicides, Physitians, Barbers, Hangmen,Gold-smiths, Cooks, furnaces, and all fireworks. And if Mars be in strong Signes, he willbe poor and die in captivity, unless he put himself in arms with some souldier or vassal.The Sun signifieth Emperors, Kings, Princes, Nobles, Lords and Judges.Ve n u s signifies Queens and Ladies, Marriages, Communications, Friendship, Apothe-caries, Taylors, and such as make Ornaments for playes, sellers of Cloth, Jesters, Vintners,Players at dice, Whores and Robbers.Mercury signifies Clerks, Philosophers, Astrologers, Geometricians Arithmeticians,Latine writers, and Painters, and all subtil Artists, as well men as women, and their Arts."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"4Concerning the intention of the Querent, look unto the Signe ascending, and his Lord;and where you finde the Lord of the Ascendent, he comes to inquire about something per-taining to that House; and if the Sun be Lord of the Ascendent, his Question is concern-ing fear which he is in of some man; if Venus, he enquireth of Arts, that he may knowsome proper Arts, or he enquireth concerning things belonging to women. If Mercury beLord of the Ascendent, he seek after something that is lost, or enquireth concerning someinfirmity. If the Moon he seeketh also for something lost, or inquireth about sickness, orsome disease in his eyes. If Saturn be Lord of the Ascendent, he enquireth about somesickness, or concerning a Prince; and keepeth silence, but hast some great grief or anguishin his heart. If Jupiter be Lord of the Ascendent, his Question is concerning some infir-mity, or restitution, or for some office which he desireth to have.

And if an evil Planet be in the second, it's to berecovered: But if Mercury be in the second, so that he be his Lord, and bringeth contrari-ety, then it shall be recovered; and if a good Planet be in the second House, he signifiesrecovery, although he be the Lord thereof.Mark therefore the concord and discord of the Planets: the Moon and Jupiter arefriends, the Moon and Mars enemies; Mercury and the Sun are friends, Mercury and Venusenemies; Venus and Jupiter are friends, Jupiter and the Moon are enemies.The Planets are said to be friends, when they agree in one nature and quality, as Marsand the Sun, because both their natures is hot and dry; Venus and the Moon do agree incold and moisture: or when Planets do agree in substance and nature, as Jupiter and Venusare friends: or when the House of one is the exaltation of another, or on the contrary.

Consider also the Planets, and their places, which if they bein strong Houses, the things which are signified by those Planets will be rare: and note,That Saturn doth signifie fields, vines, and instruments to work in fields, and leather, andof fruits, corn, acorns, oak-apples, and pomegranates.

And if Saturn be there, she loveth another; but he lieth not with her. And if theDragons Tail be in the seventh, he lieth with her. And if Jupiter be there, she hardly con-taineth herself chaste. If Venus, she is merry, and much given to play and laughter, by rea-son whereof, she may be accounted a whore, and is not so. If Mercury be in the seventh,she had a lover, but now hath none.

And note, that in a Question concerning war and kingdom, it is said that there ismore power and efficacie, or fortitude in the exaltation of a Planet, then in his House; butin all other Questions the contrary.If you would be informed concerning any one being that is gone to any fight, whetherhe shall return safe, see the Lord of the Ascendent; if he be good, that is, with good Plan-ets, and a good Planet in the first, he will return safe; but if the Sun be with the Lord ofthe first, in any part of the Question, let him not go, because the Sun burneth him.

See likewise if there be an evil Planet in the eighth, becausethen death is to be feared. And if the Sun be with the Lord of the seventh, or in theeighth, it signifies that it is ill to go. The like judgement is of the seventh and the tenth.And if a Question be proposed concerning the event of War, see the seventh and thefirst, and their Lords: for the first House and his Lord signifies the Querent; and the sev-enth House and his Lord the adversary. So that if there be good Planets in the first andevil in the seventh; and if the Lord of the first and seventh be evil, the Querent shall over-come: but if there be an evil Planet with the Lord of the first, and an evil Planet in thefirst, and the Lord of the seventh good, or * R. * in the seventh, the Querent shall be over-come, or taken, or slain. And if the Lords of them both be in the first, and there be goodPlanets from the part of the first House, unto the end of the House which is the middle ofthe Question, and if evil Planets do possess the other half of the Question, that is to sayfrom the seventh unto the end of the twelfth house, the adversary shall overcome. But ifboth the Lords shall be in the Ascendent, and if they be good from the part of the first,and evil from the part of the seventh, they shall both suffer great loss; but the Querentshall have the better in the end.
