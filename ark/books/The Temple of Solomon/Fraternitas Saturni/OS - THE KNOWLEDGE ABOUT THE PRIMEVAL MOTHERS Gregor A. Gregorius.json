Regarding the names of the Primeval Mothers given at the end of this article I suspect that the person or persons that placed this article in the original German version on the internet deliberately changed those names. THE KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THE PRIMEVAL MOTHERS (Original German title: Das Wissen über die Ur-Mütter) by Gregor A. Gregorius The knowledge about the Primeval Mothers is high Wisdom. Even the Altmeister (old master) Johann Wolfgang Goethe, whose occult and esoteric roots come from his friend and privy councilor Karl von Eckhartshausen from whom Goethe learned, only speaks very vaguely about it. All the researches about Goethe have not found anything regarding the mothers. Probably even Goethe, only had a partial visionary knowledge about it, which he was not able to fully experience. Goethe himself was in his Lodge not a holder of a higher wisdom degree in spite of his excitingly esoteric and mystical disposition. In the archive of the Lodge FRATERNITAS SATURNI we find the following explanations: The Primeval Mothers are power centers in the etheric body of the Earth-Spirit! They are his centralized Chakras, which as cosmic reflective vortexes that are being continually fed by the inflowing emissions of the fixed stars of the Pleorma. "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"The human being with its seven-fold etheric body is indeed an exact analogy of the Earth-Spirit. Also in the human being the etheric Chakras are being exited by receiving finer sensations, which then lets the ego vibrate because of the contact with the incoming cosmic emanations. In moments of an inner concentration which is reached by meditative contemplation, visionary realizations arise from the depth consciousness which make contact with the higher spheres. However at first the transmutation happens trough the transcendent earth-Spirit body and its corresponding centers. In this manner, for the human being, a direct connection is created with the primal-powers of the Mothers. The Primeval Mothers are therefore principles of activities which in collective coupling work together in a harmonic completion and harmony according to their primeval pictures of the planet spheres. But then again these spheres of the planets are only gateways, and the planets are only nodal points for the forming transcendental primal powers from the zodiac. For this reason the Primeval Mothers have in their particular level of existence their own image and roots. In the outer, first appearance and correspondence they are in the third saturnian power-circle as only causal working energies and from there they build the first mental manifestations in the upper and lower Rupa-level according to the cosmic Image and Form law. Arguably there they only appear as symbols but yet they are already a hidden power inside a kernel, for a planned astral formation which in its saturnian basis first needs an accumulation of Venus and Jupiter vibrations, and the trough the powers attracted by Mars and Moon in the Kamaloka manifest in pictorial form manifest in a pure astral crystallization as an incarnation of demonic power which unfolds itself and influences therefore humanity because of the fundamental cosmic primal power. For this reason the astral Primeval Mothers are positive-negative based beings with strong creative impulses, but yet who have within the sphere of the earth-spirit always the motherly creative powers that dominate, it is a primal power that is always is giving birth and obeys the incoming rays. "},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"This way through the realm of the Mother, the Mothers create the Earth-being – nature – by themselves. Through the Primeval Mothers the creative human being receives the creative drive or action, according to the sphere that touches him and with which chakra he receives and works. Herein is the guideline for the creation of a corresponding impulse and therefore the basis for his drive to action. This reflection has the strongest influence in the female gender through the sphere of the zodiacal sign of Cancer and the transforming powers of the Moon. The initiated Magus makes use of the powers of the Primeval Mothers by magical invocations, by either forcing with ritual magical the forms of the demonic Primal Mother in the Kama Loka or he tries to reach the Primeval Mother in Sukhavat. Both methods are possible and appropriate. The Names of Primeval Mothers are not mentioned in profane circles. They are also variable and change with the times in the religious cults, in the mysteries and in the magical secret teachings. Eve the Primeval Mother transforms into Erda – Venus into Isis – Lilith into Astarte etc. But the 12 Primeval Mothers, respectively eight of them are still reachable by the magically trained person, because through them he can created and accomplish things consciously and unconsciously. For this reason the initiated Magus uses the powers of the Primeval Mother in his magical practices. The lunar-venusian power of the woman is able to give birth astrally. For this it is necessary to have high initiations because it is in the nature of the astral Primeval Mothers to serve the male beings or to destroy them, which again is a deep secret – the cosmically anchored hate between the genders. A trained initiates Magus of a high degree will not succumb. Only Nah – e – ma one is not allowed to call --------the Primeval Mother of Death!
