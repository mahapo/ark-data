[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"CHRONICLE OF THE LODGE FRATERNITAS SATURNI By Mastr. Giovanni Translated into English by Richard Tschudi From old annals it is known that from the end of the 17th to the Beginning of the 18th century, there existed a Brotherhood of Saturn in Denmark and Sweden. This Brotherhood had only a few members and they led a hidden existence. They studied mainly Mysticism, Alchemy and Esoteric subjects. A high spiritual attainment was expected and demanded from its members. Their researches were based on a pure mathematical foundation, therefore practiced classical Greek recognition principles. The origin of the Brotherhood and the inspiration behind its teachings are traceable to a secret Master from Tashkent, in Central Asia. Unfortunately there are no records of the development or extension of the Order. Research shows no mention of their existence at the end of the 18th century. It is possible that they were victims of the intellectual atmosphere of the age. Later a Brotherhood of Saturn reappeared in Poland. It was under the guidance of the well known mathematician Hoene-Wronski (born 1778 in Poland, died 1853 in France). {New research shows that Hoene-Wronski was the principal teacher of Eliphas Levi}. The headquarters of this Polish Saturn Brotherhood was in Warsaw, but it seems that this Brotherhood also disappeared, again because of social and political unrest. In the year 1921 the book dealer and editor Eugen Grosche by order of Master .'.Recnartus (Heinrich Traenker), Grandmaster of the Rosicrucian movement in Germany and its affiliated Orders, founded the Pansophia Lodge – Orient Berlin. Master .'.Pacitus (UFA architect"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Albin Grau) was appointed Master of the Chair of the Orient Berlin, Frater .'.Gregorius was nominated Secretary of the Lodge. The Lodge was ritually installed by Master .'.Recnartus. In the year 1925 a secret conference which lasted several days was held in Thuringia, Germany. The following persons took part at the conference: Master .'.Recnartus as the Grandmaster of the German Rosicrucian movement and its affiliated orders. Master .'.Therion (Aleister Crowley) as world-master of the O.T.O and Grandmaster of the A.'. A.'. Master .'.Pacitus as Master of the Chair of the Pansopia Lodge Frater .'.Gregorius as Lodge Secretary of the Ponsophia Lodge. As well as 10 other delegates of different Secret Societies. During this conference a complete breach developed between Master .'.Therion and Master .'.Recnartus. The actions taken by Master .'.Recnartus were not sanctioned by the members of the Orient Berlin of the Pansophia Lodge, because they were a contravention against esoteric laws. Master .'.Pacitus demanded that Master.'.Recnartus resigns his post as Grandmaster of the Pansophia Lodge and the Rosicrucian movement. However Master .'.Recnartus refused to comply with this demand. Because of Master .'.Renartus refusal to step down as the Grandmaster of the Pansoshia Lodge, the Orient Berlin of the Pansophia dissolved itself with a great solemn ritual. A short time later the former members of the Pansophia Lodge – Orient Berlin, held a meeting in which they deliberated if they should unite again to form a new Lodge with the name \"Fraternitas Saturni\". This new Lodge would have no formal association with the A.'. A.'. of Master .'.Therion; but it would recognize the Law of Thelema as embodied in the \"Book of the Law\" as guiding principle. A vote was held on this proposal. The result of the vote was that one third of the former members were not willing to follow this new spiritual course. Among those not willing to follow this course was also Master .'.Pacitus. However the overwhelming majority, about 40"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"members voted in favour of the proposal and they elected the former Lodge Secretary.'.Gregorius as Master of the Chair of the Orient Berlin. With this vote and election the \"Fraternitas Saturni\" was born. The official installation of the \"Fraternitas Saturni\" took place Easter Sunday 1928. Since the new Lodge as an organisation was not under the rulership of Master .'.Therion (Aleister Crowley) and the A.'. A.'. The \"Fraternitas Saturni became by nature a Grand Lodge and it started working in the spirit of the coming Aeon i.e. the new Age of Aquarius.The Lodge published the periodical \"Saturn Gnosis\", which was its publication-organ; it also published Lodge school lectures for different Grades, the \"Magical Letters\" and many other relevant literatures. In the year 1933 the \"Fraternitas Saturni\" as well as other important Lodges and societies were prohibited by the NSDAP (Nazional Sozialistische Deutsche Arbeiter Partei). Most of the leader of those organisations was arrested one by one. Master .'.Gregorius avoided arrest and in 1936 he emigrated to Switzerland. The other leading members of the \"Fraternitas Saturni\" were also able to escape to foreign countries. Dr. Lietke went to China. Dr. Bruno to Ceylon, Edgar Weiss turned toward Palestine and Dr. Hunwalth went to Paris. After 2 years in Switzerland Master .'.Gregorius moved on to Cannero, Italy. Although his stay in Italy was approved by the foreign ministry of Italy, Master .'.Gregorius was expelled from Italy in 1942 at the instigation of the NSDAP. When he returned to Germany he was arrested in October 1942 by the Nazis. After one year imprisonment he was released on parole after signing a statement promising not to get involved in active Lodge work. During his stay in Switzerland and Italy, Master .'.Gregorius was able to stay in touch with the majority of the members of the Lodge. Although under most difficult circumstances. This enabled him to reunite the brothers after the war ended in 1945 and to reorganize the Lodge. By that time Master .'.Gregorius was living in Riesa (Soviet occupied Germany). The political situation there however, restricted his activities. In July 1950 Master .'.Gregorius had to flee to the West in order to save his freedom. He took up residence in West-Berlin where he was soon able to bring back the Lodge back to full blossom. On March 18th 1957 Master .'.Gregor A.
