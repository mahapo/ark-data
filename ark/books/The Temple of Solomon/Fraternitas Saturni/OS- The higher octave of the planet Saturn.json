[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"THE HIGHER OCTAVE OF THE PLANET SATURN An esoteric contemplation By ∴Gregor A. Gregorius∴ (Note by the translater. This short text was absolutely difficult to translate. It was written in a way German is not spoken today in 2014. The sentences in the German original are convoluted, longwinded and the subject matter is difficult to understand. In order to make it more readable it would have to be completely re-written. But then some points would perhaps be lost. I hope in the future some more competent translators will do a better job. In the mean time I hope some of the readers will get something out of it anyway. Feedback to this article actually would be appreciated. R.T) There, where the subtilized mental vibrations of the Arupa level, in their subtle action bring the human ego, who has been upwardly re-polarized by the ability of a pure spiritually founded perception, by intuition or inspiration to the borderline of the intellectual cognitive faculty, there at the border of the causal level there starts the dominion of the Great Demiurge Saturn. There he vibrates as the Guardian of the Threshold in the dark-green light in his higher octave. As the ego, in its spiritual development, has reached the dark portal of Saturn, only then it has been deemed mature enough to step over the threshold to higher realizations which lie beyond the spheres behind it. Then Saturnus the Guardian of the Threshold, the lord of karma lowers the torch of dead. In this beautiful symbolism, the earnest countenance of the Great Demiurge changes into a kind, understanding and liberating smile and everything lies in a dark-green twilight which surrounds him. – In this way the last big initiation for the adept of the green hour and the rituals of the green twilight will be disclosed, the secrets of the adepts of the green Saturnmoon, whose symbol is not the roses on the cross but the sublime beauty of the white lilies. Liberated from the burdening karma, redeemed from the terrestrial gravity,"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"the ego is beginning it further journey which lead to far away spheres which vibrate in the light-blue light of Uranus. This Great Demiurge Saturnus does not have much in common with the astrological Saturn. That planet is a material manifestation in chain of planets and represents in his tense atomic structure the lower octave of the planet-being Saturn. Here, the generally valid, disharmonic aspects and their hindering and destructive actions aspects of the planetary being Saturn of the planetary being can be felt, depending on the position and aspects of Saturn in the natal horoscope chart. It is necessary that an esoterisist has this knowledge and understanding! To see Saturn as a pure evil principle and as a manifestation of the devil is nonsense and ignorant, it is proof of little realization. As the ego has crossed the threshold of the guardian and has entered the causal level is dwells now in the world of causes, of causal events, the source of all things and is active as creator, as an impulse giving spiritual being, which is able to send its fertilizing emanations into the mental sphere. The cognition of the mental powers and their mastery he is permitted to know and such an ego can and will constructively work further in his now dominating creative urge and can also be used for itself for en even higher development towards the absolute. More and higher levels or spheres await him to complete the cosmic spiral that has been stipulated for him. For such a high degree of development there are no more rules no matter what a high magic it is because the high universal powers cannot be reached by a human being. He only can perceive a reflection of those powers and even only after many downward transforming and re-polarisations. No more paths are shown to him; no more teachings are given to him. There are no more protective devises. He is completely left for himself, a creative being on the highest level only open for extraterrestrial, cosmic irradiations in close contact with the absolute by means if its visual powers.. Even if very knowledgeable people would unite themselves to a brother chain they would not reach this maturity because each individual has to walk this path of high realization by himself. There is not method for research; each question gets extinguished in the darkness of non-understanding. Here only help for parts of the path high rituals of adoration. These rituals of the dark green light in the Saturnian twilight are so secret and will never and have never been published. Even in the epoch of Lemuria they were deemed as a high or deep secret of an initiated priesthood, as"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"foundation of a high Moon cult. Even the priest of Atlantis in the first or second epoch of Atlantis probably knew these rituals but they did not practice them have not handed down these rituals because the religion of Atlantis was built on a high Sun cult. Only the early time of the Egyptian epoch and strangely in Madagascar and in Polynesia the researching esotericist can find some rudiments of this ancient wisdom in the moon cultures which were handed down there. – But he who still believes to the god of Christianity and his son is not mature enough for these higher realizations and have not passed over the threshold of Saturn. A member of the Saturn brotherhood, he who has received the consecration as a Master, knows and is convinced because of his applied practices, that the creative Saturnian magical impulses can be applied in a constructive but also destructive manner. Here there is no middle way. It is the same power that is applied. Only the will of the magus is crucial. Here start the beginning paths of the black of white magic. One can pervert these cosmic Saturnian powers and apply them for destruction but also for blessing bringing construction. – However for a person who stand in the service of Saturn, and who has realized him in his higher octave, for him there exists only a pure Saturnian ethic which is founded on the understanding and realization, which to be sure does not forgive, does not forget but perceives and values that making of mistakes is necessary in order to reach inner and higher maturity. A master in the Saturnian light can rightly be deemed as a ruler of the lower or of the upper light, because he has the ability to project his creative impulses either into the mental spheres but also into the pure astral worlds. He is standing beyond good and evil. The law of the new aeon: Do what thou wilt applies for him also and of course he is responsible for his actions to the higher powers. Lucifer – Saturn is a high cosmic being and his servants or brothers have to be very conscious of their responsibilities so that they do not slide down to the lower octave and there become tools of the demonic powers and not creative designers. It is true the human being can by conscious control of the negative or also the positive pole in magic reach the peaks of human realization and through this is lead to on lonely high paths to crystal clear realizations beyond good and evil but he also sees in himself the laws of harmony of the cosmic envelopment which"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"compliance is absolutely necessary for his inner maturity. For him it is always important to build the bridge or the overcoming and solution of most of the dominating inner tensions. Mysticism can only be a guidepost says rightly” “God has a bright and a dark countenance from the beginning. – This word “God”, which generally only hides a “not-knowing” as an excuse, is only a designation of the great oneness, the absolute, the zero point energy the un-researchable which lies behind everything. Here the human thinking, the intellect reaches are set absolute limits. However the knowing human being, who is standing in the pure Saturnian light, is immune towards the religious and conventional ethical and moralistic suggestions that are floating trough the world and prevent the ascent to higher realizations. He knows that event the deepest sorrow matures him through the experience and that the path that he follows into the solitariness distant from other human beings still leads him to an, beautiful, inner felicity. In the first paragraph of this article Gregorius talks about the Arupa level or Arupa plan. Here below is a little explanation from the Encyclopedia Britannica abut this subject for your perusal. arūpa-loka Written by The Editors of Encyclopædia Britannica arūpa-loka, (Sanskrit and Pāli: “world of immaterial form”), in Buddhist thought, the highest of the three spheres of existence in which rebirth takes place. The other two are rūpa-loka, “the world of form,” and kāma-loka, “the world of feeling” (the three are also referred to as arūpa-dhātu, rūpa-dhātu, and kāma-dhātu, the “realms” of formlessness, form, and feeling). In arūpa-loka, existence depends on the stage of concentration attained, and there are four levels: the infinity of space, the infinity of thought, the infinity of nonbeing, and the infinity of neither consciousness nor nonconsciousness. The rūpa-loka, which is free from sensuous desire but is still conditioned by form, is inhabited by gods. It is also further subdivided into the spheres inhabited by Brahmā, by the luminous deities,"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"by the blissful gods, and by the deities of great fruits. Kāma-loka includes the six heavens of the lesser gods and the five lower worlds (the worlds of men, demons, ghosts, animals, and purgatory). As superior as is rebirth in the higher worlds, such an existence is nonetheless temporary, subject to change, and involves the fundamental conflicts of existence within the limits of transmigration. This can be broken only by further spiritual insight, resulting in Nirvāṇa and release from the cycle of rebirths. "}]
