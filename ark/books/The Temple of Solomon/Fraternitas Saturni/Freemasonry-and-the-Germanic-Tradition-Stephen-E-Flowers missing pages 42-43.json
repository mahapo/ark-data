It is partly a translation of acontribution by Guido von List to the study of Freemasonry, partly apersonal memoir, partly a call to action, but most of all it is a basicintroductory study of a topic that would really require many volumes totreat completely. The topic is that of the Germanic roots of the Masonictradition. In this study I do not want to suggest that all of Masonicimagery and symbolism, or that the entirety of Masonic ritual, are simplylifted from ancient Germanic customs. Obviously there have beencenturies of intentional efforts to make Masonic customs appear to havetheir origins in the Holy Land and to be linked to Old Testament themes.However, the facts seem to point simply and directly to a more \"homegrown\" well-spring for the most basic and most original levels of thesecustoms and rituals. These facts were well-known over a hundred yearsago, and were discussed in some detail in a book by the AmericanMasonic scholar George Fort in his 1884 book Early History andAntiquities of Freemasonry, subtitled As Connected with Ancient NorseGuilds, and the Oriental and Mediceval Building Fraternities.Our little book begins with a personal memoir that details my ownbrush with the Masonic Order and how it ended badly, but predictably.This is followed by the main body of the work consisting of two chapters.The first details the historical aspects of the question while the next delvesmore into specific themes of myth and ritual which have definiteGermanic roots. Appended to this is an article written in 1910 by Guidovon List, which touches on the Germanic origin of Masonic symbolism.The book concludes with a call to action for all men possessed of the ideaof tradition to make the effort to become a Mason and thereby revivifythis dying institution.Stephen Edred FlowersWoodharrowJuly 4, 3008"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"My Masonic (Mis-)AdventureBackgroundIn order to understand my exploration of the Masonic Order onemust have some background. It did not come lightly, nor did it comewithout my eyes being open to its eventual outcome. The events are bothinstructive and amusing.One of the several things I knew about my grandfather, thatgrandfather I never met because he died some eight years before I wasborn, was that he was a Mason. His name was Edred and I was namedafter him. In my subsequent explorations of the esoteric, the fact that mygrandfather had been a Mason — as well as a Knight of the KKK, as therobes found in a chest after his death demonstrated — loomed in thebackground of my own search for the Mysterious.Another important figure in my life was Edgar Polome, the professorwho supervised my dissertation, Runes and Magic, which made him, inthe parlance of German academia, my Doktorvater. Several times hediscussed with me his involvement with Freemasonry in his nativeBelgium. In one of these discussions he revealed to me that in theteachings of his lodge, the Master Mason degree and the legend of HiramAbifff were interpreted in Light of the Myth of the Germanic God Baldur.He also made it known that his own religious personal view was mostcharacterized by a search for the Light. These words would also guide mein the future.In general I avoided involvement with Masonry because I had cometo understand that it was largely devoid of any real teaching anymore, andthat its members were largely conservative Christians with littleUnderstanding of what it was they were doing. At the same time I wasfully aware from early on that Freemasonic ritual and structure werelargely based on old guild customs and organizational principles. This iswhy I did some research in the late 1970s which acted as a basis forcertain features of the ritual and structure of the Rune-Gild.My Wewelsburg Working, October 2005In October of 2005 the Rune-Gild held a World Gild-Moot inSchleswig, Germany. After that gathering was concluded I made amagical pilgrimage to the castle Wewelsburg. I had tried to arrange somesort of \"official\" formalities with the government authorities nowresponsible for the castle, infamous for its role as training facility for the11"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"SS.(l) As a part of this official visit, I would symbolically and operativelyrebuke the role of Anti-Semitism in the history of the place, thus lendingthe weight of my own authority to combating this negative aspect of thehistory of the place. As such, I would have thought that officials interestedin diffusing this dark cloud hanging over contemporary German life andsociety would have welcomed such an pronouncement from someone inmy supposed position. However, I was told that officials would only meetwith me in Paderborn, well away from the castle, and that any officialappearance to the visit would be impossible. I rejected their offer. As afurther excuse they gave that there had been a number of \"satanic\"murders done there in the recent past, and they feared reprisals from thepress if they met with me on the grounds of the castle! (These \"murders\"are the stuff of urban legend.) So I carried on with a more candlestineform of operation. (The rebuking of Anti-Semitism was not part of theoperation, as this aspect of the operation was contingent upon some formof official sanction for its effectiveness.)The results of the Wewelsburg Working were these: 1) That theground-space at Woodharrow should be turned into an \"instrument ofinitiation,\" a school for self-development, and 2) a linkage should be madeto a tradition. These two results were separate and distinct on one level,but somehow bound on another. The second part led me to conclude thatit was perhaps Freemasonry that was intended. Why? It was somethingwhich was linked to my own background, culturally and genetically, aswell as being a part of the initiation of one of my own major initiators. Itwas a genuine, if moribund tradition. In some way too, perhaps a rivinglinkage could be made back to the forms which first informed thestructures of the ancient gild of rune-masters.Omens and Good RedeBefore I proceeded to make contact with the Masonic Order in myown local area, I sought out corroborating omens and hail-signs. Theoracle of the sixteen runes used in conjunction with the Havamal definitelywarned against the undertaking as a dead-end. The Old Man has,however, been in the habit of testing me in some of these avenues, so Ipersevered. I also sought the rede (advice) of wise-heads, both of whomwere known by me to be Masons of high degree. One told me to forgeahead, as there was nothing in the traditions of Masonry that whichdisqualify me. There are, of course, many customs in present-dayMasonry which an Odian might find objectionable, e.g. swearing on aBible. But at the same time, I, as a historian of the craft, knew that thesewere only latter-day symbols for something which I understood to bemuch older and true. The other wise-head warned me that Masons nowgenerally represent the most conservative element one will find in anygiven community, and that I should take his into account as I dealt withthe Masons in general.12Approaching the OrderAs I knew a local Mason, an elderly man who had worked for uswhen we moved to Woodharrow in 1993,1 inquired of him as to how toapproach the Lodge locally. I had given this gentleman one of mybooks— the translation of Guido von List's The Secret of the Runes — asit contains a few references to Masonry. I was invited to visit the lodge toattend the dinner that preceded the Loge Work that took place at so-called stated meetings. Such stated meetings occur regularly once amonth.The local lodge is in a newer building in a somewhat remote part ofthe small town of Smithville, Texas. It is basically a metal building that hadbeen erected in the 1970s. Previously, the Masonic Lodge in town was inthe most permanent building on Main Street. As the order had dwindledin financial reserves, it was forced to sell the prominent building and moveto a more remote and modest location. It should be noted that theMasonic Order owns lodges in virtually every American town of any sizeat all—literally thousands of them.Part of the lodge building was a sort of kitchen-dinning hall space.Contrary to what might have been expected, both the Masonic brothersand their wives shared in this part of the activity. Many of the womenwere also members of the Order of the Eastern Star, the women'sauxiliary organization to the Masons.Upon meeting this group of Masons, there were perhaps thirty peoplein all present at the first meeting, one was at once struck by the advancedage of these people. I would say the average age of the people wassomewhere in the late 70s. (In the few months I was associated with thelodge two or three of them died.) There were a few members who werecloser to my own age, one or two even younger. They seemed to comefrom all sorts of backgrounds. Conversation was for the most partmundane, with any forays into anything more \"spiritual\" firmly withinthe Biblical tradition.The brothers were most impressed when I produced my grandfather'sMasonic monitor from 1922. A monitor is an abbreviated guide toMasonic ritual, easily carried on one's person.Subsequent to my initial contact an interview process was initiated.Three Masons were to interview me in my home before we could gofurther. The interview took place in the Hall at Woodharrow where thebanner of the Gild is on permanent display. During the interview Iexplained that I was not a Christian, but rather an Odian. The Masonicbrothers there were all in agreement that as long as a Supreme Being wasacknowledged, in my case Odin and or the Germanic gods, all was inorder.InitiationAn Entered Apprentice rite was scheduled for me on June 21, 2006.The rite was conducted, and a general impression of its contents can be13"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"gained from Duncan's Ritual. It should be noted that every state in theUnited States and all different countries have slightly different forms ofthese rituals.What was remarkable about this experience is what I willed to beremarkable about it. In participating in this ritual, in this ritualized space, Iwas undergoing the exact same forms of symbolic actions that mygrandfather had undergone, or that many previous generations of Masonshad undergone for two or more centuries before. In this process I felt thata link had been reestablished between the current Rune-Gild and the rootsof the Gild in certain ancient forms shared between the Gild and the ritesof Freemasonry.My Entered Apprentice ritual was attended by a standing room onlycrowd. It seemed that my reputation as a writer and scholar had precededme. At the conclusion of my initiation I gave a short talk on tradition. Iwas struck by the resonant participation in the actions, the movementsand the general elements of space in the lodge. My experience resonatedover time and space with all those who had undergone them in the past.A link was forged. The Light was seen.After this experience there began a period of learning for an exam.This exam would cover a good deal of material which had to bememorized, and which could not be written down. I would meet with myinstructor, Brother-X, we will call him, about once a week, and thismaterial would be provided orally and repeated verbatim until it wascommitted to memory.It was about this time when the new edition of my book on theFraternitas Saturni was issued by Runa-Raven. After my extensivediscussion and conversations with Brother-X, which included a discussionof pseudo-Masonry, such as the FS and the Golden Dawn, I determinedthat the text of the FS-book would not be \"offensive\" to him. In themeeting prior to my giving him the book, and at the meeting when Iactually handed it to him, I emphasized, truthfully, that I was not amember of the FS, and that the book is a purely academic study of theorder in question.He looked through the book, and there was a continued briefdiscussion of its contents. At this meeting, also, we determined that it wasabout time for my Entered Apprentice test, where I would recite thememorized material we had been working on.This meeting took place around noon at the lodge. The next day,around 2:00 PM Brother-X called and said that my EA exam wasscheduled for the next day. A couple of hours later he called back and leftanother message saying that the previously scheduled exam had beencanceled, and that I should call him. We were to meet the followingMonday at the lodge, as usual.I arrived a bit early. When he pulled up, he got out of his car and heldout the book to me as if he was trying to feed meat to man-eating tiger.First he said, \"Here take, this book, I can't have it around me.\" It was14apparently \"bad juju\" in his superstition-filled world. He then said that hecould no longer teach me, and that if I wanted to go on, I would have tosee if anyone else in the lodge would be agreeable to do so, which hedoubted, considering the despicable contents of this book I had written.Clearly he was tyrannically making the decision that I was to be shunned.It seemed that what bothered him most, or what he said bothered himmost, were certain \"graphic\" pictures. (One actually does show awoman's breast, if you use a magnifying glass.) At that point I did lecturehim in no uncertain terms concerning the extreme lack of enlightenedthinking he demonstrated — he behaved no batter than a superstition-filled savage — hardly the initiatory product of centuries of Freemasonry.The next day I wrote a letter of resignation to the Worshipful Master.From my experience with hierarchical groups I knew that none would\"come to my defense.\" Brother-X was a high-ranking member of thelodge; I had not even taken my first degree. It did not matter that he hadremained untouched by the meaning of Masonry. That is just the wayhierarchical groups work, and the way they must work. Sometimes thingsget lost, but in the long-run there is no substitute for the utility ofhierarchy for such groups. They cannot function without it, and Iunderstand this.In the final analysis, given my position and notoriety, it was reallyperhaps only a matter of time before these \"most conservative\" and oftennowadays \"Bible-thumping\" Masons would have found me out, and Iwould have been rejected anyway. No one would ever see the irony thatthese old gentlemen had long since lost the inner meaning of Masonry andthat what I represent is far more like what the original free-thinking,adventurous, revolutionary and even radical Masons represented. At thispoint, as one wise-head said, Masonry represents cultural conservatism. Itoriginally represented transformation and freedom. It fought superstitionand tyranny; it did not represent these things in the world.In the final part of this book I will put out the call for a renewal ofMasonry, not just in the old Germanic spirit which first spawned theorder, but in the universal sense of the first modern speculative Masonswho represented a brotherhood of all worthy men.1 For more on the Wewelsburg and its role in esotericism during the National Socialistregime in Germany, see the book The Secret King (Feral House, 2007).15"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"Roots of Masonryin the Scandinavian Gild SystemHistoryWhen we begin to approach the history of anything, we have to besure that we know what it is we even mean by the word \"history.\" It hasonly been recently that an academic science called history has beendeveloped. To be sure there were pioneers in the kind of history themodern academic admires, e.g. the Greek Herodotus (5th century BCE)—called \"The Father of History.\" History in the academic sense is thegathering of usually written or otherwise recorded data, placing it in achronological order and subjecting the resulting narrative to the analysisof reason. This is not the only kind of history, however. There is alsotraditional history. This is a narrative handed down from generation togeneration which perhaps has no basis in hard historical data, but which ascome to be believed by generations of people, and has thus greatly shapedthose people's lives and their perceptions of who they are.In postmodern theory, even so-called academic history has been seento reflect a myth of its own. This myth is rooted in linear andchronological thinking and the reasonable analysis of this chronology hasalso been seen as a mythic metanarrative of its own.In the final analysis when dealing with \"history,\" one must take bothtradition and rational analysis into account. Most importantly, one mustseek out lost traditions, which might have explained historical facts betterthan traditions which might have been added later under influences distantfrom the original idea.17"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Traditional Masonic HistoryAlthough there is what must be called traditional history in the lore ofFreemasonry, it is far from monolithic. There are various traditions andstreams of tradition found in the Freemasonic world. In Mackey's RevisedEncyclopedia of Freemasonry twelve different possible points of originfor Masonry are delineated. (Vol II, p. 744) The most important \"official\"or traditional points of origin are connected to King Solomon's Templeand its construction by the archetypal Mason, Hiram Abiff. The nextimportant impetus comes from the period of the Crusades and theKnights Templar.The most universal tradition among the Masons is the story of HiramAbiff, who is seen as the master builder responsible for the construction ofSolomon's Temple. Biblical accounts (I Kings and Chronicles n)) mentionHiram of Tyre as a worker in brass and as someone who fitted out notonly the Temple but Solomon's palace as well with costly ornaments.However, in Masonic lore he is the master builder. He organized theworkers to build the Temple and when he refused to give up certain signsof recognition to a group of low-level workers, he was murdered. It is hisdeath and symbolic resurrection which is the myth underlying the MasterMason Ritual.Solomon's Temple was completed around 953 BCE. This structurewas destroyed by the Babylonians in 587 BCE. The Jews, with the help ofthe Persians, built a new Temple in 515 BCE. This structure was largelydismantled by the Jews themselves under Herod the Great and rebuiltbetween 7 BCE and 4 CE. Renovations were done to the Temple making itmore magnificent and more in line with the esthetics of the Greco-Romanworld this third version of the Temple was eventually destroyed by theRomans in 70 CE. On its ruins the Emperor Hadrian built a Temple ofJupiter, which itself fell into ruins. By the time of the Crusades, hardly atrace of it remained.The original plan of the Temple appears below:HolyofHoiksSuoctuaryPorchPlan of the Temple of Solomon18Another time when the Temple in Jerusalem played an important partin Masonic history was supposedly when, during the Crusades, theTemple ruins were won over once more to Christendom. A GermanMasonic account presented in the Signal Star reads:At the time of the [Crusades] under the rule of William H, whenBalduin was king of Jerusalem, many noble Scots were persuaded togo along to the Holy Land. They arrived in Jerusalem in 1089, alongwith the great armies that almost all of Christendom was sending atthat time, under the leadership of Robert, the brother of the king ofEngland. They searched to rediscover the holy places, and finallyfound, after much trouble, four golden salvers stacked on top of oneanother in the ruins where the holy Temple had stood. In the middleof these salvers they saw the letter J. They immediately recognizedthe most holy name of the great master Builder of the World, felldown on their knees, praised him and thanked him for this greatdiscovery. As an eternal memorial to this important event theyfounded the great Royal Order of Scottish Masonry and calledthemselves Knights of the Temple of Jerusalem in memorial, becausethe builders of the second Temple at the time of Zorobabel had tocarry weapons in one hand and in the other their building tools,because their enemies were always trying to disrupt their work.Here we see the legendary roots not only of the Templars and theirsupposed Masonic connections, but also of the Scottish Rite.Traditionally Masonry traces its roots back to Hiram Abiff and to thebuilders of the Temple of Solomon. However, even Masonic historiansagree that the connections between that time and place and modernMasonry are tenuous. Hiram Abiff appears to be one of those figuressupplied from biblical accounts to explain and illustrate in legendaryfashion what was being enacted in the age-old gild rituals. Althoughmodern Masonry traces its lineage to the reforms undertaken in Englandin 1717, the figure of Hiram Abifff does not appear until a short time laterin the Old Charges of 1725-1730 (Mackey's Encyclopedia, Supplement p.1259))Academic HistoryBy way of example as to how traditional history and academic historycan be brought together under certain conditions, let us look at thevarious myths on the origin of the English people. One has it thatGermanic chieftains, Hengest and Horsa were invited by the British torestore order to the lawless world of post-Roman Britain. Another has itthat they are a \"lost tribe of Israel\"— the Isaac's-sons = Saxons (!).While yet another holds that they are descendants of a wandering Trojan.The three traditions are, however, not equal in value. The first has amplearcheological evidence to support is broad outline, if not its details. Theother two are born of medieval agendas and must be relegated to puremyth.19"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"In this section, as I take on the academic history of Freemasonry, Iwant to show how historical facts (independent of Masonic tradition) mustbe used to corroborate the story. In the end, however, I realize that manywill argue that the version of history I am presenting is just as fantastic assome of the others. I only ask the reader to consider the whole of history,and to realize, as always that the truest answers are usually found close tohome, and not in some exotic locale.To aid in keeping historical events in chronological order — a featwith which many \"new agers\" seem to have a profound problem — Ihave included a table of chronological events at the end of the book.When considering the rational history of Freemasonry, one must keepin mind that we may be dealing with two distinct, albeit related, streams:operative masonry and speculative masonry.In general operative Masonry can be defined as the craft of buildingstructures in free stone (shaped blocks of stone). However, in a broadersense the craft originally refers to the building of structures in general andgoes back to a time before the Germanic peoples were building in stone,to a time when only wooden structures were being erected. Even thenthere was a builders' gild. In Germany these were (and are) referred to asthe Zimmermdnner— the timber-workers or carpenters. Curiously, theuniform of these workers is that of a long black coat and a very wide-brimmed black hat. That a certain type of \"speculative masonry\" wasbeing practiced even in the most ancient times when structures were onlybeing built out of wood is revealed by certain Old Norse architecturalterminology. For example, the word ass, which means on the one handthe main ancient Germanic gods of consciousness, can also refer to \"themain beam running along a house,\" (Cleasby-Vigfusson, p. 46) Beyondthis, \"the short pillars which support the beams and rafters in a house\"are called dvergar, \"dwarves.\" (Cleasby-Vigfusson, p. 110) This indicatesclearly that pagan theological terminology was used metaphorically inconnection with the terminology for architecture. This is a clear indicationof the distant roots of speculative Masonry in the North.George Fort (p. 183) concluded that there were two distinct streamsof masonic tradition itself— one a practical one leading back through theGreeks to the orient, and a spiritual one which was at home in the\"Gothic\" north.In a sense it is most likely that speculative \"masonry\" (= constructivecrafts) always went along with practical or operative masonry in thatancient craftsmen probably had certain traditions which explained how theworked is constructed and how humanity fits into it which wasmetaphorically based on the techniques employed in their particular crafts.Builders saw the world as a great structure, cartwrights saw it as a wagon,etc. But in modern times this holistic view becomes less and less common.So, as with so much else, parts of the whole are separated out to fulfilltheir special functions. Thus practical and technical concerns are excisedfrom philosophical or spiritual outlooks.Operative MasonryOperative or practical masonry describes the gilds dedicated to theteaching and preservation of skills of building structures, first in woodthen in stone. In a pre-literate world these institutions are indispensable tothe continuation of cultural features from one generation to the next.These institutions began in pre-Christian times, but were entirelyrenovated under the influence of the Catholic Church in the Middle Ages.The Germanic peoples were slowly,a nd often violently, Christianized overa span of about eight hundred years.Most serious scholars would agree that in the historicalChristianization process the earlier prevailing cultural norms of paganismrequire centuries to be fully extinguished, if they ever can be. JamesRussell makes an extensive study of this phenomenon for the Germanicworld in his seminal work The Germanization of Early MedievalChristianity. The ideas contained in his book are, however, by no meansisolated. George Fort says:It is well known that early Christian missionaries endeavored, so faras practicable, to harmonize the religious observances of Christ andthe heathen Teutons. In numerous instances, old Norse customswhich alluded directly to Pagan mythology were altered only so far asto furnish a slightly variant objective point, and by this means muchthat originally represented the fast fading doctrines of the Northmaintained, under Christian garb, a vigorous vitality. It is fairlyinferred that the similarity which presents itself in Prey's ear of comand Shibboleth, a sheaf of wheat, can be assigned to this policypracticed by early Christian evangelists.(p. 290)Freemasons were originally organized as a gild under the Ostrogothicking Theodoric the Great (493-526) in northern Italy— his buildingprogram made use of Greek artisans who came to Italy under hispatronage. With the fall of the Ostrogoths in northern Italy, theLangobards took over this gild structure. The term freemason wasapparently first applied here, The element \"free\" in the nomenclaturealternatively refers to the fact that these craftsmen worked in free stone,i.e. cut stone which they worked into shapes suitable for their buildingpurposes, or it may refer to the fact that these craftsmen worked infreedom from royal regulation and restrictions in the time of Theodoric.The fact that masons were so important to the royal career ofTheodoric the Great, king of the Ostrogoths, is perhaps mysteriouslyencoded in the existence and characteristics of the tomb of that great king.It still stands today in the city of Ravenna, its mysteries still waiting to beunraveled.2021"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"Tomb of TheodoricIn 726 Leo the Isaurian prohibited imagery to be used in EasternOrthodox churches. This prohibition lasted 120 years. During this timeartisans streamed to the west in order to ply their trade. Many came toLangobardic Italy, where they melded with the builders' gilds originallyestablished under Theodoric. After Charlemagne, the king of the Franks,conquered the Langobards in 774, he undertook the renewal of his ownkingdom and empire and as a part of this effort he brought stone masonsfrom Italy to build structures for him in Germany. Many see this as asignificant root of masonry in the Germanic world.There is also a tradition that the Anglo-Saxon king Edwin ofNorthumbria introduced the craft of masonry in York in 926. This isderived from the fact that Bede reports that Edwin, for his baptism, hadhimself built a church of wood. Later this was reinforced out ofstone.(Bede 11:14) Alternatively, this role of being the original mason inEngland is ascribed to king Athelstan (924-939). But the location of thefirst English lodge is consistently placed in York. (Fort, p. 114) Ultimately,this identification with Masonry and the northern parts of England isprobably a reflection of the deep-seated role Scandinavian practices playedin the formation of some of the early forms of gilds in England. Thenorthern and eastern parts of England were under Scandinaviandomination from about 886 to 1066. This area was known as theDanelaw.22In the west, masonic gilds were brought under the control of theChurch in the early Middle Ages. This was to ensure their Christianloyalty and to see to it that they did not become hotbeds of \"paganresistance.\" Many monks became operative masons and the lodges wereoften situated in monasteries. However, around 1200, the governance ofthe lodges passed out of the hands of the Church. At this time manymonks remained affiliated with the masonic gild. Much of the stylizationof certain religious figures and ideas in the Church in masonic art can betraced to rivalries within the Church itself. These were rivalries whichwere reflected in the division between those churchmen who wereaffiliated with the masons and those who were not.Since time immemorial among the Indo-European peoplesinformation of a complex spiritual or practical kind has been passed fromone generation to the next using a specific system of education. This, likeso much else the Indo-Europeans created, was arranged in a tripartiteway. There were masters, i.e. those who had the special knowledge thatothers sought. They jealously guarded the secrets of the various crafts—from poetry, to warcraft, to the many handicrafts (e.g. metallurgy,structural building, or wagon-making). These masters, in order to pass theskills along, had to take on young apprentices, students of the craft inquestion. (Often these could be drawn only from his own family.) In anycase part of the economics of such groups is that the skill cannot be toowidely taught, otherwise it will be greatly reduced in value. Therefore theMaster accepts an apprentice, and he is put to work doing menial tasks,and slowly he is taught various individual skills necessary to the craft.After a certain amount of time has passed, enough skills have beenlearned and he has been tested as far as his character is concerned, theapprentice graduates to being a fellow. Our English word \"fellow\" isderived fro the Old Norse word felagi, \"a fellow.\" A fellow is one who isprovisionally accepted as a colleague. The fellow is sometimes also knownas a \"journeyman.\" This word can be taken literally to indicated that thefellow is supposed to journey about the land going from one master'sworkshop to the next picking up more skills and making himself knownmore widely in the gild. Once enough time has passed and enough skillshave been accumulated and assimilated the fellow will be able to craft anobject or perform a skill tantamount to that of a master. He thus creates amasterpiece, which is judged by a group of masters to be worthy of amaster and he is subsequently made a master of the gild and thus alsobecomes responsible to teach other apprentices according to the customsof the gild.Thus we have a basic three-degree system in all gilds:I. ApprenticeII. FellowHI. Master23"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"Among the warriors of the Middle Ages, the knights of chivalry, thesethree degrees were: I) page, II) squire and III) knight. This general systemremains in effect in European trade unions, and is to some extent stillreflected in some parts of American practice. In the academic world thissystem lies at the root of the three degrees of bachelor, master and doctor.In ancient times, when all free-men might find themselves fighting inbattles to defend their tribes, the old gilds often became \"militarized.\"German gilds of the 13th century, no matter what trade they embodied,were always armed and went to battle led by their masters. (Fort pp. 203-04)Because the early gilds guarded secrets of effectiveness, these had tobe preserved by men of good character and trustworthiness. This oftencame down to passing the traditions along only along family lines. (This isreflected in the importance modern Freemasons give to a member'sMasonic heritage within his family.) When recruiting outside family lines,gilds often required proof of intelligence and the ownership of property. Agild member had to be a free-man of legitimate birth, that is, no bastardslave or thrall could possibly be a member of such a gild. Such restrictionswere also placed upon who could attend the court in ancient times amongthe Germanic peoples.(Fort p. 271)The ancient Germanic gilds were invariably dedicated to a certain godor goddess. Some of the gilds were strictly religious affairs, created andmaintained for the purpose of performing the seasonal sacrifices and alsoto provide for the public welfare in times of need.It has already been implied that operative masonry — the institutionalcultivation of technical skills — contains the roots of speculative masonry,i.e. a system of philosophical reflections on life and the meaning of theworld based on the system of technical skills.So what were the building crafts as practiced in the North in ancienttimes? We know that they built often elaborate and magnificent structuresof wood. The Gothic historian Jordanes, quoting Priscus concerning thewooden structures built by the Goths among the men of Attila:At no great distance from that place we arrived at the village whereKing Attila was dwelling,—a village, I say, like a great city, in whichwe found wooden walls made of smooth-shining boards, whose jointsso counterfeited solidity that the union of the boards could scarcelybe distinguished by close scrutiny.(Getica XXXIV. 179)Wooden buildings and ships preserved from the end of the pagan periodand from the dawn of the Christianized times give testimony to thesophisticated skills the ancient northmen had when it came to working inwood. The stave churches, preserved for the most part in Norway,provide our greatest insight into the architectural wonders of the ancientNorth.24Once working in stone was introduced in the North by the Anglo-Saxons and the Franks stone structures began to be built for the first timenorth of the Alps since the Roman times. At first they imitated the Romanstyle— in the so-called Romanesque period. But after a while theydeveloped and spread their own style, which later took on the name\"Gothic.\" Just as the ancient Greek temples were really marbleizedversions of wooden structures, the Gothic style betrays a spirit born inwoodcarving.Gilds formed to educate craftsmen in the skills of masonry and to actas a sort of trade union for such workers flourished in the Middle ages.But with the dawn of the modern world in the sixteenth century the greatsecular power of these gilds began to wane.Speculative MasonryThe use of the rituals and structures of ancient gilds for philosophical(and even political) purposes is what is referred to as \"speculativeMasonry.\" The roots of speculative Masonry are essentially three: 1) theinherent and innate philosophical content of the gild rituals, 2)Rosicrucianism, and 3) various occult sciences prevalent in the late 1600s.This book is, of course, exclusively focused on the first of these roots. Thisis not to say that the other two were not of essential importance to theshape which Masonry took in the wake of the reforms of 1717.Rosicrucianism, besides supplying a good deal of mystical content, alsocontributed the idea of an international brotherhood of worthy men whowould recognize one another as brothers, regardless of nationality. It ismost likely that it is this idea which most motivated the organizers ofmodern Freemasonry. On St. John the Baptist's Day, June 24, 1717, fouror more old operative lodges of London and Westminster met in Londonand organized a Grand Lodge. One of the main reasons for theorganization was to form a brotherhood — eventually an internationalbrotherhood — of free men dedicated rational thought and spiritualdevelopment of its members and to independence from, and if necessary,opposition to the monarchy (tyranny) and the Church (superstition). Assuch modern Masonry is a child of the Enlightenment. It offeredindependent free men a mode of organizing in effective ways apart fromroyal and ecclesiastical authority. As such it became a vessel for theremanifestation of certain very ancient cultural traits which had pre-datedthe advent of Christianity and both its rationale for royal authority (divinegrace/right) and its own social organization, i.e. the Church.Modern Masonry is said to have three main tenets, or teachings:Brotherly Love, Relief and Truth. By \"Brotherly Love\" they mean thatthe relationship among Masons is akin to that of blood brothers—regardless of the nationality of the brother. By \"Relief they meant toindicate the principle of benevolence and charity. By \"Truth\" is meant,25"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"not only that which satisfies the mind — in the sense that the Freemasonseeks to develop his own character and knowledge of Masonry — butalso sincerity of conscience and truthfulness in act as well as in speech andthought.It is true that the reformers of the early eighteenth century could haveonly partially understood any older philosophical content contained in theancient gild rituals which they adapted to their own purposes. However,these underlying principles were nevertheless necessarily preserved in thevery shape and form of the rituals which they perpetuated. The framers ofmodern Masonry appear to have consciously sought to \"restore\" thecontent of the rituals to their supposed (yet in fact nonexistent) Solomonicorigins. To accomplish this they appear to have filled out the rituals withreferences to biblical lore in those places where they might have beenconstrued to have been suggested. But if we take a more conservative, orradically traditional, view we must come to the conclusion that thephilosophical content of the rite was more perfectly (if obscurely) housedin the elements of the old gild ceremonies, which can be more naturallytraced to the lore of the native inhabitants of England and Scandinavia.In ancient Germanic times there were gilds dedicated to the sacrificialservice of certain gods and goddesses. As the gods often patronized orsponsored certain crafts, e.g. smithing, wagon-making, building crafts, thecrafts themselves were also a part of the \"worship\" of the divinity. InChristian times certain Saints systematically replaced the gods andgoddesses, and thus became the \"patron saints\" of the crafts. These saintswere also thought to correspond to the various gods and goddesses and tohave taken their places in the lives of the people.Such gilds were especially strong in early Christian Scandinavia, andthis included the Scandinivized parts of Britain (i.e. Scotland and northernEngland). It is probably no coincidence that modern Masonry emergedfrom precisely these areas, which accounts for the importance of the Yorkand Scottish Rites. In this region pagan esoteric symbolism was re-encoded in Christian forms and terms. In this way underlying mythic andritual patterns of behavior inherited from Germanic paganism wereretained, but the meanings of these behaviors were necessarily forgottenover time.In modern times there began an impetus toward speculative orsymbolic Masonry. At the beginning those interested in the symbolicaspects of Masonry were entirely ignorant of its deep heritage and itsmysteries. They largely accepted the Christianized and Judaized storiesand myths woven into Masonic customs. This led them to mistakenly seethe mysteries as being \"illuminated\" by these biblical and pseudo-biblicalstories. It would not be until the 19th century and the work of men suchas the Brothers Grimm in Germany that the philological and comparativeskills would be developed which could more accurately unravel the originsof Masonic customs. However, it must be added that this revelationlargely fell on deaf ears, as the masses preferred to believe in the often26patently absurd stories rooted in Judeo-Christian imagery. This continuesto be so today.27"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"Reflections of Germanic Mythic Traditionin Masonic RitualMasonry is now widely held to be a Judeo-Christian phenomenon. Yetformally all that is required to be a member is that one profess a belief in a\"supreme being.\" However, Masonry, as practiced in modern times inlargely Christian countries possesses a ritual that has been heavilyChristianized over the years. But it is most likely that the ritual goes backto a much simpler pre-Christian archetype which has progressively beenmasked by conscious and unconscious efforts to make it appear to comefrom somewhere else.We are dealing with often undocumented pre-historic events and assuch we can never be entirely certain of the accuracy of our conclusionson such matters. Neither can we, in a study of this length, exhaustivelydiscuss all of the ramifications of the ideas in question. However, theoverwhelming preponderance of the evidence points to the legitimacy ofour interpretation— shared by most objective observers. It is also hopedthat this thread of research will be taken up by another intrepid researcherwho will being even more light to the subject.In what follows it is my contention that the major features of originalMasonic symbolism and ritual mechanics are ultimately derived fromGermanic practices and customs. The fact that this reality is not widelyknown or believed stems from the fact that the early modern Masonsintentionally concealed the basic format under a barrage of Judeo-Christian verbiage. Here we will see many of the features Germanicculture as they gave rise to early gild-based, and ultimately Masonic,symbolism and ritual.29"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"Origins of Masonic RitualThe complex modern Freemasonic ritual did not spring forth fromany one source fully developed and intact. Rather it is the result ofcenturies of accretion, modification and editorializing. Most of theelements of its rubrics or ritual actions spring from the gild rituals of pre-Christian and early medieval times. The esthetics and much of the ritualverbiage was created around 1700. At that time and subsequently, thespeculative Masons had very little knowledge abut the early Germanicroots of their ritual and all their sense of mystery was focused onsupposed Old Testament legends which mythically connected theirbrotherhood to the Temple of Solomon and even to the lore of theHebrews. Historically there appears to be little that connects Masonicritual to the religious rites of the Hebrews. As is the case with most thingsmysterious, the apparent truth is often exotic, but the actual truth is muchcloser to home.It appears most likely that Masonic ritual goes directly back to the gildrituals of the late Middle Ages, which were in turn derived from olderforms with their ultimate roots in pre-Christian ritualism of northwesternEurope. These rituals were no doubt originally heavily laden with allusionsto pagan religion and myth. But Christian missionaries in the north could,of course, not allow pagan \"religious\" observances to survive— templeswere destroyed, priesthoods eradicated, etc. However, the ancienttraditional Germanic peoples, like all traditional peoples, possessed aholistic culture. \"Religion\" was not separate from law, or war, orcommerce. Christians saw, and still see religion as a thing set apart fromthe rest of life. The traditional cultures did not, and do not. But due to thisfact of attitude, the Cllristians did allow the customs associated with whatthey thought to be \"non-religious\" customs to continue more or lessintact. They did this for practical reasons, for if they had not done so theywould not have succeeded as they did. For this reason, gild customs andrituals continued in this manner largely in their pagan forms, as did therituals surrounding the procedures of the courts of law. Of course, again,where the old gods might have played a role in these rites, they wereobligatorily excised in a crude fashion and simply replaced in the formulasby Christian figures. But the basic structures often remained largelyunaffected.A gild in the ancient sense is an oath-bound society with some specialpurpose under the patronage of a spiritual entity. The members contribute(donate) to it, work for and within its purposes, and in turn receivebenefits from it— this is the essence of the meaning of the word \"gild\": Itis a mutual yielding of various types of resources the individual to thegroup, the group to the god and the god back to the individual and group.This process was largely effected through certain ceremonial actions andformal interpersonal relationships.30We are uncertain as to the exact nature and complexity of the ancientgild rituals. That they existed in some from there can be no doubt. Neitherwould it be reasonably doubted that these rituals formed the basis of theearly Masonic rites. Some gilds were formed in pre-Christian times for theexpressed purpose of carrying out (pagan) religious rites. As with thegreat sacrificial rituals of the Germanic peoples, a festive meal wouldfollow the sacrifice. After all the religious sacrifice of the ancient Germanicpeoples resembled a \"sacred barbecue\" in which an animal, manifestingthe qualities of a god or goddess, was slaughtered in a manner whichideally caused the victim no fear or pain. The meat was then cooked andconsumed by the gathered worshippers, while certain parts of the animal,e.g. the head, forelegs, were ritually deposited in well-shafts, or burned.This attitude toward sacrifice had nothing to do with the Old TestamentJewish customs, which gave the whole animal \"to God.\" (To our ownancestors this would have seemed a superstitious waste.) Repeatedly wehear about how the gilds held banquets after their ceremonial work. Sucha banquet was also held after funerals held by the gilds for their members.These rituals often included specific drinking rites which made use of adrinking horn called Willkommen, \"welcome\" in German. Early pre-Christian gilds held these post-sacrificial feasts in honors of the gods andgoddesses, as well as their tribal and clanic heroes and ancestors. InChristian times Those so honored could only be God, and the saints of theChurch. But still departed family members could be honored as well.(Fort, p. 380)In Masonic custom, especially in Germany, there is the custom oftoasting departed members of the lodge. Since time immemorial in suchfeasts a garland of flowers, with a rose in the middle, was suspended overthe feast-table. This is a symbolic way of indicating that al that transpiresthere should be held in the strictest secrecy— sub rosa (i.e. \"under therose\").The act of ceremonially drinking an intoxicating brew was always apart of the original pagan religious feast. This was an element of ritualwhich was still observed in the early medieval gild-banquets. Fort (p. 214)describes how the actual ritual of drinking the draught was performed:Ancient usage required that this toasting should be performed in threecadences or motions. A glove or handkerchief covered the hand whichgrasped the bowl; the lid was then raised and finally carrie to the lipsand drank in three regularly tunes ttdraughts; after which it wasreplaced on the banqueting table with similar movements.In connection with what is reported here we cannot fail to notice thethree-fold symbolism of the drinking ritual and how it must haveoriginally been connected to the lore fot the three great vats of the sacredmead: Odrcerir, Son and Bodn. All of this symbolism is also probablyreflected in the symbol of three interlocked drinking horns found inViking Age sacred art.31"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"Fort (pp. 390-91) notes that in the overtly pagan nature of the gildstructure and essence was recognized by clerics in the Middle Ages. Theycontinued to meet once a month on the Calends, i.e. the first of the monthaccording to the newly introduced Roman calendar, and three times ayear larger festivals were held. In the medieval period the timing of thesewas alternatively Christmas, All Saints and St. John's Day (Midsummer),or Christmas, Easter and St. Johns Day. The original purpose of theselarger festivals in pagan times was originally religious, legal andcommercial. In the Christian Middle Ages the overtly pagan religiouscomponent was, of course, lost. However, the rites and customssurrounding the festivals in other areas remained largely the same.Pagan Court RitualsGeorge Fort clearly shows that many features of Masonic ritual arederived directly from the practices used in early Germanic courts of law.These courts were sacred affairs in the pre-Christian world, presided overby gods of justice and law. The principal Germanic god of justice is OldNorse Tyr, Old English Tiw. It is from his name that our name forTuesday is derived, and it is because his day was best suited for legalmatters and assembling courts, that early English town-meetings wereheld on his day. This is also the ultimate explanation for why theAmerican Founding Fathers cited Tuesday as the proper day for elections.It appears that these arrangements and customs had a significanteffect on the form of the Masonic lodge, but that these features were tosome extent also influenced by the more religiously oriented spaces usedin sacrifice, as well. It is perhaps also possible that these ritualized spacesand arrangements were already synthesized in pre-Christian gild-ritual andthat the synthesis of customs is not a later, post-Christianized one.Courts were called to order at sunrise, and could not go past sunset.Similarly Masonic lodges are symbolically said to open at sunrise andconclude at sunset, the time, it is often explained, when wages of theworkers would be received.Ancient Germanic courts were to be places free of violence and placesof peace (Grimm Deutsche Rechtsaltertiimer p. 745). Many ancient holyplaces had to be kept free of weapons and metal objects. This was sostrictly observed that when in the time of the Christianization, one accounttells of how a pagan temple was desecrated simply by having a spearthrown into it. (Bede, n, 13) This perhaps later became the ritualizedMasonic idea that to enter the lodge the Apprentice had to divest himselfof all metallic objects.At the beginning of the ancient Germanic court, the judge does thesame as the Master of the lodge does in Masonry \"by commandingattention and placing the sacred enclosure under the ban of harmony andpeace. In this respect the powers incident to a medieval court andcongregated Masons may be traced to a custom practiced by the early32Germans, whose priesthood, in such assemblies, enjoined quiet andsilence.\" (Fort, 270) Some of these traits of a Germanic legal assembly arealso reported as early as the first century by the Roman ethnographer andhistorian, Tacitus in his Germania (chapter 11).The arrangement of the court in ancient Germanic times has entirelyconditioned how courts are arranged to this day in American courtrooms,for example. In the ancient Germanic arrangement, the judge sat in thewest facing toward the east. An altar or other holy object would standbefore the judge. To his right, and facing north would be the accused ordefendant. To his left and facing south would be the plaintiff.(Grimm II,432) Other features of the ancient court led Fort to conclude that \"In itsdetails a Masonic lodge either directly or indirectly imitated the Norsetribunals.\"(Fort p. 293)The entrances into the court-space were more like those found inmodern Masonic lodges. Ingress into the sacred space was through one oftwo openings in the west, to the left and right of the judge.Arrangement of the Ancient Germanic Court-SpaceOn some matters relating to the origin of important elements inMasonic ritual and custom George Fort appears to be somewhatconfused. On page 406 of his study he says:Old Teutonic courts were a counterpart of such heathen symbolsand ceremonies as the priesthood manipulated in the celebration ofreligious services. When, therefore, the junction occurred which unitedGothic and Jewish elements in Freemasonry.by the merging ofByzantine art corporations into Germanic guilds in Italy, theNorsemen contributed the name and orientation, oaths, dedication ofthe lodge, opening and closing colloquies. Master's mallet andcolumns, and the lights and installation ceremonies.33"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"Fort goes on to say that It was from a Judaistic source that \"Masonryreceived the #omninfic word, or the faculty of Abrac and ritualism,including the Hiramic legend.\" That the Hiramic legend as reflected inactual Masonic ritual was in fact not of Judaic/biblical origin, but ratherwas in fact also rooted in Germanic lore is spoken to on the very nextpage when he writes: \"The traditions of he Northern deity, Baldur,seemingly furnished the substantial foundation for the introduction of thelegend of Hiram...\" As far as the origins of the \"#omnific word\" isconcerned, that too can be traced to Germanic lore, and will be addressedpresently.Themes in Masonic RitualBecause of the variegated origins of the whole of Masonic ritual, itmay prove to be impossible to reconstruct the archetype of Masonic ritualscientifically. But as a first step we can begin to identify certain themes orelements which have ancient origins and significances.George Fort provides us with a speculative version of a primitiveform of the stone-masons' gild initiation ritual (pp. 212-13) which isworthy of quoting in full here:Oftentimes a burlesque initiation was performed upon the applicant, inorder to render the genuine mysteries more solemn and impressive.The brethren divested themselves of their implements and short swordsin entering the mystic lodge (perhaps in a crypt), for the reason that thehighest symbolism of harmony and sanctity was to be impressed uponthe suppliant. The lodge being opened in suitable form , the Masterpresiding directed a brother Mason to prepare the candidate. Hisweapons, and all substances of like material were taken from him; aportion of his clothing was removed, so as to bare his breast,and withbandaged eyes and left foot unshod he sounded three distinct blowsupon the lodge door. Upon his entrance, a Warden received him andconducted him before the Master, who stood in the East. The candidateknelt and a short prayer was offered, after which he was led thricearound the room and back to the door, where, with his feet at a rightangle, he was ordered to advance by three upright, measured steps. Thecandidate was then placed in a position to take the prescribedobligation, which involved contact of his right hand with the sacredScriptures — holy-dome — and the square and compasses. He sworeto be true and loyal, and faithfully adhere o all the charges andregulations of a Mason, and to conceal with care and fidelity the secretsof the fraternity. The bandage was then removed and the three greatlights explained. Am apron was presented to him, and having receivedthe password, \"Wortzeichen,\" and grip , \"Handschenk,\" he took hisseat as a member of the lodge.Originally rites of Masonry were concluded with a banquet andcertain drinking rituals. Nowadays, at least in America, meals tend to betaken before the rites. These drinking rituals often involved a drinking-horn called Willkomen— \"welcome\" in German. Here we are remindedof the images of the ancient Norse valkyrja welcoming the fallen warriorinto Walhalla by offering him a drinking horn.Design of the LodgeClearly the shape of the lodge and its orientation is not historicallybased on the Temple of Solomon, but rather on pre-Christian Germaniccustoms surrounding the arrangement of sacred space. The Temple ofSolomon was \"oriented\" to the west, while the Masonic lodge is orientedin the opposite direction, in the same direction as most Germanic sacredspaces were in fact oriented.Fort (p. 263ff.) clearly shows that the Masonic lodge is based in parton pre-Christian Germanic courts, as we have seen. These environs werein turn based on Germanic religious arrangements. It cannot bediscounted that the Masonic lodge of northwestern Europe was alsoultimately influenced by the shape and arrangement of the Mithraeum.But that influence would have been only a distant memory by the time ofthe actual formations of gild-lodges.It may have been that the original shape of the sacred/court-space wasthat of a circle or oval— the Mdnnerring. This would have especially beenso when courts and such affairs were always held outdoors. Tacitusfamously comments that \"the Germans do not think it in keeping with thedivine majesty to confine gods within walls.\" (Germania chapter 9)Perhaps under the influence of buildings constructed ut of right angles,this space was squared off into an rectangle.Ancient Germanic sacred spaces were conventionally oriented to theeast— in order to face the rising sun at dawn. We know from historicalaccounts and the archeological record that the Temple of Solomon was\"oriented\" to the west. The earliest Christian church buildings were notoriented in any particular direction. It was only after substantial numbersof Germanic people had been Christianized that medieval Catholicchurches began to be obligatorily oriented to the east— with the altar inthe easternmost direction in the church. This tradition began in the fourthcentury. (This once strict requirement has in recent years been dispensedwith, perhaps due to its known pagan origins.)The general layout of an ancient Germanic hall or lodge had a fire inthe middle of the space, and to the south of the fire was the high-seat (araised platform) where the king, prince, or owner of the hall would sit.This, no doubt played some role in the arrangement of gild-lodges.The location of lodges is mythically and metaphorically referred to asbeing in hills or valleys. Part of the Masonic ritual reads: \"ancient brethrenformerly met on elevated places and in deep valleys.\" The idea thatmasons meet on high hills or down in valleys stems from the historic factthat Germanic pagan temples and places of holding court were conductedin such locations. During the Christianization process churches were infact often built on these locations. (Fort, p. 198)"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"Another possible connection with the pagan past lies in the fact thatwhen the great cathedrals were built, the first place the lodge of masonswould convene was the crypt— the underground space under the locationof the altar. In a practical sense this space provided the necessaryconcealment of their activities. However, as the archeological recordalmost always shows, these Christian churches were invariably built on thelocation, and often even upon the ruins, of a pre-Christian temple orsacred enclosure. The crypt was then in fact the precise location of thesacred space of the pre-Christian site.GWorshipful MasterAltar~1Senior WardenTylerPlan of a Typical Masonic Lodge RoomMasonic ritual refers to the dedication of the lodge to \"the holy Sts.John.\" originally Masonry was exclusively patronized by M. JohnBaptist. Only after the 16th century was St. John the Evangelist added.The Germanic symbolism underlying St. John the Baptist is twofold: 1.36particular iconography (the image he conspicuously manifests in art andlegend) and 2) the date of his feast day. St. John the Baptist is known forbeing beheaded, and his head then carried on a symbolic life after beingsevered. In Germanic lore the god Mimir, whose name means\"memory,\" is beheaded by the Vanir. Subsequently the god Odinpreserves the head of Mimir, and it becomes a source of esoteric wisdomfor him. The saint's feast-day is Midsummer— one of the three greatGermanic festival times, and a time when the victory of the sun overwinter is celebrated. St. John's Day — or Midsummer— remains one ofthe most important secular holidays in Scandinavia today. It remainsbeloved for reasons similar to those which made it so important in ancienttimes.The Three PillarsIn Freemasonry the lodge is said to rest on three pillars of columns:these are named as wisdom, strength and beauty. Fort (pp. 288-89) was ofthe opinion that these three pillars referred to the qualities of Odin, Thorand Frey respectively. He sites the description of the temple at Uppsalagiven by Adam of Bremen, as well as the later Icelandic account of atemple in the Eyrbyggja saga. Clearly Odin is a god of wisdom and Thorone of strength, while Freyr (as a Vanic deity) could be construed asexemplifying beauty, as did his twin sister, Freyja. These philosophicalideas go even further back, however. The qualities of wisdom, strengthand beauty could also refer to virtues of the three Indo-Europeanfunctions discussed by the French comparativist George Dumezil. Forthese are indeed the foundations of not only Indo-European myth andtheology, but of society as well.Other obvious and not-so-obvious examples of the tripartite ideologyin Masonic ritual include the Three Lights of Masonry. Fort (pp. 290-91)again connects these to the gods Odin, Thor and Frey. He identifies Freywith the sun, Odin with the moon and Thor with the stars. Frey is oftenassociated with light and shining radiance in northern myth, Odin is well-established as a lunar god, but the association between Thor and the starsis more obscure. It is said that the image of Thor is crowned with stars inthe temple of Uppsala. Also nails driven (with a hammer, of course) intothe beams and pillars of the temple structure were perhaps also seen assymbols of the stars. These are the so-called reginnaglar, \"nails of thegods,\" which are depicted in a temple of Thor (Eyrbyggja saga, ch. 4).The very idea of \"three lights\" being important to the symbolism ofsacred space is again an Indo-European concept. There were three firesignited in the sacrifice even in Vedic India.In Masonic ritual the central altar is approached with three particularsteps. Fort (pp. 306-07) speculates that the three steps, indicating youth,manhood and old age, correspond to the three gods Frey, Thor and Odinrespectively, which in turn correspond to the three pillars: beauty, strengthand wisdom.37"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"The Hammer or GavelThe hammer or mallet — usually referred to as a gavel — is animportant symbol in Masonry. It is also an extremely important one inancient Germanic myth, religion and custom. It appears to have beeninherited both from the symbolism of the hammer of Thor, called Mjbllnirby the Norse, and from the mallet used by judges in early Germaniccourts. When ancient Germanic judges opened their courts they did sowith three distinct hammer blows. (Again the tripartite ideology is mostprobably being expressed once more.In ancient Germanic religion and myth. The Germanic god Thor (OldNorse Thorr, Old English Thunor) wielded a hammer called Mjbllnir. Itwas the sacred weapon which kept the giants, forces of disorder andviolence, away from the holy enclosure of the gods. It is by the force ofthis sanctifying hammer that sacred space is governed and protected.In ancient Germanic legal customs the hammer played no less animportant role. A hammer was thrown by a man to determine the extentof the bounds of property he was claiming. A similar hammer-throw wasused to determine the size of ground to be used for a sacred enclosure.Auctioneers use a hammer to conclude sales, while judges use one to callthe court to order. The power of the hammer ultimately stems from thatof Mjollnir. Possession of a symbolic hammer indicates that the possessorhas the power and authority to govern the space consecrated by thathammer. George Fort concluded that the Mason's gavel was ultimatelyderived from the Hammer of Thor. He notes too that Hiram Abifff wassaid to have been killed with a blow from a hammer (a \"setting maul\").The very word \"mason\" has been conjectured to come from the word\"mace,\" a sort of war-hammer. However, it is more likely that it comesinto Middle English as machoun from Norman French machun, derivedfrom Old French masson, which ultimately stems from Germanic makon,\"to make.\"The Central AltarIn Christian churches as well as in the Hebrew temple, the altar orholy of holies was in one extreme end of the building designated as the\"temple.\" In Masonry this holiest of places is in the center of the lodge.Again this corresponds to the pagan ideal, not the Judeo-Christian one. Atthe center of the lodge is the Bible. Originally, according to Fort (1884, p.193), the Masonic book was in that place, which was referred to as theholy-dome (German Heiligtum). Upon this book the Masons swore theiroaths. The most important of these oaths related to the idea of preservingthe Masonic secrets. It is likely that the book replaced the oath-ring on thepre-Christian Germanic altar. It was upon just this ring that oaths wereoften solemnly sworn.Typically the central altar in a Masonic lodge is covered with a bluecloth. Fort (p. 295ff.) speculates that this blue color refers to the ancient38Germanic custom of having a \"blue\" stone as an altar stone upon whichoaths were sworn. The Indiculus Superstitionem et Paganorum (number7), refers to oaths being made super petras, \"over stones.\"The central altar and the Bible placed on it is the sacred object forFreemasons. It is called the \"great light\" of Masonry. One of its chiefritual functions is to act as an object upon which oaths are taken This altaralso served this function in ancient Germanic times, although the objectupon which the oath was taken was more often a weapon, hammer, ring,or in the case of craftsmen, their tools. The method of Germanic oath-taking mentioned by Fort (p. 315) includes the fact that the oath-takeralways faced east with one hand upraised and the other placed on a sacredobject. Obviously these liturgical features from ancient Germanic practicecontinued to be used not only in Masonry, but also in our modernAmerican secular courts.Various Themes in the Entered Apprentice RiteHere I will comment on various individual themes or elements foundin the Entered Apprentice Rite of Freemasonry. Many of these featuresform recurring motifs and elements throughout the ritual of Freemasonry,but are first encountered here.Hood and NooseNo one of English or American heritage can miss the obvioussymbolism of the noose and hoodwink that is placed on the person of theentering Apprentice during his induction ceremony. Although theseobjects and their arrangement are an obvious reference to execution byhanging, i.e. a symbolic death and a certain foreshadowing of the theme ofthe Master Mason Ritual, it is explained otherwise. Duncan's Ritual (p.48-49) indicates that the hoodwink symbolizes that the candidate was \"indarkness\" and that he \"should keep the whole world in darkness so far asit related to the secrets of Free-Masonry.\" The noose, referred to as a\"cable-tow\" is said to simply be an instrument to lead the candidate outof the lodge should he prove somehow unworthy. Execution by thepeculiar manner of hanging a person by the neck — especially from treesor specially constructed wooden gallows is a particular mode used by theGermanic peoples— especially when it came to making human sacrificesto the god Odin. In those days human sacrifices were drawn almostexclusively from the ranks of criminals and prisoners of war. The oldsymbolism referred to both the threat of death by hanging, and to the ideathat the candidate was being symbolically killed and reborn when thenoose and hood were removed, and the candidate beheld the symbols ofinitiation.Hand-GripsThe use of hand-grips as a form of greeting between people is anancient Indo-European custom. It is first recorded and seen among the39"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"Iranians. In Greco-Persian art we see, for example, the god Mithragreeting king Antiochus with a handshake in a relief from the fifthcentury BCE sacred complex called Nimrud Dag. This form of physicalcommunication was also well known in the symbolic behavior of theNorse. In Old Norse we have the word handaband, \"a joining or shakingo hands.\" This was used in greetings, and as signs of legal contract. Itshould be noted that Mithra was the god of such contracts in the Persianworld, and that he corresponds to the Germanic god Tyr.\"Hail\"The word \"hail\" (also spelled \"hale\") is used in the EnteredApprentice Obligation, wherein it says: \"I... promise and swear that I willalways hail, ever conceal and never reveal, and of the ... hidden mysteriesof Ancient Free Masonry ...\" (Duncan, p. 34) \"Hail\" is an ancientGermanic word meaning \"to conceal\" or \"to hide.\" In juridicalobligations in the German Middle Ages the formula appears [Ich] willbewahren, helen und halten: \"I will preserve, conceal and keep.\"Burial at the Sea-ShoreAnother obscure part of the Obligation formula is also illuminated byGermanic lore. It is stated that as one of the punishments for revealingMasonic secrets that the miscreant would have his \"body buried in therough sands of the sea at low water mark, where the tide ebbs and flowstwice in twenty-four hours...\" (Duncan, p. 34) Fort (p. 319) cites FrisianLaw, wherein it is stated that if someone broke into and robbed a pagantemple the crime would be punished by \"dragging the criminal to the sea-shore and burying the body at a point in the sands where the tide dailyebbed and flowed.\" Interestingly, Germanic myth indicates that humanitywas created by the gods at just this liminal place— the sea shore. (See thePoetic Edda, \"Voluspa\" stanza 17.)The Twenty-Four Inch GaugeIt is explained that this instrument for measuring length esotericallyrefers to the idea that as Masons should divide their time into threeportions: \"a portion the service of God and the relief of a distressedworthy brother, a portion for our usual avocations and a portion forrefreshment and sleep.\" That this idea of dividing one's time into threesegments is an ancient Indo-European one is corroborated by the fact thatit is mentioned in ancient Zoroastrian scripture where we read that it isone of the duties of a follower of Zarathustra:[T]o spend a third of my days and nights in attending the seminary andconsulting the wisdom of holy men, to spend a third of my days andnights tilling the soil and in making it fruitful, and to spend theremaining third of my days and nights in eating, rest, and enjoyment.40There are many more examples of thematic references to Germaniclore and custom to be found in Masonic rituals. But at this juncture let usmove on to two of the most important aspects of this study: the HiramicMaster Mason ritual and the idea of the \"lost word.\"Master Mason RitualThe central myth of modern Freemasonry is that of the death ofHiram Abiff, the loss of the \"master word\" and the three-foldresurrection of the master. The central rite of modern Freemasonry is adramatic enactment of this myth in which the candidate Master Masonritually assumes the role of the dead master, Hiram. We know that theHiram myth, as far as Masonry is concerned, is a modern innovation, withit first being mentioned in a ritual context after about 1725. But if we payattention to the mechanics of the Master mason ritual far more profoundconclusions can be reached. It is most likely that a ritual enactment of thedeath and resurrection of the Master Mason candidate is based on someolder myth, and that some variant of this myth and ritual was used byvarious gilds in northern Europe and that it is this which became themodel for the modern rite.The Masonic legend of Hiram Abiff may be summarized as follows:Hiram of Tyre (Lebanon) was the master builder of the Templeof Solomon. When the temple was just about to be finished,fifteen fellow crafts conspired to extort the secrets of the MasterMason from Hiram and travel to other countries to make moneyusing the secret. But twelve of these men recanted from thisplot. The other three men not yet qualified to be masters,continued to conspire to force Hiram to provide them with thesecrets of a Master Mason, including the Master Word, whichonly Hiram possessed. These men stationed themselves at thewestern, southern and eastern gates of the inner courts of thetemple. As Hiram tried to leave the temple by the southern gateat high noon after his day's work was done, he was accosted byone of the conspirators, Jubela, who three times demanded thesecrets, when Hiram refused, Jubela struck him with a twenty-four inch gauge across his throat. Hiram then attempted to fleethrough the western gate, and was similarly accosted by Jubelo.Again the demand ws made three times and three times refused.So Jubelo struck the master with a square cross his chest. ThenHiram made his way to the eastern gate and attempted toescape. But the third ruffian, Jubelum likewise demanded andwas refused the secrets, whereupon Hiram was struck a death-blow in his forehead with a setting maul. The murderers buried41"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"has been renewed— will the \"hit-man\" who killed him, Hodr. Inthe meantime, Baldur's funeral pyre was prepared by the gods,and before he was placed on it, his father, Odin, leaned downand whispered a secret in his ear.That this myth was not something created in the Middle Ages istestified to by the fact that the central events of Baldur's killing, orsomething functionally equivalent to it, is depicted on the Killerup B goldbracteate from around 500 CE— many hundreds of years before theMiddle Ages. Here we see the two conspirators and the wounded god,with the mistletoe projectile penetrating his body.George Fort goes as far as to suggest that Baldur and Hiram are\"identical.\" Fort goes on to describe how Hiram and Baldur can be seenas a \"sun gods\" and that the story of Hiram and the twelve companions(= the zodiacal signs) and the three ruffians (= the three winter monthswhich killed him) is reflective of this. (Fort p. 408) It is actually doubtful asto whether the myth of Baldur is such a reflection of such naturaloccurrences. But such interpretations were extremely common in the 19thcentury. Fort goes on to write:Baldur, the second son of Odin, occupies in the Northern mythology, aplace similar to Hiram the builder in Masonic tradition. Of so fan-aspect and so radiant, he is a synonym of light and beauty. On his lifedepended the active vitality of the gods of Asgard, as upon theexistence of the master architect rested the completion of Solomon'stemple— a type of the universe. Baldur was also named the great and44good. Hiram and Baldur were equally slain by treachery and fraud. Amallet was the instrument which killed the builder; the mistletoe causedthe Northern deity's death. In both catastrophes, sorrow andlamentation prevailed among their associated brethren. A search wasinstituted to find Baldur, the Norse god, similar to that made for therecovery of Hiram.(p. 408)If we look at the structures of the myths involved, we see that thereare many similarities. Both figures, Baldur and Hiram possess specialpowers of abilities which sustain themselves and the world around them.In both cases there is a secret or mystery at the center of the story— the\"lost word\" and the ultimate secret which Odin whispered into Baldur'sear. Both figures were murdered by a conspiracy. After the killing there isa ordeal undergone by members of their respective societies to recoversomething, and to try to bring the dead back to life. In both cases theattempts are apparently unsuccessful. However, in both cases also thestory becomes the basis for a ritual in which the human enactor of themyth actually is reborn and does receive some secret information which atleast points in the direction of the ultimate secret.One of the chief differences between the Baldur myth and ritual andthat of the Masonic ritual based on the legend of Hiram is that the formeris a warrior-initiation, while the latter is one for craftsmen. Most of the oldpagan lore and ritual was lost, of course. In the case of the Baldur mythwe probably only have a fragment of something which was very similarto the kind of ritual and myth used by ancient craftsmen in their gild-initiations.Evidence clearly shows that the verbiage used in the ritual ofFreemasonry is relatively more innovative, while the ritual actions arerelatively more conservative. The actions of symbolically killing andresurrecting the initiate is extremely archaic, while the legendaryexplanation about Hiram Abiff, for example, was instituted in moderntimes, in the early 1700s.The Lost WordThe idea of a hidden word, which is \"lost,\" and after which one mustseek, is also something of mythic importance in Germanic lore. In fact themyth of the lost and unfathomable word is directly connected to themysteries of the Death of Baldur. One particular Old Norse poem, the\"VafbruSnismal\" provides a clue. This poem consists of a riddleexchange between an age-old giant, Vafbru5nir, and a mysteriousstranger called Gagnra5r. The giant, because he has lived so long is verydeep in the lore of the world and can answer all the riddles put to him.But so too can Gagnra5r. Finally Gagnra5r puts an end to the contest byasking Vafbru5nir to answer a question that only he knows the answer to:45"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"FjolS ekfor, fjoldekfreistadak,fjold ek reynda regin:hvat mcflti OSinn, ddr a bdl stigi,sjdlfr i eyra syni?Much I traveled, much have I myself put to the test,much have I tested the gods:What did Odin himself whisper, into the ear of his son,before he [= Baldur] was placed on the pyre?Vafbnibnismal 54At that point the giant realizes he has been exchanging riddles withOdin, the god of wisdom himself and must acknowledge that Odin is thewiser. The point here is that what Odin whispered in Baldur's ear is thegreat secret.The German philologist Franz Rolf Schroder concluded that the wordwhich Odin spoke in Baldur's ear was run(a), \"secret; mystery.\" Thisword has much to recommend as the solution to this age-old riddle. First,its etymology relates it to the idea of \"whispering,\" as in the manner ofspeech by which secrets are passed. Second, the word would seem to bethe very word first received by Odin in his own great initiation on the treeof Yggdrasill, after which he conveyed the runes to the world. Third, theword means \"mystery,\" and therefore is, and remains, an eternal secretwhich causes those who hear it to strive for light and revelationeternally— which is the very function of the \"lost word.\" This word isthe gift given to his son by Odin who abides in the realm of the Dead —Hel — until the moment of his rebirth in the transformed world of thefuture.46Origin and Symbolism of FreemasonrybyGuido von ListOriginally published in Der Scherer (Vienna) vol. 12, nrs. 17-20 (1910)If one ignores the obscure, fabulous and legendary history ofFreemasonry and merely sticks to the confirmed fact that in the year1717 the four lodges then existing in London were unified into a singleGrand Lodge, which became the Mother Lodge of present-dayFreemasonry, and if one considers that these four lodges emerged fromoperative masonry, then one will have found the cardinal point uponwhich the question of the actual origin of Freemasonry can beinvestigated with any certainty. Furthermore, if one considers that themain signs of recognition used by the Freemasons, namely the signs,words and grips (hand-clasps) are not the exclusive property of lodge-brothers, but rather are also known to many gilds, corporations andcompanies, but most especially and most completely, to the stonemasons,bricklayers and carpenters, who still employ them today. This importantcircumstance gives considerable indication that the form of Freemasonrystemming from England must only be the renewed appearance of aninstitution which had previously been known in Germany as well, and thisis all the more true because both forms exist to this day in a parallelfashion without mutually influencing one another. This despite the factthat they both possess the same signs of recognition, the same symbols,and in essence similar ceremonial format. If one further considers that thedivision of Freemasonry into the three degrees of apprentice, fellow andmaster corresponds to that of practical masonry, and that even the\"parlier,\" (parliamentarian, speaker) made the transition intoFreemasonry, and that the most important symbols of Freemasonry are tobe found in Romanesque and Gothic cathedrals and secular structures ofthe earliest period, then the connection with the ancient Germanconstructions — to which reference has often been made — as a matterof compelling necessity cannot be summarily rejected. Many individualshave become known to the author of his present work, who — havingbelonged to a Freemasonic lodge — knew and demonstrated precisely the47"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"signs, words and grips by which they were \"taken and accepted inaccordance with guild statutes\" and upon this occasion acquired theknowledge of these ancient means of recognition, which thoroughlycorresponded to those of Freemasonry. The best known and most famousof these individuals was no less than the chief cathedral architect, BaronFriedrich von Schmidt, who died in Vienna on the 23rd of January 1891.Fig. 1Since we have identified these signs of recognition, e.g. the so-calledthroat-sign on the western portal of St. Stephen's Cathedral in Viennafrom 1144 (Fig. 1), from the earliest medieval period, where it is carvedinto stone and comes at the head of a series of mysterious images anddeclares in graphic form: \"I would rather have my throat cut than betraythe secret!\", the question automatically arises as to what the nature of thissecret was, that it has to be so carefully guarded and loyally preserved.Freemasonry likewise refers to its own \"Great Secret,\" which, if theyever possessed it, they have long since lost. This is why it has become asaying that \"the secret of Freemasonry is that it possesses no secret.\"That which Freemasonry guards as a secret, its philosophy, its symbolism,its ritual and its signs of recognition, have been known now for a longtime and they are taught and practiced in a much more comprehensiveand thorough way in other contexts than in the closed circle of thebrotherhood. Moreover, those things which are still regarded as secret arethe so-called lodge workings and their other corporate activities— thingswhich every other body also holds secret for obvious reasons. So for along time these have not deserved the designation as the \"Great Secret.\"— And yet! — The Great Secret existed and still exists today. It isconcealed in the symbolism of Freemasonry in a \"kalic\"1) manner, it ishidden behind riddles and awaits its decoding. To a high degree theFreemasons have earned our thanks because they so well guarded48unaltered symbols, rituals and legends which they themselves only halfunderstood, and preserved them unchanged through two whole centuries,as they had received them from the operative masons, who had in turntaken up the legacy from the ancient Germanic carpenters. Thesecarpenters supposedly perished in the turmoil attendant to theReformation Age.This \"Great Secret\" which receives so much emphasis goes backfrom Freemasonry through operative masonry to the builders' lodges(Strassbourg, Vienna, Cologne, Bern and later Regensburg). The ancientmasters had actually concealed this secret in hieroglyphics and secretsigns, and this was a secret that was only passed on orally to masters afteran exacting test of their characters. This was because it was strictlyforbidden to write this secret down or record it in any document. Nowunderstandably further questions arise as to what \"Great Secret\" thebuilders' lodge maintained, where its origin is to be found, and finally, themain question, whether this secret can be discovered or understood, ornot. It may be said from the beginning that these three questions can besatisfactorily answered.It is accepted as a matter of certainty that the medieval architecturalarts were in the hands of clerics, actually the Benedictine monks, and theirlay brothers until the 13th century, and only after that were these skillssupposed to be practiced by secular masters, who organized themselves inthe manner of a gild and were distinguished according to lodges to whichthey belonged. These were erected near the sites of great buildingprojects, and thus they called their gild-union a Bauhutte— a builder'shut, or lodge. From this it has been erroneously assumed that previously,before there were Benedictines or other clerical architects in Germany,that no stone buildings, or those who knew how to build them, could beshown to have existed in the Germanic countries. However, this is not so.As early as the Vita santi Severini by abbot Eugippius (from after 488)several churches in northern Noricum and Upper Pannonia on theDanube from Asturis (Klosterneuberg) to Batavis (Passau) and Juvavio(Salzburg) are mentioned, of which only one is mentioned which wasconstructed out of wood, while regarding the one only casually mentionedby Cucullis (Kuchel near Salzburg) it is only said that used candles wereaffixed to the walls of the church. Thus it may be concluded that all thechurch buildings, with the one exception of Quintanis (Osterhofen), werestone buildings. Additionally, the letter of Pope Gregory I (590-604) toMelittus of Canterbury explicitly speaks of \"idolatrous or heathenchurches\" as being substantial structures, and there are many other artfulstone buildings in Austria and Germany, even north of the Danube whichwere built in pre-Christian times— long before there were any clericalarchitects. This is proof enough that architecture belonged to the Germansand was not a Roman introduction for which we have to thank theChristian evangelists. Moreover, secular buildings, and therefore seculararchitects, were obviously necessary.49"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"The merger of clerics, mostly Benedictines, with lay brothersdedicated to the purpose of practicing architecture for the building ofchurches and monasteries had another cause, however. This was one thatwas itself the effect of something else, and not the original cause itself. Butthis cause reaches far back into the dawn of time, into those gray, mistytimes when after the fall of Imperial Rome, Pontifical Rome was strivingto obtain the legacy of the Empire. In doing this Rome sent its firstambassadors deep into the interior of Germany in order to obtainfollowers for Christianity. The Germanic priesthood, the Armanen (Skaldswere a subordinate group of Armanen) willingly received the apostles andformed mixed colleges with them which introduced the amalgamation ofWuotanism and Christianity as a result of concessions being offered onboth sides.This resulted in the Kalends, that is, those who brought about the\"change\" by means of kala, i.e. a twisting or turning (of meanings). Soon,however, they saw themselves as having been tricked and suppressed, butthey could no longer free themselves from their bonds. In the Calends, orcalendar-brotherhoods, the bishop was always in a leading position, theclerics of the diocese were the leading members, while the laity of theparish had been silenced.*) — At that point the followers of Wuotanism,making use of the two-sided meaning of the word Kaland (kal = conceal,turn, twist; and = the other, to alter, etc.), gathered together in a secretleague within the context of the Kalends2) and likewise with a hiddenmeaning called themselves the Kalander, as they attached the concept of\"the hidden others\" to these names in a secret [verkalten] sense, namelyone that indicated \"the Wuotanists hiding among apparent Christians.\"Germanic religion — Armanism as its esoteric aspect and Wuotanism asthe exoteric side — was therefore absorbed by those more restrictedcircles with the Kalendar**) into the High Secret Tribunal [HoheHeimliche Acht], i.e. something preserved in the strictest secrecy. Thissecret was indeed a \"Great Secret,\" the care-taking of which was boundup with extreme danger— especially in the late Middle Ages — thereforeit need only be remembered at this juncture that this secret was the verysuppressed religion of Armanism which was preserved in hieroglyphs thatpossessed double-meanings. In public these were seen as Christiansymbols, but they revealed Armanic and Wuotanistic knowledge in ahidden way to those who knew how to understand them. But since all artsand sciences of the Germanic folk had their roots in, as well as theirhighest guidance from, the Armanenschaft [Armanen-institution], the firstgermination of the of the builders' gild rose up in the Armanenschaft itselfand the first group of builders were themselves Armanic establishments.According to the nature of the Armanen, they moved out throughout thecountry in small groups led by a master, and temporarily sojourned wherethere was a building that needed to be built. It is from these wanderingconstruction workers that all the magnificent churches, monasteries,fortresses, and other substantial buildings that we still admire today owe50their origins. They were able to unfold the most meaningful artisticconstructions in often desolate places with small populations, which is atestament to the fact that such works were the result of migratoryartisans, since usually for a sedentary art only the biggest cities offered asuitable place. For this reason too the most important builders' gildsoriginated in Strassburg, Vienna, Cologne, Bern and later Regensburg andseveral other cities, while migratory masters of these gilds, along withtheir journeymen and apprentices, can be shown to have been activethroughout the Middle Ages. — It is obvious that it was these verymigratory construction workers who occasionally attached themselves fora time to the monks in the monasteries, and thus were often seen asbelonging to the monasteries, since, according to the customs of the timehaving to do with provisions and payment, they would have beenregarded as members of the monastic household and treated as suchduring the time they were engaged in their building activity.Now since the masters provided for and propagated Armanism,which they had taken into the High Holy Tribunal as their Great Secretin a secretly haled [= concealed] manner, i.e. their fellows and apprenticeswere only gradually initiated into these secrets, it was, of course,understandable that they expressed their teachings, which concealed[verkalte] or \"haled\" this secret in certain symbols which wereinterpreted on three levels, i.e. that they were arranged in three degrees ofknowledge in such a way that the apprentice only received the signs ofrecognition, the fellow received the \"Lesser Light\" and only the masterreceived the \"Greater Light.\" The apprentice received superficialinstructions stated in obscure words; the symbols and words wereexplained to the fellow in the Christian sense as the \"Lesser Light,\" butonly to the master was the \"Greater Light\" given, and only after he hadbeen tested as being loyal and reliable as an apprentice and fellow did hefind out the complete truth about the Greater Light, namely the solutionto the concealed riddle, the esoteric doctrine of knowledge in the contextof Armanism, along with the responsibility of developing it further."},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"IThe pentagram, or Femstern [five-star], was for ages the symbol ofthe human-being (the microcosm) as the unification of the five elements:fire, water, air, earth and the aether, which is the same five things beingreferred to which are concealed [verkalt] by the five vowelsAEIOU****). At first the apprentice should find these five elementswithin himself and learn to channel these, i.e. strive to achieve self-masterybefore he becomes a fellow. The four gross-material elements form,according to Armanism, the mortal body, the fifth rarified element —Aether — forms the immortal soul, which breaks down in turn into thetripartite spirit, spiritual soul and the human soul. As long as the soulremains unrecognized it stands outside the person as it were — just as inthe apprentices apron the triangle is outside the square — and only whenit becomes aware of itself does its mastery over the body begin and thetriangle asserts itself in a dominating fashion within the square. (Fig. 3 and4)Only upon this realization is the ego (soul, individuality) liberated, inthat it subordinates its outer appearances (body, personality) in aconscious and complete way, and thereby completely rules over its body,which is nothing but its mask, and is no longer ruled by the body as it wasbefore. Since this ego [Ichheit] is a spark of the divine, a ray of light sentout from the original light (divinity) itself at the beginning of creation(\"Let there be light...\") — a ray of light that is never extinguished (dies),which at the end of creation returns to the divinity (original light) fromwhich it was projected — every ego (soul) is therefore eternal, withoutbeginning and without end, unborn and immortal, whereas its appearance,its physical personality (mask), is natural and mortal. Every human soul(ego) — as Armanism further deduces — therefore has animatednumerous personalities (bodies) since the beginning of time in a long chainof existences and will continue to animate continually renewedpersonalities connecting each link of the chain one to the other on into thefurthest future, from which it can be concluded that each soul, unifiedwith its body — that is, every living person in and of himself — was hisown ancestor multiple times over and will also be his own descendentmultiple times, until time and space cease to exist. This uninterruptedmigration of the human soul, or individuality, from body to body — like athread upon which pearls are strung — is, however, not to be confusedwith the so-called transmigration of souls, but rather it is to be evaluatedfrom a much higher perspective. For each individuality shapes its owndestiny [Schicksal] with respect to future incarnations by means of itsown desires, actions or non-actions in the good as well as evil sense. Inthese incarnations the individual perceives this self-created destiny ashappiness or unhappiness, for: \"as you sow so shall you reap.\" Theperceptions of happiness or unhappiness in one's present life in a humanbody are the equivalent of those joys of heaven and the torments of hellwhich those religions that do not teach reincarnation necessarily projectoff into the beyond and imagine as lasting for eternity. Now every54individual who has penetrated through to such an understanding of hisown innermost being must also thereby have gained the conviction thathe has to migrate in ever renewed personalities throughout all ages on thisearth, and that he, as an integral part of divinity, sought and found thisdivinity, not outside of himself — but rather within himself — in theparticular spirit of the divine soul.This migration of the self within the chain of various personalitiesthrough all past and future ages was symbolized by the mysticalcircumambulations around the square — which the Masons call a tapis —symbolic journeys which the apprentice carries out four times upon hisacceptance and reception, the fellow does this five times at his promotionand the master does it seven times upon his elevation.Fig. 5Fig. 6On this square, also called the tabula quadrata (Fig. 5), are situatedthe \"three Great Lights,\" which in the Apprentices' Lodge are on theoutside (Fig. 5), in the Fellows' and Masters' Lodges on the inside, of thesquare (Fig. 6) at the three corners (east, south and west), while the fourth55"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"corner (north), illuminated by no light, lies in darkness. That which wassaid in connection with the symbolism of the apron with regard to theThree, being either on the inside or outside of the four, is also relevanthere. But the connection with the four quarters of heaven, of which threeappear illuminated while one remains unilluminated, is a reference to anancient sun-cult which is also called to mind by the designation of the\"three Great Lights\" as the almighty architect of all worlds (God), the sunand the moon.*****) And here also the kala once more comes into playas the square [Viereck] encodes the Fyroge (fire- or god's-eye, divineomniscience and human conscience) and \"fouring\" [Fiihrung =leadership]. The Fyroge therefore provides \"fouring\" (leadership)throughout life. Divine consciousness, innate divinity, guides eachindividual through the gate of birth in the east, into life in a human body,the zenith of which is achieved in the south, in order then to then passthrough the portal of death in the west, providing guidance to theindividual as it enters the dark realm of death in the north, in order to passthough this place and approach the portal of rebirth in the east. Therefore,Freemasonry today still mystically refers to death as \"entering into theeternal east.\" This is to be understood as meaning that the disembodiedindividuality of the deceased is on its way to its coming incarnations whichoccur in the eternal east within the Great Portal of Birth, out of which thesun also emerges every day. Therefore the master has to die symbolicallyat the conclusion of the seventh circumambulation and is placed in a coffinin order to be once more lifted up out of it as a symbolically rebornindividual. Only as such a person was he then told that he has to seek the\"lost master-word\" (Armanism) and the \"lost unpronounceable name ofGod\" (complete knowledge of the essence of divinity), which he can onlyfind beyond exoteric religious dogmas in esoteric realizations from withinhis own individuality. Then he is also told that this knowledge, which canonly be found on his own intuitively, is not to be given directly to others,because it is not transmittable through words and has to be sought andfound by each individual on his own, and therefore it is also called \"theunpronounceable name of the divinity.\"All the other ancient symbols of Freemasonry repeatedly validateknowledge concerning the foundation and intensification of this mainbody of knowledge albeit in fragmentary ways. Such symbols can beeasily interpreted once one has thoroughly absorbed this main body ofknowledge. In this regard architectural symbolism offers a nearlyinexhaustible treasury of such hieroglyphic images, from simple linefigures to the most richly stylized ornamentation. Here we should refer tothe meritorious work of the architect, Professor B. Hanftmann, HessischeHolzbauten (Marburg, N. G. Elvert, 1907, 4°) with its many veryinteresting illustrations. The symbolism of these buildings, entirely in thesense we have outlined in this study, can be seen to go back far into pre-Christian Armanic times.56For our purposes it is sufficient for the most part to clarify themanner in which the concealment [Verkalung] took place and that whichis essential concerning the Great Secret which the ancient Armanicmasters took into the High Holy Tribunal, for to go into the details here isnot possible due to considerations of space. Despite the fact that themembers' lives were in constant danger, those ancient lodges and theirinitiated masters preserved and nurtured this Great Secret which thedogmas of the Church so harshly opposed with its unlimited power ofcontrol it has in those days. For this reason, and due to the Inquisitionaltribunals, such as the witch-trials represented, with their constables whowere constantly trying to entrap people, they preserved the Secretthroughout manifold persecutions all the way to the end of the MiddleAges. But at the time of the religious upheavals and during the terrors ofthe Thirty Years War the lodges themselves, along with the Gothic style ofarchitecture, atrophied, and all the initiated masters slowly died out.Esotericism was lost and only its shell, exotericism, was carried forwardby half-initiated individuals in misunderstood and mangled forms. But thegreater part of the ancient hieroglyphic artworks were preserved down tothis day, as were the lodge-rituals and the symbolism of Freemasonry, andbecause the key itself has finally been found with which to decode thesesymbols, the Great Secret that Freemasonry so loyally preserved in itsclosed treasure-house, is now no longer a book of seven seals.In the eighteenth century, when occult sciences were finding renewedlevels of cultivation, such occult ideas penetrated into the lodges of theFreemasons, and since there were many points of concord, the ritual andsymbolism of the lodges were influenced in many ways. It was thoughtthat the solution to the riddle and the Great Secret might be found inthese occult sciences, which proved to be an erroneous notion, for only inartfully concealed [verkalte] Armanism is the key to this solution hidden.57"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"1*) Sachsenspiegel Book I, Article 2: EIn ieglicher Christen Mann istpflichtig den \"Senat\" (synod, clerical court) zu besuchen dreymal im Jahr. . . in dem Bistumb da er gesessen ist. . .

This can come aninner action or outward action. Different individuals will be called to actdifferently depending on who they are and what their destinies are.However, I would like to put out the call to action on many reader'sparts— a call to reclaim the ancient heritage contained in the outer shell ofmodern Freemasonry, and to return modern Masonry to its own roots asan offspring of the Enlightenment.It must also be said that this brief study does not do the subject matterperfect justice. The whole field seems to require a new study on the levelthat George Fort attempted well over a hundred years ago. His study issizable, but there is much that has since come to light that would haveeven further illuminated his discussion.At present Freemasonry is dying out in America. The averagemember is in his late seventies— right at the edge of the average life-expectancy. Additionally, the generation which they represent, is a highlyconformist generation. Whereas the spirit of modern Masonry was arevolutionary, non-conformist one. Whereas the Masons of old wereseeking forms of intellectual stimulation — a search for Truth — and abond of brotherhood which transcended nationality or Church affiliation,the current average Mason is patriotic (in the sense of the \"GreatGeneration\") and religiously orthodox. In other words, what started andnourished as a \"think tank\" for cultural innovation housed in an archaicform of radical traditionalism has become a placid pond for culturalconservatism.There are increasing numbers of esotericists being drawn to Masonrytoday. This is a good trend. But it must continue and accelerate. (I tried todo my part but failed. I urge those readers who can to make the effort aswell.) The Brotherhood is ripe for a major paradigm shift. The oldgeneration is dying out, the younger generation (at present very small innumber) is probably dominated by an even more conservative, intolerantmindset than the one it is replacing. But the number of these men is small.Esotericists can make the difference if they willfully act to shift theparadigm of Masonry back to its roots.59"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"1Here I am not calling on individuals to turn Freemasonry into aradical traditional schools of Germanic esotericism by returning it to thebasic root of the primitive origins of the Masonic rite, which was thesubject of the foregoing study. But rather simply to return it to some kindof spirit of esotericism where the system can be used for aims for which itwas originally intended. I call on non-Masons to seriously considerapproaching the Brotherhood. (The amount of memorization one has todo is about like that of having to take the leading role in a Shakespeareanplay.) Those readers who are already Masons should take heed of thecontents of this book. Masonry will die out completely if it is not madewhole. It can only be made whole by returning to its roots, back to itssources, spiritually and intellectually. In a traditional sense it can be theagent for the renewal of the republic and a powerful force for good in ourculture. But this is not likely to come about by mimicking what others —church and state — are already doing, and doing badly. The basic valuesand ideology of modern Enlightenment-based Masonry are the corevalues of this republic, which have been largely lost. The original spirit ofthe ancient root of the gilds upon which Masonry was built is the veryblueprint of our culture, which has been almost entirely forgotten.Masonry can be the vehicle for the recovery of what has been lost, andfor the remembrance of what has been forgotten.
