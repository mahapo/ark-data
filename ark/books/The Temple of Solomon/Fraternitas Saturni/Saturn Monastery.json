[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"The Saturn Monastery compiled from notes by Dr. Adolf Hemberger and Ricardo The Fraternitas Saturni had plans for the construction of a spiritual centre which would serve the theosophical-mystical, magical-theurgical and the theoretical and as well as the practical kabalistic studies and exercises of the brothers of the lodge. The Brothers were to live together like monks in a monastery state. Land was donated near Brix, Austria on the Obersal-mountain (near Berchtesgaden. Negotiations were done at one time. The designs which were found in the archive of the lodge were developed by occultists and Rosicrucians especially by G.W. Surya and the hermeticist and Neo-Buddhist Perryt Shou together with Rosicrucians, Pansophists and members of the Frateritas Saturni and others. It was to be modeled after the monk monasteries. Like those monks the brothers of this Saturn monastery should not have any money available to them while in the monastery. To remind the brothers of the monastic life they would wear a special order-ornate. A charter was to be obtained by the government comparable to the Anti-Christ colony in Southern France near Toulouse). However this plan to have that monastery in Austria did not work out because it was planned before the second world. Hitler annexed Austria in the Second World War and the idea had to be put on the back burner. After the war the idea was revived and it was planned to purchase land in Southern Germany and start all over again. However up to now it was not possible to raise enough money to make this a reality. The Ordo Saturni is still perusing this project. Who knows what the future will bring. According to the Saturn principle a monastery made of rocks and blasted into an escarpment, was envisioned. It was to be facing south so that the monetary who would be located ca 600 m about"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"sea-level, far from all the activities of the world could be outfitted with solar-panels, hydro-power station and land for agriculture and as a legally established corporation could attain autonomy. In the middle of the monastery they planned a quadrangular tower, on the top of the tower there would be attached two side wings so that the structure would look a gigantic Tau on the four corners they were to chisel a Saturn symbol. According to the blue-prints there were to be built several wings with a total of 60 rooms, indoor plumbing in every room. There was also to be built a swimming-pool and a guest house. It was the idea that no women who were less than 50 years old were to be allowed to live in the monastery. Children would not be allowed. In the basement of the monastery there would be located workshops, laboratories, a pharmacy, a sick-ward, a doctorâ€™s clinic, a working room, and outpatient clinic. The Lodge colors black and green were to be the dominating colors. The main room was to be constructed in the form of a nonagon in the middle of which would be black stone into which would be fitted in the middle of the top a crystal or an Onyx stone. Across from this black stone would be an altar with nine steps leading to it. On the third step the lectern would be placed. On top of the altar are placed the symbols of Saturn, the sign of Malkuth, the Menorah or the seven armed candelabra the candelabra with three arms (symbol of Saturn). Behind the altar was to be a portal as entranceway for the priests. The lighting was to be indirect by a ceiling light. All the rooms in the inside would be without windows because they would be located within a rock. Behind the altar and the portal was to be a small rectangular rook room to be used for ritual and internal Lodge meetings. Behind this room there was another room (also in the form of a rectangle) designate to be used for magical experiments. They planned to walls to be made of mirror-glass; the floors would be covered by slate and decorated with large circles for the main sigils of the seven planets. "},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"In front of the altar in the large hall a staircase (not visible) would lead into three lower vaults which were to be located exactly below the three upper rooms. Below the upper Lodge room there would be the vault in which on the sides along the wall the deceased brothers (either sitting or standing) who have attained a certain grade in the brotherhood would rest. At a small altar in the vault would be celebrated the mass for neophyte initiations or the raising into higher degrees. But most of this entire vault should be dedicated for meditation where the Brother would be left alone with the ancestors and powers of the Lodge. Air-shafts were to be built through the rocks to bring air into vaults. All the rooms were to be absolutely soundproof. The outer organization was to be structured so that there would be total financial independence for all the Brothers during their life time. By intense farming for example growing of fruits and grains, leasing out the lands which surround the monastery and distribution of natural medicines were all to help to ensure the financial independence. As well therapies would be offered in form of hypnosis, suggestions, color-therapy and psychoanalysis would be offered. Inspiring examples for this kind of monastery would be the Bon_Monasteries of Tibet. A bookbindery would also be operated. There would also be printing presses to print Lodge intern manuscripts, and also to produce special editions for collectors of good books. A special fund would be created to be administered by a trusty Brother to the invalids, to pay the salaries for the employees of the monastery and to increase the income for the Lodge by smart speculation. The Brothers would not have any money because everything is looked after including the monastery ornate. The Brothers would only receive money for traveling, missions and vacations. The abbot of the monastery would decide how the Brothers would lead their inner and outer life. Delegations to other esoteric organizations would be dispatched. Lectures would be held and also delegates would be sent abroad to advertise the monastery. There would also be educational evenings and courses would be held. There would also be an internal monastery school the spread the knowledge about the Saturnian ideas. Each Brother would have the"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"right in his old age to live in the monastery. For this according to an old order manuscript the Great Demiurge Saturnus may help them. The abbot of the monastery should have the rank of a Grand Master of the Lodge (33`). A council of elder to help the abbot was envisioned."}]
