[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":" Those who are informed about the history of the Ordo Saturni know that one of the predecessors of the OS was the Pansophia Loge (or Pansophic Lodge) in Germany who was under the leadership of Master Recnartus. Below is the obituary for Master Recnartus by Gregor A. Gregorius the founder of The Fraternitas Saturni out of which the Ordo Saturni evolved. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Obituary for Master ∴Recnartus∴ (From: Blätter für angewandte occulted Lebenskunst July 1956) On May 22, 1956 the Great Demiurge Saturnus opened his dark portal for the only still existing Rosicrucian Master of the present time – for Frater ∴Recnartus∴, alias Heinrich Tränker. With him one of the last mystics of the old guard of our time passed on into the mental sphere. Frater Recnartus was not only a true Rosicrucian, but also the Grandmaster for Germany of the Pansophic Lodges. That this Lodge was not able to evolve according to his wishes has its reason in the serious discord between Master Recnartus and the World-Master Therion, alias Aleister Crowley. Master Recnartus never recovered from this big quarrel the more so that at that time the Orient Berlin of his Pansophic Lodge closed down, was extinguished and went dark. As a true mystic Recnartus continued to live quietly, always striving to help as a co-worker in the spiritual development of mankind. He remained secluded, the more so he was not able to find a true successor. In the esoteric sense he was the last exponent of the mysticism of the Piscean Age and he was also called the Henkelkreuzmann (Henkelkleuzman in English means: Ankh-Man). That this mysticism of the Piscean Age was fading more and more, and could not withstand the brazen influence of the two-beat rhythm of the new Uranian Age of Aquarius was not his fault. In his workings Recnartus was an autodidact of the purest waters and based his work above all on the mystic Christian Friedrich Krause, on Tauler, on Swedenborg, Jakob Böhme and other mystics of the middle ages. The place which he held in the row of the leading esotericist in Germany likely will remain empty, probably for a long time and cannot easily be replaced. The partly quite friendly and personal relationship between me and Recnartus lasted for more than 50 years and often lead to conjoint workings that lasted for years. Recnartus was a Master in the “OTO” and made it possible for me to become a member of that Order after he trained me confidentially for years. He was also a Grade holder in the “Orden der goldenen Dämmerung” (Golden Dawn) and different other hermetic secret societies who unfortunately were published and prohibited in the Reichsgestzblatt after the overthrow in 1933. Recnartus was one of the “silent” ones in the land of mysticism and we honor with this his memory. "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Gregor A.
