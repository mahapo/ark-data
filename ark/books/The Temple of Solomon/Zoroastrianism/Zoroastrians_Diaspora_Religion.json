It wasa great honour to be invited to deliver such a prestigious seriesof lectures. The previous Katrak lecturer had been my mentor,Prof. Mary Boyce.1Her research for these lectures was so inno-vative and scholarly that she was awarded the Burton Gold Medalby the Royal Asiatic Society. Her fieldwork among orthodoxZoroastrians in remote villages of Iran, where the religion hadbeen practised traditionally and with devotion for millennia,caused her to question the scholarly presuppositions that haddominated the subject for a century. It transformed her ownperspective, and she has subsequently influenced the assumptionsof those who have come after her.2Following such groundbreak-ing research by one’s own teacher was a daunting prospect. I amgrateful to the Trustees of the Katrak lectureship for inviting meto do so, even if somewhat overwhelmed.As I had undertaken research for these lectures for the previousthree years, I have been working on this book for a total of twentyyears, or—put another way—for one third of my life. I am gratefulto the Trustees and to the Clarendon Press for their patience andgood will, and for their acceptance of what had been intendedas just one chapter,Zoroastrians in Britain, published as a separatevolume in 1996. In one sense, this book is Volume 2 of thoselectures. There have been many reasons for its long gestation.A major factor has been the extent of the fieldwork involved.It has included several visits to India, two to Pakistan, three toHong Kong, as well as trips to Zanzibar, Kenya, France, Germany,several visits to communities in different parts of Canada and theUSA, and two to Australia. I estimate that this research hasinvolved approximately 250,000 miles of travel.

The most serious of all problems was the deathin 1996 of my much-loved wife Marianne, who had been themainstay of my life for thirty-five years.Obviously such global travel, and the worldwide survey ques-tionnaire that I undertook, was financially expensive. I am deeplygrateful to many bodies and individuals for their support: to theuniversities of Oxford, Manchester, Hong Kong, LondonUniversity (SOAS); the British Academy and the Spalding Trusts;and among Zoroastrians, the Aresh, Rivetna and Treasureywalafamilies. Numerous individuals have helped in various ways:Burjor and Zarin Avari, the Avari family in Karachi, Shahpur F.Captain, Ruby Cooper, Rusi and Roshan Dalal, Malcolm Deboo,Dolly Dastoor, the Dotiwala family in Houston, Maria Leontiner,the Marker family in Karachi, Jimmy Master, Cyrus and ViraspMehta, Silloo and Fali Mehta, Shirin and Jimmy Mistry, KhojesteMistree, Homai Modi, Sam and Phiroza Nariman, Jehangir Patel,the late Jamshed Pavri and his wife Roda, Godrej Sidhwa,Dinshaw Tamboly, Gillian Towler Mehta and her family. I amalso very grateful to Nyrmla Singh, who took a break from herown postgraduate studies to undertake a visit to Zanzibar andKenya when I was unable for medical reasons to go. SimilarlyI wish to record my profound thanks to Sarah Longair for goingto Sydney and Melbourne to update my material when healthagain prevented me from travelling. Both of them producedvaluable data. I wish to record particular thanks to Belinda Baker,for her outstanding professional competence in copy-editing thisbook. She noted and corrected countless mistakes on my part.I am also very grateful to Nora Firby for her care in preparing theindex, a large task with a book of this length. I wish also to expressmy profound thanks to the OUP cartographer who produced themaps. I am also grateful to the doctors who have cared for me,above all my orthopaedic surgeons Mr Kevin Hardinge andMr Fred Robinson; my own doctor, Dr Emma Baldwin, has beena model of professional wisdom and kindness.In addition to members of my family, other individuals whomerit special thanks are the Revd Professor Christopher Evans,who first inspired in me the love of academic studies; and DasturDr JamaspAsa, friend and guide in Parsi matters.

Zaehner, notoriously, entitled his clas-sic work The Dawn and Twilight of Zoroastrianism,1with the twilightbeing the end of the Sasanian era in the seventh century CE.There have been some studies of Zoroastrians in Islamic Iran,2and a number of the Parsis in India.3Only Boyce has written onboth Iranian Zoroastrians and the Parsis.4The only scholar toundertake a comparative study of the Parsi diaspora has beenmy friend, and former student, Rashna Writer, who looked atZoroastrians in Britain, America, Canada and Pakistan;5otherwisethere is only my own Zoroastrians in Britain.6The point is that theZoroastrian diaspora has been mostly ignored by scholars. Thecentral conviction behind this book is that the diaspora groupshave made a significant role in the development of the communityand the religion in the old country. Sir Jamsetji Jijibhoy is famousfor both his communal and his cosmopolitan charities, notably ineducation and religion, but he was only able to do this because ofthe fortune he made in China. Similarly, the Cowasji Dinshawswere able to undertake such vast philanthropic work because oftheir business success in Aden and East Africa.

Unfortunately he ignoresthe religion of the Parsis.4Zoroastrians: Their Religious Beliefs and Practices, London, repr. 2000.5Zoroastrians: An Unstructured Nation, Lanham, 1994.6Oxford, 1996."},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"was a key political figure in the Indian National Congress, butmuch of that role owed a great deal to his work in Britain, in par-ticular his role as MP in the Westminster Parliament. Parsis arejustly proud of two prominent (and contrasting) musicians, ZubinMehta and Freddie Mercury, whose fame and fortunes were madein the diaspora. The diaspora communities are also important intheir own right, not least because of the contributions each hasmade to its ‘new country’. For example, it was a Parsi who took thecrucial steps to build the University of Hong Kong. Parsis werecrucial in the development of Zanzibar’s port as a diversified mar-ket place, and in building the town into a modern ‘city’. At the turnof the millennium, diaspora Zoroastrians are having a substantialimpact on religious debates in India and Iran, just as diasporicfunding continues to support long-treasured Parsi Institutions inIndia.7Similarly, the moves for a world body have been led fromthe diaspora.8What happens in one Zoroastrian community, intimes of globalization, affects others. Unquestionably the study ofthe ancient religion in the old country is important, but to under-stand Zoroastrianism in the modern world, even in the nineteenthcentury, it is essential to study diasporic groups. Many Zoroastriansbelieve that with the demographic decline in the Parsi communityin India, the future of the world’s oldest prophetic/revealedreligion lies in the New World.This is the first book to undertake a study of Zoroastrians notonly in Independent India but also in the ‘old’ nineteenth-centurydiaspora in China; in the province formerly known as Sind; inEast Africa and London; as well as in the newer communities inGermany, France, Canada, the USA and Australia. The patternof research behind each chapter has been to visit the countriesnamed to study the archives there, to stay with Zoroastrian fam-ilies in order to see or ‘feel’ the diaspora groups from within.A global survey was undertaken which yielded 1,840 responses toquestions on demographic issues (age, gender, composition, lengthof residence, second-generation responses), religious beliefs andpractices, and secular culture (language, food, music, etc.) In part,Introduction27The obvious example of this is the substantial funds donated by the Jokhi Trusts in HongKong to the Parsee General Hospital in Mumbai; see Parsiana, Feb.–Mar. 1995, pp. 92–100and Apr. 2002, pp. 18–22.8The World Zoroastrian Organization (discussed in Ch. 10) was started in London; thekey moves for another international federation have been led from America."},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"Introduction3therefore, this book is a historical work involving archival sources;it has involved anthropological participant observation and socio-logical data analysis. In addition, I believe that I have read all thebooks published by Parsis in the last thirty years, both in the oldcountry and the diaspora. My aim has been to document theremarkable histories and achievements of the various Zoroastriancommunities around the world. It has also been to compare thedifferent experiences, strategies, hopes and fears in the variouscountries. One of the basic questions asked is, how different is itbeing a Zoroastrian in, say, Hong Kong and Australia, or in LosAngeles and London? How do different immigration and racepolicies impact upon a religious minority? The study has alsocompared the experiences of Zoroastrians in large centres such asToronto, where there are 3,000–4,000 Zoroastrians with a well-established ‘centre’ or building, and in small, scattered groupswith few community networks and even fewer resources, such asthe groups in Germany and France. It is important also to com-pare communities within countries, because it cannot be taken forgranted that different cities in the same country are of a single‘type’. In America, for example, there are important differencesbetween the communities in Houston and in Chicago, as there arebetween those in Sydney and Melbourne in Australia.In much contemporary scholarly writing, for example in anthro-pology and on religion, it has become common for scholars to‘locate’ themselves, to identify their biases, presuppositions, andrelations with the arena where they study. In my case this is essen-tial, because while I seek never to take sides in community disputes,I am nevertheless conscious of a bias in my approach and use ofsources. Numerous Parsis in many countries have become closepersonal friends in the course of my stays in different places. Manyof the names referred to in this book are those of people for whomI have a deep respect and affection. I have stayed with them attimes of celebrations such as initiations and weddings, and sharedtheir grief as deaths have occurred in the homes while I have beenstaying there, just as they shared my grief when my wife died.I have acted as confidant to a number, and they have been myconfidants at crucial moments. Sometimes, people I consider to beclose friends have been vigorous opponents, in some cases eventaking each other to court. I have been present at many of the bit-ter disputes referred to in the book. Writing the scholarly ‘neutral’"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"or ‘objective’ account has been a difficult task. Most of my closefriends are naturally people of my generation. Although I hopeI have sought carefully to pay attention to the views and concerns ofthe youth, it is perhaps inevitable that my writing commonly reflectsthe view of people of my own age. Because many of my friends,especially in Mumbai, come from the Orthodox or traditional wingof the community, there is an obvious danger that I may not give abalanced account of bitter community debates. The biggest bias, orimbalance of sources, and the one which I most regret, is that con-tacts with the Iranian Zoroastrian community are not as close asthey are with Parsis. In the 1970s I visited Iran many times, but thathas not been possible since the establishment of the IslamicRepublic in 1979. Although Iranian Zoroastrians and Parsis havepreserved much of their common ancient heritage, there are never-theless differences, some substantial, not only in secular culture(notably language, food, and music) but also in religion. Perhaps it isinevitable that immersing oneself in either group will inevitablyresult in a less deep understanding of the other. Of course, I havemany Iranian Zoroastrian friends in various countries and I havesought to represent their concerns also, but this book leaves a gap,which it is to be hoped another scholar will fill by undertaking aninternational comparative study of Iranian Zoroastrians around theworld. I considered using the word ‘Parsi’ in the title of the bookbecause of my awareness of my contacts. But because of the num-ber of my Iranian friends, especially in Vancouver, California,Germany and London, and the importance and impact of IranianZoroastrians in the diaspora, it would have been wrong to excludethem. There is a further important factor. Many younger mem-bers of the international communities no longer wish to be knownby what they see as purely ethnic markers, namely Parsis andIranians, but simply as Zoroastrians; so that is the title I have usedin the book.Communities around the world have trusted me with unrivalledaccess to their archives. In centres as far apart as Toronto, Londonand Hong Kong I have been given open access to any of the filesI have asked to read. They have all been willing to discuss anyquestion I raised. Inevitably, not everyone in every community isa saint, and I do know of some scandals, but I have rarely referredto them. Each chapter has been sent to at least one member,usually more, of the communities I am writing about, to ensureIntroduction4"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"that the text is accurate. In discussing disputes I have sought todepersonalize them and have used as bland a style of writing aspossible. Some of my academic colleagues will consider this afailure of objective, neutral, factual historical writing. However, Ialso believe an academic has to be sensitive to the consequencesof his/her work. We are not remote and distant from what westudy; we do not live in a vacuum. Generally I have sought torespect the feelings of individuals, but this cannot always be done.What we write does, for better or for worse, influence the peoplewe write about. After the publication of my Zoroastrians in BritainIfound that I had unwittingly caused distress and offence to oneperson because I had expressed my gratitude for help given in afootnote where I had used the material and not in the prefacewhere it was felt it would have been more prominent. In this book,as in the first, I have acknowledged help at the point in the textwhere the material relates to the specific help given. Some peoplehave given me help over many years and in a broad rather than aspecific manner. I have acknowledged their help in the generalintroduction because it is not possible to say they helped me witha precise detail. I do not intend discourtesy to anyone by thankinghim or her in a relevant footnote. It is certainly my earnest hopethat my writing never causes offence.In each chapter I have identified the nature and potential biasin my sources. Records such as minutes of meetings have theappearance of primary sources, but they may reflect only oneperspective on the issues discussed and they are frequently bland.Wherever possible I have consulted the views of different partic-ipants in the debates. However, fortunately for the historian, Parsidiasporic communities have a strong tradition of making andkeeping community records, so that the sources are therefore oftenextensive. Many Parsis are eager to learn, and to write about, theirown community. Their results are not always published, but typedand circulated. A number of such writers have generously given mecopies of their writings. I am grateful to all of them, because theirworks have nuggets of historical gold in them that would never haveotherwise been known. I have, of course, acknowledged thesesources in the relevant footnotes.Whatever the problems of this study, and the joys, it is—froma Zoroastrian studies perspective—an attempt to document andanalyse the global spread of the religion. There is no reliableIntroduction5"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"information on the global Zoroastrian population. Governmentfigures in Iran suggest a far more numerous following there than wasthought; the latest published figures claim there are more than100,000 in the mother country. The number of Parsis in India isdeclining. The 1991 census showed a slight increase, and some inIndia insist that because of migration the total population remainsreasonably constant around 100,000 to 120,000 (excluding anunknown number in Iran). The figures for deaths so regularlyexceed the number of births in India, that the figure in the old coun-try can be expected to continue to decline.9In the diaspora, by con-trast, the numbers can be expected to increase, because it is mainlyyoung people who have migrated and so the number of births canbe expected to exceed deaths over the next two or three decades.But whatever the numerical total of Zoroastrians globally, there canbe no doubt that Zoroastrians are now found in more countriesaround the world than at any previous time in the history of thisancient and noble religion. There have been Zoroastrian diasporasbefore: during the Achaemenid, Parthian and Sasanian eras (fromthe sixth century BCEto the seventh century CE), Zoroastrianstravelled for conquest and trade, but they did not go to such distantclimes as America and Australia, though they did go to China. AsZoroastrians are now spread around more countries than everbefore, and as the numbers, in the case of the Parsis at least, appearto be declining, the study of those migrations, their achievements,patterns of settlements, and the consequences of migration becomematters of great significance for the study of Zoroastrianism.Zoroastrians typically do not consider themselves part of the(South) Asian diaspora. Parsis see themselves as generally beingon good terms with other people from India or Pakistan; somewould identify themselves as Indians. Iranian Zoroastrians gener-ally see themselves as distinct from Iranian Muslims, even thoughon occasions they share festivals. Zoroastrians wish to assert theirown unique identity as Zoroastrians, or the ‘real’, ‘true’Iranians/Persians. But viewed from the outside they are seen aspart of the South Asian diaspora, and Iranian Zoroastrianspart of the Iranian exodus. They have been subject to the sameIntroduction69The internationally read Parsi magazine,Parsiana, gives in each issue the details of therecorded births, marriages and deaths. Its figures for Mumbai may not be completely accur-ate, but they are undoubtedly substantially correct."},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"immigration and race relations law; they have generally migratedat the same time and were subject to similar problems, for exam-ple, racial discrimination. In an ideal world it would have beengood to consider other South Asian and Iranian groups in each ofthe countries studied. While this can be done to great advantagewith one destination, as Baumann has done with Southall inLondon,10it is simply impossible in one lifetime to undertake suchcomparative work in every location discussed in this book.Nevertheless I have tried to read studies of other communities ineach country with a view to being able to identify what is a com-mon diasporic experience and what is distinctly Zoroastrian.A Question of ScaleOne problem in writing this book has been the question of scale.The study covers eleven countries and has involved living in andreading the records in twenty-four cities around the world. Thishas involved seeking to understand the context of the Zoroastriancommunities in very diverse historical, political and culturalsettings. In covering such a range of countries and topics it wasimportant to be ruthless in focusing directly on what was relevantto my subject. I am conscious of curtailing discussion of manyinteresting topics, of some important theoretical issues or of con-temporary historical external events. Attention has been focuseddirectly on what I judged to be essential to the Zoroastriancommunity. It was, for example, not possible to write about Parsisin Karachi without studying the history of Pakistan, or in HongKong without studying Sino-British relations, or Zanzibar withoutreading East African history, or in America without studying thehistory of immigration and multicultural polices. In writing therelevant chapters it has been necessary to set out that context, butbecause of the huge libraries of reading that could have beenundertaken, it has been essential to be selective and focus on onlythose issues that impacted on the Zoroastrian communities. Forexample, while reading and writing on Karachi Parsis I paid littleattention to the war which saw the birth of Bangladesh. While ofIntroduction710M. Baumann,Contesting Culture: Discourses of Identity in Multi-ethnic, Cambridge, 1996."},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"huge importance in the history of Pakistan, it had relatively littleimpact on the Parsis. (Apart from the fact that there were Parsigenerals on both sides; indeed, the Parsi Field Marshal SamManeckshaw commanded the Indian army!) But other thanproviding heroes, that war did not have a direct or significanteffect on the Parsi communities in either country.While writing about Parsis in India I have focused mainly onBombay. This choice is logical in that Bombay/Mumbai is themain centre of Indian Parsis, where all the major institutionsare located with which diasporic leaders engage, and it is the cityfrom which most Parsis have migrated. That leaves out Parsisin Calcutta, Pune, Madras and Bangalore, not to mention thehistorically important communities in Gujarat. There are severalother diaspora groups I would dearly have liked to study, notablythose in Aden, Singapore11and South Africa among the ‘older’settlements, the Gulf States and New Zealand among more recentgroupings. I hope the opportunity will come for me to researchthose communities also. There is another topic which I consideredincluding. Since the 1960s a number of groups from CentralAsia have claimed Zoroastrian ancestry. The first time I cameacross them was in Tehran in the early 1970s when a number ofIntroduction811Mary Clemmey kindly lent me a file of papers concerning her family history. The firstParsi known to have moved to Singapore was a convict. It was his approaching death thatprompted others who had settled there to obtain land for a cemetery in 1827. More Parsissettled in 1829. One of the early leading figures among the Parsis was Framruze SorabjeeSattana, who started business in Singapore in 1840. He was the only non-European amongthe first shareholders to fund a library in 1844. He became a prominent Freemason. His son,Cursetjee Frommurze, entered a business partnership with John M. Little in 1845 asAuctioneers and Commission Agents. In 1862 Cursetjee married out of the community, toan English woman, Maryanne. This was the marriage from which Mary is descended andthe reason for her search for her family history. Little took over the business and it eventuallybecame a famous departmental store (Robinsons). In the mid-19th c. another eminent Parsiwas Dhunjibhoy Hormusji, who became a member of the Grand Jury. A family member ofthe firm Byramjee Hormusji Cama & Co started a free school for Chinese children. Anothermajor Parsi of the 19th c. was Edaljee Khory, a lawyer, who had a Masonic Lodge namedafter him in 1891. In 1903 Navroji Mistri settled in Singapore and started an aerated watercompany before venturing into real estate and the restaurant business. The road next to hisfactory was named Navroji Road after him. He brought other Parsis to the island. Numberswere small but several of them became prominent citizens.

Furthermore, there havebeen accounts of the Parsis in British India, notably that of Kulkeand the excellent recent publication by Palsetia, which unlikeKulke deals with questions of religion.14There has been virtuallynothing published on Zoroastrians in the other settlements.However, there has also been almost nothing published on BombayParsis since Indian Independence.15It was important to providea reasonably substantial account of Parsis in modern Bombay/Mumbai because one of the key themes in this book is the inter-action between the diaspora communities and those in the oldcountry. Their interaction is crucial for an understanding of theParsi diaspora. (The impossibility of a comparable study of inter-action with Iran has already been noted, with regret.)The tight focus of this book is on the period from the mid-1960sto the late 1980s, the period of the greatest migration activityamong Parsis from India, Pakistan and East Africa; it covers thefall of the Shah and the departure of many Iranian Zoroastriansfrom the old country. It was also the period when a world bodywas formed. The global survey undertaken for this book providesa picture at the end of that period of intense activity and a basis foran analysis of trends. With the older diasporas it was essential togive the earlier historical context, since the only single book on theseZoroastrian diasporas is my Zoroastrians in Britain. The publisherswere, however, keen that I include Britain in this book also, so thatit is reasonably comprehensive. In order to avoid mere repetitionand summary, France and Germany are included (as the British-based body is known as the Zoroastrian Trust Funds of Europe).The section on Mancherjee Bhownaggree has been revised in thelight of John Mcleod’s fine research, not yet published, on this ToryMP.

Most chapters follow a similarpattern. After looking at the relevant history of the region beingstudied, a brief depiction of the Zoroastrian community in thatregion based on my survey is given, followed by a discussion of howthat community has grown, and the chapter ends with a considera-tion of events in the 1990s.It has been difficult to be consistent on the spelling of Parsinames. It is common for modern western writers to replace the ‘ee’in various names with an ‘i’, for example Parsee becomes Parsi,Jeejeebhoy becomes Jijibhoy. There is a case for spelling nameshow the person referred to spelt it, for example ‘Bhownaggree’ not‘Bhownagree’, but that can look odd in the context of widespreadcontemporary spelling. Where a person has left substantial per-sonal records I have generally followed that spelling, even thoughit leads to inconsistencies in spelling the same name used by differ-ent people. Even here it is difficult to be consistent, for Parsis them-selves do not strictly follow one spelling of their name for examplewith the common suffix ‘walla’ or ‘wala’. Some of the non-Parsisources, for example the Jardine Archive in Cambridge used inChapter 4 on China, used idiosyncratic spelling, often not recog-nizing the difference between personal and family names. There isanother problem of consistency. Parsis use a person’s father’s nameas their middle name, but this is not always available in the sourcesused. It has been included where possible. I have included, usuallyin footnotes, the names of early traders and migrants, for examplein Canton, Hong Kong and East Africa, in the hope of tracingfamily and trading connections.The Theoretical PerspectiveIntroductionMany of the terms used in this book raise questions of theory andmethod in the wider field of religious, sociological and anthropo-logical studies.16Words commonly used in the following chaptersIntroduction1116I wish to record my thanks to Prof. Kim Knott of Leeds for reading through thissection for me, and not only saving me from some errors, but also improving the structure ofthe discussion significantly.

InZoroastrians in Britain(pp. 44–9) I discussed my use of many ofthese terms; they are used in the same sense here to avoid confu-sion for anyone looking at both books. But there are terms thatneed to be used here which were not discussed in that book. In myopinion, terming the new place of settlement ‘the host society’ isinappropriate. Many western societies have either not been goodhosts, or have largely ignored any duty to the settlers. It is com-monly the communities, in this case Zoroastrians, who have actedas hosts to the ‘newcomers’. Throughout this book, therefore,I have used the phrases ‘old country’ and ‘new country’ as advisedby Rashna Writer. ‘Homeland’ I have generally used to referto Iran, the ‘real’ homeland for most Zoroastrians, even if theancestors of most diasporic Zoroastrians have lived on the Indiansubcontinent for a millennium.Some place namesA brief note is necessary on the use of the terms ‘Iran’ and‘Persia’. Technically, the former is the correct name for the coun-try throughout its history, because Persia is only a province in thesouth-west of the country. For much of Iranian history Persia wasthe province from which the ruling dynasties came, for example,during the Achaemenid and Sasanian times. For those eras thename ‘Persia’ is a reasonable name for the whole. However, manydiaspora Zoroastrians in the New World prefer to use the term‘Persia’ rather than the current official name of the country,‘Iran’, in order to evoke the memories of pre-Islamic Iran. Inwhat follows, Iran will be used in a secular context, but ‘Persia’when referring to the Zoroastrian perceptions of their homeland.An explanation is also due of the terms ‘West’ and ‘NewWorld’. It is illogical to include Australia under the term ‘West’; asseen from the Indian, Pakistan and Iranian perspectives it is to theeast. ‘The West’ is a common expression in the media generally,and in Zoroastrian writing, to refer to the countries which are his-torically derived from European, mostly British, legal and admin-istrative origins. The term ‘New World’ is also illogical in view ofthe extremely long history of the Inuit and other North Americantraditions, which the invaders drove into small settlements. ButIntroduction12"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"again, it is a common expression in the media and in Zoroastrianliterature. In this context the ‘New World’ includes Australiaas part of the West. As part of the drive to change British streetand town names and invoke ancient Indian forms in the 1990s,Bombay was officially changed to Mumbai. Generally I have triedto use Bombay when referring to the pre-1990s and Mumbaithereafter. It was sometimes difficult to be consistent in this.‘Culture’‘Culture’ is a highly contested term in religious, social and anthro-pological fields. It is the subject of countless books and articles. Onebasic question is whether religion is part of culture or culture partof religion. But the debates are far more complex than this simplepoint.17In this context, I intend to point to what Zoroastrians them-selves commonly see as their ‘culture’, that which marks them off asdistinctive from other religious or racial communities. For many thiswould include religion, but not for all, because there are atheistswho would wish to identify themselves as Zoroastrians. For themtheir ‘culture’ can indicate food, music, language, or personal andsocial values, notably family connections and responsibilities,charitable work, the much-quoted ethical triad of Good Thoughts,Good Words, Good Deeds, and above all, perhaps, their history. Itcould also include humour and for the older generation of Parsis tra-ditionaldramas (nataks). Iranian Zoroastrian ‘culture’ is commonlyseen as being somewhat different, albeit the two worlds overlapconsiderably. Language is yet more important to Iranians than toParsis, as is (Iranian) music. There is particular Iranian enjoyment ofcertain festivals (the gahambars). For some the bonds of ‘Iranian-ness’can mean links with other Iranians, including Muslims, rather thanParsis, especially in the New Year celebration, No Ruz. Nationalityand culture are closely linked for Iranian Zoroastrians who have feltcompelled to leave their homeland. Different Zoroastrians wouldIntroduction1317It may be dangerous to point to any specific articles, because of the risk of giving anunrepresentative perspective on the debate. But for anyone wishing to gain an impression ofthe complexity of the discussions, a reasonable starting point is R. Williams,Culture and Society,1750–1950, New York, 1958. Two useful overviews of the debates are T. Masuzawa,‘Culture’, in M. C. Taylor,Critical Terms for Religious Studies, Chicago, 1998, pp. 70–93 andM.

In a discussion of theinternational scene that is even more the case. Zoroastrians andcommentators use the term ‘the community’ to refer to the globalZoroastrian diaspora as well as a small local group, which may noteven be formally established. It is worth repeating the argumentthat ‘Even if the historian considers this entity to be mythical, it isnevertheless a powerful myth, which affects the sense of self-identityamong Zoroastrians. The term therefore has value, even if theabove qualification is necessary.’ I still hold to that value of themyth, and am relieved to find that other scholars find the term‘community’ useful, even if it and the group are vague and in flux.18BoundariesVarious scholars have drawn attention to the importance ofboundaries for communities: who ‘patrols’ them, why and how?19There are differing perceptions of how people reach out beyondthose boundaries to the wider society. In the 1980s these discus-sions focused on the second and third generation being ‘caughtbetween cultures’.20However, an important contributor to thatIntroduction1418Two books which I have found useful in reflections on this topic are A.

Ballard also stresses that diasporicmembers adapt to wider society on their own terms.21He empha-sizes that the second and third generation are not mere pawnsin the control of outsiders. While not wanting to dispute thispoint totally, Vertovec offers the counter argument that this cansound too much like ‘rational choice theory, and that peopleare ever aware of what they are doing and are selectingpaths which will give them what they seek’.22These are issueswhich will be considered with reference to Zoroastrians in theConclusion.TraditionOne reviewer ofZoroastrians in Britainquestioned my use of theterm ‘tradition’, especially in the singular, for example whenwriting about the ‘transmission of tradition’. Obviously thereare a variety of traditions, Parsi, Iranian, Orthodox, Liberal, etc.However, it is my contention that any one person at any one timeadheres to a particular tradition. That tradition, of course, may berecast in a different situation or over time. Traditions are notstatic; even those thought of as ancient have been reformulated,recast, revised.23Similarly as ‘traditions’ change, so does‘ethnicity’.Hastingswrites about the ‘real’ genetic and the mythicgenetic origins of ethnicity.24The fact that there are many andchanging traditions or ethnicities does not preclude the use of thesingular when referring to a specific instance or process.MulticulturalismAn area which has been sadly neglected in the study of religionsis the impact of multiculturalism on participants in multiculturalIntroduction1521R.

Baumann is one of the few scholars to address thisquestion directly.25It is essential to be precise concerning what is,and what is not, being discussed. There is clearly a huge body ofliterature on inter-faith dialogue circling round such issues ashow a believer in the truth of one religion can hold a dialoguewith someone with a different belief system.26The point here isperhaps a more phenomenological one: what is the impact ofreligious minorities engaging in dialogue with establishedChristian denominations? How does it affect their own beliefs andpractices? For some participants, ‘inter-faith dialogue’ is lookingfor common patterns, or shared beliefs, maybe even movingtowards a universalist faith. Multiculturalism is a liberal concernto aid understanding between religious groups, i.e. the aim isnot to change people’s religion, but to operate with the convictionthat if each knows more about the other, the result will be greaterunderstanding and tolerance. (Rarely does it address the possibil-ity that if people know more about another religion, they mayreject it more vigorously.) What is the impact of inviting peoplefrom another religion into one’s own temple? This is especiallyimportant for Zoroastrians because in India only Parsis can enterthe temples. How does having other religious groups comingto observe worship affect the Zoroastrian experience? In speak-ing to each other there is a tendency for religious minoritiesto explain things in Christian terms, referring for example toDiwali as ‘our Christmas’, or describing Muslim and Sikh leadersas priests. What are the consequences of, say, Hindus havinga Christmas tree and exchanging Christmas presents?

From theChristian side it tends to be the more ‘liberal’ groups of the estab-lishment who are represented rather than, say, fundamentalists(unless they are seeking to convert). What are the consequencesof people from the various religions taking part in a ‘multi-faith’act of worship? Do the participants carry this liberal, perhapsunrepresentative, image of the other religions back into their owncommunity? It is not uncommon to find that the representativesof the diasporic religious groups become the ‘gate keepers’ oftheir religion in their region; the interpreters of their religion tothe outside world and the filters through which the other religionsare viewed by many of their own community. It is common forthem to formulate an account of their religion designed to stimu-late respect from others, to explain things in easily comprehensi-ble terms, leaving out the beliefs, practices and attitudes whichothers may find alien. A sanitized, anodyne or universalistaccount is often given, which may in fact gain credence withintheir own community. Representing one’s community in multi-faith activities gives status to those who represent the group, espe-cially if this involves meeting such people as British royalty, thePresident of the USA, the Pope or the Dalai Lama.DiasporaThe term and concept requiring most discussion here is ‘diaspora’.It is a much-used and debated term. It is important not simplybecause the word is used in the title of the book (though as we shallsee some scholars have denied that the Parsis are a diaspora), buteven more because seeing Zoroastrians as a diaspora comparableto other groups, such as Sikhs, Hindus, etc., enables comparisonsthat I am convinced help in the understanding of contexts and pat-terns, strategies, and above all distinctive features of Zoroastrians(or their ancestors) who have migrated.Introduction1727See e.g. K.

The first academic to press for the value of studying religiousdiasporas in the modern world was Ninian Smart.30He raisedvarious issues which have later become matters of debate beyondthe field of Religious Studies, for example the relations of dia-sporas with their old countries. He drew attention to the fact that,contrary to external perception, diasporic communities are notalways ‘westernized’ and ‘liberal’; some incline to be no lessorthodox than those in the old country. Further, he drew attentionto the practice of constructing a universalist picture of the reli-gion and pointed to the patterns of religious transformationcommon in many diaspora communities. His article did notinclude an extensive discussion of what is meant by ‘diaspora’other than noting that in ‘many diasporas there is an element ofexile’.

Tölölyan,who launched the journal Diaspora, produced an interestingoverview of the movement of the subject in the early years of thejournal’s life.32He points to six overlapping concepts: diaspora,ethnicity, nationalism, transnational links, globalization and ‘post-coloniality’. He comments that whereas ‘diaspora’ was ‘a termonce saturated with meanings of loss, dislocation, powerlessnessand plain pain’ before it became a useful way of describing dis-persions, it has now become ‘a synonym for related phenomenarecently covered by distinct terms like expatriate, exile, ethnicminority, refugee, migrant, sojourner and overseas community’(pp. 9 f.) When authors sought ‘an ideal type’ of ‘diaspora’ follow-ing the Jewish model, the key features were seen to be coercion,which led to uprooting and resettlement, a clear concept and col-lective memory of the homeland, a yearning for a return to thathomeland, and community ‘patrolling its boundaries’. Diasporas,Tölölyan said, keep contact with the homeland, either with the‘mythicized idea of homeland’ or with its physical place of origin.(p. 14).S. Vertovec, in a substantial review of literature about and theoriesof ‘diaspora’, identifies three discernible meanings in the concept‘diaspora’ in recent (1997) writing on the subject.33These are:1.Diaspora as social form, notably specific social relationshipscemented by special ties to history and geography, created asa result of voluntary or forced migration to at least two othercountries; collective identities being sustained by reference to anethnic myth of common origin and a tie to a special place; theinstitutionalizing of networks of exchange and communication; themaintenance of explicit and implicit ties with the homelands;solidarity with co-ethnic members in countries of settlement; a senseof not being fully accepted, alienation or exclusion by the ‘hostsociety’. The second set of discernible meanings, he says,are the tensions of political orientations, with divided loyaltiesIntroduction1932‘Rethinking Diaspora(s): Stateless Power in the Transnational Moment’,Diaspora, 5:1,1996, pp. 3–36.33‘Three Meanings of “Diaspora,” Exemplified among South Asian Religions’,Diaspora, 6:3, 1997, pp. 277–99.

Writers also emphasize the ‘triadic’ relationships: theglobal ethnic dispersion, the places where they live, and the home-land states.2.Diaspora as a type of consciousness. Other writers, he notes,emphasize the variety of experiences, states of mind and a sense ofidentity. Two key factors are the negative experience of discrimi-nation and exclusion and a positive link to their historical heritage.The awareness of ‘multi-locality’ gives a sense of both ‘here’ and‘there’, a sense of roots and routes. Some emphasize diasporasleaving a trail of collective memory, and creating new ‘maps ofdesire and attachment’. Others emphasize the self-questioningstimulated in the diaspora, for example ‘routine habitual religiouspractice, rote learning and “blind faith” are no longer operational.’A further aspect of diaspora as a type of consciousness is the num-ber of diasporic persons continuing to visit the subcontinent onpilgrimage. Vertovec points to Baumann’s assertion that ‘whateverone does and thinks is intrinsically and distinctively culturebound.’34However, he also draws attention to Knott and Khokhers’ study,which notes how some young Muslim women distinguishedbetween the ‘culture’ of their parents, who conformed to ethnictraditions emblematic of religion, e.g. dress, and the culture of theyoung, who wished to adopt a simple Muslim identity.3.Diaspora as a mode of cultural production. Viewing diaspora com-munities in the context of globalization, various writers emphas-ize the fluid identities among diasporic people, or the hybridmixing of identities in different contexts, not least among theyouth, whose socialization has taken place in different culturalcontexts. This may include the ‘retraditonalization’ of key con-cepts and their different understanding of tradition.Typologies of diasporasSeveral scholars have sought to produce typologies of diasporas.The study that discusses this in most detail is Cohen.35He tried toIntroduction2034Baumann,Contesting Cultures, p. 107.35Robin Cohen,Global Diasporas: An Introduction, London, 1997.

He identifies the following typesand illustrates them by specific examples: victim ( Jewish andArmenian), labour (Indian), trade (Chinese), imperial (British)and cultural (Afro-Caribbean). He acknowledges that these typescan change in the course of time, and that some diaspora groupsfit more than one typology. For a group to be identified as a typeof diaspora he lists the following necessary common features:1. Dispersal from an original homeland, often traumatically, totwo or more foreign regions.2. An expansion from a homeland (in search of work or forcolonial ambitions).3. A collective memory and myth about the homeland, includingits location, history and achievements.4. An idealization of the putative homeland and collective com-mitment to its maintenance, restoration, safety and prosperity,even to its creation.5.

The orientation towards the homeland cen-ter can be a symbolic ritual...It may manifest itself in philanthropicconcern . . . an ethnic community differs from a diaspora by the extentto which that latter’s commitment to maintain connections with its home-land and its kin in others states is absent, weak or at best intermittent, andmanifested by individuals rather than the community as a whole. Forexample, Italian Americans can be classified as ethnics; their links areassociated in a fragmentary way with food, music and special occasions.37Tölölyan acknowledges that the nature of groups can change fromethnic to diasporic, or the reverse, according to circumstances.Brah also questions the importance of the ‘return motif ’:Where is ‘home?’ On the one hand ‘home’ is a mythic place of desire inthe diasporic imagination. In this sense it is a place of no return, even ifit is possible to visit the geographical territory that is seen as the place of‘origin’....The word diaspora often invokes the imagery of traumas ofseparation and dislocation and this is certainly a very important aspectof the migratory experience. But diasporas are also potentially the sitesof hope and new beginnings.38Introduction2236J.

Anthias offers a different definition:‘Diaspora’ references a connection between groups across differentnation states whose commonality derives from an original but mayberemoved homeland; a new identity becomes constructed on a worldscale, which crosses national borders and boundaries.She rejects the label ‘ethnic minority’ because it assumes the dom-inant group does not have an ethnicity, but also argues that dias-pora studies have neglected crucial questions of class and gender.39My own position is that it is mistaken to define ‘diaspora’ whollybased on an image of the Jewish phenomenon. However, there hasto be a powerful emotional bond to an actual or idealized home-land, distant from the new home. The key factors are a sense of ahistorical relationship with that place of perceived origin, and aninternational network of co-ethnics, or co-religionists. To posit asense of hostility in the place of the new home is also giving dom-inance to the ‘ideal Jewish type’, but a sense of difference, whichmay or may not include hostility, is a key factor. The need to recon-ceptualize the heritage (religious or secular) is common, but thatprocess can take many forms: mostly there is a universalizing of thetradition, but there may equally be a reassertion of ‘orthodoxy’.In whatever form the tradition is preserved, there is a commonpattern of the younger generation identifying their religion as a keyfeature of their identity.Two scholars assert that the Parsis do not constitute a diasporiccommunity. Their objections require immediate attention if thetitle of this book is to be thought to have any legitimacy. W. Safranwrote:The diaspora of the Parsis is in several respects comparable to thatof the Jews: its members have been held together by a common religionand they have engaged in commerce and free professions, have beenpioneers in industrial innovation and have performed various usefulservices to the ruling class. Like the Jews, the Parsis have been loyal tothe government. But unlike the Jews, they are not widely dispersed butconcentrated in a single area—the Bombay region of India. Moreoverthey have no myth of a return to their original homeland, Iran, whencethey migrated in the eighth century. The weakness of the Parsi ‘home-land’ consciousness can be attributed in part to the caste system of IndiaIntroduction2339‘Evaluating “Diaspora”: Beyond Ethnicity’,Sociology, 32 (3), 1998, pp. 557–80 atpp. 558 f."},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"and the relatively tolerant attitude of Hinduism, both of which made fora greater acceptance of social and ethnocultural segmentation, andmade Parsis feel less exceptional.40Similarly, Cohen writes of the Parsis:They are not so much a travelling nation . . . as a travelling religion.However, this aspect of Zoroastrianism also limits the extent to whichwe can call Parsees a diaspora: they do not seek to return to, or to recreatea homeland....In general I would argue that religions provide additional cement tobind a diasporic consciousness, but they do not constitute diasporas inand of themselves ...The myth and idealization of a homeland and areturn movement are also conspicuously absent in the case of worldreligions.’41The contention behind this book is that both of these judge-ments are mistaken. I trust that this study of Parsis in eleven coun-tries establishes that Safran is factually incorrect to say that theyhave only one base, the Bombay region. The argument of bothSafran and Cohen that Parsis do not constitute a diaspora becausethere is no wish to return to, or recreate, a homeland is equally fac-tually incorrect. As we shall see, Parsis, like Iranian Zoroastrians,have a strong concept of the homeland, which is why Parsis saythey are not Indians but Persians. Books about Iran, ancientIranian artefacts and Iranian symbols decorate all the Zoroastrianhomes I have lived in, and in recent years Zoroastrians from India,Pakistan, Australia, Britain, Canada and America have undertakenorganized religious tours of the homeland. It is not feasible in thecontemporary political situation in Iran for them to envisagea return to settle in the homeland, in view of the polices of theIslamic Republic which is in power. But in the 1970s when theShah was in power, many contemplated, and some actually did,return to Iran. While I was visiting India and Iran regularly in the1970s, numerous Parsis asked me whether I thought it was safe,and whether they should return to Iran. During the WorldZoroastrian Congress in Iran in 1996 Parsis and IranianZoroastrians alike visited the homeland and deeply appreciatedthe assurances of the Islamic leaders that they respectedIntroduction2440W.

Many of them in practice do not anticipate returningto Iran to live, just as countless Jews over the centuries drink to thetoast ‘next year in Jerusalem’, but neither in medieval times nor incontemporary America have most Jews envisaged returning to livein Israel. Similarly most Hindus living in the West, for all their attach-ment to the homeland and periodic visits to India, do not envisagemoving from London or Toronto to settle in India. The idealizationand powerful emotional attachment of diaspora Zoroastrians to thehomeland is encapsulated in a video made by a team of youngAmerican Zoroastrian professionals recording their pilgrimage toIran.43The video is appropriately named ‘In the Footsteps of ourForefathers’. This is but one example of many that demonstrate alove for Persia. Indeed, many second- and third-generation Parsisin America see Persia rather than India as their homeland.Cohen’s arguments about world religions also need to bequestioned. What is a ‘world religion’? The logical argument is thata world religion is one that is open to anyone in the world. In thatsense Zoroastrianism is not a world religion because of its attitudesto conversion, just as Judaism, Hinduism and Sikhism are notworld religions. If Judaism, Hinduism and Sikhism are worldreligions because they are found in countries around the world,then so is Zoroastrianism.44I also find it difficult to see Cohen’sreasons for stating that a religion cannot be a diaspora when thatreligion clearly involves an image of a religious homeland.Introduction2542There is an account of the Congress and its debates in Parsiana, July–Aug. 1996,pp. 58–71. Audiences were granted by IRI Leader Imam Seyyed Ali Khamenei andPresident Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani. This account, naturally from a Parsi perspective giventhe place where the account was published, emphasizes the Parsis’ Persian heritage. This wasreportedly recognized by the Iranian leaders. For example, Khameini referred to ‘Iran, theland of the divine Prophet Zarathushtra ...your land’ (op. cit. p. 68).43Produced by Tenaz H. Dubash, 2000. This has been shown at the MillenniumCongress in Houston, in a World Zoroastrian Organization function in 2002, and at acommunal function in Sydney, as well as in many homes. A similar point is made differ-ently in a video, ‘Paradise’, produced by two young Zoroastrians in British Columbia,Shajriar Shahriari and Shervin Shahriari, 1997, where they are transported back in timeand are taught by the Prophet and seek guidance from such major historical figures asCyrus the Great.44Vertovec argues that Hinduism is an exceptional case as a religion that is raciallybounded but still merits consideration as a diasporic phenomenon.The Hindu Diaspora,pp. 1 f.

There areseveral common themes in these lists. One important factor is theold country—where people come from, the nation and the ruralor urban setting; the extent and nature of links with the old coun-try, and contemporary events in the old country. A second featureis the nature of the migration—whether it was to escape oppres-sion or seek better educational and career opportunities, andwhether it was undertaken alone or as part of a family network.A third group of factors is to do with relations with the newcountry—perceptions of it, the experience of racism or of plural-ism and also the nature of ‘their’ community in the new land (forexample, whether there is a formal organization and a building oftheir own in which to meet). To these common factors my ownstudies added the nature and level of education, employment andIntroduction2645K.

She asks whatthe commonalities are between a north Indian, upper class,Oxbridge-educated university teacher and a Pakistani waiter orgrocer.48Various other studies have drawn attention to other factors insettlement patterns. One study by Naficy, which relates specificallyto patterns of Iranian settlement in the United States, is especiallyappropriate to this study and merits particular attention here. Inthe course of this book there are various references to the power-ful sense of Iranian Zoroastrians being the ‘real’ Iranians (or some-times Persians, to evoke the image of the ancient culture). Naficy’scomments on the preservation of Iranian-ness in America are par-ticularly relevant here. However, the points that he makes aboutIranians are, in my opinion, appropriate to other diaspora groupsand his work merits more attention than it has received. Naficystudied ‘Iranian nostalgia’ as evidenced by American-producedIranian television, music and videos.49The theme of his article isthe (re)creation of the image of Iran and of the experience ofexile. Naficy uses ‘exile’ to express the concept that the otherauthors cited would have termed ‘diaspora’. He writes: ‘The“glorious return,” the operative engine of actively maintainedexile must remain unrealized; in the words of Rumi, the exile mustroam and pant to return but never actually achieve it’ (p. 288).He continues later:However, this nostalgic past is itself ideological in that, as Said writes inOrientalism(p. 55), it has become an ‘imaginary geography,’ a constructioncreated by exilic narratives. But this construction is not hermetic, sincethe ‘real’ past threatens to reproduce itself as a lack or loss; it is againstIntroduction2747Clarke et al. added religion, which I did not separate as I was writing about a religiousgroup, and caste, which does not have a place in the Zoroastrian community unless one inter-prets their attitudes to intermarriage as a caste-like feature.48‘Evaluating “Diasporas” ’, pp. 570 f.49H.

(pp. 288 f.)He points out that musicians and artists are often opposed to thecurrent Islamic regime because it forbids music and the arts.Iranians appeal to symbolism that pre-dates the factions, and thiscan mean that they glance to the pre-Islamic past: ‘The past that[ Iranian] exile television has found suitable as its reference pointis chiefly the pre-Islamic past, in whose fetishes are encoded thevalues of Iranian antiquity, historicity, national chauvinism, patri-otism and superiority, and which are repeatedly circulated withinexile television’s political economy’ (p. 297).50Naficy argues that the boundaries of the group are largely sym-bolically constructed, and sometimes imperceptible to outsiders.The boundaries can be reconstructed by members of thecommunity itself and are maintained through the use and inter-pretation of symbols (p. 295). He emphasizes the importance ofrituals for heightening the consciousness of communal boundaries,which are particularly reinforced at times of celebration such asmarriage or festivals in the calendar. Such rituals, he continues,acquire particular prominence when boundaries are being blurred,undermined or weakened. He concludes with the perception ofthe past, and in particular the different constructions of that past,held by the exiles and those back in the old country: ‘there aredifferent versions of history: official versions and those held inpopular memory. At home [ Iran] the official history is promulgatedby mainline media; in Iranian exile, a kind of official history ispropagated by largely royalist producers and consumers’ (p. 299).Other scholars have also drawn attention to many themes thatcommonly recur in various diaspora groups.

A phrase several authors use is thatpeople in the diaspora are affected both ‘by their roots, and theirroutes [of migration]’. A number of scholars also rightly emphas-ize the pathways of globalization—the links between the diasporagroups, and not only with the old country.53This range of inter-action is facilitated by modern communications and ease oftravel, and also by transnational or multinational companies,which move both people and capital around the globe. Cohenpoints to the importance of what he terms ‘global cities’. Helists Tokyo, London and New York, to which, especially for thepurposes of this book, one might add Hong Kong and Toronto.Who migrates and why?Brah emphasizes a different dimension of diasporas. She writes:At the heart of the notion of diaspora is the image of a journey. Yet notevery journey can be understood as a diaspora. Diasporas are clearlynot the same as casual travel. Nor do they normatively refer to temporarysojourns. Paradoxically, diasporic journeys are essentially about settlingdown, about putting roots elsewhere...The question is not simplyaboutwho travels, but when,how, and under what circumstances[emphasis inthe original].54This raises a theme studied by relatively few scholars, but clearlyof importance, namely the difficulties faced in the process ofmigration, the complexity of the issues which lead people tomigrate.55Who is it that migrates?

But diasporas are also potentially the sites of hope andnew beginnings.’57So to her earlier question might be addedothers: who sees themselves as benefiting from the huge step ofmigration, what benefits do they anticipate and how do they fare?In the course of this book it will be important to consider the dif-ferent patterns of settlement of people who migrated for differentreasons, e.g. Iranian refugees after 1979, or young single peopletravelling for education, or elders joining their young families inthe diaspora.Political issues and diasporic communitiesIt is remarkable in the study of diasporas how little attentionhas been paid to comparative studies of immigration and racerelations laws and their impacts. Authors refer to them in theiraccounts of when, and sometimes why, migrations happened whenthey did. For example, in Britain in the 1960s, the South Asiansfeared that racist concerns about ‘this island race being swampedby immigrants’ would lead to the closing of doors on immigra-tion. Many men, therefore, brought their wives and families toBritain, with the result that the numbers of South Asians increasedsignificantly.58What has rarely, if ever, been attempted is a com-parative study of the impact of race and immigration laws onthe religions within western countries. The nearest attempt is byChristian Joppke, who studies first the immigration laws and theirmotives in the United States, Germany and Great Britain, and thenthe race relations laws and policies in those three countries.59His"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"study is fascinating, but it is not part of his brief to look at theimpact of these policies on the religious groups of those countries.60It would be interesting to see studies of, for example, the impacton religious groups of the German policy on guest workers, who(until the new millennium) could not become citizens, even if theirparents were born in Germany, compared with the French andAmerican policies of encouraging early acceptance of citizenship.There have been comparative studies of American, Canadian andAustralian policies, as we shall see in Chapters 8 and 9, but againthere has been little attention paid to the impact of these policies onthe respective religions. The comparisons are of a historical naturebecause of the interactions of the governments. The nearest studyof this kind is Nye’s work on the impact of planning laws on thebuilding of a Hindu temple in Britain, but again this is (reasonably)focused on a specific sequence of events and does not discuss theimpact of the policies on religion.61ConclusionThis book is aimed at two audiences: (a) those interested inZoroastrianism; it is the first book to consider the modern dia-spora, and it has been a cause of excitement to fly into a countryknowing that no one has written on this subject before; (b) thosescholars who engage in debate on diaspora communities, or onmigration, be they concerned with Religious Studies or not. I hopethe book has value as an attempt to compare the experiences andnetworks around the globe of one religious/ethnic minority. Inone sense, the Zoroastrians are a peg on to which is hung a widerdebate. The two dimensions of this book support each other.

Others were supporters andactivists within the Congress camp; indeed, Parsis were pioneersin the party’s foundation.

The final conclusion wasthat they could and should stand or fall by their merits and notseek any privileged status. How they fared in this new secularstate, with a large Hindu majority, is the subject of this chapter.But first it is important to look at the whole picture of nationalpatterns against which the Parsi situation has to be viewed.Independent IndiaNehruHaving resisted granting Independence for decades, the BritishGovernment eventually pushed the process through with consid-erable haste.2As ‘the tryst with destiny’, to use Nehru’s words,approached, Hindus fled from the prospect of Islamic Pakistan,and Muslims fled from what they perceived as Hindu India. Theresult was carnage, as extremists on both sides slew those whomthey had come to see as their enemies, in huge numbers.Thousands of refugees moved to the large cities such as Delhi andBombay, but these cities also suffered the loss of some importantMuslims and Hindus. These religious conflicts, before and afterIndependence, were major factors in Independent India’s empha-sis on secularism. Never again, it was urged, should there be suchreligious conflict. The first Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, per-sonally visited and intervened in situations where violence againstMuslims was threatened.

Yet remarkable developments took place.There was a determined drive for industrialization, somethingcontrary to Gandhi’s philosophy, resulting in a building and tech-nological expansion, the development of higher education andresearch centres, and progressive urbanization as people moved tothe cities for work. The use of higher-yield grains slowly easedthe worst famines and from the 1950s to the 1960s life expectancygrew from around 32 to over 50.

She inherited the mantle of the great man and his manyachievements, but also many problems: war with China in 1962,the Hindi crisis in 1965 (following the proclamation of Hindi asthe national language, bitterly opposed by the southern states),war with Pakistan in 1965 and problems in Kashmir.Mrs Gandhi’s political prominence lasted until her assassinationin 1984, but included periods of great turbulence, notably herproclamation of the Emergency in 1975, when the Allahabadcourt overturned her election, her defeat at the ensuing election in1977, but her return to power in 1980. She, too, faced war withPakistan in 1971 after north-east India had been overwhelmedwith refugees from the atrocities committed by West Pakistaniforces in East Pakistan (later Bangladesh) because of moves forIndependence. Most well known is her action in the GoldenTemple against Bhindranwala, a man she had ironically used tofoment divisions in the Punjab (1984). Her actions there arousedthe deepest anger among Sikhs around the world, not least inBritain and Canada, but also caused resentment in India and ledto her eventual assassination by two of her Sikh bodyguards. Innineteen years she changed much in Indian political life. Herinstinct was to centralize power in her own hands, and to this endshe sought to control state governors and assemblies and allowedmore influence to her entourage than to senior figures in herparty. She transformed the process of mass mobilization, effect-ively used by Mahatma Gandhi, to gain the support of the back-ward and deprived classes at election times, skilfully usingtelevision, film and poster images to project her own personality.She continued the policies of nationalization, but found herselfable to do little to deal with rising economic problems aggravatedby the costs incurred by the refugee problem, the Indo-Pakistanwar and the OPEC oil price rise. India has one of the mostdramatic population growth rates. Her son, Sanjay, allegedly withParsis in Post-Independence Bombay36"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"help from violent youth groups, sought to persuade, indeedenforce, sterilization, a policy which made not only him unpopu-lar but rebounded against his mother also. The Punjab crisisapart, however, undoubtedly her greatest difficulty was theEmergency (1975). Initially this resulted in fewer strikes, increasedindustrial production and therefore led to a healthier economy.But the political, and eventually personal, consequences wereconsiderable. Many of her erstwhile supporters left her side inpublic or quiet protest at the imprisonment of opponents and thesuspension of democracy. She had thought that the economicimprovement would carry her through the election that she calledat short notice in 1977 to disadvantage opposition parties whountil recently had been banned or imprisoned. She was wrong,and suffered years in opposition. She learned from this, at least tosome extent, and through intensive nationwide campaigningreturned to power in 1980. She proved to have a mastery ofpopulist campaigning.Following her assassination, her older son, Rajiv, hitherto anairline pilot not a politician, assumed what was being presented asalmost dynastic rule. He won a landslide victory in the 1984 elec-tion, with some 80% of the seats in Parliament. Initially, he movedto ease state control and to limit import controls, also to liberalizelicensing and to encourage private enterprise and investment. Fora year the economy appeared to flourish, and technology in par-ticular developed, but thereafter his entourage turned him awayfrom the economic free path, and interest groups manœuvred toturn the policies in their individual favour. When Rajiv was assas-sinated in 1991 by a Tamil suicide bomber, not only did theGandhi dynasty come to an end, but the national political scenefragmented. The regions attempted to reverse the centralizingpolicies of the Gandhis. Although the Congress Party remainedthe largest single national party, its influence was strong in only afew areas. Regional parties and concerns became the order of theday. Politicians showed little party loyalty but moved where theirinterests were best served. Factionalism, not party loyalty, was thenorm. Thus from the early 1990s, it is difficult to write aboutnational trends; it becomes essential to focus on the individualstates and regions. For the purposes of this book, that means theState of Maharashtra and specifically the city of Bombay, laterrenamed Mumbai. There are, however, two trends that affect theParsis in Post-Independence Bombay37"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"whole country: the danger of nuclear war with Pakistan from2001, and the rising violence between Hindus and Muslims,especially in Gujarat. As India now has more Muslims in itspopulation than there are in Pakistan, there is a threat of bothinternational and civil war.Religion in Independent IndiaIt is necessary first to comment briefly on the place of religion inIndependent India. As noted above, the experience of Partitionand the establishment of a Muslim state in Pakistan provokedIndian leaders, notably Nehru, to stress the secular nature ofIndia. Secularism has different shades of meaning in differentcontexts. In the study of western secularization the emphasis is onthe separation of Church and State, and the decreasing influenceof religion on political, legal and national institutional and socialaffairs. In India the emphasis is rather on the concern for freedomof expression for all religions, and their security within legal andstate matters. The aim was that there should not simply be aHindu India opposed to a Muslim Pakistan. From the 1970s, andincreasingly in the 1980s and 1990s, many Hindus in much of thecountry, but especially in the urban areas, argued that in a democ-racy the concerns of the majority, the Hindus, should predominate.In order to mobilize the mass vote, Hindu symbols werefrequently used in public. Although the Swatantra (a free enter-prise party) and Janata (an alignment of more left-wing groupswhich came together during the Emergency) parties continued,the increasing trend in the 1990s was to political fragmentationand the growth of the Hindu nationalist groups, notably the BJP,formed in 1980 out of the old Bharatiya Jan Sangh, an upgradeof the pre-Independence Hindu Mahasabha. Although the BJPcalls for Hindu rights and uses Hindu symbols, it is in some waysa secular group whose goal is the economic and military develop-ment (including nuclear weapons) of India. It is concerned to easecentralist controls and to develop a wider free-market economy. Invarious parts of India it has become the dominant party, obtainingover a hundred parliamentary seats in the process and increasingthe 3% share of the vote achieved by its prototype to 20% in1991. It therefore not only attracts the mass Hindu vote, it also gains the support of the middle class, economists and manyParsis in Post-Independence Bombay38"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"industrialists; in 1998 it became the ruling party in government.The mass appeal has resulted in violence in many urban areaswhere the BJP is strongest. These nationalist concerns were high-lighted by the events surrounding the demolition of the mosqueat Ayodhya, which had allegedly been built on a site sacred toHindus, as it was believed to be the birthplace of Lord Ram. Thepolice did little to prevent the protest march or the demolition ofthe masjid in 1992, the culmination of a campaign started in1984. This excited Hindu passions not only nationally, but alsothroughout the diaspora. Hindutva, ‘Hinduness’, was the cause ofthe day. There was violence in many cities as Hindus attackedMuslims; over a thousand died in Mumbai alone. Again, thereappears to have been little police attempt to restrain the mobs.Increasingly, many are questioning the desirability of secularismas a basis for state policy when the country is so predominantly ofone religion. Voices are raised protesting at the ‘pampering of theMuslims’, and the violence between Sikhs and Hindus, especiallyin the 1980s, means that although attacks have been directedpredominantly against Muslims, they are not the only focus ofreligious opposition. The strength of Hindu religious feeling,many felt, had all too often been overlooked. It was after all aHindu, a Brahmin, who assassinated Gandhi in 1947 followingIndependence, for what was considered to be his weakness in theface of Muslim demands. What, unwittingly, stimulated the out-burst of Hindutva was the screening on television in 1987–8 of thegreat Hindu epic the Ramayana. Crowds in villages and urban slumsalike watched the many episodes. Alongside this was the heroiza-tion, almost the deification, of famous film stars. Appearing as adeity in film was an aid to political advancement for some actors.5India at the dawn of the new millenniumDemocracy appears strong in India. Its elections are the largest inthe world; the voter participation rate has grown consistently andsubstantially since Independence. Indian democracy was a strongenough force to survive the Emergency. And yet in many ways it runs counter to much Indian tradition. It is, for example, neithera natural ally of the caste system, nor part of the royal powerParsis in Post-Independence Bombay395Van der Veer,Religious Nationalism, pp. 154–61 and esp. 172–8."},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"traditional in ancient India and preserved into modern times withthe princely states. Some of the old ways have been quietly pre-served, indeed are strengthening. They can be seen, for example,in the role of courtly advisers, whose loyalty is to the person inpower, not to party principle; in the vertical loyalties of patronage;in rewards for favours, less charitably described as bribes; and inthe strength of a dynasty. Power in India commonly derives eitherfrom associations, such as caste associations, or from leader–follower relations. Religious conflict between Hindus andMuslims, and with Pakistan, has brought to the fore the threat,indeed in 2002 the reality, of communal bloodshed and the fearof nuclear war.Following Nehru’s vision, India has evolved as an industrialnation, first seeking to meet its own needs and then developing itsexport trade. There has also been a growth, in the hands of estab-lished families—especially in Calcutta and Bombay—of smallindustries, not least in the electronic goods market. The result hasbeen a booming share market, leading to investment and thegrowth of a number of industrial cities. But despite the growth ofproduction of indigenous goods, India remained a ‘poor’ countryat the end of the millennium, with a per capita growth incomestill of only 1.3%; and with extensive undernourishment. Yet—despite the fiscal crises of the 1980s—it has the lowest externaldebt as a percentage of gross national product of all developingcountries, apart from China. In the south, notably Bangalore, thecomputer industry has developed considerably. While exports arehelped by the low value of the rupee, import costs are extremelyhigh. The unequal distribution of wealth, the extent of impover-ishment of urban sprawls (despite the big city lights publicized onthe television screen), the decline of Russia—a major financialbacker first under Nehru and then under Mrs Gandhi—all meanthat the demands by the growing population for their slice of thenational cake became more strident, not least from the studentsand the young, and from the masses whose needs have not beenmet by the politicians campaigning for democracy. Since the endof the Nehru–Gandhi dynasty, the shape of politics has changed,with an increasing fractionalization of Indian politics, that hasled to unstable coalition government. Widespread corruptionhas undermined the authority of many institutions and violencecontinues in local politics.Parsis in Post-Independence Bombay40"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"Post-Independence BombayThe growth of BombayBombay, like many other Indian cities, both experienced a waveof refugees at the time of Partition and lost some importantMuslims, as noted above. As droughts and poor harvests afflictedthe Gujarat countryside in the 1950s, so economic refugeesmigrated to Bombay, a trend which has continued unremittinglyinto the new millennium, with the result that the population ofBombay has increased by some 700% in that time. Television andcinema screen images of the glittering lights of the metropolishave continued to entice new arrivals. But as Bombay city is anisland, it has been unable to grow significantly, despite some landreclamation. The size of the island increased by 1,000 acres, orless than 10%, in thirty years.6In percentage terms the period ofgreatest growth was 1941–51, when the population increased by56%, though the increase in actual figures was at its greatest inthe period 1981–91. Only 6% of the 950,000 migrants in the1940s came from Pakistan; most were economic migrants.7Therehave been two substantive studies of migration to Bombay,by Zachariah and Bulsara.8Their basic theme is that in that periodthe majority (approximately 70%) of Bombay’s population wasborn outside the city; that most migrants came with little educa-tion; and that there was a heavy preponderance of males (160males per 100 females in 1961, levelling to 136 per 100 in 19819).Most migrants (73%), even more than in proportion to the over-all populations, were Hindus, with 13% Muslims (15% of the1961 Bombay population). An unknown, but substantial, propor-tion of migrants had little choice but to live on the streets and inthe most temporary of accommodation (water pipes on the road-side, impermanent structures with sacking or plastic sheeting).10Parsis in Post-Independence Bombay416M.

Despite the returners, there is little doubt that hutments,shacks and pavement dwellers increased significantly in the 1990s.Such concentrations of seriously underprivileged people naturallyprovide fertile areas for discontent, as politicians proclaim democ-racy but do little about the disparities. These areas are one sourceof recruitment for the Hindu nationalist cause, though in Bombaythe situation is more complex, as will be seen below. Although theproportion of Bombay’s population who were born in GreaterBombay increased from 25% in 1941 to 37% in 1961, that stillleaves two-thirds of the population born outside the extendedlimits of the city.11Inevitably there have been shifts of populationtrends within Bombay. As numbers have increased, so the denselypopulated areas have spread into the northern suburbs, especiallyto the north-west. But the main business and commercial areasremain in the south, so that the density of commuting traffic iswithout equal in the western world. In central Bombay (Ward C),the density of population reaches 1,598 persons per acre.12Thenewer industries have been located in the north. Future plans pro-pose expansion across the Thana Creek on the mainland, butthere has been little movement so far.Bombay politicsDespite these population changes there are ways in whichBombay is cut off, metaphorically as well as literally, as an islandindependent of India, largely free from government bureaucracy.Its primacy as India’s commercial capital, banking centre andpremier port is only marginally eroded. With the growth of indus-try, especially engineering and chemicals, in northern Bombay, thecity remains in many ways the engine of the Indian economy.Studies of employment patterns indicate that commerce andindustry are expanding and the prominence of the professions hasdeclined somewhat.

There were no Jews according to hisfigures, and only 1% of the city’s population was Sikh.15Bombay has evolved politically. The first major developmentcame in 1960 when Bombay Presidency was bifurcated intoGujarat and Maharashtra, with Bombay eventually being linkednot with Gujarat but with Maharashtra. The change was part ofthe national move to redefine state boundaries along linguisticlines. Bombay therefore moved from its historical link withGujarati to Hindi, as the national language post-Independence,and to Marathi, the regional language, after 1960. The languagechange reflected and affected local political ties and concerns;Marathi rulers favoured Marathis in employment, education, etc.In national political terms, Mumbai remains one of the majorcentres where the Congress Party is the largest party16but the ShivSena, related to the BJP, has significantly increased its influence.The Shiv Sena, ‘the army of Shiva’ was started in the 1960s as ananti-immigrant movement. Its central platform was thatMaharashtrians should receive preference in employment andeducation. The original target of its attacks were Tamils fromSouth India, mocked as ‘lungiwallas’, and depicted as crim-inals, gamblers, illicit liquor dealers, pimps, goondas, andCommunists.’17The concern was that the Tamils were bettereducated in English and were taking a high proportion of middlemanagement jobs. But from the 1980s its main target has been theMuslims, notably, but not only, through the pogroms in 1992against Muslims following the Ayodhya incident.

The Shiv Sena doesnot share Gandhi’s and Nehru’s vision of a secular India, butinstead has the view of a government concerned with the needs ofthe majority in its area. In the 1998 elections it came to power inMumbai.In short, since Independence, Bombay has grown hugely inpopulation, but minimally in geographical terms. The result hasbeen increasing density of population and traffic problems of anorder that it is difficult for anyone who has not visited the city toappreciate. The problems of travel have been exacerbated by thedeclining inner city residential population as people moved to thesuburbs, especially in 1971–81, so that an increasing number ofpeople commute into the city. Industry and commerce has grownsignificantly, but so also has the proportion of the poor and slumdwellers. In that environment, radical politics have flourished, asMaharashtrians fear that they suffer in the face of the wave ofmigrants who take jobs and other opportunities from them.Bombay is India’s most cosmopolitan city, but the Maharashtriansseek to assert their ‘ownership’ of the city: street names are alteredto reflect their traditions, and the city’s name has been changedback to the ancient one of Mumbai.Parsis after PartitionParsi demographyBefore considering the history of Parsis in Independent India andin Bombay/Mumbai, it will be helpful first to look at the changingdemographic features of the community. Unfortunately, thisprocess is complicated by the fact that the decadel censuses did notask the same questions, so some features can only be discussed withreference to specific decades. The 1961 census yielded most infor-mation about Parsis because the community’s apex body, theBombay Parsi Punchayet, paid for a special study, whereas the1991 census provided only minimal data, merely populationfigures in each state. There were, however, various demographicstudies undertaken by Parsis or outside academics and these canbe utilized to provide a fuller, if still somewhat fragmented, picture.Parsis in Post-Independence Bombay44"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"Parsi numbers in IndiaIn broad terms it can be seen from Table 2.1 that the overall Parsipopulation has declined steadily since 1941, with a dramaticdecline of 20% from 1971 to 1981. There was a steady migrationfrom Gujarat to Bombay. There was reported to be a marginaltrend to move out from Bombay to Pune in the 1990s, as peoplecommuted rather than pay the high accommodation costs ofBombay, and to the computer software industries aroundBangalore, but no published figures establish this rumour. The1991 census indicates an increase of 4,752, reversing the earliertrend, with an increase in Bombay of 3,741. Various explana-tions have been advanced for this. One argument has been thatthe decline has bottomed out and the numbers can now beexpected to remain constant. This view ignores not only themonthly record of deaths exceeding births published in thewidely read magazine,Parsiana, but also the age structure of thecommunity recorded in all studies. A different explanation for the1991 increase is that publicity given to the declining numbers,within the community, has resulted in Parsis (who may previouslyhave recorded themselves simply as Indians, Gujaratis, etc.) beingmore careful to record their ethnic identity. A third explanationis that census data in a country as vast as India cannot be veryprecise and that too much significance should not be attached toone set of figures. First, however, it is necessary to look at the pre-1990 trends.Parsis in GujaratThe move from Gujarat to Bombay was marked throughout thetwentieth century.

Of familiesstudied by Shah, 55% then turned to agriculture as their main orsole occupation, with 70% earning part of their income fromagriculture. They sought to farm the land they had tenanted out.But new land tenancy legislation, introduced in 1950, restrictedthe income a landlord could derive from his tenant. It also deter-mined a sequence of five categories of person to whom he couldsell, in order of priority, and severely restricted his right to claimback the land for his own use. Traditional agricultural land hold-ings therefore had their profitability undermined. These problemswere further compounded by a series of droughts and poorharvests in four out of the seven years between 1947 and 1954. Tocompound the problem, transport was nationalized and a numberof Parsis lost this livelihood. The result was real poverty. Of thefamilies surveyed by Shah, 15% had no source of income, and76% fell below the average necessary for a family of four. Mistryin 1967 found similar conditions in his survey of Parsis in a nearbypart of rural Gujarat. The young and able left Gujarat to seekwork in Bombay, and the villages became the homes of the elderly,the disabled, the poorly educated and women who could not joina partner in Bombay. The communities in the very region whichhad made Parsis powerful and wealthy in the eighteenth and nine-teenth centuries became a declining, impoverished and ageingrelic: an area for charitable giving, but also it has to be said anobject of patronizing attitudes, as many of the sophisticatedBombayites labelled them ‘the junglis’.

The editorstresses that these figures cannot be precise, for they depend heav-ily on reports from hospitals and families for much of the infor-mation, not least births and marriages. Nevertheless, they indicatea general pattern of the substantial excess of deaths over birthseach year; a figure confirmed by the Bombay Parsi Punchayet’sown statistics (Table 2.2).23In 1947 Desai analysed the birth, marriage and death rates inthe community. He argued that fertility in the Parsi communitywas on the decline, that as marriages were being delayed oravoided, so deaths would exceed births and the community woulddiminish in numerical terms. His arguments appeared to many tobe too apocalyptic and were contra-indicated by the fact that in1941–51 the Parsi population reached a new peak.

The figuresin Table 2.4 show literacy rates among the wider Bombay popu-lation, and among Parsis, both male and female. There are twopoints meriting comment. In each age group for both genders theParsis have a higher literacy rate than does the wider Bombaypopulation; Parsi women in particular have a higher literacy thanthe wider female population, indeed in most groups higher thanthat of Parsi males. These figures are highly distinctive for Indiaas a whole, and the implications will be discussed below. One ofthe consequences is that more Parsi women in the age bracket15–34 (i.e. the normal childbearing age in India), 29.06%, aregainfully employed, compared with only 12.54% of the widerBombay female population. Whereas the number of births in theBombay Parsi community totalled 1,015 in 1952, it was down to870 in 1961. The number of deaths had risen from 904 to 971 in theParsis in Post-Independence Bombay49TABLE2.3.Children aged 0–4 per 1,000 females in Bombay, 1961Children of females Children ofaged 15–44married femalesWider Bombay population554735Bombay Parsis294537TABLE2.4.Literacy rates among the Bombay population and Parsis (%)All ages0–910–1415–1920\u0001Bombay males65.1027.3987.6582.6070.91Bombay females48.8125.3286.6171.8850.33Parsi males89.8942.1791.0392.5096.54Parsi females90.4546.4399.1899.3295.03"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"same period. In short, the Parsi population of Bombay, in contrastto the wider population in that city, was an ageing communitywith a regressive population trend. The women are well educated,and are delaying marriage, at least in part, to use that education.The consequence is an excess of deaths over births, which threat-ens a diminishing population.The Parsis have not funded another specific census analysis,but the apex body, the Bombay Parsi Punchayet, commissioneda non-Parsi researcher, Prof. (Mrs) Malini Karkal, of theInternational Institute for Population Sciences in Bombay toundertake a study of the Parsi population of Greater Bombay in1982 (published 1984). She undertook a random survey of 2,000Parsi households from the seven constituencies of the city inwhich Parsis are concentrated. In broad terms, Karkal found thatby using various measures such as physical size of dwelling,luxuries owned, number of people per dwelling and income,Parsis generally had a better standard of living than the widerBombay population. She also found that the trends identifiedin the 1961 census had continued, specifically the age compositionof the community, marriage patterns and fertility. In terms ofage, whereas in the 1971 census (the latest figures available whenKarkal wrote) 32.58% of the Greater Bombay population wasunder the age of 15, and only 2% over the age of 65, amongParsis Karkal found only 12.14% under the age of 15 and 19.16%over the age of 65. She points out that the United Nations definesa population as aged if more than 7% are over the age of 65. TheParsi population over 65 had grown from 14.10% since 1971 to20.3%, a remarkable increase in little over a decade. (In 1911, theover-65 age group represented only 4.21% of the Bombay Parsipopulation.) The median age had increased from 37.02 in the1961 survey to 40.27 in Karkal’s survey. The ageing tendency hadtherefore significantly increased. The young dependency ratiodeclined from 37.21 to 22.92 in the same period. The communitytherefore continued ageing, and not reproducing itself.Karkal found that Parsi educational achievements continued tobe significant. Only 7% of males and females under the age of40 were illiterate, whereas 35.08% of men and 37.27% of womenunder the age of 40 were graduates (postgraduate figures forthe same age group are 8.93% for men and 7.61% for women).These figures have implications for employment patterns. The maleParsis in Post-Independence Bombay50"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"employment ratios of Parsi men and those for urban male employ-ment nationally24are roughly similar; the difference lies in the fig-ures for women. Whereas only 12.17% of Indian urban women arein gainful employment, 71.78% of Parsi women aged 25–9 are soemployed. The figures for the types of employment for all agegroups are complex.25In the present context, therefore, it clarifiesthe central issue to focus on the employment patterns of males andfemales aged 25–9, that is, the age after graduation, when child-bearing might be thought to be most likely (Table 2.5).The point here is that Parsi women tend to enter more senioremployment than do women from the wider population and arenot seriously disadvantaged compared with Parsi males duringtheir twenties, that is, in the age range where most Bombaywomen are having children. The rate of Parsi women’s participa-tion in employment is substantially higher (by almost 400%) thanis the rate of women in the wider Bombay population. Of thefamilies interviewed, 44.80% of males and 37.98% of womenwere never married. The mean age at marriage Karkal foundto be 29.36; late marriages among females, she discovered, hadParsis in Post-Independence Bombay5124Karkal makes the point that employment patterns are different in rural areas wherewomen follow agricultural pursuits, and therefore have a higher proportion in work thanin urban areas (Karkal,Survey, p. 69).25Ibid., pp. 74–8.TABLE2.5.Employment patterns among males and females aged 25–29 (% general Bombay and Parsi populations)Occupational categoryGeneral BombayParsi populationpopulationMalesFemalesMalesFemalesProfession/technical5.3320.9017.8021.14Admin./Exec./managerial3.931.0022.4420.58Clerical14.1220.9318.2021.61Sales14.267.4519.0128.81Transport48.3224.878.473.27Production2.101.6111.144.58Sports/recreation10.8322.411.460.92Fishermen etc.1.110.83——Total100100100100Participation rate57.537.6857.4528.77"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"increased by nearly 50% from 1901. Both these figures contrastgreatly with those for wider Bombay, where marriage is almostuniversal and takes place at a much younger age. In her studies ofthe never-married, Karkal found ( pp. 89–91) that it was predom-inantly the graduate women, in contrast to the less well educated,who were putting off marriage. When interviewed, the never-marrieds most commonly (96%) considered that relationshipswith in-laws were crucial in the success or failure of a marriage.When women marry, Karkal found, they typically had smallfamilies: the mean number of pregnancies for all Parsi women wasonly 1.95; the mean number of live births was 1.68 ( pp. 106–7).The trends to late marriage, or no marriage, and the decliningbirth rate, especially among the well educated, were also con-firmed by Billimoria’s later study.26Singh and Gowrie surveyed 6,596 households and a populationof 20,423 in baugs, colonies, and independent households inforty-five other areas of Greater Bombay. Their findings confirmthe continuing trend identified in previous studies. Whereas inIndia generally there are 5.5 persons per household, the averagefor Parsis was 3 persons. They found that 38.7% were graduatesand 11% had studied up to Masters level. Forty per cent of menand 30% of Parsi women remain unmarried throughout theirlives. The average age at marriage for those who do wed is 30.6for men, 26.8 for women. On average Parsi women have 1.54children and over 12% remain childless. Whereas in the widerIndian population 35% of people are under 15, among Parsis thepercentage is 10.4, and in contrast to only 5% of people in thewider population being over the age 65, in the Parsis they repres-ent 23.8%. The community is, therefore, continuing to agedramatically. As far as occupations are concerned, they found that34.4% are in service, 6.3% in business, 12.6% are students, 17%housewives and 25% live on pensions and savings. There is clearlya problem not only with declining numbers, but also in the main-tenance of the population both now and in the future. Unlike pre-vious surveys, Singh and Gowrie’s survey collected information onreligion: 70% described themselves as religious, 29% not very reli-gious and only 1% not religious at all; 95% said that they prayeddaily at home, 15% also visited the fire temple daily and 83% saidParsis in Post-Independence Bombay5226H.

Slightly more respondents thoughtthat the future of the community in relation to other Indiangroups was insecure rather than secure (36%–34%); 28% thoughtthat the community faced extinction.Communal demographic awarenessThe actual statistics are only one side of the issue: the other is theextent to which they are known and appreciated in the community.Successive writers, Parsi and non-Parsi, have highlighted thetrends in books, articles and magazines in a way which has con-fronted virtually all Bombay Parsis.27The fact that Parsianahasregularly carried figures for births and deaths, where the latterconsistently outnumber the former, keeps the issue at the forefrontin many discussions. The editor of that magazine, Jehangir Patel,not by nature a pessimist, wrote in 1985: ‘We cannot reverse thetrend towards extinction. No miracle can save the community. Buta change in attitude could help us better cope with the inevitable.’Similarly, in an editorial on the thirtieth anniversary of the found-ing of the journal, Patel focused his attention in the first part ofthe piece on the implication for the diverse institutions of theinevitable decline of the Indian Parsi population.28In a paperbased on a lecture at Harvard on religious problems facing thecommunity, the High Priest, Dastur Dr H. D. K. Mirza, high-lighted the issue of being ‘a dwindling and an ageing community’.29Parsis in Post-Independence Bombay5327P.

The subject was also covered in various papers at World Congresses,e.g., Desai 1964 (‘Statistics of World Zoroastrians with Special Reference to IndianZoroastrians) and Karkal 1985 (‘The Dying Community’). The subject of declining num-bers is covered in several other Parsi publications, e.g. the Orthodox Jame Jamshed, originallya daily, now a weekly, and the more reforming Bombay Samachar. Although these publicationssell more copies in Bombay than Parsiana, the latter has a more global circulation and henceits prominence in the above, for it may be assumed to influence Zoroastrians in the diaspora.The BPP Review of the excess of deaths over births was, for example, reproduced in theAustralian (Sydney) newsletter Manashni, vol. 2, issue 3, May–July 2001.

They informed thejournalists that there was a waiting list of 7,000, with some peoplewaiting for twenty years and living in single-room accommodation.With the housing available, they estimated that they could meet theneeds of only 700 people over the next five years. To deal withthe problem they needed 7 crores, but they had only Rs 61 lakhs.30The radical newspaper Bombay Samachardrew attention to the factthat not only did deaths continue to exceed the number of births,but also the gap was growing, so that whereas in 1971 there were343 more deaths than births, the excess in 1981 was 419.31In theSeptember 1985 issue of the Newsletterof the Federation ofZoroastrian Anjumans of India (explained below, hereafter FED)the front-page issue was the stark findings of the 1981 Indiancensus, showing a 20% decline in Parsi numbers. The abovedemographic data is, therefore, not a question of obscure statist-ical analysis, but a prominent element in Parsi consciousness anddebate.32How it affects debates on social and religious issues willbe discussed below. After this brief look at the broad demographictrends, it is now appropriate to consider the place of Parsis inIndependent India.Parsis in Independent IndiaThe national perspectiveDespite some of the Parsi voices in the Independence movement,the broad mass of Parsis throughout the nineteenth, and muchof the twentieth centuries, have been pro-British. They consideredthat they had flourished in the Empire economically, educationally,politically and socially. Many believed that there was a broad setof common values.33The president of the BPP, Sir ShapoorjiB.

Yet the speech (translated in full in Appendix 1) has ahesitant tone, saying that the Parsis have no reason to doubt thepromise that there will be no persecution, and emphasizing thevirtues of English statesmanship, culture and civilization. The restof this chapter is concerned with tracing the outcome of thatIndependence for Parsis in Bombay.Popular Parsi tradition has it that the community has declinednot only numerically but also in terms of influence in the courseof the twentieth century. An initial consideration of the place ofParsis in Independent India would not support that. Parsis haveoccupied the post of head of each branch of the armed forcessince 1947: Aspi Engineer, Air Chief Marshal, 1960; Jal Cursetji,Naval Chief of Staff, 1976; Field Marshal Sam Manekshaw, Chiefof the Army Staff from 1969 and decorated for his success inleading the Indian army in the 1971 conflict with Pakistan.34Parsis in Indian politicsThere have also been prominent Parsis in politics. Chronologicallythe first influential Parsi in Independent Indian politics was FerozeGandhi (1912–60). He was active in the Congress Party in the1930s and through his ties with the Nehru family knew MahatmaGandhi, who said of the young Feroze: ‘If I could get seven boyslike Feroze to work for me, I will get Swaraj in seven days.’35In 1935he studied Political Science, Economics and Journalism at theLondon School of Economics (LSE) and there a relationship devel-oped with Indira Nehru (then studying at Oxford). They becameengaged in 1937, and married in 1942. Their eldest son, Rajiv, wasborn in 1944 and Sanjay in 1946. In 1952 Feroze was elected to theNational Assembly, where it is said that he was something of athorn in the flesh of his father-in-law, Nehru, for his pursuit of cor-ruption, which led to the conviction of a leading industrialist andParsis in Post-Independence Bombay5534P.

The Gandhis separated butdid not divorce, and Feroze died in 1960. Parsis commonly say thatalthough Mrs Gandhi saw her sons as Hindus, technically they wereParsis. Rajiv in particular is said to have been like his father. Rightlyor wrongly, a number of Parsi leaders believed that Mrs Gandhihad a particular affection and respect for the Parsi community.Certainly, whenever she visited Bombay she made personal callson her Parsi relatives,36and several Parsi leaders have told me inprivate that they personally had direct access to her and obtainedher support in such matters as disputed land claims in Bombay.When she was contemplating introducing an Adoption Bill in 1982she received a deputation of Parsi priests and granted their petitionto be exempted from the proposed legislation.37Both she and Rajivvisited the Parsi temple in Delhi on festive occasions,38and therewere condolence meetings following their assassinations,39althoughthese have been held for many public figures, including Britishmonarchs. The Federation of Parsi Zoroastrian Anjumans of Indiasent Rajiv condolence letters on his mother’s assassination.40Inprivate, many Parsis have commented to me that technically RajivGandhi was a Parsi, being the offspring of a male Parsi, thoughunder his mother’s influence his religion was Hindu. Others havesaid that of the two sons, he was much more like his father. Thesignificant point behind such comments in this context is not somuch whether they are accurate, but that they indicate that Parsisdid not feel politically impotent, or marginalized.41Parsis in Post-Independence Bombay5836SeeParsiana, Apr. 1984, pp. 1–5, an article headed ‘Indira Gandhi “One of Us” ’,quoting her speech at a Delhi Anjuman meeting, where she said: ‘I have a soft spot in myheart for Parsis; otherwise I would not have gone to the extent of marrying one.’ Of herlate husband she said: ‘He was a good representative of your community—nay, mycommunity.’ She went on to say ‘Our community is a very small one.’ The visit, and herspeech, was also reported in the national newspapers the Daily(2 Apr.) and Mid-day(3 Apr.).37Parsiana, June 1982, p. 15.38Parsiana, Supplement, Apr. 1984, pp. 1–5 and for Rajiv,Parsiana, Oct. 1989, p. 7.

He held various seniorpositions: Mayor of Bombay, 1943–4; member of the IndianLegislative Assembly 1945–7 (nominated by his former antagonistSardar Patel, after Mahatma Gandhi had effected a reconcilia-tion); member of the Constituent Assembly, 1947–8; Member ofParliament and Leader of the Opposition 1949–52 and 1957–70.He also served as Indian Ambassador in Brazil from 1948 to 1949.He described himself (in private conversation)43as a naturalopposition person, a position he undertook vocally at the time ofthe Emergency, though he was never imprisoned.Sir Homi Mody (1881–1969) was originally a businessman, andwas involved in the First Round Table Conference in London in1930 as a representative of Indian Commerce.44He joined theViceroy’s Executive Council in 1941 and was given the Supplyportfolio, but he resigned in 1942 during one of Gandhi’s fasts todeath, this one to protest at the imprisonment of Congress leaders.He took various official positions, including being a member ofthe Minorities Commission, and then became Governor of UttarPradesh. Like Masani, Modi was a member of the SwatantraParty. His speeches in the Central Assembly in the 1930s had notmet with Congress agreement as he worked with the IndependentParty under Jinnah, but it was under personal pressure fromNehru and Patel that Mody accepted the governorship. That,however, did not inhibit the capitalist Modi (he had senior posi-tions at Tatas and the Central Bank of India and was president ofthe Employers’ Federation of India) from protesting personallyand forcefully at Nehru’s programme of nationalization. He wasalso prominent in the opposition to making Bombay part ofMaharashtra, on the grounds that Maharashtrians comprised lessthan 50% of the population.Nani Palkhivala (1920–2002) was another prominent politicalfigure whose early links with Congress became strained.

Palkhivala made his basic rep-utation as a tax lawyer; he was a director of several Tata compa-nies, a member of the Law Commission, and an ambassador tothe USA. For several years he gave prompt responses to the Indianannual budget, not in learned bodies, but in Bombay’s hugeBrabourne stadium to audiences of 70,000 and more. Although apassionate crusader for the Indian constitution and advocate ofthe enormous achievements of democracy in the country, his ownfear, expressed in private conversation, was that corruption hasreached such a level that the main hope for Parsis in the future liesoverseas. A cross-section of his political and community lecturesand articles illustrates his remarkable wide-ranging vision, acute-ness of mind and willingness to criticize the highest authorities inmore candid terms than one would expect from someone whoserved as the country’s ambassador in perhaps the most importantembassy in his nation’s politics.45Homi Taleyarkhan (d. 1998) served on the Bombay MunicipalCouncil for four years after Independence and then held variouscabinet posts under successive Chief Ministers in MaharashtraState politics, including the post of Chief Whip for the CongressParty. Mrs Gandhi made him the first Governor of the politicallysensitive new state of Sikkim, and he then held the post of ambas-sador to Libya for a double term of six years, during which timehe significantly improved Indian–Libyan relations. He often func-tioned as spokesman for the national Government on importantmatters, for example the Indo-Pakistan War. He served as a seniormember of the National Minorities Commission until its work wasended in Maharashtra by Shiv Sena.46Whereas Mody and Masaniwere long-standing critics of the Congress Party, and Palkhivalaleft it, Taleyarkhan remained to the last a member, an allegiance heaffirmed by wearing the Congress cap on public occasions.These political differences highlight a characteristic feature ofParsi political involvement, namely that they are not aligned withany one political grouping.

They argued, in private conversation, that theywere too small and insignificant to be a target of political attack,unlike Muslims. On the one hand they were also accepted asbeing politically neutral on balance and as committed workers forthe overall Indian cause.This point is reinforced by a brief consideration of Parsis elected to the various parliamentary establishments. Since IndianIndependence there have been five Parsi Members of the Lower(elected) House in Delhi: Feroze Gandhi, Congress Party in UttarPradesh; Minoo Masani, for the Swatantra Party in Assam/Gujarat; Piloo Mody, also for the Swatantra Party in Gujarat;Noshir Bharucha, for the Praja (People’s) Socialist Party inMaharashtra; Homi Daji for Madhya Pradesh, related to theCommunist Party of India. There have also been three members of the Upper House (nominated by the President orthe Regional Assemblies): Prof. Ardeshir Wadia, nominated by thePresident; Mrs Roda Mistry, nominated by the Congress Party inAndhra Pradesh; and Rusi Karanjia.

A similar Parsi function was held at one of the AtashBahrams, and by Parsis in eight other towns.53When the PrimeMinister called for donations to the defence fund at the time of theIndo-China War, various Parsi firms made substantial donations,including Rs 4,000,000 from the Tatas, and Rs 500,000 from theGodrejs.54The text relating the Parsi migration from Iran to India,dating from 1600 CE, the Kisseh-i Sanjan, depicts the journey as partof Zoroastrian destiny, as undertaken on the advice of a wiseastrologer priest; that is, it was written in the stars. It also refers toprayers for deliverance at sea from a life-threatening storm, and asa result of these prayers the Parsis came to land safely in India. TheParsi settlement in India was therefore seen as an answer toprayer.55A similar sentiment is still expressed by many Parsis; forexample, a letter to the editor published in Parsiana( July 1989, p. 3)reads: ‘It’s a blessing of Ahura Mazda that, of all nations, welanded in India when we were being persecuted in Iran...we havebecome an inseparable part of Indian society.’ My own subjectiveimpression is that when I first began visiting Bombay in the early1970s, there was still a leaning back, especially among the oldergeneration, to the days of the British Raj, although there was alsoa strong loyalty to India. However, at the turn of the millennium,I found the community to be clearly and unequivocally India-focused. There is some debate on what their place in Indiashould be.

That remained the majority view until the 1990s,but as communalism grows and Maratis tend to favour Maratisand Gujaratis favour Gujaratis, so Parsis feel they are beingexcluded. One example of this is found in entry to higher educa-tion. Because of reserved places for backward and other classes insuch popular subjects as Medicine and Engineering, those groupsare gaining university places with marks of around 50%, but Parsishaving no reserved places, have to gain in excess of 90% to winentrance.It should also be emphasized that Parsis not only believe thatthey have been blessed by being in India; they are also convincedthat they have contributed much to India. It can be invidious togive a list of great achievers, because of the arbitrary nature ofomissions. But in order to underline the Parsi conviction, it maybe worth highlighting a few, other than the military and politicalfigures already noted, who have been important figures in Indianlife. They have produced some distinguished scientists and scholars;perhaps the most outstanding was Homi Babha, the pioneer ofIndia’s atomic energy programme.57In economic and industrialterms, the largest Indian firm is that of the Tatas. Their concernsrange from steel production (the town of Jamshedpur is namedafter the founder of India’s steel industry, Jamshed Tata), to themanufacture of cars, lorries and buses, various engineering firms,tea, clothing, soaps, investments, luxury hotels, electricity andpower generation companies, chemicals and oil processing.Until nationalization, they owned Air India, another example ofhow socialist policies affected Parsis, although they were notdirectly targeted.58It is one of the world’s largest firms. SouthAsia’s largest private firm is that of the Godrejs, still owned byParsis in Post-Independence Bombay6356S. F.

Bhabha, Bombay, 1994.58There has, surprisingly, been no balanced study of the Tata empire. The life of thepioneer has been chronicled by J. N. Harris (Jamsetji Nusserwanji Tata: A Chronicle of his Life,2nd ed., Bombay, 1958), and in a more recent less critical study by B. Sh. Saklatvala andK. Khosla (Jamsetji Tata, Delhi, 1970). The broadest ranging study of the firm is R. M. Lala(The Creation of Wealth: A Tata Story, Bombay, 1981). There is also a study of the Sir DorabjiTata Trust, one of many established by the family, R.

It also includes a large nature reserve.60Most issues ofParsianainclude pieces on Parsi artists anddancers who have succeeded. The major international conductorZubin Mehta, who will appear in the chapters on Britain and theUSA, remains a hero in Bombay also, one hugely welcomed therewhenever he visits India. There have been several leading Parsilawyers, but in the 1990s perhaps the most prominent was SoliSorabjee, prosecutor for the International War Crimes Trials fromthe former Yugoslavia, and Attorney General of India. TehmtanAndhyarujina was also made Solicitor General of India.61Theachievements of Parsis have been honoured and publicized bythe Parsi Punchayet, the Federation of Indian Zoroastrians andthe World Zoroastrian Organization, and in numerous books.62For example, in 2002 the BPP honoured three Parsis, FieldMarshal Sam Manekshaw, Sorabjee and Andhyarujina.63In short,the Parsis have continued to play a role in Independent India outof proportion to their numbers, though the prominence may notbe as great as at the end of the nineteenth century. They continueto feel reasonably safe in India, they are committed to the coun-try, and they justifiably believe that they make substantial contri-butions to it.Parsis in Bombay/Mumbai Post-IndependenceThe dramatic increase in the population of Bombay has resultedin the movement and concentration of different groups, includingthe Parsis. Their dispersion around the city is due in part to theParsis in Post-Independence Bombay6459B. K. Karanjia,Godrej: A Hundred Years, Delhi, 1997 (2 vols.).60See B. K.

They have beenaffected by the changing political ties. Whereas in British Indiatheir languages were English and Gujarati, after Independencefirst Hindi and then Marathi became official languages for polit-ical purposes. English remains a nationally recognized language,but aspects of Parsi traditions associated with Gujarati have beenweakened, as it becomes the third language for young people.Since Independence, government funding has not been given forcommunity- or religious-specific schools. The Parsi schools, there-fore, had to become cosmopolitan and inevitably lost something oftheir distinctive character. But a trend was already evident forwell-to-do Parsis to send their children to Catholic or missionaryschools because of their disciplinary and educational records.Inevitably, the broad trends noted above for Bombay havehad an impact upon Parsis. Bombay has long been growing asa centre for Indian Parsis, but this developed further afterIndependence, as the rural economy suffered from prohibitionand tenancy legislation. The increasing importance of commercialand industrial activities, based in the city, along with the educa-tional institutions for such professions such as law and medicine,also drew people to Bombay for work. The growing publicsupport for Shiv Sena has not yet had widespread impact on theParsis. A Parsi couple, Phiroze and Mehroo Medhora, were killedin the 1992 riots. This was because they happened to live in abuilding that was set on fire in an attack on some Muslims whoalso lived there, not because they were Parsis. There are individ-ual stories of Parsis being surrounded by mobs who mistook themfor Muslims, but when their identity was confirmed they werereleased unharmed. Parsi homes and colonies were threatened byviolent Hindu mobs searching for Muslims who might be givenshelter. There was sufficient unease for the BPP to announceprovisions for sheltering Parsis whose homes were destroyed. ThePunchayet and such leaders as J. R. D. Tata and Nani Palkhivalaactively pressed for protection at the very highest level. But theseincidents once again resulted in cosmopolitan philanthropic char-ity, as individuals and charities donated funds and goods throughParsis in Post-Independence Bombay6564Kosambi,Bombay in Transition, p. 136."},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"various organizations for all the afflicted.65The favours shown toMaharashtrians can, of course, in the long term work to theeducational and career disadvantage of Parsis. But the peoplewith whom I discussed this simply observed that Parsis had longlearned to succeed by being seen to be better than most at whatthey did, and that as a small pro-India minority they were not seenas a threat, and therefore not as a target, by aggressive Hindugroups. There have been occasional fears that the BombayGovernment might question the acceptability of much Parsi-owned land, particularly the extensive grounds around the Towersof Silence at Doongerwadi, in the centre of crowded Bombay.Periodic alarmist newspaper stories alleging the discovery of partsof bodies in nearby streets, said to have been carried by the crows,have sometimes highlighted these fears.66At the time of writingthere has been no such direct threat. Parsi charity in Bombayremains active, and is not only community-targeted. In 1953, ofthe 5,003 charitable trusts registered in Bombay, 935 were Parsi,719 Muslim and only 59 Christian or Jewish.67Just one modernillustration of cosmopolitan charitable work is the Parsi-fundedfree ambulance service maintained for the use of all communities.68The role of Parsis in Maharashtra State politics and the celebra-tions of the coming into existence of Maharashtra State havealready been noted. The contributions of the great nationwideindustries of Tatas and Godrejs are, of course, Bombay based andthey too should be born in mind when considering the local scene.Parsis have held important local positions since Independence:the Commissioner for Bombay, Kanga,69and three Parsis havebeen Vice-Chancellor of Bombay University (Masani, Wadia andDr (Mrs) Mehroo Bengalee).Parsi InstitutionsThere is a plethora of Parsi institutional bodies, almost all basedin Bombay but many having an impact beyond the city and intothe diaspora.

Parsi communities large and small around Indiahave their own governing bodies, Punchayets or Anjumans. Sincethe 1970s they have joined together in the Federation of ParsiZoroastrian Anjumans of India. Although its concerns are nation-wide, and each Association sends a representative, the president ofthe Federation is always the president of the Bombay ParsiPunchayet and therefore its history can properly be discussedunder the heading of Bombay. The Punchayet and the Federationare social bodies which, where possible, avoid involvement inreligious matters, although that is not always possible. There arebodies concerned with community (not regional or national) poli-tics. One body was originally established in the 1980s to introduceelectoral reform, namely the Committee for Electoral Rights(CER). This immediately triggered an opposite group, theOrthodox Committee for United Zoroastrians (CUZ). Thesebodies quickly became involved in religious disputes. Less reli-giously contentious was the Community Development Institute,which reports on social concerns such as housing. The IranianZoroastrian Anjuman similarly has little religious involvement andis concerned primarily with issues of a social nature involvingIranian Zoroastrians, both the descendants of nineteenth-centuryrefugees and more recent arrivals. It is, however, difficult amongBombay Parsis to separate social, political and religious concerns.For example, the Association for Intermarried Zoroastrians(AIMZ) grew out of the controversy after Roxan Shah’s death,discussed below. It quickly became involved in a number ofreligious questions, notably the initiation of the children of Parsiwomen married out of the community.There are many specifically religious bodies. There are twopriestly seminaries, the Athornan Madressa at Dadar Colony andthe Cama Madressa at Andheri. These are the only institutionsin the world dedicated to the training of Zoroastrian priests, andtherefore they are where young Zoroastrians in the diaspora whowish to become priests sometimes go, if not for their whole educa-tion, at least for some of the preparations for the priestly initiation.There are various specifically religious groups: some concernedwith preserving traditional practice, such as the Jashan Committee,others with a more educational role, such as Zoroastrian StudiesParsis in Post-Independence Bombay67"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"and the Young Collegians Zoroastrian Association ( YCZA, dis-cussed further below). Other groups are associated with particularteachings, notably the occult Ilm-i Khshnoom. Another group, theAthravan Trust, is concerned with the welfare and educationof priests, a concern of other bodies also. There are yet moreorganizations, or Trusts, concerned with the running of hospitals,temples, libraries, schools, housing colonies and other socialconcerns. Before looking in some detail at major bodies, it is firstimportant to review the sources for an account of these groups.Bombay Parsi newspapers and magazinesOne feature of the Parsi community, as noted above, is its high lit-eracy rates. It is not, therefore, surprising that there are numerousnewspapers and magazines in the community. Although it is notappropriate here to give the history of each, it is important to notetheir focus, concerns and biases, because of their extensive use inthe footnotes of this chapter. The oldest is the Bombay Samachar(Asia’s oldest printed newspaper), founded in 1822. It is read bydiverse Gujarati-reading communities: for example, it is readby some Muslims. In the twentieth century its Parsi coveragehas generally had a Reforming perspective but this changed in thelate 1990s to an Orthodox perspective. It is commonly critical notonly of the establishment (notably the BPP) but also of thetraditional or Orthodox point of view. It was the only Bombaynewspaper which commonly supported the World ZoroastrianOrganization, a world body started in Britain, and also generallyassociated with some Liberal causes (see Chapter 10). The BombaySamachar (BS)inclines to convey the views of diasporaZoroastrians more sympathetically than most Bombay newspapers.Ideologically opposed to the BSis the Jame Jamshed(Jame), startedin 1832. Whereas the Samacharis for various communities, theJameis specifically for Parsis. It includes matrimonial columns,parents reporting the successes of their children, columns onhealth, investments and legal matters. It also has a social dimen-sion with pages on the cinema and sport. Its comic cartoon stripis especially popular. Although sometimes critical of the BPP, it isthe mouthpiece of more traditional writers. Some of its editorsand contributors have been leading Orthodox speakers; twowhose names occur in the following pages are its editor (until hisdeath), Adi Murzban, and Adi Doctor. In 1994 Dastur KotwalParsis in Post-Independence Bombay68"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"began a question and answer column. The Jamewas a daily, but itsfalling circulation reduced it to a weekly. It is mainly in Gujarati, buthas English columns and is widely read by the older generation,some of whom send copies to their families in the diaspora. Itwould, however, be a mistake to categorize these newspapers toonarrowly. Although it is a common supporter of reforming causes,theSamacharhas sometimes taken unexpected stances. For example,the Orthodox Dastur Mirza has written for it, not only single arti-cles, but even a series, and on one occasion he attacked an Orthodoxpublication in the Samachar’s columns.70Similarly, although it isgenerally reasonable to describe the Jameas Orthodox, the label‘Orthodox’ covers many shades of opinion, and in the columns oftheJamethere have been attacks by some Orthodox writers on otherOrthodox teachers.71As the Samacharbecame Orthodox, so theJamebecame more liberal, for example in supporting WZO.There has been a succession of short lived newslettersand newspapers representing the Orthodox point of view, anddifferent perspectives within the broad band of Orthodoxy. Thoserepresenting views on current community matters are the ParseeVoice(started by a chairman of the BPP, Boman-Behram) and DeenParast(still publishing at the time of writing).72The main source quoted in this book is Parsiana. It dates fromthe 1960s, but was transformed by its new (and still serving) ownerand editor, Jehangir Patel, in the early 1970s. Patel had studiedand worked in journalism in America before taking over Parsiana,transforming it from a small, cyclostyled, little-read paper intoa substantial, professionally produced magazine. It is sometimesconsidered Reformist by Orthodox writers, partly because ofPatel’s role in the early stages of the CER’s campaign for therights of intermarried Parsi women, discussed elsewhere. Butgenerally its tone seeks to be neutral. The letters column includescomments from all sides of the religious debates; it includes histor-ical and secular items. In this context it is an appropriate primarysource for this period because it is widely read in the diaspora asParsis in Post-Independence Bombay6970See for example the following issues: 28 Jan. 1993; on 10 Nov. 1991 he wrote a seriesof articles on Sasanian Zoroastrianism, and on 27 Mar. pp. 2–8, he attacked Deen Parastregarding that magazine’s coverage of the Tata uthumnadiscussed below.71e.g. in the mid-1990s there were some very critical pieces by and about Nariman,Peer and Dadrawala.72There are also newsletters/magazines issued by various religious groups, which willbe discussed in the comments on their groups."},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"well as in Bombay, unlike the BSandJame.73It regularly containsnews about the diaspora groups and has articles by them.Furthermore, it is kept by some western university libraries and istherefore easier for non-Zoroastrian readers to access.Bombay Parsi social institutionsThe Bombay Parsi PunchayetThe starting point for a discussion of Parsi social institutions has tobe the Bombay Parsi Punchayet (BPP). The body goes back to theeighteenth century.74Originally it was a paternalistic semi-governingbody. In the twentieth century it became predominantly a charit-able body. However, because of the considerable extent of thatcharity—it is Bombay’s biggest landlord—it continues to have someauthority and despite frequent press criticism within the commun-ity, the BPP, its trustees, and especially its chairman, have substan-tial standing in the community. After Independence a conferenceof all major Bombay Parsi Trusts was convened by the BPP todeal with post-war reconstruction, and a committee structure wasevolved to oversee agriculture, industry, education and health,including workshops for the disabled and orphans.75Over the nextfifty years the emphasis of its work inevitably changed. By 1961 it isestimated that it administered the funds of over 1,000 endowments,a number which has grown with donations both large and small. In1981 it published details of a fourteen-fold increase in donations forconstruction of charitable buildings (mostly housing) from 1971 to1980.76The 1981 (unpublished) figures show an increase in diversecharities, from education to religious purposes, from Rs 663,919in 1970 to Rs 1,197,264 in 1981.77Parsis in Post-Independence Bombay7073The following are the circulation figures, kindly supplied by Patel, in Jan. 1998:Maharashtra 1,795 (mostly Bombay); rest of India 471 (including 131 in Gujarat); USA247; Canada 81; Pakistan 42; Australia 38; United Arab Emirates 16; Hong Kong 4; Misc.92; total non Indian circulation 646. In practice it is read more widely than these figuressuggest. In some centres, e.g. Hong Kong, where Parsis meet regularly, the few copiesgoing there are passed around most people. Some copies, and cuttings, ofJameare sent byMumbai families to relatives in the diaspora.74For a historical overview and bibliography see J.

Generally the policiesand actions of the trustees were more transparent from the 1980s,when quarterly then bi-monthly reports, were published, but theseceased in the 1990s. By the 1990s the primary focus of its activitieswas housing, to try to deal with the problem of the diminishingpopulation. Public and press alike argued that Parsis were delay-ing marriage and having small families because of the difficultiesand costs associated with housing in Bombay. In 1998 the BPPwas responsible for eighteen colonies incorporating 240 buildingshousing 3,967 tenants, with some 154 shops included in thosecolonies. The largest of the recent colonies is Godrej Baug, begunin the 1980s, most of its sixteen buildings being erected in the1990s. In order to counter allegations of corruption in the alloca-tion of this subsidized accommodation, guidelines of eligibilitywere published and revised early in the 1990s. To apply, peoplehave to establish that they do not already own a property and thattheir income is below a certain level. Emergency cases apart (e.g.where existing accommodation has collapsed), priority is given toengaged couples and married people still of childbearing age.Credit is also given to people who have been on the waiting list along time. The allocation of properties, and other housing pol-icies, remains controversial and is a subject of frequent press specu-lation.78One major subject of debate is whether the BPP shouldsell some properties in order to generate income to invest in morebuilding, or whether the trustees should allocate all properties intheir possession in order to reduce the waiting list of 2,000 appli-cants. The BPP has also constructed nine buildings encompassing423 flats for sale to Parsis. In the 1990s the policy has beendoubted on two additional grounds. A BPP-commissioned surveyquestioned whether the availability of accommodation actuallyresulted in earlier marriages and more births.79Further, it hasbeen suggested that as the community numbers are decreasing,the need for subsidized housing will inevitably decrease.80Thereare of course further problems: once tenants have moved in, it isParsis in Post-Independence Bombay7178See e.g. the report of the then newly elected trustee, Dinshaw Tamboly,Parsiana,Oct. 1997, p. 12.79P.

In the1990s new building declined because of a shortage of capital. Inits place an incentive scheme was established for larger families,with the BPP promising to meet the costs of a third child81. Oneproblem implied in the above, but important to detail, is thatdespite the public perception of a hugely wealthy Punchayetsitting on vast fortunes, there is in fact a relative paucity of avail-able funds. This is partly because endowed funds are commonlytied to a specific purpose that it is difficult to change without costlycourt procedures. Further, current social changes in India meanthat the wage bill for the same size of workforce has increaseddramatically, thus reducing funds for other activities. Furthermore,many community buildings were constructed decades ago, and thecosts of renovation are mounting.Housing is not the only concern of the Punchayet. It also runsa temple, rest homes and sanatoria, a hostel, schools, boys’ andgirls’ homes, a college of commerce and an employment bureau.The number of students assisted with education costs increased inthe decade 1971–81 from 375 to 522 per annum. In that period,maintenance help for the poor increased from 326 persons to 519and the number of people assisted with interest free loansincreased from 32 to 78. Further, in that decade, the annual wagebill of the industrial institute ( providing jobs for people who wouldotherwise be unemployed) increased by 400%.82There are also efforts to develop social networks for youngParsis. A marriage bureau has been organized, but the ‘successrate’ is not high. Much more successful has been a summer campprogramme. Approximately two hundred young Parsis approach-ing school leaving age assemble in Bombay and have an extensiveprogramme on employment, higher education opportunities,personal development and advice on sexual matters,83as well asenjoying purely social functions.

The anecdotal evidence is that this workis much more successful than the bureau. There is also a socialworker who assesses needy cases and advises the Punchayet onwho needs what help. The effort to halt the declining populationis not, therefore, restricted just to housing.The work of the BPP is huge, especially in view of the micro-scopic size of the community. Perhaps inevitably, the disputes overits conduct of affairs, and the elections for trusteeship are mattersof public debate and concern. A system of election, rather thanappointment, became the subject of a law case in 1906, andthe cumbersome method of election lasted into the period ofIndependent India. That system and the question of eligibility tovote have been contentious issues in the 1980s and 1990s. Theelection system introduced in the early years of the twentiethcentury was unwieldy, with four different categories of personscomprising different constituencies in an electoral college, orAnjuman committee, which in turn elected the seven trustees,the most senior one of whom became chairman. The intentionhad been to give greater influence to substantial benefactors andgraduates.84This was changed in 1987 to a simpler system withonly two constituencies—donors of substantial benefactions to theBPP, and registered voters—the two registers electing an equalnumber of people to the electoral college. Eventually the newelectoral scheme had to be a matter for the courts.85The major confrontation has been over the voting rights ofParsi women married out of the community. Unlike out-marriedmales, they had been excluded from voting. In a test case in theBombay High Court in 1906 it was stated that among Parsisdescent was through the father, so that the offspring of a maleParsi could be initiated, but not the offspring of a female Parsiwho had married out.86Women were assumed to acquire thereligion of their husband and thereby to have renounced theirParsi heritage and rights. In 1981 a group of women challengedParsis in Post-Independence Bombay7384See the protest letter which was an important trigger for change, published inParsiana, Supplement, July 1978, 2.6, pp. 1 f., also Supplement, June 1980, 3.2, pp. 1–3, aletter originally published in the conservative newspaper, the Jame Jamshed. The BPP haddecided in March 1978 to form a committee to advise on electoral reform.

The case was more complex thanthis single issue, for the BPP was also criticized for the timing ofthe elections, but the significant issue for the longer term was therights of intermarried Parsi women. The Committee for ElectoralRights (CER) was set up to campaign on this, and other, issues. Inreaction, the then president of the BPP, Boman-Behram and anOrthodox trustee, Dr Nellie Noble, formed a counter group, theCommittee of United Zoroastrians (CUZ), with a magazine asits mouthpiece, the Parsee Voice. This represented a group ofOrthodox religious interests, the occult, or Khshnoomic bodies,the Jashan Committee and others discussed below. Some of theircandidates for the electoral college were prominent religiousfigures, for example Dastur Dr Firoze Kotwal, Dr Meher MasterMoos, Adi Doctor, Dr Homi Dhalla, Ervad Aibara (all writerswhose work will be discussed below), as well as several seniorpriests and the principal of the madressa. CER was supported bysome leading lawyers, Palkhivala for example, and Jehangir Patel,the editor ofParsiana.87The issue became a question ofOrthodoxy versus Reform, and assumed apocalyptic religiousdimensions. So, for example, one newspaper advertisement for theCUZ read:Before you make up your mind which group to vote for—CER orCUZ—please ask yourself the following questions:1. Do I want my community to disintegrate into a race of half-casteZoroastrians through mixed marriage?2. Do I want Parsi women who have married out of the communityto become Trustees of the Parsi Punchayet?3. Ultimately, do I want my Community to die out and our religion todisappear?If your answer to all these three questions is an emphatic ‘No’—thenyou know whom to vote for—CUZ of course.88Parsis in Post-Independence Bombay7487SeeParsianaSupplement, Feb. 1981, 3.8, pp. 1–12.88Jame, 28 Feb. 1981.

In 1972 the various Punchayetsand Anjumans in India formed an over-arching body, theFederation of Parsi Zoroastrian Anjumans of India. TheFederation was discussed over an eleven-year period, 1960–71,and it started functioning in 1972–3. But in 1978 the BPP left theFederation, partly owing to personality clashes between theBombay and the Delhi presidents, but also because of a religiousissue, when Delhi accepted non-Zoroastrian spouses as members.When Bombay left, so did several other important groups: Surat,Poona, Madras and Baroda, for example.102In 1978 the BPPvoted to return, and so did the others. In 1985 there was again athreat that the BPP would withdraw from the Federation, becausethey feared being outvoted at meetings, despite representing moreZoroastrians than all the other Anjumans combined. The BPPTrustees were split 4 : 3 on the issue, but Naoroji Godrej proposedthe compromise that reasserted the autonomy of all Anjumans.103Consequently, the Federation now represents fifty Anjumans andPunchayets, embracing approximately 90% of India’s Parsipopulation.104The BPP chairman is ex officioFederation chairman,and the vice-chairs are the representatives of Delhi and Calcutta.Parsis in Post-Independence Bombay77100Parsiana, Oct. 1997, p. 12.

Generally speaking, the Associations included are thosewhich have an impact on diaspora groups. One that merits inclu-sion, although it is not active in the western diaspora, is theIranian Zoroastrian Anjuman. One result of Maneckji LimjiHataria’s crusading work in Iran on behalf of his Iranian co-religionists in the mid-nineteenth century108was that from theend of that century small family groups of Zoroastrians left Iranand sought security in India. They mostly settled in Bombay, oftenstaying in a dharamsalafor a time, with their children livingin orphanages in order to receive education.109Some first-generation Iranian migrants had difficulties with the English lan-guage when they settled in Bombay, and this gave them problemsin employment: some felt the well-to-do Parsis treated them in apatronizing manner. A number later went into restaurant or tea-house businesses. Some also went into law, medicine and industry.A founder and the first president of the Anjuman, for example,was Dinshaw Jijibhoy Irani, a solicitor. He and other Anjumanlawyers sought to protect the landholding rights of Zoroastrians inIran. A number of Iranian Zoroastrians, together with somewealthy Parsi backers, began to work for improved conditions forpoor Zoroastrians, and to this end formed the Iranian ZoroastrianAnjuman in 1918. A priority has been building and helping to runschools and orphanages in Iran, especially in the cities from whichthe migrants came, Yazd and Kerman. A pioneering figure wasP. D. Marker, who opened an orphanage for Zoroastrian boys anda high school in Yazd in 1923. The Anjuman has also sought tospread knowledge of Iranian Zoroastrianism among Parsis and toencourage knowledge of the religion back in Iran.

A number of IranianZoroastrians based in Bombay developed business interests in Iranduring the 1960s and 1970s when the nation’s wealth and indus-trial drive was growing. In the western diaspora they have onoccasions played an important role in mediating between theParsis and the Iranian Zoroastrians.A parallel body to the Anjuman, the Iran League, was startedin the early twentieth century, to strengthen the bonds betweenParsis and the Zoroastrians of Iran in cultural and commercialactivities. Some of the leading founding figures in the Leaguewere Parsis, notably Hormusji Cowasji Adenwalla, who, it will beseen below (Chapter 6), was a Parsi influential in the East Africanas well as the Bombay Parsi communities.

He later became a member of the IranianParliament, the Majlis, and a member of the Senate, a man whoseintegrity earned him the respect and confidence of the Shah, andwhose family are now in the western diaspora.111Bombay Parsi SocietyThe familyThe family is the basic unit in most societies, although what are seenas the boundaries of families may change. Among Parsis in general,but especially in India, the extended family system is strong.112Commonly, the first theme in a conversation between Parsis meetingfor the first time is to explore any possible family connections. Thesearch is rarely in vain! The knowledge of the family tree, includingwhat westerners would consider distant cousins, is extensive.Cramped and expensive housing conditions mean that genera-tions often live together. Many Parsis of my acquaintance, includ-ing individuals who have studied overseas, live with their parents,even when married and with a family of their own. In part this isdue to the cost of housing in Bombay, but the purpose is not onlyfor the young to care for the elderly, but also for the elders to carefor their grandchildren while parents are at work. Many youngerBombay Parsis do not see this as ideal and couples often seeka home of their own, however attached they may be to their par-ents. Nevertheless, my subjective impression based on numerousresearch visits over thirty years, and staying with various families,is that bonds are close, not only between families withinBombay, but also with those who have migrated overseas. Familyvalues, loyalties and respect seem to me to be strong. Respect for,and the care of, the elders is assumed by most to be a clear respon-sibility, and one that is rarely neglected. Divorces do happen, andcompared with some Indian societies the level is high, but in com-parison with western groups it is low.

These grounds include cruelty (mental or physi-cal), mutual consent, adultery, unsoundness of mind, non-con-summation of the marriage, impotency, bigamy, desertion, orconversion to another religion. The changes were proposed by theFederation, considered and supported by the MinoritiesCommission, approved by Parliament and the President.114TheBPP runs a marriage counselling service, which seeks to aidreconciliation, and where that is not feasible, then legal andcounselling services can be brought in.115In the 1980s and 1990s the genre of Parsi English novels hasgrown considerably and in many ways can provide a useful insightinto the community.116The two major novelists, Sidhwa and Mistry,live in the USA and Canada respectively, but most of the othersParsis in Post-Independence Bombay82113Report taken from Parsi Chief Matrimonial Court, Bombay, registrar, published inParsiana, Nov. 1992, p. 9.114The amendments are discussed in issues ofParsiana: Jan. 1987, pp. 20 f.; May 1988,p. 9; Apr. 1992, p. 3; May 1992, pp. 32 f.; June 1992, pp. 32 f.; July 1992, pp. 33 f; Aug.1992, pp. 106–9; Sept. 1992, pp. 31 f.

There is no single pattern of Parsi family relations, andmany different types are portrayed in the novels. If there is onecommon theme, it is that family relationships are depicted as lov-ing ones, however that love is expressed. Abuse and brutality arerarely portrayed. Although there are cases of abuse in the Parsicommunity, my own observations suggest that, as the novelistsimply, such cases are rare. Three themes in the novels, docu-mented elsewhere in this chapter by figures, are first, the assump-tion that young Parsi women are generally highly educated andcareer-motivated; they are socially free to mix with people of theirown age, male as well as female, from within and from without thecommunity. Second, almost all the novels refer to intermarriage,a question that greatly concerns the community, as will be seen inthe next section. Third, the authors bring out vividly the extent towhich Parsis are typically very class-conscious.Most of the novels describe young boys trying out sex withother young boys, though adult homosexuality is rarely described.The exception is the semi-autobiographical novel of FirdausKanga,Trying to Grow, written in Bombay and about Bombay.117Kanga has suffered throughout his life from brittle bone disease,which has confined him to a wheelchair for life. He is also openlygay. Both of these dimensions of his own life are true of the cen-tral character of his book. The book is written with humour, noself-pity, and candour.

For example, the Orthodox Toronto-based Parsi, PervinMistry, wrote in a Bombay paper ‘All revealed religions havea commandment against gay behaviour...It is totally againstNature, against the Will and Plan of God to be gay.’119In private,some Zoroastrians have talked to me about being too afraid ofcommunal censure to acknowledge openly that they are gay. Thisis true of many societies, but my subjective impression is thatthis is particularly so among Zoroastrians, where marriage isa duty. It is not simply a duty for the laity; it is also required forpriests. A High Priest, for example, cannot perform some of thehigher ceremonies until he is married and becomes, inZoroastrian thought, a full person. However, although marriage isa duty, and increased family size a necessity for communal survivalmany individuals who have chosen to remain single are notjudged harshly.The youthThere are various schemes in Mumbai which are aimed at keepingthe youth within the community by giving them an opportunityto meet socially. It is hoped that through meeting with fellowZoroastrians, more will find a marriage partner within thecommunity. The BPP youth summer groups have already beenmentioned. It is thought that these meetings are more effectivethan the marriage bureau run by the Punchayet. The Federationruns an annual ‘Youth Meet’ as well as having a youth page in itsnewsletter. One of the oldest groups, The Young Collegians’Zoroastrian Association (YCZA) was founded in 1952 byProf. Nadir Modi and Prof. Khurshed Sheriar. At a celebratorygolden jubilee function in 2002, Modi estimated that as therehas been an average of fifty functions per year for fifty years, theAssociation had organized some 2,500 functions. YCZA providesscholarships and medical aid, as well as organizing social events.120Books on such careers as medicine, science and commerce aredonated by alumni and given to current students.

The awareness of the needfor more housing has already been alluded to in the discussion ofBPP policy. Hormazdyar S. Dalal in papers researched for, andpublished by, the Zoroastrian Community Development has docu-mented the extent of poverty among Parsis living in sub-standardaccommodation, desperate for BPP housing. In two reports in1984 he described cases of Parsis being compelled by poverty tolive in red-light areas and frightened to go out; of multiple sharingof toilets in chawls; of several generations living in a single room;of buildings which were not safe in monsoons; and the case of afamily of three generations, including a pregnant mother, whowere homeless because of the collapse of their home and forced tolive in a transit camp. He has also detailed the extensive problemsof the decaying fabric of temples, sanatoria and guesthouses(dharamsalas). Because so many of the buildings were erected duringthe period of affluence in the late nineteenth century, they are nowin desperate need of renovation. He estimated that this applied to60% of temples and gave a description of fifteen temples that werein urgent need of repair. The sanatoria in Bombay, he reported,tended not to be used for their original purpose of convalescenceafter illness, but rather as transit camps for homeless Parsis whohave lost their accommodation and are awaiting BPP or otherassistance. One of the three sanatoria in the city, he reported, wasin a very distressing condition. Some of those in the more ruralareas of India are in an even worse state.121Although the buildingof flats increased substantially in the late 1980s and 1990s,Federation and Parsianareports indicate that the physical decay ofParsi structures continues.

But there has beenno such development in Mumbai. In the metropolis there are threehospitals which the Parsis helped to build: the Sir JamsetjeeJeejeebhoy Hospital (a major university teaching hospital), theMasina Hospital in Byculla and the Petit Parsee General Hospitalon Cumballa Hill.122Each of these has a Parsi ward; in the Masinaand Parsee General these are for chronic cases.

The point here isthat the phenomenon of Parsi poverty is not something restricted torural Gujarat but is nowadays found also in the great metropolis.126The acute housing problems identified in the 1980s had easedsomewhat at the end of the millennium, partly because of newhousing developments, and partly because with the decreasingnumbers the demand had fallen. But undoubtedly poverty remains.Medical mattersAnother common theme in Parsi discussions is medical problems.There is a concern that in-breeding (10% of Parsi marriages areto first cousins) may result in some disorders. The only substantialwork done on this was published in 1973, but the issue is alludedto in other publications.127Karkal, in her 1984 study of Parsis,suggested that infertility might be a problem in the community.She stresses that arguments based on people’s answers to ques-tions on the use of contraceptives are not necessarily reliable, butshe concludes that the evidence suggests that even when Parsiwomen do not use contraceptives, the number of births remainslow. In part this may be due to the late age of marriage, butwomen in their thirties do have children and it is noticeable howfew children are conceived in Parsi families. A popular, butunproven, allegation made by some Parsis is that such in-breedingmay increase the levels of psychiatric disorders. Certain forms ofcancer, some believe, are more prevalent among the Parsis. Butthe only clearly established genetic problem faced by the Parsis isa deficiency of the enzyme G6PD, which may lead to jaundice inthe new-born, and can adversely affect the red blood cell countunder the influence of some drugs (e.g. aspirin, quinine or heavydoses of vitamin C).128These medical concerns are raised in thedebates on intermarriage discussed below.Parsi decline?A common theme in Parsi discourse is that the community is lesssuccessful and less dynamic than it was in the nineteenth centuryParsis in Post-Independence Bombay87126See also the article by A.

This is reflected,for example, in the opening statement of the initial publicdocument of the Zoroastrian Community Development Institute,founded on 8 July 1978:The gradual slide towards lower, middle class, in fact the increasingincidence of poverty in the community; the financial difficulties of manyworthy communal institutions; the disposals of fine Parsee properties,both public and private; the reducing adherence of Parsees to religiousrequirements, traditions and customs; the decreasing knowledge, aware-ness and pride in Zoroastrian ideals and ethics; the weakening bondsbetween Zoroastrian and Zoroastrian; the increasing scarcity of qualifiedpriests, and diminution of our very population; the creeping influenceof other religions with their Gods and Saints; the slow break-up of Parseefamily life—all these were painful reminders that communal healthwas failing, and that imaginative, modern, well-planned, communityprogrammes are badly needed.In personal conversation, and in the letter columns of the popu-lar press, such as the Jame129and the Parsee Voice, the view is oftenexpressed that nowadays young Parsi men, in contrast to youngParsi women, are less achievement-orientated, less hard working,more spoilt, and prefer a safe office job rather than the risks, andpotential success, of entrepreneurship. This theme occurs alsoin some of the contemporary Parsi novels. The anthropologistTanya Luhrmann argued that in the days of the Raj, Parsisfollowed the British role model and presented themselves, incontrast to their image of Indians in general, as manly, dynamic,powerful, strong, progressive, heroic, whereas in IndependentIndia the community in general, and young men in particular,are seen as the reverse.130Luhrmann’s book has been ratherunpopular and controversial in some circles.131Yet visitors areoften told that the present generation has none of the hero giantsof the nineteenth century such as Naoroji and PherozeshahMehta. The widely popular Parsi playwright, and former Parsis in Post-Independence Bombay88129This was a theme in the letters column in 1981 for example, see Jame, 2 June 1981and 31 May 1981.

The British Raj has gone, the afflu-ence has gone but the luxury mindedness of the Parsis has remained...the present young Parsi is an odd mixture of a pseudo westerner trying halfheartedly to be absorbed in the Indian scene and Indian culture.The real culprits, he concluded, were the parents. There is alsoa common emphasis on the increase of begging in the community,for example outside temples and the funeral grounds on festivaldays. Separation and divorce are often said to be on the increase.I have been told by well-informed individuals that prostitutionis increasing in the community, both in the form of high-classescorts working the luxury hotels and in brothels, which I havebeen told by a Punchayet official exist in two Parsi colonies. I can-not confirm that at first hand, but whether or not these stories arefactually true, there is a common belief that they are, in markedcontrast to the time when the community in British India proudlyproclaimed that there were no beggars or prostitutes among theParsis. In short, the social standing of Parsis is widely believed inthe community to be declining.A word of caution is needed, however. In most societies, theolder generation condemns the younger generation for not livingup to the standards of their day. Further, just as Parsis are the bestsource of anti-Parsi jokes, so they can be the harshest critics, as wellas the most ardent supporters, of their community. Sometimesthese allegations are part of the message of social reformers andmay be exaggerated. While older Parsis may feel able to voice thesecriticisms, they take less kindly to outsiders doing so. The reason forrelating them here is to outline an element of popular discourseand some of its common themes, to balance the emphasis oncommunity achievements. This discourse is certainly known bydiaspora Zoroastrians, who are the main subject of this book.Whether the historian should take these criticisms as accuratelyreflecting the general state of the community is another question.In contrast, however, to the themes of financial, physical, moraland economic decline, many Parsis stress the reverse, namely theirunique qualities and virtues. All magazines include pieces on Parsiachievements. The best example is perhaps Parsiana, both because ofParsis in Post-Independence Bombay89"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"its coverage and because of its wide international readership. In theseven-year period 1990–6 (taken simply as a sample period, and theone in which Luhrmann did her research) Parsianapublished approx-imately 150 articles on individual Parsis who had been successful.The range is immense: most were on successful business people(38 separate articles132); artists (12); doctors (11); dancers/actors/musicians (8); religious figures (6); journalists (6); lawyers (5); militarypersonnel (4). Others included social workers (3), bankers, teachersand architects. These figures do not include the several pages in eachissue allocated to ‘Events and Personalities’ and ‘ZoroastriansAbroad’, which generally record Parsi achievers, nor the obituaries,nor the various reports on the BPP, Federation, WZO or NavsariAnjuman honouring successful Parsis. They do not take account ofthe whole issue ofParsianadevoted to North American Zoroastrianentrepreneurs.133Luhrmann stresses the Parsi emphasis on memo-ries of a golden past. Over this same seven-year period there werea total of twenty pieces on former heroes, but that figure gives a distorted impression, because in several instances, e.g. the accountof the achievements of the Parsi campaigner for Zoroastrian rightsin Iran, Hataria, the reports are broken down into several episodes(see further below). The general emphasis of this most widely readof Parsi publications is therefore on Parsi success in business, theprofessions and various branches of the arts. This is despite the factthat it was in Parsianathat the stark warnings quoted above, about thedemographic crisis facing the community, were given. Parsis mayhave a memory of a golden past and an awareness of numerical andmaterial decay, but they also have an immense, and legitimate, pridein the continuing achievements of their community. The balancingof the self-image is important. In its positive emphasis,Parsianais notunique, for various publications emphasize the success of theParsis.134It is also a theme in much of the diaspora literature, as willParsis in Post-Independence Bombay90132A subject meriting further study is the networking of Zoroastrian businesses in thisperiod. This theme will recur in the chapter on America. It should, however, be noted herethat the Zoroastrian Co-operative Bank has a long history and until 1985 was forZoroastrians only (Parsiana, Jan. 1986, p. 34 and Dec. 1986, p. 32). In 1993 the Zotarianswere formed to help Parsi business interests (Parsiana, Aug. 1993, p. 20). There are anumber of Parsis on the various boards of the Tata companies, and the world’s richestZoroastrian is probably the owner of the property firm, Pallonji. However it would besimplistic to describe these as Parsi firms. People are not appointed because they are Parsis.133Jan. 1996.134S. H. Katrak,Who are the Parsees?Karachi, 1965; P.

There is both a self-doubt and pride within themodern Parsi community in Mumbai.Conclusion on Parsi societyThere are therefore diverse social groups within Bombay Parsisociety, and diverse (self) perceptions of the state of the commun-ity, in terms of its wealth, dynamism and future. These shouldnot be seen as conflicting perceptions, but rather as complemen-tary wrestling with hopes and fears, memories and strategies forsurvival within a complex but living, and therefore, changingsociety. But the picture is yet more complex and dynamic, for somany social, cultural and political issues revolve around religiousquestions. The turning of the political battles of the CER and theCUZ over the rights of intermarried women to vote in BPPelections into religious issues, and threats of destroying the com-munity, are but one example of how religious questions lie at theheart of many debates. It is not possible to understand the Parsicommunity without looking at both social and religious issues.Religious Movements, and Movements of Religious ThoughtThis section will look first at the physical provisions of the religion—temples, priests and teachers, then at the major schoolsof religious thought, and finally at some of the major debates thathave taken place since Independence.Temples and priestsThe templesThere has been concern for a long time that some rural commun-ities can no longer maintain their religious buildings, such astemples and sanatoria, as numbers diminish with younger andable-bodied persons migrating to Bombay; the few left behind aresimply unable to maintain the properties.135But the problem existsin Mumbai also. Concern was expressed by four trustees of theBPP, and some lay people, in discussions with ParsianaeditorialParsis in Post-Independence Bombay91135See, e.g.Parsiana, March 1983, p. 12 regarding Tithal, and the sale of the sanatoriumto the Jains in the Apr. 1987 issue (A. S. Mama ‘Tithal Sale Stalled’). In Sept. 1986 similarconcerns were expressed about Nargol, and in May 1994, pp. 25–9, it was reported inParsianathat the Federation was having to take over the funding problems at Mhow. This isa theme raised at many Federation meetings."},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"staff as early as 1974, before the debates on declining numbersbecame prominent.136There were then forty-three agiaries andthe four Atash Bahrams. One problem is that the Parsi populationhas declined even in Bombay; it has also relocated, as was notedabove. In particular, people have moved residence from the cen-tral Fort area where nine of the older temples were constructed,notably the Banaji Limji Agiary in 1709, Maneckji Seth (1735)and the Dadiseth (1783) all in the Fort Area. Although some ofthese earliest buildings have been replaced, most of the existingstructures are at least a hundred years old and so in need ofrenovation. As the population moves to the baugs in the suburbs,so the number of people attending in the old quarters declines,and income diminishes both for building work and the priests.Some temples decline because of the popularity of others nearby.At least seven agiaries can be identified which face suchproblems.137In contrast, others are quite well resourced for dif-ferent reasons: seven agiaries are near Parsi colonies; two are closeto offices where Parsis work; some engage in entrepreneurialactivity (selling water or plants); and eight are associated witheither a particular person or religious group.138It is important toParsis in Post-Independence Bombay92136A.

The state of the Langrana Agiary was publicized in Parsiana, Aug. 1983, p. 39(H. D. Doctor, ‘Fire Sale’). Some temples experience such problems with funds and prieststhat they are closed between the boiceremonies performed five times daily to feed the fire.An example of this was the Vaacha Agiary in the Fort area. This remains true also at theGodavara Agiary in the Fort area. Information kindly supplied by Ervad Dr R. Karanjia,principal of the Athornan Madressa, January 1998. For photographs and details of tem-ples in Mumbai, the rest of India and globally see M. J.

The Banaji Limji Agiary in the Fort area is used by office workers, but has noresident priest, so some worker-priests serve in the temple in the morning and in the officein the afternoon. The Dadiseth Agiary is similarly well supported and resourced by officeworkers. Temples supported by an interest in specific religious figures or groups include theKarani Agiary in Cusrow Baug, associated with Aibara; the Dadiseth Agiary in the Fortarea, associated with the Kadmis; the Maneckji Petit Agiary, associated with the Faslis onNew Marine Lines near Church gate station.

Any Parsi can, and does, visit any agiary.The rites performed are the same in each; save only that somelarger temples are able to perform some liturgies, which a lack ofresources makes impossible elsewhere. For example, some keepa bull from which the sacred drink ofnirangcan be consecrated.A further cause for concern is that as the size of the Parsi popu-lation declines, numbers may become too small even to maintainthose temples which currently appear secure.139There have beencalls to move some of the fires to other temples, or to new templesin baugs, as has been done in the past,140but some Orthodoxwriters have questioned the doctrinal soundness of moving fires,even when a building is being renovated.141But again, the story is not wholly one of gloom. In a period ofless than three months at the turn of the millennium, three newhouses of worship were opened in Mumbai.142One was the SethArdeshir Bhicajee Patel Dadgah in the new housing complex inAndheri, consecrated on 23 January 2000. This has the lowestgrade of fire so that it will be easier to maintain in view of thedeclining number of priests. On 14 November 1999 a full Dar-e-Mehr was consecrated, and on 21 December 1999 the ShapoorjiFakirji Jokhi Agiary was opened in the Godrej Baug. The third ofthese, funded from the estate of a Hong Kong Parsi (see Chapter 3),involved transporting the consecrated fire, which was ninety-nineyears old, from the village of Tavri near Navsari in 1964 when theParsi population had dwindled to just one. It was then moved toNavsari to be housed until it was agreed to install it in the newbuilding in Andheri.143The shell of the building had been built,Parsis in Post-Independence Bombay93139See the editorial in Parsiana, Nov. 1994, pp. 3–5.140The fire was, for example, moved from the temple in Aden in 1976 when the last fewParsis left there. In 1994 the Atash Dadgah at Elahi Baug was moved and enshrined in theSir Jamsetji Jijibhoy Agiary in Pune.141Adi Doctor, ‘Face-lift for the Fires’,Parsiana, Aug. 2001, pp. 64–80.142Parsiana, Mar. 2000, pp. 108–44.143This brief account glosses over numerous disputes. There had been previousattempts to house other ancient fires there, but individuals had persuaded the CharityCommissioner to block the move. Despite the title of Godrej Baug (so named because theGodrej family had been the pioneers behind the colony), Naoroji Godrej had resigned indisgust from the BPP when he was falsely accused of seeking to profit from his donation tothe baug.

Thefire was moved first to the temple in Sanjan, where it stayed forthe day, tended by a team of priests, before being moved for thenight to a temple in Mumbai. On the third night it was movedinto its new home in Godrej Baug. The move involved extensivepreparations in order that the fire’s sanctity should not bepolluted. The preservation of the sacred fire, being the presenceof God, is vital, and each fire has its own identity and integrity.The fire must not come into the presence of dirt, or pollution, andits reinstallation involves lengthy and joyous ceremonies. The firewas carried in a receptacle previously designed for, and used in,the transfer of the fire from Aden to Mumbai. Two vehicles wererefitted entirely, one to carry the fire, the other as a back-up incase the first broke down. All seats except the driver’s were takenout, so that the priests could sit and tend and protect the fire intransit. The fire was moved at night so that it should not bedimmed by any other light. Police cleared the road, so that noalien gaze should defile it, and long processions of Parsis accom-panied the fire, led by priests in full priestly garb, with mouths cov-ered (in padan), and drawn swords and priestly maces symbolicallyrepresenting their readiness to fight evil to protect the fire. A lorry-cum-water-carrier washed the roads, which were swept clean, andpavis, or sacred areas, marked in sand. The instalment ceremonieswere then performed. The consequence is that people, young andold, visit their own temple and offer their prayers before the sacredfire far more often than they did when they had to travel a dis-tance. The Agiary is becoming a focal point for the life of the1,700-plus residents of the Godrej Baug.Also at the start of the new millennium, two old Bombay agiar-ies were renovated: the 100-year-old Seth Pherozeshah ArdeshirPatel Dar-e-Mehr, also in Andheri, and the 291-year-old BanajiLimji Agiary, the oldest in Bombay, right in what is now theheart of the city in the Fort Area.144While the building was beingrenovated, the fire was kept apart in a separate room. AlthoughParsis in Post-Independence Bombay94provoked dissent. The details are in A. S. Mama, ‘The Consecrated Convoy’,Parsiana, Mar.2000, pp. 116–49. The account here focuses on what is religiously significant, namely whatis involved in moving a sacred fire, and not on disputes.144SeeParsiana, Aug. 2000, pp. 120–32.

There are also worries about humanresources, particularly the diminishing number of priests. Thiswas the subject of a collection of articles in the November 1997issue ofParsiana. Some of the problems identified were: the lack ofrespect for a priesthood not highly educated in western terms; theconsiderable time and physical demands of the profession; andthe extremely poor pay. The strict discipline associated with thepriest maintaining the required level of physical and spiritualpurity precludes a social life, for attending a theatre or eating out-side is forbidden, especially for those who serve in the sanctuary ofthe Atash Bahrams. It is not a profession chosen by many of theadults, or the children, from priestly families who have bettercareer prospects in the outside world.145In the same month thattheParsianaarticles appeared, the Federation discussed the plightof the priesthood, but concluded that, as it was a delicate matter,a report should be prepared for future discussion. Two of theHigh Priests, Dasturs Mirza and Kotwal, wrote a scathing attackon the debate, saying that discussions and reports had beenproduced for years, dating back to the 1964 World ZoroastrianCongress, the papers of which must be lying in the BPP offices.The time had come, they said, not for reports but for action.146The issue was again discussed at the next World Congress andvarious High Priests wrote articles in the press.147In 1984–5 a scheme to aid the priestly profession became a mat-ter of intense public debate. A young Parsi woman, HuzanParsis in Post-Independence Bombay95145The president of the Cama Athornan Institute, Sir Jamsetjee Jeejeebhoy, appealedfor more candidates to come and study at the Institute because numbers were droppingseriously (Parsiana, June 1982, p. 5).146Parsiana, Feb. 1976, p. 15.147Parsiana, June 1977, p. 5 on the Congress; the relevant papers were published inParsiana, Aug.–Nov. 1978, pp. 35–9. It was something highlighted by Dastur Mirza, whopointed out that such debates went back at least to Sir J. J. Modi, secretary of the BPP in1915 (H. D. K. Mirza,Some Religious Problems Facing the Parsi Community, 2nd edn., Bombay,1983, p. 20)."},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"Kharas, wrote a thesis at Bombay University on the plight of thepriesthood. The thesis was summarized in congresses, publiclectures and in Parsiana.148She interviewed priests at virtually all ofthe agiaries and Atash Bahrams and concluded that the actualstate of the priesthood was worse than the earlier debates had sug-gested. Not only were the priests concerned about their presentimpecunious condition, they were even more concerned at theirinability to provide for their old age, and for medical expenses. Inthe period 1980–5 only seven young boys had come forward forthe priesthood, but in that time fifty priests had died or retired. On11 May 1985 the Athravan Educational Trust (AET ) waslaunched. Prominent among the speakers were Homi Ranina, atrustee of the BPP, Dastur Firoze Kotwal, and Khojeste Mistree ofZoroastrian Studies (discussed below). The thanksgiving jashanwas celebrated by over 200 priests—which means more than halfthe priestly population of Bombay participated. The plans wereoutlined as having two phases. In the first five years, fifteen boyswere to be selected and given a scholarship to facilitate theirstudies, and were guaranteed an income on completion. Therewas also an attempt to extend the traditional priestly trainingcourse. In phase two it was planned to improve the conditionof existing priests. The new Trust was to be overseen on a dailybasis by Huzan Kharas.149AET was controversial even before itsinception. The Council of Vigilant Parsis tried to have an adver-tisement placed in the Jamedecrying the move, and letters for andagainst it appeared in subsequent newsletters and magazines. Thevalidity of the thesis was questioned on the grounds that it was‘a random and biased survey by a “researcher” who did not haveeven an elementary knowledge of the duties and responsibilitiesof a Fire Temple priest’. Kharas was also criticized for her ‘feministlogic’.150In fact, her sample had not been random, but to proveher point she subsequently extended her survey to cover allBombay temples, and the conclusion was reinforced rather thanundermined. More substantial issues were raised by two of theHigh Priests, Dasturs Mirza and JamaspAsa. They criticizedthe Trust because of the details in the Trust Deed, registered withthe Charity Commissioner on 21 February 1985, and published inParsis in Post-Independence Bombay96148July 1984, pp. 11–12.

Their concern was that althoughthe appeal for funds had been made to improve the lot of thepriests, nowhere in the actual Trust Deed did the words‘Athravan’, ‘mobed’ or ‘Parsi priest’ appear. They concluded thatthe Trust must have cosmopolitan, multi-purpose objectives. Theyquoted the concerns expressed by an eminent jurist, S. R. Vakil,published in the Bombay Samacharand the Jame Jamshed.151Theissue was unusual in uniting the editors of both newspapers.Public debates, letters to the papers and public meetings wereorganized.152The scheme went ahead and the first AET ‘gradu-ates’ emerged in 1990.153It has, however, remained a focus ofdebate and legal challenge.154The root causes of the fury over anenterprise concerned to deal with a long-identified religious prob-lem are difficult to determine. On the one hand AET is accusedof claiming charitable status, which requires cosmopolitan con-cerns that it says it does not have; on the other, it is suspected ofhaving cosmopolitan concerns that it was not publicizing.155Somehave alleged that personality clashes lie at the heart of the dispute.Yet there is also the feeling that when a body involving a Dasturand a BPP trustee seeks to deal with a major problem, it is derided.The issue became more complicated by a landlord-tenancy dis-pute over the AET offices in the Cama Oriental Institute building.The court found in favour of AET and in public the furore overAET has subsided. From an outside perspective what seems sad isthat people who are deeply committed to the religion, all froma traditional perspective, are in conflict, and that there is evena division among the Dasturs. Fortunately at the turn of the mil-lennium the Dasturs and most priests are in religious agreementon AET.This problem of visible religious conflict is something that willrecur in succeeding chapters. Public dispute concerning thepriesthood has erupted in other areas also: in conflicts betweentrustees and priests for example, climaxing in 1997 with a conflictbetween Dastur Kotwal and his trustees which led to the Dastur’sresignation.

What emerged was a commitment to the religion, and apride in what their husbands were doing, but a sense of injusticeat the treatment by the Punthakey system158and temple trustees.However, one of the High Priests, Dastur JamaspAsa, hasidentified a different focus of religious concern, namely what he sees as the lack of spiritual commitment on the part ofZoroastrians. This was an issue he addressed publicly in 1984,and has returned to on several occasions since, notably at theSecond World Zoroastrian Youth Congress in London in 1997.His appeal there met with an enthusiastic standing ovation fromthe youth, itself perhaps an indicator that young Zoroastrians dowant to be reminded of the spiritual element at the heart of theirreligion.159Parsis in Post-Independence Bombay98156Parsiana, July 1985, pp. 1–5 concerning the Sodawaterwalla Agiary in Bombay;Sept. 1987, pp. 17–25 in Surat.157Mar. 2001, pp. 193–202.

This emphasis on doctrinal ‘rationality’ waschallenged to some degree by what was then the less popularoccult school of thought; (b) the inter-war years, when westerninfluences declined, the occult teachings remained and Hindudoctrinal influences began to emerge; (c) post-IndependenceIndia, when western influences declined, Hindu influencesincreased and the occult interests expanded.160In the late 1980sand the 1990s, subsequent to Langstaff ’s study, there has alsobeen a growth in what might loosely be termed new religiousmovements and a fascination for the miraculous. This chapter isconcerned only with this post-Independence material. What allpublications, including my own, had focused on was either thephysical side of the religion—temples and priests, or the textualside—what people wrote. There had been a consistent neglect ofthe popular level of spirituality. This has been corrected by a pub-lication of Philip Kreyenbroek, in collaboration with Shehnaz N.Munshi. They collected the oral traditions of a range of indi-viduals, traditionalist, neo-traditionalist, modernist, occult, etc.161Some of that invaluable material is incorporated into this chapter.Parsi scholarshipThere have been several different types of writing produced byBombay Parsis. It is, perhaps, important to begin with the schol-arly and historical studies that have been produced within thecommunity.

It wasimportant to set the more popular writings within the context ofParsi scholarship, but for the purposes of this section it is the morepopular writings that are central. The following pages will lookfirst at some of the doctrinal movements within the community,and then at some of the issues that have been debated.Parsis and Hindu philosophyHinduism has long exerted influence on the Parsis.171It can beseen in various customs, for example, marking the forehead withred kunkun on auspicious occasions, and in the impact of castetraditions on the perceptions of community boundaries. In thepre-British period some Parsi priests were students and teachers ofSanskrit, but it is remarkable how relatively little of this appears tohave seeped into the broad stream of community belief. In thehundred years of Protestant influence, approximately fromthe 1840s to the 1940s, various reform movements sought to eradic-ate what were seen as superstitious Hindu accretions. But after thedeparture of British rule, and in Independent, secular—butHindu-dominated—India, the more philosophical dimensions ofHindu traditions can be seen to exercise an influence on Parsiwriters. The Bengali Hindu, J. M. Chatterji, wrote three booksinterpreting Zoroastrianism in the light of his faith.172It is notpossible to document the impact of these books, although theycan be seen on bookshelves in the homes of many Bombay Parsisand they are occasionally quoted in Parsi writings. What they indi-cate to Parsis is a serious and sympathetic interest in their religionby a Hindu writer. From the Parsi perspective, one of the earliestwriters to incorporate traditional Hindu philosophy wasTaraporewala, a now widely respected translator of the Gathas.He used the teachings ofpurushaandprakritito explain ideas ongood and evil, and also expounded his belief in karma andrebirth.173Wadia is an example of a post-Independence writerdeploying Hindu philosophical terms and ideas to elucidate hisZoroastrian beliefs. For example, he uses Hindu terms in hisattempt to ‘penetrate into the very depth of man’ to understandParsis in Post-Independence Bombay101171A more detailed study of the next two sections can be found in Selected Works, ch. 12.172J.

All appearances are mayawhen seen from theuniversality of cosmic consciousness’ (p. 98). In these interpreta-tions Bode believed that Hindu teachings gave an insight into theIndo-Iranian thought-world of the prophet Zoroaster, whom hedescribed as ‘the Founder of the Mystical Magian Brotherhood...the Master Adept in the science of spiritual Self-Unfoldment,who mystically apprehended all the Divine Laws governing theUniverse. He was a Ratu—Illustrious Master of SpiritualWisdom’ (p. 30). Obviously an outside western academic wouldquestion the historical continuity between Zoroaster’s teachingsand Bode’s account. But all religions change through time, and asthey settle in different cultures so many adherents seek to explaintheir beliefs in ways that seem meaningful, that ‘speak to’ thesituation of their audience. As Christian theology has indigenizedin India, Africa and Europe, so has Zoroastrianism in India.

In the 1940s he was verbally, almost physically,attacked for his role in the Bansda naujotesdiscussed below. He was unpopular in manyquarters for his association with an American group claiming occult links withZoroastrianism, a group headed by Mother Gloria. Because of the time he spent inAmerica, he was eventually asked to resign his Dasturship. Controversy continued to beassociated with him in India, though he had a following in some diaspora groups.

Kreyenbroek includesstories of Parsis using Hindu beliefs and practice, without any senseof inconsistency. So, for example, Mrs E, speaking of her Parsimother-in-law said: ‘she does have pictures [of Sai Baba], I thinkthat she believes very strongly in Ganesh, but only as an outsider,not as part of her. She says it is lucky, Lakshmi is [also] lucky. I thinklots of Parsis believe in that kind of thing.’ She goes on to talk abouther mother-in-law observing the Hindu custom of washing moneyin milk on the thirteenth day of the Divali festival, which manyParsis also observe, and also appeals to her. She then talks about herfather: ‘he has suddenly very much gone into Hindu philosophy, hereads a lot of that. And he has some very interesting books; I myselfhave been very attracted to Maharishi Ramana’s philosophy.’178Parsis and the occultThe majority of Parsi publications in Independent India, how-ever, have reflected various expressions of occult tradition(s).Parsis were very active in the Theosophical Society, from themovement’s arrival in Bombay in 1879 until Annie Besant movedthe centre to Madras in 1907; she also increasingly emphasizedthe Society’s Hindu links. At that point the Parsis became lessactive. What Theosophy had offered was an alternative to thewestern, rational, Protestant-like trends of the reformers. It hadjustified cherished Zoroastrian traditions such as prayer anddevotion to the fire, and yet had done so in a movement which,coming from the West, was not seen as being merely reactionary.Theosophy was attractive to the educated of many Indian com-munities for the same reasons. It encouraged allegiance to one’sreligious heritage, be that Zoroastrianism or Hinduism, whichTheosophists declared had a depth of occult science and experi-ence that western scholars failed to comprehend. These religiousneeds that Theosophy had met continued after 1907.179From theParsis in Post-Independence Bombay103178Kreyenbroek,Living Zoroastrianism, pp. 192–5. This is one of many such examplesincluded by Kreyenbroek.179There have been a few Zoroastrian individuals who have seen themselves asmembers of the Theosophical Society. The most prominent writer among them wasDastur K. S. Dabu, a man much respected for his quiet life of devotion and discipline, evenby those who do not share his doctrinal position. Three of his books are:Messageof Zarathushtra, Bombay, 1956;Zarathushtra and His Teachings, Bombay, 1966;Handbook ofInformation on Zoroastrianism, Bombay, 1969."},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"1920s there emerged what might be described as a ZoroastrianTheosophy, Ilm-i Khshnoom, or the path of knowledge. It replacedTheosophy’s hidden Tibetan masters with a secret race of phys-ical and spiritual giants living in Iran who had preserved theancient spiritual teachings of that country. These teachings, it wasclaimed, had been imparted in secret to Behramshah Shroff. Heand his followers started their teaching in Surat in 1907 butmoved to Bombay two years later.180From the 1960s Khshnoomicteaching has increased in influence. Like Theosophy, it teachesthat the soul must seek release from its material bonds by a life ofasceticism and vegetarianism. There is a belief in each person’sspiritual aura, which must be protected from the impurity of evilas the soul seeks to progress upwards towards release from theround of rebirth. Khshnoomists believe that each person is borninto the religion God considered appropriate for his or her state ofspiritual advancement, and that Zoroastrianism is the religion intowhich one is born prior to final release. There are, however, dif-ferent ‘wings’ of Khshnoom. There is no formal movement witha defined membership, and liturgical differences are minimal—basically Khshnoomists stress the strict observance of traditionallaws, especially in matters related to purity. There is only onetemple built by Khshnoomists, and any Zoroastrian may enter, sothat it would be wrong to treat Ilm-i Khshnoom as a sect; it israther a movement of belief. Within that movement there arethree main teaching groups. One group was led by Pundole,whose followers built a temple in the holy village of Udwada. Thiscaused an outcry among some of the Orthodox, because it wasthought to be wrong to build a temple near to the great AtashBahram, in which burns the most revered of all Parsi fires, conse-crated as an act of thanksgiving when Parsis arrived in India. Thematter went to court, which found in favour of the Pundolites.181A second group follows the teachings of Dr (Mrs) MeherMaster-Moos. She claims to have found trunks full of the writingsof the master Behramshah Shroff, and states that her books areParsis in Post-Independence Bombay104180On Shroff see Hinnells, ‘Behramshah Naoroji Shroff ’,Encyclopaedia Iranica, vol. iv,fasc. 1, pp. 109 f.181See the account in Parsiana, Aug. 1981, pp. 51ff. and on Pundolite doctrine,ParsianaSupplement, Sept. 1983, p. 11.

She also runs a college inthe town of Sanjan, where Parsis are thought to have arrived inIndia, and links her teaching to holistic alternative medicine.There is an extended interview with Dr Master-Moos inKreyenbroek ( pp. 231–8). One of the main purposes of her col-lege, she said: ‘was to prepare the people of this earth for leadinga life in harmony with Cosmic Laws which are contained in theancient Avestan tradition, and to prepare people for the advent ofthe Spiritual Rainnidar, Shah Varjavand Sahin at the end of this[i.e. twentieth] century or at the beginning of the next century.’She explained her belief in the occult power of the higherliturgies, the YasnaandVendidadand above all the Nirangdin. Onlythe souls which have had these ceremonies performed for themcan proceed speedily from the cycle of reincarnation throughnumerous travails before proceeding to the Chinvat Bridge wherethe soul discards even its ethereal body. It then proceeds onthrough the solar system. She believes that in 1981 her astral bodywas transported by Sarosh Yazad (the Yazata, or heavenly being,Sraosha) through different levels of existence to be initiatedfor her work. She saw her own life, past, present and future andhad a vision of the founder of Khshnoom, Shroff. Much of herteaching focuses on the idea of each person having their own aurawhich can affect, and be affected by, the vibrations of rituals orpolluted by evil, impure vibrations.Two teachers who reject Mrs Moos’ claim to have access toShroff ’s own writings expound what they believe to be hisauthentic teaching. They are Adi Doctor182and K. N.

My subjective impression is that they are more influentialtoday than they were twenty years earlier. Parsis who may notcall themselves Khshnoomists nevertheless find some of theirteachings and language helpful; this is so among the priesthood aswell as the laity, even though Shroff and his followers were notthemselves priests. Perhaps the most widely accepted of theirbeliefs are those concerning astral bodies and the powerfullypositive vibrations of Avestan prayers.Zoroastrian StudiesIn 1977 a doctrinally very different religious group developed,Zoroastrian Studies, founded by Khojeste Mistree and ShehrnazPanthaky. Mistree had previously forsaken a career as an account-ant in London in order to study his religion at the University ofOxford under R. C. Zaehner. Zaehner died early on in Mistree’sstudies, and his supervision was undertaken by Prof. Mary Boyceat the School of Oriental and African Studies in London. Thissupervision proved significant. Mistree had both an interest inmystical practices and a hunger for knowledge about the early his-tory of his religion. Boyce was then elaborating her theories onthe essential continuity of the Zoroastrian tradition, preserved,she believed, with great faithfulness by the priests over the millen-nia in the liturgical setting, which in an oral tradition, she argued,ensured strict adherence to the word.184Her scholarly influence isevident in much of Mistree’s teachings.185After graduation,Mistree returned to Bombay and, aided in the first few weeks byone of his Oxford contemporaries, Dr Alan Williams, began aprogramme of public lectures on Zoroastrianism.186They provedso popular that Bombay auditoria had to be hired, and still lec-tures had to be repeated because of the interest they aroused.Between 1978 and 1980 he gave more than one lecture per week inParsis in Post-Independence Bombay106184See ch. 1 in Selected Worksfor a discussion of Boyce’s theories.185Some of his opponents criticized him for being under the influence of Mary Boyce.Thus Parsee Voice, I. 16, 1–15 June 1984: ‘however tradition-bound one might be as astudent in India, after one goes abroad, breathes the air of materialism and imbibes theWestern materialistic culture, one tends to fly off at a tangent. The classic case of the lateDr M. N. Dhalla is right before us.’186SeeParsiana, June 1980, Supplement, pp. 25–7."},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"various institutes and fire temples. In 1978 he began teaching-visitsoverseas, in Australia, Britain, North America and in numerousother diaspora communities. Generally the majority of his audi-ences were young, well-educated professionals wanting to knowmore about their heritage. Inevitably, perhaps, his popularity pro-voked opposition from both Orthodox and Reform groups, fromthe Khshnoomists and from the Liberal Dastur Bode. The BombaySamacharwas strongly opposed to Mistree, though the OrthodoxJame Jamshedwas more sympathetic—indeed in 1980 it voted himman of the year. When he began formal structured courses in1979, students had to gain entry by submitting pieces of writtenwork, for he intended to train this first group into teachers to workwith him. A number did so after completing a three-year course.Zoroastrian Studies, therefore, began as an educational body.187This work has been continued through a newsletter, started in1979, assuming its present format and nomenclature Ushtain1982. The newsletter not only includes information about ZSactivities; it also has a children’s page and often includes moresubstantial pieces written either by ZS members or by scholars ofthe religion. From the early days, the religious education has beenboth for educated adults, and for children in separate classes. Inthe 1990s several Parsi schools asked ZS to run their religious edu-cation classes; indeed, such demand for classes exceeded what ZScould supply. There have been two publications by ZS for thesedifferent groups: Ava Mehta, a school teacher, wrote a book forchildren188and Mistree wrote a book for adults.189ZS is thelargest religious education organization in the Zoroastrian worldand also helps non-Zoroastrian scholars studying the Parsis inMumbai. In addition ZS sells some publications of western andParsi scholars for Parsis in Mumbai. The education programmehas always involved religious practice, prayers and meditations.In the 1990s, as the situation eased in Iran, Mistree organizedregular (mostly annual) religious and educational pilgrimages toIran, which have attracted Zoroastrians from various countriesand are now being copied by other groups. As an expression oftraditional Zoroastrian ideals, ZS has also undertaken charitableParsis in Post-Independence Bombay107187Mistree gave an account of his vision for Zoroastrian Studies in its early years inParsiana, Aug. 1981, pp. 46–9.188A.

Some of Mistree’scritics argue that he is making Zoroastrianism into a dualism, andallege that he calls upon Zoroastrians to worship two gods.192Most western academics would argue that the belief in an all-loving God opposed to a powerful evil being is to be found notonly in the Pahlavi literature but in the earlier texts also. Mistreeis condemned by some Orthodox and Liberal Parsis for acceptingwestern scholarship;193but he also emphasizes many Orthodoxteachings, notably on purity and pollution, opposition to inter-marriage, and the religious obligation to perform traditionalceremonies and prayers in the sacred language. Despite hisOrthodox critics, therefore, it is reasonable to describe him asOrthodox.The interview with Mistree published in Kreyenbroek’s bookbrings out more about Mistree’s mystical experience than any pre-vious publication has.194He had experienced the paranormal inchildhood, from Hindu families his mother treated as a doctor inPune. He became well known as a water diviner, and it was hisParsis in Post-Independence Bombay108190Ushta, Aug. 1986.191This statement requires some modification, in that Shaked has argued that there wasno single Zoroastrian tradition until the pressures of Islamic oppression forced the prieststo define more precisely what constitutes Zoroastrianism (Dualism in Transformation: Varietiesof Religion in Sasanian Iran, London, 1994). He argues that the Pahlavi literature containsone group’s perception of Zoroastrianism, and that prior to the Islamic era there was adiversity of religious traditions in ancient Iran. Nevertheless, Shaked accepts that much ofthe doctrine in that literature is legitimately characterized as Zoroastrian. For a discussion,seeSelected Works, ch. 1 and Boyce’s response BSoAs59, 1996, pp. 68–86.192This is an allegation often made by writers in the Reformist ‘wing’ of the community,including the Bombay Samachar, and by many Iranian Zoroastrians in the West. But it isasserted also by some Orthodox writers, e.g. the High Priest Dastur H. D. K. Mirza in anarticle in Samachar, 8 Oct. 1994; see also 12 Feb. 1995 and 14 May 1995.193So Sir Rustom Masani in Samachar, 3.1982, similarly Samachar, 1 Feb. 1981; 8 Nov.1981.

As well as studying books onZoroastriarism he also studied Kabbalah and then with a Sufigroup in London. While sitting quietly he received messages, ordirections. He was told by a Sufi teacher to go to Iran to learnmore about the spiritual life, and to deepen his religious under-standing of Zoroastrianism. The ‘miraculous’ aspects of that andother ventures are clearly something which lie at the heart of hisreligious work. He comments in the interview on how he commu-nicates with the sacred fires, and they with him. On the pilgrim-ages he leads to Iran he seeks to help others experience theparanormal, mystical, side of the religion, as well as learningabout Zoroastrian history. He believes that a good Zoroastrianreligious education based on sound scholarship is the key to thecommunity’s survival, but this is inseparable from the personalreligious experience of his living Zoroastrianism.Diverse religious strandsThe westernized, liberal, reforming movement does not havemany followers in Bombay post-Independence. The themeappears in the Bombay literature, notably in the Bombay Samachar,but also in the letters column ofParsiana. However, these columnsare often written by ‘out of town’ Parsis, notably by overseasZoroastrians, for example Farokh Vajifdar from London, Prof.Kaikhusroo Irani in New York and Dr Ali Jafarey in California.This is in contrast to the second half of the nineteenth century,and the early twentieth century. What is growing in Mumbai is aninterest in new religious movements in general, and groups asso-ciated with miracles and miraculous prayers in particular.The non-Zoroastrian figure who probably attracts most atten-tion is Sai Baba, both Sai Baba of Shirdi and the living Satya SaiBaba.

Some roadside shrines, for example, haveimages of figures from Hinduism, Christianity, the Babas andother religions. There is also a widespread custom of praying oncea week at certain holy places for seven consecutive weeks, forexample at a Catholic church in Mahim and at a Muslim holy site(Hajji Ali Tomb). Numbers of Parsis have taken part in thispilgrimage for several years.198One lady who was interviewed forKreyenbroek’s book said: ‘I pray to Mother Mary, and to dearDominic Xavier...[F]or Sai Baba I just light a simple divo, I puta little statue, that is all, and I say “Sai Baba, please help us”.’199Another, when talking of the healing which follows special prayersat one of the agiaries, related:And there are Parsis praying to the peepul tree also, it is a Hindu beliefbecause Shiva is supposed to be in the peepul tree.

Prayers offered on such occasionsare thought by some to bring miraculous cures.201One ladyin Kreyenbroek’s study expresses these sentiments in a typicalmanner: ‘I believe very strongly in Behram Yazad.

One particularly popular figure isDastur205Jamsedji Sorabji Kookaduru (1831–1900). He isbelieved to have lived a simple life, never using a vehicle, and tohave prayed intensively, sometimes with miraculous results ofhealing.206On a noted occasion he is said to have produced gold,which enabled the building of the last of the Atash Bahrams,the Anjuman Atash Bahram in Dhobi Talao in Bombay. A hall isnamed after him in that Atash Bahram to this day. His followersalso believed that because, ‘His third eye had opened, he was ableto foretell future events accurately.’207Kookadaru’s popularity has increased from the 1960s because ofthe teaching of a follower, Ervad Nadarsha N. Aibara (1933–89).208From the age of 7 Aibara prayed intensely and heard a voiceguiding him, that of Kookadaroo.

He felt uplifted and pure’ ( p. 12).209Thereafter Aibarabecame famous for giving people nirangswhich helped in sickness,or at times of personal crisis. Aibara never claimed these to be hisown nirangs, but rather that they were inspired by Kookadaru. Hisson described what happened in the following words:and some Zoroastrians used to come to him, saying, ‘Dasturji, my prob-lem is this, my problem is that...’sickness problems, business problems,anything. Anyone can come and say, please give me some prayers so thatI can get relief. So he used to give certain lines, ‘You pray this.’ Thoselines were given from the reply which he was getting from inside, fromthe inner voice...210He also strongly encouraged people to read and hold in theirmind the stories from the Shah-name. In 1979 he moved to theKarani Agiary in what is known as the queen of the colonies,Cusraw Baug. Parsis came from far and wide to seek his guidanceandnirangs. On the guidance of the voice within him, he cam-paigned, eventually successfully, for the building of KukadarooHall in the Agiary. Various grateful Zoroastrians had wanted topay Dastur Aibara for his help, but he had always refused on theinstruction of the inner voice, until one day he was told to putthe donations into a Kookadaru Trust, and it was from this money that the hall was built.211Also at his insistence aKookadaru Agiary was started at Sanjan, a consecration attendedby Dastur Firoze Kotwal, though no other High Priests or leadingmembers of the BPP attended. Many believed that it was impract-ical to build a temple where there were only fifteen to twentyParsis in Post-Independence Bombay112209The same incident is related by his son in Kreyenbroek,Living Zoroastrianism, p. 260.210Kreyenbroek,Living Zoroastrianism, p. 259.211Quoted in Kreyenbroek,Living Zoroastrianism, pp. 263–5.

There is relat-ively little evidence of Parsis converting to Christianity or Islam.The Indian holy men who are popular are those who encouragepeople to find spirituality within their own tradition and who donot ask them to sever their connections with their heritage. Someseek inspiration from participating in religious acts shared withother religions, but quietly many others seek it within their ownsacred space and from their own holy men.An unusual Parsi ‘holy couple’ are Jai Gururani Nagkanya(Yogini), or Mataji,—formerly known as Nargis MinocherBharucha—and her heir, Jai Gurudev Sri Jimmy Yogiraj, formerlyJimmy Pallonji Master. They are leaders of a new religious move-ment, based in their own Parsi Wadia colony in Lal Baug, buttheir followers are predominantly non-Parsis. The ‘holy couple’are considered by their devotees to ‘possess inborn divinity,enlightened to become one with the Almighty’. Gururani, in par-ticular, is said to have performed countless healing miracles, andboth of them can bestow grace through their darshanas, in hallscharged with shakti—the benevolent force that precedes andlingers in places graced by the celestial duo. But again, this is a move-ment that does not involve the rejection of a Parsi’s Zoroastrianheritage, because Gururani regularly visits Zoroastrian templesand ceremonies, taking her Parsi devotees on trips to Udwada. Itis not Zoroastrianism that she rejects but the spiritual power of theParsi priests.213Two main themes emerge from this brief overview of Parsireligious movements. The first is that, in contrast to the earlierperiods studied by Langstaff, there is minimal western influenceon post-Independence Parsi religious movements. Only Mistreemight be said to show the influence of western scholarship. But,unlike earlier Reform movements, this has not resulted in whatmight be described as the Protestantization of his message, forParsis in Post-Independence Bombay113212A. S. Mama, ‘The Significance of Sanjan’,Parsiana, Dec. 1989, pp. 20–6.213H. J.

Second, in phenomenology of religionterms, what one can see among late twentieth-century Parsis is agrowth in forms of new religious movements. Students of suchphenomena in the West typically emphasize how these move-ments are most commonly found among the educated middleclasses, people who are instinctively religious but do not findfulfilment in their received religion.214Parsis are an obvious‘recruiting ground’ for such movements. But it is only those groupsthat do not demand a conversion that would involve them inrejecting their inherited religion which normally attract Parsis, forthe Parsi sense of ‘tribal’ loyalty (a phrase used by many Parsis), or‘Parsi-panu’, Parsi culture, is very strong. What many seek is a spir-itual, charismatic leadership that they can enjoy without rejectingtheir heritage.There is another dimension to Parsis and religion which hasto be acknowledged also, namely the level of secularization.‘Parsi-panu’ is powerful, but belief in a God, or the formal religiouspractice, is not something which characterizes everyone. SamM. Taraporevala produced a fascinating—if sad to read—Ph.D.thesis on the religion of Parsi college students.215From a sophisti-cated statistical analysis of a survey questionnaire he concludedthat although a high proportion of Zoroastrian undergraduatesbelieved in some sort of God, only a small proportion were activein the religion. His conclusions on what were the important influ-ences among those who were religious are particularly interesting.The major factor was, not surprisingly, the family and its spiritu-ality; he found especially that it was the mother much more thanthe father who taught the children about the religion. He classi-fied the level of religious activity and found that generally studentsfollowed the religion of their parents, though usually the parentswere more active. After the parents, the grandparents were theParsis in Post-Independence Bombay114214There is such a mass of literature on this subject it is not easy to give a reasonableoverview in a necessarily short space. Two obvious examples are E. Barker,The Making ofa Moonie, Oxford, 1984, repr. 1993—on patterns of recruitment among the followers of theReverend Moon’s Unification Church, and Tanya Luhrmann,Persuasions of the Witch’s Craft,Harvard, 1989, on recruitment among magical and witchcraft groups in London.215‘Religiosity in an Urban Setting: A Study of Parsi College Students in the City ofBombay’, University of Bombay, 1987 (unpublished)."},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"next important factor, or a teacher whom they had encountered.Taraporevala looked also at the influence of the college, ofpeers—where he found religion was rarely discussed. One part ofhis conclusion has special importance for Parsi planners, andpoints the way to some further research, for he found that amongcollegians, those who grew up in a baug were more likely topractise their religion than those from cosmopolitan areas( pp. 358–61). The implication of his work is that future leaders inthe Parsi community may have a decreasing commitment to theirreligious heritage. In a community that values and pursues highereducation, this substantial evidence of a declining religious com-mitment among students is a serious matter.Recent Parsi debatesIntroductionThere are various subjects of lively debate within the Mumbai com-munity at the dawn of the new millennium which do not impactgreatly on the diaspora communities, including calendar issuesand to some extent the Tower of Silence (dokhma) controversies.Different methods of intercalation have resulted in the observanceof two calendars in the community in India, Shahenshai andKadmi. The pattern of festivals is the same, but they are observeda few weeks apart. This has led to only minimal liturgical differ-ences, and no doctrinal disputes. Although in the pre-British periodthis was a matter of bitter, indeed violent, argument, in the twenty-first century the continuing debates are not as fierce as they used tobe. In the early twenty-first century, there was an attempt to reformthe calendar and make it consistent with the western Gregoriancalendar, but this resulted simply in a third calendar, the Fasli.Generally the diaspora groups prefer the Fasli calendar because it iseasier to integrate into the western calendar of their environment,but many Associations follow the other calendars in order to avoidconflict with the ‘old country’. So it has been a matter of debate,but not as intense as it is in India. It is not, therefore, necessary togo into this issue in detail in this book.Controversy over the dokhmasThere have been debates in Bombay concerning the Towers ofSilence for many years. In part this has been concern over reportingParsis in Post-Independence Bombay115"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"in the outside press of the unhygienic nature of the dokhmasandallegations that crows drop human remains in the roads, as notedabove. But more fundamental within the Parsi press have been thethreats to, but the determination to preserve, the traditionalTower of Silence funerals, or dokhmenashini. This has been such afierce debate, and remains so at the beginning of the millennium,that it cannot be neglected here, even if it does not impact greatlyon the diaspora communities. A central question has beenwhether there are enough vultures to maintain the practice. In1973 a new BPP trustee, Shiavax R. Vakil, declared publicly thatas the BPP trustee with responsibility for the funeral grounds(Doongerwadi), he had entered the dokhmato see whether reportsof bodies lying rotting for a long time were true. He said that hesaw many bodies lying there untouched, they were in variousdegrees of rotting, and the stench was terrible. He condemned theBPP and the priests for insisting on people using the dokhmas,inBombay or elsewhere, where there were no vultures and said thatother forms of disposal should be allowed.216This debate slowly subsided, despite occasional eruptions. But itwas renewed with yet greater ferocity at the turn of the millennium.A virus decimated the vulture population so there could no longerbe any doubt that the corpses were not being devoured, andwere being left to decay over a very long period. The smell wasnauseous to nearby residents, and entering the dokhmawas sorevolting that the corpse bearers were not exposing the body inthe traditional manner. The bereaved grieved at the thought oftheir loved ones being delivered into such conditions. Many calledfor accepting the use of burial or a crematorium, and if not thebuilding of a crematorium for Zoroastrians at Doongerwadi, thenat least for having the funeral prayers recited at Doongerwadi,before the body was taken to the Bombay crematorium. Some feltthat this threatened the revered tradition, but their solutions to theproblems diverged. Two solutions have not provoked muchcontroversy—yet. One involves the use of herbal-cum-chemicalpowders to curtail the stench emerging from the dokhma; theother pumping ozone gases in to dissipate it. The priests gave theirclearance to both these projects providing the walls of the dokhmawere not breached.Parsis in Post-Independence Bombay116216SeeParsiana, Nov.–Dec. 1973, pp. 7–19."},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"Discussion has focused on two other proposed solutions.Khojeste Mistree and his ZS members called for a breedingprogramme under the guidance of a British vulture specialist,making the area an aviary in which young vultures brought fromelsewhere could be reared and bred. A different solution was pro-posed by others, notably Dr Homi Dhalla, who campaigned forthe installation of solar heat panels which would concentrate solarenergy to dry out the decaying corpses more quickly. The formerproject is said by its opponents to be unlikely to succeed, becauseof the number of birds that would be needed, and the danger ofa further virus making all the extensive provisions pointless. Itwould also be the most expensive of the options. However, thevulture specialist said that it was possible, and its advocatespointed out that this would preserve the old traditions. The solarpanels are dismissed by the opponents as ‘frying the bodies’.Dastur Kotwal publicly declared that solar panels were a form ofsolar crematorium within the precincts of the dokhmas. The systemhas also been said to be unusable in the wet monsoon periods.The BPP trustees called a Samast Anjuman meeting, which wasattended by over a thousand Parsis. The arguments were fierce,and vitriolic, but the vast majority supported the aviary project.The trustees subsequently said they would examine the options indetail. At first they were inclined to allow people who, in theprevailing circumstances, wanted to do so, to have the prayersperformed at Doongerwadi before committal in the crematorium.But the Orthodox opposition was immediate and fierce, so thatthe trustees rescinded their decision.217At the time of writing, thefierce arguments continue, with no decision yet in sight. This isnot an issue which impinges significantly on the diaspora, sincethere is no possibility ofdokhmenashinioverseas, and cremation,or burial, are inevitable. Some in the diaspora feel alienated bythe intensity of this argument, which they see as a local affair forMumbai; they think it displays an insensitivity to the feelings of thosein the diaspora who are compelled to have the form offuneral beingso vehemently attacked by many in the old country.218Parsis in Post-Independence Bombay117217Parsiana, Jan. 2001, pp. 32–7, on the Samast Anjuman, and pp. 41 f., on the debate atthe Federation.

This caused consid-erable debate in Bombay over the portrayal of the prophetand his teachings. It, and similar issues such as the conversion ofan American, Peterson, will be discussed in the chapter on thecountry where the matter first arose, North America.Intermarriage and conversionIntroduction and the legal backgroundIntermarriage and the related issueof conversion are the biggest issues in Mumbai religious debatesthat have an impact on the diaspora groups. These topics, there-fore, merit detailed discussion. It is also necessary to give a briefaccount of related matters early in the twentieth century. In 1903the Parsi industrial giant, J. R. D. Tata, married a French lady,Suzanne Brière. Her naujotewas performed and the couple’s claimwas that she was thereby entitled to the privileges of a Parsi, forexample the use of temples and, in due course, a funeral ina Tower of Silence. Never had such a conversion been knownbefore, at least such a public one. There was intense debate.A committee was established to discuss the question ofjuddin(non-Zoroastrian) initiations. Its subcommittee produced a reportsaying that when Parsis arrived in India they had accepted thosewho wanted to embrace the religion. The main committee refusedto accept the report and blocked its publication. During thisdebate a Rajput lady, married to a Zoroastrian, had her naujoteperformed and declared she wanted to have a dokhmafuneral. Asshe was in poor health this was an issue that could not be longdelayed. The BPP, through its then secretary Dr (later Sir) JivanjiModi, sought the advice of legal council. Council was divided. Ata public meeting in 1905 resolutions were passed saying that onlyParsi Zoroastrians and not converts were entitled to benefit fromParsi Trusts and institutions (i.e. temples and dokhmas). The matterwent to court in 1906, the Parsi Panchayet Case, Suit no. 689.The plaintiffs were not only members of the Tata family, includ-ing J. R. D., but also other Parsi dignitaries, Sir Cowasji Jehangirand Sir Dinshaw Petit. Their case was twofold: (a) that properlyinitiated persons should be recognized as Zoroastrians andParsis in Post-Independence Bombay118"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"entitled to benefit from the Trusts; (b) that the current board oftrustees was not legally constituted since they had not been electedbut had been appointed by their predecessors. They were there-fore unable to make any directives. Sir Jamsetji Jijibhoy (IVthbaronet) led the BPP defendants. The community was, therefore,seen to be split at its highest social level. The case was one ofprinciple. Some Parsis have justified excluding non-Parsis fromcommunity charities on the grounds that the number of poor peo-ple who would convert to benefit from the charities would swampthe restricted funds.219Clearly there was no prospect of Mrs Tataseeking charitable help. The matter was therefore a specificallyreligious one concerning access to temples and dokhmas.The Orthodox Parsi judge, Mr Justice Davar, presided, butbecause of the sensitive nature of the case he was joined by theEnglish judge, Mr Justice Beaman.220(The latter was, however, anactive Theosophist, a movement antithetical to the Reforminggroups and supportive of the Orthodox.) Their judgement on thelegality of the trustees appointment was clear—they agreed withthe plaintiffs and the BPP was told to organize an electoralscheme, the trustees being given interim legal powers to continuethe workings of the Punchayet. It is on the other issue thatattention is focused here. It is also the more complex of the twoissues. The plaintiffs’ contention was that Zoroastrianism not onlypermitted, but enjoined, conversion. The two ladies did not them-selves appear in court, and the senior judge, Mr Justice Davar,concluded that this meant the court could not rule on the crucialissue: since they made no claim, a claim could not be judged. JusticesDavar and Beaman then proceeded to give their ‘commentary’, orParsis in Post-Independence Bombay119219When noting the fear of the funds designated for Parsis being swamped, it shouldalso be noted that the Parsis had separately made very substantial charitable donations tocosmopolitan charities, e.g. the founding of the city’s largest hospital, the Sir JamsetjeeJeejeebhoy Hospital. For a study of Parsi charity, see Selected Works, ch. 11.220Perhaps the best account of the case is Writer,Contemporary Zoroastrians, pp. 129–49.There is also a good discussion in J. S. Palsetia,The Parsis of India:Preservation of Identity inBombay City, Leiden, 2001, pp. 226–51, and 266–75 on the related Rangoon case. The 1906case was serialized in Parsiana, Oct. 1981, pp. 16–13; Nov. 1981, 2–3; Dec. 1981, pp. 10–12;Jan. 1982, pp. 2–5; Feb. 1982, pp. 3–5; Mar. 1982, pp. 35–39; Apr. 1982, pp. 4–7; May1982, pp. 14–19; June 1982, pp. 21–5; July 1982, pp. 2–4; Aug. 1982, pp. 57–71; Sept. 1982,pp. 3–5; Oct. 1982, pp. 29–31; Nov. 1982, pp. 4–5,11; Jan. 1983, pp. 29–33, 37; Mar. 1983,pp. 79–83.

The defendants citedhistorical cases, and produced in court people who claimed tohave been converted and had their naujotesperformed. Davar’scondemnation of the priests, and others involved in their initia-tion, clearly betrayed his Orthodox position. He concluded thatalthough Zoroastrianism had practised conversion, this practicehad fallen into disuse in India:while I find that although the conversion of juddins is permissibleamongst Zoroastrians, I also find that such conversions are entirelyunknown to the Zoroastrian communities of India; and far from it beingcustomary or usual for them to convert a juddin, the Zoroastrian com-munities of India have never attempted, encouraged, or permitted theconversion of juddins to Zoroastrianism...The usage of twelve cen-turies, however, proves that, under their altered circumstances—awayfrom their fatherland, amidst surroundings never within the contempla-tion of the Prophet when he promulgated his religion—the enjoymentto propagate the Zoroastrian religion amongst aliens has fallen intocomplete disuse.221Mr Justice Beaman came to a similar conclusion via a differentroute, for he concluded that the Parsis had become a caste andthat within Indian society people could not be converted from onecaste to another. Lineage, he concluded, was everything in Parsithinking. The most blameless foreigner could not be admitted, butanyone of Zoroastrian lineage could be. The matter, he said, wasnot a matter of religion but of ‘pure, unadulterated Orientalcaste’.222He concluded that if an entire juddinwas admitted to thereligion, he or she would not, as a matter of right, be entitled touse the Funds and institutions which had beenfounded and endowed only for the members of the Parsi community,and that the Parsi community consists of Parsis who are descended fromthe original Persian emigrants, and who are born of Zoroastrian parents,and who profess the Zoroastrian religion, who came to India, eithertemporarily or permanently, and the children of Parsi fathers by alienmothers who have been duly and properly admitted into the religion.223The judgement in the 1906 case was reinforced in the commun-ity mind by a case in Rangoon involving a girl called Bella.224Parsis in Post-Independence Bombay120221Parsi Panchayet Case, Suit 689 of 1906, pp. 81, 86 (hereafter PPC).222PPC, pp. 151–3.223PPC, p. 117.224Hinnells, ‘Parsi Attitudes to Religious Pluralism’, in H.

Her naujotewas performed and when she firstentered a temple in 1915 a court case ensued. Davar took anactive role in the dispute in his role as a trustee of the BPP, but inthat role he asserted that his own earlier judgement had declaredsuch acts illegal. The Burma court found in Bella’s favour, andquoted the 1906 judgement which had said that conversion hadbeen part of Zoroastrianism.225Caste was not a matter of discus-sion in the Burma court. The plaintiffs took the case to the PrivyCouncil in London, who overturned the previous ruling sayingthat the Trust Deeds of that specific temple had designated thebuilding for the use of Parsi Zoroastrians.It is important to reflect on the implications of these judge-ments. Although Davar interjected in the Burma case that theearlier case he presided over had shown that juddin naujoteswereillegal, he himself in the 1906 case had specifically said that asMrs Tata and the Rajput lady did not appear in court, the courtcould not rule on the claim. He further emphasized, as did JusticeBeaman, that all subsequent comments made by them both wereobiter dictaand were therefore not legally binding. The PrivyCouncil made the point that their ruling applied to one specifictemple and its trust deeds and did not have general application. Inlegal terms, it is, therefore, questionable whether these judgementshave universal application. They are referred to in contemporarydebates, but one might ask whether a 1906 case in British India isbinding in Independent India, and what its authority is in thediaspora.Some further relevant historical incidentsThere have been other incid-ents that complicate the issue further. On two well-publicizedoccasions numbers of people with a Zoroastrian father have beeninitiated, but there has been public protest because of the non-Parsi mother. The first pre-dates the 1906 court case. In 1882in Mazgaon eleven people, children and adults, were initiated, allthe nine elders having married out. Despite the involvement ofrespected priests, including Dastur JamaspAsana and Kukadaroo,there was widespread public protest, led by the BPP andthe scholar priest Dastur Sanjana.226Similarly in 1942 DasturParsis in Post-Independence Bombay121225This judgement was published by Parsiana, May 1990, pp. 32–6.226Desai,History of the BPP, p. 13, and Hinnells, ‘Parsi Attitudes’."},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"Minocher JamaspAsa (son of the one involved in the Mazgaonincident) and Dastur Bode performed the initiation of seventy-seven people, aged between 7 and 60, all with Parsi fathers whohad married out. There was considerable uproar and threats ofviolence.227These incidents show that in practice, both in thenineteenth and the twentieth centuries, Parsis often imposedstricter conditions than outlined in the 1906 case, and therehas been substantial opposition to the naujoteof a child of anyintermarried parent.Intermarriage and conversion at the end of the millenniumThe debate onintermarriage and conversion has been central to Parsi concernsfrom the mid-1970s until the late 1990s both in Bombay and thediaspora. It is therefore important to trace this debate, even ifindividual incidents can only be dealt with briefly. There havebeen few periods without some such controversy in the BombayParsi community, especially since the mid-1970s. A starting pointof this section may be taken as 1978 and what became known asthe Cama Baug episode.228A Parsi male was refused permissionby officials of the Cama Baug fire temple on Grant Road for hisdaughter’s initiation because he was married out. Court actionwas averted (on the alleged grounds of breaking the country’s law)when he was allowed to use another baug, but a low profile wasmaintained by not publicizing the event more than three daysin advance. It was at the same time that the split between theBPP and the Federation occurred, in part on the grounds thatthe Delhi Anjuman allowed non-Zoroastrian spouses into theirtemple and into Anjuman membership.229Clearly the trustees ofthe baug were acting more strictly than had been suggested in the1906 judgement by Davar.In 1980 the subject of the rights of intermarried womenbecame a matter of intense public debate, with the demands ofsuch Parsi ladies to vote in BPP elections; the CER came into exist-ence and were successful in their legal challenge on this question.At approximately the same time a prominent Parsi lawyer, HomiP. Ranina, published a pamphlet with a supplement written byParsis in Post-Independence Bombay122227Desai,History, pp. 159–61, pp. 338 f; pp. 296–301 of that publication are appendicesof legal advice given in the light of these incidents and judgements.228Parsiana, May–June 1978, pp. 18–25.229Parsiana, May–June 1978, pp. 26–37, interview with the Delhi President, ShiavaxNargolwala."},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"Dastur Kotwal. This stated clearly the Orthodox position onintermarriage.230Ranina argued that an appropriate analogy wasthe practice in breeding animals: one would not cross an Alsatianwith a Dobermann, and similarly one does not mix breeds ofhorses. In the supplement it is argued that marrying outside thefold is next to adultery, because the marriage is not solemnizedaccording to the rites and customs of the Zoroastrian religion,and that if a woman claims to continue her religion, this is hollowand hypocritical. Regarding the Special Marriages Act, in whichpeople are not required to reject their religion, Kotwal asserted‘I would like to stress with all the emphasis at my command, thatsuch a marriage has no sanctity in our religion.’ Any subsequentchild ‘is considered to be illegitimate’.Also in 1980, there was controversy over a proposed Adoptionof Children Bill. The then Prime Minister, Mrs Gandhi, intendedto pass a law enabling Indian citizens to adopt a child of any casteor religion and ‘to confer on the adopted child all rights, civil,social and religious of the adoptive father’. In a letter to the PrimeMinister, dated 9 February 1981, Dastur Dr H. D. K. Mirzaargued that the Parsis should be exempt from the bill because ‘itsapplication would threaten the very existence of the community’.Mrs Gandhi received a deputation of High Priests, and acommittee was established to produce an appeal document.231It argued that:A Parsi can be a Parsi only by birth and not by adoption or conversionor a non-Parsi adoption. Racial and genetic purity is a command ofReligion. Parsis left Iran to preserve their spiritual Institutions likeSudreh-Kushti...Fire Temples, Dokhmas, Death Ceremonies—andabove all the genetic purity, which is the very foundation of the Parsi life.It concluded:what is required is the preservation of the inherent genetic and racialcharacteristics along with all the spiritual gifts our prophet graciouslybestowed on us.Reforming Parsis, for example Nargolwala, also petitionedMrs Gandhi,232but the Orthodox petition was successful andParsis in Post-Independence Bombay123230Mixed Marriages Among Parsis—Can They be Justified?Bombay, n.d.231Special Committee for Adoption Bill of the Bombay Zoroastrian Jashan Committee,Adoption of Children Bill, 1980, Parsi Zoroastrian Point of View, published for private circulation,1980.232Parsiana, July 1981, p. 17."},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"Parsis were exempt. The episode indicates that whatever thegrounds given in the 1906 case concerning conversion, in theminds of traditional religious leaders in the 1980s the issue wasone of genetic, or racial, identity.

They state that they do not wish to subordinate any othergroup, but simply to be conscious of their identity, and diminish-ing in numbers though they may be, they want to preserve whatthey are.233Bombay and the Petersonnaujote The next high-profile publicevent on the intermarriage/conversion issue took place outsideBombay: the initiation in New York of a white American notof Zoroastrian descent, Joseph Peterson, on 5 March 1983. Thiswill be considered in some detail in the chapter on America, butit merits brief comment here because of the impact it had inBombay. This was in many ways a more dramatic event than theothers discussed above, in so far as there was no question of inter-marriage; rather, it was a straight issue of conversion by someonefrom a Jewish-Christian background. It attracted huge comment inthe Bombay press:Parsianareported the events and the opinions ofboth sides, the Bombay SamacharandJame Jamshedtook their oppos-ing Reforming and Orthodox attitudes (the Jamehad reported theplannednaujoteon 15 February). There were public meetings, withvarious associations speaking out on the matter; those opposing itincluded the BPP, two priestly bodies, the Cama AthornanInstitute, the Athornan Mandal, the Council of Vigilant Parsis,Zoroastrian Studies and the Jashan Committee. There were severalNorth American Zoroastrian priests involved in the naujote.Theone who spoke out on the issue most publicly, Kersey Antia fromChicago, was the target of particular attacks and was not allowedto speak at the ensuing World Congress in Bombay, and he allegedthat he was threatened with physical attack.234The three prominentParsis in Post-Independence Bombay124233See e.g. H.

Conversion as apractice, they contended, ‘has brought strife, destruction, devasta-tion and misery on mankind’. They warned that if proselytism waspractised in democratic countries, the position of Zoroastriansliving in non-secular countries ruled by religious heads could beendangered. The allusion to Iran was obvious. The significance ofthis event here is the impact that events in the diaspora can haveon Bombay Parsis. It is inevitable in a book of this nature thatchapters deal with the communities separately, but it is importantto note the interaction between groups in different countries. Forsome in the diaspora Bombay was seen as the centre of religiousauthority, which they looked to to condemn the Peterson naujote.236For others, Bombay represented a conservative body out of touchwith developments, especially in the modern West. The relationsbetween the old country and the new Associations is a theme whichwill recur below.The Roxan Shah casePerhaps even more contentious in Bombay than the Peterson naujotewas the case of Roxan Shah in 1990.237Roxan Shah was killed ina car accident on 27 July 1990.

He went on: ‘To marry outside thefold is next to adultery since the marriage is not solemnised accord-ing to the rites and customs of the Zoroastrian religion.’ Referringto the Avesta, he stated that a marriage between a Zoroastrian anda non-Zoroastrian ‘hurts and distresses Ahura Mazda’.

If there is a conflict between the legal positionand the religious view, the divine laws of God must prevail.The other High Priests, Dasturs Mirza and JamaspAsa, sup-ported Kotwal’s views on forbidding the dokhmafuneral of inter-married women, but were more cautious on Parsis ignoring thelaw of the land.240The legal question became important becausethe opinion was sought of the retired Chief Justice of India,Y. V. Chandrachud, and he asserted the right of women marriedunder the SMA to continue to affirm their own previous religiousidentity.241Some even argued that by choosing to marry under theSMA, such women were actually reaffirming their own religion.Thirty-two intermarried Parsi ladies then wrote to the BPP seek-ing assurance that, in the event of their death, their Zoroastrianreligious identity would be recognized and that they would begiven a dokhmafuneral. The argument was also advanced thatsince the families of intermarried men were not required toproduce an affidavit, the requirement in the case of women wasan example of gender discrimination, something contrary toIndian law.242Public meetings and letters to the three main Parsinewspapers and magazines continued for months. In an interviewwithParsiana, Kotwal reaffirmed his opinion that intermarriage ‘isan act of adultery in a strictly religious sense’.243Mobeds who hadhelped in such funerals ‘he described as “greedy” and derisivelylabelled their association with “rich, liberal-minded behdins” asa marriage of convenience’.244Kotwal then argued that, in hisopinion, men who had married out should also be excluded fromthe religious life of the community: ‘a Zoroastrian man who is united in marriage with a non-Zoroastrian, his religious life isParsis in Post-Independence Bombay127240Deen Parast, June 1991, pp. 4 f. where they argued that one must obey the laws of theland, even if one does not like them and campaigns to change them.

Even though the meetingmay not have been representative of the whole community, itshowed the strength of Orthodox feeling.245It caused debates inthe Federation, and 130 signatories published an objection to therights being given to intermarried women.246Some leadingOrthodox people, for example Homi Ranina, trustee of the BPP,who had opposed the BPP solution, wrote pamphlets against con-version and intermarriage.

An Orthodox priest fromLondon and a past president of the Zoroastrian Trust Funds ofEurope, Ervad Zal Sethna, performed part of the Zoroastrianfuneral ceremony (the gehsarna), before the body was laid to rest in aParis mausoleum.

However, on a visit to Bombay in1984, when he was fêted at the queen of the colonies, CusrowBaug, he made a speech which indicated the way his mind wasmoving towards his ancestral community. He said: ‘I firmly believethat it is the Zoroastrian religion with its very positive approach tolife instilled into you since childhood which is the basis of yourgood fortune. It is this which has given you the faith that you canachieve what you do.’ He went on to argue that the term ‘Parsi’denoted a race, and then speaking of his father and himself, said:Sir Ness was racially a pure Parsi, and I think very few Parsis would denythis fact—or disown him on account of his joining another religion.

He had first approached Dastur Kotwal, who had beenthe most vocal of the High Priests in the case of Roxan Shah.Initially Kotwal was doubtful on the grounds that Zoroastrianismdid not allow conversion. He suggested, however, that although anaujoteceremony would be inappropriate, a purification andrepentance purification bath might allow his ‘reappointment’ tothe Zoroastrian faith. Wadia said that ever since his return fromschooling in England:I have since then felt and have been accepted by the community as aParsee, irrespective of my religion. My own roots are purely Zoroastrian,and under certain circumstances which were beyond my control, thisdeviation has come into my life. So my desire is to come back into theoriginal Zoroastrian fold. I have always tried to follow the teachings ofZoroaster and act accordingly, especially in the Parsee community....For many years I have not only regretted that I am not a Zoroastrian,but had a strong desire to resume the religion of my ancestors, and I feltmore a Zoroastrian than the religion in which I was brought up. Eventhen...I have never gone into an Agiary, although I am very anxiousto do so, because I did not like to hurt the sentiments of the community.Wadia explained that his Zoroastrian friends in London andToronto had encouraged him to seek to have his naujoteper-formed. The two High Priests, Dasturs Mirza and JamaspAsa,noted the great services his family had rendered to the commun-ity.

In a further letter, Kotwalaccepted the suggestion of a naujote. He believed that Wadia’s case‘merits special consideration. Please note that I do not wish to setup a doctrinal precedent or generate a controversy.’Despite Kotwal’s intentions, the naujotedid cause a controversy.In the February–March issue ofParsianathe Orthodox priest ofBangalore reported ( pp. 3–4) on his discussions with the BombayDasturs and related how he returned to Bangalore a sad personbecause, he alleged, the naujotehad been agreed to as a ‘consider-ation for services rendered’. The controversy grew, with fierceattacks on the three High Priests, especially on Kotwal because ofthe apparent inconsistency of his stand over Roxan Shah and inthe Wadia case. The attacks were particularly strong in Deen Parast,a magazine with which Kotwal had been closely associated.254InNovember that year the four High Priests (Mirza, JamaspAsa,Kotwal and Dastur) published a rebuttal of the criticisms ofthem.255They stressed that Zoroastrianism forbade conversion ofpeople from other religions but allowed people to return to theirancestral faith. They also refuted the argument that initiationshad to be performed by the age of 15, even though it is nórmal toperform them before puberty. They concluded ‘that the presentcase is not one of conversion but of reverting to the ancestralfaith’. The issue was discussed at a Federation meeting in Delhi in January 1995. In the lively debate the chairman of the BPPindicated that it accepted the ruling of the High Priests.256Inthe correspondence columns of the various papers, manyZoroastrians expressed the view that it may have been proper forSir Ness Wadia, the father of Neville Wadia, to have returned tohis ancestral religion, but as Neville Wadia had been born intoParsis in Post-Independence Bombay131254SeeDeen Parast, Nov.–Dec. 1994, pp. 1–4; Feb.–Mar. 1995, pp. 2 f., 12; Apr. 1995, pp. 1f. 6; Dec. 1995, pp. 1–4; June–July 1996, pp. 1–3.

Indeed, it was pointed out that not only had NevilleWadia been born of Christian parents, and had been baptized,he had also married a Muslim, the daughter of Muhammad AliJinnah, the founder of Pakistan. So when Neville’s son, Nusli, wasinitiated on 8 October 1995, he was the son of a Christian fatherand a Muslim mother. This was seen as destroying the case forNeville Wadia’s naujotenot setting a precedent.257Neville Wadia,and his son Nusli, remained quiet during the disputes, but in aninterview for Parsianashortly before his death Neville spokewarmly of his return to his ancestral religion. Although he didnot go to the temple very often, he prayed daily and receiveda Zoroastrian funeral.258Perhaps inevitably the debate then turned to the question of therights of women who had married out under the SpecialMarriages Act, and who asserted that they had never left the reli-gion. Should they not be allowed the access to the religious rites,e.g. funerals, that Neville Wadia had been granted?259This themehas been pursued, largely in private, by some of the intermarriedZoroastrian women. On 27 November 1991, they had formallyestablished the Association of Intermarried Zoroastrians (AIMZ)and held their first meeting on 15 July 1992.260Its objectives wereto agitate for, protest in favour of and safeguard the rights, priv-ileges and benefits available to Parsi Zoroastrians married to thosewho were not Parsi Zoroastrians, and for rights of the children of such marriages. In 1996 they began to publish a newsletter,Aavedan. Here they reported that they had sought to have thequestion of intermarried Parsis discussed at the forthcomingWorld Zoroastrian Congress in Tehran; but the BPP said that thetopics had already been fixed in Iran and that it could not add tothem. Their support came not only from Bombay, but also fromAmerica.

At the time of writing a decision has not been made.The significance of these events is that the issue of intermarriage,and of conversion, has become more rather than less prominent,the debate yet more acrimonious, in recent years. That debate hasbeen noted with great interest in the diaspora. The initiationdebate has had a further dimension. As early as the 1960s reportsbegan to be received of Kurds and Yazidis claiming to beZoroastrians. They gained greater prominence in the 1990s.At the North American Congress in Vancouver (discussed inChapter 8), one of their representatives was invited to give a keypaper on his community. The debate has been strong in Mumbaialso. It has been particularly associated with Dr Meher Master-Moos, who has visited Central Asia where people fromUzbekistan and Tajikistan have made similar claims. Reactionshave been mixed. For some, these groups provide hope for thefuture of the religion, for their numbers are in the millions, notthousands. But others are more cautious: for if these people’s linkswith Zoroastrianism have been seriously weakened, then throughnumbers alone, and not through the ‘correctness’ of their beliefsand practices, they could have an adverse effect on what mostZoroastrians see as ‘real’ Zoroastrianism.263The issue of intermarriage again surfaced as a major publicdispute.Parsianaeditor Jehangir Patel informed me in a personalconversation in January 2003 that one in three marriages per-formed were, according to figures he had gathered, outmarriages.Six of the seven Dasturs decided to take a public stand and invarious newspapers (e.g.Jame, 23 March 2003) and declared thatParsis in Post-Independence Bombay133261Jame Jamshed, 12 Feb. 1995, p. 12.262Information supplied by the chairperson, Meher Amersey, during a meeting inJanuary 1998 in her home.263See e.g.Deen Parast, Aug.–Sep. 1996, pp. 11 f., and again June–July 1997, p. 3, andBombay Samachar, 21 Mar. 1993."},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"the initiation of the children of Parsi fathers who had married outshould not be initiated. They severely reprimanded what theycalled ‘the renegade priests’ who gave a blessing to such mar-riages. They accepted that intermarriages were civil contractsunder civil law, ‘However, marriage from the Zoroastrian point ofview is a sacrament and, therefore, such civil marriages maybevalid from the point of view of civil law, but such marriagescannot be considered lawful from a religious point of view.’ Theyasserted that intermarriages, and the initiation of offspring ofsuch marriages, were a ‘threat to the very survival of the ParsiZoroastrian community’;...ifthis trend continues, ‘the day is notfar when the unique “Parsi Zoroastrian” identity which the com-munity has zealously preserved since centuries will be diluted andsubsequently wiped out.’ A vitriolic dispute broke out, leading oneperson to describe the Dastur’s declaration as ‘the Talibanizationof Zoroastrianism’. Even Jehangir Patel, who had for yearsavoided involvement in religious debates, produced a severelycritical editorial of the declaration, recalling the approval of theDasturs to the initiation of Sir Neville Wadia (discussed above),who had been born of Christian parents. The ripples of thedebate spread throughout the diaspora. Even though I havealways refused to become involved in community debates, Ireceived telephone calls from several very anxious and some angryZoroastrians in the diaspora. Subsequently some of the Dastursrescinded their censure on intermarriages which followed the 1906law case, i.e. allowing the children of Parsi males to be initiated.Undoubtedly the debate will rage for many years to come.264This account of communal disputes in Mumbai may leave theimpression that intermarriage and conversion are the onlydebates in the community. They loom large, but are not thesole focus of discussion. There are other issues, in addition todokhmenashini. Some of the most widely debated have been notedParsis in Post-Independence Bombay134264For Patel’s editorial, see Parsiana, Apr. 2003, p. 1 and for an account of the furor seeParinaz M.

But the focus ofthis chapter has been on the debates that are not only importantin Mumbai but also in the diaspora; these are, above all else, inter-marriage and conversion. Intermarriage does occur in Mumbaiand is a matter of dispute there (see above on the AIMZ), but it isnot as common in practice as the arguments suggest. Where itdoes occur it tends to be among the highly educated and well-to-do. It is a feature of cosmopolitan groups, but not so commonamong Parsis living in the baugs.265It is such a contentious issuebecause it highlights a number of concerns. At a time when thefuture of the community appears numerically in danger, questionsof boundaries, of identity, gender roles and equality become ofmajor importance. The security of a ‘caste’-like group in earlierIndian society was greater than it is in a modern, urban, highlyeducated, socially and geographically mobile cosmopolitan soci-ety like Mumbai. As women achieve higher education and enjoyimportant economic professional roles, so they demand equalitywith their menfolk.ConclusionThere have been a number of changes in the course of the lasthundred years. At the start of the twentieth century Parsis wereaccused of being too pro-British, and many distanced themselvesfrom the wider Indian population, despite the public assertions oftwo political leaders, Mehta and Naoroji, that they were Indianfirst and Parsi second. With the end of British rule, identificationwith India politically and culturally has increased. This is evidencedin their religion also. The Reformist calls for the Protestantizing ofthe religion have not been so strong, and the emergence of theso-called new religious movements, and the devotion to suchfigures as the Babas, soften somewhat the religious divide. But thiscan be exaggerated, for in Gujarat over the centuries ParsisParsis in Post-Independence Bombay135265See H.

It is the westernizing of the religion that has declinedin Mumbai, as belief in miracles, miraculous figures and prayershas become ever more popular.In the early years after Independence Parsis were involved inIndia’s political life. The growing communalism at the end of thecentury, has not resulted in any persecution of Parsis, not even atthe time of the riots in the early 1990s. But the communalismwhich gives advantage to certain groups in education and jobs hasmeant that Parsis have had to work yet harder to succeed. Thisthey have largely done. Various demographic and sociologicalstudies show that they are an ageing, numerically declining com-munity, where deaths exceed births, where the older practice oflarge families has diminished with more people remaining single,and family sizes decreasing. Concerns over the shrinking size ofthe community have led to substantial efforts to improve the sup-ply of affordable housing, but not yet to much greater provisionfor the elderly. In comparison with the general Mumbai popula-tion, Parsis tend to have a higher material standard of living. Incontrast with the nineteenth century, they have perhaps fewerpeople with vast wealth, and more who are poor. Nevertheless, onthe whole, the community is middle class. A number are now ben-efiting from India’s growing industrialization, and it may be thatthe community is inclining towards business rather than the pro-fessions. As we shall see in the rest of the book, several thousandhighly educated Parsis have migrated overseas, but in Mumbaithere is a sense that the quality of those who stayed is high. Thereis pride that the main centre in the world for crucial Zoroastrianresources, Atash Bahrams and temples, madressas and the BPP,remains Mumbai. There is evidently still a deep commitment tothe religion. The level of practice has been shown by independentresearchers to be high and the interest, especially among theyouth, in the teaching of Mistree suggests a wish to know moreabout their heritage, be that through books, magazines, or tours toIran. The huge numbers attending the installation of the fire in theGodrej Baug is further testimony to the continued commitment tothe religion. Indeed, it is my impression that the Orthodoxmovement is stronger now than it was at the beginning of the lastcentury. The debates over the religion would not be so fierce if theorthodox commitment were not there. There is some evidenceParsis in Post-Independence Bombay136"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"of the influence of the diaspora over the community in Mumbai,partly in the debates over Peterson and the film Wings of Fire,butalso in the personal contact by telephone and letter and visits tofamily and friends in the new countries. The traffic of influencedoes not go in only one direction. Contemporary Mumbai Parsisare distinctive for their adherence to the belief in the miraculouspower of key prayers recited correctly and at certain times. Thereis also devotion to holy people, not just Zoroastrians. Also popularare general Indian religious practices such as seeking protectionfrom the power of the evil eye, and the use of figures from non-Zoroastrian traditions. The proliferation of the new religiousmovements is a common feature of urban religion worldwide, andthese attract some Parsis as they do followers of other religions.The debates which rage—sometimes an appropriate word!—are centred on three core issues: the preservation of traditions(e.g.dokhmenashini), community boundaries (e.g. intermarriage, andwho can and cannot be considered a Zoroastrian), and the demo-graphic problem—not only the declining numbers, but also thechanging role of women. In Parsi debates there remains a placefor dialogue with western academics: whether it is the collabora-tion between western and Parsi academics, or Parsis studying inthe West, there obtains a more positive and constructive dialoguebetween Zoroastrians and those who study them than is commonin the broad field of the study of religions.266Parsis in Post-Independence Bombay137266Of course there are exceptions. In Deen Parast, Jan.–Feb. 1997 there was an articlecriticizing ‘the craze for inviting foreign scholars’.

The text of thequestionnaire is included as Appendix 3. In Karachi, I sent outwhat had been intended only as a trial questionnaire for a widerstudy of Parsis; since that data proved so interesting, and the data-base was larger than for most trial runs, the data is included here.It may, however, be judicious to treat Karachi data cautiouslybecause of the real possibility of a skewed sample. For that reasonthe data is not discussed in a separate section in the chapteron Karachi. Nor is there a section on the survey in the chapter onEast Africa, because the communities there are so small. Lookingback over the recent history of the Parsi diaspora, this was afortuitous moment to have undertaken such a study. The 1980swere crucial years in various ways for the different communities:it was a period of consolidation in Britain, of growth and devel-opment in Canada and the USA, and the beginning of the growthperiod in Australia. In Kenya, by contrast, it was a period ofdecline, and a similar process was then developing in Pakistan.Hong Kong was awaiting the handover of rule from Britain toChina. By the 1980s the East African Parsis were making theirpresence felt, especially in Britain, and also in this period IranianZoroastrians were settling in western countries. It was therefore adecade of significant change. Freezing such a moment in time totake a snapshot of the community has historical value. It would befascinating to undertake another such survey to provide a longitu-dinal study. The survey was undertaken with the help of theAssociations in the various centres: in Canada and the USA thiswas organized by Perviz and Hushtasp Bhumghara. Respondentswere encouraged to pass forms on to fellow Zoroastrians whom"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"they knew who were not members of Associations, a snowballeffect that yielded a wide range of respondents. Ideally, of course,one would wish to ensure a balanced sample, but because there isno known universe, no central lists of all Parsis, and because thereis no obvious Zoroastrian family name, unlike Singh among Sikhs,checking electoral registers or telephone directories is pointless.The response rate varied from 25% in Britain to 90% of the thenknown membership in Sydney and Melbourne. The data was putonto the computer and analysed by Gillian Mehta and her family.Without them the work could not have been undertaken.1The data will be used in the chapters on the various countries,and in the Conclusion it will be analysed not by region but by‘type’ (gender, age, education, etc.). Prior to studying the historyof the growth and development of the various diaspora commun-ities around the world, it will be helpful to give a broad overviewof the population of the diaspora, as indicated by the frequency-distribution of the data, in order to give a broad picture of theglobal Zoroastrian population so that the distinctive features ofthe various Associations become clear.I must stress that I am not trained in quantitative survey work,2but it has proved to be a valuable aid to this multifaceted study ofthe Zoroastrian diaspora, alongside the archival and fieldworkthat have gone into this study. The 1,840 responses to a question-naire with over 170 variables provided a substantial, and so farunique, set of data on living Zoroastrians.Some Demographic PatternsOne-fifth of my respondents had migrated before 1965, so thatthere was a significant proportion of long-established people inthe diaspora.

Of the 1,076 respondents with children, mosthad families with two children (44%); only 2% had four or morechildren. So although most people were married with children,globally the diaspora community was not at reproduction level.Unlike many South Asian groups in the ‘West’, only a quarter(24%) were part of an extended family network; 63% belonged toa nuclear family and 14% were single.Language and educationAlthough only 21% said that they considered English theirmother tongue,4more people could read and write only in English(38%), than could in Gujarati (32%) or Persian (5%). This reflectspartly the westernized nature of the Parsi community in the oldcountry, and the very high levels of education among diasporaZoroastrians. Only 4% of respondents completed their educationby the age of 16; 46% studied for a degree, and a further 30% fora higher degree, 48% of them in the West. Globally, there wasa roughly equal proportion of arts and science graduates (34%and 31%), but, as we shall see, there are different patterns in thevarious western countries.Questions of identity and networksNetworking in the ‘global community’ was strong, with 64% keep-ing in regular contact with Zoroastrians in other countries, and73% in such contact within their country of residence. But morethan half of respondents (57%) did not read any Zoroastrianpapers or magazines; by far the most widely read was Parsiana(by 12% of respondents). Approximately one in three respondentssaid that they attended a Zoroastrian centre in their country regularly for religious, social or communal functions, and a further40% did so sometimes. Only 11% said that they never visiteda centre, and in most cases that was because there was no centrenear them.

The great majority(84%) said that they ate Indian or Iranian food often (less than 1%said that they never ate such food); relatively few (20%) said thatthey wore Indian or Iranian dress often.

Belief in the traditional prayers for the dead alsoremained strong. But the diasporic population did not share theviews of co-religionists in Mumbai about the importance ofdokhmas, and was more open to the idea of intermarriage than arepeople in any of the old countries. Most saw themselves as beingliberal in the religion, but the Orthodox voice was present. Veryfew believed that the priestly or secular leaders in the old countryhad any authority over them, nor did many recognize the author-ity of their own local leaders, but rather preferred to follow theirown conscience.

Opium had long been a legal part of Chinese medicine, aslaudanum was part of British medicine until the twentieth century;indeed, opium was used as a recreational drug in Britain in theeighteenth and nineteenth centuries. But smoking it was illegal inChina. The story of the British trade is long and complex, andsubject to various interpretations. From the contemporary Britishperspective the trade was necessary to acquire purchasing power;it was a growing trade, increasing by 2000% in the period 1799 to1849. By 1876 it was estimated that 26% of the total revenue ofthe British Government in India was derived from the opiumtrade. The economic links between Hong Kong and India wereclose, notably through shipping lines, traders and banking. By1881, 86% of the island’s trade with India was in opium, until thetrade was banned in the early twentieth century.3The Chinese authorities rated traders as lowly persons, andrequired British traders to deal only with Hongs, regardless of thestatus representatives had in British eyes. The splendidly titled‘Superintendents of Trade’ held little status among the Chineseand they were not allowed to meet Mandarins. The Chineserestricted foreign activity to specified areas: near the port ofCanton traders were restricted to Shameen island during the trad-ing season, with larger sea-going vessels anchored down the riverParsis in Hong Kong and the China Seas1483Perhaps the best study of the background to Parsis in the opium trade (though theyare mentioned in passing rather than being the subject of the book) is M.

The traders were required toretreat to the island of Macau for the non-trading season, or goback home. The prominent English firms in the region, JardineMatheson and Co. and Dents, were fierce rivals. They dealt withmany smaller traders, both at the supply end (Bombay andCalcutta in particular) and at the distribution end along the coastof China. The attitude of the British was that if the Chinesewished to ban opium, then it was their responsibility to imposeand police the ban. But the demand in China was such that sup-pliers, Chinese users and middlemen would always be availableand so the British did not hesitate to pursue the business. Initiallythe Chinese authorities had considered legalizing the trade,but opposed it from 1837. At a meeting of merchants and thoseinvolved with trade to China in London that year, concern wasexpressed to find a base in Canton where merchants could livewith their families, and under British law. They also resolvedto find an island base off the coast of China ‘where [the] Britishfactory may peacably reside, subject to laws of its own Governmentand removed from all collision or dispute with Chinese subjectsand authorities’.4In 1839 tensions were high between the British and the Chineseauthorities, and an Imperial Commissioner, Lin Tse-hsu, was sentto stop the trade. The Mandarins and the police made ready thesquare in front of the foreign factories to execute a Chinese manfor trading in opium. The chairman of the general Chamberof Commerce protested to His Excellency the Chinese Viceroy ofCanton that the square had been kept for the factories for manyyears and this event meant that ‘the square was fitted with manythousands of the lower classes of people’, so that rioting mightbreak out and property be damaged. In his reply the Viceroy saidthat the man had been tried and sentenced to death by strangula-tion because of the pernicious introduction of opium into Cantonby ‘depraved foreigners’. The land in front of the factories hewent on, ‘is all the territory of the celestial empire, and is merelygranted by the great emperor, from motives of extraordinarygrace and clemency as a temporary resting place for all theforeigners’, and of the protest he said: ‘No daring presumption,no absurd complainings can exceed this.

Ifthey refused they would be sent away. Future landings would onlybe allowed if such a bond was given.6The practice had been tokeep the sea-going schooners at Whampoa and for smaller vesselssailed by Chinese smugglers to take the opium into China. TheEmperor then made a proclamation making Lin Tse-hsuGovernor of Canton with strict orders to stop the smuggling ofthe opium that was destroying the lives of many Chinese, simplyto make money for foreigners. Individual Chinese who destroyedtheir opium and gave up their pipes would not be prosecuted.7Linarrived in Canton on 10 March 1839 and in a lengthy proclama-tion, dated 18 March, he declared that all chests of opium instorage in the ships or factories must be handed over for burning.If more ships came in the future, the cargoes would be confiscatedand their crews put to death. But if the opium was handed over,past misdeeds would not be punished. China was self-sufficientand neither needed nor wanted foreign trade that was solely forthe interest of foreign merchants; if necessary the port of Cantonwould be closed.8The merchants protested that the opium wasnot theirs to hand over, but belonged to merchants in Bengal andParsis in Hong Kong and the China Seas1505Quoted in J. Slade,Narrative of the Late Proceedings and Events in China, Canton, 1839,pp. 3A–D. Slade gives a lengthy detailed contemporary account of this and the subsequentacts involving Commissioner Lin. His considerable collection of documents and theexchange of letters forms the basis of much of the following account of the episode involv-ing Governor Lin. It is also based on a contemporary British summary of the followingincidents contained in the Jardine Matheson archive at Cambridge University Library ( JM A8/121/30). I am grateful to Jardine Matheson and Company for giving me permis-sion to study this archive, and to the staff of Cambridge University Library for alerting meto it, and for their considerable help in enabling me to consult it. Greenberg,British Tradeand the Opening of Chinais based largely on this archive. In part the archive contains originalletters and documents, and some is on microfilm. The archive is not yet fully indexed.Despite the fact that some letters are illegible, and there is much overwriting, a more thor-ough study of the several thousand pieces of correspondence relating to Parsis is merited.There are, for example, nearly 2,000 letters of Sir Jamsetjee Jeejeebhoy and Sons in theletters file, and nearly 800 references to Bomanjee and Ardaseer Hormasjee. Many ofthese are simply straightforward commercial letters, yielding little information for generalParsi history, but it remains an inadequately researched archive from the Parsi perspective.6Letter dated 16 Jan. 1839, Slade,Narrative,p.11.7Proclomation published in the Peking Gazette, 21 Jan. 1839, Slade,Narrative, pp. 13–15.8Slade,Narrative, pp. 27–31."},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"Bombay. They did, however, say that they would not bring opiumagain and many, including the leading houses of Jardine andDents, said that they would discourage others from bringingopium in the future. Lin responded by banning anyone fromleaving Canton (by refusing to allow the essential pilots to guidethem along the estuary), and confined merchants to their factories.He said that if all the opium was not handed over, he would‘select for execution one or two of the most unworthy of theirnumber’, from among both British merchants and the Hong.The merchants met with the Hong to discuss how many chestscould be handed over as a token and agreed on 1,000, but it wasdecided that the Hong would not pay for them since that wouldresult in their decapitation because they would be purchasingopium.Admiral Sir Charles Elliot, the Superintendant of Trade,imediately went to Canton to conduct negotiations. On Sunday at9.00 a.m., native servants working for the merchants were orderedby Lin to leave and were forbidden to supply food or coolies tohelp the merchants. Troops surrounded the British consulate andall boats were taken away. Eventually, on 27 March Elliot, accept-ing responsibility on behalf of the British Government, handedover 20,283 chests of opium,9but ten people were kept underguard until all negotiations concerning present and future tradewere settled. They were eventually allowed to leave on 23 May.Lin stated: ‘we, the commissioner and governor, have reverentlyembodied the heaven like benevolence of the great emperor andremitted the punishment of their offences.’ But he went on, if theyever came back, ‘their offences shall surely be punished with sever-ity. There shall certainly be no renewed leniency or indulgence.’10The merchants petitioned the British Foreign Minister, LordPalmerston, to ensure the security of future trade. In a letter tohim and the Privy Council dated 1 June 1839 the merchantspointed out that the opium trade was ‘encouraged and conductedby the Government of India’, the trade was ‘under the expresssanction and authority of the British Government, entirely forstate purposes, in this way the Government have derived an enor-mous revenue from it, latterly two million sterling per annum.’11Parsis in Hong Kong and the China Seas1519A chest contained 135–60 lb of opium.10Slade,Narrative, pp. 105 f.11Ibid., pp. 139–43."},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"After the Lin incident the British traders did not trade opium atCanton, but withdrew to Macau and used others to smuggle theopium into China.12In a parliamentary debate in 1843 Lord Ashley proposed thesuppression of the opium trade. He maintained that ‘the continu-ance of the opium trade and the monoply of its growth in terri-tories of British India is destructive of all relations of amitybetween Britain and China.’ But the counter was that this wastrue only if opium ‘continues to be contraband’. Negotations, itwas reported, were taking place between Sir Henry Pottinger andthe Chinese which might lead to the legalization of the trade: ‘Inwhich case, opium could not harm amity between England andChina.’ The opium trade was ‘worth £1,200,000 per annum tothe Indian Government and this is a large sum of money whichcould not be obtained from any other source without offendingsomeone in India’.13The British attitude was, in short, that itwas the Chinese responsibility to control their own smugglers, butthat the best solution was for them to legalize the sale of opiumbecause this would remove animosity between the two countries.Britain could not stop the trade because it needed the money.The Commissioner Lin incident highlighted the general prob-lem of the British in the region, the lack of their own base. Thiswas needed not simply for security and storage of goods (notablywarehouses for opium), but also for legal reasons. While Britishtraders were at Shameen, and other trading centres, they were notsubject to British law, nor effectively controlled by Chinese law.A British base could be subject to British law and people’s conductregulated to some extent. Because of the piracy common in theregion, it was also important to have a safe harbour for vessels.The British had taken possession of Hong Kong when Elliottraised the flag there in January 1841. The British Government wasdispleased with this possession of what the Foreign Secretarydescribed as ‘a barren island with hardly a house upon it’.14Elliottwas removed from office and summoned home in disgrace (thoughhe appears to have been reinstated in official esteem later).Elliott’s successors in Hong Kong grew to appreciate his fore-sight.

The colony was subject to many problems. Themaintenance of law was difficult, with the Governor having fewresources to impose regulations on traders, who viewed its direc-tions as a nuisance. Pirates at sea and brigands on land made thegrowing colony no more secure than the ‘Wild West’ in America.Health was also a problem, as plague and diseases associated withpoor sanitation in a tropical climate were prevalent. Within thisbeleaguered British colony, class and rank became of considerablesocial significance. Status was determined by birth and profes-sional position, with boundaries perhaps even more sharplydrawn than in Britain. The clubs, and dress codes, of London lifewere replicated in Hong Kong. The boundary between the Britishand the ‘Orientals’ was especially strong, although some EurasianIndians did mediate between the British and the Chinese.15War and money marketsThe 1842 war with China was not the last. Hostilities wererenewed in 1857, and settled by the Treaty of Tientsin in 1858(ratified by the Convention of Peking in 1860). This gave access toten more Chinese ports and allowed a settlement in Canton. Thewider access to Chinese ports and markets made the need forHong Kong less clear and the island entered a period of relativeobscurity. In 1866 there was an international run on the banks.Jardine Matheson and Co. were able to sell their investments priorto the collapse of the market because of the extremely swift pas-sage of one of their boats warning them of the impending disaster.Dents were not so fortunate and the firm eventually collapsed,leaving Jardine Matheson and Co. as the only British Hong. Thecollapse also led to the closure of several banks. Of the first elevenbanks in Hong Kong, nine had been leading Indian banks, theChartered Bank of India and the Oriental Bank, for example. Butin 1864 the idea grew of having a bank with local priorities, localshare support and local directors. One of the concerns was thatbanks in China might, like their Indian predecessors, be ‘lured’ toLondon and lose their local concern. As other banks fell in theParsis in Hong Kong and the China Seas15315H. Lethgerbridge,Hong Kong:Stability and Change, Hong Kong, 1978, pp. 163–88;J.

AlthoughHong Kong in the 1860s was struggling with various bankingproblems, health and safety issues, and a relative eclipse in favourof other ports, nevertheless the Chinese, and the non-Chinese,populations were growing. In 1862 there were 3,034 non-Chineseand 120,477 Chinese in the island; in 1895 there were 10,828non-Chinese and 237,670 Chinese—as the Chinese populationdoubled, the non-Chinese trebled.17This would, of course, haveincluded an unknown number of Indians, but it may be assumedthat a substantial proportion were Europeans, especially becausethis was the time of the crash of the Bombay Stock Market, whenIndian businesses closed and many of their overseas members hadto return to India. In 1898 the British Government agreed a leasewith the Chinese of an area of the mainland (Kowloon and the‘New Territories’) for a hundred years. The British had beenreluctant to acquire more land, but the activities of the Russians,Japanese and Germans in the area made them fear for their secu-rity in Hong Kong. An area of the mainland was thus acquired toestablish a base to protect Hong Kong from the threat of recentlydeveloped artillery. It was the expiry of this lease which led to thehandover of Hong Kong to the Chinese in 1997, for althoughHong Kong island had been ceded in perpetuity in theory, inpractice it could not be retained separately from the NewTerritories because of its dependence on them (for drinking water,for example).The twentieth centuryIn the period 1850–1950, British foreign policy in Asia wasdominated by Indian interests. Hong Kong trade continued todiminish, owing particularly to the growth of Shanghai and thenSingapore, which left Hong Kong as something of a backwater.The Second World War, or the Pacific War, began the change inHong Kong’s status. The Japanese captured Canton in 1938, butthe British were then cautious about helping the Chinese, beingconcerned at the prospect of two fronts in the war, with GermanyParsis in Hong Kong and the China Seas15416See F.

The attack on Pearl Harbor,the landings in Malaya, air raids on Hong Kong, the sinking ofthe battleship Prince of Walesand the battle cruiser Repulse, allwithin a few days in December 1941, changed the political situa-tion dramatically in the Pacific. It was recognized from the outsetthat Hong Kong was indefensible, but the British Governmentencouraged its people to fight to the last, street by street. However,the British forces surrendered quickly in December 1941, seeingthe position as hopeless and anticipating that such action wouldavoid mass destruction. Thousands were raped, many killedbrutally, particularly doctors and nurses at a hospital where theBritish had a supply depot. The British were put in prisoner ofwar camps. Food and basic supplies were short throughout theentire occupation. The Chinese, who at first thought they hadlittle quarrel with the Japanese, suffered as much as anyone.Whereas the Indian communities in China had not been suspect,they were in Hong Kong, because they were thought to haveco-operated with the British. Hong Kong was not seen as a majorfront, so the elite Japanese forces were deployed elsewhere and thepeople in Hong Kong were badly treated by the less professionalJapanese soldiers. The eviction of the Japanese from Hong Kongin 1945 was soon followed by the march of the People’s LiberationArmy across China. Within a few years Hong Kong’s populationincreased by 400%; although most were Chinese, a number wereIndians who had been told to leave China.From the mid-1950s Hong Kong industry began to flourish, notleast through the activity of some of the new arrivals, especiallythose from Shanghai. From the 1960s its economy grew dramati-cally, and by the 1970s financial stability enabled substantialspending on education, health, living accommodation and trans-port. There were fears that the revolutionary fervour of the main-land would spread to Hong Kong, but these concerns over Chinawere balanced by a consciousness of the overriding importance oftrade with China and the investment potential. In the 1980s theBritish Government negotiated the handover of the colony back tothe Chinese. In Hong Kong there was a feeling that deals werebeing set up without the involvement of those who would haveto live with the consequences. Many, especially people from India,or those of Indian ancestry but born in Hong Kong, feared fortheir future in Chinese Hong Kong and sought reassurance fromParsis in Hong Kong and the China Seas155"},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"the then British Prime Minister, Mrs Thatcher, that their Britishpassports would give them right of entry and settlement in Britain.She refused, and the Labour opposition did not argue. The situa-tion became more fraught in June 1989 when student protests inTiananmen Square in Beijing were brutally put down. Hong Kongpeople feared that similar ruthless treatment might be meted out tothem after the handover. In July 1990 full British passports, grant-ing the right of settlement, were given to the heads of 50,000 fam-ilies to whom it was thought special consideration was due becauseof their contribution to Hong Kong. This was not well received bysome sections of the Conservative and Labour parties. After the50,000 heads of households scheme was finalized it was realizedthat there were still several thousand people in Hong Kong ofIndian, Pakistani, and Nepali origin who did not qualify for UKpassports under the scheme. The British ‘passports’ which did notgive the right of entry to Britain effectively left such people state-less after 1997. A pressure group, the Indian Resource Group, ledby young Sindhis, but including a Parsi, mounted a campaign bothin London and with Chris Patten, then Governor of Hong Kong.On a visit to Britain Patten persuaded his long-standing friend,John Major, then Prime Minister, to accept the rights of moreHong Kong citizens to settle in Britain. These measures in practiceappear to have slowed down the rate of migration, for people werewilling to stay so long as they knew that they could leave if itbecame necessary. Despite some display of potential militarypower by the Chinese at the time of the handover, in the followingyears the armed forces have not been in evidence on the streets ofHong Kong, civil and religious rights are now being respected and,the tourist trade apart, much Hong business continues, indeed inparts flourishes, in the specially administered region within theChinese nation that is Hong Kong.Parsis in ChinaSurvey data of Hong Kong Parsis in the 1980sAppendix 2, Table 1: 1–35 tabulates the data collected from myglobal survey. At the time of the survey there were approximately120 Zoroastrians in Hong Kong. The sixty-six responses thereforegave a response rate of approximately 50%, unusually high forParsis in Hong Kong and the China Seas156"},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"postal surveys. Nearly one in four respondents were born in theregion, a far higher proportion than in most countries (save onlyKenya and Pakistan). The majority of Zoroastrian residents inHong Kong were born in India. But again, like the older centresof Karachi and Kenya, Hong Kong yielded a substantial propor-tion of respondents (one-third) who had moved there prior to the1960s. It was, therefore, a settled community. In terms of agestructure, there were more people over the age of 55 (30%) thanin most diaspora communities, except in London, which had avery similar age distribution to Hong Kong. The American,Canadian and Australian Zoroastrian populations were muchyounger. The Kenyan Zoroastrian population was older, for rea-sons which will be discussed in Chapter 5. Hong Kong was one ofthe few centres surveyed where women outnumbered men. Likethe other older centres, Hong Kong had a relatively small numberof single persons, and a small (but growing) number of intermar-rieds. There was a large proportion of people with no family inthe region. As far as education is concerned, a relatively highproportion of people completed education at school level, fewerthan in the rest of the diaspora undertook postgraduate study, andrelatively few studied science. A high proportion of people werenot in employment (it is reasonable to assume that these wereretired persons, not people unable to get work). A high proportionof people held managerial positions, but there were relativelyfewer in executive posts. A slightly smaller proportion of respon-dents than from elsewhere in the diaspora corresponded withZoroastrians overseas regularly, but a higher proportion were inregular contact with Zoroastrians locally.18More Hong KongZoroastrians said that they read Zoroastrian literature than didrespondents in most diaspora communities.The figures for religious practice are difficult to interpret.Slightly fewer respondents in Hong Kong than elsewhere saidthat they prayed daily, or wore sudreandkustior ate Indianfood, but the differences between centres were so small that itwas difficult to attach much significance to them. The percentageof Hong Kong respondents who described themselves as Parsis in Hong Kong and the China Seas15718It was stressed in Chapter 3 that the Karachi sample was small, since the survey therewas seen only as a pilot study. This was one of the instances where the sample is almostcertainly skewed, for the questionnairè went out mostly to the active members of the community."},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"non-practising was fractionally higher than in most other diasporacommunities, yet the numbers saying that they celebrated thegahambarswere slightly higher. The difference here could be that,as there is easy access to the Zoroastrian building, more attendedthe functions there. Further, in this old centre a number of theearlier settlers have endowed funds for gahambarsto be observed intheir memory, facilitating social functions with food and drink.Although Hong Kong respondents generally did not assert a beliefin the different forms of the after life, in comparison with othercommunities, they nevertheless tended more than others to affirmthat prayers for the dead are essential (see Appendix 2, Table 1:27–8). The explanation for this is probably that the Parsi cemeteryin Hong Kong is not only accessible by transport, it is also part ofthe communal consciousness, because their full-time priest goesregularly to the cemetery and performs the prayers for the dead.They were, therefore, more aware of death ceremonies thanrespondents in, say, the scattered groups in North America. As faras funerals were concerned, more respondents said that theywanted a funeral in a Tower of Silence than did respondents fromother communities, save only for Karachi. The ties with Indiawere emotionally close, and it is not as long a journey from HongKong as it is from North America to the dokhmasof Bombay; thesefacts probably explain the answers to the question on funerals (seeAppendix 2, Table 1: 21). Another factor may also be the higherproportion of older people in Hong Kong than in, say, America.Fewer Hong Kong respondents than those from America, Canadaand Australia approved of intermarriage, but they were not asopposed as the other, older, settlements of Britain, Karachi andKenya (see Appendix 2, Table 1: 33–5). However, they shared theIndian opposition to non-Zoroastrians being allowed into temples,another marker of the closeness with India. Along with Sydney, ofall the diaspora groups, Hong Kong respondents were most likelyto assert that community relations there were good. They alsoasserted that external relations were good, and fewer of thembelieved that they faced discrimination (see Appendix 2, Table 1:35–7). Broadly, therefore, the survey showed a pattern similar tothose of the older diaspora settlements (Karachi, Britain and EastAfrica) and somewhat different from the ‘New World’ of Australia,Canada and the USA. The broad picture was of a close commun-ity aware of its ties with India, but not especially religious.

But the nature of that trade is unknown.19There are various references in the columns of the Parsi Prakashtoother Parsis trading in the region: two drowned at sea in 1768;Edulji B. Edulkaka made his first trip in 1775; D. M. Readymoneymade his first visit in 1779 and H. E. Cama made the first of hisand his family’s many trips in 1786.20There are various indica-tions, such as details in obituaries in the Prakash, or businessnotices, that there were a number of Parsis engaging extensivelyin the opium trade. A contemporary source puts the figures of Parsisin the trade at 200, but that source had reasons to exaggerate.21This early trade was all based at Canton.

Although this is the first reference to a Parsi in the region, Zoroastrianstraded with China at least as early as the Sassanian period. But that is part of a totallydifferent trading history, hence in this paragraph the emphasis on ‘Parsi’. In the referencesto the China trade I am indebted to the late Mr Jamshed Pavri, originally of Hong Kong,later of Vancouver, who taught me much during my stay as house guest with him and hiswife, Roda. Mr Pavri generously allowed me to consult the notes he had made overthe years. I am also indebted to to Ervad Rustam Ranaji Pavri who was the priest inHong Kong during my first visit there, and who went through all the Parsi Prakashindexedreferences to Parsis in the China Seas with me. With the permission of the Association healso read with me the minute books and Anjuman files, a labour which took many daysand for which I am deeply grateful. In subsequent visits the Association kindly permittedme to work through the more recent records on my own.20PPI. 108. Mr Pavri’s personal notes record that Eduljee Bomanji Edulkaka first wentto China in 1775 and spent nearly thirty years there. His source is not identified. He statesthat Hormusji R. Chinai made his first visit to China in 1793. Another early trader wasHormusji S. Dolakhau in 1775, who thereafter made thirty visits. Hormusji Cama’s firstvisit in 1786 was undertaken with Edulkaka. Merwanji M. Tabak made his first visit in1790, and took Jamsetji Jijibhoy with him on his 1799 visit. The Parsi said to have visitedChina most often was Jamshed J. Porter, who died in 1837 having made forty-two visits.Greenberg,British Trade, is focused on the role of the British, but in passing he makes anumber of references to the numbers and importance of Parsis in the trade (see pp. 32, 78,60(2) 55, 49(1), 84, 89, 93, 114, 119, 127, 130, 137, 146, 150, 160, 173).

He made the first of his five visits in 1799; the otherswere in 1802, 1804, 1805 and 1807. His 1805 trip was the mostdramatic. He published an account of it in the Bombay Courier.23His vessel was captured by two French ships. He, together witheight Muslims and four English passengers, was taken toMadagascar, where all were accused (falsely) of conspiring to killa Frenchman. When they arrived at the Cape of Good Hope theFrench admiral refused to let them take any of their merchandiseoff the vessel, allowing them only the clothes they stood up in.After much suffering and lack of food they eventually secureda passage on a Dutch vessel going to Calcutta, where J J was ableto obtain money from his office for the journey.

But J J was not intimidated by such powerfulfigures; he was prepared to reject opium that was not of sufficientquality.29He was also prepared to take the initiative in businessventures: for example he informed Jardine that he had decided toput their jointly owned clippers up for sale, because they could notcompete with the newly introduced steamers.30The Jardine archive shows not only the extent of the tradebetween J J and Jardine Matheson and Co., but also the numberof other Parsis trading with this prominent company in the 1820sand later, notably Jamsetji Byramji, Ruttonjee Edulji,31HormasjiBomanji,32Ardashir Hormasji,33D.

I need scarcely remark that such treatment offers us noinducement to enlarge my operations.’ In another letter he says:‘I dare say this has not escaped your attention and I trust mybusiness will receive more careful attention.’39Nevertheless, sub-sequent letters show that Eduljee was shipping some 1,400–1,700chests per voyage to Jardine Matheson. In the early part of 1867he sent 4,250 chests of opium in three steamers. His trade wastherefore substantial.40Further Parsi involvements in the opium tradeThere are other indications in diverse sources of the extent ofParsi involvement in the opium trade from the early days. Therewere seven Parsi signatories to the petition of Canton traders tothe British Parliament, 24 December 1830, urging governmentaction to stop Chinese efforts to block the opium trade.41Similarly, on 10 August 1834 a letter to Napier demanding actionagainst the Chinese was signed by twenty-four Parsis.42Napierconvened a meeting on 25 August 1834 with twenty-four mer-chants, to draw up plans for a Chamber of Commerce; eight ofthe merchants attending were Parsis, and one, Dadabhai RustamjiBanaji, drew up the rules and regulations. These references indi-cate the importance of these Parsi merchants in the local trade.43Parsis in Hong Kong and the China Seas16238See for example the letter of JJ dated 21 Aug. 1824, letter 12, reel 17 B6/4/1-271,letter 13, 31 July same year and reel. 15 Mar. 1848, letter P (51), reel 58; 7 May 1848, letterP54, same reel.

WhenElliott temporarily solved the situation, fifty-four Parsi merchantsmade a collection to send a thanksgiving charitable donation on22 September 1834 for the poor people of the village of Udwada,where the oldest and most revered of holy fires is housed. Theinformation suggests that there were altogether approximatelyseventy Parsis in Canton at the time.44But even this figure mayunderestimate the numbers. For in 1829–39 alone, fifty Parsis arerecorded as shipping opium to Magniac and Company.45In 1837 a huge fire engulfed Surat. When news reachedCanton, there was a collection raised among the Parsis, as in othercommunities. For such a cause one might reasonably assume thatall the Parsis would donate, so the list of contributors is important.Forty-seven names are specified, with the tantalizing phrase ‘andothers’. There are eight new names.46Two years later (23 January1839) William Jardine left China for Britain and forty-seven Parsissigned an address and contributed to a gift of ‘plate’. There areseven new names.47Jardine stayed in Bombay on the return voy-age and was there fêted in the home of J J, when many merchants,predominantly Parsis, made a collection to honour him.48The Parsis were deeply involved in the 1839 Lin incident relatedabove.

Not all profited.Several businesses in China were bankrupted by the collapseof the Bombay stock market in the 1860s, but the actual tradein China itself was not always profitable, as Sir J J comments in a letter in the Jardine Matheson archive.59The purchase price,shipping and agency costs were not always covered by the pricesobtained on the market. Nevertheless, several leading Parsi fami-lies owe the basis of their wealth to the opium trade. By the 1860smany of them were diversifying. Jardines began to move out ofopium in the face of rivalry from Dents, and by the 1870s thetrade was dominated by the Sassoons. Companies who dealt withJardines, such as Sir J J and Sons, also turned to other markets, forexample silks and cottons.Parsi institutions in CantonWhen the story of the Parsis in the China Seas is commented onat all, for example by Vaid, it tends to be from the perspective ofthe Hong Kong community.60But the oldest Association, and fordecades the most important, was in Canton. The first firm therewas established in 1794 by Cawasjee Pallanjee, but it moved toHong Kong in 1841.

The first ‘community’ gathering was held at the officesof Dadabhai and Maneckjee Rustamjee Banajee, whose firmwould keep the records, and their aim was to raise funds for theperformance of religious ceremonies and for charitable aid to theneedy. They collected $8,678, from sixty-three named individuals.The major donors were Cama and Co. and Modi and Co.62Fourtrustees were appointed. The first Parsi to die in Canton wasF. M.

The first Parsi to be buried in Whampoa Parsi cemetery was NusserwanjiJ. Batiwala, who died at the age of 21 on 14 Sept. 1867. The records show the followingdates recorded in the cemetery: 1847, 1849, 1850 (2), 1851 (3), 1852 (2), 1855, 1859, 1918.Of these deaths only five were of people over the age of 40, the early deaths being apointer to the unhealthy conditions. The fact that there were only twelve deaths in seventyyears indicates that there was no settled community. The ‘residents’ simply came for tradeand returned to their families in India.64The donors included Dhunjibhai Neheramjee Rana; Nusserwanji Bomanjee Modi;Cowasjee Sapoorjee Langrana and Ruttonjee Hormusjee Cama.

The CantonParsis collected funds for the establishment of burial grounds inother centres, notably Singapore in 1829, and Shanghai in 1854,but also at Hong Kong and, of course, Canton itself.

The Canton Association flourisheduntil the Second World War, when its assets were transferred toHong Kong.ShanghaiIt is somewhat easier to give a connected account of internalcommunity affairs in Shanghai, because it produced its ownhistory covering the period 1854–1935, which consists basically ofa summary of the community’s annual reports.67Such primarysources are both invaluable and somewhat skewed. These particu-lar records are unusually frank about the community disagree-ments, with details of the subject matter and names. But there areinevitably areas in which they are reticent. Generally they makelittle reference to the external political situation in China and thecommunity’s relationship with the Chinese. They are also discreetabout the recipients of their charity.

The details aboutreligious belief and practice, or social functions, are scanty.68There are occasional uncertainties about the dates of changes, butgenerally the records provide a connected picture of the ‘institu-tion’ of the community. Unfortunately this record gives little indi-cation of the role of the Parsis in Shanghai. I have been able totrace only one reference to a Parsi in non-Parsi Shanghai records:D. Burjorji was the only non-European at a meeting on 11 July1854 at the British consulate to draw up municipal regulations andto establish a police force to oversee their European settlement.69This indicates a significant social staus for Burjorji amongEuropean traders.The Anjuman grew out of an original meeting of three or fourtraders who had moved there from Hong Kong to open branchesfor opium, cotton and cotton yarn in 1847. With the growth offemale education, and more freedom, women began to travel withtheir husbands and so the community became more settled andincreased in size. By 1934 it had grown to 124 people—sixtymales, thirty-one females, thirty-three children. By 1934, sixty-one Parsi children had been born in Shanghai, and there werethirty-five deaths in that period.70The first physical developmentwas the purchase of fenced land for burial, in what was thena suburb of Shanghai, with money donated by the Canton Parsis.Collections from members on religious festivals facilitated thebuilding of a proper wall and land levelling in 1857. In 1862Dorab N. Cama built a gate with a room over it for religiousfunctions. In that same year it was decided that the local Parsiresidents should buy out the share of the Hong Kong and CantonParsi Associations, which was agreed, with the proviso that if theground was sold the money should be remitted to Hong Kong. The‘declaration of independence’ was largely triggered by a letterfrom the Hong Kong trustees alleging mismanagement of Trustfunds. Thereafter the cemetery was run by the ShanghaiAssociation, led mainly by representatives of the Cama and Pallonjifirms, with Dadabhai Burjorji taking a leading individual role.Parsis in Hong Kong and the China Seas16868For example, the records refer in passing to ‘Parsee indoor and outdoor clubs’. Onemay surmise that the former would be for card games and billards, judging from othersocial centres, but beyond that nothing is known.

In 1866 a building with a library waserected. It was some twenty years before income reliably exceededexpenditure. The administration of the Trusts was difficult becauseof the frequent resignations of trustees as they were leavingShanghai (e.g. p. 18, with reference to 1891). From 1896 thecommunity began to send more regular charitable donations tothe needy Parsis in Bombay. They remitted their general excess ofincome over expenditure,71with 5% to non-Zoroastrian causes,mostly poor local Chinese; a portion of the rest was for IranianZoroastrians, but donations were made mainly to Parsis in India.The few charities which are specified are for education and, espe-cially, medicine. The scheme for the regulation and managementof the Trust was laid down in November 1872. Para 7 states thatthe first use of such money should be for cemeteries forZoroastrians in any place ‘in China, Japan or elsewhere in theFar East’. Thereafter it was for ‘the relief and support of pooror indigent persons of any caste creed or nationality’, and finallyfor ‘any other religious charitable humanitarian or benevolentpurpose’. The maximum for Zoroastrian religious benefactionwas 1,200 taels and 300 taels for non-Zoroastrians (p. 187).72By 1899 the number of Parsis was increasing, so that anadditional floor had to be added over the old prayer hall. TheAssociation was subject to a number of internal disputes at theturn of the century focusing on the redrafting of the Trust Deedsand the administration of business. It would appear that thesedifficulties arose in part from the fact that the members were notaccustomed to running community Associations, but, being suc-cessful businessmen, were accustomed to asserting themselves—hence the growing pains of a new Association! Another recurringproblem was the admission of non-Parsis to community-ownedproperty, namely the cemetery and associated gardens which wereused for social meetings and festivals meals. At a special meetingin 1910 (p. 34) it was agreed that: ‘No person or persons otherParsis in Hong Kong and the China Seas16971This could be quite a substantial sum. In 1934, one of the few years where this isdetailed, the sum given in charities was $10,496 (p. 156).72The AngloChinese Kalendarfor the year 1834, p. 32, states that 720 taels were worth$1,000 Spanish."},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"than members of the Parsee community shall be permitted tomake use of the said Cemetery or buildings in its enclosure.The said buildings are to be used for religious or other purposesaffecting the welfare of the Community.’ The meeting also agreedto make a handsome donation to the Parsee General Hospital inBombay, subject only to the condition that Shanghai Parsis begiven the same benefits as any Bombay Parsis.73The investmentsof the community increased by approximately 350% in the years1912–1974and discussions ensued on the use of this money. Thefirst proposal to be agreed (23 December 1918, pp. 53 f.) was fora social centre for feasting and ‘auspicious communal occasions’(61). This meeting and a later one (26 February 1919) rejected theexpenditure for a priest and decided to continue using the volun-tary service of local Parsis of priestly descent (pp. 54–8). It isevident that a full-time priest was employed within a few years, butthe exact date of his appointment is not specified.75At a meetingon 31 March 1921 the community voted to donate charitable helpto the Hong Kong community, which was having difficulty meet-ing its costs, a reversal of its status in the nineteenth century (p.66).76Similarly, in 1922 the community made a donation to thebuilding fund in Canton. There are occasional suggestions of aidto other Zoroastrians in the China Seas, for example, allowingthe priest to travel to other centres to perform initiations, but theParsis in Hong Kong and the China Seas17073Hospitals appear to have been a focus for such charity. On 13 Apr. 1898 a donationwas agreed to the Masina hospital, though the Trust deed meant that, as it was not acharity exclusively for Parsis, the donation was smaller, though on reconsideration on2 Nov. 1913 this was increased five-fold. A larger donation was made on 6 July 1913 (p. 42)to the Dorabji N. Mehta Parsis Maternity Hospital fund in Navsari and on 23 Dec. 1918a donation was agreed for the Parsi fever hospital (p. 52). The only recorded non-medicalcharity donations were made to the Yazd Girls’ High School in 1918; the Bombay Fundfor the relief of poor Parsis in 1918 (p. 51); for Parsi families injured in the riots followingthe Prince of Wales’s arrival in Bombay in Dec. 1921, (p. 72). On 26 Jan. 1926 a grant wasagreed for a Zoroastrian school in Iran (pp. 93 f.). Page 86 notes that each year they hadmade (relatively small) donations to local Chinese hospitals. There is also a reference toannually agreed lists of charities; none are specified, and no percentages are given, thoughalmost all were said to be Zoroastrian. Only 500 taels total per annum was allocatedfor all non-Zoroastrian charities, which was the amount given in a single donation toa Parsi hospital.74From 83 taels in 1912 to 51,689.59 in 1919 (pp. 42–64).75In Hong Kong note files I found the date 7 Mar. 1919 but it is not clear if this wasa full-time mobed or someone else taking over the duties part-time.76A further donation was made in 1924, but after much argument it was agreed thatthe Hong Kong Association should first seek the support of some of its own wealthymembers (p. 82)."},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"records suggest less inter-Parsi contact in China than one mighthave expected.77Foreign trade had grown in Shanghai since it had become oneof the treaty ports in 1843, but it grew particularly in the late1920s when Nanking became the capital. The Parsis benefitedfrom this, with their investments more than doubling between1919 and 1925, and then more than doubling again between1925 and 1934.78This enabled them to increase their land hold-ing. In 1932 they built a new prayer hall, and a new funeralground a year later.79The community funds were such that thefine new building was paid for out of income, without loans or anyindebtedness. The president in his speech on that occasionexhorted the community to make frequent use of it:and he further beseeched the ladies to grace all such holy and happyoccasions with their presence and attend in large numbers all the Jasanceremonies and such other religious rites with their children so thatfrom their very childhood their little beloved ones might be saturatedwith a strong love for their religion, and a reverent and righteous feelingfor a spiritual life and clean life, and be inspired with love and respectfor their elders and ancestors. (pp. 139 f.)This speech, inevitably somewhat flowery on such an occasion,may suggest that concern for the transmission of religion andculture was stronger than the recorded minutes indicate. But theyalso point to the place of women in the community. By the initialTrust Deed, voting at AGMs was only for men aged 21 and over(and they had to have lived in Shanghai for the preceding threemonths, p. 192). Women had not been mentioned as being pres-ent previously.80This raises the question of the place of women inthe community, not least with regard to the purity laws. The onlyParsis in Hong Kong and the China Seas17177In August 1925, for example, the priest’s assistance was requested in Kobe (p. 87) andin July 1926 Parsis in Tientsin and Peking sought financial assistance for a cemetery(pp. 96 f.).

In Parsi terms, this almost certainly means thatthere was concern that during her menstrual cycle the wife wouldbe seen as polluting the religious environment, an issue which willrecur below in relation to the Hong Kong community. Apart fromduring menstruation, the social involvement of the women andtheir attendance at religious functions appears to have beenencouraged, yet was also a matter for comment. The same puritylaws, it has been noted, meant that non-Zoroastrians could notattend religious functions, but they were welcome at social events.The Parsi club, like most such centres around the diaspora, wasfor card games, billiards, table tennis, reading Bombay papers,and community gossip.By 1927 there were the early signs of external politicalproblems. At a meeting on 26 January 1927 (pp. 98 f.), doubt wasexpressed about buying further land ‘in view of the uncertainpolitical situation at that time’. In that same meeting the trusteesdiscussed reinvesting their main funds, which had hitherto been inthe bonds of the Shanghai Municipal Council, ‘but as a strongagitation was going on amongst the Chinese population to takepossession of the Foreign settlement’, they sought communityopinion on what they should do ‘in case of emergency and if thepolitical situation grew more serious’. It was decided to seek theadvice of the British Consul. His reply ‘had not taken any alarm-ing view of the situation, and though his reply was couched in acalm and peaceful tone, the general opinion prevailing amongstthe members of the community was that it was not advisable tohold on to these investments any longer’ (p. 101).By 1932 concerns were increasing. At the AGM on 16 March aParsi resident of Hong Kong expressed the deep gratitude of hisco-residents to the Shanghai trustees for the accommodationgiven them in Shanghai, ‘when the Japanese troops occupied thatdistrict, and bombarded it, partly destroying it’ (p. 132). At aspecial meeting a month later doubts were expressed about agree-ing to the request for the priest to go to Hankow to perform aninitiation for fears for his safety, ‘owing to the political unrest, andwar clouds threatening to burst out in North China, [the speaker Mr Viccajee] saw great danger to life and property lurking in thatParsis in Hong Kong and the China Seas172"},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":"area’ (p. 133). So, balancing the increased prosperity of the Parsis,was a growing sense of external political danger. The ShanghaiParsis did not suffer in the war as much as those in Hong Kongdid, because in the former city Indians were seen as fellow Asians,whereas in Hong Kong the Indian communities were seen as col-laborators with the British. But when the Communists took overChina in 1947, the Parsis (estimates suggest about 120 persons)had to leave, some moving to India, and others to Hong Kong,which becomes the centre of attention for the rest of this chapter.The Chinese authorities took over all Parsi properties, includingthe graveyard, despite protests from Bombay and the Britishembassy in Peking.81Parsis in Hong KongThe early yearsOpium was not the only business in which Parsis were involved inthe China Seas. Although Parsis traded in cotton and other goodsat Canton, much of the wider trade was conducted in HongKong. There are glimpses in the records of other pioneeringParsis. One of the first to succeed outside opium and banking wasDorabji Naoroji, who went from Bombay to Hong Kong as acook. His bakery became well known and he moved into the hotelbusiness, owning several establishments including the prestigiousKing Edward Hotel, one of the most famous hotels in Asia. Heis better known as the originator of the Star Ferry, the flotilla ofships transporting people between Hong Kong Island andKowloon on the mainland. It is said that the business began whenDorabji lent his boat to family and friends to cross to Kowloon.Demand for its use was so heavy that he purchased a second boat,Morning Star. The ferry service began commercially in 1880; by1890 four boats were in operation, averaging 147 crossings perday.82By the beginning of the millennium the crossings betweenHong Kong and Kowloon, and various other places, are toonumerous to count.Parsis in Hong Kong and the China Seas17381Information supplied in a private letter dated 24 Oct. 1987, by Jamshed Pavri.82Hong Kong Standard, 24 Oct. 1984."},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":"Parsis had a role in the growth of banking in Hong Kong.Because much of the China trade was conducted throughBombay and other Indian ports, Indian banks were active in theearly years of the trade, notably the Chartered Bank of India andthe Oriental Banking Corporation. Parsis had been important inthe development of these banks. When the Hong Kong andShanghai Bank was formed in 1864, Parsis were on the planningcommittee and on the first board of directors of the new bank.They were Pallonjee Framjee and Rustomjee Dhunjeeshaw ofP. A. and P. F. Cama. Dhunjeeshaw had to resign in 1865, becauseof the declining fortunes of the Camas, and Framjee left thecolony in 1866.83It is interesting to note which names did notappear on the list of directors, notably Sir JJ and Sons. They weretoo closely allied with Jardines, who were kept off the board of thebank by Dents, a major force in the growth of the bank. Thisillustrates the problem of Indian merchants, even firms as large asSir JJ and Sons, when their major partners were caught up inpersonal and trading rivalries. The Camas did relatively littletrade with Jardine Matheson and Co. and so could be linkedwith the bank.84Also linked to the bank, but not a director, wasH. N. Mody, again, not a Jardine person. Mody moved quite earlyin his business career from opium to land investment, especially inKowloon. With Sir Paul Chater he formed the Hong Kong LandCompany, a firm which still owned much land at the end of thetwentieth century. Later Mody developed the Hong Kong ShareMarket and Stock Exchange. He became more of a figure onthe social scene than most Asians were able to, and ownedrace horses, racing being a major interest in the island;85he wasthe first president of the Kowloon Cricket Club, laying the foun-dation stone of the new pavilion in 1908, a role normally the strictpreserve of the British;86in 1912 he opened a charitable sailors’and soldiers’ home in Hong Kong.

Unfortunatelyhe died between the time when the foundation stone was laid(March 1910) and the opening in September 1912.87The Hong Kong Parsi community began as an offshoot of theolder Canton Association. After the British took possession in1841, a number of Parsis moved there. As Vaid remarks, it isimportant to note the difference between Parsis who used HongKong as their main base, and others based in Shanghai or Cantonwho used Hong Kong as a branch office.88The names of the lat-ter may appear in subscription lists, etc., but it was the former whodeveloped the Anjuman and contributed to Hong Kong life. Oneof the earliest firms to move their base from Canton to HongKong was Cowasjee Pallanjee and Co. in 1841. The first action ofthe Anjuman was the acquisition of a cemetery in 1845. (A newbungli, or place for funeral ceremonies, was opened at the ceme-tery in 1931.) In 1861 a religious building was opened, followed bya Parsi club in 1871. The original building was disposed of in1923, and a new one opened in 1931, which was extended withan upper floor in 1970. This in turn was replaced by a new build-ing in 1993.89Behind this bare list of dates for properties lies amore complex history of the Association in Hong Kong.Formally, the body is known as the Incorporated Trusts of theZoroastrian Charity Funds of Hong Kong, Canton and Macau.Canton has already been discussed. Macau was the base whereParsis stayed outside the trading season in Canton. It alwaysretained the character of a place of rest and recuperation, with,for example, a rest house and gambling facilities. The first Parsifund-raising in the China Seas region took place in Canton in1845, to buy a property in Macau.90This was sold in 1939because it was rarely being used.91Hong Kong was originally Parsis in Hong Kong and the China Seas17587B.

At the AGM on 8 April1930 a vote of thanks was passed to the Shanghai community fora loan to help them in their economic troubles. This was repeatedin successive years. Indeed in 1934 the Hong Kong funds weretransferred to Canton, and the administration of those funds washanded over to Canton in 1937.92Hong Kong Parsis and the Pacific WarThe Ruttonjee family flourished in the provision trade, especiallyin liquor.93Hormusjee Ruttonjee started as a wine merchant inHong Kong in 1886 and his son, Jehangir, established the HongKong brewery. This passed into Japanese hands during the war,but when it reverted to the Ruttonjees after the war they sold it toSan Miguel breweries. Jehangir also diversified into housing, it issaid he had 1,000 tenants and his flats were used by Parsi refugeesduring the war.94In 1948 he funded the building of a TB sanato-rium, with a final donation of $1.3 million in memory of hisdaughter Tehmina, who had died of the disease. It became amajor centre of treatment for people throughout South East Asia.The hospital was staffed with Catholic nuns from the IrishColomban Sisters until 1988. In 1956 Jehangir gave a substantialdonation for a convalescent home for patients to recuperate aftertreatment for tuberculosis, in memory of his second daughter,Freni, who died of cancer in 1953. In 1994 the then Governor,Chris Patten, opened a new hospital as part of the redevelopmentof the sanatorium, which had outlived its usefulness. Althoughfunded by government, like most Hong Kong hospitals, the newhospital was named the Ruttonjee Hospital in recognition of thefamily’s history of support for medical causes.95This Hong KongParsi (indeed widespread Parsi) tradition of charitable support formedical work has been continued by another notable member ofthe Parsi community, Shapurji Fakirji Jokhi.Parsis in Hong Kong and the China Seas17692AGM file, 12 Jan. 1938.93Vaid,Overseas Indian Community,p.55.94G.

Perhaps themost famous benefactor, although intensely shy, was ShapurjiJokhi, mentioned above.97He was imprisoned for eleven months,kept in solitary confinement, tortured and sentenced to death forsupplying food and medicine parcels to British prisoners. Shortlybefore his impending execution he had a dream that he would beset free and vowed that if he were, he would build a housingcolony back in his native Navsari. When a new commandantcame to the camp he reviewed all the death sentences and askedJokhi if he had indeed supplied such parcels and why. Jokhi saidthat he would do the same for a Japanese prisoner because hisreligion required him to feed the sick. ‘We are’, he said, ‘Asiaticreligious people.’ The commandant, a religious man, was movedand commuted the death sentence to imprisonment, and threemonths later Jokhi was released. He had always been a religiousman (a follower of Khshnoom), and spent most of the rest ofhis life funding a large colony in the name of his mother and hisrecently deceased wife. The first block of flats was opened inApril, 1973 with seventy flats, the second building in December1981 and a third in the mid-1980s. They are designed to providesubsidized housing for some 2,000 poor and middle-class Parsis.While in hospital in Bombay he saw how much the ParseeGeneral Hospital needed help, and gave generously to it.98A wingof that hospital was dedicated to him in 1995, following furtherconsiderable donations from his estate after his death.99Other Parsis known to have been tortured were Behram C.

The Japanese suspected they wereBritish spies and so they, and a visitor, Minoo Master, werearrested. All three were tortured and badly beaten. Minoo Masterwas released after two months, and the others after three months,but Patel died from his injuries. In Hong Kong two brothers, theKotwall brothers, were executed.100One of them, Jimmy, hadbeen a BAAG (British Army Aid Group) agent, helping people toescape and supplying medicines to people in the war camps. Hewas entrapped by a fellow Indian. Another Parsi, Sir RobertKotwal, acted as spokesman for the Chinese during the war, whenhe was known as Lo Kuk-wo. This is said to have been at therequest of the British, though some thought that his compliancewith the Chinese went further than his position required. Hewas later suspended from duty and investigated by the British,but cleared.101He never presented himself as a Parsi becausehe was practically excommunicated from the community when hemarried a Chinese wife, and he never had further contacts with theParsi community after he was refused permission to see his father’sface at his funeral because of his marriage out of the community.The post-war periodAfter the Second World War and the Communist takeover inChina the Parsis, like other Indian groups, were given a year toconclude their affairs and leave the country. Some were able totake their movable property and funds with them, but manyobviously lost much because they were unable to obtain reason-able prices for their properties. Some returned to India, but mostmoved to Hong Kong, which therefore became the largest centrefor Parsis in the region. After the Japanese capture, the dispersalof funds in Hong Kong was more difficult, and the Anjuman’sproblems were increasing. The bank investments became of littlevalue and some were transferred because of fear of them beingParsis in Hong Kong and the China Seas178100My main source is the oral reports in the community, but see also E.

Securities were withdrawn from banksand kept privately. Not only was the brewery occupied, but theJapanese Commander in Chief took over for his residence BuxeyLodge, the former home of Sir H. Mody, which had been giftedto the Anjuman by his widow. Many were made homeless.Individuals found themselves with little or no income, so themembers of the Anjuman who still had any money paid into afund to help the less well off.102Even in the early years after thewar, the Anjuman’s funds were in dire straits so that the AGM inMay 1949 was told that they did not have sufficient funds even topay the priest. The situation was saved by a communal collection.By 1950 the economy of Hong Kong was improving and with itthe fortunes of the Anjuman, enabling repair work to be carriedout at the cemetery, and to the Zoroastrian building. Shelter wasgiven to some Parsis who were still in personal crises. By the AGMin May 1959 the financial position was described as ‘very sound’.In the following fifty years, the Parsis of Hong Kong grew inwealth, paralleling the growth of Hong Kong in general. In the1980s, as concern grew over the return of Hong Kong to China,a president of the Parsi community wrote to Mrs Thatcher seek-ing reassurance that their British passports would entitle them tosettle in Britain. In a written reply, the Prime Minister’s PrivateSecretary, David Barclay told Noshir Pavri (who had beenawarded the MBE for his services to the colony), that all people ofthe British dependent territories ‘who have acquired Britishnationality, will be eligible to retain a status after June 1997 whichwill enable them to continue to travel on British passports, andwhich will enable them to seek consular protection while in thirdcountries. It is not, however, the intention to grant holders of thenew status the right of abode in the United Kingdom.’ In short,they were told that they could go anywhere, providing they did notcome to live in Britain!103In the ten years leading up to the handover of rule in HongKong from Britain to China, the Parsi community in Hong Konghad actually grown from approximately 150 to 200 because peoplewere redeployed there by multinational firms.

Whereas the originsof the community lay in trade and business, by the 1990s itwas becoming predominantly professional. The offspring of thesuccessful business people were sometimes following in the familybusiness, but more often they were pursuing higher education,especially overseas. Most of those who travelled overseas for sucheducation stayed there in the professions, but some returned aslawyers, doctors, etc. There was also a new type of arrival, Parsiswho had been successful in the employ of multinational compan-ies being moved to Hong Kong for their parent company. Suchpeople may stay for many years, but there is a sense that they aremore transient than the descendants of the old families. In partthis is for pension reasons. There is no old age pension scheme inHong Kong. To stay on after retirement requires ownership ofproperty—which is very expensive in the crowded island—andsubstantial financial resources. The elders of the successfulbusiness firms rarely retire fully, but for pleasure and for reward,continue business on a smaller scale. Successful professionals,lawyers for example, can earn larger salaries in Hong Kong thanin most other countries, but this is rarely sufficient to live on in fullretirement. The community, therefore, has two dimensions to it—the old business families and the generally young or middle-agedprofessionals. The older families live in flats in the same building,in three cases originally built by the family, so that there is a strongsense of community feeling. There is a third group, of unknownsize, of younger staff employed by Cathay Pacific, especially flightattendants, who have little direct contact with the community.These different social groups also have different profiles. Thosewho have been educated abroad are more likely to have marriedout of the community. When I made the first of my three researchvisits to Hong Kong in 1984, none of the older families had anymember who had married out. When I returned for my third visitin 1998, there was hardly a single family in the colony withoutone member married out. This has been a strong trend since themid-1980s. It means that the strict guidelines followed only tenyears earlier were being questioned, as will be seen below.There has been relatively little debate in the post-war period onthe running of the Anjuman, other than whether a woman couldbecome a trustee. Although this had long been mooted inShanghai (but never acted on), it was rejected at several meetingsParsis in Hong Kong and the China Seas180"},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"in Hong Kong.104It was eventually accepted in 1989, when onewoman was permitted to become a trustee. The debates on thebuilding focused more on who could enter it, when, and to whichparts non-Zoroastrians could go. There was a married priest for atime, but the Orthodox members were concerned about thepurity laws during his wife’s periods of menstruation. In the opin-ion of some, the problem was made worse by the fact that thefloors were wooden, a porous substance in terms of the puritylaws, unlike concrete or especially marble.105Non-Zoroastrianswere allowed into the building for social occasions, and intothe prayer room when a ceremony was not being performed. Theproblem was distinguishing between a religious and a socialoccasion in terms of the seasonal festivals, the gahambars, when thecommunity meals are viewed as religious functions, especiallywhen they had been endowed for that purpose. As intermarriagebecame more common in the post-war years, the question of thepresence of non-Zoroastrians became more difficult, because itmeant that spouses could share the meal when it was a whollysecular occasion, but not at the gahambars. This has not been solvedat the beginning of the century. Members report that spousesunderstand and accept this, but that was not what I was toldby the spouses themselves in private. Their point was that one ofthe cooks was a non-Zoroastrian, left-over food was given to non-Zoroastrians (a traditional act of charity), but yet they as spouseswere excluded. Which community boundaries to preserve, whenand where, is a fundamental issue for diaspora communities, rais-ing both questions of principle and severely practical problems.The major event for Hong Kong Parsis in recent years has beenthe erection of a new building. This has more implications thanParsis in Hong Kong and the China Seas181104For example at a special meeting following the AGM on 1 Nov. 1978. The vote wastwenty-seven for change, thirty-seven against. It was again discussed on 3 Apr. 1981 ata special general meeting. At an EGM on 28 Nov. 1989 it was agreed that there should beone woman trustee, and Mrs Ruby Minoo Master was elected.105Hong Kong AGM, 13 Nov. 1964. The problem came in an unexpected manner.The community had always appointed single priests, despite the fact that marriage is areligious duty for priests and lay people in Zoroastrianism, because of the practicalproblems raised by the purity laws. But in 1964 the existing priest informed the trusteesthat he was returning to Bombay to get married and would be bringing his wife back withhim. As she was past the menopause this did not present such a problem in her case.Thenormal solution was to seek a widower of mature years, and one divorcé was appointed.The problem of the porous wooden floors and the purity laws also emerged when thebuilding at the cemetery was being renovated.

A lift was mooted, but found to be expensive. A majorcause of doubt was the imminence of the handover of the colonyback to China, and fears that the community’s future underChinese rule would replicate conditions on the mainland, whenthey had been compelled to leave after the Communist takeoverand property had been lost. However, at an extraordinary generalmeeting on 6 June 1990 the vote for proceeding was overwhelm-ing (forty-eight votes for, ten against). The financial case had beenwell prepared. The fact that the Anjuman already owned the landwas significant, for it is land, not erecting a building, which isexpensive in Hong Kong. So the old building was demolished, thecommunity rented a hall for meetings for two years and the newbuilding was opened on 21 March 1993. The building wasfinanced partly out of reserves, partly from a bank loan. But thetwenty-eight-storey building has only the third to sixth floors forthe community; the rest are rented out, generating a substantialincome which was estimated to recover costs within an eight-yearperiod. A 100% occupancy rate was quickly achieved, raisingan annual income of eight million Hong Kong dollars. The loanwas paid back early by selling some share investments, and soall the income is now available for the community. Not onlydoes this ensure a healthy financial situation for the Anjuman, italso facilitates considerable charitable activity. At the turn of themillenium occupancy of the building has fallen to approximately50%, but nevertheless income exceeds expenditure. The volatilityof global financial markets evident in the early years of the newmillennium and doubts about the commercial failure of HongKong (and its rivalry with Shanghai) has raised the concerns ofmany Parsis regarding their future.The Anjuman had long engaged in charitable work wheneverits income exceeded its expenditure. There has always been somecharitable giving to poor Hong Kong Chinese, not least to theSisters of Mercy, the order started by Mother Teresa. But the bulkof the charitable work, as with Shanghai, had always been back inIndia. The largest donation had been to the building of theGodrej Baug in Bombay, but the lengthy delays and disputes overParsis in Hong Kong and the China Seas182106e.g. at an EGM on 12 June 1989."},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":"the allocation of flats had caused unease about similar fundingthrough the BPP. At the end of the millennium the priority wasfor medical charities for Bombay Parsis, notably the ParseeGeneral Hospital.107Inevitably there is concern that too muchpublicity will trigger too many causes which do not have suchmerit. There is a general, unwritten, agreement, that funds shouldonly be given to other diaspora groups where they are also fundingthemselves, and where there is harmony. Consequently, appealsfor help from Associations which are known to be seriouslydivided have been turned down. Self-help is a central part of theAnjuman’s ethic. Thus loans rather than grants are given to Parsisfor studies, to be repaid out of income when in employment. Theemphasis is on social concerns, health and education for poorParsis, rather than religious projects, though I was told that it isunlikely that if any of the great temples was in desperate need itwould be turned down. In private of course, there areconsiderable debates and some ‘arm twisting’. This incomemeans that in terms of resources per head in the community,the Hong Kong Anjuman is the richest Zoroastrian community inthe world. It is determined to use that money wisely.The new building has, inevitably, raised some of the issuesdiscussed earlier about priests’ wives living on the property, aboutwomen at religious functions during menstruation, about non-Zoroastrian spouses at religious functions. So far there has beenno change.The Anjuman’s Perceptions of Itself, of Others, and of the FutureWhen the Council of Hong Kong’s Indian Associations petitionedthe Governor in Council (18 January 1985) on the matter of therights of Hong Kong’s 6,000 Indians to use their passports to settlein Britain, they stressed how much the Indians had contributed tothe Colony: four Indian merchants were present at the raising ofthe British flag; Indians served faithfully in the Civil Service andin the forces, not least in the Pacific area; they founded theParsis in Hong Kong and the China Seas183107So at an EGM on 27 Aug. 1997, it was agreed to donate one million rupees ‘tothe Bomanjee Dinshaw Petit Parsee General Hospital, Mumbai, for the upkeep of thehospital’s totally free medical care for the poor’. On 2 June 1997, HK$800,000 was givenfor a new building for the Yazd Education Trust, a Parsi school in Maharashtra."},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"Star Ferry; started the University; built the Seamen’s Institute;donated the statue of Queen Victoria; opened the first banks,including the Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank; and have donatedschools and hospitals to the Colony.108Although the Parsis had notbeen involved in that petition, and are not active in the Council ofHong Kong’s Indian Associations, in fact it was they who hadbeen the leaders in each of the contributions to Hong Kong spec-ified in the petition. In practice, the Parsis do not see themselvesas part of the Hong Kong Indian community. Their links withParsis in India are close. Geographically, it is easier for them toreturn to the old country than it is for Parsis from Britain andespecially from America, so most do go back at least on alternateyears. The focus of their charitable giving indicates a deep senseof their links. And yet in conversation, many have said they do notthink of themselves as Indian. If for political reasons they had toleave Hong Kong, I was told, few would go to India. There is nosingle obvious destination: some prefer Australia because of theclimate and the Pacific rim links; some prefer America as a landof opportunity; but a number specify Britain, especially now theyhave British passports. The fact that Hong Kong has so recentlypassed from British control means that their links with the UnitedKingdom are closer than are those of many Indian Parsis. But inthe early years of the third millennium, the situation in HongKong is seen to be stable and few contemplate leaving.Again in private conversations in 1998, many Hong Kong Parsiscommented to me on the changes that are taking place withinthe community. The first is the gradual shift from a business-orientated community to a professional one. Although a few childrenhave gone into the family business, they, and other siblings, areseeking higher education in the West,109and from this experienceare moving into the professions as noted above. As other profes-sionals are being deployed by their multinationals into Hong Kong,Parsis in Hong Kong and the China Seas184108Petition to His Excellency Sir Edward Youde, GCMG, MBE Governor in Council,submitted on behalf of the Council of Hong Kong Indian Associations by its secretary,K. B. Rathi. The Associations named are: the India Association, the Indian Chamber ofCommerce, the Hindu Association, the Hong Kong Indian Women’s Club and the KhalsaDiwan. It mentioned in passing the Zoroastrian (Parsee) Club but did not say that it wasthe Parsis who had made most of the contributions.109Only one young Parsi has attended Hong Kong University. The pressure for placesis huge, and the demands for learning of a traditional kind are such that many prefer theatmosphere of a western university."},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"so they too are tilting the scales somewhat towards the professions.In the 1990s there have been five Parsi firms active in business, andmore are involved in service industries, for example in insuranceand asset management. Some of the older businessmen are onlysemi-retired and keep their concerns moving. One consequence ofthis western education is that almost all of the old large familiesnow have at least one member married out. The current priestat the time of my 1998 research visit was not willing to performthe initiations of children born of intermarriages, and in this heshared the views of the trustees. But his term of office was comingto an end, and quiet discussions were taking place about the view-points that would be appropriate in a new priest. In fact the newpriest held similar views to his predecessor. The wording of somerecent benefactions for community meals had been changed sothat intermarrieds could attend. There was a general acceptancethat the rate of intermarriage would increase. There are a numberof children under the age of 12, but few between 13–20, so manyyoung Zoroastrians consider that the chances of finding a spousethere are remote. Only a few are willing to visit India to seek aspouse. An increasing proportion assume that they will meet theirspouse through higher education or in their career. The youngerZoroastrians do not meet socially very often. The new buildinghas a room for children to play in while their parents are at‘the club,’ but it is a club for the older people: meals, drinks, cards.The only function each year specifically for children is theChristmas party. There are no religious education classes. Whenasked why there was no provision for the children’s religiouseducation, most people said that travelling across the island, thebusy business and social lives they lead, means that few would par-ticipate if these activities were organized. Some younger parentsexpressed in private their concern that the children were not madeto feel valued at the club.The views expressed in private about the future of thecommunity varied. Most considered that the situation would notalter much in the next five to ten years. Many people thought thatthere would be no dramatic change for even longer. The ChineseGovernment had promised that little would change for fifty years,and while it was seeking the handover of Taiwan to the mainland,most of my informants thought that change would not be dramaticin Hong Kong. Some believed that Hong Kong was a key economicParsis in Hong Kong and the China Seas185"},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"factor in Chinese growth, but others thought that as Hong Konghad declined when other cities like Shanghai grew at the startof the century, so this could happen again. Most were of theopinion that in the face of globalization and of the entry ofChina into world markets, the time of the small entrepreneur inthe import–export trade was disappearing, except in specialistmarkets. Business people may, therefore, become part of largerconcerns rather than simply run the traditional family business.Few saw the prospect of a Parsi community beyond fifty years.A feature of Hong Kong Parsi life that virtually all informantsexpressed was the harmonious unity within the community. Thedanger of emphasizing the shifting balance between businessmenand professionals, noted above, is that it may create the image thatthese social differences reflect different ‘camps’ in the community.There is little evidence of this. The Anjuman is run by trusteeswho are members of the old business families, but even in privatethe younger or more recent arrivals among the professionalsthought that this was advantageous, since the older businesspeople had the contacts, and the know-how, to run the Anjuman’saffairs. The professionals deployed in Hong Kong by their firmsare, in comparison to the old-established business families, rela-tively transient, even though their stay may extend for ten or eventwenty years. But as noted above, few retire in Hong Kong. Thereis also concern that newcomers might seek to take over, as they areseen as having done in Singapore, and a fear of the rash expendi-ture of resources which would undermine the sound Anjumanfinances. These healthy balances, and excellent facilities, enjoyedby the Anjuman are seen as evidence that the affairs have beenwell conducted. There was a strong and unified determinationthat Hong Kong would not become divided, as so many otherParsi communities have been. There is a quiet pride, and sense ofduty, in their extensive charitable activities. Occasionally there isa sense that other Zoroastrian communities come too readily toseek financial assistance rather than help themselves. There is littleor no networking with other diaspora groups; only a few individuals are in contact with friends who have moved toSingapore, otherwise all the international links are with the community in India. They are also approached by others, notleast from Pakistan, to find career opportunities.

Immigration law is so tight that beforetaking someone from overseas, it has to be shown that there is noone locally who could do the job, and in business that can rarelybe shown.There is relatively little interaction with Chinese traditions. Thecare for elders might be compared to the Chinese customs, butrespect for elders, family and ancestors is a strong Zoroastriantradition, and one that has not been challenged in China as it hasbeen in the West. In Hong Kong it is normal to bring a Feng Shuiexpert into a new home, office or building, to advise on the distri-bution of space and disposition of furniture to ensure harmonywith the spirits. On my two visits in the 1980s, few Parsi business-men said they had undertaken such consultations, but in onecase an expert was consulted quietly over the plans for the newbuilding. I was told, with some pride, that he had changed little,only small details. For example, he advised them not to have asharp point at the corner of the building, because the sharp pointrepresents a dagger, whereas Parsis are gentle and charitable, so itshould be rounded off; and it was. But in the disposition of thefuneral ground, another case where one would naturally look forinfluence, there is none. The community is proud that it sorts outits own problems, though occasionally it asks for the privateopinion of the High Priest in Navsari, Dastur MeherjiRana. Inshort, the Hong Kong Anjuman is something of an oasis of afflu-ence, benevolence and harmony at a distance emotionally, not justgeographically, from other groups. Religion is seen to be an activepart of community life in the employment of a full-time priest(virtually unique in the modern diaspora) who prays regularlyfor the deceased at the cemetery, and in the celebration of thegahambarsand occasional other rites, such as a jashanin the homeat important moments. But it does not have a prominent part.The study of the religion is practically non-existent. There havebeen three lectures by outside academics, one by Prof. Oxtobyfrom Toronto, and two by myself. But we travelled there at ourown initiative for research, not at the invitation of the Anjuman.There has only been one book written on the religion from withinthe Anjuman.

TheKarachi setting is evidently different, for here Parsis now live in anIslamic state. Given the history of the persecution of Zoroastriansunder Muslim rule in their Iranian homeland, the obvious ques-tion to ask is whether their experiences have been any different ina state created in the name of Islam. But Parsi history in Karachipre-dates the Partition of India and it is essential for reasons thatwill become obvious to trace that earlier history. When the Parsismigrated to Karachi in the nineteenth century they were movingwithin the sphere of British rule, for it is only since the arrival ofthe British in the Province of Sind that there has been a recordedParsi presence in the region. This chapter must therefore startwith a brief overview of the history of the British arrival in Sind.The British in SindThe region known as Sind has a long history dating back to theIndus Valley civilization; the area was also important duringIranian movements eastwards, and in the history of Islamic expan-sion into India.1For the purposes of this chapter, however, the1I wish to express particular gratitude to Mr Cyrus Mehta for his help with this chapter.He has been most helpful in many ways since our first meeting in the early 1970s, but as anex-Karachi man he has been of particular assistance in this chapter, as has his brother,Virasp, who kindly read through the text and saved me from many errors.

Thisoverview does not attempt to provide a balanced picture of theregion, but only to highlight the features relevant to the later studyof the Parsis. For that reason, I have not paid attention to what wasfor Sind, and especially for Pakistan, the huge issue of Punjab, andmention only in passing the establishment of Bangladesh.There are references to British influence in Sind from 1635 to1662 and 1758 to 1775.2But it was the late eighteenth centurybefore the British took a serious interest in the region. Their fearwas that Napoleon, and later the Persians or the Russians, wouldfollow this route to the Indian Ocean and to India itself. Despitesome concerns in London at the extension of conquered territory,some local British officials insisted on a presence both in Sind andalso in Afghanistan. This led to a succession of very expensive anddisastrous campaigns, the Afghan Wars (1839–42, 1878–81). Inthis context the most relevant is the First Afghan War, when theBritish supported a Sikh claimant to the throne against the estab-lished Dost Mohammad. On the allegation of a Russian agent inKabul, the British marched to support their Sikh nominee in1839. He was unable to rule unsupported, so the British army ofinvasion became one of occupation. A large camp of suppliersgrew to meet the needs of this army. But the position of theBritish became untenable from 1841 and they had to negotiate fora retreat, which few soldiers and suppliers survived.The initial interest, therefore, was in the provision of a bufferregion shielding the Indian jewel in the British crown. There wasalso trade rivalry with the local Amirs and between them and theSikhs, and over the use of the Indus for trade. When the Britishfound that they could not rely on a strong alliance with either theAmirs or the Sikhs, in 1843 Sir Charles Napier marched onHyderabad, Khaipur and Mirpur. He did this against the adviceof senior aides and to the unease of the British Government,who feared that the extension of their rule would increase costsunacceptably. The Court of Directors of the East India Companywere even more concerned, but acquiesced in the face of govern-ment persuasion. Another motive reputed to Napier is that, afterthe Afghanistan débâcle, he wanted to make a public show ofBritish power in the region. On the annexation of Sind in 1843The Parsis of Karachi1902R. A.

He was initially based inHyderabad, but then moved his base to the cooler seashore ofKarachi. This brief outline glosses over numerous instancesof British bad faith on local negotiations, and substantial changesof policies. The relevant consequence in this context is Napier’sbuilding of Karachi harbour and the development of an irriga-tion system to transform the infertile lands of the Indus valley.The population also increased, from an estimated 14,000 in anarea of 5 square miles, to 56,879 in an area of 74 square miles.3Those who benefited from his good public works built a hall inhis memory, which remains a prominent landmark in Karachi tothis day. In 1847 Sind was merged into the administrative orbitof Bombay Presidency and the post of Governor of Sind wasabolished. There was subsequently a sense of Sind being on themargin of British concerns, although Sir Bartle Frere, 1851–9,proved to be a good commissioner for the region and developedboth the harbour and roads. The Second Afghan War ended intotal ignominy and defeat, like the first. However, a result of thetwo campaigns was that the supply lines and movements of troopswent through Sind, thereby bringing more British interest in, andresources to, the region.4In the nineteenth century the port of Karachi grew consider-ably, supplying and functioning as an outlet for a huge hinterland.So from 1881 to 1901 the population increased from 73,560to 116,663. The port was developed in the 1850s, much of thetrade being with Bombay (a quarter of the ships entering Karachiwere from Bombay and a quarter of the departing ships sailedfor Bombay) and various European houses were opened. Thecotton boom in South Asia at the time of the American Civil Warboosted trade through Karachi. There were various further devel-opments that significantly enhanced the port. The first was theopening of the Karachi–Kotri railway in 1861, for hithertoKarachi had been a port with little more than a desert hinterland.In 1862, the start of the Karachi–England telegraphic serviceThe Parsis of Karachi1913In addition to Huttenbach see Azimusshan Haider,History of Karachi, private publica-tion of a Karachi Ph.D. thesis, pp. 10–12 and the same author,A History of Karachi Port,Karachi, 1980.4There is a large body of literature on these campaigns.

The opening of the SuezCanal in 1869 brought Karachi nearer to Britain than Bombaywas, which had not been the case when ships had to sail aroundAfrica. The introduction of steamers increased the use of thisroute, as there was a coaling station at Aden. In 1887 the KarachiPort Trust was opened.5By the 1880s several of the big Bombaybanks had opened in Karachi and in the same decade morerailways were built (to Quetta and Punjab), thus opening up theinterior for trade. Trade grew to such an extent that the KarachiChamber of Commerce was opened in 1897. Irrigation schemesmeant that the major exports were agricultural produce, primarilywheat and then cotton. From the 1920s, Karachi was second onlyto Bombay as a cotton exporter. Sind was separated from theBombay Presidency and was made a separate province in 1936.From that year the Muslim League came into prominence.Karachi remained a cosmopolitan city, with its wealth and tradein the hands of Hindus. With their departure in 1947, the gap inthe city’s trade was filled not by local Muslims, but by Muslimswho migrated from India, especially the Ismailis from Bombayand Menons from Kathawar.The concerns of Sind in the first half of the twentieth centurywere not only with trade, but also with politics, as the MuslimLeague’s tensions with the INC grew and the calls for the establishment of a Muslim state became more vocal.6This history is, of course, a particularly sensitive one, with considerablydifferent perspectives. Karachi is significant in the battle for nationhood for various reasons. First, it was the birthplace of Jinnah, the father of the nation. It was also, by the mid-twentieth century, not only the sole port but also the main trading centre of the region. It was made the capital city of the newly emergent Pakistan for these reasons, and because it was atsome distance from the Indian border with its soldiers, althoughthe Muslim League and the Punjabis had objected.7So KarachiThe Parsis of Karachi1925Haider,History of Karachi, pp. 44–52.6On the tensions between Hindus and Muslims, and the internal Muslim divisions inthe lead-up to the period of Partition, in Sind see I.

Most of theestimated eight million Muslim refugees travelling to Pakistanwent to urban centres, especially to Karachi, which changed fromhaving a majority Hindu population to being predominantlyMuslim. In 1951 it is estimated that 57% of Karachi residentswere refugees.9Many of the refugees represented a new class ofresidents: they were professionals from various Indian cities, manyeducated and westernized, and able to staff government officesand develop industry.10The centre of government remained inKarachi until General Ayub Khan came to power and moved thecapital from the refugee-dominated Karachi to the garrison townof Rawalpindi.The history of Pakistan is not easily summarized.11In the firstyears after 1947 there was a period of democratic rule, withgovernments changing swiftly. On his death in 1948 Jinnah wassucceeded by Liaqat Ali Khan, who was murdered in 1951. Inthe period 1958–71 there were two military dictatorships, with abureaucracy composed both of the military and of civilians. Theyears 1972–7 saw the return of a democratically elected leader,Bhutto, but he in turn was overthrown by a military coup, thatof General Zia ul Haqq. Bhutto was imprisoned on a charge ofcomplicity in murder and was hanged in 1979. Zia ruled fromThe Parsis of Karachi193London, 1997.

Thereafter in the 1990s there was a period of demo-cratically elected leaders, but of short-lived governments andinsecure coalitions characterized by serious internal disputes, andagain at the end of the millennium the establishment of militaryrule once more under Musharraf. In short, in its first fifty years ofexistence, Pakistan has had twenty-seven years of military rule,three heads of state killed or executed, and four periods of martiallaw. It has also had four constitutions, in 1956, 1962, 1973 and1985, when Zia gave himself absolute power. During this periodthe population of Pakistan grew from 32 million to 113 million, agrowth experienced mainly in the urban areas, notably Karachi.12Within this turbulent history there are major issues of particularconcern for this chapter: the economic development of Pakistanand the related subject of the country’s international relations; thepolicies of Islamization and the associated questions of educationand the power of the clergy.The Pakistan economyWith an average increase in GNP of 4% per annum over the fiftyyears of independence, Pakistan has one of the higher growthrates among emerging national economies. Because of politicaltensions in the early years after Partition, Pakistan developedits manufacturing industry in order to avoid foreign, i.e. Indian,imports. This was owing in part to the role of the urbanizedrefugees who had little knowledge of agriculture. In the later1950s the growth resulted more from agriculture, partly becauseof the re-emerging power of the great landlords and also becauseof the move of the capital from Karachi to the new capital ofIslamabad, which was more representative of rural Pakistan.Overall in the 1960s the economy was buoyant. Under Bhutto inthe 1970s there was substantial nationalization of large-scaleindustries and banks, but an encouragement of private investmentin smaller concerns.13One motive was to invest in major industries;another was to curb the power of some of the leading families.Zia reversed most of Bhutto’s policies, and the rate of growthThe Parsis of Karachi19412Burki,Pakistan, p. 171.13Ibid., pp. 111–20, 122–3; O.

Whereas Bhutto had alienatedSindhi landlords, Punjabi farmers, the merchants and industrial-ists of Karachi, Zia supported them. Benazir Bhutto did not shareher father’s socialist orientation and encouraged private enterpriseand utilities, but the instability of the 1990s, the decline of interna-tional financial aid and the ever-increasing allegations of corruptionhave seriously reduced the country’s economic standing.Pakistan’s foreign relationsA major feature of the Pakistan economy has been its foreignrelations, namely the wars with India, the Russian invasion ofAfghanistan and consequent American interest in Pakistan, andrelations with the Middle Eastern oil countries.After the India–Pakistan battles of 1948–9 there was furtherconflict in 1965 over Kashmir, and then in 1971 when Bangladesh,with Indian military support, gained its independence. There havebeen various periods of heightened tension, not least in 1985, 1990and 1997–8 when the two countries undertook nuclear tests and in2002 when it seemed that these weapons would be used in disputesover Kashmir. The country also became the focus of unrest whenthe Taliban escaped from western military force in Afghanistanand merged with various militant Muslim groups in Pakistan. Inone sense the 1971 war may be seen to have benefited Pakistan,in that it was no longer responsible for a region (Bangladesh) withserious endemic poverty. Further, while the nation had straddledIndia, its policies remained India-focused. Once confined withinits own boundaries, its attention could be concentrated on otherthings. But whatever the advantages in theory, in practice the warwas a huge blow to morale and resulted in the fall of theGovernment. It also left a yet greater suspicion of India and ten-sions continued. These military concerns gave huge importanceto the armed forces and consumed the bulk of the nation’sfinances; Pakistan is second only to Israel in the proportion of itsGNP allocated for defence;14the development of a nuclear cap-ability in the 1990s was a drain on resources and triggered inter-national disapproval.Whereas after Partition India at first sought a non-aligned sta-tus, Pakistan sought political ties with America.

This transformed the Pakistan economy,for the Americans were willing to give substantial aid and militarypower for support in the battle against the Russians, as they wereagain in 2002 when seeking support for the war in Afghanistan. Post-1979, Pakistan was considered a frontline state and became the thirdlargest recipient of American aid. Similarly, several Middle EasternMuslim states funded and supported the Mujahidin and the threemillion refugees, especially as Zia’s policy of Islamization grew.16These two sources of aid were obviously a huge benefit toPakistan’s economy. Another major source of income was thelarge number of workers who went abroad in the late 1970s, tothe Gulf States in particular (some to western countries). Themoney they sent back to their families meant that the nation’seconomy did not suffer as much from the oil price rises as didthose of many other developing nations. It has been estimatedthat as much as 80% of the trade deficit was covered by theseremittances.17In the 1990s these sources weakened as Americanrelations improved with the Russians, who withdrew fromAfghanistan. The Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, and its aftermath, alsohad a serious impact on the Pakistan economy because of theconsequent oil price rise and because a number of Pakistanismoved from the Middle East back home, so their income waslost. Under Zia there had been something of a second industrialrevolution; agricultural growth created a need for machinery;high taxes resulted in the non-reporting of business, and theresulting ‘black money’ oiled the wheels of the drugs and arma-ments trade. But some of the profits of ‘black economy’ were alsoused to fund industrial growth. However, the volatile nature ofsubsequent politics has caused problems for continued economicgrowth. The rise and fall of the economy is therefore a conse-quence both of internal and international political developments.IslamizationThese international pressures have reinforced a fundamental issue,the identity of Pakistan. There are also internal issues.

There are deep ethnic divisionswithin the country, between the Sindhis, the Punjabis, the peoplesof the Northwest Frontier Provinces (mainly but not only Pathan)and Baluchistan. The Government and the upper echelons ofthe armed forces have generally reflected the ethnic origin of theleader of the day, for example under Zia the Punjabis were atthe forefront. There has been hostility to central government onthree grounds: (a) ethnic and linguistic diversity; (b) economicdisparity among the regions—even after the independence ofBengalis in Bangladesh; (c) resentment against an authoritative,centralized government.18The nation was created as an Islamicstate and this was in a real sense its raison d’être. But the early leadersdid little to promulgate an Islamic state. Jinnah’s links with Islamhave been seen as somewhat tenuous. He refused to base thePakistan constitution on Islamic principles, and assured Hindus,Sikhs and others that the creation of a Muslim state would notmean the establishment of religious rule.19The logic of the creation of Pakistan appeared to be under-mined also by Jinnah’s successors. In the early years of the coun-try’s history, its organization was determined not so much byIslamic ideals but by the inherited old colonial bureaucracy. Thereligious leaders, the ulama, were consistently distanced frompower, while Zia, for his part, sought to bring many of them understate control.20Western-style democracy was not favoured forvarious reasons. Prior to 1971 it would have meant that Pakistanwas dominated by the Bengalis of the east, and the rulers were allfrom western Pakistan. There was little sympathy for the Bengalis;Ayub Khan, for example, considered them not simply to be eth-nically different, but also heavily influenced by Hinduism. WhenBhutto came to power through the electoral system, he at firstsought to weaken the power of the military, but was later obligedto appease them. He was more successful in weakening the powerof the bureaucracy.It was Zia, more than anyone else, who sought to useIslamization as a means of state control. In his first speech aftercoming to power, he said: ‘I consider the introduction of anIslamic system as an essential pre-requisite for the country.’21The Parsis of Karachi19718Ibid., pp. 192–216.19Ibid., p. 3; Burki,Pakistan,p.40.20See Noman,Pakistan, pp. 9–12, but above all Malik,Colonialization, passim.21Noman,Pakistan, p. 118."},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"J. Malik has shown in detail how this was done by bringing thereligious teachers and their followers under state control throughthe Government’s administration ofzakatfunds, to fund thoseinstitutions which followed state policy.22Zia also imposed stricterIslamic laws and punishments and in countless ways raised theprofile of Islam. He came from a religious background, but afactor in his policy of Islamization was to unite the powers of thestate in the face of external and internal threats. His policiesalso brought him closer to, and he became a beneficiary of, suchoil-rich Islamic states as Saudi Arabia.23After his death he wassucceeded by the liberal, more western-orientated BenazirBhutto, but her hands were tied by old allies of Zia, notably thepowerful President Ghulam Ishaq Khan, and Benazir’s greatantagonist, also a Zia protégé, Nawaz Sharif, who was himself tobe overthrown by General Musharraf. Despite the reason for thecreation of the state, there has therefore been only an eleven-yearperiod (1977–88) when Islamic priorities have been highlyprofiled by the Government. From the 1990s, however, themany products of the religious schools developed by Zia, and theproliferation of ‘sects’ that emerged from them, have produced ageneration of determined young people, with easy access to arms,who have brought violence onto the streets, not least in themetropolis of Karachi. The ulamanever fully came under thecontrol of Zia, and their supporters sought in their way toenhance the Islamization of Pakistan as they have radicalized andmilitarized themselves, a process reinforced by the movementof the Taliban and al-Qaeda into Pakistan from Afghanistan.24Parsis in KarachiThe early arrivalsAny account of this topic is necessarily heavily dependent on onesource: Jehangir F.

He was activein most Parsi charitable concerns in the area, including being atrustee of the Anjuman Trust Fund. In 1932 he became a mem-ber of the Karachi Municipal Corporation, and deputy mayor in1938, the year of his death. Through these and other activities hewas able to collect numerous details about the early Parsi arrivalsin a way that no other writer could now emulate. The followingsection is, necessarily, based on his work, but it seeks to give somepattern to the mass of details he collected in his Calendar.There are indications of individual Parsis in Sind in the tenthand twelfth centuries, but essentially the modern community datesfrom the middle of the nineteenth century. The basis of KarachiParsi wealth was their role as military contractors and commis-sariat agents from the days of Sir Charles Napier. Punthakeybelieves that the first Parsi firm in the region was the JassawallaCompany, based in Hyderabad, 1820–5. Two members of thefirm accompanied the British forces in their invasion of Kabul in1839 and shops were opened in Sukkur, Jallabad and Kabul.26There is also reference to the family having shops in Karachi andFerozepure. Punthakey notes five more families arriving in the1830s: Readymoney, Panday, Marker, Bhedwar and Rajkotwalla.When Sir Alexander Burns left Bombay on a diplomatic mis-sion to Dost Mohammad Khan, he wanted to take some studentsfrom the Bombay Native Education Society, but the only one will-ing to go was a Parsi, Nauroji Fardoonji. He returned to Bombayin 1838, but there is no record of him having used the experienceto develop trade in the area. Until the annexation of Karachi, themain Parsi base in the region was at Hyderabad, but when theBritish moved to Karachi so too did the Parsis and the first majorhouse to be established there was that of Hormusji DadabhoyGhadialy in 1844. He had been a contractor to the British forcesin the First Afghan War and made a fortune from buying jewelsfrom the Amirs. He was the first of the Parsis to bring his familyto Karachi, and therefore the first to make clear his intentionto stay, an example soon followed by others.

He wasthere for two years from 1839, but, fortunately for him, when theBritish retreated he was kept prisoner in Kabul and so survived,unlike all but one of those who went on the retreat. He returnedto open up a business in Hyderabad. Often the records do notindicate what the businesses of the Parsis were, but a common onewas the liquor trade. One of the early figures in this trade wasDinshaw Pirozeshaw Minwalla (nephew of Ghadialy) who camein 1839,27followed shortly by Maneck Mehta in 1843. Thefollowing year Ruttonji Framji Canteenwalla moved his trade,supplying liquor to the forces, from Poona to Karachi. He broughthis three sons with him and opened a large shop, with another in Jacobabad, where General Jacob commanded the Indianregiments. As the regiments moved around, so Canteenwallamoved his business. Another 1839 arrival, Dosabhoy MeherwanWadia, developed trade with America, a visionary activity for thattime, which resulted in him being made honorary Americanconsul in Karachi. Just as the liquor trade was one commonfeature of the early Karachi Parsi community, so too was a Suratancestry. Many Parsis were forced to leave the city during thisperiod as a result of droughts followed by years of famine, fire andplague. Many went to Bombay, but a number travelled north toKarachi. One noted figure to combine both of these features wasHormusji Sohrabji Kothari, who arrived from Surat in 1846. Whenthe cholera epidemic was at its height, he distributed sherry andchampagne freely to the people! It was not only liquor that Parsissupplied to the British; many acted as general suppliers, sometraded in cloth, or in beds and bedding; others worked as dubashes(stevedores). In the early years there were few ‘professionals’. Oneexception was Kaikhusroo Fardoonji, who passed his civil engineer’sexamination in 1847 and moved immediately to Karachi as asurveyor of public works. In 1857, Dr Burjorji Rustomji moved toKarachi after gaining his medical degree from the Grant MedicalCollege in Bombay, and worked at the government dispensary.

A major development was the openingof the port in 1853, when a passage was opened for ships of up to800 tons, which expanded the Bombay–Karachi trade. On hisretirement in 1857 from the government dockyard in Bombay,Ardeshir Wadia started running the Indus steam flotilla to developtrade on the Indus. Byramjee Eduljee also arrived in the mid-1850s and moved into the liquor trade. Byramji PirojshahMinwalla, too, came at that time and later became an owner offishing vessels.28Anyone knowing much of the modern KarachiParsi community will recognize many of these early names,for the descendants of these early settlers continued to play animportant role throughout the twentieth century.The early Parsi settlers were not only important within the Parsicommunity; some of them also became prominent citizens ofKarachi. In 1859 Dinshaw Maneckji purchased a printing pressand newspaper, the Sind Kased, the first native press in the region. Thefirst Karachi Parsi to develop extensive European trade wasHormusji Jamshed Rustomji, who moved to Karachi in his youth.He started as an importer of wine but also dealt in insuranceand real estate, placing regular advertisements for desirableresidences and office accommodation to let.29With Europeanbacking, he started the Karachi Tramway Company in 1884.

Parsis continued to be important in thework of the Chamber; for example, the millionaire philanthropist,Sir Jehangir Kothari, represented the Chamber at the Chicago exhi-bition in 1893, while he was on a world tour. It was the Parsi judgeof the Small Causes Court who regularized the Chamber’s affairsin 1903.31Similarly, when the Freemasonary lodge, ‘Harmony’,was opened in 1868, nine of the founding members were Parsis.32The Parsis of Karachi20128Patel,Kurrachee, pp. 18–21.29See, e.g. the Sind Official Gazettefor 2 Oct. 1869, 6 and 13 Nov. 1869, 4 Dec. 1869.30N.

Punthakey, thencollector of taxes, turned to trade as a supplier to the forces, andEdulji Dinshaw built his fortune on this trade before diversifying inKarachi; above all, he moved into land and factories. Dinshaw wasalso prominent as a charitable benefactor, being, for example, thebiggest single donor to the Sind Arts College in 1883 and the maindonor to the Lady Dufferin Hospital in Karachi, 1896. In addition,he funded several dispensaries.33He was made a director of theLand and Shipping Company; a delegate of the Parsi MatrimonialCourt; a trustee of the Karachi Port Trust and a member of theMunicipal Corporation.34In 1899 he was made a Companionof the Indian Empire in recognition of his services to Karachi.35Edulji Dinshaw and his son, Nadirshaw, were respected citizens. Inrecognition of their services to the city, their statues were placedat the intersection of the city’s main roads. After Partition, underIslamic law, the statues were removed. Eventually they were takenfrom the municipality storehouse and were placed in the grounds ofthe Karachi Parsi Institute.There is one further group of Zoroastrian arrivals requiringcomment, namely, the refugees from Iran. After Maneckji LimjiHataria (1813–1890)36had petitioned the Shah for theZoroastrians in Iran, small numbers began to leave and settle inIndia, anticipating not only personal security but also supportfrom their co-religionists, as Hataria had aided them in Iran.Sadly, not all their hopes were realized. Many Parsis viewed theirIranian co-religionists as poor, uneducated and unsophisticated.Their language difficulties made it difficult for them to obtainprofitable employment, so many worked as servants in wealthy Parsihomes.

In 1881 there were 1,062Zoroastrians in Sind, of whom just over half (556) were marriedor widowed, i.e. they had come as families. By 1891 the commun-ity had increased by 50% to 1,534, and by 1911 it had reached2,411. The growth was partly due to migration, but also to thenumber of births. Punthakey shows that every year between 1895and 1911 births considerably exceeded deaths (e.g. in 1896 therewere 611 births, only 30 deaths).39This growth in size, and in par-ticular the growth of families, meant that there was an increasingnumber of institutions developed to provide for their needs.Early Parsi institutions in KarachiA significant community action indicating a perception of settle-ment has always been, as we have seen in the chapter on China,the establishment of a funeral ground. One was established inHyderabad a short (but unknown) length of time before 1846,when a wall was built around the cemetery.40The Karachi funeralground, or aramghah, was also established sometime between 1839and 1844. In 1848 the first traditional dokhmawas built inKarachi, by Hormusji Ghadialy. By 1873 it was evident that thecommunity was growing so much that a new and large dokhmawasneeded. The collection of funds started in 1873 and the dokhmawas consecrated in 1875.The Parsis of Karachi20337Patel,Kurrachee,p.43.38Punthakey,Calendar,p. 53.39Ibid, p. 149. See also E. H.

It not only indicates the wealth of the communityand its charitable concerns, but also demonstrates that, from anearly time, the Karachi Parsis saw themselves as being permanentsettlers in Sind, more so than the communities in China and otherdiaspora groups did. By tracing briefly the history of some ofthese institutions one may gain a picture of priorities and of com-munal self-perceptions. Rather than detail each one separately,this chapter will look at the different types of institutions.Religious institutionsReligious institutions were chronologically the earliest concern ofthe early Karachi Parsi settlers. 1839 witnessed the opening of thefirst burial ground and the arrival of a priest. In 1848 a dokhmawas opened and the first alatwas brought from Gujarat.43In 1849the first fire temple was opened, and a nasakhanabuilt for thecorpse-bearers, a property rebuilt in 1866. In 1869 a school wasturned into a temple, with a proper temple being opened in 1875.The first sacred bull, or varasya, was consecrated in 1875 anda year later the first nirangdinwas performed—when the bull’surine was consecrated. In 1881 a fund for the priests’ salary andpayment for corpse-bearers was established. In 1904 the secondtemple fire was upgraded to the status of a permanently burningfire (Atash Adaran). This was rapid provision of a substantial reli-gious infrastructure for what was still a relatively small community.The funeral grounds are consistent with priorities of Parsi com-munities around the world. The act of greater significance than isobvious to the outside world was the consecration of the varasya,for this indicates a determination of religious independence.44The community in Bombay did not have a varasyafor approxim-ately 150 years after its foundation. It was, of course, easier forthem to obtain the nirangand bull’s hair for the rituals fromGujarat than it was for Parsis from the more distant Sind, yetit demonstrates a determination to resource not only the loweror outer ceremonies, but also the higher or inner liturgies.45The Parsis of Karachi20543Punthakey,Calendar,p.19.44Ibid., p. 86.45Unfortunately such a bull is no longer kept in the Karachi fire temples."},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":"The accommodation for the corpse-bearers was also significant.It had been customary for wealthy Parsi families to have theirParsi servants carry the corpse to the funeral ground, but withthe increasing wealth of the community few had Parsi servants,as Parsis avoided such menial roles. So a regulated force of pall-bearers (khandhias) was formed and a central provision thereforebecame necessary.46The first Dar-i Mihr was consecrated in 1849 in the areaknown as Sadar Bazaar. There had been a dispute regarding whowould fund the temple. Ghadiali, who had opened the dokhma,wished to fund it, but after some disputes it was agreed thatHirjibhoy Jamshadji Behrana would do so. It is noteworthy thatwhenever religious buildings or funds were required in the nine-teenth century, the money was quickly forthcoming. Behrana’swidow, in compliance with his wishes, had the building renewed in1875, and an upper storey was added and the whole thoroughlyrenovated in 1918.47The second temple, a dadgah, was consec-rated in an old school building in 1869. Located in Ghadikhatadistrict, it was named in memory of Dosabhoy MeherwanjiWadia. The utensils came from China—an interesting indicationof the international networks functioning even then. Most fundswere raised locally, but nearly a third came from Bombay. Thefire was upgraded in 1904 to enable the performance of higherceremonies. Kavasji Katrak provided funds for the consecrationceremony and maintenance.48The first full-time priest appears tohave been appointed in 1848.49Fundamentally, therefore, thecomplete provision for the religious life of the Parsis of Karachiwas in place within sixty years of the arrival of the first settlers,in a community totalling approximately only 1,500 persons(although that number was also the largest Zoroastrian diasporacommunity of the time).Educational institutionsIn chronological terms educational institutions were the secondpriority of Karachi Parsis. The first school was opened in 1859 forteaching boys and girls Gujarati and Zoroastrian prayers.

From 1875 English wasintroduced into the school and the girls’ syllabus was extended toinclude sewing classes. The 1871 records show that the syllabusincluded arithmetic, reading, writing, history and geography.50Inthe 1870s the numbers of boys and girls attending were roughlyequal.51The 1878 report refers to the education of a deaf mutegirl, indicating a care for the disabled as well as the able-bodied.52The 1898 records show the addition of a kindergarten,53and in1904 a gymnasium was added.54In 1906 it moved to yet largerpremises and in 1918 the girls were provided with a separateschool, the Mama Parsi Girls Secondary School.55In 1889another Parsi, Ervad Rustomji Pestonj Rabadi, opened a cosmo-politan school, with a particular concern for the less well-off.56This, and the Catholic schools, provided fierce competition forattracting the best Parsi students. The moves for female educationwere not easily implemented. Some traditional sections of thecommunity opposed them and it proved difficult to obtain suit-able lady teachers.57A brief history such as this necessarily glossesover the struggles of many valiant workers. The Mama GirlsSchool once opened was quickly successful, with 171 pupils regis-tered in 1918, a number which grew slowly and steadily over thefollowing years.58But the perception of an appropriate syllabuswas not strictly academic—there were few matriculations; it was,rather, domestic skills that were emphasized. In 1922 the boys’school expanded physically and intellectually when it became a High School. Under its headmaster, Dr M. B. Pithawala,Zoroastrian religious education was strong.Karachi Parsis have also been active in developing highereducation in the region.

After retiring asDirector of Education, he served as an honorary secretary of boththe Parsi schools. He was a leading figure and a trustee of theKarachi Parsi Anjuman.60The educational developments were not confined only to schoolsand universities. Various charitably-minded Parsis established otherfunds: for the education of young Zoroastrians, both in Karachiand overseas, for books,61for libraries and reading rooms.62Social institutionsThe term ‘social’ in this context covers two main areas: housingand opportunities for Parsis to meet. The Karachi Parsisaddressed the issue of communal housing before the communityin Bombay did. The records are somewhat ambiguous, but itwould appear that the first accommodation for Zoroastriansin Karachi dates back to 1854, with another in 1889, the latterknown as Jehangir Baug, funded by Jehangir Rajkotwala, whosefamily had built the earlier structure.63These were basicallydharamsalas, rest homes for Parsis travelling to, or settling in,Karachi. Similarly, in 1909 flats were built in the grounds of theParsi Club to accommodate Parsis from the outstations coming forsocial occasions. The earliest charitable housing, designed to givepermanent accommodation, was a home for widows in 1903,funded by the family of H. J. Rustomji in his memory.64In 1906K. B. Katrak announced a fund for flats for poor Parsis. Aftera wide search for suitable land, it was eventually decided (1908) tobuild this on community grounds, previously called the PanchayetWadi, now known as Anjuman Baug. The flats were built in 1911and five more buildings were soon erected on that land. It was tomanage this property that the first formal board of Punchayettrustees was formed, with a constitution in 1919.65In 1918 EduljiDinshaw erected a building with ten flats.66These moves forThe Parsis of Karachi20859Punthakey,Calendar,p.95.60Virbaijeeite, pp. 67–71.61Punthakey,Calendar,p.94.62Ibid., p. 96.63Ibid., pp. 119–22.64Ibid., p. 118.65Ibid., pp. 60–1, 110.66Ibid., p. 118."},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":"charitable housing for the poor anticipated similar moves someyears later in Bombay.

It was first established in 1923 and was registeredas the Karachi Parsi Co-operative Housing Society Ltd., underthe Co-operative Society’s Act. It is the oldest housing society inKarachi. A block comprising twenty-four flats was built withdonations made by the Mehta and Dubash families as an exten-sion to the Parsi colony in 1930 and is known as NoshirwanMehta Naman; it is now managed by the Karachi Parsi Anjuman.The Anjuman also manages Jamshed Baug with eighty flats. TheCyrus Minwalla Colony is a project built after Partition, in mem-ory of a well-known hotelier. It was built under the Co-operativeSociety’s Act known as the Zoroastrian Co-operative HousingSociety Ltd. There have, therefore, been substantial programmesto provide housing for Parsis in Karachi.Living in colonies is obviously one way for Parsis to meet andinteract. But there have been other important social organizations.The first was the Zoroastrian Club opened in 1893, more com-monly known as the Karachi Parsi Institute or KPI, or the ParsiGymkhana. It was founded by two Parsis eager to encouragesporting activities among the youth of the community, in particu-lar Dr Kaikhusroo N. Spencer and Prof. Burjorji J. Padshah. Aswell as indoor games such as billiards and cards, outdoor sportssuch as cricket (a pavilion was opened in 1916 and a swimmingpool in 1904), tennis, football and hockey also became popular atthe KPI.67Another important development in the social history ofKarachi Parsis was the founding of the Young Men’s ZoroastrianAssociation (YMZA) in 1910.68The meeting which agreed tofound the YMZA was chaired by Dastur Dhalla (discussed below),then only 35 years of age. The original idea was that of DinshawN. Kabraji, aged 21. The editor of the Parsi Sansar, PherozeshahR.

Katrak and the then young, latervery influential, Jamshed Mehta. Edulji Dinshaw gave financialsupport. So the foundation of the YMZA was a combined effortby the young and by ‘the great and the good’. Consciously mod-elled on the success of the YMCA in the West, it was concernedto provide recreational opportunities, reading matter in order tocultivate a taste for literature, and help with health and physicalfitness. Clause 2 of the rules and regulations passed in October1910 stated:The objects of the association are: (a) The diffusion of ethical and religiousknowledge and the cultivation of elocutionary and argumentative powersby means of lectures, debates and readings on literary and scientificsubjects open either to the members of the association or to the generalpublic as the association from time to time determines. (b) The promotionof goodwill and friendliness by means of social gatherings etc.69The first report mentions a wish to erect a building for a libraryand reading room—which was opened in 1920. The secondreport (1911) mentions twenty-two daily newspapers, weeklies ormagazines that were contributed to the YMZA. The Associationcontributed eleven, including the obvious Parsi newspapers JameJamshed, The Parsi, Hindi Punch, Parsi Sansar(Kothari supplied RastGoftar). But non-Parsi papers were also included—The Times ofIndia, Physical CultureandTit Bits(Association-supplied),IllustratedLondon News, MadameandFry’s The Man’s Magazine(by Kothari).The papers suggest an attempt to create a Parsi gentleman’s club.70The lectures were mainly on secular subjects (‘Does Civilizationlead to Morality?’) but religious classes were also held, givenmostly by Dastur Dhalla. The most successful cultural occasionsappear to have been Shah Namereadings. The new Association wassupported in its early years by the KPI, notably by the provision offacilities, and since there was then no rivalry the YMZAattempted little in the way of sports. In the first five years of itshistory, membership of the YMZA increased over 50%, from97 to 164.71Parallel to the Young Men’s Association wasformed the Karachi Zarthoshti Banu Mandal for ladies in 1912.The Parsis of Karachi21069Anon.,Jamshed Nusserwanji: A memorial, Karachi, 1954, pp. 2–4.70Ibid., p. 7.71Ibid., p. 5."},{"pageNumber":230,"pageContent":"The object was slightly different: ‘to alleviate the sufferings of thepoor and to work in such directions as would make a Parsi Ladyan ornament of a Parsi home’.72It has undertaken much widerwork also. In its eighty-nine years, it has not only alleviated thesufferings of the poor, but through its large endowment fundshas served the community by way of medical aid, educationalgrants for local and higher studies abroad and child welfareprogrammes.Another branch of Parsi social concern in Karachi has beenmedicine. This began in 1882 with the first Parsi charitabledispensary, followed by a second in 1887 and a third in 1903, allfunded by Edulji Dinshaw. In 1908 Dr Kaikhusroo D. Contractor,as noted above, started a maternity home at his own expense in ahouse next to his own. With funding arranged by Jamshed Mehta,this grew over the years into the Parsi Maternity Home, a placeconcerned not only with medicine but also with religious needs,where the purity laws could be observed.73The main focus ofKarachi Parsi medical charity does not carry a Parsi name. TheLady Dufferin Hospital was opened in 1894 in honour of theVicerene, but the single largest donor was Edulji Dinshaw. A wardwas maintained in this hospital for Parsis, and Parsis continue tobe substantial benefactors (often anonymously) to this, Karachi’slargest hospital.74In 1936 the Parsee General Hospital was openedin Karachi and named after Bomanshaw Minocher-Homji. Thisconcern has been sustained at the end of the millennium. Onhis death in 1999, Mr Justice Dorab Patel, the only one of thethree judges to vote against the execution of Bhutto under GeneralZia, donated all his wealth for the construction of a kidney hospital.75Thus, within a hundred years the Parsis of Karachi grewsignificantly in numbers and in the material and social provisionfor their community needs. What is striking is how the communityfrom early times saw Karachi as its base, as its home. How thisattitude fared after the creation of the Muslim State of Pakistanwill be considered below.

Dhalla.Dastur M. N. Dhalla (1875–1956)Dhalla was born in Surat but moved at the age of 3 with his fatherand uncle, when they became priests in Karachi. They wereextremely poor, living in an especially deprived area of the city.Dhalla’s weakness at mathematics meant that he did not matric-ulate, so instead of going to university he edited religious period-icals, but the costs of publication drove him into debt. He readvoraciously in the library in his spare time. He was initiated as apriest at the age of 15, and was devoted to the Zoroastrian reli-gion, frequently delivering fiery Orthodox lectures and articles. Inhis private life, he sought to follow a strict observance of the puritylaws, but his wife did not always agree with them. His lectures andwritings brought him to the attention of the liberal reformer inBombay, K. R. Cama, who arranged for him to study in Bombayfor a BA in Avesta and Pahlavi, which he obtained in 1904. Therehe decided to adopt a low profile in the Orthodox–Liberaldebates, which were very lively. In Bombay he came to the atten-tion of the visiting distinguished Professor of Iranian Studies fromColumbia University, New York, A. V. W. Jackson. Dhalla pro-ceeded to study in New York, gaining an MA in 1906 and a Ph.D.in 1908—the first Zoroastrian to obtain such a western qualifica-tion in Zoroastrian studies. While at Columbia, Dhalla took theopportunity to study a whole range of subjects, notably Sociologyunder Giddings, and Comparative Religion, attending the lecturesof Spencer. Spencer was then elaborating his theories on the evo-lution of religion, tracing a growth from animism to polytheism tohenotheism to the peak of the evolutionary ladder, an ethicalmonotheism. Jackson’s own committed Protestant faith alsoundoubtedly had a powerful impact on the Karachi priest. In hisautobiography Dhalla gave his own account of the impact ofthese studies:By reading books on anthropology and sociology, I began to examinescientifically, questions relating to superstition, magic, customs, cere-monies, prayer, priesthood, society, marriage and other allied subjects.I studied their origins historically, and, for the very first time I began tosee vividly how they have progressed from the primitive stage to theirpresent condition.The Parsis of Karachi212"},{"pageNumber":232,"pageContent":"My three years and nine months of scientific and critical study atColumbia University of such subjects as theology, ethics, anthropology,sociology and philosophy eradicated religious misconceptions that hadgathered in my mind due to my blinded mental vision, traditional beliefsand up-bringing. As the clouds of superstition dispersed, the mist ofmental darkness was rent asunder. I was free of the religion of fear thatwas the belief of infant humanity and turned towards the pure religionof love, the religion as preached by the prophets and uncorrupted bytheir fanatical followers.Now that I had been enlightened by scientific study, and nowthat I had come to know and gain so much, I no longer adhered to oldideas. My thinking, my outlook, my ideals and my philosophy of lifechanged. The purpose and meaning of living changed—everythingchanged.I was now eager to become the thinker of new thoughts, the studentof new ideas and the propagator of new concepts. In 1905 I had set footon American soil as an orthodox. Now in 1909 I was leaving the shores of the New World as a reformist.76There are three dimensions to Dhalla’s life thereafter. First, hewas elected the Dastur of Karachi in 1909, and until his death leda life of simple and deep devotion. Some of his critics in Bombayand elsewhere have tended to overlook this dimension to hislife. But all who knew him personally speak of his pastoral andspiritual work with sincere admiration. Second, he organizedmany bodies and undertook numerous religious initiatives.Perhaps the most (in?)famous of these was a series of Zoroastrianconferences in Bombay, in 1910–19. He sought to balance thecontribution of Liberal and Orthodox, lay and priestly; indeed,one of the leading Orthodox Dasturs, Dastur Darab Sanjana of the Wadia Atash Bahram in Bombay, agreed to chair the firstconference. Most of the leading Bombay figures supported the ini-tiative, until a whispering campaign alleged radical reforming plotsto let non-Zoroastrians into the community and to stop dokhmafunerals. The conferences became the targets of fierce communaldebate and eventually, after nine annual conferences, Dhalla gaveup the endeavour.77Another religious initiative was a sustainedprogramme over many years of lectures and classes in Karachi.Perhaps the best illustration is the Hamkharasermons underThe Parsis of Karachi21376M. N. Dhalla,Dastur Dhalla: The Saga of a Soul: An Autobiography of Shams-ul-ulamaDastur Dr Maneckji Nusserwanji Dhalla, trans. Gool and B. S. H. J.

Here he introduced congregationalprayers, not common in Zoroastrian tradition. For his lectures awell-intentioned supporter donated a teak platform, with rails, forhim to deliver his sermons. There was an outcry, for Dhalla wasthought to be introducing the Christian pulpit, and rumoursspread that he was going to bring in an organ for hymn-singing.78Third, and most important in this context, is his writing. Heproduced many papers, but of particular significance here area series of books on Zoroastrian history and theology, one on hisview of past religious history, one on the future of religion, anda devotional book of prayers.79These are not only important fromthe perspective of past history, but are also of contemporaryrelevance, for the writings of this western-educated Karachi HighPriest are often quoted by American Zoroastrian communitiestoday. Many Zoroastrians find meaningful expositions in thewritings of this devout Zoroastrian who wrestled with westernthought decades before they did.Dhalla sought to contextualize Zoroastrians in the globalhistory of religions. He presented Zoroastrianism as the peak ofthe evolutionary ladder, for he argued that Ahura Mazda revealedthe world’s first ethical monotheism to the prophet Zoroaster. Theprophet’s followers, however, were not as spiritually developed ashe was, and they quickly relapsed into the ancient nature worshipand polytheism of former times so that Zoroastrianism becameencrusted with superstition and magical beliefs by the priesthood.Modern western scholarship, he believed, laid bare the originalprophetic message and established Zoroastrianism as a highethical monotheism.The two publications which show his interpretation best are hisHistory, an academic work developing his Theologywith newmaterial and seventeen new chapters, and his devotional work,Homage. History, p. xxxi, states: ‘Zoroastrianism...as preached inthe Gathas is the very embodiment of the simple and the abstract.It is the realization of the ideal. It is the form to which the cominggenerations have to conform. Deviation from it means a fall,The Parsis of Karachi21478Dhalla,Saga, pp. 309–14.79Following the order in which they are mentioned above the books are:ZoroastrianTheology, New York, 1914;History of Zoroastrianism, New York, 1938;Our Perfecting World,New York, 1930;Mankind Whither Bound?

The last of these is now available on the Internet—see Ch. 10 below."},{"pageNumber":234,"pageContent":"a degeneration of the religious life.’ Consistent with contempo-rary Protestant thought, and biblical scholarship, Dhalla viewedthe later medieval theology as a degeneration from the pureprophetic message. His devotional work makes no reference to thetraditional myths of creation and renovation. Perhaps the mostsignificant omission is any reference to the cosmic evil being,Ahriman. Hence the classical perspective on death as the work ofevil is no longer possible. He therefore speaks of death as Ahuracalling men back to himself, and explains the death of children asbeing due to the fact that they were so good that Ahura calledthem back to himself—both views on death common amongcontemporary liberal Protestants. Hell he interprets as a stateof mind. His own religious position is especially evident in theclosing chapters of his Historywhen he writes about modernhistory. Even on the contents page (p. xvii) he headlines a section‘Orthodoxy is obstinacy to forget anything old and learn anythingnew.’ His chapter on ‘The Reform Movement’ indicates where hethinks truth lies, and his attack on the Theosophists and occulttendencies equally highlights his rationalizing, westernizedapproach.What Dhalla gave to his people was an exposition of thereligion consistent with the latest western scholarship. Among theOrthodox of Bombay this was contentious. He was often invitedto lecture there and had his supporters in Bombay, but the lectureswere at times disrupted by Orthodox protests. Among his peoplein Karachi his personality ensured that his teachings were gener-ally respected, increasingly so as the years passed. In addition tohis writings, he was deeply influential on different generationsbecause of the teachings he gave in temples, in meetings, in schoolclassrooms and in small groups. He gave a priority to religiouseducation in Karachi that it did not have in Bombay. Some of theprominent religious teachers in Karachi at the end of the twenti-eth century had been students of Dhalla, as too have some of thereligious teachers in the diaspora. In recognition of his workColumbia University gave him an Honorary Litt.D. in 1929, andthe Government awarded him the title Shams ul ulamain 1935.80However popular and influential Dhalla was, it would be a mistake to think that the religious life of Karachi Parsis was The Parsis of Karachi21580Saga, pp. 442–51, 488–91 respectively."},{"pageNumber":235,"pageContent":"fundamentally determined by western-influenced theology.Passing references in the biography of Marker (to be discussedbelow) and interviews with older residents of the city make itclear that the daily devotional round,loban, the burning of a divo,kustiprayers, faith in the efficacy of favoured prayers, four-daywedding ceremonies, observance of the purity laws (includingrestrictions on a mother after childbirth) and temple devotions, allremained part of the typical Parsi life. And Dastur Dhalla waspart of that spiritual life, for although his western studies affectedhis writings, every person I have spoken to who knew him, refersto his love for the practice of the religion, indeed his saintlyqualities. However Protestant the Dastur may be seen to be in hiswritings, in his personal life the practices of the religion hebelieved sustained his soul, just as they did those of lay commu-nity members.81He was the last High Priest of the Parsis ofKarachi. After his death in 1956, the community perpetuated hismemory by establishing an institution in his name, the DasturDhalla Memorial Institute. It invites lecturers from abroad, andpublishes his books.

This gave Karachi the fourth largestParsi population in western India after Bombay (59,813), Surat(4,938) and Navsari (3,727). In 1941, approximately one-third ofParsis in Karachi had not been born there (1,178 out of 3,721),indicating that the population growth was due not simply toincreased family sizes, but also to migration.82After Partition thenumbers initially increased further—in 1951 there were 5,018;but they began to decline in 1961 (4,685) until 1995, when therewere 2,824 Parsis in Pakistan, 2,647 in Karachi.83There are twofactors behind these declining numbers. The first is the commonParsi demographic pattern of an ageing population, more never-marrieds and smaller families. Gustafson identified this trend inthe 1960s.84She noted that whereas the median age for Muslimsin Karachi was 22, for Parsis it was 37. Whereas the numberof initiations exceeded the number of deaths in the 1960s, thereverse was the case from the 1970s (Table 5.2).

The Banu Mandal, asindicated elsewhere in this chapter, is a ladies’ social organization. Although it is not a professional data-collection organization, the Banu Mandal, administering numerouscharities, especially of a medical and educational nature, has perhaps the best range ofnetworks in the community. Sixty individuals in Karachi, one each in Multan, Lahore,Islamabad, Quetta and Peshawar, collected data during the Eid holidays when the majorityof Parsis would be at home. Few surveys ever achieve 100% reliability, but the general pro-fessional nature of the people involved, and the respect in which the Mandal is universallyheld, means that these figures are likely to be as reliable as one could hope for—probablymore reliable than an official census.84E.

Gustafson estimated that about 10.2%, or48 persons were leaving the community every year. The KarachiBanu Mandal’s census ( p. 27) found that a total of 1,114 personshad emigrated, most since 1978. They also noted that 68 personswere then studying abroad. Most of those living abroad reside inthe USA (47.38%), with 68 in Britain, 70 in continental Europe,20 in Canada, 12 in India and only 8 in Australia at that time.Similarly, of those studying abroad most (42\u000261.76%) were inthe USA, 17 in the UK and only 3 in Australia. The patternappears to be that whereas in the 1960s and 1970s familiesmigrated, including some of the leading members of the commu-nity, in more recent times the older established professionals andbusinessmen are remaining where their contacts are, while theirchildren study and remain abroad, mostly in the USA, others inBritain. According to the Karachi Zarthoshti Banu MandalDirectory, in 1999 there were 2,379 Parsis in Karachi, 186 inother cities in Pakistan, giving a total of 2,565 Zoroastrians inPakistan. So, after an increase in the Karachi Parsi populationin the years prior to the creation of Pakistan, and in the first fewyears of the nation’s existence, numbers have now declined backto where they were in 1911. But now there is the significant dif-ference that the population is a much older one than it was then.86Approximately one-third (990 out of 2,824) are over the age of60.87More Parsis in Pakistan have a degree or higher qualificationthan completed their education at school level (35.93% comparedwith 33.35%), with 322 individuals still studying, and only oneilliterate Parsi was found in the whole country. Approximatelyone-third (202 out of 545) of those with higher qualificationswere females, even though they represent the majority of theParsi population. The women do not appear to be achieving asThe Parsis of Karachi21986Parsis often suggest that out-marriage is a further factor in the decline of numbers.Ervad Charna kept a list of the out-marriages he knew of—in such a small community thegeneral pattern, if not the absolute figures, is likely to be reliable. From 1947 to 1985 heknew of 106 boys marrying out (83 to Christians; 12 to Muslims, 2 to Hindus; and the restwere of unknown religious affiliation). He knew of 109 girls who had married out (38 toChristians; 58 to Muslims; 2 to Hindus; and the rest to those of of unknown affiliation).The number of girls marrying Muslims is significant, because the girls would be requiredto renounce their religion. Two hundred out-marriages over forty years is a loss to a community where conversion of the spouse is not possible, but the figures are not as largeas some rumours have suggested.87Zarathushtrian Census,p.2."},{"pageNumber":239,"pageContent":"highly in Pakistan as they are in Bombay, but many more Parsiwomen achieve far more in terms of education and careers thanthe wider female population in Pakistan has been able to achieve.Most Parsis (31.91%) are employed in the service industry, only11.08% in business. This service to business ratio is especially trueof women but is also found among men (260 are in business com-pared with 490 in the service industry). These figures indicate thatthe nature of the community has changed in the course of thetwentieth century. But the levels achieved by the Parsis remainsignificant, with 220 individuals being managers, 141 academics/teachers, 99 engineers, 83 bankers, 64 doctors, 11 judges/advocates.Households remain small in size, with only 8.35% larger than fourpersons. There are 1,052 single people, two-thirds of them (684)over the age of 20.Reference has already been made to the probability that theKarachi sample in my survey was almost certainly skewed and soit is necessary to make only cautious statements about the pictureit produced. The figures suggest that it was generally an older popu-lation with more single people than is common in the diaspora.More of the respondents were part of an extended family. Althoughgenerally well educated, relatively few had undertaken postgradu-ate study; those who had done so had generally studied in Pakistan—people who studied overseas tended to have stayed there. They wereopposed to intermarriage. In Pakistan that would probably meanmarriage to a Muslim which would require conversion to Islam.The level of religious practice (for example prayer) was high andmore Karachi respondents than from elsewhere in the diasporaexpressed a belief in life after death and stressed the importance ofprayers for the dead. They affirmed the good relations within thecommunity and few believed in 1985 that they were subject todiscrimination.The question now to be addressed is how the Parsi communityof Pakistan, particularly in Karachi, made the transition from theirflourishing condition at Independence to where they are today.Parsis under Islamic ruleSome notable figuresAs Independence approached, the Parsis were not as nervousas might have been expected, because of their conviction that theThe Parsis of Karachi220"},{"pageNumber":240,"pageContent":"wider society saw them not merely as unthreatening, but ratheras substantial contributors to the region. This is well reflectedin Bapsi Sidhwa’s semi-autobiographical novel,Ice Candy Man,published in 1988, in which, although the disintegration of friend-ships between Karachi youngsters as the violence grew afterPartition is related, no antagonism is shown towards the Parsisby any of the warring groups (the book is discussed in Chapter 10below). An indicator of this respect for Parsis in the widerpopulation is a book published by a non-Parsi in Karachi in 1944illustrating ‘the colourful personalities of Sind’. It included twelveParsis noted for their contributions to industry, local government,education and especially for their philanthropy. This ‘outsider’s’recognition of the contributions to Sind by these individualParsis was not an unrepresentative image of the community as awhole.88The role of two men in particular, in this crucial period,merits special note: one was a Parsi, one a non-Parsi. The Parsiwas Jamshed Nusserwanji Mehta (1886–1952). His father hadbeen a highly successful businessman, running a wine and spiritsbusiness and owning several factories, and so Mehta was a richman. But he gave away virtually all his fortune to the needy of allcommunities, while he himself lived like an ascetic. He devotedhis life to Karachi, entering the Municipality in 1918, a bodyhe described as ‘a temple for the service of the poor’.89In hissubstantial review of Karachi Municipality (1925) he concludedThe Parsis of Karachi22188M.

He wasinvolved in the Parsi community but gave most of his talks underthe umbrella of the Theosophical Society. He was elected presidentof the Municipality for thirteen consecutive years and then mayorwhen that office was created. He was known as the ‘maker ofmodern Karachi’. He was particularly associated with concernsfor the disabled, and the poor and with subsidized housingand free primary education; he led campaigns for the victims ofepidemics, floods, earthquakes and riots. He eventually resignedfrom the Council in 1937 because he considered that corruptionwas becoming rife. When Sind was separated from BombayPresidency in 1936, Mehta was elected to the Sind LegislativeAssembly, but resigned after three years, again because of what hesaw as corruption. Although he was loved by all Karachi’spopulation, he had in fact declined Jinnah’s offer to join hisparty.91He wore the attire of a congressman, but he was nota member of the All India Congress Party, He preferred towork as an independent member in the Karachi Municipality andin the Sind Assembly.

You have rightly observed that the patriotism of the Parsees issecond to none. Nobody is more conscious than I of the great patrioticzeal which you have displayed (pp. 11 f.)The Markers are a particularly prominent family in politics.The autobiography of Kekobad Ardeshir Marker, 1896–1984,has been published in two volumes.99It is a remarkable story of aman whose early travels were in a bullock cart, and whose last wasin a jumbo jet. The Marker family was based in Quetta wherethey ran an ice factory (founded 1931) and a pharmaceutical com-pany (1941). Kekobad’s father started the family fortune as a sup-plier to the British and with the money earned the family alsoendowed many charities, not least the Marker school in Yazd,Iran. The British trusted both father and son and each worked inhis time as First Class Magistrate and Senior Civil Judge.Kekobad’s son, Jamshid, has served as Pakistan’s ambassadorunder numerous governments in such important postings asRussia, France, Japan, the United States and at the United Nations.The Parsis of Karachi22499Petal from the Rose, see n. 93."},{"pageNumber":244,"pageContent":"He acted as spokesman for the non-aligned nations at the UN,and was the Secretary General’s special envoy in East Timorwhen the war there was ended. The text of the autobiography (ormemoir, since it was dictated from memory not written fromnotes) gives a personal insight into many of the events and peoplementioned in this book. The Markers were related by marriage tosuch leading families as the Minwallas and the Edulji Dinshaws.They were prominent in the links with Iran, both in the nine-teenth and twentieth centuries, and in the post-1979 events yetto be related. Kekobad Marker travelled widely, for business,pleasure and medical treatment, and so he met many beyond theconfines of Pakistan, including the Shah, Bhownaggree andSaklatvalla.100He was present at the Delhi Durbar in 1912, and atthe Independence celebrations, and was subsequently horrified atthe mass killings and assaults. It was Kekobad Marker who led the deputation to Jinnah seeking assurances about the com-munity’s future. At the national level he worked with energy andintegrity to develop Pakistan’s economy as director of the PakistanIndustrial Finance Corporation, and then as chairman of theIndustrial Development Bank of Pakistan for seven years (two wassupposed to be the maximum term, but the Government urgedhim to continue). As an outsider, I had anticipated that Parsiswould fear a military government in an Islamic country. Althoughthere have been concerns, the periods of instability which have sooften been associated with democracy, not least under Bhutto,have generally caused even greater anxiety—a fact reflected inthe observations of Kekobad Marker.101One fear is that in fullydemocratic elections candidates would pander to the views of the(vociferous) majority and ignore the minorities. His memoir isremarkable for its insights into the life and times of the Parsis, andof Pakistan.The Edulji Dinshaws have been a widely respected family afterIndependence as they were before. Hoshang N. E. Dinshaw (died1967), in addition to funding the Nadir Dinshaw EngineeringCollege, played an important part in the economic developmentof the new nation. He held several major posts, including chair-man of the Public Investment Council, and of the ReorganisationCouncil; president of the central board of directors of theThe Parsis of Karachi225100Ibid., vol. i, pp. 177 f. and 212–16, respectively.101Ibid., vol. ii, pp. 185–191."},{"pageNumber":245,"pageContent":"National Bank from 1952 to 1964; vice-president of theFederation of the Chamber of Commerce in Karachi; a foundermember of the Old Buyers’ and Shippers’ Chamber ofCommerce and of the Pakistan Industrial Finance Corporation(later the Industrial Development Bank of Pakistan in whichMarker was involved); and a director of the Karachi ElectricalSupply Company. He was offered a knighthood, as JamshedMehta had been, and like him declined it on the grounds that hebelieved in ‘Duty for duty’s sake and not worldly rewards.’102Sotwo Parsis, Marker and Dinshaw, were at the forefront of the driveto develop the nation’s economy.Another prominent business family has been the Cowasjees,who owned a large portion of Pakistan’s fleet of commercial shipsfor the transporting of goods, essential to the Pakistan economy.The fleet was nationalized, without recompense, by Bhutto, butthe family later received some compensation and are, again,prominent in Karachi business. Unfortunately much less has beenwritten about them than about other prominent families.As well as remarkable families, there have also been some note-worthy individual achievements among Karachi Parsis, which bygiving the community a good public image have contributed to itssecurity. One of the most remarkable individuals was Mr JusticeDorab F. Patel, 1927–97.103He came from a wealthy Quetta fam-ily, which at one time had rivalled the Markers. After studies inBombay, and at the London School of Economics, he was calledto the Bar and after two years’ practice in London returned toKarachi. He first worked in civil law and was then elevated tothe bench of the West Pakistan High Court; in 1976 he wasappointed to the Supreme Court. He was one of the three judgesin the trial that led to the hanging of Bhutto in 1977—and it washe who delivered the judgement that the hanging was wrong, eventhough he was opposed to the style of Bhutto’s government.When Zia promulgated the Provisional Constitutional Ordersubordinating judiciary to military courts and requiring judges totake an oath to uphold the constitution, Patel refused and therebyprobably lost the opportunity to become Chief Justice of theThe Parsis of Karachi226102From an obituary supplied to me by the family, but source unknown. An article intheParsi Sansar, 3 May 1978, indicates that the focus of the known charities of theDinshaws, is on medicine and housing for the poor, including, e.g. a total of 226 flats.103Obituary, H.

He was invited to be the ambassador inParis, but said that he could not represent a government withwhose policies he had such fundamental differences. Thereafter,he devoted his life to human rights and social welfare, becomingin 1984 a member of the Asian Human Rights Commission andthen in 1987 of the International Commission of Jurists. Inachieving such high office in a Muslim state, and in standing sofearlessly against a president known not to like opposition, Patelshowed remarkable courage as well as a powerful sense of justice.Another Parsi, Justice Rustom Sidhwa, served as a judge of theSupreme Court from 1989 until 1993, when the GeneralAssembly of the United Nations chose him to be one the elevenjudges of the UN International Criminal Tribunal for formerYugoslavian war criminals, sitting in The Hague.Other Parsis have held high office in the Pakistan army: two,F. Golwalla and Sarosh Irani, becoming a brigadier and a colonelrespectively and both were decorated in the 1965 Indo-Pakistanwar. At the time of writing Kaizad M. Soporivala holds the rankof major-general, the highest rank held by a member of theParsi community. Two Karachi Parsis have become internationalballerinas—Rashna Homji and Nichola Katrak. Others havetaken political roles. Hoshang Broacha and Dinshaw Anklesariarepresented the minorities in the Sind Assembly in 1976 and1998 respectively and Minoo Bhandhara stood in the NationalAssembly. Mr Jamshed Kharas served as ambassador in Romeand Mr Homi Homji represented the United Nations in Bangkokbefore retiring to Canada. This small community has, therefore,produced a remarkable number of significant individuals whohave served in high positions in Pakistan.Parsi institutions in PakistanSeveral of the bodies discussed above under the heading ‘EarlyParsi Institutions in Karachi’ have continued since Independence,and some new ones have been established.Religious institutionsThe temples have continued in use, but theproblem of staffing them has increased. The 1995 community cen-sus recorded seven priests in Pakistan; this is for three temples—thetwo in Karachi and the very pleasant modern structure housingThe Parsis of Karachi227"},{"pageNumber":247,"pageContent":"the hundred-year-old fire in Lahore.104The maintenance of apermanently burning fire requires a team of priests in order to feedthe fire at the five appointed times of the day and night. The prob-lems of maintenance in a small community are especially acute: inLahore there are now only eighty-six Zoroastrians. In the interreg-num between priests, lay Parsis undertook the care of the fire on arota basis. But even in Karachi, the number of priests is a problem.For the two fire temples there are only six full-time priests and twopart-time priests. This is partly because, as in Bombay, few of theable young men wish to enter the full-time priesthood; consequentlymost priests are elderly. Some of the younger men of priestlydescent who have entered business have migrated to the West. Thenumber of priests is declining rapidly. On my first research visit toPakistan (December 1985) there were nineteen mobeds, includingsix below the age of 35, although five of these worked part time; bycontrast, in the 1995 survey there were seven priests throughoutPakistan. The shortage of priests to maintain the community’sdevotional life is therefore an acute problem. The fact that none ofthe serving priests has a son entering the profession means that inthe next generation the problem will be even worse. One of theyounger mobeds, P. D. Magol, has started a Mobed Welfare Trustto care for the older members of the profession, not only in Pakistanbut also back in the holy centre of Udwada. It has been somewhatcontroversial, as the Athravan Trust in Bombay has been. ButMagol, too, has now left and settled in India.One consequence of the increasingly visible Islamizationof Pakistan has been a perceived increase in attendance at thetemples. Pakistan was the only country visited in the course of thisresearch where the elders of the community stated that the youngwere more religious than they themselves had been in their youth.Such a statement cannot be verified, but it is an unusual perception.The explanation given was that whereas in the West peer pressurediscouraged youngsters from going to religious functions, inPakistan non-Parsi peers (notably Muslim youth) were glad to beseen to be religious. It is also a natural reaction for a communitythat fears external religious tensions to unite and strengthen itsown ties, not least in a temple.The Parsis of Karachi228104SeeParsiana, May 1993, pp. 17 f. on the centenary of the Bai Avanbai ArdeshirCooper Agiary in Lahore."},{"pageNumber":248,"pageContent":"There is also a problem with the dokhmas. Because of theproximity of the flightpath to Karachi International Airport, thevultures had to be shot. Since 1963, therefore, bodies have beenexposed for the crows and heat of the summer to decompose.The trustees reported in 1988 that in fact the bodies were notdecomposing; that the pit at the centre was blocked and requiredcleaning. This process was abandoned because of the difficulty offinding people willing to undertake the task and so the communityhas begun to debate the purchase of land for a burial ground.105The Anjuman acquired a plot of land for use as a burial ground,but the idea was dropped because of the distance from the cityand the high cost of secure fencing. Subsequently they were ableto organize the cleaning of the dokhma, so both of the KarachiTowers of Silence are in use, but as in Mumbai the problem is theslow or only partial decomposition of the bodies without vultures.In Lahore and Quetta burial grounds are used.Social institutionsThe building of charitable housing hasincreased since Independence, partly to assist the poor, for exam-ple people whose funds were tied up in India, and who could nottherefore maintain a home. Such housing also facilitated closecommunal contact. There are five Anjuman properties (somewere mentioned above): Anjuman Baug, which includesRajkotwalla Baug (eighty-two flats); Garikhata Property withthree blocks of twenty-four flats; Jamshed Memorial Baug withsixty-four flats; Noshirwan Naman (twenty-four flats); andDoongerwadi Property, 52 acres which includes the Cyrus Colonyand co-operative building ventures. In addition to the twenty-twoTrust Funds in Karachi looking after communal properties, thereare the Dinshaw charities (approximately 150 flats); Kotharis(forty flats), Cowasjee Foundation (thirty-two) and Kandarwalas(twenty-four). One of the priorities of Dinshah Avari on becom-ing Anjuman president was to increase the housing stock further.In 1961 there were 950 Parsi family units for a population ofsome 4,000. By the late 1980s that figure had fallen to 902 prop-erties, with redevelopment. However, they were serving a popu-lation which had declined to substantially less than 3,000, soalthough there were only 5% fewer units, the 25% decline in theThe Parsis of Karachi229105A. S.

This was originally started in 1912 as a sewing circleby Sohrab Mehta, nephew of Jamshed Mehta, who left lakhs ofRupees to charity.107Its work from the 1980s onwards has beenessentially charitable, originally for women, but increasingly foranyone in the community; the census work cited above is but oneexample. The largest sum of money (approximately 50% of thetotal budget) is spent on education, including loans to students, foreducation in technology, the arts and sports. The second mainarea of expenditure (approximately 25% of the budget) is poorrelief, for social problems and help in the home. A third areaof activity is medical work, including payment of hospital anddispensary bills of the poor and lower middle classes, as well aspreventative work through education. The members are also con-cerned with the rehabilitation of the able-bodied, making peopleself-sufficient by teaching them arts and crafts and by helpingthem set up businesses. Child welfare is another of their concerns.Finally, the women of the society undertake various charitablelabours, supplying clean linen for the hospital, entertainment andeducation programmes. All work is voluntary so that the moneydonated goes to meeting the needs of those they seek to help, withminimal overheads. Apart from the Zoroastrian Census of Pakistanand booklets on educational charities to which Parsis may apply,there is little in print on the Banu Mandal, but its impact on thecommunity is undoubted.108Educational and religious institutionsThe Virbaijee Boys Schooland the Mama Girls School continue to thrive, but few Parsisattend them. Jinnah had asked the community to open theschool doors to non-Parsis, and at the time of writing I am toldthat there are approximately ten Muslim students for each Parsi.Within the wider population the schools have a high standing.The headteacher and some of the staff continued to be Parsisthrough the 1980s, but the community increasingly sent theirchildren to the Catholic school, which had a reputation forThe Parsis of Karachi230106Information kindly supplied by Mr Ghadiali during my visit in 1985.107Information on the Banu Mandal was kindly supplied by Mrs A.

Such financially independentschools were also able to resist the pressures for Urdu as a mediumof instruction and for Islamic ideas to determine the syllabus. TheBVS and Mama schools, although they do not have the power ofsuch strong overseas religious funding as the Catholics have,continue Zoroastrian classes and religious prayers on holy days,for Parsi children outside the main curriculum, unlike earlier pre-Zia days when Zoroastrianism had been part of the mainstreamcurriculum.109There have been other educational developments. There hadbeen a Montessori section in the BVS, and a building for it wasopened in 1961. This is probably the only all-Parsi Montessorischool in existence. When it first opened it had 120 pupils, but bythe end of the 1980s it had only sixty-one, because the number ofParsi children had diminished as parents migrated. It takes childrenfrom 2 to 6 years old. The morning begins with prayers firstin Avestan, then in English. The syllabus includes Zoroastrianreligious classes, to give the children a foundation in their faith. Theclasses emphasize the basic Zoroastrian ethic of good thoughts,words and deeds, and relate the stories of the heroes of the faith,above all of course, Zoroaster, but also some modern figures suchas Dadabhai Naoroji and Dastur Dhalla.Another religious education venture was the opening inAugust 1977 of a Friday school for young children. It grewfrom a small group for friends and family of the three founders(Mrs A. M. Dinshaw, Mrs G. S. Talati and Mr Virasp Mehta) intoquite a large school. The driving force behind the Friday schoolwas parents’ concern for the religious needs of their children ina strongly Islamic country. Song and artwork are as much part ofthe classes as stories of the heroes and the teaching of prayers.This informal school caters particularly for children at non-Parsischools. When Friday ceased to be a weekly holiday, the schoolfunctioned on Sundays and so is known now as ‘the SundaySchool for Little Zarthushtis’. Following the emigration of one ofthe key teachers, the school now works under the aegis of theKarachi Zarthosti Banu Mandal.The Parsis of Karachi231109Parsiana, Sept. 1991, p. 3.

In 1979 a cyclostyle ‘bulletin’ was brought outwhich was essentially the programme of the group.

The IRM also has prayer and meditationmeetings and quizzes and encourages the singing of religioussongs.

Its primary function is ‘thediffusion of social, ethical, religious and literary knowledgeamong members of the Parsi Community’ and ‘social, moral andreligious awakening of the Parsi community’.112It mountslectures and symposia on Zoroastrian topics, given largely bycommunity members and others from Karachi. In the early daysDr Ali Jafarey was a regular speaker, and occasionally speakerscame from elsewhere, for example, Dastur Dabu, Dastur Mirza,Khojeste Mistree, Ervad Aibara, and Dr Master-Moos fromBombay. Its functions are sometimes held in collaboration withother bodies, such as the Young Men’s Zoroastrian Association.Many of the lectures, especially in the early years, were onDhalla’s work. The anniversary of his death is always observed.The Institute also had some books printed, notably Dhalla’sHomage unto Ahura Mazda, and purchased several hundred copies ofbooks written by members on the religion, and then distributedthem free of charge. The initial membership of 148 grew to 180in the 1980s. But with the declining Karachi Parsi population, thelong-standing problem of organizing a lecture programme toattract a reasonable audience has become more difficult.The problem of the declining population has also affected oneof the older bodies, including the Young Men’s ZoroastrianAssociation ( YMZA). Annual Reports show the membershipdeclined from 185 in 1961 to 81 in 1982. The result has beenthat whereas in the mid-1960s there was an active programme,in 1982 and 1983 there were no lectures, although the annualelocution and painting programme continued.

In 1985 there was an attempt to form a ‘ZoroastrianAssociation of Pakistan’. One issue for debate was the relative roles of Karachi Parsis andthose in other cities. In a circular dated 25 Mar. 1985, Viraf Darogo argued against thenon-Karachi Parsis because their leaders had ‘lost all importance in view of ill-feeling andhatred among themselves. In their petty and personal conflict, they have lost sight of com-munity interest, and by indifference to compromise have demonstrated the lack of qualitiesfor leadership.’ For similar views on community divisions, see Parsiana, Sept. 1990, p. 23."},{"pageNumber":254,"pageContent":"who have their internal fights, even though they may presenta united face to the outside world. Another problem is that as thethreat of extinction grows, so the battles for survival become morepotent. Each side fears that what the other is doing can threatenthe end of the community, hence passions run high over suchissues as the reforms of Dhalla. Also in a community which is sosuccessful in economic and social terms, there is a plethora of‘chiefs’ and a shortage of workers, so many believe that theycan provide the leadership to save the community. One Parsireligious teacher explained the issue to me in theological terms.Zoroastrians, he said, are brought up to see a complete dividebetween the Truth and the Lie, righteousness and evil. There canbe no compromise. When people disagree, the other party is seenas belonging to the camp of falsehood.Karachi Parsi Religious and Secular LiteratureDastur Dhalla taught many Karachi Zoroastrians and a numberhave continued his teaching and writing activities. There arefour main authors of books on Zoroastrianism: Sohrab Katrak,T. R. Sethna, Godrej Sidhwa and F. K. Dadachanji, all of whomcame under the personal influence of Dhalla. The prominentwriter of secular literature is Bapsy Sidhwa, brought up inLahore, now living in Texas. Two of her first three novels are onParsis in Pakistan (see further Chapter 10 below).Katrak was a businessman, a mayor of Karachi, a prominentmember of various communal bodies, notably the YMZA, anda benefactor of many communal causes. His book is essentially a history of Zoroastrianism from prehistoric times to the contem-porary Parsi scene, with approximately half the book on the lattersubject.116The account of the Iranian Zoroastrians (ch. 11)portrays the community there as mainly of ‘the humbler class’ andstresses what Parsis have done for their Iranian co-religionists,but glosses over the considerable achievements of many twentieth-century Iranian Zoroastrians. This is the sort of imbalancewhich many Iranian Zoroastrians in the diaspora have foundoffensive. The chapters on the Parsis stress the considerable ParsiThe Parsis of Karachi235116S. K. H.

There is a summary dismissal of Parsi Theosophists (ch. 23)and otherwise little on doctrine. In the circumstances, Katrak’schapter on Parsis post-Partition is interesting (ch. 24). He empha-sizes the problems Partition has caused: making it difficult forParsis from the two countries to marry; the inaccessibility ofKarachi Parsi funds tied up in Indian banks; and the problemsfor Pakistan Parsis wanting to visit their holy sites in India. He ispositive about the position of the Parsis in Pakistan: ‘The Parseesas a loyal and faithful race are happy and contented with the newregime.’ He stresses the regime’s opposition to corruption and theprotection of minorities. Of President Ayub Khan he wrote: ‘he isan idol of the Parsees who have the greatest regard and respect forhim, and feel that since the partition of the country they havenever been more secure, more free and more happy.’117Katrakalso publicly pays respect to Islam, just as Ayub Kahn had paidtribute to Zoroaster:Prominent Parsi and Hindu citizens paid glowing tributes to HolyProphet Mohammed at a meeting arranged by the Ahmadiya MuslimAssoc. in Karachi yesterday. Sohrab Katrak spoke on the mission ofthe Holy Prophet, symbol of the emancipation of humanity; the Parsileader said the system of zakat introduced by Islam was a very significanteconomic factor in the life of Muslims.118Sethna’s life was devoted to providing translations of suchZoroastrian texts as the Yashts(1976) for the benefit of his com-munity. He also produced selections of writings of some of the ear-lier scholars, such as J. J. Modi (1980), and reviewed the argumentson the date of the Prophet (n.d.). Sethna was not a scholar in theconventional western sense, in that he had not undertaken formallinguistic studies. He worked by comparing existing translations,checking them against standard Avesta and Pahlavi dictionariesand then providing a translation that he believed reflected the spiritof the prayer and the religion. In so doing, he produced bookswhich gave spiritual sustenance to his community. As a person hewas quiet and rather self-effacing, a man whose evident religiouscommitment shone through his writings.The Parsis of Karachi236117Who are the Parsees?, p. 256.118The Times, 7 Oct. 1959, a reference I owe to Mrs A.

He affirmshis conviction that individuals and societies need religion toprogress and the first need of religion is faith: ‘The religion ofHoly Zarathushtra teaches faith in Transcendent Reality.’ He dis-misses the popular contention that Zoroastrianism is (merely) anethical code, urging that it is a way of life, laid down by ‘the mas-ter of every science’: ‘[Zarathushtra] was exceptionally endowedspiritually, intellectually and morally. He was far above the rest of his race in every attribute which contributes toward humanperfection.’ He quotes Dastur Peshotan Sanjana approvingly:‘Zoroaster was the greatest spiritual force produced by our world.He was a colossal religious genius. He was the greatest Law-Giver,the Greatest Teacher, the greatest of the prophets, the unique onewho revealed the Mind and the Will of Ahura Mazda.’ InZarathushtra, writes Sidhwa, ‘we have a model teacher...Heconquered all by the force of his reasoning and arguments, hispiety and his prayers and by the force of the truth of his divineteachings . . . He is the original emissary of God.’121It is interest-ing to note the emphases in these passages. There is none of theHindu influence evident in the writings of such Bombay Parsis asBode or Taraporevala.

That is not to say these ideascome from Islam; they can be found in earlier Zoroastrian texts.But the choice of themes, emphases, words and ideas suggest aconcern to present a teaching that would not provoke hostility inIslamic Pakistan.The writings of Dadachanji have slightly different emphasesfrom those of Sidhwa.122They are more secular, partly in that theyemphasize the ancient history of Iran and then politics, commerce,professions, the role of women, science and the arts of the Parsis.123The theme of his first book is to show that:through patience, perseverance, hard work, honesty, industry and thenoble virtues which they have inherited from their forefathers, the Parsisrose to the highest pinnacle of glory in every walk of life ...never beforein the history of mankind has so much been achieved by so few. It wouldperhaps be difficult to find another community or an ethnic group of suchmicroscopic dimensions that has shone so brilliantly in the world.124It is essential for such a minority living in a potentially hostilereligious environment that community members both know whattheir religion stands for, and have a knowledge of, and a pride in,their history. In this sense Sidhwa and Dadachanji are comple-mentary. Dadachanji’s later book is more difficult to characterize,for it consists of the texts of 108 speeches and newspaper articlesproduced by him. The first twenty-eight items are on religion, butnaturally, given their original function, address popular issues ina manner accessible to the general public. The next twenty areon ‘prominent Parsis’, both from India and Pakistan. As many ofthem are speeches made in honour of, or at death anniversariesof the individual they are not critical biographies, but laudatoryaccounts. The underlying theme of all entries is the presentationof as positive an image as possible of the Parsis to the outsideworld. For example, one is a speech outlining the Parsi contribu-tions to Pakistan, delivered to the Minorities Conference in 1973( pp. 320–3).Marker’s book125is the work of a grandmother, the wife ofthe late Kekobad Marker, dedicated to her grandchildren andThe Parsis of Karachi238122F.

Thedoctrinal emphasis differs little from that of Sidhwa andDadachanji, friends who helped the author. An interesting detailis the listing of Dastur Dhalla among the great Dasturs ofZoroastrian history, alongside Tansar from Sassanian times,some of the great Pahlavi writers and Meherji Rana, generallyconsidered the senior Parsi High Priest. This esteem reflects thewidespread attitude among Karachi Parsis to their own Dastur.The two books (and numerous lectures) of Homi MinocherHomji are different again.126Since Homji’s second book was writ-ten after he moved to Toronto, it belongs to a later chapter. Homjiwas a high-ranking United Nations official and his first bookreflects the approach of an experienced administrator. After abrief review of the religion and its history he focuses on statistics,and on strategies for modernizing the community ranging fromeconomics to housing, legal, political and cultural matters. It iswritten to encourage Parsi reform. He writes: ‘Time moves on butParsis do not; we do not realize when it is time for change andwhen we do it is usually too late...Our anomaly is that eco-nomically we are a free enterprise, capitalistic, liberal society, butsocially we are rigid, conservative, non-changing religious group.’On post-Independence Parsis he writes:Having to some extent already degenerated through narrow parochialattitudes, prolonged genetic inbreeding, isolation from indigenous sistercommunities, and a weakening community structure resulting frominternecine disputes, the community failed to measure up to the requi-sites of the changed situation . . .

He speaks scathingly of being ‘cluttered up with ritualsand priest-craft’. His own description of his work is that it ‘isa post-Partition sociological analysis of the Parsi community ingeneral and of the community in Pakistan in particular. It dealswith issues of today and tomorrow—not of yester-years, andprojects a practical, not a religious approach.’127Evidently this isa very different point of view and range of concerns from thosealready discussed. Whereas much of Dadachanji’s material isaddressed to an external audience, Homji’s is targeted at his fellowKarachi Parsis.The last author to be noted is different again. Bapsi Sidhwa is aParsi novelist brought up in Pakistan but, following the success ofher two early novels, she migrated to the USA, where she hascontinued her literary work. Sidhwa was born in Karachi in 1936,but brought up in Lahore. Her first novel,The Crow Eaters, waspublished in Pakistan in 1978, in India in 1980 and then in theWest.128She wrote one other while in Pakistan,129but that is notabout Parsis and not so relevant to this chapter. A work completedin America reflects, in a semi-autobiographical way, on the placeof Parsis in Pakistan at the time of Partition, and the bloodyconflicts between Hindus, Sikhs and Muslims (Ice Candy Man). Herfirst novel tells the story of a lovable rascal, Freddie, taking hisyoung family to Lahore by bullock cart in the nineteenth centuryto profit from the trade opportunities with the British in theregion. Gradually his business grows, not always honestly, until hebecomes a major figure in the community and wider society, even-tually marrying his daughter to the son of one of the great Parsiknights of Bombay. The story is told with a mischievous sense ofhumour. Just as the best source of anti-Jewish jokes is the Jewishcommunity, so Parsis are merciless in their own self-presentation;Sidhwa’s book displays that humour as well as a love of thetribe. The depiction of Freddie’s tumultuous relations with hisThe Parsis of Karachi240127All the quotations are taken from his introduction, pp. x–xvi, ofWhither Parsis?128B.

As the Sikhs andHindus felt increasingly compelled to flee for their lives, the Parsisremained, confident that with their neutral and respected positionthey were safe staying on in the new Islamic state. The novel wassubsequently made into a film for general release and as a video.131ConclusionThe speed with which the Karachi community developed its reli-gious, educational and social infrastructure was remarkable, andindicative of the early resolve to settle there rather than simplyuse the city as a temporary base before returning ‘home’ to India.It was essentially a business community, and in the nineteenthcentury developed a history and pattern of life not wholly differ-ent from that of Bombay. The emergence of Muslim Pakistaninevitably affected the nature of the community and its religion inthe second half of the twentieth century. Many retain reasonablepostal links with family and friends in India, but travel betweenthe two, and staying in ‘the other’ country is not easy.

There are closer links between thetwo communities than has so far been indicated.132From the timeof Hataria in the nineteenth century there has been a groupof Iranian Zoroastrians residing in Karachi (see pp. 202 f. above).This trend was accentuated when conditions in Islamic Iranafter the fall of the Shah were at their worst. A number of Iranianrefugees fled eastwards and were cared for in Pakistan. Writer inher study gives an account of her meetings with some refugees.133Few spoke English (not a widespread language in Iran) but mostwere young male professionals. They had left because theyhad found their future as Zoroastrians (viewed as unclean (najesh)fire-worshippers), blocked in Muslim Iran. Their journey overthe mountains was hazardous and because of the conditions inAfghanistan would now be virtually impossible. They had left atgreat cost, because there is little chance that they will be allowedto return to Iran, and so will never see their families again. ThePakistan Parsis gave them accommodation and an English educa-tion and helped them seek an entry visa to the West by obtaininga United Nations blue card confirming their refugee status.Living within Muslim Pakistan has not imposed the severerestrictions faced by Zoroastrians in the Islamic Republic of Iran.Nevertheless, there is a strong sense of a significant chasmbetween the Parsis and wider Pakistan society. There is littleexternal socializing, hence the benefit of the many social as well aseducational and medical provisions within the community. A fewyounger Parsis, educated since Zia’s regime, have been obliged tostudy Urdu and so have some fluency in that language, but thosewho went to Parsi schools (which tends to mean the older genera-tion) and who live in Parsi colonies are more likely to speakGujarati. Perhaps the most common language is English.Similarly, a few Parsis wear shalwar-kameez, but not many, andeven fewer are interested in local music and literature. The intro-duction of Hadoot law under Zia has left many Parsis, includingThe Parsis of Karachi242132During my first visit, Mrs Bilimoria of the Banu Mandal estimated that 20% ofZoroastrians in Karachi in the mid-1980s were of Iranian origin, working in teashops andminor businesses. She informed me that there were no religious tensions between the twoZoroastrian groups.133R.

Intermarriage is naturallyfrowned on, for that inevitably means conversion to Islam. Theyare conscious and proud of their difference as Zoroastrians.However, the Zoroastrian tradition of benevolent giving to thepoor and oppressed remains strong. In December 2001 KarachiZoroastrians raised sufficient funds (including £1,000 from theWorld Zoroastrian Organization discussed in Chapter 10 below)to send three lorry-loads of food and clothes to an Afghan refugeecamp. The work was led by a past president of the Banu Mandal,Toxy Cowasjee.135But despite this conscious sense of distance between the Muslimand Parsi communities, it is inevitable that the religion is affected.Sidhwa’s careful emphasis on certain features of the religion thatwould not cause Muslim hostility is a case in point. The Muslimattitudes to purity mean that the community in Pakistan is moreconscious of this aspect of the religion than many are in the West.Questions of intermarriage and the purity laws have, for example,caused serious debate regarding who may and who may not staywith Parsis in a Lahore Parsi colony, specifically concerningoffspring who have married out.136Thus far Parsis, as Parsis, havenot been the targets of Muslim attack, although one, CaptainFeroze Kanga, did die as a result of a random shooting in The Parsis of Karachi243134See on this general issue of the distance between Parsis and the wider Pakistanpopulation, Writer,Contemporary Zoroastrians, pp. 171–84, on the laws and her interview withMr Justice Dorab Patel, pp. 176 f.135See S.

He had been married under the SpecialMarriages Act and was therefore judged not to have renounced his religion. The LahoreAnjuman minutes of the trustees’ meeting, dated 14 and 22 May 1980, debated whethera girl of Parsi parents who had married an American by a civil, not religious, marriage andwho had since left her husband, could stay with her mother in the Anjuman flat. Similarlythe minutes of 13 Nov. 1985 record a debate over whether a Parsi girl could stay withher mother though she had been married to a Muslim.

The early accounts oftravellers such as Burton in 1872,5and the diplomat Hardinge in1928,6naturally give the British imperial perspective. The ‘upperclass’ and typically ‘orientalist’ perspective is given by Hamilton.7Lyne has similarly written from a British imperialist viewpoint, asshown for example in his perceptions of the Africans and Arabs.8The modern historian whose work on the economy is of majorimportance, Sheriff, writes from an explicitly Marxist perspective.9The nature of the Parsi sources will be discussed below.Zanzibar in the nineteenth centuryZanzibar rose to prominence from 1832, when the Sultan ofOman, Seyyid Said, moved his capital from Muscat to Zanzibar.Hitherto his forebears had used their island possession as the outlet for mainland trade. From 1832 it became the centre of thesultanate. Seyyid Said traded with the Europeans, but fearingZoroastrians in East Africa246was one of Mr Dastur’s family, Pesi F. Dastur (1886–1919). He arrived in Uganda in 1907,became Head Clerk of the National Bank of India, and undertook considerable socialwork in Uganda. He started the Kampala General Agency to buy and export cotton, resist-ing European attempts to exclude Indians from the profitable cotton trade. He went on tobuild several ginneries. See S.

As the slave trade was gradually closed down, theclove trade replaced it; indeed, trade increased considerably, forit diversified also.11Following Seyyid Said’s death in 1856, therewas a dispute concerning the succession; one of the claimants,Barghash, was exiled to Bombay, where he settled in ParseeBazaar Street in the Fort area—where many Parsis lived.12As the region’s trade flourished through the nineteenth century,so various powers became interested in the area: the French,Belgians, Germans, Italians, Portuguese and British, as well as theAmericans. In 1876 King Leopold of Belgium established theInternational African Association to ban the slave trade and torepresent other European interests in East Africa. Prior to 1880the general European policy appears to have been to let EastAfrica develop by encouraging the spread of Christianity andcommerce, but to leave the administration to the native rulers,notably the Sultan of Zanzibar. However, the degree of controlexercised over his foreign, and then internal, policies grew rapidly.In 1884 at the Berlin Conference the process of demarcatingEuropean spheres of interest grew, and in 1885 a commission(which did not include the Sultan or any native representative)to draw up boundaries for the European spheres of influencedesignated what was to become Kenya as being under Britishauthority. The land which was to become Tanganyika was underGerman control; the coastal strip and the islands were left underthe rule of the Sultan, but ‘guided’ by the British, until in 1890they became a British Protectorate.13The ‘nations’ were createdsimply to serve European trading interests and bore no relation-ship to traditional affiliations.14Whereas previously the sultanateZoroastrians in East Africa24810R.

To obtain food,and extend his clove sales, Barghash developed trade with India,running four steamer ships on this route, and in 1872 he starteda monthly steamer service, Zanzibar–Aden, thus linking withthe London mail service. He also agreed to the formation of theEast Africa Association, not unlike the East India Company, toencourage more trade with Europe. This trade grew significantlyafter the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869. In Zanzibar itself heundertook a large building programme, with four new palaces andfor his people a vital project to supply fresh drinking water.15Despite his international trading ventures, he was dependent onthe British, and although he won some prestige with a formal visitto London in 1875, he was ruthlessly manipulated by them in theinterests of British trade in the region.16The successors of Barghash similarly had their powers graduallyeroded when Zanzibar became a Protectorate in 1895 (to ‘defend’it against growing German interests). Officials from the ForeignOffice in London came to control ever more of the internal law,the succession, the powers of the Sultans, and acted as regents foryoung rulers. The original British policy was not so much to ruledirectly, but rather to manipulate and control the region throughthe Sultan—though the distinction soon became questionable.17Zoroastrians in East Africa24915F.

While Consul General in Zanzibar, Hardingethought that he had negotiated the return of the coastal strip toZanzibar, but in 1894 the British proclaimed themselves rulers ofthe mainland.The notorious example of the violence the British were willingto use to enforce their authority came in 1896. When the SultanHamid bin Thuwaini died, an earlier—and in Arab eyes legitim-ate—claimant to the throne, Seyyid Khaled, entered the palacewith his troops. The acting British Agent, Basil Cave, and theConsul General, General Sir Lloyd Mathews, attempted to enterthe palace and install the British choice, but they were forced toleave.

The railway was known asthe ‘lunatic line’. It rose from the humid port of Mombasa to aheight of 8,000 feet at a summit covered in virgin forest. The deci-sion to build it was taken in 1895, and the first piece of line fromMombasa was laid in 1896. Indentured, or ‘coolie’, labour wasimported from India, mainly from the Punjab through Karachi,but professionals were recruited mostly from Bombay. By 1899 therailway had reached what was then a Maasai kraal, but was tobecome Nairobi, and in 1901 it arrived at Lake Victoria, the pro-ductive region of what was to become Uganda. The total labourforce recruited was some 32,000, with the first 350 arriving inMombasa in January 1896. Disease was rife and lions devouredtwenty-eight people. A total of 2,493 died in the construction ofthe railway and 7,000 had to be invalided home.20The recruit-ment of both labouring and professional workers from India waswell described by Sir Harry Johnston in 1899: ‘I wonder if inEngland the importance of one aspect of this railway constructionhas been realized? It means the driving of a wedge of India twomiles broad right across East Africa from Mombasa.’21The rail-way line moved the important centre of trade from Zanzibar tothe mainland; the port of Mombasa flourished, the new city ofNairobi developed, new trading opportunities blossomed and newcrops such as cotton and sisal were produced.By 1900 the number of Indians in East Africa is estimated at35,000, and many of these were the indentured labourers on therailway. A number remained after their period of labour, but itwas the traders and professionals who stayed on, rather thanthe labourers. It is thought there were around 25,000 and by 1948as many as 190,000.22These ‘middle-class’ professionals were integrated into a British system. Gundara refers to ‘the gradual one-dimensional British personality of the Indian communityin Zanzibar’, and to the ‘strongly entrenched British nationality’of the Indian community’s legal terms.23Yet they remained out-siders. The British Consulate officials vigorously asserted ‘Britishnationality’ throughout the nineteenth century on behalf of theZoroastrians in East Africa25120L. H.

They were given the duties, but not thebenefits, of the British in East Africa.East Africa and IndiaBritish domination resulted in the strengthening of links withIndia in general and Bombay in particular. Crofton, writing in1921, detailed the proportion of imports and exports of Zanzibarin the period 1893–1920.24He showed that the bulk of trade laywith British India, which represented approximately one-third ofall imports, twice as much as with Britain, for example; andaccounted for one-fifth of all exports, rivalled only by trade withTanganyika. Indian moneylenders financed much Zanzibaritrade, especially the clove trade, the basis of the Zanzibar eco-nomy. It has been estimated that in 1938 India took 90% ofZanzibar’s one-crop economy.25This made the landlord classdependent on Indian moneylenders.26The links were, however,more than economic. For example, one British concern had beento evolve a legal system in the island along western lines. From1897 the Indian Code of Criminal and Civil Procedure applied toZanzibar, as though it were a district of the Bombay Presidency.In criminal cases the assistant judge was deemed to be a magis-trate of the district of Bombay Presidency and the High Courtof Judicature of Bombay was deemed to be the High Court ofZanzibar—apart from cases involving the Sultan’s own Arab citi-zens, who could appeal to him.27In one sense East Africa was anoutpost of India. In the nineteenth century, consuls in Zanzibarwere seconded from the Indian Civil Service; many of the clerkswere Indians and so used Indian models of administration.Similarly, many of the lower managerial classes were Indian:draughtsmen, cashiers, customs officers and policemen. In 1908the Indian silver rupee was the acknowledged coin of theProtectorate, because of the close trading ties.28The first stampsissued in Zanzibar (10 November 1895) were contemporaryBritish Indian stamps, overprinted ‘Zanzibar’ and issued in termsof Indian currency in rupees and annas.

It is theIndian banker who supplies the large part of the capital29Because Indian communities generally kept within segregatedareas, parts of the large towns such as Mombasa and Zanzibarwere like Indian bazaars. Another feature of the Indian link withthe island was the provision of schools for Indian children, but notfor Arabs or Africans. Their education enabled the Indians toassume a disproportionate number of posts in government andcivil service.30Africans played little role in the Arab-dominatedadministration, controlled by Britain.East Africa was a potential outpost of India in a different sense.Some Indian leaders looked to the Indian annexation of EastAfrica. For example, A. M. Jivanjee, the richest and foremostIndian in East Africa who, among many other things, was themain supplier for the labour and resources for the building of theEast African Railway, said in 1906: ‘I would go so far as to advoc-ate the annexation of this African territory [Kenya] to the IndianEmpire, with Provincial Government under the Indian Viceroy. Letit be opened to us and in a very few years it will be a second India.’31Similarly, the Bombay Parsi Sir Dinshah M. Petit sent three remon-strances to the British Government in the early 1920s, describingKenya as ‘the natural outlet for India’s surplus population’.32Kenya’s White settlersIn some ways the biggest change introduced by the railway wasthe increasing number of White settlers coming from SouthAfrica and from Britain. From 1902 they were encouraged tosettle in order to farm the rich uplands. But with the new Whitesettlers came also social problems and divisions. By 1911 therewere 3,175 White settlers, and 9,650 by 1921. Settlement byZoroastrians in East Africa25329Mangat,History,p.61.30Hollingsworth,Zanzibar, p. 186.31Quoted by Bogot in B. A. Bogot and J. A.

Sir Donald Stewart in a letter to Lord Lyttleton in 1905commented, ‘Owing to the insanitary habits of Asiatics andAfricans, they are not fit persons to take up land as neighbours toEuropeans.’33In 1906 it was decreed that only Whites could settlein the desirable uplands.34There were also White objections tothe number of Indians, and so as early as 1902 they were callingfor restrictions on them:the further immigration of Asiatics into this country is entirely detri-mental to the European settler in particular and to the native inhabitantgenerally, it being considered that such importation creates unfair com-petition to Europeans and natives, the latter being in every way superiorin physique and morality, and more amenable to European supervision.Further the money earned by the native of the country remains herewhereas the Asiatic takes away all his earnings to his native country.35One of the many problems was that different communities stereo-typed the others. The Africans tended to depict Indians as cheats,mean and secretive; the Asians characterized the Africans as dull,unintelligent, lazy and dishonest. The Europeans presented them-selves as the guardians of the poor, innocent Africans, protectingthem from the machinations of the Asians, who were portrayed asusurers and exploiters.36Missionaries similarly presented them-selves as the protectors of the Blacks against the Indians and tothis end the Bishop of Uganda called for the geographical segre-gation of the races, and European women appealed to theGovernment for protection from the ‘Indian menace’.37Settlersfrom South Africa reinforced the British attitudes, and it was thatcountry’s legislation which influenced policy in East Africa. EastAfrican society has been described as having a tripartite structure,with Europeans in the top ruling stratum, Indians in the middlerank of managers and traders, with the Africans, the peasants, atthe bottom of the social pile. The European conquest of Africaexacted a heavy price for the Africans. Between 1902 and 1911,the African population was almost halved as people died from theZoroastrians in East Africa25433Quoted in Mangat,History, p. 100.34Hollingsworth,Asians of East Africa,p.56.35European Settlers in Nairobi petition, quoted in Mangat,History,p.98.36P. and Y.

No concessions were given on the land issue and only twonominated Asian representatives were on the Kenyan LegislativeCouncil—the rest were White—even though in Nairobi Indianspaid 25% of municipal rates and Europeans only 6.5%. In 1930,70% of government funds were drawn from the hut tax, i.e. fromAfricans, not Europeans. Voting rights were not matched withtaxes, or even education and property ownership, as the Indiansproposed. Yet the Whites were allocated 11,000 square miles, theIndians 32 square miles.40Put another way, in 1926 land wasapportioned in such a way that there were 400 Africans persquare mile, whereas the European farmers had 500 acres each.The White settlers may have presented themselves as the protec-tors of the Blacks—but that did not stop them from arguing thatincreased wages would make the Blacks lazy, and often payingwages in kind rather than cash to ensure dependency and forcedlabour (even from children, women and the elderly).41Various informants have told me that the British in Kenya weremore racially prejudiced against Asians than they were in India.Salvadori has collected memories of Asians in Kenya; frequentlythose memories are of deep racial prejudice, in work, in medicineand education, and in social relations. This was a key factor in theZoroastrians in East Africa25538See in particular W. R. Ochieng (ed.),A Modern History of Kenya 1895–1980, Nairobi,1989passimand esp. the chapter by J.

Important social changes were triggered by the arrivalof the White settlers. There was a major change in Indian stand-ing in East Africa. Whereas in the second half of the nineteenthcentury Indians had been seen as leading traders, resourcingmuch of Kenya’s economic activity, with the arrival of the Whitesettlers they felt themselves marginalized. Although they werestill prominent traders, they considered they were not given the recognition or the value they deserved, nor the political influencethey merited. They were discriminated against in health, educa-tion and justice, and through segregation they were denied anyelement of social equality. Their contribution to the growth of thecolony was ignored.44Perhaps the greatest consequence was thatafter the Second World War, the British had neither the humanand financial resources, nor the will, to rule a global empire,especially in the face of American opposition. With the model ofIndian Independence came the first hope of African independ-ence. Tinker mapped out the overseas Indian population at thetime of Indian Independence (1947). The largest settlements werein Ceylon and Burma (approximately 750,000 in each), comparedwith 184,355 in East Africa.

Three must suffice here: anAsian doctor was not allowed to treat Europeans in a European hospital, they had to go toa European doctor (p. 175); memories of white police beating and imprisoning Asianswithout cause (p. 159); the prejudice against a white woman married to a Goan (p. 174).It was experienced even by highly professional people, e.g. a Parsi who was responsible formuch of the major building work in Zanzibar and Mombasa, stories related below.43The standard work on the overall picture is V.

It is important for this modern period totreat Zanzibar and Kenya separately.The post-war period in ZanzibarThe First World War largely passed Zanzibar by.46As a result ofprotest, local interests began to be taken into account more as the1920s passed. In Zanzibar there was not the problem of white set-tlers. However, Zanzibar’s trade could not remain unaffected bythe collapse of the American share market in 1929. The clovemarket in particular, but others as well, virtually collapsed and the1930s were spent trying to recover the situation.As the African nations were given independence in the 1960sand the British departure became evident, so the struggles toinherit control grew. The Indian population had become evermore powerful in the civil administration, so that the New YorkTimesaccused the Indians of holding the islands off the EastAfrica coast in an iron grasp, and said that they were taking overBritish East Africa’s colonies.47Political parties grew to reflect theinterests of the various groups. The Zanzibar Nationalist Party(ZNP), although proclaiming a platform of Africa for the Africans,was mainly concerned to proclaim the Arab cause. The Afro-Shirazi Party (ASP) spoke for the Africans, the squatters and thepoor.48There were fears on all sides. The Africans feared thatMuslim rule would result in the reintroduction of slavery; theArabs feared being swamped by the African majority—that is,that the impoverished would supplant the landed classes. TheIndian population was reluctant to see the British depart so speed-ily, fearing the other two groups would shut them out. Theyformed the Indian National Association, but that quickly becamefragmented. In the 1957 elections the ASP were dominant. TheArab groups did not win a seat, so the election was seen to linkZoroastrians in East Africa25745H.

The other seats were filled by thenominees of the Sultan, who acted on the ‘advice’ of the BritishResident; by now the Sultan was a ruler like the British monarch,with little political or administrative responsibility.Calls for genuine independence grew, and in 1960 the newlyelected Ian Macleod, a liberal Conservative Colonial Secretary,established a commission to look into the prospects.49The recom-mendation was that the Sultan should continue to be abovepolitics; that there should be a salaried opposition, but that allmembers of the Legislative Council should be elected. Theirdeliberations were to be overseen by an independent Speaker.Racial issues dogged the 1961 election campaign. The ZNP, whileclaiming to be nationalist and to speak for the poor, was linked tothe Muslim groups, whereas the ASP again stressed the interestsof the Africans and emphasized ties with the mainland. The ASPwon the election by one seat, which itself was won by one vote onthe island of Pemba. Such a result could not stand; indeed itresulted in riots: sixty-four people were killed, sixty-three of themArabs. In 1962, A constitutional conference was called in London.The ZNP and ASP were implacably opposed. The ASP pro-claimed the Africanization of Zanzibar. It called for another elec-tion, which, through increasing the franchise and increasing thenumber of seats, it thought it would win. The British Governmenteventually closed the conference, saying that the parties hadshown they were not ready for independence. One of the fewdefinite steps taken was the acknowledgement by Zanzibari politi-cians that they did not wish to retain authority over the expensivecoastal strip, which Kenya wanted as a gateway to world trade.The closure of the conference resulted in protests, arrests andracial fears in Zanzibar, along with the fear of a Communisttakeover. In an election in 1963, the ZNP won by eighteen seats tothirteen, and independence came on 10 December 1963.

But itwas also able to benefit from the great demand for food and otheragricultural products grown in the region. In the years followingthe Second World War the influence of the White population inKenya began to decline with the fall of the Empire, but Whitesstill had the wealth gained through farming the fertile uplands.51Indians moved into some of the administrative vacancies, and thefirst twenty years after the war saw a significant increase in thenumber and influence of Indians in the region.

Asians domin-ated the socially respectable professions; so, for example, in1963, of 750 doctors in Kenya, 695 were Asian.58In the post-warera there was increasing urbanization, and the different lifestyle,reflected in cars and houses, became more evident, especially asAfricans were restricted to outlying areas and subject to a curfew.There was seen to be an outflow of capital, both to India andBritain, so Africans increasingly perceived that Indians weredraining away the nation’s wealth. As Africans became moreaware of the outside world, and of independence movements,so dissatisfaction with their own experience grew. The land-ownership rights, high salaries, taxation advantages, managerialresponsibilities—all were seen to lie with non-Africans. Thussqueezed, the Blacks began to proclaim their rights in their owncountry. A relatively early indicator of this dissatisfaction was thegrowth of African associations to represent their interests againstthe British and the Asians—sixty-three existed in Mombasa alonein 1946, twenty-eight of which were formed in that year.59Someeventually came to the conclusion that independence would notbe achieved simply through constitutional means: the Mau Mau,a group of freedom fighters, began their campaign in Kenya inthe 1950s. The British reaction was to declare a state of emer-gency in 1952. African political parties were banned in 1953—and then permitted again after 1955.

During the days of Empire the India Officeand the Viceroy had represented their interests, but after its ownIndependence India’s prime concern was her relationship withother independent nations. Since the East African Asians hadchosen to live in another country, often with a non-Indian pass-port, they were seen as beyond India’s responsibility. Nehru, forexample, was of the opinion that East African Asians should iden-tify with their newly emerging nations. Similarly, the Britishsought the favour of the emerging African states and had longsought to drive a wedge between Africans and Asians.

Hitherto they had not had to choose betweena British or an African passport, and so it has been said that theirhearts were in India, their wealth in Britain and their bodies inAfrica. Now they had to choose. Few in Kenya (as elsewhere)chose an Indian passport, because of their perception of povertyand limited opportunities there. Relatively few chose a passport ofan East African country for similar reasons. Residents were givenup to two years to register their African nationality. When thequeues of Asians at the British Embassy applying for passportswere seen to grow, anti-Asian feeling increased also.63As feelingsgrew, so it seemed the cry for Africanization became a cry for‘Blackenization’.64This was the pattern of events that led tothousands of Kenyan Asians departing for Britain in the mid-1960s, an exodus dramatically highlighted by the sudden, brutallyenforced, expulsion of all Asians in Uganda by General Idi Amin.But his act, however cruel, should not be seen as coming suddenly.65Zoroastrians in East Africa26261Tandon, ‘Political Survey’, pp. 75–82.62A.

Within theMuslim ‘community’ there were the Sunni (e.g. the Arabs) andIsmailis—whom the former do not recognize as Muslims. Similarly,it is often inappropriate to refer to the ‘Hindu community’. Mostpeople were more conscious of their Gujarati, Punjabi or Goanorigin. Even with those divisions, Patels tended to look after Patels,and so on. The word ‘community’ implies a far more monolithicbody than existed in practice. The only legitimation of such generalterms as Asian, Hindu, etc. is that outsiders, commonly Britishor African, did not distinguish between the various groupings—but that is to let outsiders determine description, rarely a desirablepractice. Perhaps the one group which had more coherence thanothers was the Sikhs, though even here regional differencesexisted.67There have been many debates concerning the impor-tance of caste among East African ‘Asians’. For some writers, thiswas a social structure that travelled with migration; for othersit was not. On balance it would seem that where groups weresmall there was little scope for caste divisions, but as numbersgrew after the Second World War, the various groupings becamelarge enough for some to observe certain caste distinctions.

Thisgeneral point is especially relevant to this chapter. The records ofthe Zoroastrian community in Zanzibar are uneven. The broadhistory from the 1880s to 1940s is on the whole not controversial,but some records have been lost, having been kept by the Parsi firmCowasji Dinshaw and Brothers of Aden—often known as ‘theAdenwallas’—who became deeply embroiled in community dis-putes from 1950. During that later period almost all the availabledocumentation reflects the views of one party, the newly electedZoroastrian Anjuman of Zanzibar, and in particular its energeticsecretary, Hoshang Kased. With such sources it is difficult toprovide a balanced account of the community, although I havetried to balance informants from the opposing groups. From theperspective of the Parsi historian the problem is compounded bythe fact that many external writers are either hostile to the Indiancommunity in general, for example the constitutional historianHollingsworth,70or refer to the Parsis and dismiss them as of littlesignificance. Ingrams, for example, describes the Parsis as ‘of nohistorical or ethnological importance’.71This chapter will argueZoroastrians in East Africa26468Morris,Indians in Uganda, pp. 16, 25, 27, 114, 116, 173; Hollinsgworth,The Asians ofEast Africa, London, 1960, p. 3; Twaddle,Expulsion of a Minority,p.11.69The subheading ‘Parsis in Zanzibar: the Emerald Isle’ deliberately invokes the title ofan unpublished typescript of Hoshang Kased, formerly of Zanzibar, now residing inMumbai, used extensively with his permission. By alluding to the title of his manuscript,I wish to indicate the extent of my indebtedness to him. As will emerge, Kased himself wasa central figure in the disputes, that form an important part of this section. I am deeplygrateful to him for his kind help, but clearly there is the problem of bias in my sources.70Hollingsworth,Zanzibar.71Ingrams,Zanzibar, p. 29.

There is one further important but little-known source, atravelogue written by Darukhanawala in 1905.72This is the storyof one of the early Zanzibari Parsi pioneers as he journeyed along therecently built railway and on into Uganda. Some of his asides provideuseful insights into the community and its ideas.It was noted above that before becoming Sultan, Barghash hadbeen exiled to Bombay where he lived near Parsis. He came intocontact with a number of them, for example K. N. Cama, and thefamous first Parsi judge in the British (Small Causes) Court,Maneckji Cursetji.73It was from Barghash’s accession to thethrone in Zanzibar in 1870 that Zanzibar became a part of Parsihistory, for among other Indians he brought with him were somenotable Parsis, including Darukhanawala and his brother. Thishistory will, therefore, start from 1870.The early arrivalsDarukhanawala’s travelogue (p. 173) identifies the first Parsi todo business in Zanzibar as an agent of Seth Kamani, in approxi-mately 1830. He states that the agent was so appalled at the slavetrade that he promptly left. Kamani’s business went bankrupt,but at the cost of everything he owned, he dutifully paid all his creditors, refusing charitable help. Unfortunately he died shortlyafterwards. Kased’s notes record the name of the first ZanzibariParsi as Maneckji A. Mistry, a member of the Wadia family andtrader from Surat, who arrived in approximately 1845.74For himZanzibar was an escape, for he had hit his European senior atwork, an offence for which he would have been executed had henot managed to escape in one of the Sultan’s boats. He built uphis business in Zanzibar, eventually bringing his wife and childrento the island. Darukhanawala also reports that:during his reign (1856–1870) Sultan Seyyid Majoid had called an expertParsi carpenter. He gave him a big salary and respected him very much.Zoroastrians in East Africa26572S. M. Darukhanawala, ‘Africa in Darkness’, in C. Salvadori and J. Aldrick (eds.),TwoIndian Travellers, Mombasa, 1997, pp. 99–238. Historians, especially of the Parsi commun-ity, are deeply indebted to the editors for making this source available.

From 1873 the Parsis started coming to Zanzibar and by1875 there were many, and today there are about 100 Parsis who havesettled in Zanzibar.75An American traveller, Osgood, in 1854 reports encounteringParsis in several ports in the Indian Ocean on his travels inZanzibar (pp. 35, 47), Aden (pp. 126, 160) and Mocha (p. 100). Heevidently held them in high regard:They are partial to the protection of the English Government...TheParsees adhere strictly to their religion and have never been known toadapt the manners of any other sects with whom their business inter-course has brought them. Their religion is politically a good one, andwherever found they are considered pattern citizens, by reason of a lib-eral and hospitable care for the poor—whom they do not permit to begof other sects—their quiet energy, industrious habits, courteous address,tolerant loyalty and good morals. Than a Parsee, can be found no morefaithful and enduring a friend, no more assiduous catcher—and atthe same time liberal squanderer—of money, no more skilful merchantor mechanic, no more tidy, accommodating and respectful servant...ahandsome man,...countenance open, animated, and bearing withintelligence. The Parsees never intermarry with other races.76Another early account of the Parsis in Zanzibar was that ofBurton, published in 1872 but actually written in 1857.A few Parsees from Bombay visited Zanzibar...two were carpenters anda third was a watchmaker, dishonest as his craft usually is. To the generalconsternation of Europeans, two Parsee agents lately landed on the Island,sent by some Bombay House whose name they concealed. These willprobably be followed by others, and if that most energetic of commercialraces once makes a good footing at Zanzibar, it will presently change thecondition of trade. They are viewed without prejudice by the Arabs andthe Wasawahili. The late Seyyid [Said] was so anxious to attract Parseeswho might free him from the arrogance, and the annoyance of ‘whitemerchants’, that he would willingly have allowed them to build a ‘Towerof Silence’, and to perform, uninterrupted, all the rites of their religion.77Zoroastrians in East Africa26675Darukhanawala,Africa, p. 174.76J.

Concludinghis account of the Indian communities in Zanzibar, he writes:Last but not least are the Parsis. They are of very recent advent toZanzibar. In 1861 the official archives show that there was only oneParsi in the Sultanate. Since that time they have slowly increased, andnow number about sixty-four. Thoroughly well educated on modernlines, broad minded, affable, enlightened, and highly civilised, they arerespected by all and much liked by the European communities.78The first Parsi known to have followed Sultan Barghash andsettled in Zanzibar (1875) was Bomanjee M. Darukhanawala,who worked as an engineer on one of the Sultan’s steamers andthen became Minister of Public Works, a post he occupied untilhis retirement in 1908.79At an unknown date within the next fiveyears he was joined by his brother Sohrabji M. Darukhanawala,who was the first Superintendent of Health, and the author of thetravelogue quoted above. Another early settler was MancherjeeP. Talati, a court registrar who came in 1875–8. Similarly,Bomanji D. Talati, who came in 1887–90, also became courtregistrar. A further indicator of the nature of the early Parsisettlement in Zanzibar is a report written by Rastom80K.

Because of his role in thecommunity he was particularly well informed. He reported:the majority [of Parsis] being in the Government Service...Theearliest members of the Parsi community came about 85 years ago inthe Sultan’s government as either Marine Engineering or Mechanics orCivil Servants and, at a later date, as employees of the National Bank ofIndia Ltd.

Sidhwa from Udwada, and hestarted the first ritual fire in a separate room on the ground floorof Darukhanawala’s own home.86The same year the trusteespurchased some land on which community buildings were to beerected, and Sultan Barghash gave them land for a cemetery. In1884 the various craftsmen and engineers, working under thesupervision of Bomanjee Darukhanawala, built the communityhall and a building for the fire. Although the community num-bered only twenty-six in 1884, the following year the Anjumanbuilt a community hall, priest’s quarters and kitchen. The dadgah(third grade of fire) was then moved to the main building in thecommunity’s wadi, or Shemba.87In 1886 they laid the founda-tions of a dokhmanear the cemetery. That was never completed,because the Consul General, General Lloyd Matthews (whoordered the notorious bombardment) and others obtained aninjunction from the court. They argued that the exposure ofcorpses in low-lying land (unlike in Bombay, where the dokhmais on a hill) would cause smells ‘and the probability of infection-carrying flies being attracted to the decomposition might provea source of danger to neighbouring residents’. It should be notedthat there were then neither vultures nor crows in Zanzibar. Thejudge said:I am of the opinion, and find as fact that there is imminent danger andthat the apprehended injury if it does come will be irreparable...[onthe advice of doctors consulted I] fail to see why the plaintiffs should beexposed to the danger of life and health...especially when the wholecountry round Zanzibar is open to the defendants.The injunction was granted, and the Parsis had to pay costs.88Thedokhmawas never built.In 1887, according to a contemporary, Major J.

In 1905 the prayer hall was extended.93At the instigation of the trustees, the firm Cowasji Dinshawsand Bros. (hereafter Cowasji Dinshaws) had established a branchof their firm in Zanzibar in 1884. Among their various activities,they ran steamers from Aden along the East African coast, so thata base in Zanzibar was a logical step. They were invited to becomesuppliers of provisions to the British in 1888 by H. E. Sir WilliamHewett, when he scrapped the naval store ship. The CowasjiDinshaws opened their Zanzibar office, run by members of thefamily.94Kased lists their other offices as being in Aden, Asmara(Eritrea),Djibouti (French Somaliland),Berbera(British Somaliland), Hoddeidah (Yemen), and later Mombasaand Dar es Salaam.95In 1909 they inaugurated a new steamerservice between Zanzibar, Pemba, Tanga, Mombasa, Lamu,Malindi and Kisimayu.96As well as supplying the British, theCowasji Dinshaws also were Agents for the Imperial GermanEast Africa Flotilla from 1902 to 1914.97From this extensiveinternational trade their wealth was considerable.

Itincludes some 125 graves. Twenty-seven of those graves indicatean Indian origin, mostly Bombay (seventeen), with four fromSurat, the rest from various parts of Gujarat.

It is, therefore, worth noting that the oldest woman’s grave isdated 1898.102Similarly, infant deaths indicate the raising of fam-ilies in the community. There are twenty children’s graves in thecemetery, the oldest dated 1888, for a child of the Talati family(grave 70). There are also six graves of people born in Zanzibar atthe turn of the century.103This small professional community,therefore, established itself quickly both in terms of religiousresources and of family settlement.

In 1956 there were 215 Parsis in Zanzibar.117Perhapsthe most important appointment was that of Keki. S. Madon asthe first Speaker of the Legislative Council in 1961. The occasionwas described in the Zanzibar Voice.118Two days earlier precisely at 10.15 a.m. His Excellency [the BritishResident, Sir George Mooring] with the Honourable the Chief Justicearrived in the Council Hall and were welcomed by the Chief Secretary.His Excellency then addressed the House and quoting Sir Erskine May’sbook on Parliamentary Practice, said that the Speaker is the representat-ive of the House itself in its powers, proceedings and dignity. His chiefcharacteristics are authority and impartiality. He is the custodian of theprestige and honour of the House and Members must acknowledge hisauthority at all times.His Excellency added that the task ahead before the Speaker as wellas members will not be easy particularly during debates when the heatrises and tempers are frayed, and at that time the Speaker, who is theone person above dispute, must be respected. The appointment of thefirst Speaker, he added, is symbolic of the constitutional advance andalso a turning point in the history of the Council.Community divisionsIronically, this period when Parsis were assuming a more promin-ent political, rather than simply high-level administrative, role,was also the time when the community was most divided. Inthe post-war period Cowasji Dinshaws changed their practice inmanaging their Zanzibar office, sending a manager rather thana member of the family. It is important to emphasize that thesole source for the following account is Kased and the Anjumanpapers, which as secretary he kept. These do include some courtand other independent sources, but they too have been selectedby Kased. Given this potential bias, the story will be related ingeneral terms, and used for later discussion of wider issues.On 14 February 1942, the first meeting was held in what was tobe a protracted and acrimonious debate. A number of ZanzibariZoroastrians in East Africa275117S. Pandit,Asians in East and Central Africa, Nairobi, 1963, p. 12.1184 Dec. 1960.

In order todo this they had to adopt a constitution and become a corporatebody with trustees. This caused tension with the firm’s Zanzibarmanager in particular. In a letter dated 5 September 1944,Dinshaw H. C. Dinshaw as head of the firm stated that if theCowasji Dinshaws were to continue to fund the building and bearassociated costs, then the head of their firm in Zanzibar must beconsidered head of the community, and as head of the commun-ity would represent their interests to the Government. If he wasnot so recognized, then the Cowasji Dinshaws would withdrawtheir financial support. The community was divided in itsresponse. Matters came to a head in 1953 with the formalestablishment of ‘the Parsi Zoroastrian Anjuman—Zanzibar’.One hundred and fifteen Zanzibari Parsis, said to represent 70%of the community, met on 16 February and approved the articlesof their constitution: a constitution eventually recognized by theGovernment on 31 December 1953.119Opposed to the Anjumanwas the Parsee Association, a group that supported the traditionalarrangement with the Cowasji Dinshaws.120One of the key problems for the Anjuman was funding for thetemple and priestly salaries and so they imposed a compulsorysubscription of 1% of each family’s income as a donation, incontrast to the voluntary subscriptions of previous years. TheAnjuman asserted that the non-subscribers would be given accessto the religious resources, the services of the priest and to therituals, but would not be allowed to vote at Anjuman meetings.121The matter eventually went to court, which found in favour of the Anjuman.122The financial problems were compounded bythe fact that the Cowasji Dinshaw’s manager had refused to fundZoroastrians in East Africa276119Bulletin8/54.120The new Anjuman began a regular Bulletinfollowing this meeting. Much of thefollowing account is derived from issues of that Bulletin, but the picture gained is inevitablyclose to that in Kased,Parsi Lustre, as Kased was the secretary who produced the Bulletin.The Bulletin Extraordinary5/53 gives the story of the Agiary Trust and the current debate.121Bulletin13/55.

Healso denied that the founder had established a trust to maintainthe agiary.123In addition, the manager had dramatically reducedthe funds for sandalwood, thereby threatening the continued lifeof the fire in the temple. Community donations quickly raised themoney to fund this.124It may be that one factor in the company’srefusal to maintain the building and continue the funding was itsown financial crisis, because in 1954 the firm in Zanzibar wentinto receivership, although it was eventually saved.125The newAnjuman was also religiously active in re-establishing the Avestaclasses for children, which had ceased. The number of rituals inthe fire temple also increased.In 1956, through mediation, there was some reconciliationbetween the Association and the Anjuman, although theAnjuman records continue to deprecate the published ‘untruthfuland malicious statements and propaganda in the press in EastAfrica and India’.126Part of this reconciliation was an agreementthat the head of the Dinshaw family be ex-officio head of thecommunity, but the Zanzibar-based vice-president representedthe community to government. The firm’s manager was given anex-officio seat on the managing committee and one of the leadersof the Parsee Association, Jivanjee F. Jasavala, was put on theboard of trustees and made treasurer, but his membership did notlast long.127A list of the members of the two groups shows thatthere were 170 members (including forty minors) in the Anjuman,compared with sixty-six (including twenty minors) in the ParseeAssociation—with eleven seeking to remain neutral. The list ofmembers shows that the divisions were within, and not simplybetween, families.128Unfortunately, another opposition group was promptly formed,the Parsee Fire Temple Party (PFTP). The membership was amixture of some of the old Association, and some disgruntledmembers of the Anjuman party. Their proclaimed concerns werereligious. They wanted to make the priest’s position permanentand argued that the whole community, not just the Anjuman, hadZoroastrians in East Africa277123Bulletin5/53; 14/55.124Bulletin6/53.125Bulletin8/54.126Bulletin15/55.127Bulletin20/59; 22/60; 24/61.128There were members of the Bulsara, Darukhanawala, Elavia, Engineer, Mehta andSidhwa families in each group.

The junior priestleft because his contract was at an end, but the senior priest,Ardeshir Dastoor, alleged ill-treatment by the Anjuman. One partof the allegation was poor pay, and Kased issued three sides offoolscap on 27 February 1960, seeking to justify the priestly paylevels. Something of the relations between lay Anjuman and offi-cials is perhaps reflected in a letter from Kased to Dinshaw H. C.Dinshaw, dated 14 October 1959. The Anjuman’s critics hadcomplained to Cowasji Dinshaws that the mobeds had not beenthanked for performing the (lengthy) muktadceremonies. In justi-fication Kased responded that no thanks had ever been expressedto the mobeds for performing muktadceremonies: ‘This is becauseit is one of the duties of the mobeds to lay the muktad table andto perform this and other ceremonies for which they have beenengaged and paid monthly.’ The contracts of the priests with theAnjuman consistently refer to them as ‘employees’. The argumentof the PFTP was that the priests should be treated with properrespect and consideration. At no point in the documentation isthere any suggestion that the priests themselves had any authority,even in religious terms. They were simply considered the paidemployees of the lay community, serving under tight contractsat the direction of Anjuman officials functioning in a menialcapacity.The matter came to a head with the end of the period of serviceof the assistant priest, Darabshaw G. Bhada who returned toBombay.130As noted above, the senior priest also left because ofwhat he considered the ill-treatment meted out by the Anjuman,131so in the interregnum before the arrival of a new priest fromBombay the members of the community had to tend the firethemselves.132The divisions were public and acrimonious, and once moreconcluded in court action. A member of the opposition party wasrequired by the court to publish an apology in the press for elevenZoroastrians in East Africa278129Bulletin22/60; 24/61.130The details are in Kased’s notes, but not in the typescript.131Bulletin22/60; Kased’s response is in three sides of foolscap dated 27 Feb. 1960.132Bulletin24/61."},{"pageNumber":298,"pageContent":"articles published in the Adal Insaf, a local weekly newspaper.

Parsis are not unique in the Asian diaspora inexperiencing such conflicts; indeed in other groups I have beenreliably informed murder has been committed, not somethingfound in recorded Zoroastrian history! Why there are such fiercedisputes is a question demanding more consideration in the studyof diaspora religions.Religion among Zanzibar’s ParsisAlthough there is no Zanzibar tradition of religious literature asthere was in Karachi, the Anjuman’s Bulletinclearly indicates ahigh level of religious practice. In addition to the two or threenaujotes, weddings and funerals recorded most years, many templerituals were also observed. The totals were announced at theannual general meeting, and indicate there were thirty to fortyjashansper annum, 350 to 600 Baj Rojgarceremonies, betweenthree and twenty machiand twelve to fifteen Fareshtas.135Ten daysofmuktadceremonies were regularly performed. How these tradi-tional rites were understood it is not easy to say. There are signs ofHindu influence. Crofton relates the story of an invitation fromMrs Dinshaw to attend the Vahi Pujaceremony, a rite adoptedfrom the Hindus to usher in the commercial year. He describeshow everyone sat in the office, with the books laid out on the floorZoroastrians in East Africa279133The names are in the records, but have been omitted here to respect the sensitivitiesof those involved.134The court case was reported in Bulletin24/61, the case was No. 81 of 1959, and thecase returned to court on 11 Nov. 1960 because the required apology had not yet been made.135Thanksgiving prayers and remembrance ceremonies, see Bulletin19/58; 20/59;25/61."},{"pageNumber":299,"pageContent":"in a recess in front of which were dishes of coconuts, cereals andcakes, signifying plenty. Wicks burned in tumblers of oil, with can-dles in modern holders and ‘a brazier on which was smoulderingsweet-smelling sandalwood’. The manager and five members ofthe firm sat cross-legged behind the booksand the priest took up his seat in front of the fire. The ceremony ofopening the new books then began, each Parsi taking one book andentering on the front page the names of the new accounts; the priest mean-while chanting prayers and keeping the fire plied with fragrant fuel...The ceremony was brought to a close by Mrs Dinshaw who with muchgrace went round to all present touching each forehead with a redcoloured pigment for good fortune.136On the other hand the religion could be expressed in Christianand Islamic terms, a point neatly illustrated in a copy of a letterfrom Kased, writing as secretary of the Anjuman, to the Sultan’sprivate secretary following the death ceremonies for the lateSultan:I have also the honour to inform you that soon after the above ceremony,the Community performed a ‘Jashan’ (Thanksgiving Mass) ceremonyon the Accession on the throne of Zanzibar, of our most beloved SultanSeyyid Jamshid Bin Abbdulla Bin Khalifa, offering humble prayers tothe Almighty Allah to grant His Highness, our beloved Sultan, long,healthy and happy life to rule over us all in peace prosperity and plentyfor many years to come, Amen.137The explanation of the jashanas a ‘mass’ occurs a number oftimes in Kased’s notes and typescript.138There are two indicationsof the Orthodoxy of the community. From 1960 the Orthodoxjournal,Parsee Avaz, was kept by the Anjuman, and when priestlyguidance was needed they brought Dastur Dr H. K. Mirza from Bombay, a visit which gave the community a high profile; hisaudience with the Sultan in 1962 was reported with a photographin the newspaper.139Within the community, he supported theAnjuman, in particular its efforts to maintain the sacred fire in theface of the criticisms from the Fire Temple Party.140Zoroastrians in East Africa280136R.

Parsi womenappear to have been fairly prominent in the community, althoughthere is no reference to a woman trustee. They are prominent inlists of charitable donors, two received the MBE, and two wereawarded the Queen’s Coronation medal. Miss Freny S. Talati wasthe first woman doctor on the island and she tended the Parsiswithout charge. The women also had a cricket team, and tookpart with men in Parsi dramas.Parsi loyalty to ZanzibarParsi relations with other communities were mixed. Their loyaltyto the British and Sultan’s government was commonly expressed,and explicitly appreciated. For example, at the jashanfor the ParsiNew Year, September 1952, prayers were offered ‘for the healthand long-life of our beloved Sultan Seyyid Sir Khalifa Bin Haruband Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II; for the peace and prosper-ity in the Protectorate; the British Empire; the Commonwealthand the whole world’.141In the only book (as far as I know)published by a Zanzibari Parsi on Zoroastrianism, the concludingparagraph reads: ‘Thus we have lived and wish to live and main-tain our identity of yore. May God help us and our future unborngenerations to be true to our tradition of tolerance, service andloyalty to KINGandCOUNTRYin which we make our home.’Earlier (p. 10) Sidhwa had emphasized ‘All prophets are accepted[by us] as Messengers of God.’142The themes of the role ofwomen, contributions to society and loyalty to the Governmentwere also identified in the piece submitted by Rustom Sidhwato Pandit’s volume (see p. 267 above). As the piece is shortbut intended to give a positive impression to the outside worldof what the Parsis themselves saw as important, the attributesit describes may be taken as being those which Zanzibar ParsisZoroastrians in East Africa281141Bulletin3/53.142The Hon’ble R. Sidhwa,Persia and the Present Day Parsees, Zanzibar, n.d."},{"pageNumber":301,"pageContent":"of the period saw as their distinguishing features. His piece, there,merits quoting, despite some repetition of details mentionedabove:Members of the Parsi Community, including ladies, have always takenleading part in the social work for all communities of Zanzibar and itis a matter of some pride that five male members and two ladies of thiscommunity were made MBEs. Among the professionals there are today[1956] three lawyers and a lady doctor (MB, BS) practising in Zanzibar.There is a Fire Temple of Worship built about seventy-five years agoand several members of this tiny community, at various times, haveliberally supported deserving general charities. The Sultans of Zanzibarhave on several occasions praised the loyalty and generosity of theParsi community and have honoured several of its members on differentoccasions.143Zanzibar’s Parsis and the BritishIn general, Parsis see themselves as more in sympathy with theBritish than with most members of the other Indian communities.Kased includes in his typescript a particularly interesting, andilluminating, episode in Dar es Salaam. In 1902 there were threeParsis in Dar es Salaam, including one Bomanjee N. Surti, who hadmoved there from Zanzibar in 1889. The German Governmenthad imposed dual jurisdiction in German East Africa.Bezirksgerichtwas law relating to the court of superior jurisdiction, and thisapplied to Europeans and certain Christians, e.g. the Goanese.Bezirksamtwas the law of the court of lower, or inferior, jurisdic-tion, applied to Africans and Indians. Subjects of the latter had noright to be tried in the higher court. Initially, the Parsis wereincluded with the Africans and Indians as subject to Bezirksamt.Surti was concerned that Parsis who came after him should not besubject to this lower law; the Consul General (Sir Basil Cave,whose speech to the Parsis was quoted above) appealed to theImperial German Governor on their behalf. After a succession ofletters over a year, the Governor informed the Parsis in 1903 thatthere would be no objection to this change of status on the part of the Parsis, but they must address themselves directly to theimperial authorities. That appeal exemplifies the common Parsiperception of their relationship to India and Britain, and is worthZoroastrians in East Africa282143Pandit,Asians in East and Central Africa,p.12."},{"pageNumber":302,"pageContent":"quoting at length.144The episode also relates directly to Zanzibar,for Surti feared that if it became apparent that there were onlythree Parsis in the German Territory the appeal would lackcredibility. On Cave’s advice, he therefore obtained the unanimoussupport of the Zanzibar Anjuman, which presented itself as themouthpiece of all Parsis in East Africa. Cowasji Dinshaws alsosupported the appeal—a firm, as we have seen, that worked assuppliers to the German as well as the British navy. Drafted withCave’s assistance the petition read:[PetitionDar-es-SalaamSeptember 1903]To Graf Adolf Baron Von GotzenGovernor for Imperial German East Africa, Dar es SalaamMay It Please Your Excellency,We the undersigned members of the Parsee community now residing atDar es Salaam on behalf of ourselves and members of our communityhereafter residing or trading at Dar es Salaam or in German East Africabeg most respectfully to approach you on a question which affects notonly ourselves but also those of our community we might think it advan-tageous to come, to settle and carry on business within German EastAfrica . . .Up to now we have been subject to Bezirksamt. We now humbly andrespectfully venture to urge that members of our, that is the Parsee com-munity, are sufficiently advanced to enjoy the rights and privileges ofthose tried by Bezirskgericht.Our community though Indian in the sense that we have settled inIndia for generations is not really Indian because India was not origin-ally our native land, our ancestors having to fly from Persia at the timeof the Mahomedan conquest, and also because in our customs, habits,manners and religion our community is different from any other inIndia.Your Excellency’s countrymen like Max Muller, Dr Buhler and manyother savants, all of them Germans, have studied deeply the history ofour community and have thrown considerable light on the subject bytheir research and these savants have been good enough to consider ussufficiently advanced. The main body of our sect after their flight fromPersia settled in India and the British Government helping us, our com-munity in India has prospered much and helped materially in the tradeZoroastrians in East Africa283144The sole source for a description of this episode is, as far as I have been able todiscover, Kased,Parsi Lustre, pp. 79–82."},{"pageNumber":303,"pageContent":"and prosperity of India. It is our hope that in the years to come they mayoccupy a like position in German East Africa and that a large numberof our community may be peacefully settled under German rule.Your Excellency, from these arguments and for these reasons, will seethat our community in India as admitted by the British Governmentoccupies socially and intellectually the foremost position among othercommunities.We have the privilege of having a monotheistic religion; the moral codeprescribed by our religion is on a par with the ethics of the Christianfaith; our customs and habits are in no way repugnant to the cleanlinessof body or soul and our laws are adaptable to European jurisprudence.145This petition, in the light of the explicit support of Sir BasilCave, convinced Count von Gotzen, and the legal status of theParsis was changed. The emphasis on the good relations with theBritish, the trading and economic benefits to the rulers, the differ-ence from other Indians, and the shared Zoroastrian–Christianideals are emphases that are a common part of Parsi discourse.Something of the Parsi perceptions of the British and Indiancommunities is reflected in Darukhanawala’s travelogue. He con-demned the racism that lay behind the exclusion of Indians fromthe fertile upland areas, and he himself had been prevented fromundertaking such a venture. He wrote: ‘On the whole, the Indiansare not liked, favoured or respected in the country.’ He stressedthe crucial role of the Indians not just in building, but in running,the railway. ‘In spite of all these sacrifices and hard work,Indians are segregated and not allowed to own land or to farm...Ignorant white officials harm the Government’s interest byfollowing this racialist policy.’146But he was also critical of what heconsidered to be the typical Indian in East Africa. He wrote:The wind of the white man’s revulsion for black people that blows overNatal also blows here. Indians are to be blamed for that to some extent.The first reason for the English revulsion for black people is because ofthe Indians who originally had menial jobs but have now become richbut whose manners and habits have not changed. First of all they arenot educated, and then they have no idea of cleanliness.The Indians see no reason to change. Wherever they go, whateverdirection on earth, the Indians are disliked by the Whites who neveraccept them. The Whites just cannot bear them. This is why the Whitesfind it painful to be around them and try to send them as far away asZoroastrians in East Africa284145Kased,Parsi Lustre, pp. 79–82.146Africa in Darkness, p. 163."},{"pageNumber":304,"pageContent":"possible. If instead of such people, there had been educated Indians inSouth Africa and the rest of Africa, the question of racial segregationwould not have arisen. The English came across ignorant, ill-kempt andrude Indians in South Africa and other places in Africa, and believedthat all Indians were like that. How were they to know there could be somuch difference between one person and another?Zanzibar’s Parsis and India(ns)Yet the Parsi ties with India were strong. In 1962–3 Zanzibar wassubject to severe flooding and according to their practice theParsis donated quite generously to the funds for helping theafflicted. But the same Bulletin(27/63) also reported a much largerdonation (shs 3,445 to shs 275) to the National Indian DefenceFund for supporting India against Chinese aggression. Myex-Zanzibari sources inform me that the Indian community withwhich they mixed most was the Goans. The social club had facil-ities for entertainment and sports including an indoor badmintoncourt and an outdoor tennis court, and members of both com-munities attended ballroom dances at the Parsi Club and theGoan Institute. There were also intercommunal cricket matches,and a ‘cosmopolitan’ cricket team. The Parsi perspective on them-selves, therefore, was that they were more like the British thanother groups in Africa, but they did not simply ape the Britishuncritically. There was a strong sense of a link with India, andIndian causes. But above all else, they were themselves, a distinctracial and cultural group. They typically see themselves as part ofsociety’s élite in any country.147One interesting episode in the Zanzibar Parsi community’shistory which highlights their community pride, and to a certainextent their westernization, is their quest to win the Zanzibarcricket cup outright. Cricket has featured in other Parsi centres—Bombay, Hong Kong, Britain—and it will reappear in Chapter 9on Australia. In India, generally, both in the past and the present,cricket is a game pursued passionately by all communities. It is nottherefore simply a demonstration of Parsi westernization. Playingfor a European team was of course something rare for Asiansanywhere. But in Zanzibar, in 1892, three Parsis played for theZoroastrians in East Africa285147An illustration of this may be the emphasis on F. S. Madon’s role as a leadingFreemason in his obituary."},{"pageNumber":305,"pageContent":"European team against the navy and visiting ships. In 1899 theGazette for Zanzibar and East Africa(6 September) refers to a Parsicricket team, and lists the members. In 1901 the manager-partnerof Cowasji Dinshaws, Kekobad, summoned a community meetingin order ‘to consider and find out ways and means of improvingthe present unsatisfactory condition in which the Parsee CricketClub, at present is, and to put it in a sound footing’. The movereceived community-wide support, and as the number of Parsisworking in Zanzibar increased, the team’s results improved. In1924 the Parsis won the Dr Albuquerque Cricket Shield—in theface of competition not only of Arab, Hindu, Bohora but also ofEuropean teams. They repeated this achievement the followingyear, so in 1927 there were intensive community efforts to win forthe third occasion in order that they might keep the shield inperpetuity. At the AGM a formal selection committee was estab-lished, chaired by Meherjee Dinshaw, head of the community,with new players coming and daily training practices introduced.To widespread communal delight, the Parsi team won for thethird year and kept the cup.148In Parsi thought, cricket is part ofthe gentility, the ‘fair play’ of western ideals.149A similar valuesystem is reflected in Parsi attitudes to Freemasonry, and it istherefore significant that a Parsi, Feroze S. Madon, was a leadingMason.Zanzibar’s Parsis relations with other ParsisZanzibari Parsis had occasional contact with Parsis elsewhere inEast Africa. Not only did the priest from Zanzibar travel to themainland and undertake ceremonies for the Zoroastrians there,150but Zoroastrians from outside Zanzibar contributed to the fundsfor the sandalwood and for the temple. The Bulletinrecordsdonations from places as far apart as the Seychelles, Durban,Kisangali, Lorenco Marques, as well as the nearer Mombasa,Nairobi and Pemba.151Bodies were sometimes brought from themainland to Zanzibar for burial.152There are also references tomarriages between Zoroastrians from Zanzibar and Dar esZoroastrians in East Africa286148Kased,Parsi Lustre, pp. 85–7.149Hinnells,Zoroastrians in Britain, pp. 85–7, quoting speeches on the departure, arrivaland return of the first Parsi cricket team to tour England.150Bulletin18/57.151Bulletin13/55; 18/57; 19/58; 24/61.152Bulletin19/58; 20/59."},{"pageNumber":306,"pageContent":"Salaam and Nairobi,153and at No Ruz greetings were exchangedbetween Anjumans.

People assumed that they would remain for life,for they loved the island and had their own religious facilities.Both parties in the arguments assert that the documents studiedprobably give an exaggerated view of the divisions amongZanzibar’s Parsis. Their memories are generally of a good life inZanzibar. I have talked to several Zanzibari Parsis who were onthe island on the day of the revolution. Even when the gunfiringwas heard, they did not assume that there was a revolution. As the‘rebels’ moved in, it was (mistakenly) rumoured that Russian shipslying offshore had moved into the harbour. People were told toremain in their homes; there was shooting and looting. But fewParsis were harmed. I was told of only one Parsi who, after beingpersonally summoned by the new President, was first slapped andthen thrown into prison, because as a magistrate he had foundagainst the new President in a court case. But the two Talatibrothers, lawyers who had appeared for the new President before,pleaded his case and promised that if he were released they wouldsee he left the island immediately, which he did. The newPresident in fact made a broadcast stating that the Parsis shouldnot be harmed, because of their contribution to Zanzibar. Thisprotection was also due to the influence of the Talati brothers,and to the fact that another Parsi, Sidhwa, had campaigned forthe Afro-Shirazi party. Parsis had been seen to work for Zanzibar,not simply for themselves. They were known to have worked forZoroastrians in East Africa287153Bulletin15/55; 16/56; 22/60.154Darukhanawala,Africa in Darkness, pp. 125, 142."},{"pageNumber":307,"pageContent":"both opposition parties. Despite this protection, the political situ-ation seemed so volatile that virtually all the Parsis decided toleave. They were allowed to take their possessions and were notimpeded, although of course they lost all their property andlandholdings. The Parsi story in Zanzibar came to a relativelyquick, and sad, end. Some of the elders who had property in Indiawent back to the old country, but most moved to Britain. The fewwho stayed managed to maintain the fire until the mid-1980s, butthe priest left, and the fire went out.There is, however, a concerted effort to preserve somethingof this once thriving centre. A couple of Parsis stayed on and pro-tected the ‘Parsee Shemba’ (compound) and graveyard. A naujoteand wedding were celebrated there in 1969 but thereafter onlythree families were left to look after the Shemba so that it was notencroached upon or confiscated: Thrity and Rusi Madon, Eireenand Asad Talati and Tehemton Bhumgara tended the groundsand had the sanctuary periodically cleaned and repainted whennecessary. In 2001 Rusi Dalal from London circulated as manyex-Zanzibari Parsis as possible and raised funds to maintain theproperty, even though the two families left there were moving out.The hope is also to bring out the afargan, the ‘fire altar’, because ofits sacred associations and perhaps even install it in the proposedtemple in London (discussed below). There is a strong desire notto allow the long and successful history of Zoroastrianism on theEmerald Isle to fade away. One family, the direct descendants ofDarukhanawala, the early pioneer, remain behind.Parsis in KenyaThis section discusses the Parsi communities in the region thatbecame Kenya, but the story pre-dates the formation of the coun-try. There are in fact two stories under this heading, those of thecommunities in Mombasa and in Nairobi. It is remarkable howlittle these two stories interact. There are reliable figures for thenumber of Parsis in Kenya in 1948: there were 184 Parsi malesand 150 females, giving a total of 334, representing 0.2% of thenation’s population.155Zoroastrians in East Africa288155Report on the Census of the Non-Native Population of Kenya Colony and Protectorate, on thenight of 25 Feb. 1948, p. 61. On p. 65 it is recorded that there had been only 201 Parsis inthe region in 1931."},{"pageNumber":308,"pageContent":"Parsis in MombasaIt is again important to highlight the question of sources. Incomparison with Zanzibar, there is a paucity of sources. In whatfollows I am grateful to, and dependent on, Dara E. Patel, a jointtrustee of the Anjuman who kindly collected oral traditions andsupplied me with eleven pages of detailed information on peopleand milestones in the history of the Mombasa Parsi Anjuman.Other sources are detailed in the notes as they are used. As inZanzibar, the story of this Anjuman includes accounts of intensedebates and court battles.156The early settlersWhen Darukhanawala visited Mombasa in 1905, he was met byhis cousin, with whom he stayed for twelve days. ‘We visited theruins of the ancient city, houses, forts, the Parsi Anjuman andother buildings.’ So there was a Parsi community on the mainlandfrom the turn of the century at least, but that early history cannotbe reconstructed. Mr Patel’s father moved from India in 1910. Hehad been born in Daman, near Surat, educated in Bombay andcalled to Mombasa by his elder brother, Jamshedji, who in turnhad been called by his maternal uncle Sohrabji M. Mistry, whohad arrived in 1880 and established himself as a leading con-tractor and merchant. This ‘lineage’ exemplifies much of Parsimigration to the East Coast of Africa—relatives calling relativesto come for trade. Normally they came as single males andreturned to India. It was the twentieth century before manyfamilies settled in Mombasa. Not all came as contractors: otherswere professionals. Jamshedji, for example, worked in the law-court, and he also called his brother Bamanji to work in the court.Mr Patel’s father, Edalji, similarly worked for various well-knownlaw firms in Mombasa. Another leading early Parsi arrival, alongwith the contractor Sorabji Mistry, was Jehangir Bhedwar, whobuilt several government and commercial buildings including theold lawcourt, customs house, treasury building, railway station, postoffice, the building of one of the leading supply firms, MackenionMackenzie, and the original building of the National Bankof India—the first bank in the area. Bhedwar and Mistry wereZoroastrians in East Africa289156There are a number of Patels in Parsi history in the region: my informant is denotedby the form ‘Mr Patel’."},{"pageNumber":309,"pageContent":"therefore important figures in the growth of Mombasa at the turnof the century. There is a tradition in Mombasa that Bhedwar hadeven built the old port: steamships started calling at Mombasa in1870. On the main gate of the old port there is a bust of a personwearing what appears to be the traditional Parsi black cap,thought to represent Bhedwar. There is no proof that Parsisplayed a role in the early Arab history of the old city and port ofMombasa, but they were involved from the time of the Britishinterest in the region.The individuals mentioned so far came directly from India, buta number also came from Zanzibar, mostly professionals and courtofficials, engineers, surveyors, accountants and contractors whowere responsible for the East African Railway. Several of the earlysettlers were officials of the National Bank of India, including twohead cashiers.157Others worked for Makenion Mackenzie and Co.(later Smith Mackenzie and Co.) as cashiers and managers,especially in wharfage. The other leading firm in which Parsis wereconcerned was African Wharfage Co. (later Kenya Landing andShipping Co.). Often, as in the very early days, Parsi managerscalled relatives and friends from Zanzibar, Aden and India. Asa result the community had a network of family relations. Theleading Mombasa Parsi families as this time were the Talatis andthe Patels. There are minimal records from this period. One thatdoes exist is a Trust Deed from 8 October 1897, whereby a Parsilady, Dhanbai P. Botliwalla, donated land for use by the commun-ity as a cemetery. The management of this property indicates thatthe Anjuman existed at least from 1897, though some believe thatit goes back to 1860. The Trust Deed identifies five Parsis astrustees—Rustomji N. Talati, merchant; Khurshedji Nusserwanji,surveyor; Byramji Rustomji, pleader; Pestonji J. Mehta, clerk; andPerozshaw B. Khras, cashier. To these names should be addedRustomji D. Talati, the husband of the donor. Mr Patel informs methat it is thought that there were at that time approximately twentyfamilies, perhaps sixty individual Parsis, in Mombasa.The cemetery, as in Zanzibar, gives some evidence of the pat-terns of settlement. Of the eighty graves, thirty-eight are for men,twenty-four for women and fifteen for children. Ten of the sixteenearly graves are those of children. This suggests perhaps moreZoroastrians in East Africa290157Dinshaw N. Batliwalla and Edalji H.

The lownumber of adult deaths until the 1950s158suggests that families,like single persons, retired back to India.One of the earlier external references to Mombasa Parsis is anunfortunate event involving a Parsi priest. The East Africa andUganda Mailfor 13 July 1901, welcomed the news of the arrival ofa Parsi priest:Our Zoroastrian friends have, thro: [sic] the initial efforts ofMr R. N. Talati, a well known merchant in town, brought out a priest of their own denomination. We believe he has covenanted for a term ofthree years, and besides private local support, will draw a stated smallannual salary. The priest has taken up his residence in the MakupaShamba where it is intended to build a fire temple.But within three months there was a sad article in the same news-paper (5 October 1901) headed ‘The Rage of the Mob’:A Parsee Priest was nearly killed by the town’s people on Saturdayafternoon. To touch one of the mob is like putting fire to dry Makuti(coconut) leaves. The cry was caught up and spread from man to man,from woman to child, that the priest was bleeding children and makingtheir blood into medicine. The shouting was blood curdling, they sworethe bodies or heads were then thrown down an old disused well. Thepolice tried lowering candles, but they all went out and then hurricanelamps, but the air was too foul to let a man down. They have nearlykilled the priest who lives in a terrible state covered with weals fromheavy sticks. Some of the rioters have been arrested; perhaps the riotwas got up to cover robberies that occur from time to time on the road.Two weeks later (19 October) the same newspaper reported:We regret to report that the Parsee priest who was so roughly handledby the mob, the other day, continues to get fever. It is feared a change ofair will be necessary for his recovery. The Parsee temple at Makupa,meanwhile is deserted.Two years later (28 November 1903), the newspaper reportedthe arrival of a new priest. He came as the guest of MessrsR. N. Talati and Co. The paper concluded: ‘We hope that theArabs and Africans will look upon the reverend gentleman asthe “sacred man” of the East, and cause no more riot or tumultZoroastrians in East Africa291158Fourteen children; twelve men, nine women—one identified as dying in childbirth."},{"pageNumber":311,"pageContent":"as they did last year.’ A week later (5 December 1903), the paperrecorded a much happier event, what is likely to have been thefirst naujoteon the mainland of Africa:the Navjote ceremonies of the two youngsters of Mr Framji EdaljiPundole, Cashier of HM’s Customs, were successfully performed in hisbungalow...by the Parsi priest in the presence of a large assemblageof the Parsi ladies and gentlemen. After the ceremonies, the ladies andgentlemen were served with some light refreshments, such as cakes,wines, ice-cream, &c., the party dispersed late in the evening. A Swahiliband, to charm and cheer the spectators, was in attendance.159The employment of a priest so early in the Mombasa community’shistory indicates that a high priority was given to religious practice.The Pundoles were clearly some of the early professional settlers inMombasa. Having their children’s naujotein Mombasa rather thanon a visit back to Bombay may also be taken as an indication of theintention to settle, and the Swahili dance band may indicate that thefamily were prepared to accept a small element of African culture.One prominent Parsi in the early part of the century wasCowasji M. Dalal, who was first mentioned as a pleader in theMombasa Indian Trading Association in 1905. He was one of thefirst Indians to be nominated to the Kenya Legislative Council,but he resigned in 1920 in protest at the British refusal to acknow-ledge the Indian electoral rights.160Another Parsi to rise to localpolitical prominence was H. H. Mody, who became a member ofthe Mombasa Municipal Board in 1938.161Two Parsis played an important role in developing Asian cricketin Mombasa and beyond. The East African Standard(20 November1937) included a paragraph on the first of these:There has just retired from the services of the National Bank of Indiaone who has done much to foster cricket in Kenya. He is Mr BurjorjiM. Commissariat of Mombasa. Mr Burjorji Commissariat first came toMombasa some thirty years ago, and for practically the whole of thatperiod he has held the post of cashier with the Bank.When Mr Commissariat first came to Mombasa cricket was at a lowebb. Under his helpful interest the game soon took firm root, and muchof its progress today, not only at the Coast, but also in Kenya and EastAfrica generally, has been due to his efforts.Zoroastrians in East Africa292159The newspaper reports are included in C.

In recognition of his services to cricket he was elected an hon-orary life member of the Club, an honour which has been accorded tono other member of the Asian community.162The other prominent Parsi cricketer was E. P. Nowrojee,a lawyer by profession, who captained the Asian cricket team andafter much pressure persuaded the Europeans that they shouldhave an annual three-day cricket match, the first being held in1933. The fact that previous approaches had been rebuffed is anindication of the way Whites kept themselves at a distance fromAsians, even as opponents in sports.163Later two Parsis played forthe Kenyan cricket team ( Jehangir Austin and Savak K. Talavia).Several Parsis undertook social work in the wider community.164The typically Parsi Dramatic Society was strong in Mombasa fromthe 1930s, and its popularity in wider society meant that itsfunctions could be used for fundraising.165Perhaps the individualto achieve greatest prominence in Mombasa society was Erach R.Avari. As well as being active in the Social Service League, andin the running of the Pandya Memorial Hospital, he becamechairman of the Indian Association for six years. Dara Patel (myinformant) was a follower of Jomo Kenyatta, became treasurer ofthe Mombasa branch of the Kenya African National Union, andworked as publicity secretary in the election campaign prior toIndependence. He was active in the opposition to the ceding ofthe East Coast strip to Zanzibar. In his visits to Zanzibar for thenegotiations, ironically, he was debating with two Parsis, RustomSidhwa for the Afro-Shirazi party and Ratti Bulsara for theNationalist Party, another example of Parsis being loyal to theircountry rather than giving priority to communal ties. He and hiswife were invited to the flag-raising ceremony at Independence, andZoroastrians in East Africa293162Quoted in Salvadori,We Came in Dhows, p. 164.163Salvadori,We Came in Dhows, p. 165.164Dr Nariman A.

He was one of the first KenyanIndians who applied for Kenyan citizenship after Independence.Mombasa Parsis’ land and institutionsLand was donated to the community. The firm Cowasji Dinshawand Bros. of Aden, in 1897, gave land in the vicinity of the cemet-ery, and Sorabji Mistry similarly gave nearby land. Bhedwar thenerected, at the community’s expense, a building in which religiousceremonies such as initiations, weddings and funerals could beconducted. Another Parsi, Edalji Sopariwalla, dug a sweet-waterwell, for the pure water needed in the ceremonies. The whole areabecame known as the Parsi Shemba, Swahili for Parsi Baug. Aspart of its administrative role in connection with the property, theAnjuman adopted its first constitution in 1910. This was not fullyregistered with government, and a further one was drawn upin 1945 that corrected this state of affairs. One change in theconstitution was that the franchise was given to women. Overthe years a dozen women have held offices, including those ofsecretary,166and chairperson.167In the post-war period, when thecommunity is estimated to have grown to over 300, there havebeen several building projects. In 1931 a building was erectedwhich was intended for accommodation, but it was leased to theGovernment to house the Government Indian ElementarySchool. The income from this ensured a stable economic condi-tion for the community until the building was vacated in the1960s. In 1948 the foundation-stone was laid for a buildingcontaining six rental flats. In 1959 and 1978 further buildingswere opened for accommodation and in 1963 a rest house. Oneplot of land was sold in 1976, and the funds used to develop themain site with a prayer hall and to add further accommodationabove the rest house. The Parsi complex, therefore, consists of sixbuildings and a nearby cemetery.Religion among Mombasa ParsisObviously the liturgical life of the community could not be as fullas that in Zanzibar, because of the lack of a fully fledged temple.Zoroastrians in East Africa294166The first was Mrs Najoo E. Avari in 1980.167Dr (Mrs) Homai Engineer in 1984."},{"pageNumber":314,"pageContent":"Nevertheless, the traditions have been observed as strictly aspossible. Priests have been employed from India by providing themwith work in one of the Parsi-run firms. Traditionally the commun-ity has tried to have two priests, as two are required for certain cer-emonies (notably funerals), but as numbers decreased in the lateryears this has not always been possible. The descriptions of thefuneral ceremonies contained in extant sources and reports,namely the drawing of the ring with an iron nail round the body,the bringing-in of the dog, the position of the corpse, the use ofclean but old clothing, are traditional even though the circum-stances meant that the dead had to be buried. The use of picturesof the Prophet, or of Zoroastrian holy men, and the burning ofthedivoin the home, are common. The leaders have commonlylooked for traditional priests. Many look back to the early 1960s,when there were nearly 350 Parsis in Mombasa, as a golden period.The older generation still in Mombasa see it as a time of activity, andas a time of less in-fighting than there was in the 1980s.Mombasa Parsis in the 1980sSubscription lists indicate a Parsi population of approximatelyseventy individuals. The majority of the community were of theolder generation, since their children had sought education inBritain or America, and settled there. The outflow of Parsis to theWest had, therefore, continued since the 1960s, though in lessdramatic fashion. All but six families lived within the complex.A search through the address list showed that there weretwenty-eight family units. Of these, ten consisted of single personsand eight of widowed people. Twenty-five people were over theage of 60 and six families had children under the age of 21. Sixfamilies had no children. Thirty-one individuals were born in EastAfrica; twenty-nine in India. Nine families had children living inthe West. Two individuals had married Hindus, but only one keptin contact with the community. Two men had married Muslimsand two others had converted to Islam. There was one Christiannun of Parsi birth. Only three Parsis had moved to Mombasasince 1964.LeadershipOne theme to emerge throughout this book is the balancebetween religious and secular leadership. The first paid priest,Zoroastrians in East Africa295"},{"pageNumber":315,"pageContent":"Ervad Charna, was brought to Mombasa in 1909. In 1911 therewere two honorary priests, the Jina brothers, who both workedas clerks in Mombasa. In 1940 priestly resources were depletedand Ervad Jal Karkaria stood alone, although a lay elder of thecommunity stood with him at funerals.168He left Mombasaand moved to London in the 1970s, where he continued toserve the community as a priest. His brother, Dara, returnedto India in 1981. Maintaining a religious leadership in a smalldiaspora group is an acute problem. It is not simply the costof maintaining a priest, for if that were so then jobs could befound. Nor is it merely a matter of the mobed not being availableif he is engaged in secular work. The problem is that the priest’spurity is difficult to maintain while he is involved in a normal,secular life. There is also the obvious point that although theneed for a priest can be urgent at certain times, for example atthe time of a death, in a small community such a need arisesonly occasionally. For example in 1987 (the last year for whichI have records) the Sukesh prayer hall was booked out on onlyseven occasions. Two of those were private parties, the otherswere jashans.Community leadership in all diaspora groups is in the handsof lay people. Commonly the person chosen to be president, orchair, is the person thought best able to present the communityto the outside world. In a community with many of its membersable to do this, the tension between potential leaders for what isseen as a position of prestige can be intense. In Mombasa, asin Zanzibar and other centres discussed, this has been a problemand was a particularly acute one in 1987–8. There were acri-monious disputes between the trustees and the ManagingCommittee. In part these were personality clashes, but there wasalso a question of principle. Where did authority lie in the callingand running of meetings? Who had the authority to keep therecords, to fix rents in community flats and authorize repairs? Thedispute raged so fiercely at one meeting that the police were askedto intervene.169Eventually the matter was referred to the DistrictZoroastrians in East Africa296168‘Standing’ in a ceremony is a common Zoroastrian phrase. Much of the time at afuneral the priest is literally standing, but the term is also used for rituals such as the jashanwhere much of the time is spent seated on the floor.169See letter of protests from the Managing Committee to the Attorney-General inNairobi dated 8 Sept. 1987, copied to the Provincial Commissioner, District"},{"pageNumber":316,"pageContent":"Officer’s Office, and the African District Officer was brought in tochair a meeting to seek reconciliation in the Parsi community.After three warnings the District Officer had to cancel the meet-ing because of disorder. He therefore ruled that the ManagingCommittee had shown that it could not in practice run theAnjuman, so he dissolved it and handed authority over to thetrustees; another election for a new managing committee washeld.170The problems did not, however, disappear. The community wasdeeply divided and disputes continued over matters largeand small, as each side took up the cudgels against the other.Obviously this is a sad state of affairs, given the diminishingnumbers of the small community living so closely together in thecomplex, yet in the midst of a very different culture.Parsis in NairobiMy principle source for this section is a collection of over 3,000microfiche records of the Managing Committee, AGM files,copies of circulars and varied correspondence, all kindly madeavailable for me by Mr Dolassa in Nairobi. As these are officialcommunity records, minutes approved by subsequent meetings,they clearly have a degree of impartiality or objectivity. Yet evenhere, one has to recognize possible bias. In Nairobi, as elsewhere,there have been factions, and the records represent the views ofthose in office. As noted elsewhere, such records generally tend togive a rather bland account so that one has to be alert to sense anyalternative interpretations.Pre-Independence NairobiDarukhanawala reports that when he visited Nairobi at the startof the twentieth century there were twenty Parsis there.171One hementions is Seth Gandhi, a lawyer; he also refers to railway workers,to someone who ran a ‘home distillery’ and to some accountants;‘There used to be a Parsee hotel but it no longer exists ...’.Whilein Nairobi, Darukhanawala sought to buy land there but wasZoroastrians in East Africa297Commissioner, Provincial CID officer, Principal State Counsel and the Makupa policestation in Mombasa.

D. Shroff (dated 16 August1962), seeking funding. The Anjuman was established in 1904‘by a handful of Parsis’. Nairobi was, in those days, just a smalltown of tents and tin shanties with a sprinkling of Asians andEuropeans. A funeral ground was obtained, a move triggered bytwo deaths. A Parsi advocate practising in Nairobi, P. K. Ghandy,purchased four acres in Quarry Road, built a corrugated ironbuilding on the site and presented the whole to the community inmemory of his late wife. The site had no electricity, water or san-itation. In 1918 two Parsis died in a flu epidemic, and from dona-tions at their uthamnaceremonies funds were raised for a well. Thesite was the only asset of the Anjuman and so it was maintainedby voluntary contributions. Other early pioneers mentioned byinformants, with their diverse careers, are Dinshaw ByramjeeRanderia, who came as a railway engineer in 1892 but turned toreal estate in 1907; Sorabji Hooker, who was in business in Nairobiin approximately 1900; and Cowasjee Khambata, who ran a curioshop at about the same time. Names from the second decade of thetwentieth century include Dinshaw Mehta, a cashier of theNational Bank in 1911; Jehangir Ghadialy, who came as a watch-maker and dealer in 1912; Nariman D. Mehta, who arrived in1915 as a government court clerk; Homi N. Modi, who started animport and export trade in 1918; and Naoroji and Vakil, who cameas railway driver and bank cashier respectively, also in 1918. Thislist shows the great diversity of businesses and professions of theearly settlers—they were lawyers, clerks, businessmen and railwaydrivers. It is difficult to categorize this early Nairobi community asclearly as was possible for the communities in Hong Kong, Karachior Zanzibar. By the 1930s it became more professional, with morelawyers, doctors and dentists as well as businessmen.In 1932 further funds were collected to replace the dilapidatediron building with a stone one, where death ceremonies andjashanscould be performed.

Unfortunately‘some personal differences of opinion’ arose between members ofthe two Associations—the Nairobi Parsee Anjuman and the newParsee Zoroastrian Association of Kenya. The two plots admin-istered by the two Associations, the old cemetery and thenew ‘social structure’, were 3 miles apart, which increased main-tenance costs. The bare bones of this, and subsequent historycontained in the letter, can be ‘fleshed out’ from other sources.Unlike the early records of the Parsee Anjuman, the files ofthe Parsee Zoroastrian Association of Kenya records are extant.The founding meeting took place on 25 February 1942 to ‘pro-mote religious and social interest among the community; toincrease fraternity and to become more religious and social’.173Such a body had been attempted in the 1930s, but lack of fundsand co-operation are said to have resulted in its premature demise.It was agreed that women were to have free membership, butcould not vote. It was also agreed that any Parsi Zoroastrian coulduse the facilities, whether or not they were members of theAssociation.174At the original founding of the Association therewere twenty-nine members, which quickly rose to fifty-five, a sub-stantial proportion of the community.175The land was actuallyallocated by the Government on 12 August of that year.176Thefull plans for a rest house and a social building could not be imple-mented because of the shortage of materials due to the war, butthe foundation stone of the Avanbai D. Byramjee rest house waslaid on 18 October 1942. When the Association found it did nothave the money to complete the building, the Byramjee familyundertook to do so. The rest house was opened with a jashan, andwas said to be a ‘place of our own wherein we can have our social,religious and other functions’. Until a separate hall could be built,the main hall of the rest house was to be used as a club hallfor the use of Parsis only, according to the by-laws. Chairs, cardtables and table tennis tables were donated. Some newspaperswere subscribed to.

On the rentalside, matters started well. The two rooms were rented out quiteregularly, because during the war people could not easily travel toIndia and therefore looked for somewhere to stay that was saferthan the port of Mombasa. The rest house’s first Annual Reportmentions visitors from Mombasa, Eldoret, Zanzibar, Arusha andMogadishu. The rental money provided an income for maintain-ing the premises. In the early 1940s the rest house was used whenmany women and children of all communities were evacuatedfrom the coastal city of Mombasa because the port was thoughtto be under naval threat from the German fleet.179In a letterdated 16 April 1943 the secretary of the Mombasa Anjumanexplained that they were having to evacuate two women, eighty-two children and two infirm men. He asked the Nairobi Parsiswhether they could provide transit camps if they could not findhomes for them all. In the end not all of these people came toNairobi. The sports facilities were not, however, a success andpeople complained at the poor standards.180By 1950 problemswere emerging with the building. Owing to deterioration, extens-ive work was required and a lack of funds prevented the buildingof flats for the priest or for rental.181But social relations wereimproving, for a ‘mass meeting’ of the Parsis of Nairobi agreed toa report calling for the amalgamation of the two Associations,which despite an earlier tumultuous meeting, was agreed to inNovember 1950.182Zoroastrians in East Africa300177Second Annual Report for the year ending 31 Dec. 1943, tabled at the AGM,25 Feb. 1944.

The numbers exceeded 200. In 1963there were 109 males, 108 females. The age distribution was:0–15 years, 48 persons; 16–55, 143 persons; 56 and over, 26persons.183The social calendar for that year indicated one eventper month, specifically seven jashans, one gahambarfeast, No Ruz,two purely social dinners and a children’s fireworks party. Socialfunctions included table tennis, whist drives and picnic parties.

True to theZoroastrian tradition of loyalty to the ruling authorities, the Parsiswelcomed the new Government and publicly pledged theirloyalty.

For example, in a message sentthrough diplomatic channels, and to the press, they reported theAnjuman resolution of thanks for:the wise and dedicated leadership...and the stability and prosperity thathas been a consequence of Your Excellency’s statesmanship....Intheircontinuing tradition of loyalty to the popularly elected Government ofKenya, the Parsis vehemently condemn the recent conspiracy to over-throw the Government by unlawful means.

The first time this processis referred to in the records is in the 1967–8 Annual Report, whereit is stated that twenty-eight members had left for Britain.190In thesecretary’s report for July 1971–4 (an Annual Report was notissued in that period) it was noted that fourteen families, com-prising forty-seven persons, plus one bachelor, had left. Within thefollowing few months three more members with three childrenleft, making a total of fifty-three persons. The Parsi populationwas then reported as being 100, thirty-eight males, thirty-threefemales and twenty-nine children, four of whom were stationedoutside Nairobi. A further six members were expected to leaveshortly. The secretary’s report for 1974–5 noted that in that yearanother seventeen persons left, so that the community now num-bered only eighty-three people—thirty-three males, thirty-onefemales and nineteen children. Most people migrated to Britainand some went to India. There was an interesting initiative fromIran: Farhang Mehr191wrote on 19 August 1968, regarding helpfor Parsis wishing to go to Iran. The problem of the community’sdiminishing numbers was exacerbated by the fact that thenumber of deaths exceeded the number of births in this ageingcommunity.192The departures created managerial problems, because some ofthose departing were committee members, including a chairman.One consequence was that the size of the Managing Committeehad to be reduced from twelve to nine. So at the AGM on 17 April1970, the chairman urged those remaining to be more active inthe Anjuman. He appealed to ‘all those who are still here and toZoroastrians in East Africa303189Such communal letters of condolence had been customary in Nairobi. For example,on 5 Feb. 1948 the Anjuman had sent a condolence letter to Nehru following Gandhi’sdeath. Similarly a letter of concern and good wishes was sent to the Secretary of State forthe Colonies when the King was ill and on 22 Oct. 1951; a condolence letter was sent tothe Central Muslim Association in Nairobi on the death of Liaquat Ali Khan.190Tabled at the AGM, 6 Apr. 1968.191On Mehr’s role as Deputy Prime Minister in Iran see Ch. 8 on America, below.192Reports to the AGMs of 30 May 1983 and 16 May 1986."},{"pageNumber":323,"pageContent":"those who have or will make this country as their home, should onall occasions come out in full force and lend their support in thecauses that are being undertaken not only for our Community butalso the Country’s National occasions.’There were social consequences of the departures, as theAnnual Reports show: the level of activity in the social calendardecreased, with fewer dinners and jashans. They also had signific-ant economic implications. The number of subscriptions dimin-ished. Fewer people were coming to Nairobi and staying in the resthouse, so that income declined, yet the standing charges andwages of staff had to be paid. In 1971 the rest house was renov-ated, and there was inconclusive discussion on whether to rent outthe property.193The cost of maintaining the property was notsmall—for example, in 1986 the cemetery wall had to be rebuiltwhen heavy rains caused it to collapse.194But the problems weregreater than that. Previously, land used for religious purposes wasnot taxed. This changed, and site value rates were imposed. As thecity grew, so land values rose and therefore taxes increased. Afterannual appeals from the Managing Committee to secure alternat-ive funding, for example by seeking a mortgage to increasethe number of flats for rental at the rest house, the decision waseventually taken unanimously in 1977 to sell the rest house.195Atthe Managing Committee meeting on 12 August that year it was reported that the property had been sold, at the upper end ofthe scale sought, to the Sikh group, the East African NamdhariSangat.196In one sense the position post-1977 was similar to that of the1930s, in terms of numbers and assets. But in other ways the situ-ation was very different. During the period of British rule, theParsis in Kenya, as in much of the Empire, considered them-selves somewhat apart from other Asian groups and closer tothe British on the social ladder. Rightly or wrongly, they typicallyfelt secure and successful. The social and political context underBlack rule in Africa was seen by many of them as different. Fromthe 1970s there were no really wealthy Parsis who could sponsorbuildings, events and religious resources.

It is interesting to notewhich charities were chosen. These were Mother Teresa’s home,the Fatima Children’s Home, the Society for the Deaf andDumb, and the children’s cancer ward at the Kenya NationalHospital. In the first allocation the last two were replaced by theLeague of Friends’ fund for wheelchairs for spinal injuries, andthe Kenya Ear Fund, which was carrying out a number of earoperations.199When a Parsi couple who had left Kenya andreturned to India wanted to donate to a charity as a token ofthanks to the Kenya Anjuman, the Indian charity chosen was theParsee General Hospital.200Currency regulations preventedKenyan Parsis from making direct donations to charities in India,but the priorities chosen were typical of traditional values—medicine, especially treatment for the poor in society at large.There is also a clear example of Parsi charity for which, to myknowledge, no records are extant. The Dinshaw Byramjee FreeDispensary was founded by the Byramjee family, but was rununder the Social Services League, overseen by three Parsitrustees. Charity was, typically for Parsis, written into the 1965Anjuman constitution—the fourth of a long list of aims andobjectives was ‘to render assistance to the disabled or destitutecitizens of Kenya’.Monetary problems remained, however, for the small commun-ity, which lacked major sponsors. Consequently, in the 1980sdebates grew about the option to sell off part of the funeralgrounds. The first minuted reference to this discussion is fromMarch 1987—when an approach was reported to the Ismailicommunity whose cemetery was nearby, and who required morespace. The proposal was to sell off two-and-a-half acres, leavingthe Parsis with one-and-a-half. There was some objection atZoroastrians in East Africa305197Managing Committee Minutes, 5 Dec. 1977.198Minutes of the AGM, 16 Mar. 1981.199Managing Committee Minutes, 17 May 1987.200Managing Committee Minutes, 7 May 1988."},{"pageNumber":325,"pageContent":"the meetings on the grounds that the land might be needed. Thecounter-argument was that maintenance costs were high, the Parsinumbers were decreasing and there was the risk that the landmight be encroached upon, or taken away, so that the communitywould get nothing for it. An alternative suggestion was to rentsome of the land to the Ismailis for them to use as a car park.Eventually the decision was taken to sell.201Intermarriage and other disputesThe debate on the sale of part of the funeral grounds becameembroiled with another, wider, and potentially more divisive,issue, namely intermarriage. Part of the unease about the sale ofthe land to the Ismailis arose from the fact that one member of theZoroastrian community involved in the debate was married to anIsmaili who came to some functions with her. Intermarriage withmembers of other Indian communities was probably more wide-spread than the official record acknowledges. In-marriage is diffi-cult in a small and dwindling community. Relations with otherIndian groups were mixed. At a purely social level, my informantstell me, there was socializing, for example on public occasions, atDiwali, in sports and occasionally in politics. Some saw closeIndian ties as dangerous. So in 1962, Hoshang Shroff wrote a let-ter of protest to the secretary of the Anjuman, expressing concernthat collecting money to aid India in her distress might give theGovernment in Kenya the impression ‘that our emotional ties arestill very strong with our country of origin rather than with Kenyaand that we have not sufficiently clearly identified ourselves withAfrican nationalism’.202The earliest minuted indication of the problem of intermar-riage was made in 1970, when some people objected to thepresence of non-Parsis at a funeral.203When the priest learnedof their presence he condemned this ‘serious breach in religiousdiscipline’. The Managing Committee agreed to circulate thisrebuke to the whole community. When the priest, Ervad SoliRabady, eventually left for India, the layman who stood for him inZoroastrians in East Africa306201Managing Committee Minutes, 7 Mar. 1987; 17 May 1987.202Letter in Anjuman files, dated 2 Nov. 1962.203My sources inform me that the problem related to the presence of a non-Parsi familymember of an intermarried person."},{"pageNumber":326,"pageContent":"ceremonies, Mr Byramjee, made it clear that he would notaccept such a presence either.204Because of one particular intermarriage, the Anjuman secret-ary wrote to the secretary of the Bombay Parsi Punchayet foradvice. In return he was sent the judgement of several BombayHigh Priests. Three of them, Dasturs Dabu, H. N. K. Dastur ofPoona and Minocherhomji, argued that those married by theSpecial Marriages Act of 1954 were not required to renouncetheir religion.Therefore, if she (or he) was born a Parsi, duly admitted to the Zoroastrianfold by Navjote rite continues to remain a Zoroastrian—then she is aParsi Zoroastrian...Where the ceremony of marriage has been carriedout in accordance with some other religion...naturally she is supposedto owe allegiance to another prophet, and she cannot remain a ParsiZoroastrian. She goes out of our fold entirely.205Three other Dasturs, Dasturs Mirza, JamaspAsa and K. M. Kutar,argued that the person who has married out, even under theSpecial Marriages Act, has taken him or her self out of the com-munity: ‘According to Zoroastrian religion marriage is NOT a civilcontract, it is a religious sacrament...If a Zoroastrian (male orfemale) marries in any other way, he or she discards the importantsacrament of the Zoroastrian religion, and thus forsakes theReligion and the Community.’ Mirza’s long letter concludes withthe observation that because of the purity laws, if a Zoroastrianmale or female ‘comes in marital intercourse with a non-Zoroastrian, he or she cannot observe the rules of ritual purity ofZoroastrian religion...Such a person goes out of the Zoroastrianfold and the Parsi community.’206The Anjuman also approachedsome of the High Priests directly, namely Mirza, JamaspAsa andDabu.207Their replies to Nairobi were consistent with their adviceto Bombay, though less detailed. The Anjuman also sought theguidance of a leading Parsi lawyer, Prof. P. K. Irani, Dean of Lawat Bombay University. He advised:A Zoroastrian lady (or gentleman) marrying a non-Zoroastrian willcontinue to be a Zoroastrian and, therefore, entitled to be a member ofZoroastrians in East Africa307204Managing Committee Minutes, 7 Oct. and 6 Nov. 1970; for Byramjee see AGM9 Nov. 1984.205Quotation taken from the response of Dastur Dabu dated 5 Aug. 1964.206Letter dated 15 Sept. 1964.207Replies to Nairobi dated 18 Oct. 1969, 10 Oct. and 22 Sept. 1969 respectively."},{"pageNumber":327,"pageContent":"the Parsee Zoroastrian Anjuman as long as she (or he) does notembrace another religion...On her demise, such a lady, is entitled tothe benefit of the religious ceremony of ‘Gehsarnu’ and the same canbe performed by a Zoroastrian priests.But he also pointed out that the children of any intermarriedZoroastrian woman could not be taken into the Zoroastrian religion.208Religion and Nairobi ParsisIt is difficult to say a great deal about the religion in Nairobi,because the sources are not specific. The conflicts over intermar-riage suggest a strong traditional element. This is reflected also inthe verbal descriptions I have been given of the practices: therefusal of the priestly deputy to say the funeral prayers at acremation; how he scrubbed with disinfectant chairs that hadbeen sat on by the family of an intermarried member. Care wascommonly taken not to leave cut hair or nails around. The explana-tion in the records is that they might be used for voodoo, but inhistorical terms this amounts to a preservation of the traditionalpurity laws. The anecdotal evidence I have is that a number ofpeople, especially the elders, pray five times daily and some keepa fire burning in their home, or at least have a divo. One of theleaders has related privately that his wife continues the traditionof carrying the fire around the house morning and evening topurify the home. The manner in which funerals are carried out isalso as traditional as circumstances allow, with a circle markedaround the corpse with an iron nail, and a dog brought into thepresence of the deceased. As the younger people leave, so theremay be a tendency for the traditional ways to remain strong in thedwindling community.The traditional nature of the community is reflected in itsattitude to priests. The priestly–lay relations in Nairobi are inmarked contrast to those which developed in Zanzibar. The thirdpriest to serve in Nairobi, Soli Rabady, arrived in 1921 and serveduntil 1981. Both in the Annual Reports, and in the function tohonour him on his departure for India, the tone is consistentlyZoroastrians in East Africa308208Letter dated 14 Mar. 1970. Irani also refers to an article he had written on ‘Thepersonal law of Parsis in India’, in a book published by Allen and Unwin in 1968,FamilyLaw in Asia and Africa."},{"pageNumber":328,"pageContent":"warm and respectful. He had had secular employment. He cameto Nairobi—where his brother had been performing the cere-monies—to work in the Supreme Court. In 1933 he was trans-ferred to a government school, but after a short spell in Ugandahe opened his own school in 1950.209Zoroastrians are typically proud of the fact that their religionhas commonly been more open to women’s roles than most otherreligions. This has been the case in Nairobi since the 1950s. In theoriginal Anjuman women could not vote in elections nor beelected to office. But after the amalgamation with the Associationin 1950 women both had the vote and could stand for office. Theattendance lists of functions in the 1950s, including meetingson crucial issues such as the amalgamation, show that womencomposed between one-third and a half of people present.210In1981 Mrs A. M. Dastoor was elected chair of the ManagingCommittee; at the same time Mrs B. K. J. Contractor became sec-retary for four years, and she in turn was succeeded by a woman.In terms of the purity laws, however, the usual situation is thaton communal occasions women do not go to the funeral ground(or the kitchen) during menstruation.One problem has been that with dwindling numbers andresources, the social life of the community has suffered. Oneattempt to counteract this has been ‘Meet and Greet’. This is an informal arrangement, involving no committee, where families take it in turn to host lunches on the first Sunday in eachmonth. The hosts organize the function, arrange for cutlery, etc.,provide dessert and refreshments, and members bring the actuallunch.Nairobi Zoroastrians in the late 1980sThere were at the close of the 1980s sixty-three Zoroastrians inNairobi, sixty adults and three minors. None of these was under10 years of age, but thirty-one were over the age of 50 (seventeenover the age of 60). It is therefore an elderly, and progressivelyageing, community. One in five of the community had a universitydegree or professional qualification, but relatively few were in theprofessions (five, including three teachers). The majority (seventeen)Zoroastrians in East Africa309209Record of a function dated 21 June 1981, in his honour.210Parsee Zoroastrian Association of Kenya, Special General Meeting, 18 Oct. 1942;the AGM on 28 Jan. 1943; the AGM on 25 Sept. 1953."},{"pageNumber":329,"pageContent":"were in self-owned businesses, with four business executives.

It is therefore of some interestand value. Eleven of my respondents had been born in India aretwo were born in Britain. There were no respondents fromPakistan, or Iran. Nine of my respondents had moved to Kenyabefore the 1960s, but eight had settled after the period of‘Africanization’, so the story is not simply one of emigration. Thetables in Appendix 2, Table 1: 1–37 use percentage figures for allgroups discussed. This is questionable with the Kenyan samplebecause it was so small. In what follows actual ‘hard’ numbers willbe used. Most of my respondents were aged 50 or older; nineteenof them were in this age bracket, whereas ten were in their thirtiesor forties and only one was under 20. Most respondents (twenty-four) were married, only four were single and there was onewidowed person. Two of my respondents had married out of thecommunity. In the early history of Parsis in East Africa, extendedfamilies were common; that is no longer the case. Twenty-six ofmy respondents were from nuclear families, only four were part ofan extended family. The change was due to the departure of somany people in the 1960s. In contrast to western Zoroastriandiasporas, the majority of my respondents from Kenya had con-cluded their education at school level [N \u000218]. Only elevenZoroastrians in East Africa310211These figures were kindly supplied by Mr Dolassa and analysed by Ms NyrmlaSingh.212In other chapters figures from my survey have come at the beginning of the chapterfollowed by a discussion of how this situation came to pass, and what has happened since,because the 1980s—when my survey was undertaken—has internationally been a keydecade for Zoroastrians.

Twenty four of the twenty-eightpeople who answered the question on prayer said that they prayeddaily. The majority (eighteen) described themselves as religiouslyLiberal; seven described themselves as Orthodox and four saidthat they did not practice the religion.

The majority of respondents (nineteen) saidthat they accepted intermarriage, whereas twelve said that theyobjected to it, although most people (fourteen) said that the priestsshould not perform such weddings.

The earliest arrivals were professionals, butover a decade the settlement grew more into a business commun-ity. Under the British, they saw themselves as part of the estab-lishment in the Emerald Isle, and then as fulfilling a role in thedevelopment of the East African Railway and the consequentgrowth in Mombasa and Nairobi. They were conscious of theirseparate identity, not only from Blacks and the British, but alsofrom other Indian communities. The links with Indian Parsishave remained strong from the earliest days, when many returnedto the old country for retirement, until the approach of themillennium when the community turned to Bombay High Priestsfor direction. The primary focus of their charitable work wasIndia. Throughout this book Parsis have been seen to be loyal tothe government of the day, wherever they have lived. Those whofelt unable to give that loyalty after Independence left, mostly tosettle in Britain. Those who remained have publicly identifiedwith their new government. There are now effectively no Parsiresidents in Zanzibar (following the revolution) the island whichhad been the hub of the Parsi East African network because ofits temple and priest. In Kenya, the Parsi population is ageingand declining. As so often in the Parsi universe, the community isdeeply divided, not least over questions of intermarriage andbecause of personality clashes. But the religion is strong amongmost Parsis, and in its practices and beliefs is characteristicallytraditional or Orthodox.Zoroastrians in East Africa312"},{"pageNumber":332,"pageContent":"Forgotten ParsisWritten histories typically focus on institutions and formal associ-ations. It is rare for the isolated or quiet people to form part ofa historical account. Fortunately, Salvadori’s collection of mem-oirs includes some of these ‘forgotten people’. It is appropriate toend this chapter with two such stories of Parsis not associated withany Anjuman but who lived a good and quiet life.The following was related to Salvadori by Eddie S. Pereiraconcerning his first visit to Fort Hall, a small town 60 miles northof Nairobi, in 1934. There he visited the native hospital:It was run by a Parsie [sic] doctor, Dastur, a wonderful man. His title waswrong; he was called Sub Assistant Surgeon but that was because he was anIndian with a degree in medicine from Bombay. He was in fact the DistrictMedical Officer. Dr Dastur and my father were the only two tennis players;later I was taught tennis by Dr Dastur. And we played chess too...Dr Dastur’s wife had a piano in the house and we both played it.213Salvadori includes selections from a thirty-page report written byDr Dastur, ‘The annual Medical report for Baringo District andthe Native Hospital Kabarnet from 1935’, based on six ‘safaris’ hehad conducted into the remote areas that year.214Dastur moved toEast Africa after his marriage in 1932 and lived there until he diedin 1941, leaving a widow and three children. When the war brokeout he joined the Army Medical Corps, but never left Kenya.Dinshaw S. Talati lived in Faza, the main town on Pate Island,a four-hour boat journey from Lamu. He was the son of aZanzibar pioneer, Shapurji Talati. He opened a clothing shop inFaza; he rarely left his home, but was respected by all who methim. He gave credit (without charging interest) to those in need.He lived quietly, alone—he never married, but was liked by all.How many more were there like Dinshah whose quiet lives werenever recorded in AGM meetings?215Zoroastrians in East Africa313213Salvadori,We Came in Dhows, pp. 34 f.214Ibid., pp. 140 f.215Ibid., pp. 114 f."},{"pageNumber":333,"pageContent":"7The Zoroastrian Trust Funds of EuropeMy previous book,Zoroastrians in Britain, covers much of the groundin this chapter but the publishers thought that there was merit inhaving this subject treated inside the same covers as the studies ofthe other diaspora communities.1Certainly it makes this bookmore self-standing, and facilitates comparison between the diversecommunities in the West. As London is home to the oldestZoroastrian community in the western world, and has the largestZoroastrian population outside the old countries, it would havebeen strange to have omitted the subject. Its inclusion also bringsthe material up to date, for the research for the earlier book onlywent as far as 1994, and much that is important has happenedsince then, both within the community and in scholarship.

Nevertheless, froman outside historian’s perspective, although it is essential to valuetheir own assessment of their identity, their migration to Britainhas to be understood against the background of (South) Asianmigration to Britain, because the history of their migration is partof that wider history; they have been subject to the same immig-ration laws and race relations policy.Britain has been a destination for migrants from at least Romantimes, followed by Saxons, Normans and others. Because of thehistory of the British Empire, South Asians have been travelling toBritain for longer than to any other western country. From the sev-enteenth century wealthy British families returned from Asiabringing servants, or ‘pets’, who were sometimes sold on virtuallyas slaves. From the eighteenth century South Asians came as sea-men (or lascars) who left their ships while in British ports. Theywere stereotypically seen as poverty-stricken individuals, criminals,people who went with white prostitutes, producing half-breed chil-dren who embodied the sins of both parents. Lascars were there-fore seen as threatening the purity of the British race. South Asianswere regarded as pedlars, or as the ‘coolies of the Empire’. Therewas a contrasting image of the fabulously wealthy princes, mostlyfrom India and Iran, who were seen visiting royalty and leading fig-ures in British society. Those able to glimpse this other side ofBritish life thus saw Asians as polarized between the sophisticatedupper classes and the menial, poverty-stricken ignorant masses,and associated them with the images of the heathen worship ofmany gods reported by early missionaries. These proved to be last-ing impressions on the British public.2The soldiers, administratorsand missionaries of the Empire conveyed both in South Asia andin Britain their perception of themselves as ‘bearing the Whiteman’s burden’ in directing the affairs of the natives ‘for their owngood’. They also saw the Empire as being a resource for the goodof Britain.The Zoroastrian Trust Funds of Europe3152The literature is extensive and this is not the place for a full bibliography.

There was some concern among theBritish political leaders that such students would collaborate withradicals and Communists among the student body and fomentrevolution. There were huge changes in attitudes and settlementpatterns following the Second World War. A number of peoplewho had served in the Medical Corps joined the emergingNational Health Service, and others who had fought for the Alliessettled in Britain, for at that time any citizen in the Empire hadthe right to travel and settle. Another major factor for change wasthe urgent British need for workers to replace the many youngsoldiers who had died in the war. Recruitment drives were under-taken mostly in the Caribbean and South Asia for manual workersto carry out the labouring tasks the White British did not want,but which were vital in the effort to restore industry. The stereo-types of Blacks and Asians made them obvious targets for suchrecruitment. The labourers who were recruited typically camefrom economically disadvantaged rural areas. Chain migrationwas common—young migrant workers in Britain encourag-ing friends and family back home to join them, so that a large pro-portion of workers came from specific regions; indeed some villages in Punjab in particular were almost emptied of young,able-bodied males. A third factor was that after the War Britainhad neither the resources, nor the same will, and certainly not theAmerican support, to continue her days of Empire. The doorswere therefore open for migration. Other nations, obviously, wereinvolved, so there were many Polish, Irish, Italian and otherEuropean economic migrants who came to help rebuild Britishindustry.Prior to the 1960s Britain had one of the most liberal immigra-tion regimes, for any citizen of a country in the Empire had anautomatic right to settle in Britain. No entry permits were required.In the late 1950s some politicians questioned this policy and by1962 there were many public expressions of concern at what wasperceived to be the danger of large numbers of immigrants. At thesame time there were no anti-racist policies in place, so that guesthouses and hotels posted notices declaring ‘No Blacks’. BothLabour and Tory governments in the 1960s sought to bring newThe Zoroastrian Trust Funds of Europe316"},{"pageNumber":336,"pageContent":"immigration to an end (spouses of people already settled were anexception). Previously, South Asian migrants had been single maleworkers, coming without their families to earn money to send totheir families ‘back home’. They worked long shifts and lived ascheaply as possible. They rented not simply a room, but even ashare of a bed, used by different shift workers, to save money,thereby reinforcing the widespread image of Asians as living inpoverty and squalor. Once the doors of entry began to close, themen sent for their wives and families, so that they could join thembefore it was too late. People who had envisaged returning to thesubcontinent were provoked to stay, so that the numbers of SouthAsians in the country increased dramatically on the threat of exclu-sion. The nature of the ‘communities’ changed, because the menliving with a view of return now considered themselves settled withtheir families. The wives also ensured that traditional family, reli-gious and social values were followed. So Sikhs grew their beards,community centres opened and soon gave way to temples andmosques. Instead of single men sharing a bed in a rented property,families bought houses. The growth of households, first in inner cityareas, then gradually into the suburbs, alarmed local Whites, whoexpressed concern for their jobs, schools and hospitals.The policies of Arabization in Aden, the revolution inZanzibar, Africanization in East Africa, and above all the brutalexpulsion of Asians from Uganda, resulted in larger numbers ofAsians arriving in Britain from East Africa. Some chose to takeKenyan or Tanzanian passports (see Ch. 6 above), a few went toIndia, but most moved to Britain. The television news reporting ofplaneloads of Asian arrivals provoked more hostility than com-passion, and was a strong factor in the Government’s policy torestrict immigration. Because of the size of the total populationfor a relatively small island, immigration in the second half of thetwentieth century was seen as more of a threat than it was inCanada, the USA or Australia. The fact that Blacks and Asianstended to be concentrated in certain areas (Blacks and Asians inLondon3and Birmingham, Asians in the old textile centres ofThe Zoroastrian Trust Funds of Europe3173Indeed different groups are to be found predominately in different suburbs, Indians inEaling and Brent, Bangladeshis in Tower Hamlets, for example. A new website was openedin 2003 displaying historic documents, old photographs, and some audio recordings ofmigrants coming to Britain from South Asia and the Caribbean, as well as Jews and Irishpeople, for the period 1800–2000 CE.

Whereas in Australia and Canada migrants havebeen seen as an economic advantage for the new country, that hasrarely been emphasized in Britain, even though the ageing andshrinking White population will become disproportionatelydependent on the taxes of the younger (and therefore working)Asian population.There was little difference between Labour and Tory partypolicies on immigration. The Labour Government perhaps gaverather more emphasis than their political opponents to what theypresented as the countermeasure to restricted entry, namely legalequality for those who had settled. So, balancing immigration law,they introduced race relations law. The old notices for accom-modation and employment proclaiming ‘No Blacks’ in theory, ifnot always in practice, gave way to policies promising equality ofopportunity. Indeed, in areas of greater concentration of ‘ethnicminorities’, education and social services were given Special Factor(Section 11) Funding to aid them in policies of settlement.4In anoft-quoted statement, taken to be the epitome of Labour Party pol-icy, the then Junior Home Office Minister, Roy Hattersley, said‘Integration without control is impossible but control without integ-ration is indefensible.’ This policy of ‘balance’ was a feature of the1970s and early 1980s. The restrictions on new entrants haveremained strict, involving what the political Right presented as the‘threat to the purity of this island race’ (given the earlier history ofimmigration to Britain, this is a somewhat questionable concept); itwas voicing a fairly popular perception.

Quietly,successive British governments have been compelled to seekrecruits from overseas for certain areas of employment, notablymedicine, teaching and to some extent the IT industry. The prob-lems of prejudice continue, as witnessed notoriously by theStephen Lawrence case in 1993, when the police were judged tohave been negligent in investigating the racial murder of a Blackyouth. In a subsequent inquiry, the police force as a whole wasfound to be institutionally racist. In 2001, for the first time, therewere Asian riots in the north of England. Racist chants at footballmatches, and the taunts of players, suggest that whateverGovernment may proclaim, the experience of prejudice remainsstrong both in institutional policy and at the grass roots.5However,for those who settle, British citizenship is not simply possible, butexpected.Because the ‘Ethnic’ question had been omitted from census datacollected prior to1991 it was always difficult to estimate the size ofthe various populations. Even with the introduction of the Ethnicquestion in 1991, it was still only possible to indicate how manyoriginated from India, Pakistan, etc., not whether they were Hindu,Sikh or Muslim. Table 7.1 would probably command reasonablywidespread acceptance as a best guess of the figures 1961–91.6There are two further dimensions of the South Asian storymeriting discussion here: 1. The internal characteristics and differ-ences of the Asian community; 2. The changing demographics ofthe Asian groups. It should be noted that in Britain, ‘Asian’ almostalways means South Asian. Chinese from Hong Kong apart, thereare few migrants from East or South East Asia, unlike in otherwestern countries studied. The British Asian population has grownpredominantly from the old Empire, or the New Commonwealth.The Zoroastrian Trust Funds of Europe3195In a Home Office-funded project in 1999–2000, the University of Derby found thatthe majority of institutions involved with ‘visible minorities’ believed that they faced reli-gious discrimination. Among Christians who responded it was mostly the Black (led)churches which believed that they faced such discrimination. See P. Weller, A. Feldman andK. Purdam,Religious Discrimination in England and Wales, London, 2001.

Studies of the British communities in the 1990s demon-strated that the second generation was substantially different fromtheir parents who migrated. Because of the value traditionallyattached to education in South Asia, a very high proportion ofsecond-generation South Asians pursued higher education, espe-cially in the fields of medicine, law and accountancy. The EastAfrican Asians had the highest percentage, followed by the Indians,the Pakistanis and finally the Bangladeshis (as a group who arrivedlater, it may be that their figures will become closer to the othergroups within the next few years). A higher proportion of SouthAsians go to university than do the young of the White majoritypopulation.7Although there is some evidence that the South Asiansdo not obtain employment appropriate for their education, never-theless, they are moving up the income and professional ladders incomparison with the earlier settlers.

Pakistanis and Bangladeshis are more likely to live asextended families than East African Asians or Indians. It is essen-tial not to view the British South Asian presence as a monolithicand unchanging phenomenon.The study of South Asian religion in BritainThe only way to estimate the number of followers of the variousreligions in Britain is to assume that a certain percentage of eachethnic group follow a specific religion, e.g. that nearly all Pakistanisare Muslims. This is obviously simplistic, especially when appliedto people from India. Different commentators have producedsignificantly different figures, and the following indicates the sort ofrange of numbers suggested by wise and experienced scholars inthe field: Muslims 750,000–1,200,000; Hindus 300,000–500,000;Sikhs 300,000–450,000; There are thought to be approximately20,000 Jains.8There have been many fine studies of South Asiancommunities in Britain, but until the mid- to late-1980s these werealmost all of a sociological or political nature; the religions of thesecommunities were commonly ignored. In part this may be a critic-ism of the sociologists and political historians for focusing on theone dimension of the group they studied and prioritizing their ownconcerns, commonly humanist. It is also a failure of people inReligious Studies to take these communities seriously. The prevail-ing assumption was that ‘real’ Hinduism, Islam, Sikhism, etc. wasthe religion of the old country, and commonly the ancient religion.Religious Studies in Britain in those years usually neglected themodern forms of the religions, especially the diaspora groups. Tosome extent both groups of scholars were reflecting what were, andremain, two fairly common assumptions in Britain: first, thatBritain is a secular state where religion does not have great signific-ance; second, that where religion is to be found it is a private mat-ter, a question of personal faith and morals. This presumption lies,for example, behind various government initiatives, and especiallynon-initiatives, such as the refusal to consider applications for fund-ing from religious groups, but accepting those from social bodiesand centres. It has also been used as a justification for not takingreligious issues into account in policies—witness the existence oflegislation against racial but not against religious discrimination.The Zoroastrian Trust Funds of Europe3218See Hinnells, ‘South Asians in Britain’, p. 86 for a brief discussion of the numbers."},{"pageNumber":341,"pageContent":"What the various groups of scholars and politicians ignored wasthe fact that within these groups of South Asians, religion was oftena matter of importance. As we shall see, for groups like theZoroastrians, religion is of considerable community importance,for many South Asians do not see religion as one aspect of life, assimply a question of personal belief, but rather as a crucial markerof group or individual identity.The causes and course of the change in scholarly attitudes wouldmake an interesting study in itself. Here it is possible to give only abrief overview, but I write as one who was guilty of the narrow-mindedness of Religious Studies in Britain prior to the 1980s. Inmy opinion, a significant factor for change was the establishmentof the Centre for Community Religions started by ProfessorMichael Pye at the University of Leeds. The first researcher toundertake substantial work in this area was Kim Knott, then aresearch student, now Professor, at Leeds, with her work on Hindusin Leeds.9The Leeds project has continued to generate suchstudies,10as have various people associated with the School ofOriental and African Studies (SOAS) in London.11Other notablestudies include those of Nesbitt and Jackson,12and Nye.13Thebroad themes that they address were indicated in Chapter 1 above.Western social structures inevitably impact on forms of institution-alization (for example, conformity with the law to obtain taxexemption can require new committee structures and involve dif-ferent styles of leadership). External perceptions of a religion canaffect not only the public presentation but even internal emphases,for example the prioritizing of a sacred ‘scripture’, or the classi-fication of someone as, say, Hindu rather than as a devotee ofKrishna or Rama, or of a particular holy man like Sai Baba.The Zoroastrian Trust Funds of Europe3229See esp.Hinduism in Leeds, Leeds, 1986 and My Sweet Lord: The Hare Krishna Movement,Wellingborough, 1986.10Notably, but not only, D.

It is therefore difficult to give any idea of the number ofZoroastrians then in Britain. The address lists at ZoroastrianHouse had about 600 addresses, and it was not uncommon to sug-gest a total of 2,000 Zoroastrians in the country. Since there havebeen few new migrants, and at the beginning of the millenniummost estimates of Zoroastrians numbers approach 6–7,000, itseems likely there were more Zoroastrians in the country at anearlier date than was realized, but they were not then linked withthe Association. From my survey conducted in the mid-1980s, thefollowing demographic profile of the known community can bereconstructed (see Appendix 2, Table 1: 1–37). The majority (over50%) of British Zoroastrians were born in Bombay, with a further10% from the rest of India. The next largest group were the EastAfrican Parsis; this is a distinctive feature of the British commun-ity, for they are a much smaller group in Canada, and there werefew in Australia or the USA. The other main country of birth wasPakistan. There are thought to be fewer Iranian Zoroastrians,under 10% of the Zoroastrian population. One in five of myrespondents arrived in Britain prior to the 1960s, two-thirdsarrived in the 1960s or 1970s, and few came thereafter. It wasbroadly a younger population than that in the old country, but hada higher proportion of elders than found in any other westerncountry. It had also a higher proportion of under-25s thanAmerica and Canada, a consequence of there being a longerestablished community. There were more single people amongBritish Zoroastrians than elsewhere in the diaspora, and therewere more second- and third-generation Zoroastrians. The figuresfor intermarriage are complex. In all western countries the pro-portion of intermarried Zoroastrians is higher in the scatteredgroups than in the centres, so for example 24% of Zoroastriansoutside London were intermarried, compared with 16% inLondon; these figures were on the high side both for scatteredgroups and for centres.In comparison with the wider British public, even in comparisonwith other South Asians in Britain, British Zoroastrians had a highproportion of people with degrees and postgraduate qualifications,The Zoroastrian Trust Funds of Europe323"},{"pageNumber":343,"pageContent":"but the Zoroastrians in America had yet higher qualifications.

In broadterms, the Parsi response to British rule in India was very positive.This is hardly surprising in view of the fact that, although a tinyminority, they were able to flourish in British India, whereas underMuslim rule in their Iranian homeland they had been oppressed.But there were critics of British rule, some of them very powerfulverbal attacks, as we shall see when discussing Saklatvalla.The first Zoroastrian, probably the first Indian, to visit Britainwas Naoroji Rustomji Maneck (Seth) in 1724.14His family hadenabled the earliest British traders to develop their business inBombay and Gujarat, his father Rustom Maneck Seth serving astheir broker first in Surat then in Bombay. He even negotiated forthem with the Mogul Emperor Aurangzeb. However, a laterGovernor of Bombay, Philips, accused the family of dishonesty andsupported their Hindu rival, Vitaldas Parak; he put Rustom’s sonsunder house arrest. Various senior British officials who knew thefamily appealed on their behalf, including the commander of thenaval squadron in the Indian Ocean, Commodore Mathews, andthe Muslim Governor of Surat, but to no avail.

Hestayed for a year while his appeal was being heard and developedgood trading contacts. The Court found in his favour, ordering therelease of the still imprisoned brother and the return of all moniesdue, with interest. A substantial sum was paid in London (£19,125)which enabled him to load a ship with goods to take back, the restbeing paid in rupees. The previous Governor and family friend,Charles Boone, now back in London, supported Naoroji and on thehappy outcome of the appeal wrote to the family:Since Nowrojee’s coming to England he hath been very ill, but he hastaken great pains in this business, and everybody here hath great valueand esteem for him because he has managed this affair to the satisfactionof the Hon’ble Company, and for the good and interest of his brothersand family, therefore you ought to make him a handsome present for hislong and fatiguing voyage and good services.On his return Naoroji was fêted. An area in central Bombay wasnamed Naoroji Hill after him, and the income from this landensured the family fortune for two centuries. He was elected aleader of the first Bombay Parsi Punchayet. In his will hebequeathed money to build the Maneckji Seth Agiary in central(Fort) Bombay. It can be reasonably assumed that among theParsis, and others, this gave an impression of the British authoritiesas a power that would listen to a plea, and overrule local authoritiesif they were convinced of the justice of the case. Equally, one mayassume it gave an impression of benefit to be derived from visitingBritain.There were three main groups of Parsis who travelled to Britainin the nineteenth century: businessmen going for trade or to learnabout their trade; students; and travellers on a grand tour. Eachgroup has importance. From 1840 several leading Parsi industrial-ists travelled to Britain to learn from the technological develop-ments there. The first was Ardeshir K. Wadia, who travelledunder the auspices of the East India Company to study develop-ments in marine engineering. He had long prided himself onbeing at the forefront of technology, having introduced gas light-ing to Bombay in 1835. He was a member of the famous ship-building family and wanted to develop that industry further inBombay. As a result of his stay he was appointed Chief EngineerThe Zoroastrian Trust Funds of Europe325"},{"pageNumber":345,"pageContent":"and Inspector of Machinery in Bombay, an appointment which isknown to have excited jealousy from some British residents. He wasamong the founding trustees of what became the Zoroastrian TrustFunds of Europe (ZTFE) in 1861 and was buried in the Zoroastriancemetery, Brookwood. In 1841, two of his cousins, Naoroji andHirjibhoy Meherwanji, came for similar reasons. They producedsome fascinating diary accounts of their stay, which will be dis-cussed below. R. B. Desai came in 1857 to study the soap industryand returned to build a factory; R. M. Darukhanawala studied themanufacture of explosives before returning to Bombay as head of the explosives department of the government artillery depot;A. C. Wadia came in 1859 to purchase boiler machinery and in1860 Ookerji came to buy a steamer.15J. N. Tata made the first ofa series of visits to study the Lancashire textile industry in 1865,before starting his Nagpur Empress Mills.16The first Indian firmto be set up in Britain was a Parsi one. In 1855 Dadabhai Naoroji,the future religious reformer K. R. Cama, and his Orthodoxcousin M. H. Cama, set up offices in London and Liverpool. Theydealt with a range of goods in the import and export trade—thread, opium, wine and spirits. Naoroji and K. R. Cama resignedbecause they disapproved of opium and alcohol. The businessfolded, but M. H. Cama stayed on, and Naoroji funded his earlypolitical campaign from the profits of his own import–exporttrade. So the initial venture led on to more successful businesses.More Parsis came as formal students from the 1860s, almost allto do postgraduate work following the establishment of BombayUniversity in 1857. The most popular subjects and destinationswere Manchester for technology, Edinburgh for Medicine, andLondon for Law and Medicine. The first medical graduate,Muncherjee B. Kolah, gained his MD from St Andrews and hisFRCS from London in 1861.17Several future Parsi leaders pur-sued their studies in London. Pherozeshah Mehta, often referredto as the ‘uncrowned king of Bombay’, who was hugely influentialin the politics of western India and the early years of theIndian National Congress, studied in London in 1868.

He became a leadingsocial reformer in India. Later came one of the other leading socialreformers, Malabari.18Most of these businessmen and studentscame as single males with the assumption of an early return totheir families in India. But when Naoroji brought his family over tosettle in 1865, others came also. These were the early stages of theformation of a Zoroastrian community in Britain, some hundredyears before other South Asian families began to settle there.Travellers on the grand tour are not usually important in thegrowth of a Zoroastrian community, but their visits are of interestfor various reasons. It is noteworthy how early Parsi women trav-elled with their husbands. The first such touring family was that ofDr B. Cooper in 1858. In 1862 two of C. M. Shroff ’s daughterscame as part of their father’s ardent campaign for educatingwomen. In 1868 one of K. R. Cama’s daughters, Bhikhaiji, thewife of a London Parsi resident, D. P. Cama, travelled throughoutBritain. J. H. Kothari undertook a grand world tour with his fam-ily, visiting Britain in 1883–4, before travelling throughoutEurope, America, China and Japan. The first Indian woman tostudy at Oxford was a Parsi, Cornelia Sorabji, in 1889. The ‘com-ing out’ of Parsi woman took place much earlier than it did inother Indian communities.One tour merits particular attention, partly for humorousreasons, but also because it indicates an important feature of Anglo-Parsi relations, and that is the visit of the first Indian cricket teamto tour England.19The first Parsi cricket club, the Oriental CricketClub, was formed in 1848 and renamed the Zoroastrian CricketClub in 1850. Other Parsi and Indian cricket clubs soon followedin Bombay. The intercommunal matches could be tense affairs;those between the Parsis and the Muslims sometimes had to becancelled for this reason. All of the Indian cricket teams wereeager to defeat the Europeans. Discussions started in 1878 onsending a team to England to learn about the game. The toureventually took place in 1886. The results were disappointing(played 28, won 1, lost 19, drew 8). The motive for learning thegame, however, was what was seen as important. The president of the club, Pherozeshah Mehta, in proposing the toast to theThe Zoroastrian Trust Funds of Europe32718See Burton,At the Heart of Empire, pp. 152–87.19Zoroastrians in Britain, pp. 85–7."},{"pageNumber":347,"pageContent":"departing team, said:I must say that the object of the team in going to England is a verymodest one.

Ithas taken root among the Parsi community, and as artists go to Italy todo homage to the great masters, as pilgrims go to Jerusalem to worshipat a shrine, or as students in the Middle Ages went to the chief seats oflearning in places where Science and Philosophy had made their home,so now the Parsis are going to England to do homage to the Englishcricketers, to learn something of their noble and manly pastime in thevery country which is its chosen home.20The English perception of the tour is reflected in the comments ofthe magazine Cricket ChitChatof 1887.A visit of a team of native Cricketers (Parsis) to England is an event ofno small significance, not only from the standpoint of cricket, but alsofrom the political point of view. Anything which can tend to promote anassimilation of tastes and habits between the English and native subjectsof our Empress Queen cannot fail to conduce to the solidity of theBritish Empire, and if only for that reason this latest development ofcricket, the zeal with which the natives of India are working to secureproficiency in the chief and the best of our sports, cannot be overestim-ated. The Parsi fraternity is the most intelligent, as well as the most loyalof the races scattered over our Indian possessions.21There are two important themes in these quotations. The first is theperception of the ‘Britishness’ of cricket; the second is the Parsiengagement with cricket with the reference to the assimilation oftastes and habits being conducive to the solidity of the Empire, andMehta’s reference to the noble and manly pastime. Parsi love ofcricket is reflected in the cartoons of the Parsi-run Hindi Punchin thenineteenth century, and in the fact that two Parsi histories of crickethad been written by 1900. Prominent figures of Indian British soci-ety were aware of this love. An English judge in the Indian CivilService, C. A. Kincaid, for example, wrote an article arguing thatthe only explanation for the Parsi aptitude for cricket, and thepreservation of their identity in India, must be that they, like theBritish, had derived their qualities from the Greeks, somethingwhich for the Zoroastrians he dates back to the time of Alexander’sinvasion of Persia. He does not explain how either the British, orThe Zoroastrian Trust Funds of Europe32820H. D. Darukhanawala,Parsis and Sports, Bombay, 1935, pp. 61 f. and PPIII. 183.21M. K.

The article was reproduced in fullin the magazine The Parsi, where the only comment of the editorwas that he would date the Greek influence back to earlier times.22There was, therefore, more significance attached to this cricket tourthan simply being a good holiday. It was seen as reflecting a sharedvalue system between the Parsis and the British.Travellers’ talesSeveral of these travellers wrote fascinating journals, diaries andimpressions of what they saw. These are interesting for their ownsake, contain first-hand accounts of how Parsis from India sawBritain, and may be assumed to have influenced their friends backin India with their picture of life in Britain.23One of the dominant impressions made on the travellersappears to have been the busy-ness and the bustle of London life.From the immense number of people, and vehicles of every description,that we saw hurrying along apparently in great haste, and from theincreasing noise, we were apprehensive that some public commotionhad taken place...Every street down which we looked, appeared to bepouring out countless multitudes to swell the throng...But we wereafterwards informed that this constant tide of human beings was to bewitnessed every day for twelve or fourteen hours.24Well may they call it [London] great and busy. The continual and mostextraordinary bustle and traffic is quite sufficient to bewilder the ordin-ary stranger; on the footwalks the business people seem to rush along as if for a race; carts, drays, omnibuses and crowds of other vehicles,completely fill the street. It is there that you see that time is money.25The Zoroastrian Trust Funds of Europe32922The original article appeared in East and West, Feb. 1905 and was reproduced in TheParsi, Mar. 1905.23Because they were written in English they would have been read only by the educatedmiddle classes in Bombay, but they are precisely the sort of people who were likely to con-sider undertaking such travels themselves. One that I have not included in this book, or inZoroastrians in Britain, is Cornelia Sorabji, the first Indian woman to study law at Oxford.Her father (but not her mother) was born a Parsi but he converted to Christianity and wasordained. She herself was a Christian. That, and the fact that as far as I can discern shehad little impact on the Parsi community, is why I have omitted her. However, she diddescribe herself as of Parsi nationality and I have sometimes wondered if I was wrong toexclude her. See the account in Burton,At the Heart of the Empire, pp. 110–51.24J. N. and H. M.

Why byknowledge or science put into practice, because knowledge is power;and it is by power of knowledge alone, and not by power of arms, thatshe has so many means of attracting the world to her, and extending thespread of her empire.

(p. 24)Most of these early travellers were impressed by pageantry,especially by royalty, and all of them went to see, or be seen by,them. The Wadia brothers again supply most details. One daythey took up a position where the Queen was known to walk. Shenoticed their traditional dress and sent a messenger asking fortheir names and which country they were from. On receivingtheir card she ‘did us the honour upon reaching the end of the ter-race again to look upon us, and what to her was the novelty, ourcostume’.

Modi relates a similar experiencewhen K. R. Cama and Dosabhai Framji visited Balmoral. TheQueen noticed them in the crowd and invited them to tour thecastle and they were provided with lunch, although they did notmeet the Queen. Cama spoke of her khoreh, her (royal) glory.27But the travellers were not uncritical of England. Wadia in 1840and Malabari in 1893 were forcibly struck by the dirt and povertyof London, and expressed their gratitude that India was not asbad: ‘The scene was to me very extraordinary. I had never beforewitnessed so dense a fog, and the streets and shops were lightedwith gas, although it was noon day...Another nuisance ofLondon is the dirty state of the road compared with Bombay.’28Malabari was struck by the extremes of wealth and poverty:Poor as India is, I thank God she knows not much of the poverty towhich parts of Great Britain have been accustomed—the East end ofLondon, for instance, parts of Glasgow, and other congested centres oflife. Men and women living in a chronic state of emaciation, till they canhardly be recognised as human; picking up as food, what even animalswill turn away from; sleeping fifty, sixty, eighty of them together of allages and both sexes, in a hole that could not hold ten with decency;swearing, fighting, trampling on one another; filling the room with foulconfusion and fouler air. This is not a picture of occasional misery; insome places it represents the every-day life of the victims of misfortune.29Some of the travellers also commented on the racial prejudicethey encountered, especially from two parts of society: ‘We wouldinform our countrymen that the majority of the lower orders inEngland are very rude in their manners and behaviour towardsstrangers, whom they do not like to see in their country.’30‘The drivers of the cabs and other public vehicles, are an insolentand imposing set of men, who take every advantage, especially offoreigners.’31Naoroji Ferdoonji, in a paper delivered in London in1874, attacked ‘the ignorance that prevails in this country regard-ing the condition of India’.32He was of the opinion that inThe Zoroastrian Trust Funds of Europe33127J.

They are fre-quently stigmatised as niggers, a nation of liars, perjurers, forgers, devoidof gratitude, trust and good nature...On many occasions the subjectrace is treated as if they were rude barbarians and inhuman savages...A considerable number of European officers and others belonging to thedominant race are often so reckless in their demeanour in the interior ofthe country that they have no hesitation in shooting, killing, assaultingand ill treating the Natives, and committing gross outrages.He went on to complain that Europeans who were violent to, oreven killed, Indians were not punished, and Indians were forced tolive under a different set of legal rights. He concluded that therewas different treatment in Britain from that experienced in India,and that the right class of Englishman was not being sent out: anEnglishman sent to India ‘considered himself a superior beingbelonging to the ruling class, moves in his own proud and limitedcircle, assumes high airs, lords over the natives of India, whom hetreats as an inferior and abject race.’33In addition to the perception of British racism, there wereaspects of British social life which did not appeal to the travellers.The Wadia brothers could not understand the English love of gar-dening and why ‘gentlemen should dig the ground with their ownhands, and in fact go through all the duties of a gardener merelyto pass away their time’.34They could not understand why peopleliked ballet. After watching a famous dancer (Taglioni) they couldnot see why she was paid so highly ‘to stand for a long time like agoose upon one leg...Had we not seen instances that convincedus the English were clever people, we would have thought themvery foolish indeed thus to pay a dancing puppet’ (pp. 102 f.).They were critical of the British press for being so inflammatory.Malabari deplored British family morals, commenting that mar-riage was going out of fashion and that British friendship was asfickle as the weather and not reliable, unlike Asiatic friendship.35The Zoroastrian Trust Funds of Europe33233Ferdunji,Personal Bearing, pp. 4 f., 18.34Wadias,Journal,p.88.35Indian Eye, pp. 66 f. and 119 f."},{"pageNumber":352,"pageContent":"The Wadias were highly critical of the mutual attacks of theChristian sects: ‘Oh, we thought, would that religion in Englandwas not taken up as a trade! Would that charity and brotherly lovewere preached and acted upon, instead of finding faults with theirfellow brethren, and exciting each other to bitter religioushatred’.36Malabari, also, found the Anglican Church lacking ininspiration for him: ‘There seems to be a good deal of drawl in thereading, and a good deal of vocal gymnastics’ (p. 97).Perhaps the most amusing passages of these travellers’ accountsare those of the Wadia brothers about Parliament. They tried toexplain to their readers the composition of the House of Lords.After referring to the great landowners and the bishops, they went on:After sometime admirals of the navy and commanders of the armywere made noblemen and sent to the House of Peers, sometimes per-sons have been made noblemen for lending their lives to the King,sometimes if a person has been very troublesome in the House ofCommons and has been constantly asking for information not pleasantfor the Government to give, he has been made a nobleman; if a minis-ter wanted votes upon a particular measure which he was anxious tocarry, a peerage has been conferred upon a person to abstain from vot-ing on the question; and if a man who held a place in a ministry wasfound to be of no use, and would not resign his situation, he was madea nobleman and sent to the House of Peers.They commented on the length of speeches, even when the vot-ing outcome was known, thus wasting much time. But it was theHouse of Commons which impressed them least:and yet upon the whole we were disappointed. We had expected to haveseen the representatives of all the wealth, all the talent, all the resourcesof the country, better dressed and a different looking set of men.

Authors who name the Parsis ascraven in their attitude to the British have not always read theirsources thoroughly!Zoroastrian literature for the BritishSeveral Parsi authors writing between 1858 and 1938 producedbooks and papers on their religion intended for consumption bythe British. Being who they were, these writers can be seen toreflect a broad trend of Parsi attitudes. They were: Framjee (1858),who later wrote under the name Karaka (1884), Dadabhai Naoroji(1862 and 1908), Kapadia (1905), A. S. N. Wadia (1912) andMasani (1938).37Most of these writers were prominent figures; allhad a high level of western education. Karaka was a politician. Hewas the first Indian chairman of the Bombay Municipality, amember of the Bombay Legislative Council and a founder mem-ber of the Bombay Presidency Association, though he resignedfrom the last after one year, fearing that its work might alienate theBritish. His strongly pro-British stand is reflected in the fact that hissecond work was dedicated to the Prince of Wales and ends withthe words, ‘God Bless the Queen.’ His aim was clearly to write abook that would commend his people to the rulers. But behind thismotive lay knowledge of his community’s history. DadabhaiNaoroji was also a prominent politician. Again, his motive was tocommend Zoroastrianism to the British, but rather than emphas-ize Parsi achievements as Karaka did, he stressed how at its heartZoroastrianism was like Protestant Christianity, apart from the factthat superstitious ignorant priests had defiled the pure teaching ofthe Prophet. His work is characterized as much by his religiousreforming zeal as by his political motives. Sir Rustom Masani ismore difficult to characterize. He worked as the editor of a news-paper (Indian Spectator, which was devoted to conveying Indianviews to British politicians), he held senior posts in the bankingworld, was the first Indian to be Municipal Commissioner andThe Zoroastrian Trust Funds of Europe33437D.

Heexpounded an abstract, rational religion of ‘good thoughts, wordsand deeds’, where evil is not a separate force but is the strugglewithin a person, ‘a ceaseless conflict between the animal and thehuman, the diabolic and the divine’. As far as devotion before thefire was concerned, he wrote: ‘What indeed, can be a more natu-ral and more sublime representation of Him who is HimselfEternal Light, than a pure, undefiled flame?’38Whereas Karaka sought to paint a glowing picture of the Parsicommunity in the round, Kapadia’s smaller book is focused on reli-gion. Kapadia was a lecturer at University College, London and alawyer. He was active in the Zoroastrian Trust Funds and was jointeditor of the ‘Wisdom of the East’ series published by John Murrayin London. He was essentially a London-based intellectual.Ardeshir S. Wadia, in contrast, was Bombay based, a Professor ofEnglish and History at Bombay’s prestigious Elphinstone College.He also wrote on Indian social affairs and may be classed as polit-ically right wing; he argued, for example, that education should notbe available to everyone, because some could not benefit from it andpeople were needed for menial tasks. He vigorously opposedNaoroji’s calls for Independence. His book aimed to show theBritish how like their form of Christianity Parsi religion was. Eachof the authors, therefore, has a strong communal agenda.Inevitably, in view of their education and motives, each of theauthors made substantial use of western academics and writers.39The one exception is Naoroji, which is very surprising, because inhis political speeches he commonly stacked up enormous numbersof quotations of western writers who shared his views. The reasonfor this omission appears to be that Naoroji had little knowledge ofwestern scholarship on Zoroastrianism.All of the writers, without exception, emphasize monotheism.Framjee was writing only fifteen years after Wilson’s attack onBombay Parsis, and much of his emphasis is intended to counterWilson-type criticisms; for example, he argues that Ahrimanshould be understood simply in an allegorical sense. The allegor-ical interpretation of myth and ritual (notably in seeing the purityThe Zoroastrian Trust Funds of Europe33538Religion of the Good Life, pp. 11 and 80 respectively.39The following summary points are justified in more detail in Zoroastrians in Britain,pp. 97–102."},{"pageNumber":355,"pageContent":"laws in terms of modern hygiene) is retained through all writersdown to Masani. All the writers refute the Muslim label ofZoroastrians as fire worshippers. Equally, all of them emphasizenot simply a similarity to Christianity, but specifically to British val-ues, notably royalty and common ethical mores. A western writerwhom these authors, like many Parsis, made use of was SamuelLaing, one time Minister of Finance for India, who wrote severalbooks on science and religion. In the one on Zoroastrianism hestressed that Zoroastrian teaching on good and evil was consistentwith the laws of polarity, the positive and the negative forces ofelectricity, uncovered by modern science. He also emphasized thesweet reasonableness of Zoroastrian teaching and made a lengthyquotation of a passage from Andrew Carnegie on the inspiringnature of Parsi prayers before the ocean and the setting sun.40Thegoal was to show that the nature of Zoroastrianism marked it asdifferent from all other religions in India, and it was in full accordwith the highest ideals of Christian Britain.Parsis, both in India and Britain, were convinced not only thattheir religion and communal ideals were in accord with those ofthe rulers, but also that this was recognized by the British. To thisend they could, and did, point to the number of honours bestowedon their members. Foremost were the baronetcies (above all Sir Jamsetji Jijibhoy), and the sixty-three knighthoods.41A Parsi,Shirinbai M. Cursetjee, was the first Indian to be presented atCourt, in 1865, and the columns of the Parsi Prakashdetail eightmore such presentations in the nineteenth century.42They werealso proud of their elections to learned and socially exclusive soci-eties. For example, Cursetji Maneckji Shroff, though he had beenturned down for membership of the Royal Asiatic Society in Indiabecause he was a native, was elected in London in 1835. Six yearslater he was refused admission to the Masonic Lodge in India, forthe same reason, but he was admitted in Europe in 1842, whereonhe returned to India and started a lodge for ‘natives’. The columnsof the Parsi Prakashalso catalogue nineteen instances of Parsi bio-graphies and articles on distinguished Parsis in such socially presti-gious publications as the Illustrated London News,Vanity Fair, the GraphicThe Zoroastrian Trust Funds of Europe33640S.

The first of these, on Cursetji R.

These donations wererecorded not only in the columns of the Parsi Prakash, but also inspecially produced Parsi War Memorial Volumes.43Some Parsis unquestionably went to extremes in their pro-British stance. An example is the author of the ladies’ column inthe Bombay magazine,The Parsi. She saw the establishment of aParsi community in London as a glorious idea to aspire to:The closer union of the Europeans and Parsis is the finest thing that canhappen to our race. It will mean the lifting upof a people who are lyinglow, though possessing all the qualities of a European race. It will makeour men more of ‘men’ than they are at present and will make ourwomen better women. The complete Europeanization of the Parsis isnow a mere matter of time...Imagine 100 well-to-do Parsi families set-tled down in England and bringing up their children in English schoolsand colleges! What a glorious day that would be for the race!44Although she represents a strand of Parsi thought and attitude, andalthough Parsis on the whole were generally pro-British andbelieved that there was much in common in the values of the tworaces, nevertheless, most Parsis took a more balanced perspectiveand were not wholly uncritical of the British and life in Britain.Alongside the writer in the ladies’ column ofThe Parsi, it is alsoimportant to note that Parsis were active in the inception and theearly years of the Indian National Congress: it was a Parsi who firstcalled for Independence (Naoroji) and a Parsi who first unfurled theIndian flag (Madame Cama). As we saw in Chapter 2, Parsis wereassociated with Gandhi, and one of the harshest critics of Britain,Saklatvalla, was a Parsi (see below). But between the extremes ofThe Parsiand Saklatvalla, most Parsis who travelled to England didso in the conviction that they shared important values and ideals,and that they were respected by the British.

It reads:To Zoroastrians of EnglandSirs,Our people go to several countries for business. There each persongives according to his means for religious (charitable) purposes and thusperforms meritorious deeds. This enables them not only to performgood deeds but also enables them to live in harmony with one anotherand be with one another in good times and bad.Currently by the grace of God we are about 50—including students(who come here for higher studies)47and our number is likely to increaseyear by year. For this reason it is essential to consider this matter urgently.The Zoroastrian Trust Funds of Europe33845The Association underwent a series of name changes. When it was first formed on31 Oct. 1861 it was called ‘Religious Funds of the Zarathushtrians of Europe’. On 25 Sep.1889 it became ‘The Charitable Fund of the Zoroastrians of Europe’. On 14 Aug. 1909 itbecame ‘The Incorporated Parsee Association of Europe’. On 8 Aug. 1971 the name waschanged to ‘The Zoroastrian Association of Europe’, and its present name ‘ZoroastrianTrust Funds of Europe (Incorporated)’ became the name from 1 Feb. 1979. The last ofthese, abbreviated to ZTFE, is the one that will be commonly used in what follows.Technically that is incorrect when writing about the years before 1979, but the use of avariety of names may have been confusing. The changes reflect modifications to the con-stitution, and Parsee was changed to Zoroastrian in 1971 to take account of the presenceof Iranian Zoroastrians. These names do not indicate separate or rival bodies.46More detailed accounts, with full references, to the matters discussed in this sectionare to be found in Zoroastrians in Britain, ch. 4.47It is worth noting that this reference to students coming for higher studies indicatesthat this trend pre-dates the dates given above, which were based on the columns of theParsi Prakash."},{"pageNumber":358,"pageContent":"If you think my idea is good, we can arrange to meet at some place,listen to each other’s views and reach a satisfactory conclusion.48Cama chaired the meeting at his home on 22 September 1861,which was attended by fifteen people,49and a draft constitution wasmailed to (unnamed) Zoroastrians known to reside in Manchesterand Liverpool. A redrafting committee, involving Naoroji, wasformed. In a document submitted to a meeting on 6 October it wasemphasized that this Association was a European one, not justfor Britain. The document states: ‘It was decided that the chiefadministrative office of the Fund at present will be in England butif at some later stage the Zarthoshti population in any other city ismore than that in England the administrative office should beshifted to such a city.’50Funds that were raised, it stated, ‘should beutilised to build houses in every such city of the European continentwhere the number of Zarthostis is on the increase’. At a sub-sequent meeting (13 November) Cama was elected chairman andNaoroji a trustee of the Funds established through collecteddonations. The third trustee, and the senior one, was Ardeshir K.Wadia. Six funds were established; their purpose indicates theperceived priorities of the founders. They were: to bury the dead;to help destitute Zoroastrians in Europe to return to India; to pur-chase books about Zoroastrianism; to help ‘scholars dealing withresearch in Zoroastrianism [and] to help intelligent and suitableZoroastrians for research work in Zoroastrianism’; to establish a ‘House of Prayer’; and finally to organize a general fund formiscellaneous expenditure.51The prioritizing of charity for thepoor and the support for scholarship are characteristic ofZoroastrian communities.

The first thirty to forty years of the Trusts’ his-tory were beset by financial problems because several merchantswere suffering from the collapse of the Bombay stock market,following the economic crash in what is widely referred to as ‘theshare mania’, when many Parsis lost their fortunes. As a resultfewer Parsis than anticipated came to London, and so membershipnumbers dropped. Meetings had to be cancelled because they werenot quorate and rules had to be changed to allow individuals tohold more than one office as there were not enough volunteers.There is no suggestion of any nineteenth-century social functions;essentially the Trusts appear to have been functioning as an ethnicburial club, comparable to those for specific groups in wider Britishsociety.The incorporationThe history of the Trusts changed from 1908. Naoroji retired andreturned to India because of ill health. Bhownaggree was electedchairman in his place. Under his chairmanship the Trusts weretransformed in three ways: 1.

The first recorded prob-lem of the presence of non-Zoroastrians was raised at the AGM on14 September 1891 and concerned the non-Zoroastrians at thefuneral of Mrs D. P. Cama. At the AGM the following year it wasagreed that they would be allowed to be present at funerals. In1910, J. R. D. Tata, then in Paris, wrote to ask about the rights ofpeople who were not Zoroastrian by birth, but had married aZoroastrian and believed in the religion. He asked if they couldbecome members of the Association, able to participate in thereligion and be buried in the Zoroastrian cemetery at Brookwood(see below). The letter was raising the question of the marriagewhich had provoked the 1906 law case (see Chapter 2). TheAssociation consulted Naoroji (then retired to India), as the onlysurviving original trustee, asking what the original intention hadbeen.53In 1923 the problem emerged of the non-Zoroastrianspouse of a member wanting to be buried at Brookwood. On theadvice of the then secretary to the BPP, Sir J. J. Modi, it was ruledshe could not be interred there. The question was raised withregard to the wife, and specifically with the children, ofSaklatvalla. The practice advised by Modi was to allow the naujoteof the children of a Parsi male, but not of the non-Zoroastrianspouse. These problems indicate at an early date the difficulty ofdefining the boundaries of the community, the observance of thepurity laws and the locus of religious authority for practices in thediaspora, which as far as the European Association was concernedwas Bombay and the specifically the BPP.54From 1908 the records started referring to social functions in theAssociation. At Pateti that year ‘a large number, about 60 ladiesand gentlemen spent the afternoon on the river in a specially char-tered steamer followed by a dinner’ (AGM minutes). On anotheroccasion a banquet was held at the Criterion restaurant to whichthe Rt. Hon. Lord Ampthill and Harold Cox MP ‘were invited asthe guests of the Community in appreciation of the valuable serv-ices they had rendered to our, among other, Communities of Indiain advocating their rights and better treatment in South Africa.’The political interests of Bhownaggree are evident in this becauseThe Zoroastrian Trust Funds of Europe34153Letter from R.

But at subsequent func-tions a Maharaja, a Muslim leader, Field Marshal the Earl Haig,and the Oxford academic, L. H. Mills, attended. Other venues usedincluded the Ritz, the National Liberal Club and Caxton Hall. Theaim was presumably to project the image of the Parsi communityas a sophisticated, loyal and splendid body. The standing of thecommunity was assisted by the appointment of a Parsi, Sir DadibaDalal, as the first Indian to become Indian High Commissioner inLondon in 1923. This image was enhanced by Sir DhunjibhoyBomanjee, who purchased from the Duchess of Sutherland theWindsor estate, said to be one of the most expensive homes in thecountry, with grounds so extensive that they included a racecourse.He made a fortune as supplier to the army in the Boer and FirstWorld Wars, and was knighted for his extensive charity, targetedparticularly towards war victims. The Association also made use ofRatan Tata’s mansion, York House, at Twickenham, a propertylarge enough to be used as a town hall a few years later. The sociallife, and the social standing, of Parsis in London changed signific-antly in the first decades of the twentieth century, especially with thefirst three Asian MPs at Westminster: Naoroji (1892–5),Bhownaggree (1895–1906) and Saklatvalla (1922–3, 1924–9). Allthree are discussed below.The Parsi Social UnionThe provision of a social life for a small community composed ofdifferent age groups, and people from varied backgrounds, isextremely difficult. There are indications that Bhownaggree’s devel-opment of a high social life provoked difficulties elsewhere. Thatappears to be at least part of the explanation for the establishmentof ‘the Parsi Social Union’. The first Annual Report (1906/7)explains some of the tensions involved. The Union was started:by a small body of Parsis who were actuated by the desire to promote abetter social intercourse among members of the community. The idea didnot find favour in certain quarters, from which hostile manoeuvres wereset on foot to nip in the bud this excellent and much desired idea of a Clubin a country where club life is an essential thing. Thanks to the sagacityand broadmindedness of your committee it took very prompt measures todisarm the opposition. An informal conference was held on July 2nd,1906, between your committee and Sir Muncherjee Bhownagree, whowas acting on behalf of the Committee of the Zoroastrian Fund, yourThe Zoroastrian Trust Funds of Europe342"},{"pageNumber":362,"pageContent":"committee acceded to Sir Muncherjee Bhownaggree’s request andchanged the name ‘Parsi Club’ into ‘Parsi Social Union’.The stated aims and objectives were: 1. To promote and increasesocial intercourse and good will among members of the Parsi com-munity. 2. To bring Parsis into closer touch with Europeans andother nations of the East. 3. To hold debates and read papers onsocial, legal, scientific and literary subjects. 4. To afford every pos-sible assistance to Parsis who came over to Europe either for study,or business or health, or any other purpose.55The membership ofthe Union appears to have consisted predominantly of students.A later chairman ( J. C. Coyajee) stated that it had been formed tohelp people studying in the UK and under its regulations four of theseven managing trustees were to be students, plus correspondingmembers to represent the Union at the universities of Oxford,Cambridge and Edinburgh. The records also suggest a branch inManchester. Dadabhai Naoroji was the first vice-president, beforehe left for India, and members of distinguished families were promi-nent: Dorab J. N. Tata was a vice-president, B. D. Petit was presi-dent and S. A. Kapadia, the University College lawyer and authordiscussed above, was also involved. The first year’s programmeincluded lectures on Lakeland poets and one on ‘Cumnor, AnHistoric English Village’. At one of its functions there were 100 guests, including a member of the Persian legation and twoprominent political figures, Sir Thomas Barclay and Sir CurzonWyllie. But despite this aura of respectability there was conflict withthe Association. The first Annual Report relates that the Associationhad dissuaded the Northbrook Society from allowing the studentbody to use its rooms in Piccadilly, but the Union was able to havethe decision reversed and was put on the list of PrivilegedAssociations. In 1922 there was a spate of correspondence in theIndian press, in The Times of India, the Bombay Sanj Vartamanand theKarachi Parsi Sansar, when an article appeared (7 August) saying thatthe young people thought that ‘the Parsi Association of Europe istoo much under the control of elderly people and tends too muchtowards entertaining personages at expensive banquets...Theobject of the Union seems to be to create a rather less august andmore sociable centre for Parsis in London.’ Bhownaggree respondedon behalf of the Association, saying that the Union was ‘a veryThe Zoroastrian Trust Funds of Europe34355Rules and Regulations of the Parsi Social Union, 1907, p. 3."},{"pageNumber":363,"pageContent":"small body of very small means’. In this episode lay a foretaste ofproblems awaiting future diaspora communities, namely how to balance the interests of different groups when numbers limitedthe frequency, and therefore the range, of activities. WhatBhownaggree and his generation wanted was not what the youngstudents were looking for. Presenting an image of high social stand-ing for the long-term resident British Zoroastrians was not a particu-lar priority for students in Britain on a limited budget for a restrictedlength of time.Broacha HouseIronically, in view of the last words of the previous section, the firstlong-term planning for a building emerged from the student bodyin Edinburgh, where a number of Parsis came for medical studies.In 1909 the Parsi Union persuaded Sir Shapurji Broacha to estab-lish a student hostel and club there. He purchased a house, providedfurniture and an endowment for running the house, which was tobe named after him. The trustees were Broacha, Bhownaggree, aParsi student, Appoo and N. J. Mulla, and an Edinburgh law firm.Virtually nothing is heard of this hostel until major problems arosein the 1930s. The housekeeper, who had a fifteen-year lease, refusedto take Parsi students because if she did ‘the police would be afterher’. As she was known to have various European students theproblem was clearly one of colour prejudice. But, despite the fact that there were Parsi students looking for and being refusedaccommodation, it was found difficult to evict her until the end of her lease. Eventually the property was sold in 1947 and themoney donated to the Trust Funds in London.56The first attemptto buy a property for Zoroastrians in Britain therefore ended infrustration.Problems, growing numbers, and the need for a Zoroastrian houseThe numbers attending functions in the years before the FirstWorld War tended to be approximately one hundred. In 1911there were ninety-five individual subscribers to the Association,many of whom had some family here. But wartime problems, andThe Zoroastrian Trust Funds of Europe34456This account is based on M. H. Dadachanjee,Life Sketch of Sir Shapoorjee Bharucha,Bombay, 1928 (in Gujarati) and the Zoroastrian House file entitled ‘Broacha House’."},{"pageNumber":364,"pageContent":"the slump in the following years, reduced the numbers coming forbusiness, and some of those who were in Britain fell on hard timesand turned to the Association for help to return to India. Theseproblems are outlined in a letter dated 6 June 1917, in response toan appeal for money for a temple in India:The committee regret that your request for subscription to your fund hasnot much chance of being complied with, for the bulk of Parsi residentshere are students living on the allowances made by their parents for theireducation. There are very few here...[writing illegible] older residents,the calls upon whom for various purposes are so frequent and numerousespecially in the present troubled and distressed times, that you can eas-ily understand their inability to give any appreciable money help else-where. We ourselves have to support the funds of this association for thebenefit of distressed cases here and for maintaining the burial groundand other necessary communal expenses...the burdens of even livingexpenses owing to war and the urgent calls made for subscriptions invarious ways for help to soldiers and charities connected with the war.Similarly on 30 March 1922, the then secretary, Desai, wrote to Sir J. J. Modi, secretary of the BPP, explaining that the Associationdid not have the money to meet its demands. They had an incomeof £150, but in the previous eighteen months had to pay £120 toassist three individuals to return to India, and they currently had alady with two sons who was helpless and applying to theAssociation for aid. He explained that ‘in this country no Parseeshould be allowed to resort to begging or to be a charge upon the rates and thus tarnish the name and fame of the community in the Metropolis of the Empire.’ He explained that when theAssociation was formed it had been assumed that firms wouldflourish and that there would be only the odd instance of repatri-ation every five years, but the slump in the British economy meantthat they were unable to cope. While he was visiting Bombay laterthat year he went to the BPP to seek help for funds for this purposeand he reported to Bhownaggree on his return: ‘I had a little hotdiscussion with Sir C. J. Readymoney who began to criticise yourturning the Association into a Limited Company; ultimately theyassured me that they would be willing to help us in the repatriationof any Parsi when a demand is beyond our means.’57The Zoroastrian Trust Funds of Europe34557Letter dated 12 Aug. 1922. The allusion to the Limited Company refers to the formal Incorporation outlined above."},{"pageNumber":365,"pageContent":"It is worth illustrating the social work of the Association with aspecific example recorded in the Association files from the early1920s.58A lady from Bombay sought help in tracing her father inEngland. He had last been heard of in the Manchester area, sothe London Association sent letters to the Union WorkhouseHospital in Manchester, to Withington Hospital in Chorlton, toHope Hospital in Salford and to the Salford Union Infirmary inPendleton. In the last letter the secretary commented: ‘I beg topoint out that the gentleman referred to is a Parsi residing inEngland for nearly 60 years, and although as you say “coloured”he is whiter than a good European in every respect.’ Clearly thesecretary thought it necessary to dispel any false stereotype of anIndian. Eventually the man was found, given £50 and a second-class ticket back to Bombay. The search was, therefore, extensive,effective and charitable. More such work became necessary as theslump deepened.At the time that the funds were stretched, numbers were grow-ing and the need for a Zoroastrian house was increasingly pressed.Discussions began in earnest at a meeting on 16 December 1914under the urging of Mr F. Ilavna. The call was not just for a reli-gious building but for an administrative base and social centre. TheAssociation sold its Government of India bonds; Sir DhunjibhoyBomanji promised £5,000 and Dr E. J. Khory £1,500. Just as acommunal appeal was being launched in 1920, a property wasfound and purchased, 168 Cromwell Road, South Kensington, onthe road where Bhownaggree lived. But problems soon developedwith the house. It was larger than the Association needed, it wasin need of urgent and extensive renovation, which they could notafford, and it was devaluing because of its condition. It is clearfrom the correspondence files that the building was causing divi-sions in the community. In 1925 they disposed of the property.Despite some doubts about a property by Bhownaggree an alter-native was purchased, 11 Russell Road, Kensington. It was smallerthan the previous one, and was freehold. Different people fundeddifferent rooms, which were then named after them: the Bamjeeritual room, the Sir Dhunjibhoy and Lady Bomanji room for socialfunctions; the Khory room for ‘temporary shelter to indigentThe Zoroastrian Trust Funds of Europe34658The individuals are mentioned in the files, but for obvious reasons anonymity ispreserved in this account."},{"pageNumber":366,"pageContent":"Parsees stranded in England’. The building became a social cen-tre or club, for card games, billiards, etc; it was also a hostel andin part a ritual centre. The opening by Bhownaggree was reportedinThe Timesand was attended by dignitaries from London andBombay (Sir Dhunjibhoy and Lady Bomanji, Sir Jamsetji Jijibhoy,Sir Ness Wadia, Lady Dorabji Tata). The success of the newhouse was commented on in the AGM on 28 October 1931:Up to recent years the Association’s objects were confined mainly to themaintenance of the Community’s burial ground, the proper disposal ofremains, and the repatriation of any indigent member stranded inEurope...In recent years there has been a welcome addition to theactivities of the Association . . . the establishment of the House wherethey had now assembled had opened out what might be regarded as thesocial side of the Association...its amenities and functions [attracted]a larger and more frequent attendance at its communal gatherings.The burial club had grown into an Association, and now into acommunity.The funeral groundSeveral references have been made to the need for, and importanceof, a funeral ground, and it is important to give an overview of itshistory. The Trust Funds negotiated a burial area in the cemetery atBrookwood with the London Necropolis Company in 1863. Overthe years, the size of that plot and its facilities have grown. Itsboundary was marked by a hedge in 1863, with columns at theentrance to mark off the Zoroastrian boundary. In 1901 a ‘chapel’orsagdiwas erected, where prayers and appropriate purificationscould be undertaken. This, and other developments, were openedby Mrs Jerbai Wadia, widow of Naoroji N. Wadia. This was the firstattempt to carve out a distinctively Zoroastrian space in Britain andso it is worth quoting a contemporary account of the opening.The fire was kindled and some Avestan prayers were recited by Mr Kekobad B. Dastur Meherjirana and Mr Ardeshir M. Masani. SirGeorge Birwood delivered a lecture on the Parsis and the history of theirreligion. Then Sir M. M. Bhownagree KCIE, talked on the life of the lateMr Wadia and then Mr Nusserwanji Naoroji Wadia, one of the sons ofthe deceased, requested the Zoroastrian Fund Committee of London totake over the building in their care which was accepted by its President,Mr Dadabhoy Naoroji, on its behalf. The building and mausoleum arebuilt on the style of the Persepolis palace, the Astodan in the centreThe Zoroastrian Trust Funds of Europe347"},{"pageNumber":367,"pageContent":"resembles the Astodan of Cyrus at Pasargadae with seven steps fromwhere four paths lead in four directions at the end of which a door is sup-posed to be built.59The evocation of architectural motifs from the fifth-century BCEroyal palace of Persepolis, started by Darius, is an expression of theconsciousness of the Iranian ancestry of the Parsi community.Achaemenid symbols are commonly used on Bombay temples,especially those from the nineteenth century. But Persepolis was asource of inspiration for much later Iranian, e.g. Sasanian, as wellas Parsi art. The Zoroastrian section of Brookwood is thereforederived from the source of much ancient and modern religioussymbolism. The allusion to the Astodan of Cyrus is much less com-mon in Parsi art and suggests some knowledge of Iranian archae-ology. It is noticeable that the main royal burial ground nearPersepolis, Naqsh-i Rustam, was not used as a source of imagery.That funeral art is specifically concerned with the status of theking, whereas Persepolitan motifs became identified withZoroastrianism generally, and not only the royal person. A study ofthe gravestones at Brookwood suggests a development over theyears. The earliest gravestone is a conventional western headstone,devoid of any religious symbols but using the date from the Parsicalendar. Later ones began to emulate some Middle Eastern pat-terns, with pictures of the deceased, and on the sides of the stonesrepresentations of the fire and liturgical implements. The newspa-per reports also allude to the symbols of the Zoroastrian cosmos,with indication of the four directions, and the seven steps, sevenbeing a number at the heart of Zoroastrian theology: the sevenAmesha Spentas, the seven creations, etc. The dead were, there-fore, being laid to rest in a space clearly designated as Zoroastrian.Unfortunately, the opening of the religious building and theZoroastrian design of the cemetery have not been the end ofthe story of Brookwood, for there have been many problems overthe years with the owners. As the community grew, so membersbecame increasingly aware of the need for more space. It wasextended in 1908 with help from the Tata family, some of whosemembers are buried in Brookwood in splendid mausoleums.60In 1938 the community debated the possibility of cremating theThe Zoroastrian Trust Funds of Europe34859PPIV. 35.60Specifically, J. N. Tata, the ‘Captain of Indian industry’ and his sons Sir Ratan andSir Dorab J. Tata."},{"pageNumber":368,"pageContent":"dead, so that less burial ground would be needed. Some of the reli-gious issues at the 1938 AGM are worth quoting because others,both in India and in the diaspora, have raised similar points.Modern crematoria, one member ( Jilla) argued, are different fromtraditional Indian forms of cremation and cause less religiousoffence. ‘Disposal by exposure to Electric Radiant Heat Rays servesthe same purpose as solar rays and does away with the gruesomeidea of access to birds...Science teaches that fire can never bedefiled for it consumed all impurities but ultimately retains itsintegrity and remains pure by itself.’61It is important to note howdiaspora Zoroastrians, like members of other diaspora religiousgroups, have to rationalize the changes they are compelled bycircumstance to make.The problem of space at Brookwood continued into the post-Second World War era. There had been difficulties with the own-ers not maintaining the grounds, despite increasing the charges. In1974 the new owners, Maximillian Investments Ltd., tried to linktheir agreement to extensions to the sagdiwith a substantial chargeof £40,000 for more land, and a further increase in funeralcharges. They apparently assumed that the Association would havelittle choice but to comply. The matter went to court and eventu-ally an out-of-court settlement was reached which gave theAssociation the freehold of what they had already purchased; adja-cent land was purchased for £1, the Association’s legal fees werepaid and excess burial charges were returned. Clearly the settle-ment was a triumph for the Association, and justified the determi-nation of its leaders, notably the then vice-president, Shahpur F.Captain, not to submit to pressure. The extended sagdi, funded byArbab Rustom Guiv and the Zarthoshty brothers, was built.62An International CentreThere are several references in the files to the Association being‘at the heart of empire’.

Accepting responsibilityfor indigent Zoroastrians in Europe, which usually meant facil-itating their funeral; 2. Being used as a platform for appeals onbehalf of oppressed Iranian Zoroastrians.The earliest reference to the burial of an overseas Zoroastrianin London is to Mrs Dorabji Saklatvalla,63whose remains werebrought from New York. In 1916 the Association funded the trans-portation of the body of Maneckjee Sethna from Monte Carlo toLondon, and a year later the body of Ardeshir Patel from Paris.64In 1919 Mr R. D. Cooper was informed that he was the Frenchrepresentative of the Association, but I could find no reference toany subsequent contact. The longest-standing such commitmentwas for five Zoroastrian graves in Berlin from approximately 1923,because their families in India declined to look after them.65TheChurch took over their upkeep in 1986, very much against thewishes of the Association for they felt that Zoroastrians should lookafter their own. But their protests were ignored.Despite the heroic efforts of Hataria in mediating on behalf ofthe Iranian Zoroastrians to the Shah, the ruthlessly oppressedminority needed all the assistance and support that could beraised.66When the Shah, Nasir-i-Din, visited London in 1873, adeputation of four Parsis67went to Buckingham Palace to pleadthe cause of their co-religionists, and took with them Sir HenryRawlinson, former ambassador to Tehran, and E. B. EastwickMP. The Shah indicated that he would ‘give the subject his bestattention on his return to Persia’, but when nothing happened, theParsis made further representations through the British EmbassyThe Zoroastrian Trust Funds of Europe35063Shapurji Saklatvalla’s mother.64The brother of Madame Cama, who was exiled to Paris by the British for her polit-ical work in India.65The 1938 Annual Report reported success in tracing the names of the five peopleburied in Berlin.

On a further visit in 1899, theShah then in power, Muzaffar ad-din Qajar, also received a depu-tation of Parsis while he was in Europe. The address of welcomewas drawn up by Bhownaggree and presented by Naoroji to themonarch at the Royal Palace Hotel in Ostend. They had beenasked to make this approach by prominent Bombay Parsis (notablySir Dinshah Petit), so it was not simply London-based Parsis whosaw their position at the heart of empire as having political poten-tial. It is reasonable to assume that the fact that two of the Parsishad recently been, or were, MPs at Westminster would have left animpression on the Shah of the oppressed Zoroastrians having someinfluential European supporters.Other occasions were also used by members of the Associationto influence the Persian authorities. On 26 June 1907, a receptionwas held at the Criterion restaurant for the Persian ambassador onthe announcement of the new Shah’s accession to the throne.Under the new Shah (Mohammed Ali Shah Qajar) the parlia-ment, or Majlis, was established and a Zoroastrian, JamshidBahman Jamshidian, became a member. The sixty-six Parsisassembled in London presented an address for the amelioration ofconditions for the Iranian Zoroastrians, asking specifically:That he may grant to our co-religionists, who are subject to his sover-eignty, the same rights, privileges, and protection which His Majesty hasevinced his desire to extend to the Persian nation under the constitutionwhich has recently been inaugurated in his Empire.We are deeply sensible of the assurances conveyed to us and theunquestionable proof already given by His Imperial Majesty of theinterest he and his government feel in the welfare of our co-religionists.The privilege of representation granted to them in the new PersianParliament and the nomination of Arbab Jamshid to a seat there has, asYour Excellency is doubtless aware, evoked sentiments of gratitude fromall Parsees. We trust that this is an earnest of the genuine solicitude forthe welfare of the Zoroastrian subjects entertained by the PersianGovernment and we beg humbly to represent through you to HisImperial Majesty that every measure of justice, of generous kindness,and above all assured protection of their lives and property will begratefully repaid by their increasing loyalty and devotion to HisMajesty’s throne and august person.Another address drawn up by Bhownaggree was presented in acasket in London in 1919 to the last Shah of the Qajar dynastyThe Zoroastrian Trust Funds of Europe351"},{"pageNumber":371,"pageContent":"(Ahmed Shah Qajar), for which the Tehran Anjuman sent a letterof appreciation.68The next petition was presented at what turnedout to be a significant moment in Persian history: the coronationof the new Shah of the Pahlavi dynasty after the last Qajar hadbeen deposed. After some hesitation because of the uncertainty ofthe new political situation, at a meeting on 18 May 1926 a petitionwas unanimously agreed which included the words:Resolved that at this the first Meeting of the Committee of the ParseeAssociation of Europe, London, since the coronation of His ImperialMajesty Riza Shah Pahlavi as Shah-in-Shah of Persia the Committeebeg leave to convey their congratulations upon his accession.

They rejoice in the manyevidences of virility, justice and wise statesmanship, which were affordedby His Majesty during the years of his Prime Ministership. They trace tothis cause in large measure the restoration of good order and prosperityto the country, and in particular they beg to convey, with their felicita-tions, warm appreciation of the paternal interest His Majesty has shownin the welfare of their fellow Zoroastrians in Iran.The Persian chargé d’affaires promised in a letter to have the addresspresented to the new Shah, and subsequently attended a receptionorganized by the Association. Unusually, the new Shah signed thisacknowledgement personally. These incidents not only illustrate thefeeling that a London base could be used politically for the religion,but also demonstrate that the Zoroastrians in Britain were consciousof their Persian ancestry. At the time of the revolution in 1979,Zoroastrians from Britain joined those from other western countrieswho sought to do what was possible to protect the Zoroastrians inIran. It is not mere coincidence that the first world body, the WorldZoroastrian Organization, was started from London.After the Second World WarThe aftermath of warZoroastrians shared with the wider population the problems oflife in war-torn Britain.

At the conclusion ofthe war the Association sent a letter to the King’s private secretary:‘The Parsee community of London assembled at ZoroastrianHouse...to celebrate their New Year, take this opportunity tosend their humble and respectful duty and sincere congratulationsto Your Majesty at the successful conclusion of the World War andthe unconditional surrender of Germany and Japan.’69Althoughthe numbers of Zoroastrians increased after the war, mainlyowing to people in the Medical Corps settling in Britain andworking for the National Health Service, there are no recordswhich provide numbers. What the records show is that for sometwenty years the Association struggled, especially with its finances.Many Association members suffered, like the rest of the popula-tion, and many needed help, as did some of the new settlers. Thefunds had been depleted by the war effort, and the investments inGovernment securities lost much of their value because the WarCabinet had been forced to reduce their worth. Income tax hadincreased sharply so that expenditure exceeded income, and theAssociation had to eat into its capital. The situation was trans-formed in the 1960s and 1970s in various ways. In economicterms, a change of investment policy in 1962 helped the fundssignificantly; the Zoroastrians shared in the increasing wealth ofthe country; in 1979 the Association became a charitable institu-tion, which saved considerable sums in tax; and membership sub-scriptions increased in size appreciably with the numbers of newarrivals. In the 1960s many Zoroastrians migrated from India andPakistan, along with many South Asians, to Britain. The Parsi pat-tern of migration at this time mirrored that of the other SouthAsian communities: a few Parsis remained in East Africa, a fewwent to India and a small number to Canada, but most from EastAfrica and Aden settled in Britain. The increased number ofZoroastrians brought to a head a debate which had been simmeringfrom at least 1931, the need for a new house.A New Zoroastrian houseAt the AGM on 28 October 1931 mention was made of the grow-ing numbers of members at functions and on increasing use of theproperty for social events. But the war years and the economicThe Zoroastrian Trust Funds of Europe35369Letter file, 2 Sept. 1945."},{"pageNumber":373,"pageContent":"difficulties meant that little could be done for two decades.However, despite the considerable economic problems, withextensive work needed at the funeral ground and at Russell Road,and the numbers of indigent Parsis seeking assistance to return toIndia, the then president, Jehangir D. Moos, spearheaded a cam-paign for a new house. He produced a six-page document in 1959for use not only in Britain, but also in India, from where it wasassumed many of the funds might come. The document is worthquoting at length because it provides an unusually clear accountof a group’s self-perception at the time when the wider SouthAsian migration to Britain was in its early phase.The document begins with a brief history of the Association andrecords some early benefactions. It notes that whereas the old househad accommodated functions when only seventy people came, nowit needed space for 165 people and as a result ‘members of ourCommunity are reluctant to go to a crowded Zoroastrian Houseafter their first visit and they stay away.’ The document then com-ments on the religious needs of members: ‘A Zoroastrian cannotlive by bread alone. The spiritual side of life is of vital importanceto any Religious Community.’ This is a significant indicator of afurther changing emphasis in the self-perception of theAssociation, from an informal burial club, to a social body, now to‘a Religious Community’. The document then explains why religionis increasingly important:In the midst of highly organised and liberally subsidised ProselytisingReligions, we Zoroastrians are fighting a losing battle...As our peopleare naturally inclined towards religion, they inevitably drift into one orother of the highly organised religions which keep open doors andreceive you with open arms. They have so much more to offer with theirpowerful resources in the way of highly paid, learned lecturers andpriests, wonderfully furnished and well appointed Churches and placesof worship...In the absence of religious instruction in our own insti-tutions, our children naturally learn and adopt other religions in theSchools and in social contacts. The first generation of Zoroastrians whocame to live in Europe, generally have the necessary training and know-ledge to follow their own religion. The second generation is rarely prop-erly instructed, and the process of merging with others becomesevident. The third generation is almost completely lost to our religion.This process has been going on for the last hundred years and we havelost some of our best sons and daughters to other communities.The Zoroastrian Trust Funds of Europe354"},{"pageNumber":374,"pageContent":"The document continues on the subject of religion, arguing that:Our great religion has contributed very largely to the subsequent reli-gions including Judaism and Christianity; and the Greek civilisation owesa great debt to our Religion...We are,therefore, naturally anxious topreserve our heritage for posterity...All Great Religions have a com-mon purpose, but owing to our different backgrounds, we all feel moreat home in our own religion and further we are more likely to makequicker progress, ethically and spiritually, by following our own in whichwe were born. It is part of our make-up, therefore we must preserve andnot destroy that which is of spiritual value to us.The document concludes: ‘A spacious House, a large AssemblyHall, a proper place of worship worthy of our tradition is a realnecessity.’ Moos’ affirmation of the long-held desire for a properplace of worship is consistent with the aims set out in 1861; whatis interesting is how he sets that long-standing wish in the contextof the changes in the 1960s. The document thus highlights thedangers seen by others who settled in the West in the twentiethcentury: the threat of proselytizing religions, the lure of goodfacilities, the danger of contact with people from other religionseroding Zoroastrian commitment, and the erosion of identity oversuccessive generations. But the document, like others to follow inAmerica and Australia, takes great pride in the historical import-ance of Zoroastrianism, and affirms the widespread Zoroastrianbelief that people should remain in the tradition into which theywere born. Moos foresaw in the 1950s what others would arguedecades later.Moos started the quest for raising funds in 1959 and receivedpromises of support from Bombay and Pakistan, but as progressappeared slow, several members became dispirited and asked fortheir money back. But when 88 Compayne Gardens was found,things moved quickly. It was a property that was reasonably cen-tral, large, near an underground station, and because it was in needof substantial renovation the price was not too high. TheAssociation was able to buy it without borrowing, simply by sellingoff some investments. It was opened on 6 September 1969 by thepresident of the BPP, Nadirshah Mulla, with 350 members assem-bled. It must have been the biggest Zoroastrian function held in theWest. A jashanwas performed with eight priests, led by Dastur Dr Sohrab Kutar, who then carried out ‘the age-old ceremony ofThe Zoroastrian Trust Funds of Europe355"},{"pageNumber":375,"pageContent":"“Boi-Maachi” in the Keeblah. Thereafter Members in turn offeredtheir Prayers in the presence of the holy Fire created by DasturjiSahib.’70Because members were aware that there were manyZoroastrians ‘out there’ who did not belong to the Association,they were convinced of the need for an extension to accommod-ate a larger meeting and function room. This was opened in 1983thanks to the munificence of Arbab Rustom Guiv and theZarthoshty brothers, benefactors who had facilitated the extensionto the sagdiat Brookwood. In the discussions about the physicalprovision for larger social functions two of the prominent leadersin the 1970s, Dr (Mrs) Shirin Kutar and Shahpur Captain, drewattention to the number of Zoroastrians from East Africa whowere not yet involved in the Association and whose membershipthey should encourage.71There have been attempts to obtain the services of a full-timepriest; indeed at one time there were strenuous efforts to fund sucha post for Sir J. J. Modi, who as well as being secretary of the BPP,and a priest, was also an important scholar. But the funds couldnot be raised. On one occasion a priest was appointed, but ten-sions arose between him and the Association and finding life incold, wet London hard, he returned to India. The priests have,therefore, been part-time, individuals who came from priestlyfamilies but migrated for educational or business reasons. Therehave been many devoted and hard-working individuals, but one,Dr Sohrab H. Kutar, stands out. He graduated as a medical doc-tor in Bombay in 1935, though during university vacations he hadworked in an agiary in Poona, something not common in the dia-spora priesthood. He arrived in Britain shortly before the out-break of war and volunteered to join the Royal Army MedicalCorps, serving for over five years with the Eighth Army. FieldMarshal Montgomery decorated him with the Star of Africa forhis work in the North Africa campaign. He was subsequentlytransferred to the Corps in India. At the end of the war, he andhis new wife, Shirin, moved back to London and started a hus-band and wife medical practice. In 1964 he was the first, and stillthe only, mobed living outside India and Iran to be recognized byThe Zoroastrian Trust Funds of Europe35670The quotation is taken from an unpublished document duplicated by the Associationto record the event.71Meetings files for 31 Jan. 1970 and 4 June 1978."},{"pageNumber":376,"pageContent":"the priestly authorities in the old country as a Dastur. There wassome debate over this recognition because in his medical work henecessarily came into contact with pollution, for example, thesamples for laboratory tests. But the Bombay High Priests decreedthat because in his work and in his person he was a priest of thehighest ideals, he was a fit person to be a Dastur.72He wasformally presented with a shawl as a token of his authority on 17 January 1965, a position he held until his death on 20 April1984. He was a quiet, rather shy man, deeply honourable andprofoundly spiritual, so that he was respected by all who met him,including myself. During his Dasturship there were no acrimoniousreligious debates in the Association. Unfortunately, deep religiousdivisions did break out after his death.With the growing numbers, and in particular with the changingcomposition of the membership, which now included not onlyZoroastrians from East Africa but also Iranian Zoroastrians afterthe revolution, it became necessary to redraft the constitution; inparticular the term ‘Parsee Association’ was no longer appropriate.The charitable status also demanded such a revision. As religionwas emphasized more from the time of Moos as President, andespecially in the new house, so the ethnic term Parsi, as well asbeing offensive to Iranians, became less appropriate; so in 1971and 1979 the redrafted constitution of the renamed ‘ZoroastrianTrust Funds of Europe (Incorporated)’ came into being.The growth of local associationsFrom the 1980s a number of formal local Associations have beenestablished; there had been informal groups in Leicester in the1970s, in Newcastle upon Tyne in the early 1980s. The NorthLondon Zoroastrian Association (NOLZA) was formed in 1982‘to meet the local needs of the Zoroastrian community in the con-text of Ethnic Community Development in North London and isin no way a rival body competing with the long establishednational organisation.’73The constitution of this body emphas-ized educational and social concerns more than religious activ-ities. Unusually for Zoroastrian groups it emphasized that it was a‘voluntary self-help ethnic minority Community Group’. It was,The Zoroastrian Trust Funds of Europe35772For further details on Dastur Kutar see my Selected Works, pp. 277–9.73Personal letter from the first chairman, Faredun Madan, 15 Oct. 1989."},{"pageNumber":377,"pageContent":"therefore, eligible for local ethnic-minority funding, a source ofincome which many Zoroastrian groups do not seek, believingthat they should not ask for public money. In becoming affiliatedto Haringey Community Relations Council, NOLZA identifieditself with the wider Indian community more than is commonamong Zoroastrian diaspora groups. NOLZA does this becauseits founder works in community relations and sees his own com-munity within the wider local context. A similar group was set upin nearby Harrow. Each Association had around 200 members inthe 1990s, though at the beginning of the millennium NOLZA isnot very active. The Harrow group is similar to NOLZA in that itbrings Zoroastrians together at the local level. It is different in thatit does not seek ethnic-minority funding and though some of itsmembers are engaged in community relations, the group as awhole has not tied itself into that network as closely as NOLZA.NOLZA had an Iranian office bearer, whereas Harrow consists ofpeople from India and Pakistan. The two groups have sharedsocial occasions, but the Harrow group has been more involved ineducational debates and inter-faith dialogue.A smaller group was started in south London, mainly aroundWimbledon, in 1988. This group tends to leave the religious func-tions to the ZTFE and concentrates on social functions of a dis-tinctly Parsi nature, with nataks, Parsi food, day trips, educationallectures and visits.The most recently formally established group is the NorthwestZoroastrian Community, formed in Manchester in 1987.74It is amore mixed Association than the others, including among itsfounders Zoroastrians from India, Pakistan, East Africa (bothZanzibar and Kenya) and Iranian Zoroastrians. The group hashad to address the question of intermarriage because, havingbeen so scattered and with little or no previous contact withZoroastrians (one member had not met a Zoroastrian for thirtyyears), many have married out. Non-Zoroastrians are welcome asassociate members, and come to the social functions, but not tothe prayers which precede such functions. The group cametogether when the founders were in their forties, bringing upThe Zoroastrian Trust Funds of Europe35874SeeCommunity Celebration: North West Zoroastrians Entering the Millenium, 1987–97,Manchester, 1997, with memories of founding members and profiles of many in theircommunity."},{"pageNumber":378,"pageContent":"young children and wanting them to mix with fellow Zoroastrians.As the children grow up, and the founders become elders, the groupis not as active in the third millennium as it was in the early 1990s,but it continues to meet fruitfully and amicably. So, for example,when the Bombay High Priest Dastur Kotwal visited England in2000, he visited Manchester (and Durham) to perform a jashan.It is inevitable that these smaller, and necessarily less formal,groups, change more quickly than does ZTFE. Being smaller theyare more influenced by their leaders: for example, Madan’s influ-ence in linking NOLZA with community relations work, and theNorthwest community meeting around three particular familieswith young children. The fact that the issues that bring the mem-bers together are transient does not lessen their value, but makesit more difficult for the historian to paint a longer term picture.Zoroastrians in British PoliticsZoroastrians consistently emphasize that they are loyal to thegovernment of whichever country they live in, hence the fact thatParsis fought on both sides during the Indo-Pakistan conflict.They have also taken an active part in the politics of several coun-tries where they have settled in the old diasporas. Because thisbook is about the diaspora, there has been no mention of the roletaken by Zoroastrians in Iranian politics as soon as they werepermitted to take part in the twentieth century: the closeness ofKaikhusroo Shahrokh to the Shah, and the work of FarhangMehr as Deputy Finance Minister, then Deputy Prime Minister,under the last Shah (discussed in Ch. 10 below), to name but twoexamples.75In earlier chapters we have seen Parsis involved in theIndian National Congress, Bombay politics, the Parliament inPakistan and the new Kenyan Parliament. Political activity hasalso been a feature of Zoroastrian life in Britain.Zoroastrians in local politicsThe first Zoroastrian known to have achieved office in localgovernment was Naoroji D.

She has, thereafter,campaigned on various political issues, mostly women’s rights,ethnic minority issues and at the turn of the millennium, commu-nity relations. In 2000, a long-serving committee member ofZTFE, Filly R. Mavalwalla, was elected mayor of Redbridge inSurrey, the first Asian to achieve this. He brought something of hisreligion with him into office, arranging for a visiting High Priest,Dastur Kotwal, to give a lecture at the town hall, and having as hischaplain one of the senior priests from Zoroastrian House, so thatZoroastrian prayers could be recited at civic functions. There ismuch pride among the Zoroastrians that their members serve thewider community, and in the positive image this gives to their religion. They are particularly proud of the fact that the first threeAsian MPs elected to the Westminster Parliament were all Parsis.Zoroastrians in national politicsIn view of the fact that Zoroastrians provided the first three AsianMPs at Westminster, it is ironic that in 1833, the MP for OxfordUniversity expressed disbelief that a Parsi might become an MP. Ina debate on whether to allow Jews into Parliament, the questionwas asked ‘Where do we stop? If you once admit into the House ofCommons people who deny the authority of the Gospels, will youlet in a Mussalman? Will you let in a Parsee? Will you let in aHindoo, who worships a lump of stone with seven heads?’79Sixtyyears later there was a Parsi Member of Parliament!The Zoroastrian Trust Funds of Europe36076PPIV. 55 and his obituary on 15 Nov. 1935,PPVIII. 258.77PPVI. 224.78PPVI. 315.79See on the Member for Oxford University’s speech T.

During his academic careerhe was an active social reformer, campaigning for female education(even organizing home tuition for young ladies), against infantmarriage and for the remarriage of widows. Within the Parsi com-munity, he started the religious reforming society ‘RahnumaeMazdayasnian Sabha’ and what was originally a campaigningreformist newspaper,Rast Goftar—which ironically turned againstthe INC and Dadabhai. From 1855 to 1874 he was mainly basedin England, first working with the Camas to start an Indian firm in1855, and then from 1859 trading on his own account. He used hisincome to become involved in politics. He was long convinced thatthe British were fundamentally just, but that they were ignorantabout India; his crusade was therefore to inform in order to reformBritish rule. Perhaps his most famous remark in this context is thefollowing:We Indian people believe in one thing, and that is that although JohnBull is a little thick-headed, once we can penetrate through his head intohis brain that a certain thing is right and proper to be done, you can bequite sure that it will be done.81In 1865 he formed the London Indian Society (later the East IndiaAssociation), which held regular lectures about the condition ofIndia and sought to attract MPs and political leaders. During the1860s he began to elaborate his ‘drain theory’, arguing, thatalthough Britain made important contributions to India, e.g. roadsand education, she nevertheless drained away more of India’swealth through taxation and through the high-earning officials inIndia investing their money back in Britain. This will be elaboratedbelow in the section on his parliamentary contribution. At the endThe Zoroastrian Trust Funds of Europe36180There are two main substantial books on Nauroji, R. P.

He became a member of the Bombay MunicipalCorporation and Town Council. He started the Voice of India,anewspaper that collected and disseminated Indian public opinion asreflected in the native press. In 1855 he had been instrumental informing the Bombay Association, a society committed to informingBritish opinion in order to reform the rule. That Association soonlapsed, so in 1885 Naoroji was involved in setting up a revived body,the Bombay Presidency Association; these two bodies were the pre-cursors to the Indian National Congress. But by 1884 Naoroji wasalready convinced that the only base from which to influence Britishpolicy was London, and so he began the campaign to win a parlia-mentary seat. At the age of 60, therefore, he moved back to Londonto begin the next and most public phase of his life.His first attempt to win a seat (the Holborn constituency) wasalways a lost cause, because with the snap election he had only twoweeks to campaign in what was a safe Tory seat. But he immedi-ately sought a winnable constituency. It took five years of internalparty feuding for him to win the nomination for Central Finsbury.In August 1887 he won the most votes to be the prospective can-didate, but successive rival opponents were put up against him.Although the records do not prove it, there is little doubtthat he was opposed on racial grounds. When he stood in theGeneral Election in July 1892 he was elected, by just three votes.A recount increased that to five votes, and then his Tory opponentalleged campaigning irregularities. The case was withdrawn fivemonths later, and so after five years of acrimonious dispute,Naoroji was secure in his position as MP. His supporters hadincluded prominent Liberals, notably William Wedderburn (anINC sympathizer) and ex-Viceroys. Racial prejudice was evid-enced in the campaigning. The then Prime Minister, LordSalisbury, referred to him in a public speech as ‘a blackman’, andearned for himself a rebuke from the Queen, and much sympath-etic support for Naoroji. In his campaign he was presented asThe Zoroastrian Trust Funds of Europe362"},{"pageNumber":382,"pageContent":"being ‘really’ British and he campaigned on local, not Indian,issues. After his victory some of the press chided his constituentsfor electing ‘an Asiatic fire-worshipper’.Naoroji’s parliamentary messageDuring his three years in Parliament Naoroji spoke fifty-threetimes: twenty times on the condition of India; eight times on theIndian Civil Service (ICS); five times concerning a proposed RoyalCommission on Indian affairs; four times on the Indian currency;twice on Indian opium revenues; and he was involved in the presentation of ten petitions.82His most active year inParliament was 1893, when he spoke twenty-nine times, speakingfor up to two hours at a time (as was not unusual for his day),which amounts to a lot of words addressed to Parliament!83Theunderlying theme of practically all his speeches was the ‘draintheory’. He employed his mathematical ability to document, indetail, his conviction that £1,600,000,000 had been transferredfrom India to Britain not only through tax, but also throughBritish officials investing their money back in Britain from theirsalaries in India raised from the Indian taxpayer. He pointed outthat India had been required to fund not only Indian concerns butalso British Imperial interests that were of no interest to India. Forexample, in his submission to the Welby Commission in 1896 heprotested that India provided £16 million of the total £21 millionfor the Afghan Wars, and that Indians had been among the forcesto fight and die, thus shedding their blood as well as paying mostof the costs of this British conquest.84Similarly he argued thatthey had been required to shed their blood for and fund theAbyssinian campaign, which had been pursued merely to saveface after a public insult.85Further, he questioned why IndiaThe Zoroastrian Trust Funds of Europe36382The chapter in Zoroastrians in Britaindeploys a number of quotes and extensive cross-referencing to other speeches in the footnotes, a level of detail not possible in a relativelyshort section within a chapter.83In addition to Zoroastrians in Britainand the books referred to in n. 80 f. see C.

The Indian Civil Service entry examinations were,for example, timetabled so that Indians were disadvantaged. Theywere held only in England, requiring a lengthy and costly overseasstay, at a young age (22) when Indians could not hope to havecaught up on the advantages of people educated in England.Furthermore, the examination was based on the public school syl-labus. Naoroji campaigned for simultaneous examinations inIndia and England for the ICS, and for a common results liststrictly in order of merit. He argued that here, and in the IndianMedical Service (IMS), favour was shown to the British, contra-vening Queen Victoria’s proclamation on becoming Empress ofIndia in 1858 that ‘our subjects of whatever race or creed be freelyand impartially admitted to offices in our service, the duties ofwhich they may be qualified, by their education, ability andintegrity, duly to discharge’.87He argued that justice was vital inthe Empire: ‘The whole problem of India is in a nutshell. Nevercan a foreign rule be anything but a curse to any country, exceptin so far as it approaches a native rule.’ In the House he com-mented: ‘Brute force may make an Empire, but brute force wouldnot maintain it; it was moral force and justice and righteousnessalone that would maintain it.’88Naoroji’s influenceNaoroji is commonly referred to as ‘the Grand Old Man ofIndia’, and in India he became a national hero.

In later Parsi literature he is always referredto in terms of awe. But it was not always thus. When he first indic-ated his plan to seek a parliamentary seat, several leaders, notablyPherozeshah Mehta and Wedderburn, said that he would bebetter employed campaigning in India. Some of the establishmentfigures feared that his involvement in party politics would countagainst them when the opposition came to power. His work inParliament gives at least a first impression of success: he startedthe Indian Parliamentary Party for members of any party whohad an interest in Indian affairs, aimed at increasing knowledgeabout, and interest in, Indian debates. He campaigned for a RoyalCommission on Indian finance and was made a member of it.Some political opponents sought to undermine his popular esteemas ‘the Member for India’ by pointing out that he was a memberof a minority race with experience in only one part of India. Butthis attempt failed, the farcical nature of the charge demonstratedby the acclaim afforded him in India and the Indian press. He evenmanaged to get a motion through Parliament to support the Indiancause in ICS examinations, against Government’s wishes. But theharsh truth is that he was not successful in provoking MPs’ inter-ests in the problems of peoples thousands of miles a way from theirown constituencies. The membership of the Royal Commissionwas chosen to defeat his wishes and the minority report he andWedderburn submitted was ignored, as was the parliamentaryvictory he obtained.The end of Naoroji’s careerIn the early years of the twentieth century Naoroji increasinglymoved to the political Left, towards the Socialists. Although hecarefully avoided calling for violent demonstrations he forecastsuch violence with ever-greater frequency. By 1904 he was callingfor Indian Independence. In his speech at the Socialist Congressat Amsterdam, 14–20 August 1904, he declared:Imperialism of brute force is barbarism. The Imperialism of civilisationis the Imperialism of equal rights, equal duties, and equal freedoms. Theremedy is in the hands of the British people.

He formed a strongfriendship with Sir George Birdwood, and through him met manyinfluential political and social figures. He became involved on thecommittee, chaired by the Prince of Wales, for the mounting ofthe Imperial Exhibition in 1886, in which context he met andworked with political leaders and royalty. For his work on the com-mittee he was made a Companion of the Indian Empire (CIE).He returned to India in 1887 where, at the Maharajah’s request,he drew up a radically reforming state constitution. Family sourceshave related to me an interesting detail: as a token of thanks theMaharajah gifted him ownership rights of several villages. Heaccepted these out of courtesy to the Maharajah, but he willed thatthe villages be returned to the state on the death of his offspringbecause he did not believe that anyone had the right to own peo-ple or land on a hereditary principle. During this return visit toIndia he was associated with several reforming causes, notably insupport of female education and he campaigned for the rights ofIndian women, and gave evidence to the Public ServiceCommission in favour of employing more natives in the Indianadministration.In 1888 Bhownaggree’s sister died and he was clearly deeplyaffected by her death. In his letters he speaks of himself asdepressed, and he gave several charitable benefactions in her name.It was during this period that he appears to have come into conflictwith the INC.

Wacha, blamedBhownaggree for the article, though as McLeod points out, thereis no evidence for this and as it was written during his sister’s ill-ness, which preoccupied his thoughts, it may be thought unlikelythat he wrote it. Three years later he returned to England alone;his wife stayed in India because the English climate did not suither. He began to seek a parliamentary seat, writing to Sir GeorgeBirdwood to emphasize that not all Indians supported the INC.The first public hint that he was seeking a seat came at a banquetThe Zoroastrian Trust Funds of Europe367"},{"pageNumber":387,"pageContent":"in honour of Naoroji in 1892. His cause provoked differentresponses. Simon Digby, an ally of Naoroji, supported him, andNaoroji never opposed him in public. But the leaders of the INCwere bitter in their attacks. Prominent in the onslaught was Wacha,the Parsi Secretary of the INC, later prominent in the WesternIndian Liberal Federation, and Naoroji’s main source of Indianinformation. In letters to Naoroji he spoke of ‘that pomposity of“Bow and agree” ’ and later in 1896 he said: ‘as to this busybodyBhownuggree he is determined to play the grand role.’93But in theyears 1891–4, as McLeod shows, Bhownaggree’s perception ofwhich place constituted his home changed from India to London,where he had an ever-growing circle of influential and politicalfriends, including former and future Viceroys. He was active inmeeting and helping numerous Indian, especially Parsi, visitors toLondon. Bhownaggree was involved from 1891 in the royal plans toturn the Imperial Exhibition into a permanent institute. He was byno means alone among Indian leaders in opposing the link betweenthe Indian cause and just one party, the Liberals, and in a two-partystate, where the other party will in due course come to power, theircase was not unreasonable. Bhownaggree was also concerned thatthe British rulers should not stereotype all Indian leaders as radicals.His emergence as a parliamentary candidate was the outcome ofmany quiet discussions; McLeod has managed to unearth more ofthese than any previous writer. The more prominent Bhownaggreebecame, the shriller became Wacha’s attacks.Bhownaggree in ParliamentBhownaggree’s election was a surprise. He was the third candid-ate to be approached to stand for what was thought of as anunwinnable seat, yet he achieved a clear majority in North EastBethnal Green constituency. In part this seems to have been dueto complacency on the part of the Liberals; also, Bhownaggreewas a good orator and ran an efficient campaign on English, notIndian issues. For example, he opposed the disestablishment ofthe Church of England and was against Home Rule for Ireland.On the personal side he stressed that he had lived in England forfourteen years and had a special interest in constitutional affairs.As a result Bhownaggree entered Parliament as Naoroji left it.The Zoroastrian Trust Funds of Europe36893For detailed references see the paper in Selected Works."},{"pageNumber":388,"pageContent":"Once in Parliament he discoursed eloquently on the blessings ofBritish rule in India, referring to ‘our Empire’. He attacked suchINC leaders as Sir William Wedderburn in terms which the estab-lished English press, notably The Daily Telegraphand the ManchesterGuardian, thought were intemperate. He believed that the aim ofeducation in India was not to remove British rule, but to educatethe Indian people so that they might profit from being part of theEmpire. There is, therefore, some support for the view ofBhownaggree as cravenly pro-British. However, in my opinion,this view cannot be sustained if a careful study is undertaken ofhis parliamentary message.Bhownaggree made 182 of his 267 parliamentary interventionson Indian affairs, with a further forty-four on Indians in SouthAfrica. He made forty-one interventions in British affairs, of whichtwenty-five were on local Bethnal Green issues. Whatever his elec-tion campaign emphasis, his parliamentary work was India-focused. Like Naoroji he attacked the drain of Indian resources(actually using Naoroji’s term). But the two men’s understanding ofthe drain and how to deal with it were different. Like Naoroji,Bhownaggree condemned the imposition of Indian taxes forcauses which did not benefit India, for example the annexation ofChitral, the garrison in South Africa (1903) and the Tibet cam-paign (1903–4). Similarly, he attacked the increase in British milit-ary pay out of Indian taxes. He also protested that the garrison inIndia was twice the size it needed to be and was paid for by Indiantaxpayers.94Regarding this financial injustice he warned: ‘ThePatience and fortitude of the people in India were severely put tothe test. More even than their bodily sufferings, their mental con-dition was one of extreme strain and anxiety.’ He warned of thedanger of political firebrands if policy continued as it was.In one sense, Bhownaggree was more radical in his views on edu-cation than Naoroji. He dismissed arts education as producing toomany intellectuals who were mere ‘spouters and writers’ (it is notirrelevant to note the number of arts graduates among the INCleadership). He campaigned for workshops and scientific laborat-ories, and technological developments to aid the Indian economyand avoid the crippling excess of imports over exports, especiallyimports of basic items for daily life. He criticized governmentThe Zoroastrian Trust Funds of Europe36994Ibid., pp. 312 f."},{"pageNumber":389,"pageContent":"restrictions on existing Indian industries. He feared that the declineof traditional industries would result in the further impoverishmentof India. This trading imbalance was what Bhownaggree identifiedas the great drain of India’s wealth. Throughout his parliamentarycareer he called for forestry schools, polytechnics, industrial schoolsand industrial exhibitions to aid Indian manufacturers. Heappealed for grants for Indians to pursue practical and technicalsubjects in Europe, urged that the Imperial Institute, to whichIndians had donated, should do more for Indians. He protestedwhen the Cooper’s Hill Engineering College, established to helpBritish people study engineering before going to India, was closedbecause of lack of students, yet Indians were excluded. UnlikeNaoroji, he campaigned for the expansion of the railway network.Naoroji feared that this would increase India’s debt, whereasBhownaggree believed that it would help industry and the smoothmovement of supplies at times of famine. The Indian newspaperIndian Spectator, allied with the INC, urged Bhownaggree to pursuemore modest reforms in education.Bhownaggree also campaigned more vigorously for justice thanhas been acknowledged. In 1900 he protested that Indian mem-bers of the Indian Medical Service were excluded from seniorposts. Such racial considerations, he argued, were ‘inconsistentwith the traditions of British rule in India’. Like Naoroji beforehim, he pointed out the inconsistency of such practices with thepromises of the Queen Empress. He campaigned against theimposition of the Salt Tax, because this had the greatest effect onthose who could least afford it (1903). In 1905 he noted with con-cern the rising numbers of refusals of appeals to the Secretary ofState for India. On several occasions he protested at the lack ofmedical or educational provision for labourers’ children on teaand other plantations, and he spoke out for the rights of lascars onP & O ships.The campaign with which he was most associated was the causeof Indians in South Africa. In forty-four parliamentary interven-tions, he argued that Britain was not honouring the pledges ofequality of all subjects. In the late nineteenth century, Indianswere treated badly in what was then the independent TransvaalRepublic. When the Boer War broke out in 1889 many observersexpected that a British victory would mean an improvement ofconditions. This did not happen and annexation of the TransvaalThe Zoroastrian Trust Funds of Europe370"},{"pageNumber":390,"pageContent":"to the British Empire in 1900 was followed by an increase in racialdiscrimination against Indians. He argued that Indian subjects:‘were treated in a manner that was a disgrace to the Empire, wererobbed of the rights that belonged to them not only as citizens ofthe Empire, but as human beings, without a word of protest fromstatesmen...no wonder this talk of care for Indian interests wasregarded as hollow by the whole community of India.’ In SouthAfrica in particular, but in the debate on countless other subjectsalso, Bhownaggree consistently and powerfully attacked any hintof racism directed against Indian citizens. McLeod’s account ofBhownaggree’s South Africa campaign is particularly acute. In ithe shows that Bhownaggree had conceived of a Briton being any-one within the Empire, and that the authority to rule dependednot on whether one was English or Indian, white or not-white, buton class, education and social standing. McLeod also demon-strates a much closer contact between Bhownaggree and Gandhithan I had indicated in my previous writings, at least until 1909,when it seems that Gandhi began to ignore Bhownaggree’s advice.The precise reason is not clear, for by then Bhownaggree’s worthand role were being increasingly recognized if not by Wacha, atleast by other prominent leaders such as Gokale, who came topower in Congress in 1903.In my previous publications I argued that Bhownaggree’s posi-tion changed following his 1896 tour of India. I suggested that theopposition he faced shook him and that this caused him to softenhis stand. McLeod has shown that to be wrong. The perception ofsuch Indian antagonism was over-influenced by Wacha’s accounts;Bhownaggree himself sought a quiet visit for at least much of thetime because he had gone to India to grieve with his family on hismother’s recent death. The adverse newspaper reports were due toWacha’s backstage pressure, displaying what McLeod describes asa pathological hatred of Bhownaggree. In some cases the news-papers even changed their original stand after Wacha had contactedthem. The secretary of the INC clearly wielded substantial influ-ence, for example by refusing Bhownaggree’s request to attend theannual meeting of the INC. On his return, as McLeod shows,Bhownaggree’s assaults on Congress and the Indian language presswere among his fiercest yet. His probing questions in Parliamentoften yielded important information that would not otherwise have been available. He maintained pressure on the Government The Zoroastrian Trust Funds of Europe371"},{"pageNumber":391,"pageContent":"in respect of India, often asking questions that one suspectsGovernment did not want to be asked. Government commonlyignored his suggestions, but a detailed reading of his contributionsreveals stern questioning, which on one occasion led to him votingagainst his own party and on others abstaining, something BritishMPs are not supposed to do. In the Jubilee New Years Honours list(1897) he was knighted for his services. McLeod dates the easing oftensions with the INC from about 1900, as Gokhale supported thesort of educational and industrial reforms Bhownaggree had longcampaigned for, and as Bhownaggree focused his attention evermore on South Africa, a campaign that even Wacha did not attack.Bhownaggree’s standingMcLeod has shown, contrary to what I had written, thatBhownaggree was active after he left Parliament, but in a differentway. He became the elder statesman, above the party-politicaldivide. He also needed the support of both parties, and of Congress,for his campaign in South Africa. He was seen in many circles as themost prominent Indian figure in Britain and as a result was invitedto take part in, or chair, various committees and campaigns. He was,for example, chairman of the Northbrook Indian Society, the EastIndia Association and the Indian Social Club and he presided overthe welcome given to Gokhale on his 1912 London visit. He wasalso, of course, the president of the Parsee Association of London.His work there is discussed elsewhere in this chapter. The records atZoroastrian House in London include two letters written toBhownaggree by the prominent Iranian Zoroastrian, KaykhusrowShahrokh (in the letter he adds ‘Kermani’ as indication of his birth-place). The letters illustrate his high standing in the Zoroastrianworld. One letter, dated 10 April 1907, was a covering note sent witha copy of a book Shahrokh had written in Persian aboutZoroastrianism to increase knowledge of the Good Religion bothwithin and outside the community. The opening of the letter reads:Dear Respected Sir,How much fortunate shall I be to reach to the high dignity of gainingthe honour of representing myself as an atom before the rays of the sunof your Excellencies benevolence.It is, of course, customary in Iran to use what might be seen insome other cultures as flowery introductions, but the whole tenorThe Zoroastrian Trust Funds of Europe372"},{"pageNumber":392,"pageContent":"of the letter indicates a high esteem of Bhownaggree. In a furtherletter, dated 19 April 1909, he explicitly states that Bhownaggree’spolitical and social standing benefits Zoroastrians: ‘Because yourExcellency advances in High ranks, the effect is our happy dayand succession here.’It is difficult to assess his relations with Naoroji. There are indi-cations that the two worked together at Zoroastrian House, andthat Bhownaggree respected Naoroji’s achievements. For example,he presided at a banquet to fête Naoroji after his election toParliament. Neither appears to have attacked the other publicly. Itseems that the relationship began reasonably. In the Naorojiarchive in the National Archives of India in Delhi there are severalletters from Bhownaggree to Naoroji during the period September1870 to May 1904. The earlier letters strike a cordial tone. Forexample, on 8 September 1891 Bhownaggree wrote:My dear Mr DadabhaiWill you give me the pleasure of your company at dinner here[Northbrook Indian Club] tomorrow at 1.30 please. I am askingBadhurjee to whom I intend it as a little farewell and also Sir S. Birdwood,Mr Wardle the great silk man who has taken such an interest in Indianindustry, Mr Judge [writing becomes illegible] and Digby. I hope youwill come.95The letters show that each sought the help of the other in variouscauses, such as raising subscriptions to honour Birdwood96or tablingquestions in the House of Commons.97On Naoroji’s requestBhownaggree made a private approach to Neville Chamberlain on behalf of some Parsis in South Africa;98the two took up the caseof the Revd Eduljee, who had been falsely accused and imprisonedon a charge of animal abuse.99Until 1893 the letters are friendlierThe Zoroastrian Trust Funds of Europe37395I am grateful to the library staff of the University of Toronto, who have a microfilmof the archive, for allowing me to consult the archive in Cambridge.

It isinevitable that on such an occasion Bhownaggree would havespoken well of Naoroji, but the tone of his speech seemed that of someone who sincerely admired and liked him. He said:‘Throughout all his [Naoroji’s] long and eventful life there havebeen many eminent qualities of the head as well as the heart that have marked his career. His moderation has been proverbial...he has no enemy. His temperance of language,even when engaged in debates and discussions of a warm nature,has been remarkable.’101After the seven-year gap in the corres-pondence the two men continued to collaborate, but the tone ofthe letters became more formal and focused on the business inhand.

His grand-father was related to, and an important partner of, NusserwanjiTata, father of the famous J. N. who took the Saklatvalla familyinto his home in 1902. He turned the young Shapurji against hisown father and favoured him to the extent that his own son wasjealous, something which caused Saklatvalla problems later on.He studied at the Catholic St Xavier’s College, where the dis-ciplined life of the priests and nuns made a strong impression onhim. In the early years of the twentieth century he and somefriends worked with a bacteriologist, Prof. Vladimir Haffkine,immunizing Bombay’s poor against bubonic plague. Haffkine hadleft Russia to escape Tsarist surveillance, and it is reasonable tosuppose that his socialist views influenced Saklatvalla. After thisexperience he spent time depressed in a sanatorium. He joinedTatas in 1901, and in 1902 began prospecting for iron and coal inCentral India with Dorabji Tata and an American. In particularhe explored the area that was to become Jamshedpur, the centreof the Indian steel industry. He pursued this quest further thaneither of the Tatas did, sometimes to the detriment of his ownhealth in the jungles and swamps, sometimes in the face of dan-ger from lions and tigers, and to his own future career disadvant-age because of Dorabji’s increasing jealousy.

But it is well informed and readable. Although Wadsworth has no substantialadditional material compared with earlier studies, the collection of memories onSaklatvalla from his constituents, and other similar sources, make it a useful book. WhereasSaklatvalla was until recently the most neglected of the British Parsi politicians, he is nowthe most studied, although there is nothing academically equivalent to McLeod’s forth-coming book on Bhownaggree. The other two major works are M. J.

There he fell in love with a waitress at his hotel. A yearlater he married Elizabeth, known as Sally, and renamed bySaklatvalla as Seri. They had five children in what appears to havebeen a stable, if somewhat outwardly unaffectionate, marriage.Saklatvalla arrived in England a member of the Liberal Party; hemoved progressively to the Left through the Independent Labour tothe Communist Party. Wadsworth gives a good account of hisincreasing political activity, and the left-wing sympathies of theBattersea constituency, making intelligible what at first seems incred-ible, namely the election of an Indian Communist as a Member ofthe British Parliament (indeed he was the only Communist ever to beelected to Westminster). He lost his seat in 1923, but regained it a year later. His parliamentary years were full of events outsideParliament which merit discussion before an analysis of his parlia-mentary message.He undertook a visit to the Soviet Union, which influenced himdeeply, but was banned by the American authorities from a par-liamentary visit to the USA. He was a prominent figure during theminers’ and the General Strike. In 1926 he was imprisoned fortwo months because in a speech in Trafalgar Square he called forthe soldiers not to take up arms against the unarmed strikers.When he appeared in court he refused to be bound over, and sowas sent to prison. Throughout much of his life, especially afterhis release from prison, he was subject to police surveillance, andthe intelligence services opened his mail. Even though his rallieshad never been associated with violence, the police often can-celled his speeches at the last minute, when it was too late to makealternative arrangements, as a means of preventing him address-ing the electors.In 1927, after considerable protests against prevarication by theGovernment (involving an appeal to the Prime Minister) he wasallowed to visit his homeland, India.

Headdressed large audiences in many cities. His relations with theINC leadership were mixed. Generally, Nehru was willing toattend his lectures, and on Saklatavalla’s death sent a message tothe funeral. Relations with Gandhi were much more strained.Saklatvalla was hostile to Gandhi’s negative views on Indianindustrialization. Gandhi’s spinning wheel did not, in Saklatvalla’sopinion, satisfy the economic needs of the workers, and heobjected to the way that Gandhi allowed himself to be venerated.Gandhi had little sympathy for Saklatvalla’s Marxist views. Yet myimpression is that much of the tension was due to a personalityclash. After they eventually met at Gandhi’s ashram, Saklatvalladespaired of the possibility of building bridges, and publishedtheir correspondence.106Opposition to Gandhi, especially in pub-lic, was something the INC, and probably Gandhi himself, did nottolerate, as a Bombay Parsi was to find in the 1930s.107What isalso interesting in the context of this book are the different reac-tions of the Parsis in India to Saklatvalla. In Bombay the reactionsof the community leaders were polarized. For example, at a meet-ing of the Bombay Corporation, Sir Dinshah Petit, H. P. Mody,Byramji Jijibhoy, J. B. Petit and the Hon’ble Sir Pheroze Sethnaopposed the presentation of an address to Saklatvalla on his visitto the city, whereas four other Parsis (including F. K. Nariman)supported such a presentation.108At a meeting in Navsari,Saklatvalla was given the freedom of the city, and was honouredby the senior of the Dasturs, Dastur Meherjirana.Perhaps symbolic of the impact of this visit on Saklatvalla him-self was that at the Navsari function he wore traditional Parsidress. Contact with his family, and other Parsis, seems to havestirred his sense of Parsi identity. On his return from India he wasmoved to renew contacts with the Association. He had attendedmeetings previously, but, following clashes with Bhownaggree, heappears to have withdrawn. Now he sought agreement for the ini-tiation of his children.

Later the sameyear, 1927, the Association also gave permission for him and hischildren (but not his wife) to be buried at Brookwood.109Perhaps themost moving renewal of contact was with Bhownaggree.Saklatvalla wrote to Bhownaggree during an (unsuccessful) electioncampaign in Glasgow in 1930:My politics and standards of fights are otherwise at pole’s end fromyours, yet there are several factors that often make me think of you.When you first started breaking the Indian superstition that all Liberalsare really liberal and all Conservatives were cruel you were consideredto be the only ‘fool among all wise men’!

What aleg-pulling all round! Or is it the case of Birds of the same feather?When in between my whirlwind campaign work I give thoughts to thesethings, I think of you.In his concluding sentence, Saklatvalla adds that he realizes that‘in word and spirit my politics will be unacceptable to you’.Bhownaggree responded, expressing his appreciation ofSaklatvalla’s letter during a busy election campaign.The couple of generations that have elapsed since my notions of menand matters political were taking shape, have not shaken the founda-tions of my beliefs; and as I have never cared to shift them in accor-dance with popular, that is mob, moods, I have been content to look onwhile groups of favourite leaders have enjoyed their transient day offame, and passed into oblivion or been surpassed by others of theirkind, feeling firm in the faith that I, or rather my beliefs, (for it is not per-sons, but principles that live) shall be in some remote future justifiedof...[writing unclear] I have seen your election literature.

The Party praised him more on hisdeath than in his later years, when they had on occasion publiclyreprimanded him, for example for engaging in the ‘superstition’ ofhis children’s initiation.Saklatvalla’s parliamentary messageIt is more difficult to give a brief, focused account of Saklatvalla’sparliamentary campaigns, in comparison with those of the othertwo MPs, because he ranged so widely in terms both of subjectmatter and of (inter)national vision, even within the confines of asingle speech. His maiden speech (23 November 1922) illustratesthe general pattern. He started with unemployment and its causes,for example investment in jute mills in Bengal, which paid sub-stantially lower wages than in Britain, thus impoverishing Indianworkers and making British workers unemployed. He also alludedto the problems of India and Dundee. The cult of private enter-prise, he said, was enriching the political bosses and ruining theworkers. He then attacked the principle of one nation dictatingthe governmental structures of another, condemning the Britishfor what they had done in Ireland, India, Egypt andMesopotamia. He strongly criticized the Government’s record onthe treatment of minorities, particularly Catholics in Westminster,minorities in Armenia and Mesopotamia, and the unemployed inBritain. He objected to the Irish Treaty and said Britain shouldensure justice both in Ireland and South Africa.

Lengthy circuitous speeches such as his maidenspeech are difficult to categorize. However, they illustrateSaklatvalla’s international perspective, the range of his interestsand the changing emphases of his parliamentary contributionaccording to unfolding political events. He was not as focused onany one issue as Naoroji was on his ‘drain theory’. Saklatvala spokemostly on Ireland in 1923 when the Irish Treaty was beingeffected. In 1924–5 he paid most attention to the build-up of thearmed and special reserve forces as social unrest grew. In 1926 hewas concerned mostly with the General Strike, and after his visit toIndia in 1927 that country was a major subject for him. The twobroad areas which concerned him were (a) social issues, mainly inBritain; (b) imperialism in general and British imperialism in par-ticular. In Britain, he argued, there was no real justice: society wasrun in the interests of the ruling not the working class, even thoughit was the latter that generated the wealth. He campaigned forThe Zoroastrian Trust Funds of Europe381"},{"pageNumber":401,"pageContent":"various disadvantaged groups, for example the wives and childrenof criminals, pensions and better health insurance for the workers.For Saklatvalla the armed forces were one of his concerns for socialwelfare because they were deployed for the wealthy landowneragainst the masses of the poor at the time of the General Strike.He did not call for violence from the workers, but he did appeal tothe soldiers ‘not to kill us and not to shoot the workers’.110Even more fundamentally he questioned the purpose of thearmed forces in general. They were not deployed to safeguardfood supplies, as Government claimed, but for imperial power; so,for example, he pointed out that Britain did not import food fromChina but maintained a substantial armed presence in the region.Although there was famine in Ireland the air force did not takefood supplies. He saw injustice at the centre of British policy. Heargued, for example, that Britain would not co-operate withRussian rule because of bloodshed during the revolution, yet theEmpire was founded on bloodshed.This country has shed a hundred times more blood of people of allnations in the world. You have slaughtered Frenchmen, Spaniards,Dutch and Russians, you have slaughtered Turks, Persians andAfghans...You killed in their own homes the Punjabis, Bengalis andthe Mahrattas, and the Ceylonese, the Burmese, the Malayans and theChinese. You murdered poor, primitive races, people who did not knowthe geography of where your country was situated as the Sudanese, theZulus, the Bantus and the Swazis and you had not the remotest excusethat they were going to attack and kill you. You have butchered themand murdered them in a wholesale manner. You have killed them intheir own country. There is no nation in the world...which hasdevoured more human lives and created more murders than the Britishnation and the British Parliament.111He attacked the principle of the Simon Commission in India,questioning the right of one nation to impose a constitution onanother thousands of miles away, and pointing out that the Britishwould not accept that for themselves from the Chinese. He furtherargued that Britain imposed one set of criteria on parts of theEmpire run by Whites, and different ones for non-White coun-tries. He protested that although Trade Unions were legal inBritain, they were not in India.

In Parliament he was totally ignored. The Speakeroften prevented him from speaking, other MPs ignored ratherthan disputed with him, as did Government. There was nothingcomparable to Naoroji’s Royal Commission, nor the variety ofsmall ways in which McLeod has shown that Bhownaggree had aneffect on the Government. It is not easy to establish that he hadmuch impact on the Communist Party, partly because we do notknow what in his parliamentary message was his own and what waswritten for him by the Party (for it is clear that his speeches werewritten for him). We cannot compare his speeches in Parliamentwith those outside, because he then spoke extempore so that thereare no notes and few records. The most that he appears to havedone is to put Asia in general, and India in particular, on theCommunist Party agenda.112As a person he emerges from Zoroastrian House records as aconciliator. He approached the Association for his children’s initi-ations and was the first to seek reconciliation with Bhownaggreein the 1920s; and it was Saklatvalla who took the initiative andwrote to Bhownaggree during his Glasgow campaign. Althoughhe and Gandhi did not have good relations, and there was muchabout Congress which he objected to, nevertheless on the lastspeech of his Indian tour he called publicly for people to unitebehind Congress, as the only body likely to achieve Independencefor India. His parliamentary speeches were blunt, but his mannerwas always courteous and he was meticulous in his observation ofparliamentary etiquette. All writers and reports of his speechesrefer to him as charismatic, but that is not the impression gainedfrom reading parliamentary records, which suggest that his out-side speeches were less tightly controlled than his parliamentarywork. He therefore remains something of an enigma.The Zoroastrian Trust Funds of Europe383112M. Squires,Saklatvala: A Political Biography, London,1990. pp. 143–55."},{"pageNumber":403,"pageContent":"Conclusions on British Parsis in politicsThe overriding impression of the various Parsi politicians, espe-cially those in Parliament, is that they were different. There is nosingle ‘Parsi voice’ or political perspective. Each of them wassomething of an idealist, though their ideals were not the same.Both Naoroji and Bhownaggree, in Parliament, sought to reform,not remove, British rule. The analysis of the problem and theirproposed solutions were different. Naoroji’s focus on the drain ofresources through tax and through British officials sending moneyback to England caused him to argue for a change in the taxagenda—India should not pay for causes other than her own, andin this he and Bhownaggree agreed. But whereas Naoroji therebyemphasized keeping the tax bill down wherever possible, forexample, by not building railways, Bhownaggree argued forgreater investment in Indian technology and industry to give thecountry financial stability. Saklatvalla was the only one to call inParliament for the removal of British rule. The three MPs do notappear to have been particularly friendly at Zoroastrian House( Wadsworth refers to Saklatvalla bringing his friends to disruptmeetings chaired by Bhownaggree), yet mostly they appear tohave collaborated. There is little evidence that any of them usedtheir political position for Parsi communal interests, save only inpetitions to the Shah on behalf of Iranian Zoroastrians; Naorojiand Bhownaggree brought leading figures to Zoroastrian func-tions partly to give an impression of a high-class society. In par-liamentary affairs at least, they were, as Naoroji and PherozeshahMehta both said, Indians first and Parsis second. BothBhownaggree and Saklatvalla, especially on their India tours,worked more closely with Muslim leaders than with the INC.The one to have the best personal relations with Gandhi wasBhownaggree, at least until 1909, through his South Africa cam-paign, though one suspects that at a distance Gandhi respectedNaoroji. Each of them was an ardent campaigner for what hebelieved to be just, though each differed in his perception of whatconstituted justice. Naoroji’s central claim was for justice for India,as was Bhownaggree’s. The latter remained of the opinion that itwas in India’s interests to remain under British rule, but that thatrule needed to change, regarding tax, education and especially thedefence of Indians’ rights in the colony of South Africa.Saklatvalla sought the rights of workers worldwide, but especiallyThe Zoroastrian Trust Funds of Europe384"},{"pageNumber":404,"pageContent":"in India and Britain. Each of them displayed courage in standingby what he believed in: Naoroji in the face of lengthy battles tooppose his candidature; Bhownaggree in standing against the sus-tained onslaught of INC leaders, notably Wacha; and Saklatvallain choosing prison rather than withdraw his plea to the soldiersnot to fire on unarmed strikers. Indeed, it is thought that had hebeen prepared to tone down his message, and to accept theLabour whip, he could have become Under Secretary of State forIndia. (It may also have been the case that had Bhownaggreetoned down his criticisms, he could have gained a higher positionin the Tory Party.) They were all in their different ways principledfighters for what they believed was justice for India; theirZoroastrian upbringing taught them to attack evil and defend thegood, wherever they saw it.Religion among British ZoroastriansThe British community has not experienced the extensive debatesover religious matters that will be seen to occur in America, or inMumbai. But inevitably there have been some. Perhaps the mostcommon debate in Britain relates to community boundaries,specifically the place of non-Zoroastrians at key rituals and places.Early in Naoroji’s presidency there was a debate over whether non-Zoroastrians could attend a Zoroastrian funeral. This resurfaced asa major issue in the 1970s and 1980s when the non-Zoroastrianspouse of a deceased member was asked to leave the bungliduringthe annual death ceremony. This some found particularly hurtfulbecause the deceased had been a prominent and respected leader;his widow also had been a stalwart supporter of the Association.This was the tip of an iceberg, for there was unease in some quar-ters that non-Zoroastrians had been welcomed into the prayerroom, and given prominent positions at jashans. One important fac-tor in the reassertion of traditional boundaries, based on the puritylaws, was the growing influence of Parsis from Aden and EastAfrica, for in Africa they had preserved the values and ways of anearlier period in Indian belief and practice. Several scholars haveargued that East African Asians, be they Hindus or Sikhs, are moreorthodox than their co-religionists who migrated directly fromIndia. This view was explicitly argued by a priest and president ofThe Zoroastrian Trust Funds of Europe385"},{"pageNumber":405,"pageContent":"ZTFE, Darius Sethna, in Parsiana(November 1968): ‘The structureof the Zoroastrian community in the UK has now changed. Whileformerly the community [was] composed of the Bombay andKarachi Parsis...today the majority is from Mombasa, Kenya,Uganda, Zambia and Aden. They are all very conservativeminded.’ Some of them felt strongly that the earlier settlers hadbecome too liberal in their willingness to assimilate. The conflictwas therefore focused on appropriate practices, but there was alsoa personality conflict, especially in the 1980s.From the 1980s there was a greater desire to develop a religiouseducation programme and there was wide support for bringingKhojeste Mistree from India to run intensive and extended work-shops especially for the young people. His impact was important.In very general terms, a significant proportion of the more ‘liberal’wing moved with the WZO, leaving the ZTFE a more traditionalbody. It would be easy to exaggerate this statement, because somepeople were members of both, despite the intensity of the conflictbetween the respected leaders, but there is some truth in theassertion.It is possible to give a general picture of the place of religionamong British Zoroastrians in the mid-1980s because, in additionto the international survey, a supplementary questionnaire was sentonly to British Zoroastrians, and Manchester University alsofunded a research assistant, Dr Rashna Writer, for one year, to con-duct 232 structured, in-depth interviews. The collection ofresearch data for the picture of Zoroastrianism in Britain in the1980s is greater than for the communities in other chapters. Thedetails have been published in Zoroastrians in Britain, and RashnaWriter has also published her reflections.113The resultant picturemerits further consideration over a decade later. Although thereare regional Associations and informal groups in different Britishcities, as discussed above, the Zoroastrian population of Britain isbased predominantly in London, in three particular areas: Harrowand Wembley to the north-west and Wimbledon in the south. InBritain, as in other countries studied, there is a different patternbetween the scattered groups and those living in a centre. The for-mer tend to intermarry more, they have even higher rates of edu-cation and career success. They tend to observe their religiousThe Zoroastrian Trust Funds of Europe386113Contemporary Zoroastrians, pp. 224–37."},{"pageNumber":406,"pageContent":"practices less frequently, and for obvious reasons tend to be in lessfrequent contact with fellow Zoroastrians.The first point to note is the high level of awareness and asser-tion of Zoroastrian identity: 85% of elders and 75% of youth sur-veyed described themselves as practising Zoroastrians, and eventhose who did not, generally asserted that Zoroastrianism was apart of their identity. Writer has shown that sense of identity to becomplex and shifting between being British, Indian/Pakistani/Iranian, etc. and being the ‘real Persians’. Another group sawthemselves as British or felt close to India. There was a preferencefor asserting Persian, not Iranian, identity, for this reinforced thebond with the ancient heritage, not with the modern political state.For a substantial proportion of informants, being identified as‘Asian’ was offensive. For them it is an alien, meaningless, extern-ally imposed label, ignoring their historic ancestry.The language patterns are less complex. Iranians preserve theirFarsi, even among the younger generation for whom English is partof daily life. Gujarati is much less common among Parsis, espe-cially written Gujarati. For the older generation particularly,Gujarati may be the language of family conversation, and humour(the traditional natakis still enjoyed by many), but the language ofbusiness, of theorizing and policy-making, is commonly English,the language of virtually all their twentieth century records. At fest-ive occasions, in general conversation, it is not uncommon toswitch between languages within a sentence. For most of theyounger generation, including those in close contact with the oldcountry, English is the medium of communication at all times.In conversation, most of my informants who were not born inBritain said that they believed that they had become more religiousafter migration than they were before. The people who are mostcommonly religiously active are retired people, housewives, thosewho did not go to university (especially if their schooling was in the old country), those who continue to think in their mother tongue,those who visit Zoroastrian House regularly and who return to theold country more often, those who have migrated recently, peoplefrom rural Gujarat (as opposed to cosmopolitan Mumbai), from EastAfrica, and those who have children. The converse is also true to acertain extent: those who express less commitment to the faith arethe youth, single people, people born in Britain, those with a highlevel of educational and career success, those who do not attendThe Zoroastrian Trust Funds of Europe387"},{"pageNumber":407,"pageContent":"Zoroastrian House and who do not intend to return to the old coun-try. But the picture is more complex than that simple polarizationmight suggest. A higher percentage of Zoroastrian youth affirmtheir religious identity and follow traditional practice than is com-mon in wider British society. When they are involved in their reli-gion, then both Writer and myself found that they are commonlymore traditional than their elders, in terms of attitudes to the oldcountry, the place of non-Zoroastrians at Zoroastrian House and, inone sense, their attitude to intermarriage. Although most accept thatthe numbers of intermarrieds will grow, and they commonly assertthat they would accept the spouses, there is nevertheless a high pro-portion saying that the ideal is in-marriage. A number of informantsasserted that if they could not find a Zoroastrian partner, they wouldchoose not to get married, partly because of the communal hassle,partly because of the difficulty over the religious and cultural ident-ity of any offspring. Although a number look at the adverts for part-ners, few have been comfortable with the idea of visits back to theold country in a quest for a spouse, and my own anecdotal evidencefrom knowing a number of young people is that many do delay mar-riage beyond what is common even for Parsis in their wish to find aZoroastrian partner, and some never do. My informants, however,tell me that in the late 1990s there is a growing willingness to con-sider spouses from the old country as the quest for their roots grows.In the late 1980s and early 1990s, there was an evident increase inthe number of young people participating not just in social events,but also in religious classes, some for example run by Rashna Writeron behalf of London University Extra Mural Department, atZoroastrian House, and seminars run by Khojeste Mistree. As notedinZoroastrians in Britain, there was a much higher level of religiousactivity in general, especially with youth participation, in the early1990s than was observable when I first started going to ZoroastrianHouse in the early 1970s.There is another general pattern: young people tend to be reli-gious after the manner, and to the level, of their parents until theyleave home, generally for university, when they drift from the tradi-tion, until they get married; when this is to a Zoroastrian, and thenwhen they have children, they become active in the religion. For thegreat majority of people who identify themselves as ‘Zoroastrian’,the term denotes not simply a set of privately held beliefs, but ratherindicates a communal allegiance, a historic identity, not mere groupThe Zoroastrian Trust Funds of Europe388"},{"pageNumber":408,"pageContent":"membership, but a blood, genetic or racial lineage. Their religion istied in with their history as a tiny persecuted minority, but also asthe inheritors of one of the great historic civilizations which influ-enced not only Greece and Rome, but also Judaism, Christianityand Islam. In the words of some of my informants: ‘[we are] car-rying on a long tradition. You feel, being so few in numbers, it isquite a precious thing. It is rare for people to belong to such a smallgroup and not to have a sense of heritage.’ Another commented ‘I feel very proud that it is the oldest religion.’ And a non-practisingZoroastrian commented: ‘It is part of me, it is my past. Even thoughI may not be practising, it is a part of my history and I am proud ofit.’ Whatever their personal beliefs about such cosmological ideas aslife after death, few members of the community would want to setthemselves apart from this communal allegiance, be they elders oryoung people.In view of this communal perspective, it is important to discusshow Zoroastrians see themselves in relation to other communities.Their general attitude to the British is interesting, especially inview of the traditional Parsi views on their relationship with theBritish. Of the elders of the community, 84% said that they werenot impressed by British youth and would not want their ownyoungsters to grow up like their peers in wider society. The mostcommon words used to describe the British were ‘cold’, ‘distant’,‘unreliable’, ‘patronizing’, ‘do not trust them’. There was a fairlywidespread belief that the British are more sexually promiscuousthan Zoroastrians, that they neglect family responsibilities and donot care for their elders as they should. A majority also said that itis difficult to have a close friendship with British people. In hisfinal address at the 2000 AGM, a retiring trustee, Cawas Sethnasaid that: ‘In this country we can fortunately embrace and adoptsome of the good points of the British way of life which we of theolder generation lived with in India...However, I think we shouldNOT pick up some of the adverse aspects of life for example, someaspects of family life among the working classes with high divorcerates.’Another important aspect of the Zoroastrian perspective on theBritish is their perception of facing racial prejudice. The supple-mentary questionnaire sent out in Britain focused particularly on this subject, which was followed up in the in-depth interviews.In global terms, the community where the highest number ofThe Zoroastrian Trust Funds of Europe389"},{"pageNumber":409,"pageContent":"respondents said that they faced discrimination was Toronto (48%of respondents). But in follow-up questions respondents indicatedthat this was not frequent or substantial and that it was most com-monly experienced in obtaining one’s first job. However, myinformants told me, once you were in a post you were judged onability, not race. In London, 42% of respondents commented thatthey had faced discrimination, 39% frequently (cf. 23% in Toronto).Furthermore, it was discerned in a number of areas, not only inemployment, but particularly in schools (from peers, teachers andthe curriculum), housing and the police. A survey like this cannotestablish that there was in fact prejudice, since I was not presentwhen such incidents occurred: it can only record people’s percep-tions. However, my own belief is that my figures underestimatethe frequency, because several respondents and interviewees saidthat they had not faced racial discrimination, but later com-mented that they had experienced ‘Paki-bashing’. Childrenreported in private that they had not told their parents of prob-lems because they did not want to worry them. When the statisticsfor those who believe they have, and those who believe that theyhave not, faced discrimination are compared it is possible to iden-tify certain groups (not) having this perception. The groups whobelieve that they have faced discrimination are, most commonly,housewives, retired persons and elders, those who have arrivedrecently, and those born in Britain, people with children ratherthan singles, people who continue to think in an Asian language,people who did not go to university. It was also these groups whoemphasized that race is a part of religion, especially East Africans.In Appendix 2, Table 1: 35–7 and the three notes following high-light the fact that fewer British Zoroastrians, especially those inLondon, considered their relations with the wider population to beexcellent or good, than in almost any other centre studied. More ofthem than anywhere else considered that they faced discriminationat work, in housing and in education and more of them said thatdiscrimination was on the basis of colour. The international per-spective will be discussed further in Chapter 10 in the section on theglobal survery.In view of the perception of racial prejudice, respondents andinterviewees were asked what they considered to be the greatestthreats to their community in Britain. The biggest perceived threatwas not racial prejudice but the impact of British social values onThe Zoroastrian Trust Funds of Europe390"},{"pageNumber":410,"pageContent":"the family, although the younger generation did see racial discrim-ination as the greatest threat. But despite these perceived threats,two-thirds of Zoroastrians said that they had close Anglo-Saxonfriends, especially those with a higher education and those withsuccessful careers. The majority of respondents (57%) thought thatthey had excellent relations with wider British society. In the sup-plement distributed only in Britain (498 responses) Zoroastriansasserted that they considered themselves to be equal with Europeansand superior to other religious and racial groups, Muslims, Hindus,other Asians and Black Africans. At different points in the ques-tionnaire and interviews, questions were asked about their sense of identity. Mostly, the elders and early settlers defined themselvesin terms of the old country; those born in the West described themselves mainly as British; but all groups preferred to identifythemselves as Zoroastrians. In the 1970s, scholars writing aboutmigrant groups used the idea of being caught between cultures,though by the 1990s this was being questioned on the grounds thatsuch a concept presumed clear and exclusive boundaries to cul-tures. At least in the 1980s, when this survey and the interviewswere conducted, this vocabulary had become reasonably commonparlance and people were asked if they considered themselves thuscaught. Less than half the interviewees felt caught in this way. Thepeople who did tended to be the young, those who had recentlymigrated, those born here or whose higher education was inBritain, single rather than married persons, and those whoattended Zoroastrian House infrequently. The pattern appeared tobe that those who felt strongly Zoroastrian, or strongly British, didnot feel caught, but people who were unsure of their identity did.It is worth quoting some of the actual words of interviewees. AKarachi-born Zoroastrian said: ‘I am not totally British in attitudeand thinking. But when I go to Pakistan I don’t understand theireveryday life, then I am stuck in limbo. I ask myself “where do Ibelong?” ’ A 34-year-old lady said: ‘My mind says I should behavelike a Zoroastrian, but my body says western. I feel a Zoroastrianbut I have western attitudes.’ A teenage girl brought together anumber of themes discussed: ‘When I started feeling that way[caught between two cultures] I was frightened. I thought I was los-ing a grip on what I was. So I studied my religion and culture. NowI have no hesitancy at all in saying what I am. I am comfortablebeing a Zoroastrian in Britain. I would be comfortable being The Zoroastrian Trust Funds of Europe391"},{"pageNumber":411,"pageContent":"a Zoroastrian anywhere, even in Outer Mongolia.’ But another 17-year-old Parsi said: ‘We have no home really. We feel foreignwherever we are, foreign in India, foreign in Britain. Where do I belong? I don’t belong in Britain; I don’t belong in India.’ Itwould be wrong to give a picture of a community at a loss for itsidentity, but there are some, approximately one-third of respond-ents, who were hesitant about it, or in the language of one inter-viewee, about the different parts of their persona. In Chapter 1there was a summary of the debate between Ballard, Vertovec and others concerning the perception of South Asians in Britainbeing caught between cultures, or skilled cultural navigators.The evidence from this study is that it is not a question of either/or,but rather of ‘both...and’. The Zoroastrian community is not amonolithic whole, but a vibrant group within which there are a range of personalities, experiences and reactions to Britishsociety.British Zoroastrians at the Turn of the MillenniumThe picture that it was possible to paint when I wrote Zoroastriansin Britain(1994) was cautiously optimistic. The number of festivalscelebrated was increasing, especially the gahambars. The numbersattending major functions were growing, the priests reportedincreasing numbers of families asking for religious functions in thehome, for example jashansand purification rites after childbirthwere being increasingly observed. Childrens’ education classesand weekly prayer classes for children ofnaujoteage flourishedmore than ever before. Community (hambandagi) prayers wererecited before most functions, including secular lectures; the num-ber of visiting religious leaders, notably the Dasturs, had begun toincrease. What has happened since the writing of this optimisticaccount?Religious practice in the new millenniumIn the conclusion to Zoroastrians in BritainI commented on theincrease of religious practice from the 1960s to 1995 (the year I finished writing that book). Since then the level of religious activ-ity has increased further. In the year 2000–1 thirty-five jashanswere performed, including the times of all the festivals and the The Zoroastrian Trust Funds of Europe392"},{"pageNumber":412,"pageContent":"tenmuktaddays according to both the main Parsi calendar(Shahenshai) and following the Iranian calendar, and the uthumnaorsirozaprayers for the souls of departed patrons. There are eighteenpractising mobeds, so it has become possible to hold all theseceremonies, even if the festival occurs during the working week.Each such religious function is followed by a social event, andmeals on most occasions are sponsored by philanthropists, or afamily in memory of a deceased family member. There have beenfurther courses on Zoroastrianism led by Khojeste Mistree and aswe shall see below, there have been many more visits by leadingpriestly figures from India than any other Association. Of all thediaspora communities, ZTFE is probably closer emotionally toIndia than any except perhaps Hong Kong. Although there are noprecise figures to prove it, it is my strong impression that the fre-quency of visits back to the old country is increasing. Those of uswho were involved in race-relations work back in the 1960s gen-erally assumed that the level of religious practice would diminishas migrants assimilated; that assumption is clearly wrong. Tounderline how different this was in comparison with earlier years,the Annual Report for 1935 noted only one religious function inthe whole year, and that was organized because an Indian priestwas passing through London. At the 1938 AGM it was resolved totry and hold two jashansper annum. One factor in the increasedreligious activity is that the size of the community has increased,but it also arises from a concern to make ZTFE not simply an ‘oldfashioned gentleman’s club’, and a clear recognition of the factthat it is the religion which gives the community its identity.The commitment to the study of Zoroastrianism is also a dis-tinctive feature of ZTFE. This was part of the original Trusts’objectives in 1861 and has been pursued with particular determina-tion at the end of the millennium in two ways in particular. First,ZTFE has probably the largest library of books on Zoroastrianismof any western diaspora group. At the Houston World(Millennium) Congress in 2000, ZTFE organized and paid for abook exhibition and sale which they claim, probably correctly, wasthe largest ever mounted for the community.114Books onZoroastrianism, mostly brought over from India, are on regularThe Zoroastrian Trust Funds of Europe393114See A.

Second, ZTFE maintains closelinks with the academic world. Western scholars are often calledupon to give lectures, and their books on the religion are sometimeslaunched at functions in Zoroastrian House. The School ofOriental and African Studies in London University has created thefirst post ever tied to Zoroastrian Studies; hitherto Zoroastrianspecialists have been placed either in Comparative Religion, orMiddle Eastern language or archaeology departments. This hasbeen possible because of two anonymous bequests, a substantialdonation from Mehraban Zartoshty, and support from SOAS.Zoroastrians have attended some of the courses and Zoroastrianpostgraduates have been given financial support for their studies.SOAS has also hosted an annual lecture in memory of the lateDastur Kutar, with funds obtained through the good offices ofWZO (discussed further in Chapter 10 below). As we shall see inthe chapter on America, the practice of inviting outside westernscholars to address the Associations has declined there. That hasnot happened in Britain. ZTFE has not, however, neglected thescholarship of its own members; in addition to the increasing num-ber of invitations to religious leaders, they have also funded thescholarly studies of people from India, notably a research visit toCambridge to work on liturgical texts by Dastur Dr FirozeKotwal.115An important religious development in Britain has beenthe engagement with inter-faith activities.Inter-faith activitiesThere has been an evident, deliberate and explicitly articulatedincrease in the Zoroastrian involvement in inter-faith activity. Thecauses and consequences merit discussion. In the 1970s and 1980srequests from universities, schools and other similar educationalgroups were responded to positively. Especially in the 1970sspouses of intermarrieds were accepted, so there was no antagon-ism towards external groups. But there was relatively little con-scious inter-religious activity. However, two episodes in particularraised concerns about the projection of the image of the religion.The Sunday newspaper the Observerran a colour supplement withan A–Z on cults, and included Zoroastrianism.

Partly they fearedfor their external image, and partly they were concerned at whatimpression of their heritage this would give their children.Community leaders and interested academics protested to thepaper about the offensiveness of this historically ludicrous listing,but the only response I saw simply said ‘we needed something for “Z.” ’ There was no concern for the people offended. Theproblem with being such a small community is that outsiders donot trouble about causing distress. The equivalent insult wouldnot have been levelled at British Muslims. There was a similar butunrelated episode in June 1994. His Royal Highness the Prince ofWales said in a television programme that he wanted his tradi-tional role as Defender of the [Anglican] Faith to becomeDefender of Faiths, be they Roman Catholicism, Judaism, Islamor Zoroastrianism. Few viewers knew who the Zoroastrians were.In the capital city’s main evening newspaper, the London EveningStandardof 27 July there was an article on the royal statementwhich all the Zoroastrians I know found offensive: ‘the notion ofCharles being defender of faith...strikes me as bizarre. Takethose Zoroastrians...’;the report goes on to describe them asworshipping ‘an evil god’; it alludes to them leaving the dead ‘tobe devoured in Towers of Silence by rats’; it states that theMuslims view Zoroastrians as idolaters and in the last paragraphrefers to ‘the ceremony being conducted in the various dead lan-guages favoured by the Zoroastrians’. The mocking tone, the put-downs, inaccuracies (the writer did not say what Muslims havesaid of Christians!), all display the vulnerability of such a smallgroup to journalistic ridicule and media insensitivity.The community has responded quietly in diverse ways. In partit has taken every opportunity to publicize its achievements,notably the centenary of Naoroji’s entry to Parliament when threebooks were published, a formal dinner was held in Parliament, andfunctions were mounted at the Indian High Commission.Something similar was done, though on a smaller scale, forBhownaggree’s centenary. Those in the royal honours list arepublicized. The inter-faith activities have various merits:for Zoroastrians one is the way in which they themselves arerepresented—validly—as followers of one of the great religions ofhistory.

The event was co-hosted by ZTFE and AmnestyInternational, and like traditional Zoroastrian gatherings, endedwith a festive meal. Zoroastrians have participated in, and con-tributed prayers to, United Nations Day for World Peace, andErvad Bhedwar offered prayers at the prayerful reunion called bythe late Cardinal Hulme in Westminster Cathedral.116Throughsuch connections the president of ZTFE, has been invited to royalgarden parties at Buckingham Palace117and to multi-faith discus-sions on racism and religious education at Lambeth Palace, theofficial home of the Archbishop of Canterbury, the senior clericin the global Anglican Communion.118In 1994 and again in 2000a ‘Pilgrimage March’ around London ended at ZoroastrianHouse with a warm welcome and reception.119In the same yearZTFE participated at book launches with Prince Philip at St James’s Palace,120and in the International World Congress onReligion and Peace in Riva Del Garda near Verona. There,‘Ervad Sethna [from London] lit the fire with Zoroastrian prayersto inaugurate the conference, and all the other faiths lit their can-dles individually from the main fire which was kept burning for 21 days.’121An event that the community believes to be significant is the inclusion of Zoroastrianism as one of the nine religionsrepresented in the Faith Zone of the Millennium Dome.

These and other similar events have triggered radio pro-grammes, and better informed newspaper articles, when journalistshave attended a ceremony and encountered the Zoroastrian com-munity spirit for themselves. People who have met the communitydo not write the sort of offensive nonsense quoted above. Anotherhigh-profile development occurred when the then Indian HighCommissioner, H. E. Dr Singhvi, hosted a No Ruz celebration athis official residence in March 1996, with prominent figures fromthe Hindu community (the Hinduja brothers) and the IranianConsul General.123In 1999, the new High Commissioner, LalitMann Singh, hosted the event at India House. The Newsletterreported that Sanjay Gandhi’s widow, who had produced a book onZoroastrian names, attended and asserted that her late husband hadwished to bring their children up as Zoroastrians.124The thinking behind ZTFE involvement in these activities hasbeen articulated in various Newslettersand president’s reports. It isworth quoting some of them to highlight the motivation involved.The appeal to members to join the Peace Pilgrimage referred to above read: ‘[ This is a] unique opportunity to spend timetogether as people of faith, witnessing to the values of peace andinterfaith understanding and exploring the world of different faithtraditions.’125Another Annual Report noted:Significant Zoroastrian participation has been evident in many multi-faith activities held all over London and elsewhere, creating the desiredawareness of the presence of Zoroastrians in the country. Reference toZoroastrians has begun to be included in multifaith publications, mostnotably our inclusion in the ‘Multi Faith Directory of Great Britain’.The report then goes on to record that invitations to leaders ofother religions to visit Zoroastrian House have resulted in reci-procal invitations to attend ‘other religious and non-religious pub-lic, intercommunal, governmental and national events.’126Inter-faith activity is seen as a long-term commitment, so in oneThe Zoroastrian Trust Funds of Europe397122See the Annual Report for 1999–2000 and Newsletter, 11 May 1999.123Newsletter, 22 Apr. 1997, pp. 2 f.124Newsletter, 11 May 1999.125Quarterly circular, Apr. 1994, p. 3.

On another occasion the Newslettercommented: ‘The ZTFEacknowledges the untiring and selfless work of the Inter FaithNetwork and of our representatives to the IFN. It is through suchparticipation that Zoroastrianism has now been recognised as oneof the 9 major religions in the UK.’128In the Annual Report for theyear 1999–2000, the president commented that ‘Participation inInter-Faith activities has been a new but important feature of theAssociation’s work in the last 10 years.’ This has helped to raise theprofile of Zoroastrianism in the community at large. In someZoroastrian communities, for example in America, I have beentold that inter-faith work is starting to be questioned on thegrounds that it leads to influence upon, or changes within,Zoroastrian practice as common denominators are sought forfunctions. Some have said that having people from other religionspresent at your ritual changes the atmosphere. But I have notheard that said among ZTFE members. One reason for the wide-spread acceptance of this activity, according to my informants, isthat it was started by one of the most traditional of recent presid-ents, Ervad Zal Sethna. Members feel that if someone of his posi-tion is comfortable with what is happening, then it must bereasonable. Such involvement has also been sanctioned by therespected traditional Dasturs, JamaspAsa and Kotwal, who havealso taken part in similar events at international level. Anotherimportant factor has been the personal commitment of a respectedmember of ZTFE, Jehangir Sarosh. He attended the MillenniumSummit of World Religions for Peace at the United Nations andhas gained considerable respect in inter-faith circles beyond hisown community. He was elected the European chairman of theWorld Council of Religions for Peace and was then elected co-vice-chair of the Inter Faith Network for the UK.129The com-munity as a whole takes great pride in the prominence theirancient religion now has at major inter-religious functions.The Zoroastrian Trust Funds of Europe398127AGM Report, 1 Apr.–31 Mar. 1998, p. 3.128Newsletter, 7 Aug. 1998, p. 3.129The ZTFE Annual Report 2000–1, p. 11."},{"pageNumber":418,"pageContent":"One function, which many were able to enjoy, was the visit ofthe Earl of Wessex (the Queen’s youngest son) and his wife Sophie,Countess of Wessex, representing Her Majesty the Queen, at acommunal celebration of the fifty years of her reign in June 2002.In a friendly and happy atmosphere, traditional prayers affirmingcentral Zoroastrian values were recited and translated, the historyand achievements of the community were related and sincere affir-mations of communal loyalty to the crown were asserted.130The youth programmeThere has been a substantial youth programme throughout muchof the last decade, with events ranging from parties to attendanceat BBC recordings, badminton, cricket, skating, self-defenceclasses, and a youth pilgrimage to Iran. But the biggest event in thiscalendar was the staging of the Second World Zoroastrian YouthCongress in London, 4–11 July 1997, which was attended by 400 Zoroastrians, the majority (250) from overseas, indeed fromfifteen different countries (there was even a waiting list in case ofcancellations). Sponsors enabled the Young Zoroastrians (YZs) tocharge a congress fee low enough to allow youth from overseas toattend. For the first part of the week the Congress was held in alarge hotel, which became virtually an international Zoroastrianyouth village. The second half was based at Zoroastrian Housewith visitors staying in various Zoroastrian homes, spending thedaytime socializing and sightseeing, the evenings in workshops atZoroastrian House. The speakers provided an interesting balance.They included senior religious leaders from India, the two highpriests Dasturs K. M. JamaspAsa and F. M. Kotwal, Ervad Dr R.

There were also many papers from young Zoroastriansfrom around the world on what being a Zoroastrian meant to themat the end of the second millennium, with contributions from peo-ple both of Parsi and of Iranian descent. These included ShirazMistry, ‘A Zoroastrian in Australia’; a paper by Vishtasp MehrSoroushian from the USA on balancing peer and parental pressureand expectations while growing up as a Zoroastrian; and one byRashna Gadialy from the USA on what children in the Westshould be taught about their religion. There were some intensedebates on intermarriage and women priests. The social pro-gramme was naturally extensive: a grand ball, a variety show withtalent spots, two nataksput on by the youth a disco, and many infor-mal parties around the city. The event was organized by the YZsthemselves. It was a considerable operation, with a turnover of£110,00, 1,800 metres of fax paper used, fifteen-lever arch files ofcorrespondence, and 4,800 meals served. A small profit was madeto assistant the launch of the next World Youth Congress.131Thereports I have heard stressed above all the psychological import-ance of being made so aware of being part of a living religionspread over many countries, of living for a week in an internationalZoroastrian community. Young people who at school, university orwork are commonly the only Zoroastrians there, find considerablesupport from such opportunities to meet co-religionists fromaround the world who are also proud of their identity, and areoften wrestling with similar problems. There was deep pleasure insharing common values, or, as one person put it in one write-up‘letting our kusties hang out and not caring!’ In a real sense, thedancing to loud music in the bar and by the pool were as import-ant as the most powerful lecture. The chair of the organizingcommittee, Kerman Jasavala, was given the World Youth Award atthe Seventh World Zoroastrian Congress in Houston, for hisachievement in taking the lead role in the congress. The organiz-ing of the Congress brought many British Zoroastrians to worktogether as a team and to become much more involved inZoroastrian House than many of them had before. My informa-tion is that, without a major comparable event, some of thatintense collaborative activity has not found a subsequent outlet.The Zoroastrian Trust Funds of Europe400131An extensive report was published by A.

InOctober 1992 the ‘Zoroastrian House New Premises Fund’ wasstarted. In 1993 a booklet was produced by a steering committeeset up to guide the project entitled The Unimpeded March of theZoroastrian Spirit into the Twenty-first Century. It explains ( pp. 6 f.) thatthe numbers attending Zoroastrian House had increased becauseof the arrivals of ‘a lot’ of East African Parsis in the 1960s, theIranian Zoroastrians after the revolution, and the increasing inter-est of the youth. The idea at that time was to provide purpose-built premises. It also stated, ‘There is an undoubted desire,expressed by an overwhelming majority of our community, toenthrone the Holy Fire here, thus making the United Kingdomthe first place in the Western Hemisphere to experience an occa-sion of global uniqueness’ ( p. 8). Attendances already soared to600, and the Managing Committee’s view was that more wouldattend if there were larger and better facilities. Car parkingaround the present house was described as ‘a nightmare’, and the old Victorian building did not suit its purpose very well; forexample, the washing and toilet facilities were inadequate to meetthe needs of so many to wash before prayer, and the old buildingwas expensive to maintain. The committee also wished to establisha dadgah fire because they felt ‘that the members now want toestablish a more profound Zoroastrian religious base in the UnitedKingdom.... The creation of Dadgah and the consequentconsecration of the Holy Fire would be a step in the right directionto satisfy the newly acquired fervour amongst our youth.’ Theintention was to make the dadgah, with the associated mobed’saccommodation, for Zoroastrians only, but Zoroastrians and non-Zoroastrians could use the separate social structure. They said thatthey were looking for premises that could accommodate up to1,200 people, dining space for up to 400 people, good car park-ing space, and various recreation rooms and office spaces. Theoriginal plans also included a bunglifor funerals. The cost was estim-ated at £2.5 million to cover three phases: purchase of land,building, and fitting-out. The intention was to raise the capitalcosts from fundraising functions but especially from large donors.The Zoroastrian Trust Funds of Europe401"},{"pageNumber":421,"pageContent":"The funds from the sale of the existing house were to be investedand used for the maintenance of the new premises.The acquisition of new premises has caused difficulties in mostwestern diaspora groups. In order to avoid divisions, successivecommittees held Open Forums to brief members and listen totheir comments. One difficulty was finding a suitable site. In 1997,for example, the London Borough of Harrow invited the com-mittee to bid for a large plot of land in an appropriate area whichhad been earmarked for a place of worship, or for recreationalpurposes. The committee was enthusiastic and submitted a bid,but it was not successful.132Finding a suitable place has alwaysbeen a problem.Almost inevitably, opposition surfaced. The objections were thatthe present premises were well served by public transport and pro-vided a place of worship in the centre of London, suitable for thepoor and elderly. In fact, some argued, the building was under-utilised apart from a small number of events each year. The pres-entSetayesh Gah, it was said, was little used on a regular basis, sowhat reason was there for thinking that an Atash Dadgah, sometwenty miles from the centre, would be much used? The fear wasexpressed that future generations might not be able to maintainsuch a large property, just like some Parsi communities in Indiaand Zanzibar. On the question of parking, it was asked whetherthe expense justified the acquisition of a hundred spaces for abouttwenty occasions per annum. There was concern that the estim-ates were too optimistic and that the new premises would costmore, and would not be supportable from Association funds. Thesteering committee had put out a questionnaire in 1997 to solicitviews; critics pointed out that there was only a 25% response,which was not an adequate basis for proceeding.At a forum in July 1997 this survey was discussed. An area of con-cern was the Association’s funds. These, being heavily dependent oninvestments in the stock market, could go down, just as they hadincreased in recent times. It was, therefore, suggested that subscrip-tions should be increased to provide a secure income. The survey,analysed by the YZs, independent of the Managing Committee, hadan impact upon committee thinking. For example, the priority ofmost respondents (58%) was a place of worship, followed by 23%The Zoroastrian Trust Funds of Europe402132Newsletter, 22 Apr., 1997."},{"pageNumber":422,"pageContent":"giving priority to a larger assembly hall, and 7% to a ‘chapel of rest’(bungli). Only 3–4% gave priority to a library, sports facilities oraccommodation, so the committee then said they would now notpursue these options. Forty-nine per cent of respondents stressedthat they wanted a dadgah, but more than a third, 38%, wanted afully consecrated agiary. Importantly, 81% of youth respondents (aged15–25) gave a place of worship as the highest priority—comparedwith only 68% of those over 50. The committee also noted the geo-graphical distribution of respondents: 34% were from north-westLondon, 20% from north-east London, 11% from south-westLondon and 8% from south-east London. A further noteworthypoint to arise from the survey was that a majority (58%) thought thatthe Association should have a full-time salaried priest rather thancontinue with the present voluntary, part-time arrangement.133Most annual reports of any Association try to give an ‘up-beat’account of the health of the community. But the ZTFE AnnualReport for the year 2000 was particularly positive in tone. It mer-its analysis, despite being somewhat repetitive of what I have writ-ten above, because it highlights what the community, not anoutsider, considers to have been the key developments. The high-light was said to be ‘the recognition of Zoroastrianism as one ofthe nine major religions of the United Kingdom and representa-tion in the Faith Zone of the Millennium Dome’. Other highpoints were the visits of the Association’s great benefactors, Mrand Mrs Mehraban Zartoshty and Dastur Kotwal, the election ofFilly Maravala as mayor of the London Borough of Redbridgeand the development of the Zarthoshty Brothers Chair inZoroastrian Studies at SOAS. The report also announced withdelight, both in the text and in the colour photograph on thecover, the acquisition of the new premises. At a special meeting on9 November 1999 the committee had been mandated to executethe New Premises Project. Within six weeks of hearing of theavailability of a now disused cinema in Harrow, the region ofLondon where most Zoroastrians live, the outstanding funds wereraised to purchase this property, built in a classic Art Deco style. Itwas purchased for £1,358,000 on 29 September 2000, over halfthe sum having been given by the Zarthoshty brothers.

Jila produced a detailed report on what thisinvolved in religious terms.134The report was based on meetingswith seven leading and appropriate people in Mumbai and visitsto the four Atash Bahrams and six agiaryies in Mumbai.135Thesignificance of this is that ZTFE was taking greater care to ensurethe acceptance of the project by traditional authoritative sourcesin India, than had been taken for any other project planned in theWest, again illustrating the religious ties in Britain with the oldcountry. The report detailed requirements for a greenhouse forthe necessary plants and a well, and outlined the essential featuresof the structure (the axis of the building, steps, security, the essen-tial rooms and the design of the sanctuary). Finally it indicated thekey rituals involved in the foundations and consecration of theAtash Dadgah. The whole report was checked and receivedsigned approval by Dastur Kotwal. Few Associations have takensuch care over ensuring the precise religious requirements.136London as an international centreFrom the Association’s inception, it has always had a European per-spective. Over the decades countless prominent figures have calledas they ‘passed through’ the heart of the Empire, for example theParsi members of the Round Table conferences in the build-up toIndian Independence. Parsis from America and Europe have beenburied at Brookwood. In the 1970s, visiting Zoroastrians, priest andlay, ‘called upon’ the Association. That ‘calling’ has become a moresubstantial visiting. From the 1980s, Khojeste Mistree became a notinfrequent teacher of seminars. Dastur Kotwal made several visits inthe 1990s and a long one in 2000.

British par-ticipation has also been evident in North American ZoroastrianCongresses during the 1990s, and in the American-led calls for a new world body (see Chapter 10). Closer contacts betweenAssociations are to be expected as an aspect of globalization, butthere is also a sense of the British Zoroastrians, being the oldest andlargest Association outside the old countries, having a legitimateleadership role in the global Zoroastrian diaspora. To this end, it issignificant that ZTFE has bid to host the next World ZoroastrianCongress in 2005, following that held in Houston; this would be onlythe second time such a World Congress has been held outside Indiaor Iran. This international role is also evident in the hosting of theSecond World Zoroastrian Youth Congress, and in the emerginglinks between London and Associations in France and Germany.Zoroastrians in ParisThe contextThere is a wealth of literature on French immigration and race-relations law and policy, but little referring to South Asians.144The Zoroastrian Trust Funds of Europe405137The Zarathushtrian Saga, Calcutta, 1995.138The Turning, New Delhi, 1996.139Illusions and Disillusions, London, 1998.140See her article ‘The Parsi Voice in Recent Indian English Fiction: An Assertion ofEthnic Identity’, in N.

Thereafter, there have been fluctuating attempts torestrict immigration, and a failed attempt to persuade immigrantworkers to return to their old countries in 1977–8. But generallythere has been a policy of integration of those who haveimmigrated.147In general terms, whereas Britain emphasizes plu-rality, France stresses integration. The focus has been differentaccording to the Left or Right inclinations of the governments ofthe day, though most governments have been restricted by popularopinion, and at times by the extreme demands of the extremeRight, notably J.

France has also generally attached import-ance to a programme of family reunification, so that immigrationin total has not stopped.

Some of my informants stressed that they wished to beanonymous and, of course, that wish is respected in what follows.Others were happy to be identified, and so they are. The inter-views behind my account were conducted on a one-to-one basis,partly for reasons of confidentiality, partly also because peoplewould answer differently in front of others. Before turning tothose interviews it is important to refer if only briefly to (Madame)Bhikaiji Cama (1836–1936), an early vigorous campaigner for Indian Independence who lived in exile in Paris. Born andeducated in Bombay she was married to Rustomji the son ofK. R. Cama, but it was an unhappy marriage. She came to Britainin 1901 for medical treatment and was inspired by various Hinduradicals, notably the anarchist Shyamji Krishna Verma. Her ownspeeches and articles were fiery, and to avoid imprisonment inBritain she fled to Paris where she lived most of her life. Shestarted various radical journals. The first was Vanemataram, whichwas published in Geneva and smuggled into India through theFrench city of Pondicherry. She is said to have smuggled armsthrough the same route. Speaking fluent French, German andEnglish, she made various lecture tours in America and Europe.She is famed for unfurling what became the national flag ofIndependent India at a meeting in Germany in 1907.

In the inter-war years various Parsi dignit-aries, notably Sir Dhunjibhoy Bomanji, Sir Cowasji JehangirReadymoney, members of the Adenwala family and the Tatas vis-ited Paris, and made contact with the few Parsi families livingthere. They were following in something of a tradition, because anumber of the nineteenth-century travellers quoted above,notably Kothari, also visited Paris, which they decided was a bet-ter place than London for its culture. During the war Cooper andhis brother were at first interned for being British subjects, butwhen released they fled to the south of France, taking their valu-ables, for example Mr Cooper’s pearls, with them. After the warhe tried returning to India, but comments that he did not findIndia the same when it was not under British rule and so wentback to Paris. There he and two other families (Bhownagary andDasturs) celebrated major functions together, notably Pateti andNo Ruz at each other’s homes. In 1955 he went to Bombay to getmarried, and in 1956 the first of his daughters was born.

She was imprisoned,tortured and sentenced to death, but had managed to escape andleave the country, so she settled in France where she had taken aPh.D. In Iran, her grandmother had been visibly a Zoroastrian,but her father was not officially one. For her, one cannot be aZoroastrian clandestinely: daily prayers are essential and one shouldlead a life of truth, for Zoroastrianism is a way of life. Her initiationwas performed in Los Angeles. She has been invited back to Iran byher family still there, but she was reluctant to go. She did not thinkthat there would be a French Zoroastrian Association, because allZoroastrians in Paris are old. Zoroastrianism, she thought, wouldnecessarily change. In Iran the religion was concerned to reverencenature; she did not think the strictness of the religion would be main-tained. She also commented on the number of conversions toZoroastrianism among Iranians and Armenians.One Parsi woman from India worked in Paris for eighteenmonths and enjoyed it so much that she stayed.

However,the two groups, Parsis and Iranian Zoroastrians, do not meet asgroups, only occasionally at an individual level. At the time of myvisit there was a dispute within the Iranian community betweenthose who did, and those did not, attend the funeral in Paris of theformer Prime Minister Bhaktiar. Both Parsi and IranianZoroastrians told me that there was a fundamental differencebetween the two groups: whereas the Parsis are accustomed to ademocratic and secure society, Iranian Zoroastrians are not, andcoming from a repressive country, they are reluctant to speakopenly or give addresses and personal details. More than one per-son stated that since the revolution there had been people convert-ing to Zoroastrianism. Others also commented that a number ofFrench Muslims joined with Zoroastrians at the main festivals.The resulting picture from these personal experiences is that it isdifficult to speak of a community in Paris. It is, rather, a questionof individuals occasionally meeting socially as Parsis, i.e. as anethnic group, with no communal Zoroastrian practice, althoughone or two older people continue their religious practice in pri-vate. Virtually everyone said that they had no knowledge of thereligion, though all thought its emphasis on good thoughts, wordsand deeds made it a religion worthy of respect. Work, or a love ofthe city, the conviction that Paris is a civilized place to be, broughtpeople there and few thought of leaving it. It is noticeable howmany read Parsianaas a means of keeping in touch, howeverremotely, with the community. There was commonly a sense ofpride in being Parsi, but because their meetings are essentially eth-nic socializing, they are not the sort of functions where Parsis meetIranian Zoroastrians. Each group seems to know very little of theother. The information I was given suggested that the IranianZoroastrians also met ethnically, rather than religiously, which iswhy they were joined by other Iranians, perhaps more often thanby Parsis. Few of them had contact with Zoroastrians or Parsis out-side France and their old country, apart from those who had closerelatives in other countries, e.g. Australia and USA. On the anal-ogy of a wheel, those who maintained contacts with otherZoroastrians did so as spokes to the hub of India, but there was norim of international networking. This may change if ZTFEattempts to improve links are more successful. The determinationThe Zoroastrian Trust Funds of Europe412"},{"pageNumber":432,"pageContent":"of some individuals to continue the practice of their religion isremarkable. What is striking is the sense of pride in their identityon the part of everyone, whatever their religious position. Whennumbers are so small, there is little scope for erecting strong com-munity barriers against the intermarrieds, or against others withno Zoroastrian ancestry. From a Zoroastrian perspective the con-trast between London and Paris is considerable.Zoroastrians in GermanyThe contextThe laws on immigration and citizenship are different in Germanyfrom those Britain and France. What follows concerns race andimmigration policies at the time when I visited Germany (1997).The law has changed at the start of the new millennium, makingit easier for people to acquire German citizenship. In Britain thelaw is based on the idea ofius soli, i.e. citizenship of the place ofbirth, so that people born in Britain are British citizens. InGermany citizenship laws are based on ius sanguinis, i.e. citizenshipby descent, so, in theory at least, a third-generation Indian inGermany would not be German but remain Indian, of the race oftheir parents, or grandparents. Until the early 1970s, Germanyneeded labour, manual and professional, so that immigration intothe country was relatively easy and a number came for study aswell as for employment. As unemployment decreased in the 1970s,immigration became considerably more difficult. The assumptionbehind German law and policy is that the student or visitingworker will not assimilate, and will not stay permanently but returnto the country of origin. Such a person is therefore a Gastarbeiter(guest worker), not a German citizen. This leaves various disad-vantages: work permits are job-specific and if the job is lost, or aperson becomes dependent on social welfare, they can be returnedto their ancestral home. Political and other rights are alsorestricted. In 1983 a bill was passed to encourage immigrants toreturn home, and to finance their return, but few took the ‘oppor-tunity’. Naturalization is, at the turn of the millennium, possibleeither following an extended residence in Germany, or for thoseborn in Germany. The right is there to apply; but it is not an auto-matic process. Joppke, in his comparative study of immigration inThe Zoroastrian Trust Funds of Europe413"},{"pageNumber":433,"pageContent":"Britain and Germany, stresses however, that though immigrants asimmigrants have few rights, the German Constitution protects therights of individuals and so the courts have on various occasionsprotected the rights of individual immigrants.152The securest basefor naturalization is marriage to a German. There is a strong tend-ency to emphasize the ‘otherness’ of all non-Germans, not leastthose with a different-coloured skin, or those seen to be dressingdifferently, for example wearing the hijab.153People of Germandescent automatically become German citizens when arriving inGermany. The main non-European immigrant groups inGermany are from Turkey and Yugoslavia, but Hamburg has asubstantial Iranian population. There are fewer than 140,000South Asians in Germany, of whom a little over 70,000 are fromIndia and Pakistan.154Kerala Christians apart (recruited for nurs-ing work), there are few attempts to develop communal infrastruc-tures, organization or buildings. Few take an active political role.German ZoroastriansThere are two main groups of Zoroastrians in Germany: IranianZoroastrians in and around Hamburg, and Parsis, who are fairlywidely scattered, though a number congregate in Bonn each NoRuz There is virtually no contact between these groups. At thetime of writing there is no Association, but a Parsi who has movedto Germany from the USA, Sam Motashaw, knowing how usefulAssociations have been there, wishes to start one. Some Parsiswere reluctant, on the grounds that the formal registration of anAssociation as a religious group, which takes considerable admin-istrative labour in Germany, might lead people to think that theyare a new religious movement, against which they believe there ismuch prejudice. However, both the pro-campaigner and thedoubter attended the Millennium Congress in Houston and as aresult are planning to start an Association.The Zoroastrian Trust Funds of Europe414152C Joppke,Immigration and the Nation-State,The United States, Germany, and Great Britain,Oxford, 1999, pp. 64–75.153I am grateful to Urmila Goel for permission to use her SOAS MA thesis ‘Citizenshipand Identity among Second Generation South Asians in West European Countries’, 1998(unpublished).

The ‘early’ Zoroastrianarrivals came in the 1960s, mainly to study or work in engineeringor pharmaceuticals, two areas for which post-war Germany had astrong reputation. Iranian Zoroastrians went to Hamburg, themain centre for Iranians, and for the carpet trade, in Germany.Some have moved to Germany at the behest of the multinationalemployers, some just for a fixed period. Most of the IranianZoroastrians came after the revolution, but the number of newarrivals has diminished considerably, partly because conditionsare better under the more moderate regime in Iran, and partlybecause émigrés have all their family property confiscated by theState. There is a high proportion of intermarriage, because thereare so few Zoroastrians in Germany that people are unlikely tomeet a partner there. I met only one Zoroastrian couple who hadmet and married in Germany while studying there. Some peoplewent to India for a spouse, but most married locally. Some mettheir future German partner in India, in one case when she wasworking at the German consulate in Bombay, another at the MaxMuller Bhavan (Goethe Institute) in Pune.

At theannual No Ruz celebrations there are up to 200 people present, butmany are Iranian Muslims. Several of the Iranian Zoroastrians aremarried out, but their spouses are made welcome at theirgatherings. Nowadays, Mr Morwandad says, there are only twoZoroastrians in the carpet trade, the others are professionals—lawyers, doctors, engineers and chemists. Few of them speakEnglish, and in some cases their German is reported to be halting.More than one informant said that because Hamburg was a cos-mopolitan city, there was relatively less racial prejudice there com-pared with Bavaria or East Germany. Because of the prejudice,I was told,Auslandershad to work harder than Germans, or be bet-ter at their work, to maintain any degree of parity.The Parsi married to an Iranian Zoroastrian, Mr Ichaporia,had worked in Iran, where he met his wife.

As a family they are happy in Germanyand believe Hamburg is a good part of the country for them tolive, and they see no likelihood of moving on. They keep a pictureof the Prophet on the walls of their home, but there is little oppor-tunity to partake in religious functions, and they do not haveaccess to any religious literature. It is, therefore, difficult to havemore than a sense of ethnic identity, which makes it hard todecide at No Ruz whether to attend the Iranian function inHamburg or the Parsi one in Bonn.

She criticizedthe teaching of Mistree as dualistic. She also expressed stronglywhat she believed to be Zoroastrian teachings on conception andabortion; in short, she engaged intellectually with the doctrines ofthe religion more than most of my informants.

On retirementhe plans to spend more time reading about and studying hisreligion.Several sources told me that many Iranian Muslims commentprivately that they are secret Zoroastrians. A number ofZoroastrians in Hamburg told me of their interest in, and somecontact with, Kurdish Zoroastrians. Indeed, I was taken for din-ner with one. He said that there were some 5,000 Yezidis inGermany, where they were able to migrate because they weretaken for Turkish workers. Back in Turkey he put the numbers at50–100,000. He told me that there were few Zoroastrian prac-tices, no sudreandkustior texts, because of Turkish oppression.But, he said, the Yezidis think of themselves as having aZoroastrian history going back many centuries. He related anaccount of how on successive occasions their villages had beenattacked, and the women raped and carried away. They were, hesaid, caught between Turkish oppression and the PPK who ter-rorized them into giving funds and blackmailed them.The rest of the German Zoroastrian community is Parsi andwidely scattered.

Those who were married out, or who hadGerman partners, said that their partners were interested in visit-ing India, and most who had been liked it as a place to visit.The Zoroastrian Trust Funds of Europe418155I wish to place on record my thanks to them for being such gracious hosts."},{"pageNumber":438,"pageContent":"Although some had encountered opposition to their out-marriage,most said that the immediate family had treated their spouse well,even in one case keeping in contact after the couple had divorced.In another case, however, a woman who had met a German inIndia felt thrown out by the community after her marriage,although her mother has accepted the situation. She has few Parsifriends in Germany, because of the distances, so she would like anAssociation to be formed, because she enjoys the meetings.Clearly for her, social contacts with her community are important,despite her sense of rejection. Very few of them read Zoroastrianliterature, apart from Parsiana. But some felt that it focused toomuch on the (insular) BPP, and that the news commonly showedreligious intolerance. The emphasis on scandals and on felicita-tions between fellow Indian Parsis looked insular from their per-spective, and neglected the religion. However much myinformants missed Mumbai, only those on temporary businesssecondment could imagine returning to live there. Severalexpressed interest in the formation of an Association, but few sawa long-term future for Zoroastrianism in Germany, because thefamilies were so few and so scattered, and there were so few youngpeople.I had the opportunity to talk to a number of young Zoroastrianson a one-to-one basis. Their comments are separated from those ofthe family in order to preserve their anonymity. There is no singlepattern to describe identity. Even within one family, one siblingenjoyed visiting Parsi temples in India, the other did not; onegroup considered themselves German, the other had supportedIran during the 1998 soccer world cup. One young Zoroastriansaid he had not visited Mumbai since his naujote, and although hewould quite like to go again, he feared that it would be a visit spentin a hotel calling upon people he did not know. Yet he also felt iso-lated in Germany. He knew very few Indians, fewer Parsis, andsocializing with Germans, he said, was difficult. One youngZoroastrian, whose family was rejected by the community whenhis mother married out, is proud to be Indian, likes to visit India,has pictures of Indian deities (not Zoroastrian motifs) in his roomand has undertaken research on India language and society. Forhim his Indian identity appears paramount and his Parsi orZoroastrian identity is non-existent. Most younger people I spoketo who had been born in Germany said that they did not feel atThe Zoroastrian Trust Funds of Europe419"},{"pageNumber":439,"pageContent":"home there or in India, and thought if they visited Iran they wouldnot expect to feel at home there either. This was asserted both bypeople who practised their religion, and by those who did not. Oneyoung Zoroastrian, shortly to marry a Zoroastrian from the oldcountry, spoke forcibly about the pressure put on youngZoroastrians to marry into the fold. This, he said, means that assoon as they socialize with Zoroastrians of the opposite sex, every-one speculates on whether they will get married. The result is thatit puts the youngsters off such social contacts and drives them intocontacts with non-Zoroastrian and so increases intermarriage.156This informant was the only young Zoroastrian I met in Germanywho is marrying into the religion. But despite the fact that some ofthe young people are finding German partners, there is generally adeeper perception of racial prejudice, of being ‘othered’, inGermany than I have found in any country visited in the course ofthis research. Although many appreciated the quality of life inGermany, more than one aspired to retire to another westerncountry and no one asserted a strong sense of being German. Thebarriers were seen to have been erected by Germans.European Links with ZTFEApart from a (very) few personal links between Zoroastrians inmainland Europe and Britain, there was no contact between thepeople discussed in the last two sections and ZTFE. However, atthe start of the new millennium there are moves to make contact.This was first publicly expressed in the substantially increasednumber of French and German Zoroastrians listed in the 2000Directory produced by ZTFE.157These links are in part due to theglobal move to have contacts between Associations. This had beenhappening informally between ZTFE and American Associationsparticularly at the times of a World Congress, or in discussionsabout the controversial WZO discussed in Chapter 10. When theproposal of a rival body to WZO composed of federal bodies, forexample the Federation of Zoroastrians in India and theFederation of Zoroastrian Associations of North AmericaThe Zoroastrian Trust Funds of Europe420156He pleaded that I include this point in my book.

This coincided with some individuals settling inGermany who had lived in larger Zoroastrian communities else-where and sought international contacts.

As a first step he attended the No Ruz in Bonn in2001, so that the first semi-official contacts were of an enjoyable,social nature. The nature of that Federation would clearly needsensitive handling, because no Zoroastrian group likes to feel‘swallowed up’ and there are significant differences between thegroups in the three countries, not least in what is in Britain thevery sensitive area of intermarriage.ConclusionThe key turning pointsThere have been a number of key turning points in the history ofZoroastrians in Britain, which have affected the nature of the com-munity here. The early travellers reinforced Parsi perceptions oftheir relations with the British. They also reinforced the educa-tional priorities of leading members in the old country. The for-mation of the Association in 1861 created the earliest AsianAssociation in the western world and with the arrival of a signific-ant number of Zoroastrians in the 1960s Britain became part ofboth the old and the new Zoroastrian diaspora communities. Theearly emphasis on the European dimension of the Association andthe petitions to the Shah emphasized the perception of the BritishZoroastrians as being at the ‘heart of empire’, though perhaps thebiggest factor in this was the role of the three MPs, somethingunequalled in political achievement anywhere in the diaspora. Theacquisition of a property, the first in 1920, similarly locates theBritish Zoroastrians as a mid-point between the old and the newdiasporas. The property was acquired at a later date than those inSind, China and East Africa, but decades before those on theNorth American continent or Australia. The changing nature ofthe four buildings, Cromwell Road, Russell Road, CompayneGardens and Harrow, reflect the changing nature of the commun-ity. It is not simply that the Association is numerically larger; therehas also been an increasing emphasis on the provision of space forThe Zoroastrian Trust Funds of Europe421"},{"pageNumber":441,"pageContent":"worship. A key factor in the second half of the twentieth centurywas the arrival of some Iranian Zoroastrians, though in terms ofnumbers and influence even more important was the arrival of theEast African Zoroastrians. When they came to positions of com-munal power in the late 1980s there was a significant swingtowards Orthodoxy. At the turn of the century a key turning pointwas the involvement in inter-faith activities, and the impact this hashad on the position of Zoroastrians and their recognition in Britishsociety.British Zoroastrians and British AsiansThere are various ways in which the Zoroastrian, specifically theParsi, patterns of settlement in Britain have paralleled those ofother South Asian communities. Above all, Parsis and SouthAsians have been subject to the same experience of immigrationand race-relations policies. Parsis were free to settle in Britain priorto the 1960s without visas or entry permits. Although theAssociation has a longer history than any other South Asian com-munity, nevertheless the majority of its members came in the 1960sand since then new primary migration has been restricted. Theyhave been affected, as any other South Asian community, by theexperience of discrimination, and race-relations legislation.Although Zoroastrians typically do not want to be seen as Asian,the stark reality is that that is how most outsiders see them. As withother communities, the impact of East African Asian migration inthe 1960s has been considerable, especially in their traditionalreligious orientation. There have been important religious leadersamong British Zoroastrians, for example Ervad Zal Sethna, anOrthodox East African who was elected president of theAssociation. At the turn of the century, the most active of the priests,Ervad Rustom Bhedwar, has been elected onto the ManagingCommittee precisely because of the importance attached to reli-gious issues, but generally the leadership has been in the hands ofthe laity. As with other British Asians, both religion and the gen-eral culture,Parsi-panu, are seen as key factors in the preservation of identity among the youth as among the elders. It would beoversimplistic to say that there is one common pattern of assimi-lation, of being caught between cultures, or being skilled culturalnavigators; British Zoroastrian youth are at least as diverse as theirelders are.The Zoroastrian Trust Funds of Europe422"},{"pageNumber":442,"pageContent":"There are other ways in which British Zoroastrians can be seento be different from other British Asians. The length of their his-tory of settlement in Britain, their perception of themselves asbeing like, and being liked by, the British—despite the experienceof racial discrimination—has given a different social role and self-image among British Zoroastrians. Their positive perception ofbeing at the ‘heart of the empire’, of the benefits accrued by lifein Britain, of their sense of their historical importance as an inter-national group, and not least their pride in their MPs and otherpolitical leaders, is something which marks them as different andhas an impact on their self-image. Whereas the vast majority ofother British South Asian migrants came as manual workers, themajority of primary British Zoroastrian migrants, both in thenineteenth and the twentieth centuries came as educated profes-sionals. There have been some merchants, for example that is howDadabhai Naoroji and K. R. Cama first came to Britain, and itwas the role that gave Sir Dhunjibhoy Bomanjee his fabulouswealth. But typically Parsis came as doctors, lawyers and engi-neers. Whereas most early South Asian migrants lived in innercity areas seeking to save money to send back to India,Zoroastrians typically went straight to the leafy suburbs. Thelonger history of the Zoroastrian community means that theyhave a more diverse age range, with a greater proportion of eld-ers, and of the second- and third-generation young. One obviousdistinctive and important feature is their much smaller numbers.The most optimistic estimate of their numbers as 10,000 inBritain still leaves them far smaller than any other communityfrom the Indian subcontinent. That has consequent implicationsfor their limited financial and human resources, and means thattheir voting power is weaker. Perhaps the most important distinc-tion is that few Parsis see themselves as Asians. They have manyfacets to their sense of self-identity, but for most their Persianorigins are of considerable importance.British and other Zoroastrian diasporasIt is premature to undertake a comparison between British andother western diasporas that have not yet been considered.However, it is worth noting the differences from the other olderdiasporas considered in preceding chapters. The early BritishZoroastrians were less business-orientated than the early travellersThe Zoroastrian Trust Funds of Europe423"},{"pageNumber":443,"pageContent":"to China or Sind, but more professional, like the Zanzibari Parsis.In all of the earlier diasporas Parsis were involved with the Britishin trade, but the wider ‘local’ society was seen as significantly‘other’. There were few social contacts with the Chinese, BlackAfricans or the various groups in Sind (Pathans, Sindhis, etc.).Because of their self-perception as being favoured and respectedby the British, there was less sense of living in a potentially hostileenvironment which may be the explanation for why it took themproportionately much longer to make material provisions for thereligion, e.g. a temple and full-time priest. In Britain, they com-monly saw the significant distinctions to be those of class ratherthan race. That is why Naoroji and Bhownaggree could stand forParliament. (Saklatvalla is a more complicated phenomenon—being of high social class but opposed to class divisions in society.)Bhownaggree was able to invite British dignitaries to Zoroastrians’functions because of his class. Because Zoroastrians were at theheart of empire, the ‘big names’ who were associated with themwere not only their own MPs and wealthy individuals, but alsothose who came from India, for example Sir Pheroze Sethna andSir Cowasjee Jehangir Readymoney as part of the Round Tableconferences in their search for greater Indian autonomy. AlthoughBombay Parsis had similar perceptions of class, it was not such afactor in the other old diasporas. Parsis were not allowed to social-ize with the Chinese, and did not wish to in Africa as they had inIndia, and as they did in Britain. The nature of the Zoroastrianexperience is different among scattered groups—Zoroastrians liv-ing as individuals away from Associations and religious functions,whether in East Africa, or in modern France and Germany.Zoroastrians in London have a significant advantage over theseindividuals because of the support of an active Zoroastrian net-work. The question now to be addressed is, how is the BritishZoroastrian diaspora the same as or different from other westerngroups?The Zoroastrian Trust Funds of Europe424"},{"pageNumber":444,"pageContent":"8Zoroastrians in the United States and CanadaIntroductionThis chapter, like the previous one, includes more than one country;but the United States (US) and Canada are more intertwined thanBritain, France and Germany were seen to be.1In what follows,where the subject relates to the whole North American continent,as it sometimes does, then the label America is used; the US refersonly to the United States of America. People outside the Americancontinent often see the two countries as parts of a whole. This issometimes appropriate for Zoroastrian history; for example, theFederation of Zoroastrian Associations of North America,FEZANA, is an overarching body for Associations in both coun-tries; its officers are drawn from either and its excellent magazineis circulated in both. But Canadians in particular often wish tostress their differences from the US in terms not only of politics butalso of culture and the law. It is certainly important to begin thediscussion of the immigration and race-relations policies of thetwo separately.1Work on this introduction, and that to the Australia chapter, owes a great deal to Mrs J. Leeming of the University Library, Derby, for an extensive literature search sheundertook for me, and to Maria Leontiner for tracking down many of the publicationswhile I was hospitalized. It is dangerous to begin naming Zoroastrians who have helpedme, because there have been so many. They know who they are and I thank them all. ButI do have to pay especial thanks to the Rivetna family. Roshan and Rohinton have not onlyhosted me on several occasions, they have also plied me with much material from their ownhuge archive, and both kindly read through the draft of this chapter. I am also indebted toDolly Dastoor for her ready help, and for reading this chapter. Any mistakes that remainare, of course, my own responsibility. I am grateful also to Kaemerz and Hvovi Dotiwallawith whom I have stayed several times; even by Zoroastrian standards they have been verygenerous hosts.

One reason is the growing importanceand influence of American Zoroastrians at the beginning of themillennium. But the subject also requires more extensive treatmentbecause of its complexity. In other chapters, it has been necessaryto look at only two or three Associations. On the American contin-ent there are over twenty Associations, with a mix of nationalities(Iranian, Indian, Pakistani, East African, Canadian and American),plus the diversity of the many differences between states, not justbetween Canada and the United States, but between Associationswithin each of those countries. The vast distances, and other factors,have made for a greater diversity in the Zoroastrian population onthis continent than is found elsewhere.The Context: US immigration and race policyThe inscription on the Statue of Liberty invites to the US ‘yourtired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free’.This is not an accurate depiction of the broad swathe of USimmigration policy. It is common to divide the history of the vari-ous policies into the following periods.21.The Colonial Period, 1609–1775, the period of European, largelyProtestant British, recruitment of labour for land conquest and the genocideof the Native American people. The Puritans were but one group whodeveloped the colonies for religious reasons.2.The Open Door era, 1776–1881, when immigrants were activelysought. This is a major phase of American history but not relevantto the theme of this book.3.The Era of Regulation, 1882–1916, when a long phase of monit-oring arrivals began, ‘so that only those thought to be most adapt-able to American society would be admitted’. The regulations weremainly against the Chinese in western USA, but there was alsoreaction against the Sikhs who moved from British Columbia toZoroastrians in the USA and Canada4262See, e.g. W. S. Bernard, ‘Immigration: History of U.S. Policy’, in S. Thernstrom (ed.),Harvard Encyclopaedia of American Ethnic Groups, Cambridge, Mass., 1980, pp. 486–95. Seealso A. Behdad, ‘Nationalism and Immigration to the United States’,Diaspora, 6:2, 1997,pp. 155–78. Particularly useful for this chapter is S.

By theend of the nineteenth century moves were undertaken to restrictimmigration. In 1910 a congressionally appointed commissionreported on what it considered to be the alarming aspects of immig-ration. It argued that new immigrants were racially inferior to theold immigrants from northern and western Europe. Such viewscame to dominate in the next period.4.The Era of Restriction, 1917–1964. The Immigration Act of 1917included a literacy test for those over 16. No labourers were allowedfrom the Asiatic Barred Zone, which included India. Indians wereno longer recognized as Caucasians.4The Act also centralized pol-icy as a Federal and not simply a State issue. The Quota [ Johnson]Act of 1921 restricted the annual number of entrants of eachadmissible country to 3% of that nationality which had beenrecorded in the US Census of 1910. No limitations were placed onimmigration from the western hemisphere. Nor were restrictionsplaced on Mexico, because of the need for cheap labour. In 1921 anew ‘non-quota’ category was included which allowed in, amongothers, people in the performing arts, academia and medicine. In1924 the Johnson-Reid Act tightened restrictions, reducing theannual quota of foreign-born nationals from 3% to 2% in the 1890census—an even lower census base than had been taken in the 1921Act. From the perspective of Indian migration, it effectively meantthere was no quota for the subcontinent. The Supreme Court ruledin 1923 that Indians were no longer considered ‘free white persons’,but were defined as Asian under immigration and naturalizationprocedures, and so came from the ‘Asiatic Barred Zone’.5In hispresentation of the Act Johnson said that the American people:have seen, patient and plain, the encroachments of the foreign-bornflood upon their own lives...the myth of the melting pot has been dis-credited....The United States is our land. If it was not the land of ourfathers, at least it may be, and it should be, the land of our children. Weintend to maintain it so. The day of unalloyed welcome to all peoples,the day of indiscriminate acceptance of all races, has definitely ended.6Zoroastrians in the USA and Canada4273R. B.

The depression ofthe 1930s meant that fewer people wanted to migrate to the US,and the Government imposed ever more restrictions on those whomight become charges upon the State, including Jews fleeing theNazi regime.7In the early years following the Second World War,entry restrictions were eased for war brides, and displaced personsfrom such places as Hungary and Indonesia were admitted inorder to win some Cold War allies. On the other hand, anyonewith Communist party membership was excluded. In 1952 theImmigration and Nationality [McCarran-Walter] Act ‘tidied up’the previous decades of change and ensured that northern andwestern European nations took up 85% of the total annual quotaof immigrants. It eased entry requirements in one significant way:special-preference categories were introduced for immigrants withextraordinary educational or technical training, or with specialabilities. From the Indian perspective, one important feature wasthe opening of the doors to students. In the 1960s America’sproclamation to lead the free world seemed incompatible with itsnationality/racially based immigration policy and John F. Kennedycalled for drastic change. He, however, was concerned with allow-ing more European Catholics into the country. Similarly, the term‘melting pot’ was not originally used for the assimilation of Asianpeoples, but only for the blending of different European national-ities after the First World War.85.The Era of Liberalization, post-1965. The Hart-Celler Act waspassed in 1965, taking effect in 1968. It raised the number ofmigrants to 290,000. Other western hemisphere countries wereallocated 120,000 visas; the eastern hemisphere was allocated170,000, but no more than 20,000 to any one country. Thechange for India was significant because the previous quota sys-tem had militated against them; now the criteria were free ofracial or historical implications. But even the Hart-Celler Act wasnot designed to facilitate more Asian migration; it specificallyZoroastrians in the USA and Canada4287See M. J.

However this changed in 1976 when the allocations for eastern and western hemispheres were equalized.9The Hart-Celler Act gave preference to four categories of familymembers and to two categories of employment. From the perspect-ive of the subcontinent the family preferences were less importantthan the employment opportunities, because so few people fromIndia and Pakistan already resided in the US. The two employmentcategories were: (a) members of the professions of exceptional abil-ity and their spouses and children, and (b) ‘workers in skilled orunskilled occupations in which laborers are in short supply in theUnited States, their spouses and children’.10The result was a sub-stantial increase in the number of Indian-born migrants to theUnited States. Decadel figures for all Asian migrants are: 1974 —131,000; 1984 —256,000; 1994 —292,000. In this ‘all Asian’ groupapproximately one-third came for employment entry, the othersunder family preferences.11Whereas in the 1980 census there were371,630 South Asians in the US, by 1990 there were 896,818(815,447 from India, 81,371 from Pakistan).12Because most SouthAsians settled under employment criteria, most came as English-speaking, well educated (30% college graduates; 54% postgradu-ates), young, middle-class, urban professionals, with a substantialproportion of doctors and engineers, the professions the US neededmost. Indeed, India became the world’s largest exporter of medicaldoctors, and there were more western-trained Iranian doctors in theUS than in Iran.

It was claimed that everyone’s (or at least allEuropeans’) cultural heritage would melt down, or fuse, into thepot of American society, so that each country contributed its ownrich flavour to the whole.21The ideal was that ‘we are now allAmericans, but we all contribute our bit to American way of life.’22Zoroastrians in the USA and Canada43013M.

It has also been estimated that 87% of Americans asso-ciate socially only with their own group.23The same researchersconcluded, on the subject of competing ethnic prides: ‘certain eth-nic groups are demonstrably the target of widespread prejudiceand hate, and many of the groups surveyed expressed disdainedsuspicion of all groups but their own.’ The White working class,they found, were plainly racist in their attitudes, towards Blacks inparticular, and were hostile and distrustful towards immigrant eth-nics in general and the law has not always offered appropriate pro-tection to religious minorities.24Because the US is such a large anddiverse country several authors have concentrated on the situationin different cities.25To write about Zoroastrians, not only in differ-ent cities in the US but also in Canada, is to encompass a particu-larly large and complex subject.Iranian migration to the USBefore turning to Canada, it is important to comment on Iranianmigration also, for whereas Iranian Zoroastrians have not beenprominent in the communities discussed in previous chapters, theydo feature largely in certain areas of the North American conti-nent. The Iranian migration is a more complex phenomenon thanthe Indian, because some Iranians came as immigrants while oth-ers came as refugees. Most governments are more wary ofrefugees than of immigrants, for the latter can be selected accord-ing to their potential contribution to the nation.

The first movement from Irantook place in the period 1950–77 when approximately 35,000came to study in America. Numbers grew dramatically after theoil price boom because Iranian families could afford to send theirchildren to university and the universities in Iran could notexpand quickly enough to take in the numbers, nor could theyspeedily supply the technical and other resources for the sciencesubjects in particular. Most Iranians during this era came as immig-rants. The revolution in 1979 triggered more movements ofrefugees. Between 1978 and 1986 approximately 104,000 Iraniansmigrated to the US, again mostly students, but among the refugeescame both wealthy, urbanized people from Tehran, and some lesswealthy and less well-educated Iranians. The numbers were attheir highest in the years between the revolution and the closure ofthe American embassy in Tehran—when direct migration to theUS became harder. It is notoriously difficult to give precise numbers,partly because there are no reliable sources, and partly becausesome groups wish to inflate the figure in order to be seen as morepolitically important. A cautious estimate puts Iranian immigrantsat: 1965—c.1,500; 1978—5,861; 1980—121,000; 1986—250,000.Because such a high proportion came as students, they are ahighly professional and economically successful group.26After LosAngeles the largest groups of Iranians are found in San Francisco,New York (approximately 10% of Iranians in the USA) and thenin Texas, with a high proportion of Iranian students in Houston.27Many of the students subsequently took out US citizenship. Itshould be noted that a significant number of Iranian Zoroastriansalso migrated to Canada, particularly Vancouver and a number toToronto.Although various writers comment that the different Iraniangroups do not intermingle, and that the Muslims are not accus-tomed to forming associations, there are important indicators ofZoroastrians in the USA and Canada43226M.

All this is yet more true of Iranian Zoroastrians than ofany other religious group, for the Zoroastrians see themselves asthe ‘true ancient Persians’.Canadian immigrationThere is an old truism that Canada is a nation of immigrants. Ittakes more immigrants per capita than does the US, the majoritycoming from non-traditional sources, notably Asia.29It has had totake in migrants not simply because of a low fertility rate, with asmall population in a large country, but also because since the nine-teenth century it has lost considerable numbers annually to the US.In the 1900 US census 1.2 million were recorded as Canadian-born, a figure which constituted one-quarter of Canada’s popu-lation at that time. It is estimated that between 1820 and 1990 4.3 million migrated south of the border.30However, the Canadianimmigration policy has long been to confine entry strictly to WhiteNorth Europeans, particularly English and French. The earliestrecorded South Asian arrivals came at the start of the twentiethcentury. A few Punjabis, mainly Sikhs, travelled across Canada enroute to the coronation of Edward VII in 1902. On their returnthey took back accounts of a land which inspired some to travel andsettle. In the years 1904–8 there were 5,179 Punjabi settlers.31Until1906 there were few problems. They were treated as British sub-jects, the economy was flourishing and labour was in short supply.Zoroastrians in the USA and Canada43328‘The Poetics and Practice of Iranian Nostalgia in Exile’,Diaspora, 1:3, 1991,pp. 285–302.29J.

When migrants arrived 900 at a time in ships, oppositiongrew.32So in 1908 an Order in Council was laid which required allmigrants to arrive with a through ticket on a continuous journeyfrom their homeland direct to British Columbia, then the only portof entry for Asians. As no ships sailed direct from India to Canada,travellers had to change ship in Hong Kong, and, with no throughticketing, this requirement effectively stopped immigration fromIndia. The ban was total and included wives and children. Men visiting India experienced difficulty when trying to re-enter Canada.The social treatment of the Punjabis was completely exclusionary.The British supported the Canadian policy, subject only to the con-sideration that they did not want it to excite nationalist feelings inIndia. The treatment of the settlers was such that this is preciselywhat it did. In 1914 an enterprising Sikh chartered a ship, theKomagata Maru, to sail from Calcutta, collecting more migrants en route in China and Japan. When it arrived at Vancouver theauthorities compelled it to anchor in the bay, would not allow anynew settlers to disembark (only a few returnees), and also refusedprovisions or the taking away of waste. Life for the 376 passengers(including two women and three children) was extremely unpleas-ant for two months. Eventually the passengers agreed to a single testcase instead of each person’s individual right to a court hearing, aprocess during which lawyers could have hoped to find loopholes inthe law. The test case was lost and the Government sent a cruiser tocompel departure once the ship had been provisioned. The ensuingviolence, which led to the assassination of an official and conse-quent executions, characterized Punjabi—Canadian relations overthe years of the First World War. In the following twenty years theonly immigrants allowed were approximately 300 wives, and virtu-ally no new Asian settlers.It was not until after the Second World War, with Independencein India and other countries, and Canada’s wish for internationalZoroastrians in the USA and Canada43432Buchignani and Indra,Continuous Journey,p.22."},{"pageNumber":454,"pageContent":"credibility in the United Nations, that policies changed. The firsttentative steps towards a wider immigration policy allowed East andSouth Europeans to migrate. As far as Asia was concerned, therehad been some Chinese and Japanese migrants at the start of thecentury, but they too had faced discrimination. As for South Asians,until then virtually all settlement had been in British Columbia. In1951, in the face of pressure from India, a quota was established,allowing in 150 Indians, 100 Pakistanis and 50 Ceylonese. TheIndian total was increased to 300 two years later because of thenumber of applications. By the end of 1961, 2,388 Indian immig-rant visas had been issued and 2,000 relatives had been grantedentry, but there were still Punjabis settling in British Columbia.33In1962 the Government decided to remove all racial and nationalrestrictions from immigration regulations and in 1967 a points sys-tem was set in place. With this change, migrants came from muchof India and Pakistan. Whereas the Punjabi migration had con-sisted mostly of manual workers, the new migrants were predom-inantly professionals and managers selected to meet Canada’seconomic needs. Discrimination on the basis of race, or national-ity, was abolished; instead, the selection criteria were imposed foran ‘Independent Class’ of people, admitted on the grounds oftheir potential contribution to Canada, together with their imme-diate family (spouse and children under 18), admitted as ‘Family(later Sponsored Dependants) Class’. A third group was ‘AssistedRelatives Class’, more distant relatives who were still subject toentry selection but could obtain a bonus of fifteen points becauseof their existing family in Canada. The criteria for the first andthird groups included education, age (the elderly were disadvant-aged), language proficiency in English or French, and pre-arrangedemployment. Subsequently, an ‘Entrepreneur or Investor Class’was admitted, for which the criteria specified the amount of invest-ment required, or a time limit in which to start a business thatcreated a specific number of jobs.34In Canada the issue of immig-ration was complicated by debates over language—French andEnglish—and by political issues between the two areas of Canada,French- and English-speaking. It was to meet these problems thatZoroastrians in the USA and Canada43533Ibid., p. 106.34A. G. Green and D. A.

Thetwo regions of Canada also had different views on immigration,both European and Asian.35The peak ‘recruitment’ period was1967–71, but with a ‘tap on, tap off policy’, according to the eco-nomic state of the nation and its needs, there have been variouspeaks and troughs through the following decades. Policy has alsobeen modified according to the prioritizing of family reunification,manual and professional workers.Table 8.1 shows clearly how immigration numbers from Indiapeaked in the years 1973–5, and again in 1980–1 (though not tothe same levels). Immigration from Pakistan also peaked in1973–5. The peak number of Ugandan refugees came two yearsearlier than the migration from Kenya, although Kenya has sentmore immigrants than Uganda, and Tanzania figures similarlypeaked in 1972–6. Numbers from India and Pakistan increasedfourfold in the 1970s compared with the 1960s; from East Africait was a fourteen-fold increase.36It is important to note not only when numbers increased signi-ficantly, but also the changing nature within that migration flow.Whereas East Indians constituted only 1.7% of immigrants in1963–7, in 1983–7 they formed 9.4% of all Canadian immigrants.Whereas in 1963–7, 65.4% of South Asian immigrants were inmanagerial or professional work, in 1983–7 they constituted only10.2%. The proportion of student migrants increased signifi-cantly from 8.6% in 1963–7 to 53.2% in 1983–7. The immigrantsfrom the 1960s onwards tended to favour Ontario rather thanBritish Columbia, though East and South East Asians stillfavoured Vancouver. The 1981 census showed that almost half ofIndo-Pakistanis (the census category) were in Ontario, and a quar-ter in British Columbia.37In the late 1970s a modification of theZoroastrians in the USA and Canada43635J.

The MeechLake Accord to amend the Constitution because of the views of French-speaking people in Quebec raised questions formulticulturalism. One-third of Canada’s population were of nei-ther French nor British descent. As one editor of a magazine putit: ‘Furthermore this archaic notion of the “two founding races”takes no notice of the historical significance of our Native peoples.’40He then asked: ‘Is multiculturalism subordinate to Quebec’s dis-tinctiveness?’ The minority groups wanted a revised Constitutionthat recognized multiculturalism on the same level as bilingualism,‘if all cultural and linguistic groups are to see themselves as part ofthe fundamental character of Canada’.Immigration into Canada peaked in 1987 and 1988, at over150,000 per annum compared with under 100,000 per annumbetween 1983 and 1985; immigration from Asia and the Pacificshowing by far the greatest increase, representing 43% of alllandings.41For the purposes of this chapter the key years are the settlementyears, 1980–1990, the decade within which my survey was con-ducted; censuses were conducted at each end of that period.42Inthe 1990s, the total number of immigrants in Canada almost tre-bled in comparison with the 1980s, increasing from just under90,000 p.a., to over 250,000 p.a.

In 1977the Canadian Human Rights Act prohibited discrimination on thegrounds of ‘race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, age,sex, marital status, disability or conviction for an offence for whicha pardon has been granted’.47In 1982 the Canadian Charter ofRights and Freedoms was entrenched in the Constitution so thatrights could not readily be eradicated. The Equal Rights Sectioncame into force in 1982. In 1987 a report was published calling forfurther funding, more political prominence and influence of themulticulturalism policy.48In 1994 there was an extensive nationalconsultation on immigration ‘to develop a vision of Canada whichcould in turn be used as a blueprint for the twenty-first century’.Ten key issues were identified and working groups were set up tolook at each of these. A flavour of the whole can be gathered fromthe following examples:How do we realise the benefits of immigration to Canada in areas suchas regional impact, workforce skills, job creation and international competitiveness?How do we achieve a coherent strategy within Canada and amongnations to deal with international migration pressures?Zoroastrians in the USA and Canada43944Statistics Canada,Religions in Canada, Ottawa, 1993.

The statement of the policy begins: ‘Canada will be asociety which allows all members to reach their potential, a soci-ety with common values and obligations, a society which respectsindividual rights and a peaceful society.’ The Government lookedfor migrants with the appropriate skills-base for Canada’s needs,to enhance the positive effects of immigration.People will have to have high levels of social capital, education, job skills,entrepreneurs, the ability to speak one official language and requiring fewsocial services. Such individuals can adjust quickly into the labour forceand generate incomes. As a result, they will contribute to the tax basewithout burdening the capital investment of Canada, namely health,education, and other social benefit plans. Thus in matching our concernto reduce costs, a greater proportion of immigrants who can immediatelyparticipate in Canadian society will be selected over those who requiresome capital investment before being able to participate and integrate.Moreover, if individuals possessing these skills have dependants, thedependants will also have to be evaluated according to their social capital.This quest focused the search for immigrants on single, independ-ent immigrants, and away from the family reunificationprogramme.49There was also an emphasis on attracting business immigrantsand people with venture capital, business acumen or entrepre-neurial skills. Substantial non-refundable fees were required tocover the costs of administering immigration, thus generating anincome which it was expected, would yield $330 million by the endof the century.50Such policies may be said to be the opposite of thedeclaration on the (American) Statue of Liberty, about sending‘your tired, your poor, your huddled masses’. On immigration (asopposed to refugee51) policy the Canadian principle was that as theZoroastrians in the USA and Canada44049Frideres, ‘Canada’s Changing Policy,’ pp. 456–60.50Ibid., pp. 461–3.51Canada has allocated a proportion of immigrant places for refugees, though thatfigure, and even the idea of a fixed number, has varied over the years. In the late 1980s,the time when my survey was conducted, Canada was looking to take 30,000 refugees.Richmond, ‘Immigration and Multiculturalism’, p. 95."},{"pageNumber":460,"pageContent":"nation needed immigrants, it must select those who would meet itsneeds, who would not create public cost, and who would bringinvestment into the country. But given that the country needed theright immigrants, it was then important to ensure the equality ofall its citizens, and their commitment to Canada and its ideals.It would, however, be a mistake to imply that Canada’s multicul-tural policy has eliminated all the racial discrimination which wasthe official policy in the ‘Whites only’ era. The mid-1970s, forexample, has been identified as a time of increasing racial discrim-ination, not least in jobs and in the spread of stereotypes of Asiansas living in squalid, overcrowded conditions, exploiting governmentservices, being clannish, arrogant and confrontational.52In the faceof propaganda from extremist groups and violence against peopleand property, even of police harassment against visible minorities inthe 1980s, a Ministry of Multiculturalism was established in 1988which called for affirmative action.53A 1997 study of a 1991 surveyof attitudes found that the majority of the population were mostcomfortable being with people of British or French origin, less com-fortable with those of various other European origins, and leastcomfortable with non-Whites. The majority were more comfortablewith people born in Canada than with new arrivals, but ‘nativity ismuch less important than occupation and ethnicity in shaping pres-tige evaluations’. The survey found that visible minorities weremore readily accepted, or had higher fraternity levels, in BritishColumbia than Ontario, and were least readily accepted in Quebec.The historic reasons for such attitudes to Asians were the allegedfear that they might swamp Canada; that they were so different asto be unassailable; that Asians competed with Whites for cheaplabour and were seen as a health hazard.54These fears are ironic in view of the fact that, proportionally, South Asians are generallyZoroastrians in the USA and Canada44152Buchignani and Indra,Continuous Journey, pp. 212–14, 218, 224, 221, 222.

There was something of a common historicalbackground between the two countries in that both had previouslysought to attract North European and (Montreal apart) Protestantmigrants. The Punjabi settlers who moved to Canada early in thetwentieth century also migrated to California. In both countriesthere were White racist policies towards the native settlers. Thepost-Second World War era, with the emergence of independentnations, India for example, forced the hand of governments whowanted influence on the world stage and especially at the UnitedNations. There were differences, of course. Canada had not hadthe open-door era that US had, nor was the US losing a substan-tial proportion of its population annually through emigration, asCanada was. In proportion to the existing general population,Canada accepted a higher ratio of immigrants than the US (1 : 30,c.f. US 1 : 73).55The problems of racism continued in both coun-tries at the popular level, but Canada developed a high-profile official commitment to multiculturalism, a commitment taken upsubsequently by other countries.Zoroastrian Settlement on the North American ContinentA profile of North American Zoroastrians in the 1980sThis section is based on my 1984–5 survey, distributed throughthe various Associations.56, 57Nine hundred and fifteen responsesZoroastrians in the USA and Canada44255Atchison, ‘Immigration’, p. 22.56I am grateful to the Associations in Los Angeles, Chicago, New York, Houston, Toronto(and later Vancouver) for allowing me to read through their files of AGMs, EGMs, commit-tee reports. In what follows I have, where possible, quoted documents that are more widelyaccessible such as congress proceedings, newsletters and Parsiana, but virtually all those refer-ences have been cross-checked with the original files. I am also deeply grateful to the familiesin the various cities who have welcomed me into their homes, sometimes on several visits.The late Jamshed and Roda Pavri in particular made me welcome on a number of occasionsand Mr Pavri gave me access to his considerable collection of records of Zoroastrians bothon Hong Kong and Vancouver. I wish to thank also the Treasureywallas and Kangas for theirgracious hospitality and Bella Tata for organizing much of my visit and driving me around.57An earlier publication of the survey findings was reprinted in Selected Papers, pp. 367–409."},{"pageNumber":462,"pageContent":"were received from the 2,000 questionnaires distributed inCanada and USA. Much of the credit for this high response rateis due to Hushtasp and Perviz Bhumgara, who distributed thequestionnaire across the American continent, and to the organ-izational efficiency of the Associations.58There were no reliableestimates of numbers of Zoroastrians in this period, but across thewhole continent a best guess would be in the order of 3,000–5,000.As a proportion of the global figure, therefore, this survey can betaken as reasonably reliable. Of course there are weaknesses, whichmust be recognized. The survey was sent out at the time of the splitbetween the largely Parsi-dominated Zoroastrian Association ofGreater New York (ZAGNY) and the Iranian ZoroastrianAssociation (IZA). The returns from the Iranian members weretherefore small. In California, one of the leading IranianZoroastrian figures, Mrs Farangis Shahrokh, went to great lengthsto encourage Iranian Zoroastrians to complete the questionnaire,so that those figures may be considered a more reliable guide toIranian Zoroastrian beliefs; though this is more true of Los Angelesthan of San Francisco. Unfortunately, in the mid-1980s my ownrelations with the Zoroastrians in British Columbia were not aswarm as they subsequently became, so the response rate from thatAssociation was low and the general totals for the rest of Canadamay be affected.59After preliminary analysis of the returns it was decided to pres-ent the material under the following headings: Chicago,California, Texas, New York, ‘the rest’ of the USA, Toronto, and‘the rest’ of Canada. Chicago, New York and Toronto are obvi-ously clearly defined centres and require no explanation. TheCalifornia sample is based mainly on Los Angeles, both the Parsiand the Iranian groups there, but there were some responses alsofrom San Francisco, which were almost all Iranian. The othersmaller Associations were put together because they shared a sim-ilar experience in seeking to preserve their tradition and culturewithout the aid of a physical centre, and living in small scatteredZoroastrians in the USA and Canada44358As with all sections relating to the survey, I must again record my profound gratitudeto Gillian Towler Mehta and family for making the survey possible. In this chapter in par-ticular their own experience of living in America for years was especially useful in identi-fying trends and patterns, though the fault for any failing remains, of course, my own.59In the commentary on the collected data, I am aware of the useful survey providedby the Association in British Columbia for the Fourth World Zoroastrian Congress inBombay, and I have visited Vancouver three times subsequent to the survey."},{"pageNumber":463,"pageContent":"groups. However, as these divisions of the material were tested,one Association stood out, for reasons that will become apparent:Houston is dealt with separately even though at the time of the sur-vey it was not a centre with a physical building. The tables onwhich the following summaries are based are given in Appendix 2.The overview here, it is hoped, will aid understanding.California apart, it can be seen from Appendix 2, Table 1 thatIranian Zoroastrians represented under 12% of the Zoroastrianpopulation at the time of the survey, though for the reasons given itmay be assumed that there were more in New York and Vancouverthan these figures indicate. The figures for those born ‘in the West’(see Appendix 2, Table 3) indicate that overall in the 1980s theZoroastrian population on the continent was of the first generation,with the majority coming from India. In the US there were relat-ively few Zoroastrians from East Africa, but there was a higher pro-portion in Canada. Houston alone had a substantial proportionfrom Pakistan, a distinctive feature to which we shall return. Insome areas, New York, the ‘rest’ of the US and in Canada, therewas clearly some onward migration from Britain. The TorontoAssociation (more correctly the Zoroastrian Society of Ontario) wassomewhat more mixed than others were, and had a separate organ-ization, the Iranian Zoroastrian Cultural Kanoun.60Table 1:1–2 in Appendix 2 shows how, in contrast to Britain,very few respondents settled in the West before the 1960s.Whatever the dates of the establishment of Associations, the cen-tres people moved to in any numbers in the 1960s were Chicago,Toronto, and the rest of Canada (some to the rest of the USA). Inthe 1970s all Associations grew significantly, especially California,New York, and ‘the rest’ of the US. In the 1980s the main growthwas in Houston and California. If one takes as a general principlethat variations between groups of less than 10% are not signific-ant (using the term in a general not a technical sense), then therewere no significant differences of age structures between NorthAmerican Associations—10–20% were under the age of 30, 60%were in their thirties and forties, and only 5–10% were in theirsixties and over. In comparison to the age range of the BritishZoroastrians in the USA and Canada44460My survey elicited few responses from Iranian Zoroastrians in Toronto. This, I wastold, was because in the mid-1980s they were very cautious about personal details beingpublished in view of the situation in Iran."},{"pageNumber":464,"pageContent":"Zoroastrians and especially in contrast to the Bombay Parsis, thisconstituted a very young population. Generally (Table 1: 4) therewas a slight preponderance of males across the continent, less than20% of respondents were single, and, despite some of the debatesto be discussed below, intermarriage was relatively low—under20% were married out and two-thirds were part of an extendedfamily. In the scattered groups in the USA and Canada as inBritain, however, there was a greater proportion of males, of singlepeople, and of intermarrieds (see Appendix 2, Table 1: 3–6). Thefigures suggest that it was young single males who migrated to the scattered groups, whereas the in-marrieds tended to settle wherethere was an Association. One may presume that living away fromAssociations limits the opportunities of marrying within the com-munity and that is why intermarriage occured more often in thescattered groups. There was a tendency towards nuclear families inToronto and Canada, and extended families in Chicago, Houstonand New York. California appeared to have a higher proportion ofsingle people with no extended family in the region.Table 1: 12 in Appendix 2 shows that of those in employment, themajority were in managerial or executive class employment. In theolder US centres in particular (Chicago, New York and the ‘rest’ ofAmerica), approximately 50% were in executive-class employment,compared with one-third in Canada. Table 1: 13–15 shows that, ininternational perspective, American and Canadian Zoroastrianskept in touch with fellow Zoroastrians both in the old country and‘here’, and read Zoroastrian literature, more than did BritishZoroastrians. But there were differences between AmericanAssociations. More Californian respondents said that they had moreregular contact with Zoroastrians locally than did most other groups.In the ‘rest of America’ fewer respondents were in touch withZoroastrians ‘here’, presumably because of the distances. Therewere wide differences between the groups on reading Zoroastrian lit-erature; for example, only 26% did so in Houston compared with60% in California. It is perhaps significant that the figures are higherwhere there is a well-established newsletter, which there was inCalifornia, but not in Houston, when this survey was conducted. Ifthat explanation is correct, the newsletters clearly serve as an import-ant means of Zoroastrian communication. Table 1: 22–31 inAppendix 2 suggests that in general respondents in Toronto andCanada inclined somewhat more towards Orthodoxy than people inZoroastrians in the USA and Canada445"},{"pageNumber":465,"pageContent":"the USA did, both in their own assessment and in their beliefs andpractices. Within the USA more people in Chicago and New Yorkdescribed themselves as Liberal, and this was reflected in their beliefsand practices associated with funerals, intermarriage, permittingnon-Zoroastrians into their prayer rooms and their beliefs concern-ing prayers for the dead. These centres contrasted with respondentsfrom Houston and California in particular. There was a differentpattern in higher education between USA and the other westerncountries, in that more of their people had pursued postgraduatestudies in America, whereas a number in Britain and Canada hadpursued such studies in India. How these characteristics impact onreligious belief and practice will be discussed later. First, a brief his-tory of Zoroastrians on the continent is appropriate.The earliest settlers: pre-1965Probably the earliest Parsi contacts with the North American con-tinent came through trade between Boston (Salem) and Bombay.The first such contact dates from 1799, when Nichols relates thathe conducted his business with ‘Parsees, some of the most intelli-gent people I have ever known, rich and honourable in their deal-ings’.61The first Parsi known to have visited Salem for tradeappears in a 1937 autobiography of Caroline Howard, whorecalls the visit of an unnamed Parsi to her home. She writes, ‘Iremember that we all screamed at him and spoke very distinctly,as if we were talking to a child, and that he answered us in a verylow cultivated refined voice, using much better English than wedid!’ She comments that he was returning to India after a six-yearabsence during which he had studied at Oxford, and over tea ‘toldus many interesting things of his life in Bombay’.62There was acase of what might be described as an ‘eccentric’ Zoroastrian inArizona in 1869. Charles Poston from Arizona visited Bombay in1869 and claims he was converted to Zoroastrianism and initiated.Zoroastrians in the USA and Canada44661M.

He befriended the Americanconsul in Bombay, Edward Ely, who when he fell ill and returnedto America in 1852 appointed Merwanji ‘to act in my name asVice-Consul of the United States at Bombay, I’m holding myselfresponsible for all his acts and fidelity’. He wrote to the AmericanSecretary of State, Daniel Webster, ‘In the absence of Americansat this place I have preferred him [ Merwanji] to any English mer-chant resident.’65Chandrasekhar then states that in 1888 anotherParsi, Hormusji E.

These merchants arenot known other than from this letter and so it is impossible to sayif there was a serious plan for such a migration to take place fromBaroda, but in view of those to China and East Africa it is not sur-prising that such a mercantile venture to America was considered.The first person to have produced a general account of Zoroastrianarrivals on the continent is the late Vancouver-based Parsi JamshedPavri, and an excellent compilation of the stories of Zoroastrians inUSA and Canada from the earliest times through to the 1960s hasbeen written by Roshan Rivetna.67The earliest person known tohave moved to America was Maneckji F. Javeri, who prospected forgold in California in the 1860s. A little more is known of Pestonji F. Davar, who came from Bombay and Hong Kong in 1892. He set-tled in San Francisco and became a millionaire. On his death he leftmuch of his estate to the Bombay Parsi Punchayet. His son, how-ever, converted to Christianity and left his money to the church.As a member of an isolated Zoroastrian family, he evidently foundit impossible to maintain his religious traditions and, as a second-generation American leaving the community, he represents anarchetypal pattern that many Zoroastrians fear. In 1904 Phiroze D. Saklatvalla moved to New York to represent the Parsi industrialgiants, the Tatas. Unlike his brother who became an MP inEngland, Phiroze succeeded in business, becoming known as the‘oil king’. A vivid picture of Saklatvalla’s wealth and splendidlifestyle is to be found in the memories of another early Parsi settleron the continent, Rustomji Wadia. He came to America as anengineer but lost his job in the Depression and bought a flourishingIndian restaurant, the Rajah, near Times Square in mid-townManhattan. This became the meeting place for the few Zoroastrianswho lived there and for those passing through.68Saklatvalla, Wadia,Pheroze Lashkeri (who worked for Ford) and Behram Saklatvalla,Zoroastrians in the USA and Canada44967See J. Pavri’s address to the Montreal Congress, ‘Contributions of Zoroastrians to theNorth American Society’, in The Zoroastrian Challenge in North America, Proceedings of the FourthNorth American Congress, 1983, pp. 88–94;Parsiana, Jan. 1976, pp. 23–7, and also theFEZANA Journal, Spring 1997, pp. 26–8.

Another early settler was Nasli Heeramaneck, who is saidto have come with 75 cents in his pocket but became a famous artcollector with splendid collections of Indian, Nepali and Tibetanmaterials; these were eventually acquired by the County Museum ofArt of Los Angeles. The Association was started on the suggestionof Dastur Dhalla when he revisited New York, where he had livedduring his postgraduate studies in 1905–9.69Intermarriage wasalmost inevitable in this fledgling community. The resident mem-bers were very supportive of Lashkeri when he announced hisengagement to a non-Zoroastrian, but Dhalla declined to be pres-ent and bless the proceedings. Lashkeri was so distraught that he committed suicide before the wedding.70The strictness of the so-called ‘Protestant Dastur’ was rarely commented on, but in someways he was indeed strict, for he had also declined to perform theBellanaujotein Rangoon. The Association died with its founder,Phiroze Saklatwalla, in 1934, though ‘Association’ is a rather grandtitle for such a small group. It was also something of a prototype oflater settlement patterns distinctive ofNorth AmericanZoroastrians, involving the bureaucratic concern to institutionalize,or formalize, groups and activities. This early group, with its mil-lionaires, reinforced the image of America as a land of opportunity.After the Immigration Act of 1917, Asians were banned fromentering America. Consequently the Zoroastrians who did comewere students, and there was the occasional passing businessman.Their meeting place was usually Mr Wadia’s restaurant. Pavri notesthree Parsis who successfully opposed the cancelling of their citizen-ship papers by the authorities: Bulsara, Wadia and Dinshaw P. F. Ghadiali. Ghadiali had started out as an electrician, indeed hadtwo patents to his name. After an initial visit to the US to meet Edisonin 1896, he settled there in 1911 and became a professor at theNew York College of Engineering. He joined the army and becamea commander in the New York Police Reserve Air Force PioneersWing. He was honoured with the Liberty Medal for his war servicesand was asked to lead the Wing in the 1919 Independence DayParade.

A. Sethnain 1913, the Jahanian brothers in 1916, and F. S. Bamji in 1935—all for engineering. Pavri notes several instances of distinguishedZoroastrians who came in the fractionally easier immigration cli-mate of the 1940s. These include Meherwan C. Irani consultantand innovative mining engineer; Rustomji Bana, distinguishedarchitect; Jehangir N. Badhni, sometime Chief Engineer of theIranian Government; Mehraban Zarthoshty, who started in theimport-export trade and became a successful business man and isnow an important philanthropist; and Kaikhosrov Irani, who cameas a physicist and later became Professor of Philosophy at the CityCollege of New York. Homi Engineer, who had achieved high mil-itary office before becoming Senior Surveyor for North India,arrived in Vancouver in 1957, where he was joined a year later bythe Pavris.72Mehli Mehta moved to Philadelphia in 1959 as a vio-linist and two years later his son, Zubin, came as the MusicalDirector of the Montreal Symphony Orchestra. His brother, Zarin,had already settled in Montreal as an accountant. Zubin moved toLos Angeles in 1962 and eventually to the New York Philharmonicin 1978.73He, too, is a person who will re-emerge in the history ofZoroastrians on the North American continent. Prior to 1965,therefore, a few outstanding individuals came for specific posts or asstudents.

He was not successful, despite his long-standing asso-ciation with, and prominent position in, the Sun Life AssuranceCompany of Canada. A number of Parsis studied at TorontoUniversity from 1922 (when Shiavax Nawroji studied dentistry). Inthe early 1960s students such as Dara Dastur, Keki Bharucha andBoman Ghadiali came, and they were the first to obtain immigrantlanded status. They established ‘the Zoroastrian fraternity’ inToronto in 1966. A number of important future leaders also camebefore the crucial year of 1965 namely Jehangir (Paymaster)Medora (1946), Keki Bhote (1948), Dr Jehan Bagli, Sam Tata(1956), Eruch Munshi (1957), Dr Rustom Sarfeh, Jamshed Pavri,Dr Shahriar Mehrabi (1958), Dr Lovji Cama,75and Dr JamshedMavalwalla (1960). Some of these very early settlers encounteredreal problems of loneliness and isolation, far from home with fewco-religionists and no effective support networks.76Many of theseearly arrivals became prominent leaders among North AmericanZoroastrians in the 1980s and 1990s.Migration studies commonly neglect to bring out the serious difficulties faced by settlers, including a lack of money. One now well-known and established family laughingly told me of their first days inthe US with about $10 between them for food and lodging, half ofwhich the husband gave to a young American in need. Anotherrelated how he sat on a wall wondering how to get started. He sawan American in difficulties, helped him and was promptly given ajob. The need to meet fellow Zoroastrians was real, but there wereso few. Once groups began to form, although always small com-pared to other Asian groups, proportionately they grew quickly. Forexample, the membership lists at Houston (one of the groupsestablished later) show 148 people in 1979 (including 51 children),187 in 1981 (with 62 children) and 218 in 1982 (including 72 chil-dren); this represents a growth of one-third in three years, but itwas still only a small number of adults to build a ‘community’.North America was a daunting prospect to many of the new settlers who came alone.Zoroastrians in the USA and Canada45275I am grateful to Dr and Mrs Cama for making me a welcome guest in their home.76FEZANA Journal, Spring 1997, pp. 39, 46, 48 f."},{"pageNumber":472,"pageContent":"The settlement years, 1965–1990The pioneersPavri’s Directory of Zoroastrians in North America, produced in December1965, lists 291 adults and 79 children. Of the adults 158 (54%) weresingle and 37 (13%) intermarried. They were located mainly inOntario (52 adults); California (50 adults); New York (46 adults) andQuebec (28 adults). Those numbers grew dramatically. It quicklybecame easy to migrate to Canada, because two residentZoroastrians, Jehangir (Paymaster) Medora77and Jamshed Pavripersuaded a Mr Nigosian of the immigration department and a Mr Delaney, head of the immigration service in Toronto, that theParsis were people with exceptionally high educational achieve-ments. In conjunction with a travel agent in Bombay a system wasset up whereby (I am assured by individuals who did this) one couldapply to migrate in the morning and be on the evening flight thesame day. The earliest informal Associations were in Montreal,Vancouver and Chicago in 1965–8; the first informal Association inToronto was started in 1966. The first community letter that I havebeen able to trace was started in Chicago on 1 June 1966 andpresented itself as the production of the ‘Zoroastrian Association of America’.78The first paragraph sets the tone of many papers to come:The Zoroastrian population in the United States and Canada is alreadythe fourth largest Zoroastrian community in the world—next only toIndia, Iran and Pakistan. With the liberalizing of immigration laws inboth the United States and Canada, the lure that the New World holdsfor Parsis abroad, it is not inconceivable that by the end of this centurythe Zoroastrian community in North America will jump to secondplace. It is time, therefore, for those of us in the vanguard of this migra-tion, to plan on ways and means to preserve our identity and our her-itage, while participating fully in the American way of life.The Zoroastrian community in Vancouver quickly protested atthis claim to represent all American Zoroastrians. Their pioneer-ing families, the Engineers and Pavris, had drafted a constitutionZoroastrians in the USA and Canada45377His story is told by Roshan Rivetna in FEZANA Journal, Summer 1997, pp. 44 f.

This can be a sensitive mat-ter in any minority community especially if its members feelrestricted in outside opportunities. Leadership has been a matterof lively, and bitter, debate at various stages of AmericanZoroastrian history. On the other hand the role of leader is impor-tant, because the role of an individual here can have greaterimpact than in a larger body. In this instance, there was, in theopinion of Bhote, a need for a co-ordinated movement across thecontinent, because the resources available to individual groupswere inadequate to meet the needs that were foreseen. This was afact later recognized in Vancouver.80Bhote and others continuedthe campaign for a national body over many years until it emergedin 1986–7. The quotation from the newsletter contains two otherissues, which have continued to be at the forefront of communitydebate and will be recurring themes in this chapter. The first is theconviction that a significant part of future Zoroastrian history willbe in America. This sense of confidence and assertiveness in theZoroastrian world is real. For example, Lovji Cama of New Yorkdeclared in his paper to the 1977 Congress in Chicago: ‘We are ina somewhat similar situation to what it must have been 1,300years ago when our ancestors came to India...I believe that thebest of the community has been brought here by a divine plan.’As we shall see below, in the years of consolidation and growth ofthe 1990s, that American leadership was more often and explicitlyhighlighted.The second feature of the quotation that merits highlighting,because of its prophetic nature, is the awareness of the need tobalance the faithful preservation of identity, heritage and customswith the wish to participate fully in American life. This has beenthe underlying theme of successive North American Zoroastrianconferences, papers and study groups, and is the basic issueunderlying much of the rest of this chapter. One example: the1985 North American Zoroastrian Conference in Los Angeleswas entitled: ‘The Preservation of Zoroastrian Identity throughAdoption to Changing Environments’.

The largest Associations are Toronto (5,000-plus)Vancouver (1,500-plus) and the various Californian groups whichtogether total approximately 2,500.82The figures do, however,require some caution. As a general rule of thumb, mostZoroastrian bodies estimate how many Zoroastrians are known tolive in the region and then double that figure because of the num-ber of people not in contact with an Association. Some of theAssociation address lists do not have full records, because manypeople do not want their addresses and details published. In theprivacy and anonymity of the 1991 Canadian census, fewer people recorded themselves as Zoroastrian than the Associations’figures would lead one to expect. The total figure for the whole ofCanada was 3,185 (1,620 M., 1,565 F.).

Another FarsiPublication—in both Farsi and English—is published fromVancouver:Iran Zamin, edited by Fariborz Rahnamoon, availablealso on his website www.ancientiran.com, it was started somewhatlater, in 2000. In the later 1990s, the production of the excellentjournal of the national body, FEZANA, meant that the othernewsletters became more conventional, with news of local upcom-ing events, achievements of members, meetings, funds, etc. This is,of course, a vital function for the majority of Zoroastrians acrossthe continent, because their primary focus is on meeting with co-religionists for religious or social functions and not with broadnational and international issues. Although containing much localinformation, these newsletters were originally seen as having a widernational role, as networks across the continent, indeed back to theold country, for copies were often sent to Parsianaand major eventswere reported in that magazine. In one sense the Federation Newsletter(see Chapter 2 above) followed the American development.84The only ‘circulars’ not to have news but to focus exclusively on reli-gious matter are Jafarey’s (Reforming) The Zoroastrian(later replacedby Spenta) and another Californian, but doctrinally diametricallyopposed, religious circular the Mazdayasni Connection, produced bySilloo and Fali Mehta, which communicates Khshnoomic teaching,especially that of Adi Doctor (see Chapter 2).85There have beentwo other Zoroastrian media organizations in this period. The firstis the Zoroastrian Foundation, which had links with Bombay butwhose main, or only, product is a lavishly produced book,In Searchof My God, published anonymously in 1978. The other is PersepolisProductions, a body set up to launch a film featuring Zubin Mehta’sZoroastrians in the USA and Canada45984The newsletter networks were commented on in Parsiana, May 1981, p. 7. It quoteda statement ofGavashni, ‘The opening up of a source of dialogue between our scatteredcommunities...we consider as a first necessary step for our survival as a separate ethniccommunity.’85I wish to express my gratitude to Mr and Mrs Mehta for making me so welcome intheir home, and for sending me their journal."},{"pageNumber":479,"pageContent":"Zoroastrians in the USA and Canada460"},{"pageNumber":480,"pageContent":"Zoroastrians in the USA and Canada461Zarathushti Presence in North AmericaTaken with kind permission of the editor, Roshan Rivetna, from the FEZANA Journal SpecialCommemorative Issue, Winter 2000, pp. 84 ff."},{"pageNumber":481,"pageContent":"quest for his roots, an ‘epic’ in more than one sense, which will bediscussed below.Buildings have been opened in New York (1977), Toronto (1980),Chicago (1983), Los Angeles (1980, moving to new, purpose-builtpremises in 1986); San José (1986); Vancouver (1986); Washington(1990); and Houston (1997). It is not easy for someone from themajority society to appreciate how vital these are for members of aminority group in the modern West. One young Zoroastrian inToronto once commented to me, ‘Every day I am in a multiculturalenvironment at school. I want one place to go where I can be myself.’In Hong Kong, East Africa and Sind, as we have seen, the Parsiswere quick to establish social-cum-religious centres. The centre hasa dual function: it is a place where Zoroastrians can meet, mingle,network, so providing not simply enjoyable social occasions, but also mutual support; further, it facilitates meetings between youngpeople. But Zoroastrians also need a place apart for the practice ofthe religion. The prayer rooms in the West are not fully consecratedtemples, unlike those in Sind and Zanzibar, and so do not need theservices of a full-time priest, but they acquire a sense of holinesswhen prayers and religious ceremonies are practised there for years.How these issues are worked out will be discussed below. Here thefocus is on the establishment of organizations and institutions.The story of these buildings is an important part of NorthAmerican Zoroastrian history. In each case the raising of funds hasbeen a problem because the numbers are small, and the costs arehigh. To compound the difficulties, the American work ethic andhigh living costs mean that the young married people (the peoplewith perhaps the greatest interest in such a provision because oftheir children), both husband and wife, have to work extremely hardto survive in America. They have little spare time, or money, to sup-port the venture. Some of the leaders also lament the loss of the tra-dition of collective giving in the community, fearing that the historyof great benefactors has eroded the individual’s sense of responsi-bility to the community. The Chicago building is something of anexception in this history, because it is the only one which was phys-ically built by the toil of members’ own hands. This has produceda special bond between the people and the structure.86Zoroastrians in the USA and Canada46286See the booklet,Inauguration of the Arbab Rustom Guiv Darbe Mehr Zoroastrian Centre ofChicago, Chicago, 1983."},{"pageNumber":482,"pageContent":"Each building opened in this period depended to a greater orlesser degree on funds from Arbab Rustom Guiv and his Trust.The debate has been along the same lines in each case, but wasperhaps at its most acute with the first building, the one in New York.The focus of the debate was the ownership of the property.ZAGNY believed that the late Arbab Rustom Guiv had given theproperty to ZAGNY, and that therefore they were the rightfulowners. The chairman of the Guiv Trust, Dr Rustom Sarfeh,believed that the ultimate ownership belonged with the Trusts,who leased the property to the Association at a peppercorn rent,but that the affairs of the property—as distinct from the generalaffairs of the Association—should be run by a special board oftrustees, half appointed by the Trust, half by the Association. Thedebate was complicated by two further elements. One was a per-sonality clash. Dr Sarfeh was a forceful personality. While out-wardly courteous, he was inclined to be scathing and personal inhis criticisms. A third factor was the Iranian–Parsi divide. This ulti-mately led to the establishment of a separate Iranian Association(see below). Sarfeh stated that as the money for the building wasIranian money, Iranians should have the majority voice amongthe building’s Trustees. There were protracted negotiations toseek a mutually acceptable arrangement and when the final pro-posal was overwhelmingly rejected by a general meeting ofZAGNY, the matter went to court, where the judge found infavour of ZAGNY. The implications of this for Zoroastrian rela-tions in New York will be discussed below; the significance here isthat as a result of this disagreement, the Guiv Trusts hereaftertook great pains to ensure that their terms were agreed inadvance: the Trusts’ ownership of the buildings; the compositionof the board of the trustees; and various details such as the nam-ing of a centre after Guiv. Guiv also insisted that the buildingsbe termed Darbe Mehr (not the traditional Dar-i Mihr), which heinterpreted as ‘the door of love’. He made it clear that heexpected anyone to be welcomed into the building, Zoroastrian ornot. The first Association to be so affected was Toronto. The vari-ous Associations have sought to raise funds themselves, and therehave been other substantial benefactors, notably Mehraban andFaridoon Zartoshty, but in each case, both on the North Americancontinent and in Australia, a sizeable proportion of the money hascome from the Guiv Trusts.Zoroastrians in the USA and Canada463"},{"pageNumber":483,"pageContent":"Key benefactorsIn view of this central role played by Guiv in the growth of DarbeMehrs on the American continent, it is appropriate to give a briefaccount of Guiv at this point.87Rustom Behman Guiv (Arbab is anhonorific title) was born in Yazd in 1888, the son of a modest busi-nessman who dealt in cloth. He attended school in Yazd, but at theage of 20 undertook the long and hazardous mule ride to Tehran,where he and his brothers flourished in the import and exportbusiness. They moved into real estate and he bought land in twoareas to the north of Tehran, known as Rustamabad, which hetransformed into fertile agricultural land—producing fruits andgrain for export. From 1933 he was active in the Tehran ZoroastrianAnjuman and in 1940 he succeeded Keikhosrow Shahrokh asPresident. He gave some of his land to the Anjuman and its salesolved their financial difficulties. Two years later he was elected rep-resentative of the Zoroastrians in the Iranian Parliament (Majlis). In1953 he visited Bombay and was greatly impressed by the housingcolonies, especially Cusrow Baug, and so with members of the Taftiand Aresh families developed Tehran-Pars, a colony in garden-likesurroundings north of Tehran, for poor and low-incomeZoroastrians. He sold his home, giving the funds to the Anjuman,and went to live in the colony. He also funded boys’ and girls’ schoolsin Tehran. In 1960 he started a factory in Tehran. What he is mostremembered for, however, is his work for the Anjuman, serving aspresident for twenty-seven years, and his work in Parliament for fiveconsecutive terms of office, until the Shah excluded him on thegrounds that he had served long enough, and made him a senator.He is known above all as a great philanthropist. He turned his atten-tion to the needs in America as a result of the advice of his friendand guide, Dr Rustom Sarfeh, and Professor Farhang Mehr,formally Vice-Chancellor of Shiraz University (discussed below).

After the Iranianrevolution, Iranian passport holders were not readmitted to the USif they left, so he could not travel from his new home in Californiato Toronto. From 1978 he contemplated turning his investmentstowards housing for poor Zoroastrians in Bombay, and had his visaZoroastrians in the USA and Canada46487The following account is based on a cyclostyled four-page tribute produced by theindefatigable late Jamshed Pavri of Vancouver in 1980.

But he remainedin America, giving $150,000 to Chicago, and $108,000 to theZoroastrian Center in California. After the New York disagreement,he thereafter leased the properties to the Associations for ninety-nineyears at $1.00 per year. He died in 1980. His wife, Morvarid, was apowerful support in his charitable work, both during his life and afterhis death. A Trust Body in California and a Foundation in New York,which dispense the funds, manage his estate.88The Rustom GuivFoundation was established on 4 February 1980 naming JamshidGuiv, Rostam Sarfeh, Shari Merabi, B. Kaviyani, Farokh Patel andMorvarid Guiv as trustees. The income of the ‘estate’ was ‘for reli-gious purposes’, for ‘groups or organisations engaged in the practiceand advance of the Zoroastrian religion’. The trustees were givenfull discretion, save only that tax laws must not be contravened, normust any individual person benefit. The trustees can act on a major-ity decision. When one trustee’s term ends, then the other trusteescan replace that person. Although they have funded the purchase ofburial plots in California and Chicago, and aided a mobed studyfund, the money has been targeted at Zoroastrian buildings in thediaspora.Two other important benefactors, in America, but also globally,are Mehraban Zartoshty and his brother Faridoon. Donations inthe Zartoshty name have always been given in the name of bothbrothers, for as Mehraban put it, on his brother’s death in 2000,‘we were one soul inhabiting two bodies’. Their father had taughtthem that in business they should always allocate a fixed propor-tion of their profits to charity. It is this regular contribution whichhas built the substantial charity fund from which they have given.Mehraban is the brother best known in the West, for he settled firstin Britain, then in Canada and spends much of his time with hisfamily in California. The brothers were born in Yazd. Mehrabanwent to Bombay to matriculate. His original intention had been tostudy Medicine but he entered the family business. In 1948 hewent to the USA to study Business Administration, and returned tothe family business in Iran, until the revolution. The Zartoshtybrothers have given substantial sums to centres in America, Britain(see Chapter 7), India,89and Australia (see Chapter 9).

In 1990 Mehraban gave a rareinterview, in which this quiet and self-effacing Iranian benefactordiscouraged debate on controversial issues at a forthcoming con-gress. He said that he would accept the families of intermarriedZoroastrians, but wanted to encourage Zoroastrian family life andlarger families. He is a mobed, and serves as president of the NorthAmerican Iranian mobeds (Kankash-e-Mobedan), but he rarelyofficiates in ceremonies, though he did perform the naujoteof hisgrandsons. His religion is a key part of his life; he and his brotherhave funded the management of the Atash Bahram in Yazd for thelast thirty years. His benefactions have not caused the controversiesthat have been associated with the Guiv Trusts, because he himselfrarely attaches conditions, but negotiates quietly and directly himself—and I can vouchsafe as one who has negotiated with Mr Zarthoshty, that it is done in a quiet and gentle manner.CongressesA different, but important, means of networking, as well asnewsletters, has been a series of North American Zoroastriancongresses. Those held in this period were in Toronto (1975);Chicago (1977); New York (1979); Montreal (1982); Los Angeles(1985); Toronto (1988); Houston (1990).90The proceedings offour of the first six were published, the exceptions being those inNew York and Los Angeles. The choice of topics, and especiallyof speakers, can be a highly controversial matter because of thesignificance for the balance of views represented, so the 1985 LAcongress was, then and later, seen to have had a strongly reform-ing steer. The Montreal Congress was important because of theissues which arose there, in particular concerning conversion, aswe shall see below. The positive side of the congresses has beentheir role in bringing together Zoroastrians who live thousands ofmiles apart and who would otherwise probably not meet. Theyouth programme has been particularly important in this regard.But a general concern about the congresses was that because eachZoroastrians in the USA and Canada46690Beyond the period under discussion, congresses have also been held at Vancouver(1992), San Francisco (1996), New York (1998); Houston (2000); Chicago (2002)."},{"pageNumber":486,"pageContent":"was organized by a different local Association, there was noongoing administration or activity between meetings. Further, assome Associations sought to inspire people with their view ontopics previously discussed, there was a feeling that they rehearsedthe same old issues—and arguments. The result was that collectivepolicies did not emerge.An ‘umbrella’ organizationThe proposal for an overarching body was first made by Bhote, at ameeting of the Zoroastrians in Vancouver.91The establishment ofsuch a body was listed as the first goal of the Chicago Symposium(1977,Proceedings, pp. 1 f.) and Jehan Bagli, of Montreal, wascharged with the responsibility for drawing up proposals. In aletter dated 19 November 1979 to the president of the ThirdSymposium, Bagli stated that the groundwork had been done andproposals had been formulated. But responses from manyAssociations were simply not forthcoming. In 1980 Dr Bagliresigned from this responsibility. The work was taken over byDr Lovji Cama from New York. Again the responses were limited.One problem for the delegates was attending meetings across suchvast distances. Many felt that the ideals were impractical. But at adeeper level, suspicion lingered, especially among the traditionalgroups, that a national body might seek to impose changes thatwould be unacceptable locally. At the Los Angeles Congress in1985 the establishment of such a body was blocked in the dele-gates’ meeting, but reopened on the floor of the congress whenthe Chicago president, a popular figure, Rohinton Rivetna, wasasked to draft a constitution for a national body.92This he did andfurther convened a ‘constitutional convention’ in Chicago in May1986. Subsequently, consensus was reached on the constitution ofthe Federation of Zoroastrians in North America (FEZANA), andall existing Associations (then numbering sixteen) were signatoriesto it. And so the dream of an overarching two-nation bodybecame a reality. Rivetna was elected its first president. FEZANAmarks the start of the third stage of Zoroastrian history in NorthAmerica, one of collaboration in the growth and establishment ofZoroastrianism. Its elected officers have no powers; all decisionsZoroastrians in the USA and Canada46791See minutes of meeting for 8 Oct. 1967, Pavri,ZSBC,p.24.92FEZANA Journal, Summer 1996, p. 30."},{"pageNumber":487,"pageContent":"lie with the committees. Its highly successful journal became animportant primary source for the history of North AmericanZoroastrians and will be studied below. It will hereafter be referredto simply as Journal. How FEZANA developed in the 1990s will bediscussed in in the section on the 1990s, below.Religious Issues among American Zoroastrians in the Settlement YearsChange and continuityPerhaps the fundamental issue facing the different communitiesacross the continent is the question of adaptation to American life:how far must this go if the religion is to be meaningful to peoplewho live in the New World, rather than in India or Iran, and to theyoung in particular? Or is change impossible if continuity, indeedthe essence, of the tradition and of identity is to be preserved?The issue emerged in particular in relation to the formal practices,notably the rites and ceremonies, for these are a formal enactmentof the tradition. It was identified at the first meeting of UZANA(the short-lived precursor to FEZANA) on 7 October 1978; specif-ically, point 6 of the agreement drawn up at that meeting washeaded ‘Adaptation of Code Changes to suit the SocialEnvironment of this Continent’. The paragraph reads:It was agreed by all that this would be a slow process as change wasfrightening, but we should get uniformity of action across the continentand performances and practices of certain religious ceremonies in non-traditional ways should become acceptable to all of the community.Some degree of change is inevitable, because nowhere in theNew World is there a fully consecrated temple as required for thehigher rituals, nor is there a dokhmafor the traditional funeralceremonies.93There is also a problem involving the priests. FewIndian and only one Iranian priest have migrated to the NewWorld in order to function as full-time priests. The people who actare mostly those of a priestly lineage who had the basic priestlyZoroastrians in the USA and Canada46893See L. Cama’s speech to the Third World Zoroastrian Congress in Bombay, 1978,p. 4. Similarly Mavalwala at the Toronto North American Zoroastrian Congressquestioned the applicability of purity laws associated with childbirth, even when rationalizedas hygiene rules, in a modern hospital (p. 45)."},{"pageNumber":488,"pageContent":"initiation (navar, and sometimes maratab) in childhood in order topreserve the lineage but who did not expect to function as priestswhen they migrated. They moved to the New World for a secularcareer, and in view of the paucity of priests, were asked to per-form as priests and spiritual guides, even though these were roleswhich they had never envisaged undertaking. As one put it: ‘WhenI arrived in the US five years ago I had not the slightest idea thatshortly I would be asked to perform the duties of a priest in addi-tion to my regular job as an accountant.’94Such priests naturallyhad not been schooled in the intricate details of the liturgies.Many foresaw the danger of priests performing the rituals differ-ently in various centres, especially as there was pressure from vari-ous sources, not only the young, for the lengthy, complex rituals tobe shortened, and modified, to make them more meaningful ina new environment. So, for example, Rivetna in a speech at theMontreal Congress in 1982 said:we need standard procedures for the performance of ceremoniesadapted to the North American environment. These include Navjoteand wedding ceremonies, jashans, gahambars, muktad and otherceremonies....we need recommendations on ways and means of ordaining anew breed of priests on this continent; we cannot indefinitely depend ongetting priests from India and Iran...We, the laity, who most often end up running the Association, tend toforget the spiritual and religious needs of the community. We shouldstrive to elevate our priests to a stature where we can turn over the helmto them. To cope with this duty, we require a new breed of priests,priests that not only perform ceremonies, but who would also impartreligious knowledge, fill the spiritual void in our religious lives, andguide the course of our religion on this continent.95In order to avoid unilateral actions, and achieve some co-ordinated thought and practice, a national meeting of priests was organized by one of the Toronto priests, Kobad Zarolia (26 November 1983). The report of the meeting was circulated toall Associations and to all known practising priests. It dealt in par-ticular with naujoteand funeral ceremonies, and the training ofpriests. It envisaged the eventual initiation of adopted children,Zoroastrians in the USA and Canada46994See Pervez Patel, ‘West Side Story’,Parsiana, Nov. 1975, p. 22.95Proceedings, p. 118."},{"pageNumber":489,"pageContent":"spouses and any non-Zoroastrian who sought entry to the religion‘but only after a lot of community input and discussions. May be innext 100 years we may complete all the steps, or a few.’ Other issuesdiscussed included the use of sermons to provide religious instruc-tion, as provided in the wider Christian society; the consolidating ofIranian and Parsi ceremonies in a uniform pattern; and the funeralof a non-Zoroastrian spouse. The extent of the religious problemsencountered by Zoroastrians in the New World is well illustrated bythe problem of funerals. The difficulty is not simply the lack of adokhma. In the old country there are professionals who cater for thefuneral needs of families—people who know the purity laws, whocan take the corpse to the special places for its preparation, a teamof priests well versed in the proper ceremonies. In America, few ofthe priests officiated at funerals before migration; there is not time atan American funeral parlour to say the required prayers, there arenot the proper facilities and the families do not know what isexpected of them. The situation can be even worse because the hugedistances across the continent may mean there is not a priest of anysort available. Times of bereavement are times when any grievingperson is deeply concerned ‘to do the right thing’ for the departed.Such a range of problems can cause the deepest distress. In order tohelp the families the ZSO produced a leaflet in 1981 for people tokeep at home for such moments, and Montreal also produced one in1983; since then many Associations have done so.96The TorontoMobed’ Conference also considered the roles which the laity canundertake at funerals.97Various Associations have made arrange-ments with specific funeral parlours so that Zoroastrians wash thebody and dress it in a sudreandkusti,a divois lit at the head of thebody and the geh sarnaceremony is performed before Zoroastrianmen carry the body to the crematorium. Practices can, therefore, beevolved, but for the early settlers there were real problems.The importance and changing role of ceremonies was wellarticulated by one of the founding Toronto priests, Yezdi Antia, atthe 1985 North American Zoroastrian Congress in Los Angeles:Many among us believe that the practice of Zoroastrianism is riddledwith rituals. Perhaps it was true in India, especially in respect to cere-monies for our departed. In the west, however, this is no longer the case.Zoroastrians in the USA and Canada47096SeeParsiana, Mar. 1981, p.21.97Parsiana, Aug. 1984, p. 12. I am grateful to Yezdi for his hospitality."},{"pageNumber":490,"pageContent":"Rituals are the centre of our social life here. Naujote, Marriage, Deathand Jashan ceremonies are occasions for the community to gathertogether from miles around, to affirm our faith, and give visible and tan-gible sense of identity to our children. In our main cities, we are scatteredfar and wide and we need more, not fewer, rituals, for a purpose and anoccasion to meet together.The jashanis a part of the ancient tradition, and is still importantin both Iran and India. But it has acquired perhaps yet moreimportance in the diaspora. Even in the old country it is a ritewhich can be celebrated outside the temple, for example, in thehome. By the substitution of certain prayers it can be used as ablessing (e.g. for a new home), in thanksgiving, for example, aftervictory in war, to honour a new Dastur, in memory of thedeceased and in many other contexts. These various factors makeit especially appropriate as the centre of a communal meeting. Buteven this popular rite can be difficult, because traditionally itneeds more than one priest. However, the distance problemmeans that sometimes only one priest is available, so that somemodification of this especially popular liturgy is necessary. Thepriests are, therefore, conscious of the pressures for change. Butthey are also concerned about introducing changes that wouldalienate them from their fellow priests in the old country. Forexample, at a later Mobed Conference in Toronto (1989) therewas much discussion about the adoption of the Fasli calendar,because this is by design easier to integrate into the western cal-endar year than either of the other two used in the old country.But the mobeds were loath to take a unilateral decision that would dis-tance them from the practitioners of the religion in India to whom theylooked for guidance and help when the need arises. The mobeds simi-larly felt ill-equipped to abridge ceremonies like the jashan and gehsarna [funeral ceremony] and unanimously agreed to perform them inthe traditional way.98The senior priest in Chicago, Kersey Antia, a practising psy-chologist, raised at the 1982 Montreal Congress the question ofthe appropriate requirements for an American priesthood. Shouldit be hereditary? In a technologically advanced society, especiallyin a computer-orientated society, is the priestly memorization ofthe sacred text necessary, as it was among less literate people?Zoroastrians in the USA and Canada47198Parsiana, June 1989, p. 19."},{"pageNumber":491,"pageContent":"Since the higher ceremonies cannot be performed in the NewWorld, there is no point in the priests knowing how to performthem. Antia saw that future priests in America would need aknowledge of comparative religion (because of intermarriage andto counter propaganda) and psychology (for pastoral purposes),and experience to help them instruct and guide the young.99Inthe same year as the Toronto Mobed Conference, a fund wasstarted in Montreal to finance the training of AmericanZoroastrian boys of priestly families. The fund was launched inmemory of a young mobed, Parvez Kotwal, who was killed in anaccident.100What emerged as practice was that, prior to going toIndia for their priestly initiation, American Zoroastrians of apriestly family should study with their fathers and seek guidancefrom one of the elders, for example, Jehan Bagli in Montreal orKersey Antia in Chicago.101There are, therefore, various points at which some AmericanZoroastrians see change as both necessary and inevitable. But thatchange is seen as a threat by others. Many of my Zoroastrianfriends in North America, as well as elsewhere, have told me thatthey became more religious after migration than they were before,because religion is at the heart of identity and basic to communityties. They also commented that they practise their religion for thesake of their children. Although they migrated for a better life fortheir children, they are also very conscious of the threats and dan-gers of American society: the drug scene, sexual promiscuity,weaker family ties and easy divorce, so that the children for whomthey migrated seem to be also in danger. Pleas to the young toretain their heritage are impassioned. Dr Bahram Faradieh fromChicago put the problem thus at the Third World ZoroastrianCongress in Bombay in 1978: ‘We in the US unfortunately do nothave the luxury of time. Our children, who are mostly of animpressionable age now, are growing up fast’. Regarding theAmerican Zoroastrian community, he went on:We are spread so thin across this wide land and are so heavily exposedto western culture as broadcast through the media of communications—particularly television—that unless we take positive steps to prevent it,Zoroastrians in the USA and Canada47299Proceedings, pp. 147–51.100Gavashni, Dec. 1982.101Bagli and Adi Unwala have published a book for young priests on how to performceremonies."},{"pageNumber":492,"pageContent":"the retention of Zoroastrian identity in the New World will be lost.Perpetuation, Survival, Assimilation are connotations which are upper-most in our minds. Nowhere in the world are the social pressures to con-form as great as in the United States. Most of our adults who have beenbrought up in India and Iran have an innate mechanism to resist thesepressures; however, our children through their formative years are notequipped with such attitudes. Every one of you has heard the hackneyedphrase ‘United States is the melting pot of cultures.’To Zoroastrians in this part of the world this cliché portends thethreat of annihilation. Similarly, Eruch Munshi speaking to theToronto Congress after commenting that education, housing andhospitals are not the requirements in America that they are inIndia, said: ‘The requirement of identity is what concerns me, asfar as my children are concerned, and I think it concerns me farmore when I contemplate whether my grandchildren will remainZoroastrians, or be within the community.’102Jal Guzder, again atToronto (p. 60), expressed succinctly the particular problems ofsuch a small community, and spoke about the lack of communitycontact and loss of identity faced by many: ‘I come into contactwith Parsis maybe once a month...we don’t come home andparticipate in religious or Parsi activities...here we are all basi-cally individualistic, we are integrated, and we are subject to thehistorical forces of the “melting pot”.’ The emotional conse-quences of the perceived threat of change were stressed by anunnamed speaker at a small symposium in Toronto in 1983:‘some of us who have not yet emotionally adjusted to the changedenvironment of life in North America are experiencing grief athaving had to leave our lands of birth. Under these circum-stances, we want to cling on to the traditional, and do not want torecognise and accept change.’103The threat of change and consequent loss of identity is seen bymany as being far greater in America than elsewhere. Thus AdiDavar from Washington, a retired senior figure at the World Bankand therefore visibly successful in the West, said at the MontrealConference:India, or Pakistan or Burma, where, whether you like it or not, the reli-gious influences and cultural influences in these countries were based onthe principles of live and let live...But the country we now call home,Zoroastrians in the USA and Canada473102Proceedings,p.56.103Zoroastrian Society of Ontario,Newsletter, 1983, p. 4."},{"pageNumber":493,"pageContent":"and which our children and their children’s children will call home, is notsuch a live and let live culture. It is a culture which is based on the the-ory of melting pot. It is supposed to dissolve your older culture to meltit into a new culture which is uniquely Canadian and uniquelyAmerican. This is what our children are fighting against.104The same perception of threat to one’s identity was put forcefullyby Tahamton Aresh in an undated circular at the end of hisperiod as president of the California-based TraditionalMazdayasni Zoroastrian Association: ‘I strongly uphold the age-old traditions and practices of the Zoroastrian faith for it is clearto me that our religious legacy must be passed down intact to ourchildren for posterity. Let it not be said by historians of the futurethat in a matter of one generation we abandoned the heritage ofthousands of years.’105For some the threat of change has beenseen simply as something that must be accepted as inevitable. AsBehram Parsi expressed it at the Toronto Congress (p. 69): ‘In thenext two decades my daughter and your children will not accept thereligion as it has been handed down to us.’ Indeed, Mavalwalla,at the same Congress (p. 41) saw it as a present reality: ‘We maystill be Zoroastrians but we are no longer the same people whenwe live in Canada’. The threat of change is seen to be particularlyacute through intermarriage. But it would be wrong to assumethat pressures for change inevitably resulted in a ‘progressiveliberalization’. Some Orthodox voices remain strong, both onthe Internet as we shall see in Chapter 10 below, but also atconferences. For example, at the Seventh World Congress inHouston in 2000 a closely printed nineteen-page document waswidely circulated called ‘Welcome to Traditionalism’, coveringsuch issues as the language of prayer, the importance of ritualsand the wrongs of intermarriage.Intermarriage, community identity and conversionIn-marriage has been the norm among Zoroastrians in India andIran for at least a millennium, if not throughout history.

Whereintermarriage occurred in either country it typically caused seriousfamily and social problems, which thereby reinforced the norm.However, it is widely accepted among American Zoroastrians thatintermarriage is inevitable. Bagli said at the Toronto Conference:‘Sheer statistics of numbers of other communities in relation tothe number of non-Zoroastrians around can predict for us thatmany Zoroastrian youngsters will decide upon marital union witha non-Zoroastrian spouse. We must view this event as a naturalconsequence of being on this continent.’106From the perspective of the ‘old country’ this is seen as a direthreat. Thus, writing from India to the first Toronto MobedConference, Adi Doctor argued that the American Zoroastrians’first priority was to marry within the community. With such a goalin mind, various Associations have organized youth groups withdiscos, picnics, activity weekends and sleepovers, and put advertsin newsletters and magazines such as Parsianaand the FEZANAJournal. The time chart on pages 455–7 above indicates the grow-ing emphasis on youth activities, with ‘Zarathushti Olympics’ andyouth conferences. These have achieved some success: for example,Roshan Rivetna, who produces the matrimonial column in theJournal, estimates that there have been twenty to thirty marriagesarising from a decade of such advertisements.107But these,Pheroze Dastoor commented in 1982, are not likely to achievetheir object:The suggestions that Youth should be brainwashed to chooseZoroastrian life-partners and to ensure that youth meetings, picnics anddances should be encouraged is not a new idea. Together with advertis-ing in matrimonial columns and seeking help of ‘kaj-walli’ (matchmak-ers) has been an age-old Parsee India custom, obviously not a verysuccessful one nowadays. This would be harder to implement and couldbe less successful in [an] American context, what with eight to twelvehours per day of non-Zoroastrian influence in schools, colleges, clubs,socialising and working.

For example, a letter was publishedinGavashnifrom a 26-year-old Parsi woman whose attempts tofind a Zoroastrian partner proved fruitless, but she did find ahappy marriage with a Canadian who accepted her ardent wish topass on her religion to their children. The editor, Bagli, com-mended her commitment, but this provoked intense hostility inthe Indian press and from an American correspondent.109In thatyear, 1987, a well-known office-bearer of an American Associationannounced her resignation from the Association, with evidentdistress, because of her concern that her son would be rejectedby vocal members of the community as she had married anAmerican.110The arguments against intermarriage are the same in NorthAmerica as they have been seen to be elsewhere—the erosion ofracial identity,111the alleged increase in marital breakdowns and lossof any identity for the children of mixed marriages.112Becauseintermarriage appears to be more common in America, the con-sequences are seen to be more dramatic. In one AmericanAssociation the wife of a priest is American-born, and she is activelyinvolved as an office-bearer in the Association. Non-Zoroastrianpartners visit the centres and are present at ceremonies in most ofthe Associations. As in London, so in Toronto, this can give particu-lar problems at the time ofmuktadwhen the dead are remembered.Because death rites involve such strong notions of purity andpollution, it is a time when the impure presence of a juddincausesproblems for traditional Zoroastrians. At muktadin Toronto in 1984a non-Zoroastrian spouse was asked to leave the prayer room. In asubsequentNewsletter113the agreed position of the ManagingCommittee was expressed in a notice that said: ‘A special request isbeing made to non-Zoroastrian spouses and their children,although they are legally entitled to enter the Atash Dadgah roomZoroastrians in the USA and Canada476109For the Indian press see Dini Avaz, 1986, 11, pp. 4–8; for the American response,Gavashni, Mar. 1987, p. 8.110Parsiana, Apr. 1987, p. 25.

If the former,then can spouses and non-Zoroastrians be excluded? If the latter,how should the group be identified, since there are a number ofethnic groups within the community (Indians, Iranians, Pakistanis,Americans, etc.)? The religious identity should, presumably,exclude the non-religious individuals of Zoroastrian parents, whomay, nevertheless, have a strong sense of communal identity. It alsoignores the fact that some outsiders, particularly American author-ities, view them as an ethnic group. However, many, not least theyoung, want to be identified as a religious group, and as Americansor Canadians. As Mavalwalla said at the Toronto Congress, ‘Arewe here because we follow a religion together or are we an ethniccommunity? We are first Canadian, and then everything else.’114But others want to assert their religious identity first.115Theemphasis on the Zoroastrian identity being primarily religiousraises for many the question of conversion. This has surfaced inother countries, but nowhere as acutely as in America.The subject of conversion was raised by Pavri andTreasureywala at the Toronto Congress,116and again at the ChicagoCongress in 1977 by Bagli.117It was a major issue at theMontreal Congress in 1982. Adi Davar made a strong plea for theinitiation of non-Zoroastrians, not only of spouses, or children ofmixed marriages, but for the acceptance of any non-ZoroastriansZoroastrians in the USA and Canada477114See also Kabraji, Toronto Conference Proceedings, p. 87; Davar, Montreal CongressProceedings, p. 127; Mavalwalla, Chicago Proceedings,p.69.115Pavri to AGM at Vancouver, 24 Apr. 1977,ZSBC, p. 204; and the General Meeting,27 Oct. 1973,ZSCBC, p. 135, and especially to the board of directors, 30 July 1973,ZSBC,p. 131.

It hasbecome common in America to distinguish between conversion,i.e. active proselytism—which very few support—and the ‘accept-ance’ of those who come forward of their own initiative to seekinitiation. Davar’s paper was subsequently published separately. Itprovoked such discussion at the Congress that an additional sessionhad to be timetabled and the Montreal Association was asked toundertake a survey of authoritative opinions in America, Britainand India, from western academics and from Zoroastrian priests.The results were published in September 1983, but by then eventshad overtaken the discussions.The Peterson naujoteSpeaking after Davar at the Montreal Congress had been JosephPeterson. He was from a Christian background, although from aParsi perspective he was from a mixed marriage, because hismother was a Catholic, his father a Protestant. An earlier editionofGavashnihad referred to his interest in Zoroastrianism from theage of 15. He opened his Montreal paper with the words, ‘AlthoughI am not a Parsi or Irani, my interest in this subject hasapproached obsession.’ He gave an account of how the books hehad read in libraries, notably the Sacred Books of the Eastand MariaWilkins Smith’s translation of the Gathas, filled him with a love forZoroastrianism, how he had made his own sudreandkustiand howhe had tried to live according to the religion. On Saturday5 March 1983 he was initiated by four Zoroastrian priests at theNew York centre. The event was sponsored by the Guiv Trusts.Although the trustees did not begin the process for initiation, theystrongly supported it. Two of the trustees in particular, Sarfeh andMerabi, were involved and Sarfeh was keen that the event bepublicized.118The senior New York priest, Noshir Hormuzdyar,made it clear at the ceremony that he and his colleagues appreciatedthat it was the sort of event that Guiv had wanted. He said:Arbab believed that the doors of this temple should be kept open to allmankind and that we should be willing to ‘accept’ anyone who is willingto join us...Arbab believed that Zoroastrian religious knowledgeshould be shared and imparted and made available to anyone and every-one irrespective of caste, colour, creed, sex, age or race.

Aseparate issue was produced on the actual initiation (April 1983)and the debate filled many columns in future issues. The actionwas welcomed in various quarters in America, for example inthe Zoroastrian Center in California. In the preceding year theminutes of the board of trustees recorded that the Bombay HighPriest, Dastur Minocher Homji, ‘has advised Darius [Irani, aTrustee] that it is our duty to accept and convert people toZoroastrianism’.120The same board of trustees later asserted that,‘It is against the US constitution to deny Mr Peterson what reli-gion he desires...we cannot form our own laws.’121The event provoked considerable reaction in Bombay. Newsof the impending naujotewas published in the Orthodox newspaper,Jame Jamshed122in the form of a letter from a member of theChicago community, Sarosh M. Khambatta, to his father.123Helater protested that this had been a private letter and he had noidea of how the press had obtained a copy. In it he attacked oneof the priests in particular, Kersey Antia from Chicago, for hisinvolvement, saying: ‘We in Chicago are split about this Navjote.’He sought a letter of condemnation for the act from religiousauthorities in Bombay. These were sent by the president of one ofthe priestly madressas (Cama Athornan Institute), Sir JamsetjiJijibhoy, and by J. F. Shroff, trustee of the Athornan Mandal(Priestly Association) in Bombay. Sir JJ said in his letter: ‘As Mr Joseph Peterson is a Non-Parsi, he can never be initiated intothe Zoroastrian fold.’ He argued that ‘the matter should also havebeen properly and rightly referred to the learned and eruditeZoroastrians in the USA and Canada479119Mar. 1983, pp. 17–31.120Meeting dated 28 Sept. 1982.121Minutes of the board of trustees, 23 Feb. 1983.12216 Mar. 1983.123See e.g. the letter of Sarosh Khambatta published in Jame Jamshed, 5 Feb. 1983informing readers of the planned naujoteand asking ‘Could you approach the CamaAthornan Institute or any other religious body which confers the priesthood toZoroastrians, and obtain a letter on their letterhead stating that this action of conversionand mixed marriage is deplored and condemned by them...If they [the officiatingpriests] could be excommunicated from Priesthood it would be great. There are manyothers who are writing to these Institutes from here.’"},{"pageNumber":499,"pageContent":"High Priests and Avestan Scholars of international repute and theParsi Punchayet, Bombay.’124Similarly Shroff said, ‘We very muchdeprecate, deplore and condemn in no uncertain terms the dis-graceful action...The incident is without doubt a blot on the fairname of the community and the precepts laid down by our LordZarathushtra.’ He also enclosed a series of documents relating toearlier judgements for what he considered authoritative precedents.These were: 1. From the 1906 law case in the Bombay High Court(see Chapter 2), specifically the Anjuman resolution overturningthe committee’s acceptance of conversion, but did not include thejudgement of Justices Davar and Beaman; 2. A 1918 resolution ofthe Athornan Anjuman in Bombay condemning intermarriagewith a resolution that people who intermarry should be ostracizedand the priests involved should be boycotted; 3. A 1961 documentin which fourteen senior priests from Navsari, Bombay, Surat andPoona asserted the authority to give directions on religion (in thiscase funeral ceremonies, not initiations).One point behind all these documents is the belief that commun-ity and priestly directives in Bombay have religious authority overZoroastrian practice overseas. This question of authority will beaddressed below. The point here is the intensity of the debate inBombay, not only in the Jamebut also in other sections of the pressalso, for example the Bombay Samachar, which has Liberal inclinationsand tended to support the naujote.Parsianaeditorially proclaimed aneutral position and printed letters representing contrastingviewpoints, and numerous other articles, reports of meetings andspeeches were included. In Bombay, the strongest views wereexpressed by the Orthodox side, notably (but not only), the threeHigh Priests, Mirza, JamaspAsa and Kotwal, but also by laity, forexample Faribourz Nariman, Khojeste Mistree, Adi Doctor andHomi Ranina. But supportive views were also expressed by some inBombay, notably Jehan Daruwala, editor of the Bombay Samachar,Nani Palkiwala (an eminent diplomat and jurist) and S. R. Vakil,a writer on religious matters.125Zoroastrians in the USA and Canada480124Letter dated 30 Mar. 1983.125The contrary views are represented in Parsiana, 1983 Aug. pp. 67–77, see also thescholarly (Orthodox) priest Rohinton Peer in Jame Jamshed, 7 July 1983.

The intensity of the comments from Bombay fuelled thedebates within the North American community. Whereas Sarfehhad sought to publicize the event, trustees of the New York DarbeMehr in a published letter insisted that it had been a private func-tion, not one organized by them. Twelve New York priests alsopublished a letter (1 July 1983) stating that they would not join infunctions with Antia (although it was later pointed out that some ofthe signatories had never functioned in New York anyway126).Khambatta, who had first written to Bombay about the event, wasattacked by members of the Guiv Trusts as being ‘mentally, emo-tionally and culturally unprepared and incompatible to live in afree country like USA, where racism is abolished and people areleft free to worship their God the way they choose’. In personalconversation, a number of Zoroastrians have expressed to me theview that traditional Indian attitudes to conversion expressed in America could provoke a legal test case concerning racial pre-judice. This I have heard especially in Toronto, where theAssociation received $260,000 from the State as part of its multi-cultural programme. Some Bombay leaders interpreted thePeterson affair as part of the Parsi versus Iranian Zoroastriandivide: ‘This entire situation has been engineered by those whohave a vested interest. Antia craves for publicity while Hormuzdyaris married to a foreigner. The American Iranian Zoroastriansbesides, look only to the Gathas—the songs of ProphetZoroaster—which don’t mention conversion and which they don’tunderstand anyway.’127Antia has faced perhaps the most criticism,not simply because he participated, but because of his vigorousdefence in print of the naujote. His writings have been publishedin India as well as in America.Parsianaquoted his views and pub-lished separately his booklet,The Argument for Acceptance, in 1982.Antia and Khojeste Mistree, in particular, have clashed fiercely.Antia offered his resignation to his Chicago board at a meeting on13 February 1983. It was rejected only by the casting-vote of thechairman. Five members left the Association in protest. Antia hasfaced much hostility outside America. His paper for the 1985World Congress in Bombay was not accepted.

His offer was not accepted. At the close of theWorld Zoroastrian Organization symposium in London in 1984,Antia was asked not to participate in the concluding jashanfor fearof causing divisions. One factor behind his being ostracized is thathis priestly colleagues fear that if they function with him in rituals,they may be debarred from performing in temples in India, which anumber would wish to do after retirement.129One argument adduced by the Orthodox was that hadZoroastrians accepted converts in Iran during the Shah’s era, theywould now be suffering like the Baha’i and that such initiationscould still make the Iranian community vulnerable. In interviewsafter the naujote, two leading figures (Hormuzdyar and KaikhosrovIrani) stressed that Peterson had come to them; that they hadaccepted, not converted him; that he came from a Christian not aMuslim background. The Iranian priests had been deliberatelyleft out of the photographs because of the fear that the perceptionof proselytism could trigger persecution in Iran.130The opinion ofthe Mobed (Priestly) Council in Tehran was therefore sought.After an official meeting called to discuss the matter, their letter ofreply was written on 24 May 1983. It concluded:Asho Zarathushtra does not advocate force to spread the religion, but haskept it open for all. He has laid down rules and regulations for the propa-gation and promotion of the religion as well as for the acceptance of non-Zoroastrians. He has never reserved it for the Aryans or for a particularcaste of people...The above citations131show that the propagation andpromotion of the religion is a meritorious deed...If Zoroastrians believethat our religion is one of the great living religions of the world and thatit is beneficial to all peoples of the world, we must propagate it. We mustaccept persons who want to embrace the Zoroastrian religion.132As mentioned above, the debate has sometimes been characterizedas a Parsi versus Iranian Zoroastrian debate.

The most vocal supporter of Antia wasthe Iranian-dominated California Zoroastrian Centre in whichAli Jafarey was the teacher. But the situation is more complex thanthat. The controversial paper calling for the acceptance of convertswas by the Parsi Davar; two Parsis were among the four priests whoperformed the initiation; leading Bombay figures supported theinitiation and the person who wrote most in defence of the naujotewas the Parsi priest Antia. The Chicago Open Forum on conversion,attended mostly by Parsis, voted 90% in favour of the acceptance ofthenaujoteof spouse and children, and 86% voted for the accept-ance of anyone who came forward of their own volition andaccepted the religion. A substantial issue behind the debates is oneof religious authority: do the religious leaders in the old countryhave authority to direct the religious beliefs and practices of diasporacommunities?Religious authority in the diasporaFew Iranians or Parsis would consider Iran to be a centre whosedirectives they should seek to resolve doctrinal disputes. Only 1%of respondents to my survey would seek such a ruling. The ques-tion to the Mobed Council in Tehran following the Petersonnaujotewas virtually unique, and was only asked because others,notably Parsis, had introduced the Iranian dimension in theirarguments. Those who turn to the ‘old country’ for authoritativeguidance are sections of the Parsi community. The letters fromJijibhoy, Shroff, Doctor and others in the Peterson case, all indi-cate a conviction that authority lies in the traditional priests, espe-cially Dasturs Mirza, JamaspAsa and Kotwal, and in Indianpractices, not, as they see it, in ‘the whims and fancies’ of thosewho have migrated for material advantage. Such a view is foundin some quarters in the diaspora. Bhathena at the MontrealCongress argued that the new communities should not cut them-selves off from the homeland, but rather, as the early settlers inIndia did, turn to the old country for guidance.133Munshi at theChicago Congress reminded people of their ties to the oldcountry, and their own responsibility to preserve the tradition: ‘ourZoroastrians in the USA and Canada483133Proceedings, p. 173."},{"pageNumber":503,"pageContent":"aunts and uncle, our relatives, are still in Bombay or India andwhatever we do here is going to have repercussions overthere...Nobody should pinpoint in five or ten years that thesewere the individuals in North America who practically wreckedthe whole tradition.’134An unnamed speaker from the floor at the floor of the ChicagoOpen Forum on conversion said: ‘As far as religion is concerned,we are very immature. Our priests themselves admit they aren’tscholars of the religion so we have to depend upon India and Iranfor our background and knowledge. Let us not alienate them; letus not push them away.’135There is also a consciousness that the new communities have toturn to India for the supply or training, and the initiation, ofpriests.136So, for example, Kersey Antia’s son went to Bombay forhisnaujote, and for his initiation into the priesthood.137One indic-ator of this sense of religious dependence is the number ofAmerican tours made by Indian Parsi priests and teachers, nor-mally at the invitation and expense of the American Associations,but sometimes also to see their own family who have migrated. Thefollowing list of visits made before 1985 is put together from astudy of the Minute Books of the various Associations: DasturFramroz Bode made a number of visits to California in the 1970s,but this was often to the Mazdayasni group in California ratherthan to the Zoroastrian Associations. The first to come as a resultof such formal invitations were Dastur Minocher Homji (1974,1984, 1985); Dr Homi Dhalla from Bombay (1977); Dastur Mirzafrom Udwada and Bombay (1978); Khojeste Mistree fromZoroastrian Studies, Bombay (1978, 1982, 1985); Dastur Dr FirozeKotwal from Bombay (1979, 1980, 1985, 1986 and many sub-sequent visits); ‘Dastur’ Aibara, a traditional priest from Bombay(1984).138There have been fewer visits from Iranian leaders, owingin part to the situation in that country. The only record I foundwas Dastoor Firoz Azargoshab in 1984 (and in the later period,Zoroastrians in the USA and Canada484134Toronto Proceedings,p.51.135Report, p. 7.136Mavalwalla, Toronto Proceedings,p.77.137Parsiana, Mar. 1981, p. 21 also reports the navarof two young boys from Montreal,Dastoor and Panthaki.138The title ‘Dastur’ is put in inverted commas, because Aibara was not technicallya Dastur, but is often given the honorific title in popular usage.

Also significant in the diaspora–old countryrelations is the fact that many American Zoroastrians make visitsto the old country whenever possible. When they do so, they makepilgrimages to major temples and Atash Bahrams, especially toUdwada. So it is recorded in the minutes of the VancouverAssociation: ‘The holy fire at Udwada radiates munificenceand glory to Zoroastrians everywhere and it is the duty of everyZoroastrian to pay homage to the sacred perpetually-burningfire.’139All diaspora Zoroastrians still have family and/or friendsback in the old country whom they visit, especially for such familyfunctions as naujotes, weddings or funerals. There is also quitefrequent contact by ‘telephone and letter. So although Americaand India are geographically far apart, it would be a mistake toimply an emotional or personal gulf between the communities.The exchange of newsletters and journals, such as Parsiana,maysometimes emphasize the doctrinal differences, but the personallinks commonly remain strong.There is another dimension to the subject of diaspora–oldcountry relations. Many American Zoroastrians are convincedthat they in the New World represent the future of the religionbecause in America there is a concentration of dynamic leaders.For example, Rohinton Rivetna, in his speech at the opening ofthe Chicago centre on 3 September 1983, said:I ask you, ladies and gentlemen, is there a group anywhere in the world,with the strong sense of commitment and involvement of NorthAmerican Zoroastrians? Is there a group anywhere in the world that hasachieved what the North American Zoroastrians have achieved in theshort space of their existence? Is there a group anywhere in the worldthat is more dynamic, more dedicated, or more determined than theNorth American Zoroastrians?Similarly, Lovji Cama at the Chicago Congress said that ‘the bestof a community has been brought by a divine plan’.140HomiHomji at the Seventh North American Congress speculated that,‘With the demographic degeneration of the Parsi population inIndia and Pakistan and the upsurge and unity in North America,Zoroastrians in the USA and Canada485139Reported at the AGM, 27 Oct. 1973, p. 135 when the committee resolved to makeregular donations for the burning ofmachi(sandalwood) on the holy fire on their behalf.140See also Bagli to the Toronto Symposium,Proceedings, p. 9, ‘the very cream of thesame progressive [Parsi] community has come over to this continent’."},{"pageNumber":505,"pageContent":"it is conceivable that...the global Zoroastrian focus may movefrom Bombay to North America, and FEZANA, in turn, may pro-vide a world Zoroastrian democratic leadership.’141It is notuncommon to find parallels drawn between the original Parsimigration to India and the new settlement in America. This wasarticulated by Moti Balsara in her introduction to the first sessionat the 1975 Toronto Symposium: ‘One might say that there is asort of a parallel between our starting a Zoroastrian communityon this continent and between the time when we first started as avery small community in India.’ The establishment of Zoroastriancommunities can thus be seen by some of their members as aturning point in the religion. It is not only Zoroastrians inAmerica who see diaspora groups in the New World as the futureleaders of the religion. The respected Bombay Parsi writer, AspiModdie, has expressed the same view: ‘The leadership in NorthAmerica is more dynamic and comes from all age groups, not leastthe youth, and from more women. FEZANA produced a ladypresident in less than a decade, which the Indian Federation hasnot done in nearly three decades.’ He also criticized BombayParsis for not being democratic.142To some in America, the Indian Parsi community represents anantiquated past, incapable of organising its own affairs, much lessable to direct those in a different setting. So Homi Homji speakingat an earlier congress, after criticizing what he describes as ‘tooth-less Panchayets’ riven by controversy, presiding over a rapidlydiminishing community, said:The question for us here in North America is whether we can continue toaccept such lack of leadership and remote influence from halfway roundthe world. If these institutions are unable to asses the need for changeeven within their own local flock, what understanding and action can weexpect from them of the entirely different milieu of the New World?He concluded: ‘We must retain from our tradition what is usefuland applicable, reject what is harmful or hinders our progress,and innovate procedures and practices necessary to fill the gapthat has resulted from our moving away from a static and archaicsystem of the countries we left behind.’143Similarly, BahramZoroastrians in the USA and Canada486141Houston, 1990.142A Moddie, ‘A Different Approach’,Parsiana, Jan. 1997, p. 27.143Montreal Congress, 1982,Proceedings, pp. 136 f."},{"pageNumber":506,"pageContent":"Faradieh reported to his Chicago Association on the Third WorldZoroastrian Congress he had attended in Bombay: ‘Having wit-nessed in Bombay the inability of the Congress to resolve any vitalissues he stressed the fact that they were an autonomous inde-pendent group charged with the future of our children, and thatwe should mould our own future as we see fit and as dictated bycircumstances and laws of this country.’144Behind this conclusionlay a deep frustration at what he saw as the pointless in-fighting ofPunchayet trustees (some respected figures had recently resignedover allegations concerning the management of charitable fundsfor housing) and the way in which the needs of diaspora Parsiswere ignored.

All we ask isthat such a body be available to those who do seek guidance.At the same Congress, Munshi made a similar plea for guidance:In America Zoroastrians have a deep hunger for genuine religiousexperience and awareness and we need help to find the richness of ournoble and ancient religion...We are concerned for the youth of ourcommunity and are trying to assist them in their quest for authenticreligious fulfillment through religious classes, seminars and groupdiscussions...In the absence of sound religious leadership, some ofus have started manipulating Zarathushtra’s teaching and code of ethicsto suit our vested social interest.In particular he asked for guidance on the naujoteof children ofintermarriages.Zoroastrians in the USA and Canada487144Chicago AGM, 11 June 1978."},{"pageNumber":507,"pageContent":"When the Third World Congress responded to neither of theserequests for guidance and leadership, then Faradieh decidedAmerican Zoroastrians had to chart their own path.

Our conditions are quite dif-ferent from those existing here.’145Such frustration at the per-ceived lack of leadership and understanding can be seen in theviews of many who decided that they had no choice but to take alead themselves. Bagli at Chicago, and later in Gavashni,sawinevitable changes as a reaction to ‘the stagnation of theZoroastrian religion across the board. Let us start here first. Wewill learn from it and then go out and do it around the world.’146These appeals for guidance and support were made five yearsbefore the Peterson naujote. The Bombay reaction to the naujotewasprobably a major factor in growing tensions between Bombay andNorth American Zoroastrians. An unnamed speaker at theChicago Open Forum on conversion (12 June 1983) declared:We Zoroastrians in North America had better refrain from clannishnessand racism. We had better review our customs in the light of presentday environment. How long can we depend on India and Iran to spoon-feed us with antiquated religious direction. The religious knowledge ofan average priest in India, let alone the laity, is pathetic. We need boldmoves, we need bold priests who let their consciences speak; we needbold administrators who take the strain of controversy, calculating andcoming up with solutions.147As we have seen in other centres, the debates over policies andreligious issues are particularly intense because both sides areaware that if the wrong decisions or policies are implemented, thisdiminishing religion could come to an end.

Viewing each other from a distance acrossthe Hindu Kush, both have seen the other simply as co-religionists.Parsis have commonly regarded Iranians as ‘blood brothers’ andso have often accepted the possibility of an Iranian ‘converting’—or better, ‘returning’—to their religion. In the nineteenth centurya number of Parsis campaigned on behalf of oppressed IranianZoroastrians, were benefactors for schools and other socialneeds, and helped those able to leave Iran to seek a new life inIndia. (It has to be said, also, that many Parsis were patronizingin their attitude to Iranian Zoroastrians.) There has been discussionin Bombay since 1904 of Parsis returning to their Iranian home-land, and this speculation peaked in the early 1970s when theShah encouraged them to return and help build the economy andinfrastructure of what was then a rapidly expanding nation. Whenthe Shah fell from power in 1979, the Zoroastrian communities inAmerica were composed almost wholly of Parsis. It is obviousfrom the records of various Associations, notably California,Chicago, Vancouver, Toronto and Quebec, that manyZoroastrians pressed their respective governments to view sym-pathetically requests from their Iranian co-religionists for visas.One may presume that far more was done than is on the record.The main centres to which the Iranians migrated were New York,Vancouver, Toronto and, increasingly, California.As the Iranian Zoroastrians and the Parsis began to settle downin the same Associations, apparently trivial differences betweenthem slowly emerged, for example, over food148and dress. Theywere symptoms of a deeper cultural divide, notably in language, inthe observance of festivals and in fundamental religious assump-tions: for example, the value of the priesthood; the authoritativeplace of revealed scripture; the contrast between a human, ifholy, prophet and the idea of a divine being on earth; and theZoroastrians in the USA and Canada489148The ZAGNY newsletter of 14 Dec. 1981 relates that Chinese food was bought infor a function at the Darbe Mehr, rather than provoke the Iranian dislike of Parsi food astoo spicy, or the Parsi view of Iranian kebabs as boring."},{"pageNumber":509,"pageContent":"importance of rituals. The doctrinal differences reflect a millenniumof separation in Muslim and Hindu environments respectively.Another factor is that most of the Iranian Zoroastrians whomigrated were well-to-do urban people, mainly from Tehran, wherethey had an urbane, cosmopolitan life, and their traditions were dif-ferent from those preserved in the villages: for example, the puritylaws, where beliefs and practices were more similar to the OrthodoxParsi traditions. The Tehran Zoroastrians had been influenced notonly by the Muslim environment but also by the more Reformingwing of the Parsis. There is, therefore, to some extent in America,an element of the Orthodox–Reform divide following nationalityboundaries. The causes for the patterns of difference are complex.The religious debates have often focused on conversion, not leastthe Peterson naujote, but they have also been about communal andsocial issues. Language has been a major problem. Few of theIranian Zoroastrians had planned to migrate, and so there was lit-tle preparation. Farsi is much stronger among them than Gujarati isamong Parsis. French, rather than English, had been the secondlanguage in Iran. Both groups enjoy speaking their old languageat social functions. But it is a common human experience that ifothers in a room are speaking in a language one does not under-stand, the notion often arises that one is being spoken about andcriticized. The result has been suspicion. In almost all places,California and Vancouver apart, the Parsis are in a substantial major-ity; consequently Iranian Zoroastrians have felt that the democraticprocess of elections, one person, one vote, has not given them rea-sonable representation in committees or as office-bearers.149In somecentres, New York for example, places on the board were set aside forIranians.150In Chicago a different policy was adopted, whereby any-one who wanted to serve on the board could sign up, and that boardthen elected its own officers.151Attempts have been made to explaineach party’s customs to the others, notably Iranian observance of thegahambars, Mehragan and Jashne Sadeh in particular, which haddropped into disuse among Parsis from Bombay. Persian classesand Persian evenings were also organized.152But suspicionsZoroastrians in the USA and Canada490149The newsletter of the Zoroastrian Society of Ontario [Toronto] Executive Committeefor July 1982 records the Iranian boycott of elections after the AGM, 27 June 1982.150ZAGNY circular, 6 Mar. 1985, records the allocation of a vice-president and meet-ings secretary of the board for Iranians.151P.

The Association in Vancouver has worked hard to keep thetwo groups together, and the Iranian Zoroastrians are particularlyactive. As noted above,Payk-e-Mehris edited from Vancouver and aswe shall see in Chapter 10 a major Internet site is run from the city.Despite these moves to bring the two groups together, in someplaces basically separate Associations have been formed. In LosAngeles, Mrs Farangis Shahrokh started an Iranian CulturalAssociation. Originally she envisaged an affiliation with the Parsi-dominated Zoroastrian Association of California, and then in1979 a link was discussed with the Bombay-based ZoroastrianFoundation. But cultural and personal differences were evidentand in 1979 it was decided to open a Zoroastrian Centre sepa-rately from the Parsis. In 1980 Arbab Rustom Guiv promised abuilding, which was opened later that year. By 1982 planningbegan to erect a purpose-built centre, and this was opened in1986. It is a striking building, and a number of Parsis began toattend. Some appreciated the use of a gas flame to provide a per-manently burning fire (suggesting that the original fires in Iranmay have been the products of the vast gas, as well as oil, fields).Others thought that this neglected the whole concept of servingthe fire, which underlies the ritual, a view that has been expressedstrongly to me by an Iranian Zoroastrian as well as Parsis.153Although there were tensions between Iranian Zoroastrians andParsis in California, the Associations there did not come about asa direct result of such antagonism, as did the separate Associationsin New York. ZAGNY had been Parsi-dominated, but one of thefounders, and holder of one of the three places on the boardreserved for Iranians, Khodarahn Hematti (vice-president1982–4), alleged poor book-keeping and a neglect of Iranianinterests.154The first recorded meeting of the Iranian ZoroastrianAssociation (IZA) was held in New York on 20 May 1984, when itZoroastrians in the USA and Canada491153Mr Parviz Varjavand in private conversation during the Seventh World ZoroastrianCongress, Houston, 2000.154The allegations were made in much more forceful language.

Considerable tension arose overthe rights of the new body, which stressed it was separate fromZAGNY, to use the centre, its premises, address and telephonenumber for business purposes. When ZAGNY asked if IZA func-tions were open to all ZAGNY members, no answer was received.A meeting was arranged between the two groups, but the IZA didnot attend because it complained that the agenda had been set byZAGNY. Further disputes arose over the rights of the IZA to usethe property without paying rent and over contributions torepairs. At the same time a dispute broke out with the Guiv Trustson the ownership of the building (as they did later in Toronto andSydney). Because two of the founder members of the IZA,Sohrab Mehrabi and Dr Rustom Sarfeh, were Guiv trustees, theZAGNY fear was that they would be excluded from the centrewhich they had built up, albeit with substantial Guiv funding.When ZAGNY ‘overwhelmingly’ rejected the Guiv Trust’s condi-tions for their use of the building, the matter went to court, andthe court found in ZAGNY’s favour. That was not the end of theproblems, because the annual budget from the Guiv Trusts formaintenance of the building ($5,000) fell far short of the real costs($17,000). However, the IZA refused to contribute towards theshortfall, on the grounds that the property had been purchasedwith Iranian money and they had previously paid their dues asZAGNY members. During the 1990s the sharpness of the divisioneased somewhat, but they remain separate Associations, andmoves to raise the money for a new and more appropriate build-ing have been difficult; however, in 2000 moves involving both theIZA and ZAGNY made a new centre possible.A compounding problem in negotiations between the two groupsis the grief which many Iranian Zoroastrians feel at the more or lessenforced exile from their homeland. Because they felt compelled tomigrate, through fear of persecution, Iranian Zoroastrians areunderstandably very sensitive over issues such as language, food andZoroastrians in the USA and Canada492and my own study of the minutes of both the ZAGNY board also of the AGM.

The Iranian Zoroastrians feel bonded to their her-itage, its symbols, expressions and rituals, at least as much as theIranians in Los Angeles discussed by Naficy (see Chapter 1).Whereas Parsis can easily visit the old country, friends and families,Iranian Zoroastrians find that difficult. Because the Iranians feltforced to leave the Zoroastrian homeland, and cannot easily return,they grieve for it. From the Parsi perspective, the IranianZoroastrians do not always value the Parsi aid to the Iranians a cen-tury ago (and since). The Iranians are thought not to appreciate thework that was put in to build up the Association(s) before theymigrated to the continent, and are seen as making demands whichare not democratic and therefore unreasonable (specifically theeradication of one person, one vote, for committee elections).Resentment can be provoked by the fairly common first-generationIranian insistence on not using the language of the new country.Some Parsis have expressed resentment at feeling excluded fromsuch festivals as No Ruz, which some Iranian Zoroastrians celebratewith other Iranians—Muslims, for example (a complaint noticedabove with respect to Germany). Equally, Iranians can resent theParsi tendency to use Gujarati at social functions, or their failure tocelebrate festivals in what they consider to be ‘the proper way’. Sothere are tensions on both sides as the two groups seek to settledown together in the New World. It is worth recording one particu-lar example of Parsi–Iranian collaboration, namely the help forrefugees from Iran. In the early years following the revolution,Khojeste Mistree was deeply involved, along with Parsis in Pakistanand America, in obtaining entry visas to the US. Such activity nec-essarily had to be very discreet, but with financial help from twoleading American-based Iranian Zoroastrians, a number ofrefugees were assisted. There is a moving letter of thanks fromtwelve such refugees in one of the early issues of the Journal.155Working through internal multicultural policies in smallAssociations is more difficult than outsiders readily understand.

It is to them that the ancient knowledge andpractices of our religion and way of life must be imparted, ifZoroastrianism is not to become extinct on this continent.157Most Zoroastrian communities around the globe are concernedfor their young people, partly because of the strength of the familyunit in their traditions, and partly because diminishing numbersmake the transmission of the tradition to the next generation aquestion of communal life or death. But few if any centres havearticulated and responded to this need as fully as the AmericanZoroastrians. The problem there is accentuated by the vast dis-tances not simply between centres but within the areas covered byan Association. The other problem, especially in the US, is thefear of the ‘melting pot’ noted above. This section focuses on theefforts to counter these perceived problems.The first issue ofParsianato include a section on ‘ZoroastriansAbroad’ included a quotation from the outgoing president of theZoroastrian Society of Ontario, Yezdi Antia:Perhaps the greatest challenge to the retaining of our identity is the dis-semination of information amongst Zoroastrians about themselves. Anaverage Zoroastrian is not very well acquainted with the principles ofhis religion. Very few amongst us can discuss very knowledgeably ourhistory, Iranian and Indian. This is not surprising and is due to the lackof simple and concise publications on this subject that are suitable in aNorth American context. This also prevents us from imparting to ourchildren basic and factual knowledge about ourselves that can give thema sense of identity.158Zoroastrians in the USA and Canada494156See e.g. Munshi’s interview in Parsiana, Oct. 1989, pp. 13 f.157Bulsara at the Montreal Congress,Proceedings, p. 109.158Parsiana, June–Sept. 1976, p. 27."},{"pageNumber":514,"pageContent":"The various North American congresses typically have youthsections; for example, at Montreal there was a panel entitled‘Youth Debate: Will Zoroastrian Culture Survive on thisContinent?’159In addition to the youth programmes of the vari-ous Associations already noted, a series of American ZoroastrianYouth Congresses have been organized, starting in Los Angeles in1987.160In 1993 FEZANA organized the First World ZoroastrianYouth Congress in Los Angeles, but that, and its consequences,will be discussed in the following section on the 1990s. MostZoroastrian communities (Hong Kong is an exception) have activeyouth programmes, but they are particularly strong on the NorthAmerican continent. The general media often refer to the ‘cult ofyouth’ in America, and if this were not matched within theZoroastrian community the dangers of losing those youths wouldbe yet greater. There is acute awareness that the young meet fel-low Zoroastrians rarely more than once a month, but are in dailycontact with American youth culture. A powerful paper was pre-sented at the Seventh World Congress in Houston by Laila F. M.Contractor who, moved by her close Zoroastrian friend’s conver-sion to Christianity, set out to interview others who had convertedand/or married out in order to find out why they had done this.A common response was that Christian churches were found tobe peaceful and priests were helpful at times of difficulty. Herrespondents said that they had felt marginalized at Zoroastrianfunctions. Those who married out said that they had an insuffi-cient knowledge of their religion to remain within it. This is a fearthat has led to religious education becoming a characteristicfeature of North American Zoroastrian communities.Religious educationReligious education (RE) has a higher profile in North Americathan in almost any other centre, certainly higher than in Bombay.As Cama stressed in his 1978 Bombay Congress paper (p. 3), notonly do young people not meet Zoroastrians very often, they also:‘do not have frequent exposure to ritual and ceremony, some donot know what an Agiari or Atash Behram looks like.

The plan was to start an educationcommittee whose objective would be: ‘to stimulate religiousthought and inspire deep religious feelings among children andtheir parents, to invigorate the bond of brotherhood and unityamong us Zoroastrians and to revitalize our heritage throughprayers, religious ceremonies and customs.’162Although the records of many Associations show that the earlyleaders were concerned that members were slow to take advantageof the classes, the considerable efforts made by some indicate howimportant a Zoroastrian religious education was to many parents.The ZAGNY newsletter of 14 December 1981, mentions one fam-ily which travelled 185 miles in each direction to bring their threechildren to religious classes. ZAGNY highlights the problem ofmany Associations across the continent: its membership wasspread over fifty to a hundred towns, only 50% lived in New YorkCity, with the rest scattered over a hundred-mile radius.163InToronto, one member (Noshir Parakh) sought to counter this prob-lem by starting a ‘fetch and carry service’, collecting the childrenZoroastrians in the USA and Canada496161Minutes of the meeting of 5 Apr. 1966 and mentioned in the first Newsletter, June1966. It was similarly a priority in the other early Associations: New York, Annual Report,1 March 1976; Toronto, see the first executive committee meeting, 8 May 1971. The ear-liest constitution of the Zoroastrian Association of California, dated 22 July 1978, put asits second objective: ‘To inspire religious thought and feeling among Zoroastrian children.’Once the Zoroastrian Center was established in Los Angeles (Anaheim) the records showthat the first series of functions arranged (Mar.–Sept. 1981) included three religious talks,two Avesta classes (one in English, one in Persian), and a Farsi class.162Newsletter, 20 June 1982.163Lowji Cama reported to Parsiana, July–Aug. 1995, p. 33."},{"pageNumber":516,"pageContent":"and taking them to his home for the classes.164This action provedto be a turning point in the RE programme of a centre with per-haps the greatest activity in this area. Classes were started on oppo-site sides of the city to enable families to come. It is not uncommonto find young Zoroastrians expressing a deep desire for informedguidance on their heritage. One example is that of Phil Sidhwa,the founder of the Zarthushti Youth of Ontario, in a newsletter hestarted for this group in September 1981:In our co-existence with the western world, we tend to ignore our veryown traditions, and we inadvertently break apart the foundations of ourforefathers...Ifonly our very own knowledgeable elders of the com-munity, and I believe there are many, would inconvenience themselvesjust a little, to teach our religion to no one else than their children, wewould regain the supremacy and acknowledgement that we once pos-sessed and deserved...The youth of today are starving with curiosityto gain knowledge of their heritage. We feel hopelessly trapped betweenthe attitude and ideology of western civilization and our sincere desireto explore and uncover the foundation of our culture.165A New York initiative, subsequently taken up by otherAssociations, was the start of the ‘Good Life’ Zoroastrianemblem in the Scouting movement. This was officially launchedon 10 December 1983, to provide an RE programme onZoroastrianism for the young of the community. It was officiallyrecognized by the Scouting movement for the award of a badge.166The inspiration behind the venture, Fred Morris, was himself aleading scouter and a Zoroastrian. Here, as in other Associations,the acquisition of certificates is seen as an appropriate stimulant tolearning among North American Zoroastrians. Another initiativeto encourage Sunday school attendance started in the 1980s inChicago and still successful at the end of the millennium, is organiz-ing a sleepover the night before so that learning about the religion isassociated with socializing. Some of the people I first met as young-sters in my visits in the early 1980s are now adults.

In personal conversation many Zoroastrians have com-mented to me that not only their religious commitment, but alsotheir desire to learn about their religion increased after migration,partly to answer their children’s questions, partly to answer thequestions of outsiders, and partly because life in a new cultureaccentuated their own sense of distinctiveness. With their higheducational achievements many Zoroastrians in India, and espe-cially Pakistan, take a serious interest in their religion throughbooks and lectures (see Chapters 2 and 4). But this is yet furtherdeveloped in America, particularly in Associations near universitydepartments of Iranian studies. The obvious example is NewYork, where Professor Kaikhusroo Irani started a series of classesfor the elders while their children had their Sunday school. Heand Lovji Cama (who was given the role in the community of‘Dean of Studies’) organized day schools and seminars.167TheAssociation records show that the following non-Zoroastrianspeakers lectured to ZAGNY during these settlement years: DaleBishop (1977, 1979); Carl Zemensky (1977); Stanley Insler (1981);Shaul Shaked (1981); James Russell (1981, 1983); Jacob Stern(1981); Charles Evans (1982); Cyrus Pangborn (1984); MaryBoyce (1985); John Hinnells (1985).

Toronto, Chicago and others also have invitedvarious non-Zoroastrian academics.168This is a substantial pro-gramme of seeking scholarly contributions to the life of theAssociations.

Various centres have set up libraries formembers, for example in Anaheim, Chicago and Toronto, andextensive efforts are being made in the new millennium inHouston.

The fear of being branded racists for thepolicy on (non-)conversion has already been alluded to. Anotherfear expressed in some quarters is that the ritual interests of Parsipriests from India might make Zoroastrianism appear ‘superstitious’to Americans. For example, when ‘Dastur’ Aibara visitedAmerica his attraction for some of the elders was not matched byinterest among the youth, with his emphasis (speaking only inGujarati) on the efficacy of personal mantras (see Chapter 2above). Another example was the protest from the board of theZoroastrian Center in California to Dastur Kotwal from Bombay,questioning his choice of the study of the major liturgical texts,theNirangistan, during his stay at Harvard, because they feared itwould not be for the good of the image of the religion.169TheCenter’s publication,The Zoroastrian, contains a number of articlesantagonistic to what they perceive as a ritualistic priesthood,170and rejecting what they see as the late religious corruption ofmuch of the Middle Persian tradition.171When the AmericanAcademy of Religion devoted a section of its annual congress to‘Ritual in the Zoroastrian Tradition’ in 1986, the Center protestedthat the focus was on the later materials, and Parsi priestly prac-tices. They argued successfully for a paper to be read by Dr AliJafarey on the pure Gathic teaching and on Iranian traditions.172The other American newsletter to emphasize doctrine was theQuebec-basedGavashni. Its doctrinal position approximates tothat ofThe Zoroastrian. It was not so concerned to present theIranian perspective, and was somewhat more sympathetic topriestly concerns and rituals. But its editors (Bagli, in particular)were unhappy about much use of the Middle Persian tradition,not least the cosmic dualism it explicitly elaborates.Gavashni, likeZoroastrians in the USA and Canada499169Agreed at a meeting on 13 Jan. 1980.170For example, June–Oct. 1984.

Thenewsletter of the Association in Ontario, for example, oftenincluded lengthy quotations from him in issues published duringthis period. He is also quoted quite often in The Zoroastrian,atmeetings elsewhere and by the Chicago priest, Antia.173Hisattempt to reconcile western scholarship and religious values withZoroastrian devotion and ideals evidently met the religious needsof a later generation encountering comparable difficulties in theNew World.The practice and understanding of prayer is a particular issueof concern for many American Zoroastrians. Dhalla was quitetraditional in his own devotional practice, but he was also con-scious of the need of many western-educated people for devo-tional prayers in the vernacular, hence his book Homage unto AhuraMazda. Numerous American Associations, for example, New York,Chicago and Toronto, have sought translations of the prayers sothat the young can understand them. In this they are expressing aperception of the function of prayer which is more in accord withProtestant understandings of prayer as dialogue with God, ratherthan the understanding of prayer elaborated by the Orthodoxpriesthood in Bombay.174In the New World, prayers recited withoutunderstanding are interpreted as superstitious. The Orthodoxpriestly perspective is that prayers are the activation of holy wordsof religious power, first uttered by the Prophet when he sawAhura Mazda and which, when recited in a state of purity, withdevotion and intent, make actively present the spiritual forces towhich they refer. From the latter perspective, understanding canZoroastrians in the USA and Canada500173For example at ZAGNY, see ‘Kindling Fires—Jashn-e-Sadeh’,Parsiana, Mar. 1982, p. 7.174See ‘War and Medicine in Zoroastrianism’ in Selected Works, pp. 277–300 at 299 f."},{"pageNumber":520,"pageContent":"be an impediment since it restricts the worshipper to the mereconceptual level of human language.The public imageImplicit in much of this, in addition to concern for their ownyoung, is the fundamental concern with the presentation of animage to the wider society. American Zoroastrians are acutely con-scious that few outsiders have heard of their religion. So, at theToronto Congress, Mavalwalla said (p. 43): ‘Here...your namemeans nothing other than to connect you to a poverty-stricken partof the world. Only a few academics and a handful of others canproperly differentiate a Zoroastrian...One of the major objectsof the Zoroastrian Society of Ontario is to teach all our fellowCanadians to recognize us in the light of our faith.’ The need wasunderlined for Toronto Zoroastrians when they purchased a build-ing for their centre, and local residents sought to impose a by-lawrestricting permission to single-family residences in the areabecause they feared ‘that it was a strange religious group’. The ini-tial ruling was declared null and void by the Ontario SupremeCourt, 30 June 1978, on the grounds that it was ‘enacted in badfaith and discriminatory’.175Similarly, when a television pro-gramme used the word ‘cult’ with reference to a Zoroastrian, whilethe picture of the Toronto Center was on the screen, the executivecommittee supported a strong protest from their president saying,‘Obviously your research section cannot have carried out an in-depth study of this ancient faith to so degrade it by referring to itas a cult, and equating it with some faddish religious movement.’176It is the same concern that explains the vigour with which publi-cations perceived as defamatory are attacked. So, for example,June Kronholz wrote an article in the Wall Street Journalwith theheading and subheading: ‘After 3,400 years, India’s Parsis fearthey are dying out: lag in marriages, births hits sect of FireWorshippers; the trouble with vultures.’177Letters of protest weresent by Bagli from Quebec, Pavri of Vancouver, Irani from LosAngeles and James Russell of Columbia University.

To myknowledge, no American Association refrains from such involve-ment, but Toronto,179Vancouver180and Chicago are especiallyactive. One of the early activists in this field a VancouverZoroastrian, Ed Edulji, was deeply involved in the development ofmulticulturalism in British Columbia.

During his student days, and again on his return to Iran, hewas liberal in his politics and basically pro-Shah. After working forsuch government enterprises as the National Iranian Oil Company,he came to the attention of ministers, until he eventually becameIran’s representative to Opec, a Vice-Minister of Finance (a nonMuslim could not become a Minister), and the Deputy PrimeMinister. In 1971, he was made Chancellor of one of Iran’s mostprestigious educational establishments, the Pahlavi University inShiraz. There, he presided over its growth into a major interna-tional university and was deeply involved in arranging the 2,500thanniversary celebrations of the founding of the Persian Empire. Heremained as Chancellor until the revolution, making the universityone of the least troublesome political centres, through his reputa-tion for listening to different points of view and for acting justly.After the revolution he was put on the list for arrest and executionbecause he had held high office under the Shah.

He refers to them in interviews with such mag-azines as the International Herald Tribune.189Various Associations havesought his backing. He was asked, for example, to become a trusteeof the Ancient Iran Cultural Society of California, the ‘prototype’of the Zoroastrian Center, and was asked by them to compose aZoroastrian hymn.190He has joined various Associations in theirfundraising efforts for their buildings, notably Chicago191and espe-cially New York.

Her naujotewas nota matter of controversy, both because the community loved him,and because, as the offspring of a Parsi male, according to the 1906High Court judgement, she could officially be initiated.Wings of FireMehta’s biggest involvement with the projection of the Zoroastrianimage was the production of a film and video (categorized as a‘docu-drama’) which eventually appeared in 1986, entitledWings ofFire.193The project itself became something of an epic. The firstreport of it I can find was made in the summer of 1981.194Thereafter it was commonly reported in newsletters in America,India, Britain, Hong Kong and elsewhere.195The film producerwas Cyrus Bharucha, a British-born Zoroastrian, who had workedfor several years for the BBC on such prize-winning projects asGandhi’s IndiaandThe Forsyte Saga. He brought some famous namesinto the project, for example, William Humble, a scriptwriterinvolved in British productions such as Churchill: The Wilderness Yearsand a very popular series All Creatures Great and Small.

Further, Bharucha persuadedsome actors from the Royal Shakespeare Company to take part.With the basic theme being Mehta’s ‘quest for his roots’, the filmlooked set to be a huge success.The raising of funds for such an ambitious project proved a pro-tracted business, with donations made and shares purchased byindividual firms (for example the Tatas and Godrejs) andZoroastrian Associations around the world. In India the fundswere collected by a trust established for the film, the OrientalHeritage Trust, under the chairmanship of the diplomat NaniPalkiwala. It also received the active co-operation of the BombayParsi Punchayet, the High Priest Dastur Firoze Kotwal, and thefounder of Zoroastrian Studies, Khojeste Mistree (the last twoeventually appeared in the film). In America the foundation wasregistered as Persepolis Productions Inc., and was closely relatedto ZAGNY, which made loans, helped raise funds through variousfunctions and acted as a collecting point so that, as a tax-exemptbody, it ensured that the donations could be tax-deductible.196An inevitable consequence of such international fundraisingfrom diverse Zoroastrian bodies, and of the extremely high profileof the project, was that many people wanted to have an influen-tial voice in the making, especially in the script, of the film.A script committee was established at the Montreal Congress con-sisting of Professor Irani (on whose approval of the script theZAGNY support was conditional); Dr Jehan Bagli, the Quebec-based editor ofGavashni, and Dastur Minocher Homji of Bombay.All these individuals have a reputation for being on the Liberal orReforming wing of the community. They were supported byKhojeste Mistree, who was also present. The producer, Bharucha,brought two western academics with him to a script meeting,Dr James Russell (then of Columbia University) and Dr AlanWilliams of Manchester University, both with the reputation forbeing close to the Orthodox, or traditional, wing of the community.A committee is rarely likely to produce a flowing script, but suchtotally contrasting positions as were represented at the meetinginevitably generated mutually exclusive interpretations of the doc-trine and the result was extreme rancour. Prof. Farhang Mehr,as chairman of the committee, wrote to Dolly Dastoor, who hadZoroastrians in the USA and Canada506196ZAGNY correspondence file, S. Merabi to I. Gandhy and F. Patel, dated 22 May 1982."},{"pageNumber":526,"pageContent":"been president of the Montreal Congress, requiring her to put onrecord that he had walked out of the meeting because of the acri-mony and because he and the committee thought the whole scriptto be ‘inadequate and harmful.’197Prof. Irani also registered hisdisapproval of the script with ZAGNY because ‘it propagates themessage of dualism and does not show Zoroastrianism as amonotheistic religion’.198The film was later questioned, and thenattacked, from another side. Two High Priests, Dasturs Mirza andJamaspAsa, censured the script for presenting Zoroaster as aphilosopher: ‘denuding the prophet of his supernatural status andshowing him as a mere mortal’. There was also a fear that it wouldattract converts, for the Peterson naujotewas still part of contem-porary debate.199The Dasturs did not reject the idea of a film, butfeared, on the basis of press reports and interviews, that ‘the effectof [this] film is going to be quite adverse and harmful especiallyto the younger generation’.200Bharucha sought to reassure theDasturs in the next issue ofParsianaand satisfied one enough forhim to agree to participate (Dastur Kotwal).The debate continued throughout the making and editing ofthe film. So in 1984–5 the Council of Vigilant Parsis (COVP) cir-culated widely a copy of a letter they sent to the Central Board ofFilm Censors in India saying that the film ‘will be a deliberate andmalicious outrage on the Parsi Zoroastrian community where reli-gious feelings are sought to be violently hurt by insulting...itsreligion and/or its beliefs’. Although normally COVP are dia-metrically opposed on doctrinal matters to the AmericanZoroastrians who had been on the script committee, the two sidescame together to condemn the script for the same reason, that itpresented Zoroastrianism as a dualism. The COVP added theobjection that Zoroaster was presented as subject to human frail-ties and not ‘as a divine being’.201Subsequently COVP petitionedthe Bombay High Court for a staying order against the publicZoroastrians in the USA and Canada507197Letter dated 8 Mar. 1983.198Board meeting minutes, 30 Mar 1984. In February of that year Farhang Mehr hadwritten to the ZAGNY board, again in his role as chair of the committee, ‘to record thatthe community has no involvement with the script of the film, The Quest for Zarathushtrasince November 1982’—ZAGNY miscellaneous correspondence file.199Parsiana, Aug. 1983, p. 65.200H.

The case went to appeal on 25 July and thecourt found in favour of the producers, so the film was shown.202It appeared in Bombay cinemas and on national network TV inIndia, and videos have circulated widely among Zoroastriansaround the world. It had its gala premiere in New York in October1985, but it has not reached a large non-Zoroastrian market. Thecontroversy raged so fiercely because of the perceived vulnerabil-ity of a tiny and threatened community in the face of a powerfulmedium, especially with the involvement of a community hero.Some feared that this publicity might attract converts and so causefurther division, just as the furor over the Peterson naujotewasbeginning to subside. The Iranians felt that their perspective onthe religion was neglected because the influential voices had beenfrom the Parsis, and others feared that it might project the com-munity in a bad light to the outside world. The motivation formaking the film was to increase knowledge about, and respect for,the religion, not least among its own young people. It is difficultfor outsiders, coming from a majority tradition, to appreciate howdeeply troubling it is for a minority group when they perceivethreats on many sides. Films made about Jesus that someChristians believe to be blasphemous cause distress, but they arenot likely to have a significant effect on the course of Christianhistory. There was a real fear on the part of many that Wings ofFiremight significantly impact on the future of the diminishingZoroastrian community. In fact this did not happen and many,especially young people, have been supported in their religiousidentity.Patterns of religious belief and practice among North American Zoroastrians in the 1980sHaving discussed the demographics, the settlement history ofZoroastrians in Canada and the US, and some of the major com-munity issues, it is appropriate here to look at the pattern of beliefsand practices which the survey indicated in the mid-1980s.Appendix 2, Table 1 (b) shows that two-thirds, or more, ofAmerican Zoroastrians said that they prayed daily. This propor-tion was similar to that in the older diaspora groups in Britain andHong Kong, but less than in the older centres of Karachi andZoroastrians in the USA and Canada508202Parsiana, July 1986, pp. 4, 17 and Sept. 1986, pp. 7 f."},{"pageNumber":528,"pageContent":"Kenya, and less than in Australia. But there were differences inAmerica. In both Toronto and Houston there were more peoplesaying that they prayed daily (72%) than in Chicago and the scat-tered Canadian groups. Fewer American Zoroastrians in general,and those in Chicago in particular, reported that they wore thesudreandkusti, less often than did Zoroastrians in the more tradi-tional centres of London, Karachi, Kenya—or Sydney. (Thelower figures for California are readily explained by the fact thatIranian Zoroastrians attribute less significance to them than doParsis.) Within America it was respondents from Houston whomost commonly affirmed that they wore the sudreandkusti. As faras the other common religious practices of observing the festivals(gahambars) and lighting a divo are concerned, again the AmericanZoroastrians appeared to observe them less readily than did co-religionists in both the older centres and in Australia. In thisinstance such practices, particularly the gahambars, were observedwhere there were ‘centres’ such as Chicago, rather than in theAssociations which then did not have a building, for exampleHouston and the scattered groups. But very few Zoroastrians any-where said that they observed neither. A key indicator (for Parsismore than Iranian Zoroastrians) was their aspiration to have afuneral at a dokhma. In comparison with other diaspora groups theAmerican groups differed considerably, especially between theirown Associations: 20–5% in Houston and California, but only4–6% in Chicago and New York desired such a funeral. The sig-nificance of these patterns will be commented on below.Relatively few, approximately one in ten, said that they were non-practising, but a greater proportion of respondents from Chicagoand the scattered groups in Canada and US made such an asser-tion compared with Houston or California. Practising or not, anoverwhelming majority, as high as 91% (Houston), said that theyoften ate Indian or Iranian food; it was only in the scattered USgroups where the figure ‘dropped as low’ as 80%! Food is clearlya key feature of Zoroastrian life in America.Attitudes to intermarriage were, especially in the 1980s, animportant indicator of Orthodox or Reforming inclinations.More respondents from Chicago than from any other centre inthe world indicated an acceptance of intermarriage. Houstonhad, with California (the base not only of Iranian Zoroastriansbut also of a strong Orthodox Parsi group), the highest number ofZoroastrians in the USA and Canada509"},{"pageNumber":529,"pageContent":"respondents objecting to intermarriage. Once again, the widerUS, Chicago and Houston groups stood at opposite ends of theReform–Orthodox divide. Where such marriages did occur, thenagain Chicago and Houston were at opposite ends of the spec-trum on their views that priests should or should not perform theceremony. Here the Californian response was different in thatthey accepted that where intermarriages occurred, the priestscould be involved. The Chicago responses on initiating partnersor children of intermarriages, or allowing non-Zoroastrians toenter temples, were on the Reforming wing of views; Houston wason the Orthodox wing. Between those two, New York and the restof US tended to the more liberal, with Toronto in the middle.Across the continent therefore there were contrasting religiousviewpoints. How this compares with the international perspectivewill be considered in the Conclusion.Beliefs relating to life after death also varied from one group toanother. Broadly two-thirds of respondents affirmed a belief in theimmortality of the soul, but there were differences in the form ofthe belief in the afterlife. Academics assert that resurrection is thetraditional Zoroastrian belief, and that rebirth is a Hindu influenceon Zoroastrians, on Parsis in particular. It is striking that, Torontoapart (18%), few North American Zoroastrians said they believed ina resurrection, whereas approximately half of Canadian responses,and of those from Houston, affirmed a belief in resurrection.This may be taken as a marker of respondents being close to thetraditions of the Indian old country. In Chicago, by contrast, onlyone in four held this belief. Similarly, whereas in broad termsapproximately one-third of American Zoroastrians believed thatprayers for the dead are essential, only 18% in Chicago did so.Again Houston leaned towards the Orthodox wing, with 38%affirming such a belief. The majority asserted that their beliefs andpractices had not changed in the new country, though more saidthat their practices rather than their beliefs had changed.The perceptions of community relations also varied across thecontinent. Most (80\u0001%) asserted that intra-Parsi relations weregood, though the figure was somewhat lower in Chicago. InCalifornia where there was an intense Orthodox–Reform debatefigures were substantially lower. Fewer respondents in all centresthought that Parsi–Iranian relations were excellent, and the numberswere substantially lower in California and New York. In all theZoroastrians in the USA and Canada510"},{"pageNumber":530,"pageContent":"American groups, respondents affirmed that their relations withwider society were good (approximately two-thirds). Only inHouston was there a significantly smaller group making this affirma-tion. On a later visit to that city some people commented on theproblems of the Bible belt, and some referred to the Ku Klux Klan,but that information was gathered a few years after the survey. Thefigures on discrimination are interesting. In global terms moreZoroastrians from Toronto than from any other centre said that theyhad experienced discrimination. That figure requires qualification inthat on subsequent visits to follow up issues, people said that thoughthere was discrimination, it was not frequent and found mostly inemployment, especially in securing a first job. Once a person hadproved himself or herself, then they were accepted. The situationwas different in London, where the discrimination was said to be fre-quent, and substantial. In Chapter 11 the question will be addressedof why there are differences between different centres, between, say,Houston and Chicago. Are the differences simply due to the context,i.e. the local conditions, or is it that different groups of Zoroastrianswill assimilate in different ways, and that specific groups characterizethese Associations, so that internal community factors give rise todifferent patterns of belief and practice? It is also important tonote that there are commonly divergent groups within anAssociation. For example, although the survey consistently found theHouston community to be more traditional than others across thecontinent, Yezdi Rustomjee, writing the chapter on Houston’sZoroastrians in Ebaugh and Chhafetz’ book, emphasizes whatothers would consider the Reforming perspective but whoseproponents he terms ‘the progressives’. His account of purity laws,intermarriage and conversion would not be accepted by those hecalls ‘the traditionalists’ in his own community.203The 1990s: A Period of Consolidation and GrowthA time of changeSome prominent Zoroastrian leaders in the 1990s argued thatwhereas in the 1960s and 1970s the focus of attention was on sur-vival, now the time had come to view the future more confidently.Zoroastrians in the USA and Canada511203Religion and the New Immigrants, pp. 243–53 at 248."},{"pageNumber":531,"pageContent":"In 1997 Dolly Dastoor, then president of FEZANA, wrote:In my opinion we have arrived at that moment in our history on thiscontinent when we should give up our preoccupation with survival.

By the end of the1990s there were approximately 9,000 known members ofAssociations, and it was estimated that this probably representedonly a half of the real numbers in North America.206The growingsize of the Associations, and the involvement in them, is indicatedby the fact that at the turn of the millennium several were lookingfor either extensions or new properties: Chicago, New York,Vancouver and Toronto. But perhaps the biggest single factor wasthe continent-wide collaboration in an overarching or umbrellaorganization, the Federation of Zoroastrians in North America(FEZANA). As noted above, this had been a dream for many years.Rivetna was charged with the task of producing proposals for aunifying body, which was born in 1987. Each of the regionalAssociations is a member of the Federation, nineteen from USAand four from Canada—smaller and informal Associations arecorresponding members. Representatives of the Associations areon the board of directors, and votes are weighted according to thesize of the Association. There are five elected officers (president,vice-president, treasurer, secretary and assistant secretary) but theyhave no voting powers, serving only as administrators. In the earlydays, it was essential to reassure members that FEZANA would notseek to impose ‘central’ policies (e.g. on conversion or rituals), butwas rather a facilitator enabling Associations to fulfil their maxi-mum potential. The intention was, and remains, to pool resourcesand ideas to achieve more collaboratively than could be doneindividually. But FEZANA does not pass judgement on what shouldbe done locally, nor does it define policy on religion.

The vari-ous Associations supply some of their materials to help smallAssociations provide an education on Zoroastrianism to preparetheir children for growing up in America.211But this agreed‘national’ curriculum can be seen to have grown out of the work ofAssociations, for in Journal, February 1993, there had been a reviewof eighteen Associations’ curricula (pp. 12–24). This had high-lighted a huge diversity of practice, with Sunday schools involvingnumbers from six to 160, from informal—almost extempore—syllabuses, to structured programmes spanning several years.Almost all taught the kustiprayers, but what was covered underdoctrine varied enormously (discussed further below). It is throughsuch committees as this one that FEZANA carries out most of itswork. The outcomes of this review will be discussed under theheading ‘Religious edcuation’, below.In 1995 a Mission Statement was agreed, which read:The Federation of Zoroastrian Associations of North America(FEZANA) is a federation consisting of Zoroastrian Associations of theUnited States of America and Canada whose mission is:To preserve the religion of Prophet Zarathushtra.To be a strong federation committed to putting the Zoroastriancommunity firmly and clearly on the American map, and ensuring thesurvival, unity, progress and prosperity of the Zoroastrian communityon this continent, thereby preserving its religious and cultural identity.To facilitate the efforts of its Member Associations, and through themtheir individual members, in the cultivation of a model Zoroastrianenvironment in their homes and communities, where Zoroastrian valuesare promoted and nurtured, and where the teachings of Zarathushtraare imparted, lived and practised every day.To work closely in co-operation with Zoroastrian communities abroad,in deliberations for a common goal of a united world Zoroastriancommunity.To provide effective leadership in addressing the critical issues of ourtimes with wisdom and righteousness.This mission is to be achieved through the promotion of learning andunderstanding, through the clarification of any misconceptions, throughZoroastrians in the USA and Canada514210See the account of FEZANA in Journal, Summer 1996, pp. 10–16.211Journal, Fall 1996, p. 4."},{"pageNumber":534,"pageContent":"the establishment of infrastructures, by working in co-operation withother religious bodies and communities, through networking, by dissem-ination of information relating to the Zoroastrian faith and communi-ties, by guiding and co-ordinating the efforts of its member Associationswhilst respecting their individuality and inalienable rights, and withoutcompromising the everlasting message of Zarathushtra.212Growing out of this, a first ten-year Strategic Plan was pub-lished in 1997 under the presidency of Dolly Dastoor. It declaredits vision to be:To develop a Zarthushti community in North America that is well-connected, well educated, well-grounded in Zarthushti religiousthought, values and ethics, respectful of diversity, strong in collectivegiving, economically prosperous, a community which will be recognizedfor its contribution in all aspects of religious and communal life.The ten-year plan (1997–2007) identified the following four‘Shared Spaces’:1.Leading a Zarthushti Life, which opened with the words: Ouroverriding aspiration is to be identified as a distinct religious com-munity.’ It went on to stress the importance of knowing and beingable to articulate what a Zarthushti is; the organization of courses,seminars, books etc. on the religion.2.‘Thousand points of Light’—methods of mobilizing communityresources, the youth, bringing harmony within the communityand improving the economic prosperity of the community.3.Internal Infrastructuresto make Zarthushtis and their organiza-tions financially self-supporting ‘and strengthen our base as a reli-gious community’.

Some of them immediately proved difficult, for example,the council of elders, the long-term effort to achieve an agreedunified calendar and a centre for Zoroastrian studies.

Each issue has a message fromthe president, news of Associations from across the continent, espe-cially the annual general meeting and the biannual NorthAmerican Congress, international (Zoroastrian) news on inter-faithactivities, upcoming events, achievements ofAmericanZoroastrians, a matrimonial column and news of births anddeaths. Each issue has a theme. These range from religious subjectssuch as the scriptures (Winter 1998), the Gathas(Spring 1998),prayer (Fall 1999), initiation (Winter 1997); academic subjects likethe date and birth place of Zoroaster (Fall 1997); to historical mater-ial, for example the history of Iran (Summer and Fall 2000). Someissues have focused on Zarathushtis in North America, for examplethe stories of those early settlers who came to America (Spring1997), mobeds in North America (Fall 1998). There have been sup-plements on Zoroastrian businesses (Winter 1995) and professionals(Summer 1997);213Zoroastrian women past and present (Fall1994), Zoroastrian musicians (Summer 1999).

In addition to the ‘Youthfully Speaking’ section of the Journalthere have been a number of FEZANA youth activities, campingtrips,214National Youth Congresses, ski trips, a Caribbean and othercruises,215volleyball216and Olympic Games217tournaments. Suchevents are far more ambitious than could have been attempted byany Association working on its own. The first World ZoroastrianYouth Congress was held in Los Angeles in 1993.218In 1994FEZANA formed a youth section, ‘The Zarthushti Youth ofNorth America’ (ZYNA) ‘to provide the next generation ofZarthushtis with a mechanism for meaningful change’.219Theyhave been active in canvassing youth views, collecting data, makingpresentations at workshops and seminars, for example at theSeventh World Zoroastrian Congress, and campaigning for aprofessorship in Zarathushti Studies at an American university.In 2000 they organized a highly successful tour of Iran, specificallyfor the youth, and produced an inspiring video by Tanaz Dubash,In the Footsteps of our Forefathers, on the responses of these youngZarthushtis to their historic homeland. At the Congress in Houston,as well as awards to such major figures as Zubin Mehta, the WorldZarathushti Youth Award for Outstanding Leadership was made toKarman Jasavala for his role in ‘the advancement of Zarthushtifaith among the Zarathushti youth in the United Kingdom...andZoroastrians in the USA and Canada517214Journal, Nov. 1992, p. 8 regarding camping at the Yosemite National Park.

Are you ready? Change in prayer,study, religion and name.’221But the change they most commonlystress is the need to stop the bickering and quarrelling, which theysee as prominent among their elders; this in part involves loosingthe ethnic ties and uniting as Zoroastrians, a theme discussedfurther below.222From an outside perspective, it appears to me thatthe hopes of the 1970s and 1980s that many of the divisions,Orthodox–Liberal, Iranian–Parsi would fade with the second gen-eration were perhaps simplistic. Many of the youth reflect the reli-gion of their parents. But they would appear to be ready to acceptthese differences rather than fight over them, though it would benaïve to suggest that there are no debates. At the Seventh World(Millennium) Congress there were two balls, because the hotel didnot have one ballroom large enough. There was no formal separa-tion, but the elders went to one, which I attended, and the youthwent to another—which my son attended (and clearly enjoyedimmensely!). What is happening is adjustment, but at least amongthose who attended the Congress (mostly a self-selected group, ofcourse) there was no loss of pride in their history and identity. Theformal deliberations of the Congress may have achieved few, ifany, concrete proposals (see Chapter 11), but the social interaction,not least among the youth, was successful, and important. This isrelevant here, for although there were Zoroastrian youth fromother countries, it was overwhelmingly American youth whoattended. The youth ‘stream’ of the Congress tended to feature dif-ferent issues from the rest of programme. The main programmebroadly focused on theoretical issues best discussed in Chapter 11,for example, whether it was necessary for Zoroastrianism to bifurc-ate along Liberal–Orthodox lines as the Jewish community has.The youth tended to focus on the issues which confronted them,Zoroastrians in the USA and Canada518220The wording is from A Zarathushti Odyssey, the Programme of the Houston 2000 Congress,p.36.221Journal, Nov. 1992, p. 2.222See the report of the Second World Zoroastrian Youth Congress held in London,Journal, Fall 1997, pp. 47–9;Journal, Winter 1999, pp. 64–5.

The networking was perhaps the singlemost important feature not just of this Congress, but of all theyouth activities.The priesthood and religionOne of the key issues in communal discussion has been the natureand role of the priesthood on the American continent. There isonly one full-time Zoroastrian priest, Mobed Bahram Shahzadi, atthe Iranian Zoroastrian-dominated Darbe Mehr in Los Angeles(Westminster).223Until recently all Parsi priests were professionals,or businessmen, who came to America in their secular, not theirreligious, capacity, although at the end of the millennium therewere one or two coming (to Chicago and Washington) on specialreligious priests’ visas. Few, if any, anticipated the central religiousrole they would have to play. The work of the priest is especiallydifficult across such a large continent where small communities canbe hundreds of miles from a priest. The role which they areexpected to play is different from that of the mobed working full-time in an agiary in India, as it is in most diaspora communitiesand as it was in the early settlement years. It is not simply that theywork in a voluntary not a paid capacity; in America at the turn ofthe millennium, there is a demand for mobeds to undertake teach-ing and counselling roles, comparable to those provided by theChristian priests. There have also been some calls for the estab-lishment of a full-time, salaried priesthood. Various strategies havebeen adopted which merit comment. First, however, it is importantto highlight a distinctive feature of American mobeds. In Indiathere has been much discussion about the lack of a highly educatedpriesthood (Dasturs apart), and concerns have commonlybeen expressed at how few mobeds are highly educated in secularterms. The American mobeds are different. In an issue of theJournal(Fall 1998) devoted to the priesthood there is an account ofsome thirty mobeds. The most common professions are businessand accountancy (almost one in three, and including one professorZoroastrians in the USA and Canada519223Born in Yazd, he was trained in Tehran where he was made Navar. He also edits thelocal newsletter,Mah-Nameh."},{"pageNumber":539,"pageContent":"of management). Thereafter, there are computer specialists (five),people in insurance (four), students (four), with others from suchprofessions as medicine and psychology; and the issue includeseight born in America.224It would therefore be wrong to think ofAmerican mobeds as priests are perceived in India. In addition topriests who have had their navarormaratabperformed in India,American Zoroastrians have started training mobedyars, or assistantpriests. They may not be of a priestly lineage, but they are com-mitted to the religion and are trained in some of the outer rituals,such as jashansandnaujotes. Such a development has been under-taken with the approval of priests from India, but in practice theIranian Zoroastrians have taken a leading role in this. Some havequestioned whether in North America the concept of a hereditarypriesthood has any legitimacy.225Two priestly bodies have beenestablished across the continent: one is the Council of IranianMobeds of North America (CIMNA), chaired by the priestand leading philanthropist, Mobed Mehraban Zarthoshty,226and the other is the ( predominantly Parsi) North American MobedsCouncil, started in Toronto by Ervad Kobad Zarolia. Because ofthe restricted training some of them have received, and because oftime pressures in America, one theme in discussions has beenwhether major and lengthy liturgies should be standardized, andcurtailed. To this end there have been discussions about the pro-duction of a prayer-book, and of the circulation of standard ser-mon structures.227Thus far, the mobeds have refrained fromattempting to produce any liturgies significantly different fromthose in the old country.Religious educationThere have been tentative moves towards an overarching resourcesprovision, if not a religious policy. FEZANA has moved carefullyon this because it has always emphasized that the authority lies inZoroastrians in the USA and Canada520224The survey put together by Mobed Jal Birdy from California provoked discussion.He excluded Mobeds who had married out of the community because ‘their decision tomarry out portrays an ultimate betrayal of our community’,Journal, Winter 1998, p. 76.Some of the well-established priests are married out, and his list omitted some youngAmerican-born Zarathushtis.225Mazda Antia,Journal, Winter 1994, pp. 41–3.226This body has also been active in running summer camps, led primarily by MobedFariborz Shahzadi.227See e.g.Journal, Fall 1993, pp. 8, 14–21, in particular on the required qualities of aNorth American mobed."},{"pageNumber":540,"pageContent":"the Associations who constitute the board. It has however soughtto support Associations with some provisions. So, for example,Kayomarsh Mehta, as chair of FEZANA’s Religious EducationCommittee, produced an RE curriculum. First, a review wasundertaken of the great range of RE materials and programmesfollowed in the different Associations.228These varied not justbetween large Associations with relatively good resources, such asToronto, and smaller and especially newer groups, but alsobetween Iranian and Parsi (the former tended to place moreemphasis on Persian classes and the Shah Name). Virtually allincluded lessons on the prayers, but beyond that there were hugedifferences, for example, in the extent to which modern history wasincluded. At the FEZANA AGM at San Francisco in 1996,Kayomarsh Mehta and his co-chair of the Education Committee,the late Villy Gandhi:distributed a comprehensive...curriculum that outlines various aspectsof our religion: Doctrine, Scriptures, Prayers, Rituals, Ethics and History.The curriculum is distributed in six levels modeled on the format of theZoroastrian Association of Chicago. Each level can be covered in twoyears. The same curriculum can be used for Adult Education, at anaccelerated pace. For associations that cannot have six levels of classes,several levels can be grouped together to suit their needs.229To a similar end, in 1998 FEZANA published The ZarathushtiReligion: A Basic Text. This was written by Khojeste Mistree andMobed Fariborz Sohrab Shahzadi, an example of Parsi–Iraniancollaboration. The book was edited by Khojeste’s brother,Farrokh. It includes a thirty-one-page appendix of commentarieson the main text, written by individuals representing differentpoints of view. The book grew out of a wish to meet a requestfrom a Zarathushti youth at an Iranian Mobed Council religioussummer camp for a basic textbook. It is laid out with spaces sothat teachers using it can add their own notes, making it, inFarrokh Mistree’s words, ‘a living document’, although it hasgrown out of Khojeste Mistree’s book discussed in Chapter 2above,Zoroastrianism: An Ethnic Perspective. The chapter headingsindicate the basic nature of the work: ‘The prophet’; ‘ZarathushtiDoctrine and Ethics’; ‘The Ritual Spiral’; ‘Iranian Languages andZoroastrians in the USA and Canada521228Journal, Feb. 1993, pp. 12–24.229Report in Journal, Fall 1996, p. 4."},{"pageNumber":541,"pageContent":"Texts’; ‘Some Basic Prayers’; ‘Religious Calendars’; ‘The SacredFires and Priests’; ‘Some Dates in History’.

Anecdotalevidence suggests that the curriculum and the Basic Text, althoughnot universally used, are referred to and used quite widely.

The sense of ethnic/national dif-ferences can sometimes still be considerable. For example, theZoroastrian Association of Northern California decided not to cel-ebrate festivals jointly with the Persian Zoroastrian Organizationbecause, ‘we have nothing in common, the two cultures are differ-ent, we do not share the same language, even the food is quite achange...and the festivals are also celebrated in a totally differentZoroastrians in the USA and Canada522230The newly elected secretary and vice-president in 1998 were both Iranians,Journal,Fall 1998, p. 3.231Journal, Winter 1996, p. 18; Winter 1999, p. 5 reporting on a Jashan-e Mehrganwhichwas attended by Iranians of different religions.232Journal, Fall 1996, pp. 32–42.233Journal, Fall 1996, pp. 23–31.234Journal, Aug. 1993, see the articles by Shahzadi, see also Journal, Spring 1997,pp. 14 f. on two distinguished Iranian Zoroastrians, Dr Harvesf, a doctor, and K.

His friendship withProf. Kaikhusroo Irani, of Iranian ancestry but brought up inIndia, has in practice aided good relations. The problem has sur-faced more often in connection with the work of Ali Jafarey inCalifornia, in particular with regard to his acceptance of convertsof people with no Zoroastrian ancestry. Nevertheless, he has con-tributed articles to the Journal237and spoken at North AmericanCongresses. His invitation to the 2000 World Zoroastrian Congressprovoked particular hostility. The tensions between Iranians andParsis do, therefore, still exist, as witnessed by the separateAssociations in New York and California, but there is a desire notto publicize them.The California Zoroastrian Center and the ZarathushtrianAssemblyDr Ali Jafarey started his work in America during the settlementyears in California, specifically at Anaheim, in collaboration withMrs Farangis Shahrokh in the newly established CaliforniaZoroastrian Center. A first informal meeting was held on 21 May1979. The committee was composed entirely of IranianZoroastrians. There were several notable figures involved.Mrs Shahrokh was elected president; other members were DariusIrani, Mehraban Zartoshty, and Dr Rostam Sarfeh. Dr Ali Jafareyjoined the Center in October 1982.238He was controversial fromthe beginning, for various reasons. One factor was his Islamicbackground; another was his interpretation of the doctrine. Hefocused heavily on the Gathasand argued that acceptance of con-verts, if not active proselytizing, was part of the religion.

Butwhat it does not recognize is the murmuring priest who goes by rote[emphasis original] alone and does not know and understand what herecites and performs, and yet demands obedience and blind followingfrom the simple, kept-in-the-dark laity.

This and related sites will be discussed inChapter 10.The Assembly asserts that it does not convert people. It dissem-inates the divine message of Zarathushtra, and accepts those who,after due consideration, decide of their own free will to choose theGood Religion, and recognizes them as Zarathushtis through theirnaujote(sedrej pushi) ceremony.242In a photograph in theCommemorative Issue, Jafarey is shown conducting the initiationof an Englishman, a Cuban American and an Iranian.

The Zarathushtrian Assembly affirms that it neitherwishes to join nor to receive benefit from any other Zoroastrianbody, e.g. FEZANA, and some Zarathushtis therefore are contentto let them ‘do their own thing’, providing they do not impinge onother Zarathushti organizations. But when Ali Jafarey was not atfirst asked to speak at the Millennium World Congress there wasa huge outcry and protest that threatened the very occurrence ofthe Congress. In the end he was invited by FEZANA to speak ata ‘separate’ function, in the middle of the Congress, in theCongress hotel and to debate conversion with an Orthodoxteacher (Dastoor) from Mumbai. Many of my informants, includ-ing some of the Houston organizers, felt that this might lead tointerference with the Zoroastrian Associations. Despite anxietiesto the contrary, the event passed off peacefully, although a numberof American Zoroastrian leaders absented themselves from themeeting, indeed, some even from the Congress.From an external academic perspective, specifically that ofcomparative religion, the Assembly resembles some of the newreligious movements that are common, especially in California.Zoroastrians in the USA and Canada525242Passage taken from an account of the Assembly by Jehan Bagli,FEZANA MillenniumCommemorative Issue, 2000, pp. 97–9 at 98."},{"pageNumber":545,"pageContent":"Like the Krishna Consciousness Movement (or Hari Krishnas),for example, it claims to follow the teaching of the great teachersof an ancient religion in a manner appropriate for the NewWorld.

Two authors in particular meritquoting. The Editor Roshan Rivetna wrote:Here in America the question of my identity is not as clear-cut as it wasin the little Parsi world I came from. My loyalties are between callingmyself a Parsi and calling myself a Zarathushti or a Zoroastrian...Iam told ‘We should not call ourselves Parsis or Iranis, we are allZarathushtis.’ While my mind tells me that this is the right approachand I must separate my ethnicity from my religion, my heart is very sadabout the thought of giving up the Parsi appellation. I find it very difficultto make the separation. In fact I also throw my nationality into the pot—of India, the country of my birth, North America, my country of adop-tion, and sometimes also Iran where my forefathers came from, themotherland of my religion. I really think of myself as a Parsi-Indian-Iranian-North American-Zarathushti.After reflecting on what identity her children might assert she con-cludes: ‘As for me and my family, can we go back to being simplyParsis—no ifs, ands or buts?’ Later in the same issue (p. 42)Khurshid Bapasola asserted: ‘I am a Zarathushti.

Nye,Multiculturalism and Minority Religions in Britain: Krishna Consciousness,Religious Freedom, and the Politics of Location, London, 2001."},{"pageNumber":546,"pageContent":"Parsi, Indian, Citizen of the United States of America.’ There are,therefore, many layers and dimensions to the question of identity.Each of the Associations’ constitutions theoretically has toaddress the question, ‘Who is a Zarathushti?’ But of the twenty-one Associations with such constitutions in 1999, fourteenrestricted their definition to membership of the Association.244Itis generally implied that spouses and children of intermarriedscan be members (see for example the constitutions of Chicago,Toronto and Washington State). Only three specify that member-ship is restricted to those born of a Zarathushti—the TraditionalMazdayasni Anjuman in California, Houston and Quebec.But virtually all American Associations avoid defining‘Zarathushti’.245One suspects that the definition is avoided for thepractical reason of preventing disputes at the delicate time ofdrawing up a constitution, which is almost always done when anAssociation is being started. Just one Association has addressed thequestion of a definition in open debate; The ZoroastrianAssociation of British Columbia produced an agreed definitionwhere it is explicit that being a Zoroastrian is not a matter ofbirth. After three years of debates, at an EGM in 1996 more than75% of members approved a change to the constitution whichincluded the following definition of a Zoroastrian: ‘A Zoroastrianis a person who attests to be a true believer and follower of thereligion as propounded by Asho Zarathushtra in the Gathas, andwho subscribes to established Zoroastrian habitual or customarypractices.’ Membership of the Association explicitly includessomeone ‘not born of Zoroastrian parents, but who has beeninitiated into the Zoroastrian religion’.246At the opposite end ofthe spectrum is a definition proposed by Ervad Jal Birdy, as a mem-ber of ‘The Group of Concerned Zoroastrians’, which explicitlyrequires that both parents must be Zoroastrians: ‘The term“Zoroastrian” refers to a person who has descended from bothZoroastrian parents and who has been initiated into theZoroastrian religion by a traditional Sudreh-Pushin ceremony.’247My informants tell me that in practice most mobeds in Americawill initiate the offspring of an intermarried Zoroastrian,Zoroastrians in the USA and Canada527244Journal, Spring 1999, pp. 64–6. An earlier compilation was published in the Journal,Feb. 1992, pp. 16–18, before the Vancouver debate.245Parsiana, Mar. 2000, pp. 170–4.246Journal, Fall 1996, pp. 8 f.247Journal, May 1991, p. 9."},{"pageNumber":547,"pageContent":"but thus far, Joseph Peterson and the Zarathushtrian Assembly ofDr Jafarey are the only known examples of the initiation of peopleof no Zoroastrian parentage. The broader Vancouver definitionhas, therefore, yet to be tested.One dimension to this identity debate has been nomenclature.In the Winter issue of the Journal, 1996, Jamshed Udvadia pro-posed standardizing the name of the religion, and the Prophet,not along the western lines of Zoroaster and Zoroastrianism, butalong what he considered traditional Iranian lines, Zarathushtraand Zarathushtis ( p. 82). After debate at the AGM this wasadopted by FEZANA.248The gist of the argument was that aname is important, and it should not be a name determined byoutsiders who did not know the original religion, and based on afalse Greek etymology of the prophet’s name. Behind the debates,therefore, was a wish to assert their own identity in their ownwords, and the word chosen identified the community primarily inreligious terms.Although ethnicity has been, and remains for many, an import-ant aspect of their persona, religion has played a high profile inthe Associations and in FEZANA. This has been noted in con-nection with the importance attached to religious education forthe young and not so young. But the concern is not simply witheducation. For example, in the Winter 1998 issue of the Journal(p. 3) the incoming president, Framroze Patel, discussed whichprayers should be recited at the start of which sort of Associationand Federation meetings. Similarly, in his column in the Winter1999 issue the president, in introducing an issue on socio-religiousissues, concluded, ‘At FEZANA, let all our actions be made inaccordance with the admonition of the Prophet’ ( p. 5). The ques-tion of ‘what prayers are appropriate when’ was discussed at somelength in the Fall 1999 issue of the Journal( pp. 28–39), guest-edited by Kersey Antia. One young Zarathushti, Aysha Ghadiali,described the difference between herself and her Indian Parsifriends in terms of knowing and ‘doing’ the religion. She wrote:We, the young Zarathushtis of North America, are less apt to pray, wearour sudre and kushti, cook traditional meals and know the traditions andcustoms compared to our counterparts in Iran or India. However, if youZoroastrians in the USA and Canada528248See the announcement, Fall 1997, p. 7. Udvadia’s argument was reproduced in fullin the Journal, Spring 1999, pp. 8 f."},{"pageNumber":548,"pageContent":"asked us to explain what being a Zarathushti means, what our history isand what the religion preaches to lead a good life, we may prove overallto have a greater understanding of the religion...This may beexplained as a cultural difference. We don’t live near agiaries or atashbehrams, and though we are also a minority in India and Iran, here wehave to constantly explain ourselves. We, in North America must knowhow to explain our religion because we are constantly asked to by ourpeers, colleagues and elders at school or work.But ‘knowing about’ is seen as also ‘doing’, as Ms Ghadiali put it;it is also important to have the ‘spiritual life’. It would be over-simplistic for this book to present the American Zarathushtis asfocusing only on knowledge about the religion; many also emphas-ize the practice of prayer, and stress that worship as well as RE isimportant. Practice and worship are perhaps stressed more at theend of the millennium than they were in the social gatherings ofthe 1960s that laid the foundations for the Associations.Inter-faith activitiesThe urge to learn about, and to practise, the religion has not led theZarathushtis to isolate themselves from other religions. Indeed, theAmericans have probably engaged in inter-faith activities more fullythan have Zoroastrians in other countries, except perhaps in Britainin the late 1990s. This has been a prominent feature of FEZANAand the Associations throughout the 1990s. At the start of thedecade, the Zoroastrians (as they were then known) were prominentin the 1993 World Parliament of Religions, led by RohintonRivetna, a ‘Founding Trustee’ of the Parliament. The JournalforNovember 1992 ( p. 9) encouraged Zoroastrians to apply to read apaper.249The actual event was covered in some detail in the Winter1993Journal( pp. 14–39), including the series ofjashansorganized in Zoroastrian communities around the world to mark the event.A number of Zoroastrian figures were among the 7,000 represent-atives of the 150 religions: they included Dastur JamaspAsa,Dr Ramiya Karanjia, then assistant principal of the AthornanMadressa in Bombay, Dr Homi Dhalla and Padma Shri HomiTaleyarkhan from Bombay; and from Iran, Dastur Dr JehangirOshidari, vice-president of the Mobed Council of Tehran. Therewere twenty-six papers by Zoroastrians (some speakers gave twoZoroastrians in the USA and Canada529249The Aug. 1993 issue (pp. 10 f.) gave a report on the 1893 Parliament and the unclearaccounts of Zoroastrian participation and whether this actually involved attendance."},{"pageNumber":549,"pageContent":"papers), and Dastur JamaspAsa, who was one of the fourteenpresidents of the Parliament, gave an invocation in the closing cere-monies. It was seen by FEZANA as ensuring ‘that Zarthustis tookits [sic] rightful place alongside other major religions of the world’( p. 14). A letter of appreciation of Rivetna’s role was published byJ. Modi, which said, ‘In one stroke, Zoroastrianism found itselfseated amongst the world’s most renowned religious groups andframed for posterity in the full glare of international spotlight.’250Rivetna went on to play a leading part in organizing the 1999World Parliament in South Africa, as a trustee of the Council for aParliament of the World’s Religions (CPWR).251Rivetna, as theperson in FEZANA responsible for external affairs, was involved inanother high-profile event: he negotiated a role for Zoroastrians atthe inter-faith service at the fiftieth anniversary of the UnitedNations in the Grace Cathedral in San Francisco. The principles ofthe charter were reaffirmed in the presence of President Clintonand other world leaders. Dastur JamaspAsa’s message was printedin the programme and a Parsi priest took part in the procession;Zoroastrians were involved in the two-day seminar at Berkeley thatfollowed. Zoroastrians also participated in the associated inter-faithconference for youth.252At another fiftieth UN anniversary func-tion, this time in New York, Dastur Firoze Kotwal was an invitedspeaker at a two-day symposium and an inter-faith celebration atNew York’s Cathedral of St John.253Rivetna was involved in 1996 in starting a religious group withsome parallels to the United Nations—the United Religions—andhe started their newsletter,Religions Together.254The following year,1997, FEZANA was granted Non-Governmental Organization(NGO) status at the UN, the fulfilment of a dream Parsis had heldfor some time. In 1998 they were asked to designate their repre-sentatives, who were then given passes to attend meetings at theUN concerned with economic and social matters.255The purposeZoroastrians in the USA and Canada530250Journal, Winter 1993, p. 47.251Journal, Winter 1998, p. 15.252Journal, Fall 1995, pp. 32–7.253Journal, Winter 1995, p. 14.254Journal, Fall 1996, p. 9.

However, at the close of the millenniumthere were signs that the level of inter-faith activity in Americais declining. My informants relate that there has been littleinvolvement of the Zarathushtis as an NGO body of the UN,and that few Associations are taking active or leadership roles ininter-faith groups, not least because of the demands of time thesemake, for little evident, immediate benefit.Academic study of ZoroastrianismZoroastrians on the American continent have had closer links withacademics than have any other group. This was noted above,especially in connection with New York (see ‘Religious educa-tion’). It has been maintained through the 1990s at a nationallevel, though communal pride has been expressed in the promi-nence given to scholars, professional and ‘private’, from within thecommunity, notably Prof. Kaikhosrov Irani and Prof. FarhangMehr. Dr Pallan Ichaporia, who worked with the German linguistProf. Dr Helmut Humbach, has organized academic seminars onthe Avesta and the Yashts, and edited a new journal, forFEZANA,The Journal of the Research and Historical PreservationCommittee. This started in 1995, but only a limited number ofissues appeared. The journal Humata, started in 1997 and editedby Farhang Mehr and Kaikhusroo Irani, is a product of theCenter for Ancient Iranian Studies, and has been published eachyear until 2000. The intention was to publish quarterly at each ofthe major Iranian festivals. It is distinctive for having a regular andsubstantial proportion of its contents in Farsi. The contributorsare all Zoroastrians, both Iranian and Parsi, though all might bedescribed as belonging more to the Liberal wing of the community.Some articles have a straight historical focus, but others areZoroastrians in the USA and Canada531256See e.g.Journal, Winter 1997, p. 16. and the protests over a film on general release,Wishmaster, which associated Zoroastrianism with evil and sorcery. The protests wereignored by the film-makers.257Journal, Winter 1996, p. 12."},{"pageNumber":551,"pageContent":"concerned with the practice of the ancient religion in the modernworld.258Another Anglo-Persian publication is Iran Zamin,pro-duced by Fariborz Rahnamoon from Vancouver. It is the publica-tion of the Ancient Iranian Cultural and Religious Research andDevelopment Center; the English section is available on theCenter’s website (www.ancientiran.com). Most articles are writtenby Iranian Zoroastrians.A number of individuals who have professional careers alsowork industriously as private scholars, for example SaroshManeckshaw, who has dedicated much of his private time tostudy, as has the research chemist Dr Jehan Bagli. Dr KerseyAntia, the priest from Chicago who initiated Peterson, in his youthhad studied Avesta and Pahlavi with Dastur Kotwal in Bombay. AParsi scholar who emerged into greater prominence at the end ofthe 1990s is Prof. Jamsheed Chocksy. This Parsi of Sri Lankanancestry studied for his Ph.D. at Harvard with the distinguishedIranologist R. N. Frye, has a professorship at Indiana Universityand was honoured for his scholarship by the community at aNorth American Congress. In publications, and at Gatha259orAvesta260conferences, the Zarathushtis seek to balance their ownscholars with non-Zarathushtis, for example Frye, Hinnells,Humbach, Malandra, Schwartz and Windfuhr. They have alsoheld symposia at Harvard,261and lobbied successfully for sessionson Zoroastrianism at the American Academy of Religion.262Thefundamental conviction of these highly educated Zoroastrians isthat scholarly knowledge is important for both their own and theirchildren’s understanding of their heritage, and for the perpetua-tion of that inheritance. They are also convinced that theirscholars can, and should, work with the non-Zoroastrian academyin the ‘outside’ world. But the picture is not uniform. There areZarathushtis who resent outside western scholarly influence, aZoroastrians in the USA and Canada532258For the former see K. R. Bhote, ‘Seminal Contributions of Ancient Iran to WorldCivilizations’,Humata, Fall 1997, pp. 34–41.

For example, at the World Congress in Houston,there was not a single non-Zoroastrian speaker, the outcome ofsome fierce Internet disputes. But it is not only at this Congressthat the trend is to be observed. In the 1980s Jamshed Pavriattacked bitterly a publication of Mary Boyce, for saying thatZoroaster had three wives, and that next-of-kin marriage was partof ancient Iranian tradition, points accepted by most western aca-demics. Looking through newsletters from the 1990s of New Yorkand Toronto, places where such speakers were commonly invited,one can see that there has been a noticeable decline in the num-ber of non-Zoroastrian speakers at local, as well as (inter)national,level. In part this may be a reaction against some individuals whohave been thought to seek undue influence, and in part a growingreliance on community members. In my opinion, as an outsideacademic, it would be sad if the outstanding collaborative atti-tudes of the earlier years declined; for Zoroastrians, more thanany other diaspora group, have worked substantially, frequentlyand harmoniously with the academic world. This decline incollaboration is more evident in America than in Britain.Zarathushti business networksA distinctive feature of Zarathushti developments in the 1990s hasbeen the growth of the business network. The Journalfor Fall 1993announced the production of a directory of Zoroastrian busi-nesses and professionals as a first step in developing a network toimprove business relationships between Zarathushtis and to pro-mote community development. The news item was prefixed bythe appeal ‘Please support our Zoroastrian entrepreneurs’ ( p. 13).FEZANA published a sample of Zarathushti business and enter-prises, in anticipation of a later comprehensive directory.263Thefirst Zarathushti Business Conference, spearheaded by RohintonRivetna and Farshid Salamati, was held in Las Vegas in 1997 withparticipants ranging from Jamsheed Marker, the formerAmbassador to Washington and the UN, to young people who hadonly started their business four months earlier. The declared aimwas ‘prepar[ing] a tool for a further networking system for the ben-efit of our community’. In part there was guidance and advice fromZoroastrians in the USA and Canada533263Journal, Winter 1995, pp. 37–91."},{"pageNumber":553,"pageContent":"from the experienced, as well as offers and appeals for collabora-tion.264A further business conference was held a year later, againin Las Vegas, where plans were laid to start a ZarathushtiChamber of Commerce.265This was inaugurated at the WorldCongress in Houston 2000 and had four initial directors: SaroshCollector, Homi Davier, Rohinton Rivetna and Kobad Zarolia.266After the Congress the Zarathushti Women’s InternationalNetwork (ZWIN) was born. It is a web-based network to supportand encourage women in diverse ways.Some issues addressed in the years of growthThus far attention has been focused on what steps FEZANA hastaken. It is also important to look at what issues it has addressed.One that occupied much of its time in the early years was theobservance of an agreed calendar. This was a difficult issue,because the Fasli calendar was the one most easily followed in theWest, being based on the Gregorian, but in India the great major-ity follow the Shenshahi calendar, which is itself different fromthat used in Iran (the Qadmis, also observed by a minority ofParsis). Diaspora Zoroastrians have generally been reluctant tofollow a calendar different from the old country, not simplybecause of sentiment, though that is important, but also for thepractical reason that being out of step with the old country canresult in families celebrating the great festivals at different times.The subject has been discussed in many issues of the Journal, andthere is broad support for the Fasli calendar because of its inte-gration into the western calendar, but FEZANA has taken no offi-cial position and even in its Millennium Commemorative Issueof theJournalstill uses Fasli, Shenshai and Qadmi dates.Behind much FEZANA discussion lies the (half ) implied beliefthat the Zarathushtis of the New World are in one sense, at least,the ( potential) leaders of the Zoroastrian world. This belief wasnoted earlier in the chapter in the section on the Associations, andcontinued in the 1990s. At the seventh North American CongressZoroastrians in the USA and Canada534264Journal, Winter 1997, pp. 72–7.265Journal, Spring 1999, p. 79. A chapter was opened in Delhi on 23 Jan. 2003. SeeParsiana, Mar. 2003, pp. 42–64.266The last name, Zarolia, highlights one of the distinctive features of North Americanmobeds commented on above, for Zarolia was also a pioneer of the Council of Mobeds.The roles of priests in Zoroastrian society in India and America are very different."},{"pageNumber":554,"pageContent":"in Houston in 1990 it was reported: ‘It is quite conceivable that inthe future the focus on Zoroastrianism may shift from Indiato North America and FEZANA may then provide a WorldZoroastrian Democratic leadership.’267When it was decided tohold the millennium World Zoroastrian Congress in Houston, theeditor of the ‘Youthfully Speaking’ section of the Journalreportedthe president Dolly Dastoor as asserting: ‘The World Congress tobe held in Houston, Texas, is the first step to showing our brethrenin Iran and India, that North America is indeed the new home-land of the Zarathusti culture.’268This conviction has appearedalso in the attempt to set up a world body. The WZO will be dis-cussed in Chapter 10, but frustration at its constitution, whichrecognizes only individual membership, giving individuals thesame voting rights as large bodies like the BPP, triggered moves tostart a World Council of Federations (WCZF) along the lines ofFEZANA, led by Rivetna.269After discussions with WZO andother interested parties in America (in 1993, after the WorldParliament took the opportunity of having a number of overseasvisitors), and with the Federation in India,270an internationaldialogue ensued. Eventually FEZANA itself backed away fromestablishing a second body, but again called for more discussions.271In these moves, American Zoroastrians were seen to be at theforefront of international developments in Zoroastrianism.FEZANA in perspectiveDr Rustom Kevala, by profession a rocket scientist, wrote an edi-torial in the Journal, August 1991, on ‘What led to the birth ofFEZANA?’ It is worth quoting at length because it gives a per-sonal picture of the changing nature of the Zarathushti ‘commu-nity’ in America:FEZANA was founded to provide synergism, and a louder voice, to thetiny Zarthushti community on this continent. Because it exists, it repres-ents all Zarthushtis in North America...by its very existence, it pro-vides a common platform to all of us, and it represents the longings andthe goals of the 10,000 American Zarthushtis to the millions of otherAmericans, and to the thousands of other Zarthushtis spread all overthe world.Zoroastrians in the USA and Canada535267Journal, Dec. 1990, p. 2.268Journal, Fall 1997, p. 47.269Journal, Spring 1997, p. 14; Spring 1998, p. 3.270Journal, Spring 1998, p. 19.271Journal, Fall 1999, pp. 11 f."},{"pageNumber":555,"pageContent":"But FEZANA is more than that. The birth of FEZANA signifies anawakening of a sense of purpose within the Zarthushti community inNorth America. Its existence represents a real shift in our needs. Thereis a realization that the local associations cannot meet all our needs. Wehave to try to define these needs through rhetoric, congresses and con-ferences, without coming to a consensus. Even though some among usthink they know the solutions to our problems, and others think there areno problems, the mechanism for defining the problems and implement-ing solutions still eludes us.Back in 1967, when I moved to Chicago with my wife and 2-year-olddaughter, there were 20 or 30 Zarthushti families already settled inChicago-land One of them took a day off and showed us aroundChicago to help us find an apartment. After we were settled, we got toknow all the Zarthushtis in Chicago, and formed many lasting friend-ships. Later we moved to Boston and then to Washington, and formedsimilar friendships.These groups had a strong need to get together often. They were notall that interested in the Zarathushti religion, though that was clearly thecommon link. There was no mention of studying the Gathas, or pro-viding religious education for the children, or improving Parsi–Iranirelations. Few among us had the time to study the Gathas, the childrenwere too young, and there were no community assets or religious dis-cussions to spoil relations. They did not even consider building meetinghalls or places of worship. They met at the Little House of Glencoe, orsome other picnic spot. But the fellowship did provide a sense of com-munity and a chance for being with people who just naturally felt com-fortable with one another. There were common goals (to get ahead inwestern society), common tastes (dhansak), and a common concept of whatour religion stood for (good thoughts, good words, good deeds). We hadgood jobs, we knew that our children would have the best opportunitiesfor learning and growth, and we knew that we all had bright futuresahead for us.Twenty years later, things were very different. Some of us clearly hadhad a better chance in reaching one or more of our aspirations; butthere was a price to pay. There was something missing. The childrenhad grown up. And there was strife. Those who had good jobs had pros-pered by immersing themselves in their work, to find they had neglectedtheir children’s and their own spiritual needs. Those who had continuedto socialize with other Zarthushtis had found fulfillment in their familylives, but found themselves isolated from the American mainstream.Those who had married American-born spouses had becomeAmericanized, at the expense of losing old contacts and even friend-ships. And most of these Zarathushtis in America felt an inner emptinessZoroastrians in the USA and Canada536"},{"pageNumber":556,"pageContent":"without the religious edifices and support networks they had left behindin India, Pakistan and Iran.Of course this is an oversimplification. The picture is not as clear anddramatic. But this is how I can put it in this limited column.And that is why FEZANA was born. We must give this baby a chance.Perhaps this baby can grow up to be our salvation!272In the following issue the then President, Rohinton Rivetna,outlined his vision for the future of FEZANA and then identifiedthe specific tasks and grave issues ahead.There are many tasks that lie ahead. Some that come to mind are: reli-gious education for our children, our youth, and our adults; developinginformational materials on Zoroastrianism; developing a cadre of spiri-tual leaders and Mobeds versed in the doctrinal, ritual and ministerialaspects; establishment of a seminary and North American Center;social welfare for the needy and aged both within the Zoroastrian com-munity and outside; facilitating marriages within the faith; keepingour flock together; projecting a better understanding of our faith to oth-ers through participation in inter-faith activities; and encouragingentrepreneurship.Also, there are many grave issues that need to be addressed. We cannotsit back and wait for their miraculous disappearance. Some of these are:marriages between Zoroastrians and non-Zoroastrians; acceptance/non acceptance of spouses and children of such marriages; conversion/acceptance; declining world population and North American demograph-ics; promoting Parsee–Irani understanding; and adoption of a unifiedcalendar.It is worth looking back over the 1990s to assess the fulfilmentof these desires, with a reflection from the then President,Dolly Dastoor, on the first seven years:In the short span of 7 years much has been achieved, many instrumentshave been started to bring about cohesiveness e.g. our combined efforts todevelop a mission for ourselves, a unified calendar, and our demographicprofile, help to the Zarthushti refugees from Iran, the Journal, thecongresses, the Olympics, the business network, the youth network, thewomen’s network, our presence at the Parliament of World’s religions and other international meetings and more. But the most importantZoroastrians in the USA and Canada537272Kevala wrote a moving piece in Journal, Spring 1997, p. 4 on how, despite his pro-fessional success, he had not found happiness until he found his place in the Zoroastriancommunity."},{"pageNumber":557,"pageContent":"achievement is that we are talking to each other, we support each other anddraw from the strength and talents of each other.273Dastoor is right in stressing the achievements of FEZANA in whatis a relatively short space of time. Its co-ordinating role has facilit-ated ventures, from academic congresses to ski trips, that noAssociation working alone could have done. Without being pre-scriptive it has produced guidelines and material for religiouseducation. The networking among the youth is striking, so that thestory is not simply of out-marriage. The mobeds have addressedproblems together, and there are several young America-bornmobeds. Inter-faith activities were noteworthy in the mid-1990s,but less evident at the end of the millennium. The meetings ofbusinessmen and the formation of a Chamber of Commerce arefoundations for wider collaboration in the future. Parsi–Iraniantensions remain, indeed, they became acute in the planning of theSeventh World Congress, as we shall see in Chapter 10. But muchhas been achieved, and the achievement is encapsulated in, butnot restricted to, the collaboration over a basic religious text.Writing as someone who has lived with American Zoroastrianfamilies many times and in eight cities from the early 1980sthrough to 2001, and who has attended the acrimonious Congressin Los Angeles, the birth of FEZANA at Toronto, and then themillennium conference (plus smaller meetings in between), whatstrikes me as an outsider is how things have changed, and how theinfrastructure, be that buildings or committees, has grown to man-age that change. The Congress platforms are still dominated bythe pioneers of the early years, but some of the youth, and morerecent arrivals, are being heard. Individuals whom I have seendisputing violently now speak of ‘disagreeing agreeably’. The dis-putes can still be conducted with a level of ferocity that can makethe outsider (this one anyway!) want to shrink away, and, what isfar more serious, alienate many of the youth. But the fact remainsthat for all the tensions and all the problems, the Associations co-operate for the good of the community: some of them are verytraditional, others are clearly Reforming; in New York, CaliforniaZoroastrians in the USA and Canada538273Journal, Spring 1995, p. 3. See also the editor’s column, Spring 1996, p. 2. Itdescribed 1995 as a watershed with participation in the UN50 which ‘gave us tremendousexposure and self-confidence in our future’. The issue of the Journalon Zarathushti enter-prise ‘showed our surprising strength in the North American business arena’. The stagingof the Youth Congress in San Francisco was also seen as a major advance."},{"pageNumber":558,"pageContent":"and Toronto there are still separate Iranian Associations. Butdespite the clashes they still collaborate, for example in seeking anew centre together in New York. Yet Kevala still asked in theMillennium Commemorative Issuewhat FEZANA had achieved. He,and others, still consider that the community, continent-wide, is ata crossroads.274Particular note needs to taken of the role of the Journal. It hasgrown from an original print-run of fifty to a regular subscriptionlist of 1,500.275Although for many the important dimension ofthe Zoroastrian community is local socializing, food and friend-ship, the Journalgives a truly continent-wide dimension to theAssociation. Its tone seeks to be, and is, positive. It occasionallyreflects some of the struggles faced by individuals and groups asthey seek to settle in the New World.

Seen from this perspec-tive it is the most recent of all the diaspora groups studied thus far.Nevertheless the history of Zoroastrians in the North Americancontinent is complex because of the number, geographical spreadZoroastrians in the USA and Canada539274pp. 5, 91.

The key turning pointsafter the opening of the door for immigration of people from Asiain 1963 into Canada and 1965 into the USA were the early years ofthe formation of Associations in the late 1960s and early 1970s; thelaunch of a ‘newsletter’ with significant religious content (Gavashniin 1974); the start of the building programme for Darbe Mehrs,beginning with New York in 1977; and the arrival of IranianZoroastrians in the 1980s. There have been tensions in severalAssociations, but the Parsi–Iranian clash gained prominence in1986 with the split in New York between ZAGNY and the IranianZoroastrian Association. Individual events of significance have beenthe Peterson naujotein 1983, which was the tip of the iceberg of thedebate on conversion, a debate which again came to prominence in1990 with the founding of the Zarathushtrian Assembly by Dr AliJafarey. The film Wings of Firelaunched in 1981 (first screened in1985) was one of a number of focal points for doctrinal debates. Interms of collaboration and administration the establishment ofFEZANA in 1987 was a key turning point. Important publishingventures were the launch of the Persian journal Payk-e-Mehrin 1987and the FEZANA Journalin 1988. Concern for the youth has beena characteristic of all Associations virtually from their inception;perhaps the key moment in North America was the first YouthCongress in Los Angeles, 1987 and the start of the youth wing ofFEZANA in 1994. A distinctive feature of the 1990s was theinvolvement in inter-faith activities. There had been earlier localmoves, but the role of the Zoroastrians in the World Parliament ofReligions in 1993 was significant. The launch of the firstZarathushti business network is something that many hope willcome to be regarded as another key moment. The holding of theSeventh World Zoroastrian Congress in Houston 2000, whichstarted the new millennium with American Zoroastrians movingtowards centre stage, is seen by many as particularly important.North American Zoroastrians have a number of distinctivefeatures. The Canadian Zoroastrians feel less culturally threatenedby the Canadian Government’s multiculturalism programme thanthe Zoroastrians in the USA do by the image of the melting pot.That policy was first articulated to encourage Europeans tointegrate, and may have been a myth, but the message in the mythof the pressure to become ‘all-American’ was a major factor in poli-cies evolved in the early settlement years especially for ZoroastriansZoroastrians in the USA and Canada540"},{"pageNumber":560,"pageContent":"in the USA. In reaction to this, and reflecting the very high levels ofeducation and involvement of so many experienced and seniorpeople from many big corporations, America (including Canada)has evolved ‘bigger and better’ (to use the widespread popularimage of America) religious education and youth programmes thananywhere else. Education and concerns for the youth are part of theearliest history of the Zoroastrian communities in Karachi andLondon, but the continent-wide collaboration through FEZANAhas enabled more grand-scale events, such as the regular YouthCongresses, and social functions such as skiing, Caribbean cruisesand biennial Congresses.277The speed with which Zoroastrianbuildings were opened across the continent was a result of two fac-tors, one being the presence in America and Canada of majorbenefactors, namely Arbab Rustom Guiv and the Zarthoshtibrothers. The programme was also due to the determination of thevarious Associations to make long-term provision for theircommunities, being aware from the outset that these predominantlyyoung Zoroastrian populations had come to stay. There was no‘myth of return’ among North American Zoroastrians. The vastdistances between Associations have propelled them into a pioneer-ing Federation forming an umbrella organization to facilitate col-laboration. It is only in the USA that there is a policy for acceptingconverts, specifically, and from a religious studies perspective notsurprisingly, in California with the Zarathushtrian Assembly. Thefounding of priestly organizations, both Parsi and Iranian, todebate the provision of religious services across the continent isanother feature of the high level of organizational concern, as tooare the business networks. Such activities are observable elsewhere,ZTFE for example, but they have a higher profile in NorthAmerica. The level of religious activity increased in London in the1990s, but it was a distinctive feature of the North American com-munities from early times, and is more apparent, as we shall see,than in Australia. There have been tensions between Parsis andIranian Zoroastrians in various countries, but they have greaterprominence in North America because more Iranian Zoroastrianrefugees and migrants came to Canada (Vancouver and Toronto)and America (California) than anywhere else.

There have, for example, been disputes about non-Zoroastrian spouses present at muktadceremonies in many coun-tries, but these have had a smaller impact in North America than inZTFE. Non-Zoroastrian spouses are included in more functions inmost Associations than in other countries.But it is dangerous to generalize about the North Americans, forthe Associations are different. The obvious contrasts are betweenthe Zarathushtrian Assembly and the traditional ZoroastrianAnjuman, both in California. But these groups were formed for spe-cific and contrasting reasons. Across the continent Associations aredifferent, the obvious examples being ‘liberal’ Chicago and ‘tradi-tional’ Houston. Toronto, the largest Association on the continent,is inevitably different in the range of its provisions for its members,especially in such things as social functions and religious pro-grammes, from some of the newer and much smaller Associations.As ZTFE has seen itself as a major international centre because ofits place at the heart of empire, so now many North AmericanZoroastrians see themselves as future leaders of Zoroastrianismworldwide. They also see religion as an important part of their per-sonal and communal identity. For example, at the Toronto AGM in1993 a task force was set up to advise on the problems of assimila-tion and the preservation of identity in North America. The result-ing report considered the ‘big picture’ of demographic decline, thefrequency and consequences of intermarriage, but as on previousoccasions in Toronto particular attention was given to religiouspractice and in an Appendix the task force drew up an unusualdocument—something not done in India—advising people on whatthe daily religious practices should be. They emphasized four activ-ities. First, people should set aside a religious corner or room in thehouse ‘where such religious artifacts such as an oil lamp, portrait ofthe Prophet, incense burner etc. are kept’. The second activity was‘wearing the Sudreh and Kusti and reciting Kusti prayers eachmorning and night, and where practicable, before meals and afterusing the washroom’. Third, family members should ‘recite at aminimum, the Srosh Baj prayers before embarking on the day’sactivities and before retiring at night’. Finally they recommended‘lighting a fire and censering the house by burning incense andsandalwood on appropriate days’.Zoroastrians in the USA and Canada542"},{"pageNumber":562,"pageContent":"9Zoroastrians in AustraliaThe Context: Asian Migration to AustraliaThe White Australia policyAlthough there was some South Asian migration to Australia inthe nineteenth century, numbers were few: servants on ships, somelabourers and merchants.1, 2From the late nineteenth century1I wish to record my profound thanks to Sarah Longair for undertaking a research visitin July–Aug. 2000, when I was unable to go, to collect material to update the chapter fromthe details I had gathered on my visit in 1988 and through correspondence.

The term was first usedin the 1880s. It was cast in legislation in the CommonwealthImmigration Restriction Act of 1901, and was the policy of theAustralian Labor Party—the first national social democratic gov-ernment in the world—and of its affiliate, the Australian Workers’Union. The aim was to achieve an ethnically homogeneous soci-ety, and it was based on contemporary fashionable racial attitudes.Non-Europeans, especially the Aborigines, were considered oflower racial stock, so it was thought that intermarriage woulddebase the White population. Attempts were therefore made to‘save the mixed race, if necessary by removing them from homeand community’.3Based on the assumption that the Aboriginesand remaining numbers of a nineteenth-century Chinese com-munity would die out, Australia sought to develop its populationby attracting British migrants. Although Irish migrants were oftenCatholic, generally the population of Australia was seen as beingWhite, British and Protestant. Australia insulated herself fromthe immediate region and strengthened her ties with the seat ofempire on the other side of the world. For 150 years (1831–1982)Australian public funds were used to facilitate an assisted passages scheme for British migrants. Australia, more than otherCommonwealth countries, gave a high priority to immigration,but that was immigration from one sending country, Britain. Inthe 1940s such schemes were also agreed with the Netherlands,Eire and displaced persons from the Balkan nations and, in the1950s and 1960s, with prospective immigrants from Hungary andCzechoslovakia.4After the Second World WarIn the early years after the Second World War, Australia providedan attractive destination for those from war-torn Britain, but asBritain’s economic situation improved so fewer migrated to thesouthern hemisphere. Initially, Australia turned to other sendingcountries in Europe, including the south and east of the continent.The Australian aim was to achieve growth through expansion ofthe workforce and of the consumer base. This peaked in 1969–70with 185,000 settler arrivals; most were still from Britain. Youngerworkers were sought who would increase the population forZoroastrians in Australia5443Jupp,Immigration,p.83.4Atchison, ‘Patterns’, pp. 11 f."},{"pageNumber":564,"pageContent":"defensive purposes in case of an invasion from Asia, as well as todevelop the economy and to provide resources for the socialservices.5British immigration was not restricted until 1975. Otherdevelopments were also weakening the link to the ‘mother country’.These included: the evident lack of wisdom in having such a closetie to a country on the other side of the world which no longerruled a global empire; British entry into the European market; thedecrease in British investment in Australia; and the Vietnam War,which tied Australia more into the Pacific region. As Canada andthe United States began to open their doors to Asian migration,and as newly independent states protested at the White Australiapolicies, so Australian policy on immigration also changed. Anearly indication, in the mid-1950s, of a more ‘liberal’ policy wasthat the non-European partner in a mixed-race marriage wasallowed to apply for citizenship after fifteen years residencein Australia.6But for the next twenty to thirty years liberalism inimmigration meant accepting more south and east Europeansand towards the end of this period some eastern Mediterraneanpeople. The conscious inclusion of Asian migrants came later still.This is reflected in some of the scholarly literature on Australia;see, for example, Jayasuriya, who criticizes writers for not disag-gregating the data relating to ethnic minorities. But he himself onlydisaggregates the term ‘Asian’ when writing of refugees.7It wasbecoming increasingly apparent that the Pacific region and Asia would become ever more important to the Australianeconomy. The key development was the 1972 election of theWhitlam Labor Government, which a year later declared thatfuture admissions would be based on a universal policy, ignoringrace, ethnicity, religion or cultural background.8However, thatGovernment reduced the number of immigrants and, significantlyin this context, thereby reduced the number of Asians settling inAustralia. The new Liberal–National Country Party CoalitionGovernment elected in 1975 was conservative in many areas, butliberal in immigration, which it saw as of benefit for AustralianZoroastrians in Australia5455Ibid.6Jupp,Immigration,p.85.7Jayasuriya, ‘Immigration Policies and Ethnic Relations in Australia’, in Dwivedi,Canada 2000.8See espe.

The search for an equitable admissionspolicy took many turns, but the general priority was given tofamily reunification. Policies were generally more cautious thanin Canada.9In 1979 a system approximating to the Canadianpoints system was introduced to determine which applicants wereappropriate for immigration, whatever their nationality, thoughEnglish-speaking skills and narrowly defined occupational skills,and the priority given to non-dependent families, still favouredBritish applicants. From the mid-1970s the proportion of Asianmigrants increased. The main four sending countries wereIndia, (mainland) China, Malaysia and the Philippines. Relativelyfew came from Pakistan. The figures for 1981, 1986 and 1991 aregiven in Table 9.1.10Inevitably the number of settlers variedfrom year to year, according to local economic considerations, butAustralia, more than Britain, has been willing to accept migrantsat times of recession with the aim of improving the economicsituation.One of the fears behind earlier immigration policy had beenthat Asians would be poorly educated, with depressed workingand living conditions. In fact migration from Asia, with the excep-tion of Indo-China (Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia), has been ofthe well-educated, middle-class achievers, with 44.3% of peopleZoroastrians in Australia5469See Hawkins,Critical Years, chs. 3 and 5.10Figures for earlier years are in Hawkins,Critical Years, p. 265.

A higher proportion of such migrantsare married than are the White Australians, more have youngerchildren and there is a lower divorce rate. The family bonds aretherefore strong.12Australian MulticulturalismUnlike Canada, Australia has not evolved a formal, coherentpolicy of multiculturalism, but there has rather been a plethora ofprogrammes, mostly short-term, and generally formulated severalyears later than in Canada.13By the mid-1970s Australia wasdeveloping the sort of race-free immigration controls thatCanada had achieved in the previous decade. Also at this time theemphasis shifted from simple control of immigration, to concernwith post-arrival settlement services. The term ‘multiculturalism’was becoming widely accepted. In Australia this had a threefoldfocus: community languages, the creation of a tolerant, non-discriminatory society enriched by and sensitive to diversity, andthe goal of equity and participation to offset inequality and dis-advantage. In the early 1970s there was no national body to speakfor non-British migrants. In 1975 state-wide ethnic communitycouncils were started, with New South Wales as the strongest, andby 1979 all states had such councils. A federation of these councilswas organized with its headquarters in Sydney. In the 1980s offi-cial support was given for community languages and a ResearchInstitute was established to refine the concept of multiculturalismZoroastrians in Australia54711Jupp,Immigration, pp. 213 f.12Bilimoria, pp. 733 f. The most formal statement was a Labor Government document,Our Nation: Multicultural Australia and the 21st Century, Canberra, 1999. But the Labor Partylost the next election and there have been public protests during electioneering aganist‘liberal’ immigration policies.13On Australian policy on religion and culture see G.

So, for example, a survey in 1984 found that62% of Australians disapproved of increased Asian migration.16At the local level of state politics resistance to immigrant groups con-tinued and was often manifest in opposition to planning applica-tions for centres of worship, as experienced by the OrthodoxChurch, Muslim, Buddhist and Hindu groups. In the mid-1980sone city council declared itself to be a ‘mosque-free zone’, thoughin the face of challenges the council had to back down.17Ethnicradio and multicultural television was established through aSpecial Broadcasting Service, and the Government subsidizedweekend ethnic schools and the teaching of communitylanguages, though these have at times appeared to be under somethreat.18Such policies reflect a multicultural, rather than anassimilationist attitude, if not forming a formal coherent policy.Funding for religious schools, e.g. by Jews or Muslims, and theoption of ‘released time’ in which religious groups can provideinstruction for their young,19are not relevant to this chapterbecause the Parsis are too small and scattered a community tobe able to take advantage of these opportunities. At the popularlevel, not least in the media, and at election time in the 1990s,there have been occasional outbursts of opposition to immigra-tion, and some repetition of White Australia themes. Australiaremains a predominantly White country, with twenty times asmany Australians looking to European rather than to Asian roots,and Australia is still not as cosmopolitan as Canada or the USA.20Only about one in twenty persons is not of European descent.21There has been occasional political questioning of the nation’sZoroastrians in Australia54814Hawkins,Critical Years, pp. 137–40.15J.

Australia has changed:instead of being overwhelmingly Protestant, the largest practisingdenomination is Catholic; about 25% of the population are ofnon-British origin, and over 15% were born overseas in non-English-speaking countries.22By the 1990s there were nearly twiceas many Asian as British immigrants settling in Australia,although Britain remains the single largest sender country.23A central debate, however, is whether a ceiling should be fixed tothe overall population size, in the order of twenty-two million,24because of the problem of such resources as water. This has beencountered by arguments related to global warming which suggestthat Australia could accept a much larger population.25Variousgovernments have seen migration as a spur to development; evenat times of unemployment, on the grounds that immigrants createmore jobs than they take.26By the turn of the millennium, Sydneyand Melbourne especially were visibly diverse societies. At themost cynical level, any government has to take account of theethnic minority vote.Australian and Canadian immigration policy comparedThere are obvious points of comparison between the two countries:both were part of the British Empire and Commonwealth,both wanted to be seen as modern, liberal, democratic nations, witha sympathy for refugees. Both selected individuals and families tomeet the perceived needs of their nation. The two have a similar,yet different, legislative framework for multicultural policy and bothsee a degree of immigration as necessary for economic growth.Both see that without immigration, they are faced with the problemof an ageing and numerically declining population. There hasbeen substantial discussion between the governments of the twocountries over the years. But whereas Australia debates a possibleceiling to population numbers, Canada has a more open-endedview. Australia, after a particularly restrictive early history, hasZoroastrians in Australia54922Jupp, ‘From “White Australia” ’, p. 212.23Ongley and Pearson, ‘Post-1945 International Migration’, p. 780.24Atchison, ‘Immigration in Two Federations’, p. 19.25Hawkins,Critical Years, p. 263.26Ibid., p. 273."},{"pageNumber":569,"pageContent":"given a high priority to immigration,27but both countrieshave had fluctuating policies depending in particular on periods ofeconomic growth and recession, though inevitably influenced byparty politics.28In both cases East and South Europeans provided‘bridges’ between the original British (and north European) policyand the later acceptance of Asian immigrants. Both Australia andCanada have evolved a points policy to target the immigrants suitedto their national needs. It is likely that Australia learned fromCanada but each was facing similar concerns, with similar problems(population shortage) and had similar goals: a balance of nationaleconomic needs and a proclaimed liberal international policy.There is little in Australia to compare with the French dimension toCanadian policy, but equally there is nothing in Canada compara-ble to the Pacific Island links. Whereas Canada lost people to itsneighbour America, Australia has drawn from its neighbour NewZealand. Australia has a longer history of ethnic differentiation, butWest Coast Canada and Australia have both had significant Eastand South East Asian migrations from the 1980s. The period of thesignificant growth in numbers of Asian migration to Australia wasapproximately twenty years later than Canada. Australia also tookapproximately 30% fewer refugees but was ready to accept morebusiness migrants.29Australia still remains a more homogeneousand British (Anglo-Celtic) nation.30The two nations interpretthe term ‘multicultural’ differently.31The Canadian model is ofa vertical mosaic, whereby the different races and cultures preservetheir historic identity and are encouraged and enabled to do so bythe State. Australia from the outset sought to integrate immigrantsand the aim is national unity, so that the Government’s programmefor multiculturalism comes under Australian studies, something foreveryone. The goal is freedom from discrimination, equal lifechances for all, full economic, political and social participation.

In Australiatwo Associations were studied, in Sydney and Melbourne, themain ones at the time of the survey.33The point behind thiscomparison of two contrasting Zoroastrian Associations (in termsof size, migration patterns, one with, one without a building) isto try to understand the Australian and not just, say, the Sydneyexperience. Because Melbourne is a more recent and smallersettlement it does not have the same range of records and so lesscan be written about that Association; nevertheless it is worthincluding in this chapter.34The response rate to the survey from these two Associations wasparticularly good, thanks to the efforts of two individuals in thetwo bodies, Noshir Irani and Jimmy Mistree. They encouragedmembers to hand over a completed questionnaire while I wasin Australia—but before I gave a lecture, to avoid conditioningthe responses. Appendix 2, Table 1 shows that the Sydney andMelbourne communities had a number of distinctive features.They were predominantly Zoroastrians from India, with nonefrom East Africa, only a few twice migrants, i.e. Zoroastrians whohave moved on from another western county. In Melbourne therewere no Zoroastrians from Karachi, but 12% of respondentsin Sydney were from that country, a sending country we have seenin other chapters to be significant. There were very few IranianZoroastrians in Australia55133In 1987 one of the Sydney Zoroastrians, Purvez Kolsawalla, undertook a ‘Social andDemographic Survey of the Sydney Association’. His main findings were that 86% ofadults were married, 61% were under the age of 50; 32% had been in Australia for lessthan five years; there was a high level of graduate study, 60.8%, with a further 19% hav-ing done postgraduate work. Later the same year he undertook an attitudinal survey, whichfocused on questions then being debated in Sydney, namely the acceptance of the offspringof intermarried spouses (forty-six of the fifty-nine replies said they should be accepted);only ten people indicated they were willing to help say funeral prayers when a priest wasnot available; and forty-eight of the fifty-three replies said they wanted the Association tomountmuktadprayers.

In Melbourne 78% of respon-dents had a first or higher degree, as 82% had in Sydney.Melbourne had a more science-based Parsi population (32%,Sydney 22%). In both cities approximately 40% were in manage-rial or executive-class employment. Sydney appeared to have ahigher proportion of members in the early stages of their careers;i.e. aged under 40 (see Table 1: 4). There were more single peoplein Sydney (29% compared with 19% in Melbourne, see Table 1: 5),and fewer extended families (Sydney 7%, Melbourne 17%, seeTable 1: 7). Sydney had a higher rate of intermarrieds (18% ofmarriages, Melbourne 8%, see Table 1: 5). Given the higher inci-dence of intermarriage, it is not surprising that there was a higheracceptance of it (Sydney 81%, Melbourne 64%, see Table 1: 22–6)and a greater willingness to allow non-Zoroastrians into prayerrooms (with or without qualifications). The picture of religiousbeliefs and practices was complex. In Sydney a higher proportionwere in touch with local Zoroastrians—an outcome of the build-ing project, presumably, as the building had just been purchasedwhen my survey was carried out (see Table 1: 14, 17, 18). This mayalso be the explanation for the higher percentage eating Indianfood regularly in that city. More Sydney Zoroastrians readZoroastrian literature than did the Melbourne respondents (seeTable 1: 15; this may be explained by the consistently high stand-ard of the Sydney newsletter). My respondents from Melbournetended to describe themselves as Orthodox more than did peopleZoroastrians in Australia55235Working through the then (1988) current address list with one of the active membersof the Association we identified twelve Iranian Zoroastrian families on the list, with a totalof forty-nine individuals, including singles and Iranians married to Parsis. Seven familieshad members who attended occasionally. With seventy-nine responses to my questionnairefrom Melbourne, that represented in excess of 50% of all adult members, active or notcompleting the Survey. In Sydney there were at that time 225 adults on the membershiplist, so with 119 responses, that again represented a response rate of over 50% ofAssociation members, active and inactive. The returns represented approximately 90%of the active membership.36A study of the membership address list for 1981 and 1988 in Melbourne shows anincrease of members from 127 to 216 in those seven years, i.e. 70%."},{"pageNumber":572,"pageContent":"in Sydney and this is reflected in their beliefs and practicesassociated with intermarriage and funerals. More people in Sydneybelieved in reincarnation, and in Melbourne more believed in res-urrection, a feature probably explained by the influence of twoSunday school teachers in Melbourne who were educated in theirreligion and held a traditional point of view.37Sydney Zoroastrianswere more inclined to state that their beliefs had changed aftermigration (see Table 1: 30–1), though the majority still said theirbeliefs had not changed significantly. As far as community relationswere concerned, in both cities one in five respondents said thatrelations between Parsis and Iranian Zoroastrians were very mixedor poor. But Sydney respondents were far more positive aboutinternal Parsi relations (in Sydney 76% thought relations weregood or excellent, compared with only 56% in Melbourne). Therewas no significant difference in the two Associations’ perceptions ofrelations with non-Zoroastrians, 74% and 73% saying that rela-tions were good or excellent. Similarly, there was no significant dif-ference over the perceptions of racial prejudice, with less thanone-third of respondents in both cities saying they had faced suchproblems (see Table 1: 32–6).In short, the Australian Zoroastrians were recently settled,well-educated, middle-class professionals, who considered that theyhad good relations with wider society. The Sydney population, theolder of the two settlements, tended to have more young people,more singles and fewer extended families. The Sydney communitysaw itself as more united than the Melbourne group does, but theMelbourne group tended to be more traditional in religious terms.Zoroastrians in SydneyThe sourcesA preliminary note is necessary.38Reconstructing the history ofany community is difficult because of the balancing of sources,Zoroastrians in Australia55337As we have seen in other chapters, a belief in reincarnation tends to be associatedwith close Indian ties. The figures for belief in reincarnation were Sidney 51%; Melbourne40%.

Another family among the early settlers was thatof Jimmy and Shirin Mistry, whose home was used for social func-tions and committee meetings.44They came as individual families,meeting occasionally in each other’s houses for dinners. Thesenames indicate the mix of people: most from India, but some fromIran, and intermarried couples. In the early 1970s numbers are esti-mated to have been only seventy-five. A loose Association was startedin 1970 named the Australian Zoroastrian Association, with a con-stitution, and it was registered under the Charitable Donations Actsof New South Wales. The committee consisted of Akhtar Ostowari(president), Firoze Irani (vice-president), Purvez Kolsawalla (sec-retary), Jehangir Mistry (treasurer), and Dr Sam Kerr and JalTaraporewalla. All remained prominent in the Association for manyyears. The ‘oral tradition’ is that there were some personality clashes,but the Bilimoria family, coming a little later and not involved inearly disputes, brought people together. In a fascinating account ofthe memories of the early arrivals, Kolsawalla relates the motivationsand difficulties of various individuals. The key attractions were, inaddition to the climate, easier immigration than the USA, Englishlanguage and education, the anticipation of better job prospects anda better lifestyle. Most people found a job and accommodationwithin a few weeks but many had strong feelings of homesickness,missing family and experiencing loneliness.

A turning point appears tohave been the visit of Khojeste Mistree in 1978, to see his brotherFarrokh, an important person in the early history of the Sydneycommunity.46Another important early arrival was Dr PeshotanKatrak, a surgeon who served as priest and who, single-handedlyin the early days, performed all the community’s ceremonies. 1978was also the year in which the collection of funds started to build‘a place of our own’.47Even in these early days, the communityconsisted of families rather than single people. The husband usu-ally came first until he could find work and a place to live, but theintention, and practice, was to bring the family as soon as possi-ble. There were no long-term plans to return to India, as therehad been in the China Seas and Zanzibar. Because of the familyorientation, the early motives behind meetings were social, butthere was also a concern to hand on the heritage to the youngergeneration, hence the early discussions for a house. A briefaccount of this early period was provided in an interview withMrs Mahabanu Ostawari, then secretary of the AustralianZoroastrian Association, with Parsianain Bombay.48She reportedat the end of 1969 that whereas there had been only seven or eightZoroastrian families in the early 1960s, there were now 200 indi-vidual Zoroastrians in New South Wales, with ‘quite an influxfrom Calcutta’. From about 1974, she said, there had been agrowing earnestness to have an Association. Thus far individualswere meeting for Jamshedi Navroz, Pateti and Christmas. Therewas an annual jashanat the start of year, but mostly they met forsocial activities, picnics, theatres, discussion and study groups.Sunday schools were held alternate weeks, with the reading ofShah Namestories by Farrokh Mistree, and prayers were taughtto the children. There had been three naujotesin three years.She concluded, ‘AZA also had the distinction of having a non-Zoroastrian Secretary a year ago, who served three terms.’Other sources indicate that the earliest arrivals were from Indiaand Iran, but that later Zoroastrians came also from Pakistan andSri Lanka.49Zoroastrians in Australia55646Parsiana, May–June 1978, p. 15.

Manyof the names of the early arrivals remain important in thecommunity’s history through the 1980s and 1990s.

Thefirst recorded discussion of a Sunday school is in a Newsletterdated1 December 1976. It says:I am sure that one of our major aims and concerns is to spread theteachings of Zoroaster among our young ones, especially those born inAustralia...we must remember that our children are no longer in thereligious environment that we enjoyed and knew.

The editor of the Newslettercommented: ‘I personally thinkwe should thank the Modys for the publicity and I hope that suchfuture items are equally in the news, because I feel recognitionof our community in Australia is long overdue.’50The columnsof the 1970s newsletters are prophetic of issues to come: theprominence of Christmas celebrations;51the acute problemsof gathering subscriptions and especially the need for moredonations to the building project;52non-Zoroastrians supportingthe community,53and problems with adverse press images.54The pattern of growthThe pattern of membership growth can be seen from a study ofthe annual numbers (Table 9.2), which indicate both the rapidgrowth and the periods of fastest growth, in the period leading upto my survey.Zoroastrians in Australia55750The magazine article appeared in the Australian Women’s Weekly, 27 Apr. 1977.51Newsletter, 8 Nov. 1979 of the Christmas Party, ‘Santa Claus will be there with hisbag of goodies and there should be lots of fun for the children’ (repeated in Nov. 1980and 1981).

The next section of this chapter will plot thestory behind those figures.A place of our ownFundraisingOne of the central concerns of the ensuing fifteen years started inthe 1970s—the planning and fundraising for ‘a place of our own’.The history of this crusade has two main dimensions: the raisingof funds and the problems with the use of the property. Becausethe Sydney group was small and middle-class (rather thanwealthy), it was inevitably difficult to raise sufficient funds to buythe land and a suitable building. Numerous appeals and fundrais-ing events were held, but young families recently settled inAustralia could not raise the sums required. It was thereforeinevitable that they should look to outside benefactors. In theNewsletterin 1977 (15 November) reference was made to the ArbabZoroastrians in Australia558TABLE9.2.Numbers in the Sydney community,1973–1985MembersFamilies1973110381974166551975166591977/8199681979/80224751980/1231861981/2257991983/42611381984/5370142"},{"pageNumber":578,"pageContent":"Rustom Guiv donation to the New York Association, a reportwhich ended with the question, ‘Our turn next?’ The first formalapproach was made in 1980; negotiations were to consumeconsiderable time and energy throughout the coming decade.Nevertheless, following the initial launch at a function attended byKhojeste Mistree and Zubin Mehta, a building fund was begun in1978. Money was raised locally by such functions as an ‘IndianFashion Extravaganza’, the raffle of an Air India ticket, foodstalls; a core group of twenty families donated a prescribed sumeach year from the inception of the scheme in 1978. TheOstowari family gave a substantial donation of A$60,000.55These internally raised funds enabled the Association to buy fiveacres of land, with a house in Annangrove. The purchase wasagreed at a general body meeting in October 1985 and contractswere exchanged in December.56An inaugural jashanwas cele-brated on 9 February 1986. The regular Sunday school classesmoved from a private home to the ‘place of our own’ the follow-ing month, and a communal barbecue was organized in May. Atthat stage all seemed well, externally. But in fact problems werejust beginning.Financial negotiationsMoney was needed to develop the property. The Zarthoshtybrothers promised a donation, without conditions. It was madeclear that money could be available from the Guiv Trusts, but thenegotiations over the conditions were protracted. The Guivtrustees insisted that they should own the property and would leaseit to the Association for a nominal sum (one dollar per year) fora long period, hundreds of years if necessary. Dr Rustom Sarfeh,who had conducted similar negotiations with Associations inCanada and the US, argued the Guiv case. AZA maintained thatit was different in that it already owned the property. Sarfeh offeredto buy the property off the Association. The details of this negoti-ation are preserved in a number of letters between the Associationand Dr Sarfeh, and in particular in a letter from the then president,Purvez Kolsawalla, to the AZA committee following somediscussions in America. In response to the AZA comment that Zoroastrians in Australia55955See the account of the Foundation Committee in the Inaugural Jashan booklet,Sunday 9 Feb. 1986.56Manashni, Oct. 1985, and Nov.–Dec. 1985."},{"pageNumber":579,"pageContent":"‘it appeared that they seemed intent on acquiring a property ratherthan making a donation’, the Trusts replied that the money couldalways be given to someone else, and reiterated Arbab RustomGuiv’s own conviction that in return for the donation the Trustsshould have at least a partial share in the property, in order to seethat the intentions of the benefactor were honoured.57The debate over ownership then turned to the balance of mem-bers on a Managing Committee of the building, a committee thatwas to be a subcommittee of the Association, charged with generaloversight of policy regarding the building but not its day-to-daycare and use. The Trusts wished to nominate the majority of sucha committee from among the AZA membership; the Associationconsidered that as they had raised most of the funds they shouldhave the majority representation. The Trust also pressed that thecommittee should include Iranian Zoroastrians. Sarfeh insistedthat before any cheque was sent:at least two Executive Board Members of the Foundation Committeeshould be elected from amongst the Iranian Zoroastrian Community.That is because the money being from Iran, the Rustom Guiv Trusteesthink it is fair that the Iranian Zoroastrians also take part in the way themoney is being spent. This requirement is attached to all donationsmade by our beloved Arbab Rustom Guiv.58Katrak responded to this point on Iranian membership:As regards the condition that at least 2 Executive Board Members of theFoundation Committee be elected amongst the Iranian ZoroastrianCommunity here which has so far been an extremely cohesive andfriendly family...Neither in our Constitution, nor in practice, have weever sought to establish a privileged position for any particulargroup...Before the Foundation Committee was re-elected at ourAnnual General Meeting we approached two Irani Zoroastrians forposition on the Committee, but neither of them could accept thenomination because of time constraints, although they have activelysupported our work in the past, and have offered to provide any assis-tance that we may require.59Zoroastrians in Australia56057Letter P.

Is it because of lack of interest or because they are sure theywill be outvoted by the Parsees who at present have the majorityof votes?’60Ironically, in the sentences immediately preceedingthis question, Sarfeh had written that in the New World theyshould not be thinking in the old sectional terms, but simply asZoroastrians. After referring to the problems of living in ‘thismelting pot of humanity’ he wrote: ‘It should be remembered thatby our free will we have chosen to reside in countries who do thesectarian philosophy, Parsees, Irani, Pakistanis etc., but thanksGod religion and the way of worshipping it is left free. Thereforewe [ being] such a small community should introduce ourselves asZoroastrians . . .’. In a letter to Katrak of 1 February 1986, Sarfehcommented that if the persons in authority in Sydney at presentwere there for eternity, the Guiv Trusts would have no problems.But after their experiences with the property in New York, wherethe trustees did not pay attention to the question of ownershipand ‘now the management has changed and we are in an awk-ward situation which might end in the court of justice. For thisreason the Trustees have decided not to repeat the same mistake.’After referring to the seven Guiv Darbe Mehrs in western coun-tries, he said that they have always insisted on nominating threeof the six board members, and he sent samples of constitutionsagreed in America. Dr Katrak responded that what the Trustswere doing was ‘insisting that the AZA who owned the land andthe building should relinquish ownership to the Guiv Trusts whowould have donated only about one quarter of the total cost ofthe project! The AZA obviously cannot accept these conditions.’61Sarfeh responded that ownership of the property should bereflected in a legal document in such a way that it representedthe rights of the benefactors in proportion to their donation. ‘TheDarbe Mehr is the greatest asset of the Association, with manydonors, and a sub committee should be established which repre-sented the interests of those donors.’ He concluded that if theseconditions are not acceptable, ‘then we suggest that you mayforget about the donation from Arbab Guiv. Probably you canraise that much money easily from your other charitable members.Zoroastrians in Australia56160Sarfeh to Katrak, 13 Nov. 1984.61Katrak to Sarfeh, 10 Mar. 1986."},{"pageNumber":581,"pageContent":"Mrs Guiv thinks that probably in time she could donate thismoney for establishment of a Shah Verahram Izad or an AtashBahram.’62In his reply Katrak accepted that AZA would retainownership of the property, and would proceed to have the legaldocuments drawn up, showing that A$90,000 of the cost was tobe borne by Arbab Rustam and Morvarid Guiv. He also acceptedthat the trusts should nominate two trustees (from AZA member-ship) and the Association would nominate three. Having agreed tothe terms, he asked for the money.63When the Deed of Releasewas actually signed on 19 November 1987, clauses 11–13stipulated that the donor (Rustom Guiv Trust) should appoint fivepersons who were members of the Association who were residentin Australia to form a subcommittee. All five (identified byname in clause 13) were Iranians. In clause 2, however, it wasstated that the monies ‘shall be used for the erection of a house ofprayer...the legal and beneficial ownership in which shall bevested in the Association, on lands owned by the Association’.As in some American Associations, Dr Sarfeh’s letters some-times caused personal offence to the recipients. For example, hewrote to Purvez Kolsawalla (a Parsi), then president; ‘I rememberyou telling me that the Parsees even refuse to pay their member-ship dues. Possibly this is in their culture, and the way of theirpractice in India. I think someone should tell them that in westerncountries every member of a Church, Synagogue, Temple etc. issupposed to pay his gathering and worshipping center, the sameway he pays for his personal living quarters.’ He then commentedon the building, and named the President: ‘I think it is a suitableplace for the Headquarters of Kolsawalla for administering hispersonal affairs. The committee should purchase the presentpremises for their beloved President.’64In the debates over ownership another issue was the naming ofthe property. From the outset the Guiv Trusts had insisted on thisbeing ‘the Arbab Rustom and Morvarid Guiv Darbe Meher’. TheAZA questioned this on the grounds that, if a larger donor wasfound, should not their name be used? The negotiations yieldedthe proposal that naming different parts of the building shouldreflect the proportion of the donation; so, for example, the DarbeZoroastrians in Australia56262Sarfeh to Katrak, 11 Apr. 1986.63Katrak to Sarfeh, 19 May 1986.64Manashni, Apr.–May 1992."},{"pageNumber":582,"pageContent":"Mehr was indeed named after the Guivs, and the library wasnamed after the second largest donors, the Zarthoshty brothers.Problems with neighboursBut funding and ownership rights were only one aspect of theproblems of ‘the place of our own’. In 1987 trouble began withthe neighbours. In October complaints were made to the policeabout members parking on the roadside, near a narrow bend andon private side roads. More complaints were made when a youthgroup played loud music into the early hours of the morning.65On another occasion, a neighbour was rude to communitymembers and the committee considered approaching the Anti-Discrimination Board, but decided not to do so.66A newspaperinterview had been published with the neighbours on theproblems they were having with the Association—who protestedstrongly at the unbalanced reporting of the issue.67The neigh-bours had the planned development stalled for one year on thegrounds of traffic noise, inadequate sewage, invasion of privacyand access roads being jammed by what the newspaper describedas ‘an obscure religious movement’. The neighbours and politi-cians were invited to meet members and to attend a function, butthey declined. The Council imposed such restrictions that use ofthe property had to stop, not only for major functions such as No Ruz, but small events, for example, the monthly Sunday schoolmeetings.68In a local paper an article was published which theAssociation found deeply offensive.69It was headed ‘Row oversect’s move to suburb’ and said:A religious row is brewing between residents and an obscure sect overplans to set up a permanent meeting and biblical instruction houseat Annangrove...One of the reasons for the residents’ objection was‘The activities and attitudes of the Zoroastrian members are not accept-able.’...A spokesman for the residents, Ron Prior, says he is ‘deadZoroastrians in Australia56365The problem was associated with a youth disco.

The Manashnieditor Kersi Meher-Homjiwrote a response which was published (25 July 1989). He beganby pointing out that they were not a sect but a well-establishedreligion and went on:We have no quarrels with our fellow residents...Being a minoritycommunity and friendly, we assimilate easily...[residents’ objectionthat activities are not acceptable] has stumped us. A recent demographicsurvey shows that 6 per cent of our members are in the medical profession,7 per cent are engineers and 8 per cent are in accountancy and finance;60.8 per cent of us are university graduates compared with the Australianaverage of under 5 per cent. Of these 60.8 per cent, 19 per cent havepostgraduate qualifications. And yet we are unacceptable to some of ourhighly erudite neighbours!He acknowledged that there was one noisy late night partyin June 1987: ‘That is one party in four years’ stay atAnnangrove!...Australia is our country because it is free andbeautiful. All we ask is a fair go. It is certainly unfair to ask us,Australian citizens, to move from the property we bought with ourhard-earned money!’The Association then had to decide whether to sell and relocate,or whether to stay and contest the Council decision in the AppealCourt, which had effectively closed the property. At the AGMeeting on 20 September the situation was summed up:The idealists said ‘Injustice has been done to us by the Council. We havedone nothing wrong; why should we leave our property and relocate?’The realists agreed on the injustice theme but warned that ‘even if we winthe appeal (chances 60%; cost $10–15,000) we won’t be happy as theneighbours will continue to bicker. So we should be sensible and relocate.’A decision was postponed for three months in which time detailedfigures, alternative properties, and individuals’ views were to becollected.

The vote to appeal to the Landand Environment Court was then carried by 170 votes to 40.70At a further general meeting ten months later the question wasrevisited in the light of the engineer’s and other reports; costs werehigh, and an alternative property had been identified, but again,the will of the meeting was to stay and fight.71The appeal startedon 21 September 1990 and lasted five days (not the threeexpected). A single adjudicator heard the case. The neighbours’barrister produced eight witnesses, the chief town architect andthe chief engineer plus six neighbours. The AZA’s barrister pro-duced four witnesses, three consultants (a town planner, a trafficengineer and a sewage engineer) and the current AZA president,Noshir Irani, who was cross-examined for one and a half daysin the witness box. The court visited the site and the homes of theneighbours. Judgement was given in favour of the AZA and allthe conditions imposed (e.g. parking and sewage arrangements)were those the AZA had proposed. The Manashnireport thenemphasized that it was important to take care with parking and toestablish good relations with neighbours.72Another hurdleBut still the problems were not over. The extra costs of theextended court case, and the costs of the building work, weresignificantly more than the Association had in its reserves. A letterwas therefore sent to Mr Zarthoshty to ask whether his donation,which had been given without conditions, could be used to meetthese bills.

Some Association members, especially those recently set-tled in Sydney, were questioning the value of owning a property.Open letters circulated (which were not published in Manashnibecause some of the allegations bordered on the libellous),questioning whether the zoning, restrictions on the frequency(three social events including Christmas) and time of day forfunctions (all must finish by 8.00 p.m.), and the fixed number ofparking spaces (seventy), meant that the costly project was a whiteelephant. It was further alleged that as no Zoroastrian architecthad been employed, the building did not have a Zoroastrianappearance. Finally, and controversially, the letters accusedthe committee of not publishing the full judgement in order thattheir triumph might look greater.75The Manashnieditor, KersiMeher-Homji, however, took a strongly optimistic approach, say-ing that a centre was needed to give a sense of identity; it wouldbe a place to hold functions, and Hinnells’s statistics showed theimportance of a centre in preserving the tradition.

The tide, he asserted, was turning, thetime was come to raise the remaining funds needed and to proceedwith a new building which would meet the Council’s requirementsand for which overseas donations could properly be used.But even in the same Newsletter, another of the long-standingworkers, Tim Desai, voiced thoughts that the new building wouldcost something like $250,000 yet it could only be approximately10% larger. He thought it best to introduce the Council’s require-ments by members doing much of the work themselves to savemoney. But by November of that year it was agreed to proceedwith consulting the Council on plans for a new building. The planstook twelve months to finalize. Their agreement was announcedto the worldwide community through the columns ofParsianainJuly 1993 (p. 14). Despite the ever-present problem of raising yetmore funds, the September 1994 issue ofParsianawas able toannounce, through a two-page spread, that the new ArbabRustom and Morvarid Guiv Darbe Mehr, after six months ofbuilding work, had been inaugurated with a jashanon 12 July1994.

The 200 families (plus fifty to eightysingles) were now able to use their property for Sunday schools,prayer meetings and social functions, though these had to be heldduring the day and only a certain number could take place in anyone year. Plans were already being discussed for the use of someof the three acres of bush land that formed part of the property.76Further disputesA different, and perhaps more internally divisive, series ofarguments erupted over the fittings of the property. The first wasregarding plaques recording donations; the second over two paint-ings of the Prophet, one depicting him according to western con-ventions; and a third concerned a proposed memorial rosegarden.

The question over theplaques was whether they should be placed according to the sizeof donation, or alphabetically. A related issue was the spread ofthe plaques towards the kebla. It would be a mistake to think thatthe sequence of the plaques was simply a question of vanity. Mostof the plaques recorded donations in memory of a departed lovedone. There was also a feeling that these plaques prioritized the giv-ing of money and neglected the contributions of people’s timeand labour.77The feelings became so intense that three past pres-idents tabled an undated letter at the AGM saying how perturbedand unhappy they were at recent events and calling for an end tothe acrimony which they said was not uncommon elsewhere, buthad not been typical of Sydney. The debate over the paintings wassettled by a community vote on whether the different portraitsshould be hung in the building; a substantial majority agreed thatthey should be.78Further issues arose concerning the use of the building and apossible extension. Some people felt that there should be separateteaching and meeting rooms. The Sunday school had to be heldin the hall, the echoes in which meant that children could not hearwhat the teacher said because of the jollity of the parents in thebackground. In the view of some, not least the teachers, this gavethe children the impression that the classes were not serious.

How did that affect their ties to the old country?The links to India are evident and are shown, for example, by theircommitment to teach Gujarati at Sunday school. Government fundsfor ethnic languages aided the long-lasting commitment of teachersand parents,82though the former sometimes registered their con-cern at the small numbers attending.83The teachers also told theparents that more language work should be done at home, becauseone hour per month was not sufficient for the children to learnmuch Gujarati.84On a number of occasions, Gujarati nataksweremounted;85onenatakwas so successful that it was staged on two sub-sequent occasions for other Indian communities.86In 1991 a NoRuz function included a Parsi Gujarati comedy (and Indiandance),87and in 1997 two Parsi natakswere mounted publicly andwere well attended by non-Parsi Gujaratis.88In personal conversa-tion, a number of people stated that their young sometimes con-versed with their elders in Gujarati, and that on visiting the oldcountry they had displayed more knowledge of the language thantheir parents realized that they had, though their understanding wassaid to be better than their spoken Gujarati.

The negative impact not only onoutsiders, but also on the young within the community, can domore harm than is readily apparent.In order to counter such negative public images the communityattaches particular importance to people and events that presenta positive image of the community. For example, the publicityassociated with the first naujotein Australia, referred to above, pro-vided an opportunity for publicly presenting Zoroastrianism as‘the first monotheistic religion’, explaining the belief that ‘Godis light’, that the priest is a surgeon, and that Zoroastrianisminvolves dedicating one’s life to ‘good thoughts, good words andgood deeds’.

Early on it was thought that emphasizing the religiousnature of the Association might help tax-exempt status, but it was feltthen that the community as a whole did not want a religiousflavour.115It was decided after discussion that the president did nothave to be a practising Zoroastrian.116Similarly, the ManagingCommittee minutes for 2 October 1992 record the concern, ‘to keepreligion out of Managing Committee. It was explained that thisrelated to the beliefs and not to the religion per se.’ This clearlyexpresses a non-doctrinal priority in what was seen as the heart ofthe religion. The motive was to try to reduce disputes. Yet there hasbeen continued emphasis on the importance of the Sunday schoolsince 1976. There are, of course, religious and non-religious peoplein the Association. The extent to which religion is a part of, orseparate from, culture is a major issue for both Zoroastrians andexternal academic discourse. In the West, especially in a Protestantcontext, religion is an individual matter of faith. That is the case forsome Zoroastrians, but for many it is rather a question of identitywithin the community. Where religion is understood in a ‘Protestant’way, then conversion, or acceptance, is more acceptable than it iswhere religion is identified with communal identity.The debate over the ‘religious’ dimension of Zoroastrianismand the boundaries of (un)acceptable assimilation is manifest invarious ways and can be illustrated by an incident in 1999.

He asked whether aChristmas party would be staged in a Hindu, Buddhist, Sikh orMuslim centre of worship. Although the Darbe Mehr ‘is notofficially consecrated, it is already sanctified by the performance ofmany JASHANS, recitations ofHUMBANDAGISand performance ofFUNERAL PRAYERS’ (capitals in original). The contrasting culturalbackgrounds were highlighted when in 1999 the Association intro-duced the Iranian Deygan festival to balance Christmas. In thissomeone played the role of Baba Firuz, a traditional Iranian fig-ure, and danced around the room handing out sweets and pres-ents as in Iran,117but this is reported to have seemed alien to anumber of Parsi children. In the same issue ofManashnithatreported the Deygan festival, an explanation of the Christmas treewas given which linked Mithras’ birthday with 25 December,when it is said evergreen tress were decorated. The article con-cluded: ‘Today we should be proud that modern Xmas practicesare rituals that come from our very own culture and customs.They have been both adopted and adapted to suit different peopleand different times. The proud origins of ancient Persia should benarrated to our children.’Zoroastrians in Australia578117Manashni, Jan. 2000 (not paginated)."},{"pageNumber":598,"pageContent":"Another good example of an issue which highlights questionsof tradition and assimilation was the proposal to establish a rosegarden in memory of ‘the dear departed’, which one family waswilling to fund. This was to have been a small, oval garden with acentral elevated rose bed, the whole area being screened byconifers. It was proposed that there should be memorial plaques,but no scattering or burial of ashes. In a general discussion of theproposal, various doubts were expressed. It was thought that itwould be a unique development, that it would provoke images ofa burial ground, that such a garden should not be located near anagiary or Atash Bahram; it was said to be against the spirit of thereligion because it meant permanent grieving and it would bebetter to have a sports complex, library or scholarships thana remembrance in stone. Such a development, it was said, wouldseem like Christianity. The proposal was voted down by a ratio of3:1.118The boundaries of assimilation and the preservationof culture can be difficult to determine.119Comparing the notice-boards of early issues ofManashni, and those at the end of the1990s, especially after the opening of the Darbe Mehr, and theinteraction between Parsis and Iranian Zoroastrians, one sees thatthere is more emphasis on religious activities in the later years,although it has been agreed that the president does not have tobe religious. Interestingly, in a small discussion group in 2000, ayoung visitor from Toronto commented on how much less religionthere appeared to be in the Sydney community compared withthat in Toronto.As was noted above, Sunday schools were seen as importantfrom early days, but these have not been easy to manage. Oneproblem has been to ensure the proper training of teachers andthe provision of resources. There have sometimes been com-plaints that the children were bored, but at others there has beenevident fondness for the teachers, and some Sunday school friend-ships have lasted for years; to later arrivals the group can thenlook like a clique. The problems in attracting the youth have beenconsiderable. Many of them spend most of their time with non-Zoroastrians, and many of these non-Zoroastrians are notreligious, which has an impact on the young Zoroastrians’Zoroastrians in Australia579118Minutes of the AGM, Aug. 1999.119For the debate see Manashni, May–June 1999, p. 10, for the renaming of thefunction,Manashni, Oct.–Nov. 1999."},{"pageNumber":599,"pageContent":"perception of religion. An internal survey found that relatively fewof the children of regular-attending parents themselves cameregularly. Some youths commented in 2000 that although theywere proud of their identity, they were embarrassed and alienatedby the quarrelling and gossiping among the elders, which they saidsometimes appeared to them to border on fanaticism, and theexample of the Christmas tree dispute was cited. Further, it wassaid that parents did not understand or empathize with youngpeople who had not been brought up in India. Some of theyoungsters said that, although they enjoyed going to India, theydid not feel at home there and that the dominance of religionthere made them feel inadequate. They wanted more informationand debate on the religion. They also complained that functionsand rituals were too long. The age-old, and almost universal,generation gap can be exacerbated when the two generations arebrought up in different cultures, and each has different needs to befulfilled by communal events.Making provision for the religious needs of a young diasporacommunity is not easy. There have, for example, been difficulties infinding someone able to say the funeral prayers at the crematorium.Three volunteers were eventually found, and the question wasraised whether women could say the prayers—there being notradition of women’s community (as opposed to domestic) ritual,mainly because of the purity laws.120There have been discussionsconcerning the recruitment of a priest from India, but the costs,and liturgical provisions (especially before the Darbe Mehr wasbuilt) made it impossible.121There have been two people committedto encouraging the study of religion among the adults. Oneis Dr Sam Kerr, who started a column on religion in ManashniinJuly 1986, and has maintained it for many years. The other isDr Purvez Kolsawalla, who first started collecting demographicdata on the community, and then obtained videos on the religion forsale. He has also conducted discussion groups for parents, on thetheme of being a Zoroastrian in Australia, while the children werein the Sunday school. To stimulate an interest in their owncommunity’s history he produced the CD of records used above. Inorder to educate himself he took a doctorate at the ZoroastrianZoroastrians in Australia580120Managing Committee file, 5 May and 13 Aug. 1983.121Managing Committee file, 9 May 1985 and 14 Feb. 1988."},{"pageNumber":600,"pageContent":"College in Sanjan run by Dr Mrs Master-Moos (see Chapter 2 onBombay).

In the 1990s, however, there hasbeen an intensive seminar by Khojeste Mistree,125and lecturesalso from Prof. Farhang Mehr,126Professor Kaikhusroo Irani127andDr Ali Jafarey (the last three, it might be noted, all from the USA,not from India).128The only visit of a High Priest occurred whenDastur Dr Kaikhusroo M.

Lay people who, though educated,had not been schooled in the religion, attempted to teach the community.

The only record of a visit froma leading Iranian that I have been able to trace was of theZoroastrian representative in the Majlis, Parviz Ravani, but thatwas not a religious visit.130Being AustralianWe’re fortunate to be living in a country like Australia where thecommunity is prosperous and able to sustain a fairly decent standard ofliving. We have the added advantage of living in a country where lawand order prevails, there is freedom to practise religion and human life issecure.131Not only in the printed columns of newsletters, but also in privateconversation, Sydney Zoroastrians have expressed a strong senseof being Australian, of the beauty and freedom of Australia, andof a pride in the country especially at sporting events when thenational anthem is played. In keeping with tradition, and as anexpression of commitment to the new country, in October 1996the Managing Committee resolved to make annual donations toAustralian charities. The two main reasons for choosing Australiaas a destination for migration were the climate, which is moretemperate than most of Canada, and the employment prospects.However in private, some well-established Sydney Zoroastrianssaid that they had not been able to rise to the levels of seniority thatthey would have achieved in India. A number of people haddeclined to identify their job in the Association’s Directory becausethey had been compelled to take work which, in the Parsi valuesystem, did not have high status. It would therefore be simplistic tosuggest that life in Australia was all that everyone had hoped for.The social lifeThe social life of the community is important for all Zoroastrians,whether they are religious or ‘secular’.

Therange of functions has increased over the years to include youthactivities (some, but not all, linked to the Sunday school): Fridayevening functions (bring your own food and wine), tennis andtable-tennis tournaments,132lecture programmes, as well as nataksand other activities already discussed. In a six-month programmeof events at the Darbe Mehr in 1999, there were twenty-threeevents in the first half of the year, including the festivals. It isdifficult to say whether these functions, which can attract severalhundred Zoroastrians, are religious or secular. Fundamentally, itdoes not matter, anymore than whether Christmas is a strictlyreligious or a family function in many British homes. They aretimes of coming together as a community, a time to enjoy food,the language of the old country, to preserve identity througha network of friends, and a place to be one’s self. Since the open-ing of the Darbe Mehr, inevitably the level of activity hasincreased. Of course with the passage of time, as earlier settlersgrow old, and as families move over from India, senior citizens’functions have grown. One problem, inevitably, is that functionsthat appeal to one group, be that the elders of the community orthe Parsis, do not appeal to others, for example the youth or theIranian Zoroastrians.An activity which has become even more prominent in Sydneythan perhaps in any other Parsi community is cricket. This is notonly because of Kersey Meher-Homji’s books and his work asa regular newspaper cricket columnist.133There has also beenan enthusiastic young team which plays regularly in the InterCultural Cricket Tournament, and which has sometimes beenvery successful both in league and cup competitions, triumphsenthusiastically described in the columns ofManashni.134Indeed,in April 1990 a separate document was produced on the 1989–90triumphant season in which they won the league and were grandfinalists in the knock-out competition, where they were beaten bya team of Sri Lankans.

It is obviously a questionof pride for the Association, a positive image to present in thepress. It is also the case that, as we have seen in earlier chapters,cricket has been a lasting part of the imperial heritage on thesubcontinent in general, and among the Parsis in particular.137The AZA, therefore, succeeded where Parsis have troddenbefore, in the old country, though towards the end of the 1990sthe level of sporting activity in general, and cricket in particular,declined.Sydney Zoroastrians at the turn of the millenniumIn 1999, the Sydney Zoroastrians produced an updated Directoryof members. It listed 254 ‘households, with a total of 850 peoplein those households’. Discussing this list with two of the estab-lished members, or elders, of the Association, made it possible toput together the following profile. The list details thirty-nineIranian households, twenty with people from Pakistan, six fromCalcutta, two from East Africa and one from Canada. The rest ofthe Zoroastrian population is from Bombay. One hundred andfifty-nine households had people who had been there for overtwelve years, eighty of them for twenty years or more. Thirty-fivehouseholds consisted of an intermarried couple. The two eldersidentified sixty-six households as having members who attendedthe centre regularly. The elders were asked to classify the occupa-tion of the individuals where this was known. The majority wereidentified as administrators, with people in the professions, busi-ness, accountancy and medicine coming close ‘joint seconds’.Only one person was identified as a manual worker. This growingcommunity has therefore retained the middle-class status identi-fied in my survey, and still has roughly the same proportion ofpeople from the various ‘sending’ countries.Zoroastrians in Australia584135The following season was also successful, with the team again reaching thesemi-final:Manashni, Jan./Feb. 1991, p. 10, Mar.–June 1991, p. 15.136Manashni, Nov.–Dec. 1989, p. 9.137See Hinnells,Zoroastrians in Britain, 1996, pp. 85–7 and in Chs. 4 and 6 in this bookon Hong Kong and East Africa."},{"pageNumber":604,"pageContent":"In December 2000, a ‘Secret Women’s Business Report’ wasprepared by Dinaz Mistry, vice-president of AZA. The title didnot indicate secretiveness but alluded to an interest-catching courtcase, fought by women of the Ngarrindjeri Aboriginal tribe topreserve their sacred rites. In the Zoroastrian activity, twelvewomen had a series of meetings to produce policy proposals. Themain problems that they identified were: the lack of an infra-structure to support people in need, drugs, loneliness, unemploy-ment, a sense of apathy, adult inflexibility and insensitivitytowards their youth, and difficulties between the old and newsettlers. They stated that there was a tendency for cliques todevelop according to place of origin, not only Iranians and Parsis,but also settlers from Bombay, Karachi and Calcutta. They alsoreported people’s concerns about the difficulties in getting to theAZA house. They made a series of recommendations, includingone that the men should now form a think tank.Zoroastrians in MelbourneFrom an Australian perspective, Sydney and Melbourne aregeographically close, less than a thousand miles apart. The twocities are traditional rivals. The two Zoroastrian communitieshave good relations, but they are very different.The founding yearsThe Melbourne group’s origins lie in informal dinner parties inthe homes of different Parsi families living in Melbourne in 1974,notably the Batliwallas, Iranis, Dastors, Jungalwallas and threeRustomjees—Framroze, who died in 1978 but had been a leadingspirit; Noshir, who framed the constitution and Pilloo, whobecame the first president. It was formally established in 1978. In1980 they organized their first Pateti (with 115 attendees) and NoRuz (124 attendees). The early social activities included boat andfilm trips, a cricket match and a camping trip. But ‘the need formore traditional religious celebrations was felt by many.’ Somemembers suggested that ‘ZAV [The Zoroastrian Associationof Victoria] functions should place less emphasis on food andencourage differing activities blending our traditions with theZoroastrians in Australia585"},{"pageNumber":605,"pageContent":"Australian way of life.’138Religious education classes were startedin the early 1980s, but were closed down in 1987 owing to lack ofsupport.139In the same year, however, a newsletter,Rathaeshtar, wasstarted,140and the Association was formally incorporated.141A questionnaire was circulated around the community, also in1987, consulting the people on what the members thought its pri-orities should be. It had an impressive 73% response rate. Therewas a 100% agreement that there should be an Association, and asubstantial majority (83% v. 17%) thought that the Associationshould mean ‘more than just occasional “get-togethers”, wherefood and entertainment are the focal interests’. But what thatsomething more was, was not clear. Thirty-two percent thought itshould be social, 31% voted for cultural and mutual help, 10%voted for financial concerns, and religion was supported by only6%. Yet, as the organizers commented, answers to other questionssuggested more of a concern for religion. So, for example, 80%said that the Association should have an initiated ‘dastur’ there;72% wanted religious instruction for children; 77% thought theAssociation had a part in providing ‘an ethnic religious identity’for members; 86% thought they should keep their identity whilstassimilating. To this end, 69% wanted the adults to meet occa-sionally for ‘prayer meetings and/or religious discussions’. Thekind of get-togethers receiving the most votes were picnics, dinnerdances and going to restaurants or plays. The implication ofthis appears to be that while there was a general concern topreserve culture/religion, there was no clear idea of any specifi-cally religious activity. Only one person suggested an annual com-munity jashan. When the constitution was agreed in 1987 it isnoteworthy that under the seven subcommittees listed, rangingfrom migration to entertainment, there was none on religion.142It might, therefore, be concluded that at this stage of theAssociation’s history the body was of a secular nature, thoughZoroastrians in Australia586138Managing Committee minutes for 5 Mar. and 24 Sept. 1982 respectively.

The first was thedevelopment of a constitution, which required members to iden-tify what their priorities and goals were. The second issue waswhether to raise the funds to buy ‘a place of our own’ (APOO).The ConstitutionThe Melbourne constitution and the associated ‘Statement ofPurposes’ are particularly interesting. In brief, the ten purposesspecified in the constitution are:(a) To preserve traditional and cultural identity of Zoroastriansin the multi-cultural society of Australia.(b) To make a cultural contribution to Australian society.(c) To preserve and advance the tenets of the Zoroastrian reli-gion among members of the Association and Zoroastrianmigrants to Australia.(d) To aid the integration of Zoroastrian migrants into theAustralian community.(e) To develop co-operation, friendly relations and mutual under-standing between the people of Australia and Zoroastrianmigrants...(f) To afford relief to Zoroastrian migrants in distress...(g) To maintain and preserve cordial and fraternal relations withall Zoroastrian Associations in the world.(h) To contribute to the promotion and advancement of theinterests and welfare of the Commonwealth of Australia.(i) To assist, by donations or otherwise, charities in Australia andoverseas.(j) To promote and maintain cordial relations with Associationsor bodies of other Religions and Cultures.What is noteworthy is the emphasis in these stated purposes onrelations with Australian society (in (a), (b), (d), (e), (h), (i) and byZoroastrians in Australia587143The circular giving the answers to the questionnaires sent to forty-six families wascirculated on 27 Apr. 1987, together with two appendices of written comments fromrespondents, and responses from the committee."},{"pageNumber":607,"pageContent":"implication (j)). This is far more, for example, than in the 1862constitution in London or even in modern American constitutions.The agreed constitution reproduced much of this. Only (c), (f), (g)are purposes specific to the internal affairs of the Zoroastriancommunity. The emphasis on contributing to Australian multi-cultural society is without parallel in any community studied. Itis also striking that in the constitution (p. 4) the Associationalso said that one of its concerns was ‘To . . . aid Australia inthe prosecution of any war in which the Commonwealth isengaged.’ The Australian identity, and a sense of not simplybeing Indian, is clearly indicated by a discussion at the AGM in1988. The Indian community of Victoria was reported to beorganizing a Federation of the Indian Communal Organisationsin order ‘to make unified approach to the problems facing themigrants from India such as, acceptance of Indian qualifications,discrimination in migration policy etc.’ The reasons the ZAV gavefor not joining are significant for their self-understanding, and areworth quoting.1. The ZAV is basically a cultural organization intended topreserve the identity of Zoroastrians and advance the tenetsof the Zoroastrian religion among the members of theAssociation and the Zoroastrian migrants in Australia.2. The members of our Association come not only from India,but from other parts of the world also like Iran, Pakistan,Sri Lanka and some even from Africa.3. Most of the members now being Australian citizens do notwish to belong to any politically motivated lobbying or pressuregroup.The ‘Australianess’ of the Melbourne group is important. It issignificant that the next newsletter recorded an agreement to workfor closer links with the Zoroastrians in Sydney, but not with theMelbourne India Association.144This changed during the 1990sunder different leaders. The willingness to join an AustralianZoroastrian Association continued, but at the 1997–8 AGM itwas agreed to join the Indian Communal Federation, and thegroup did so the following year. This involved serious debates overwhat it meant to be a multicultural body, and the unhappiness ofZoroastrians in Australia588144Rathaeshtar, 25 July 1988."},{"pageNumber":608,"pageContent":"certain Iranian Zoroastrians at the visible India link led to theirdeparture from the Association. Earlier the Association hadresponded to the Indian High Commissioner’s request for detailsof Indian Associations, and the Parsis mounted a display and stallas part of the Australian Indian Society’s contribution to theInternational Folk Fest in 1994.145The definition of ‘Zoroastrian’ in the Constitution is alsointeresting. It reads (2.7):‘Zoroastrian’ means a person who has been admitted to the Zoroastrianfaith by the performance of a Navjote Ceremony and has not thereafterrenounced the same and/or declared his allegiance to any other religion.There is no reference to ancestry. The definition was the subjectof a lively discussion at an extraordinary general meeting to dis-cuss the Incorporation of the Association. One of the ManagingCommittee, Mr David Izaac,pointed out that a true Zoroastrian is not necessarily a person who has[had] performed a NaujoteCeremony. He can also be a person whoprofesses the faith. A big argument arose and many decided to leave thereligious aspect out. But Dr Piloo Rustomjee rightly pointed out thatthe word Zoroastrian is just an interpretation of a word and if it iscompletely removed we will see the demise of the Association.Therefore the matter about the meaning of the world ‘Zoroastrian’ wasmoved back for discussion.146The question of Zoroastrian identity will recur outside thisdiscussion of the constitution.A place of our own (APOO)The debates over obtaining ‘a place of our own’ have been long.Major problems in Melbourne were that community numberswere so much smaller than in Sydney, the potential for raisingfunds internally was much less, and the Sydney problems in nego-tiating with the Guiv Trusts made leaders in Melbourne hesitantto follow that path.

One long-standing concern of the ManagingCommittee was that people voted for fundraising, but did notsupport it by attending meetings or subscribing to events.151Undoubtedly a major problem was that most members in sucha young community have themselves only recently migrated, andare still in the early stages of their careers and home-building ona new continent.

As in Sydney, thereis a question of what that identity is. The initial impression of thenewsletter,Rathaeshtar, is that the identity is specifically Parsi. Thusthe jokes and cartoons in several early issues are all in Gujarati,152or the characters are clearly indicated as Parsis by their dress,153and the recipes tended to be for Indian/Parsi dishes.154Melbourne was, as noted above, involved like Sydney, in mount-ing the traditional Gujarati plays,nataks.155Until September 1995the overseas news was virtually all from India, with nothing fromIran.156The newsletter also carried announcements of Diwalifunctions or Indian Independence Day celebrations in the earlyyears, despite the reluctance noted above to joining the IndianAssociation.157A trend developed, however, from the early 1990s, towardsinvolving Iranians. First, there was an appeal from the thenpresident, Arnavaz Chubb, written in both Farsi and English, toIranian Zoroastrians to participate. She wrote:Of late, many Zoroastrians from Iran have not been taking an activepart in the functions of the Z.A.V.C. Please note that the Z.A.V.C. is forall Zoroastrians from all parts of the world (universe).We are a small community in Melbourne and it is important thatwe should remain together for the greater benefit of each other.

Later that year there wasan explanation of the Iranian tradition of the sofreh haftseen, thehighly symbolic table setting for No Ruz.161The September 1996issue was notable for a four-page article on the Sixth WorldZoroastrian Congress in Tehran and the first instalment of anextensive report on a tour of Zoroastrian Iran.The item on the Tehran conference is worth discussing becausethe Melbourne newsletter gave the Tehran Congress greatercoverage than did any other local Zoroastrian newsletter. Itincluded quotations from two speeches, in particular, the words ofthe Hon’ble Vice President of Iran, Ayatollah Mohajerani, whohad declared to Zoroastrians assembled from around the world,‘This land is your own land.’ The other speech quoted was byAyatollah Syed Ali Khomenei, who said: ‘It is Iran’s good fortunethat our country was the birthplace of Zarathustra...not everycountry is so fortunate as to have had a prophet born on its soil.Zoroastrianism came several centuries before Islam and theIslamic Republic of Iran today officially recognises the divinereligion of Zarathustra.’162The allocation of five pages of thenewsletter to Iran stands in contrast to previous coverage, and the quoted passages emphasizing that Iran is the Zoroastrians’ ownland might have been seen as redressing the national balance.However, in the same issue was a full-page advertisementfor ‘A Traditional Zoroastrian Nite’ which had the captions forall three cartoons exclusively in Gujarati and figures who were allZoroastrians in Australia592158Rathaeshtar, Nov. 1991, pp. 4 f.159Rathaeshtar, Mar. 1992, p. 3.160Rathaeshtar, Feb. 1996.161Rathaeshtar, June 1996.162Rathaeshtar, Sept. 1996, pp. 17–20."},{"pageNumber":612,"pageContent":"obviously Parsi (p. 10).

The cartoon showed a Parsi couple alongsidethehaftseentable, and advertised both Iranian and Parsi dishes.163What was evidently happening in the early 1990s was a naturalprocess whereby people in the early years of their migration weretied strongly to their ethnic culture. The brother/sisterhood ofIranians and Parsis referred to by the president only has realitywhere this is seen in terms of Zoroastrianism. In terms of secularethnicity, food, music, dress, there is no bond. It is in matters con-cerning the ancient religion that the family ties are clear. Partly inresponse to pressure from the minority group of IranianZoroastrians, and partly, perhaps, as a marker of a growing senseof religious identity, the Parsi–Iranian features were set within aZoroastrian context. Yet the ‘ethnic’ divide continued. The link tothe Indian Association caused problems for a number of IranianZoroastrians who joined Iranian Associations in Victoria, and thenewsletters continued to contain, predominantly, news from Parsisin India. In Rathaeshtar, May 2000, there was a notice concerningthe death of the senior Iranian Zoroastrian priest, the Mobed-eMobedan, Rostam Shahzadi. But the item was preceded by a pageand a half of Zoroastrian achievers who were all Parsi, and was fol-lowed by a long passage from the Orthodox Bombay Parsi news-paperDeen Parast, a paper with religious views that few IranianZoroastrians would accept. Despite the various efforts to balancerepresentation, therefore, the Melbourne newsletter, and the activ-ities it reflects, continued to depict a Parsi rather than a broadZoroastrian perspective. In this sense it reflected an ethnic morethan a religious emphasis, in so far as such a distinction is valid inthis context. Traditions that mattered to one group seemed strangeto the others, and the records include instances of ridicule.164Thetwo groups may share a common religion, but the perception ofZoroastrians in Australia593163See also the May 1997 Rathaeshtar, which had two news item pertaining to IranianZoroastrians, the eleventh anniversary of the Canadian based Iranian Zoroastrian maga-zine,Payk-e-Mehr, and UNESCO’S designation of Yazd as the second most historicallysignificant city in the world after Venice.

The constitution didnot refer to ancestry in the definition; this was partly, it wouldappear, in response to the views of one person with noZoroastrian parentage, but who had served on the ManagingCommittee. The matter has, however, come to a head on morethan one occasion. For example, in a Managing Committee meet-ing in 1987 the then Sunday school teacher said that she wouldteach prayers only to: ‘children who are pure Parsi—in otherwords children born of both Parsi parents. This has caused a lotof concern within our community and therefore Sunday Schoolwill not be operating temporarily’.165The word ‘Parsi’ here couldbe glossed ‘of Zoroastrian parents’, for in other contexts theteacher had worked with the Iranian Zoroastrians. The Sundayschool continued to be somewhat sporadic in the late 1980s andearly 1990s,166but there were also discussion groups.Rathaeshtarhas also included some religious items: an article from the SydneyZoroastrian Dr Sam Kerr,167some short poetic sermons written bya member, Shahryar Noushi,168and a message from the BombayHigh Priest, Dastur Dr K. M. JamaspAsa.169There have also beena number of short articles by another of the Association’s ownmembers, Arnavaz Chubb, who had previously undertaken post-graduate studies on Zoroastrianism with Dastur JamaspAsa inBombay.170In the last years of the millennium there were threereligious speakers: Dr Oric Basirov (A SOAS archaeologist), whospoke on the ancient history of the religion;171Cyrus Cooper, aParsi from London and follower of Pundol,172and KhojesteMistree.

For some members, notably recent settlers, bethey Iranians or Parsis ethnic factors such as language, food anddress, are commonly pre-eminent. Some members of theAssociation are deeply religious in private as in public, and forthem religion is crucial to their identity and they naturally want itto play a larger part in Association affairs. One such person wrote:‘it is very desirable that we keep in touch with religious mattersby whatever means we have at present. Please remember thatthe Parsees/Zarthostis exist with their religious identity only.The title of our Association itself has a tag of religion viz.,Zoroastrian/Zarathushtrian.’173For some of the individuals whohold such views strongly, the multicultural dimension of the workcan be taken too far. Others are atheists, yet still feel tied to the‘kith and kin’ of their community. Many non-religious individualshave as strong a sense of their history and culture as their religiousfriends do, but their identity is not expressed through specificallyreligious functions. The distinction between a religious andcultural association has been articulated more than once; so forexample one member in a private letter over a dispute wrote toanother: ‘This is not a religious association...but a culturalassociation which openly accepts members who were not bornZoroastrians. It is, therefore, not only appropriate but also obliga-tory for those members to be welcomed and not reviled.’174In factthe Managing Committee had previously (11 September 1993)discussed a change in the constitution to split ZAV into two sepa-rate bodies: 1. The Anjuman where being a Zoroastrian would bemandatory; 2. the ZAV—a social club open to all. The debate waspostponed to a later EGM, but the change has not been imple-mented, not least because the community is very small to supporttwo bodies. For some the land of their birth is ‘home’, for othersAustralia is ‘their’ country. As in Sydney, many Melbourne Parsisspeak and write with enthusiasm of Australia and its merits. Forexample, Shirin Mistry, writing to an American Zoroastrian abouther experiences as a volunteer at the 2000 Sydney Olympics, said‘everything was unbelievably fantastic. The Aussies lived up toZoroastrians in Australia595173Rathaeshtar, Jan. 1998.174Private correspondence from Sep. 1999 shown, and explained, to me in the courseof my research."},{"pageNumber":615,"pageContent":"their fun-loving kindest best and I was indeed very proud to havebeen able to do my patriotic bit in a cause we love passionately!’175More than one of these identities can feature in the self-understanding of a single individual; for example, the mostreligious individual may also be tied to the ethnicity of the‘old country’, or to Australian identity. Because individuals canhave multiple identities, so too must an Association, and yetthe preservation of identity was seen by all as the reason for thefounding of the Association.Social lifeWhatever the significance attached to religious meetings andliterature might be, the social activities remained prominent,whether these were weekend trips to Sydney,176Chinese and casinolunches,177theatre trips, barbecues,178or bingo.179The MelbourneAssociation, like others around the world, has benefited from a visit by Zubin Mehta.180But even here there can be problems. Asin so many Associations, the challenge was to engage the youthwho were bored at the functions designed for the elders.181Therewas a serious note of concern on this in the second issue ofRathaeshtar:A community is like a family unit. Just as the parents desire the wellbeing of their children; the community has to nurture its youth to bringabout a healthy, flourishing society. We are a very small community ina new country in a diverse environment. We have, therefore, a specialresponsibility towards our posterity. A Community’s well-being dependson future generations. Unfortunately, we seem to falter in this respect.We seldom meet our youngsters.The explanation given for not meeting with the youth was thatthere were time problems arising from studies and early careerpressures. So it was proposed that they should organize a ‘meet theyouth programme’.182The youth were invited to choose the dates,Zoroastrians in Australia596175Shirin Mistry to Firdosh Mehta, 7 Oct. 2000.176See also Rathaeshtar, Oct. 1995, a camp near the beauty spot of Apollo Bay.177Rathaeshtar, Sept. 1996, p. 9; also Dec. 1996—reported in spring 1997 in the president’scolumn, which records that there was a busload of Zoroastrians who enjoyed the visit.178Managing Committee files, 20 Apr. 1989.179Rathaeshtar, Nov. 1991, p. 2.180See Managing Committee files, 20 Apr. 1989.181Managing Committee minutes, 1 Mar. 1987, no. 3.182Rathaeshtar, 21 Sept. 1987."},{"pageNumber":616,"pageContent":"the nature of the events and the location, and the elders would dothe organizing.

They appealto one identity and not another. It is natural to enjoy talking in,say, Gujarati, about family, friends and memories in the old coun-try, but that feeling of togetherness necessarily makes others whoare not fluent in Gujarati feel excluded—again, not only Iraniansbut also the youth. It should also be noted, of course, that IranianZoroastrians have strong ties to their language, food, memoriesand music. The different cultural identities are difficult to recon-cile if they are not both grounded in a Zoroastrian identity anda shared language.NumbersAlthough it is not possible to give exact figures over the years, a gen-eral picture can be given of those who have joined the Association,and who asserted on a census that they are Zoroastrian. The 1997Australian census recorded 347 Zoroastrians in the state ofVictoria, with 333 in the city of Melbourne.187In 1999–2000 theofficial list of subscribers listed eighty members, fifty seven withfamily membership, nineteen single and four ‘other’. Allowing foran average of 2.5 persons per family, that would give a membershiptotal of approximately 108 (137 if three persons per family).

The 1992 Directory listed 283Zoroastrians (in the case of twenty-four families the names sug-gested that they were intermarried).Divisions within the communityOne academic criticism of my Zoroastrians in Britainwas thatZoroastrians were presented as without fault, and that not enoughattention was given to the arguments within the community.Writing about divisions can be harmful to the people one iswriting about, because it highlights potential or real wounds, canreinforce divisions, and gives long-term, worldwide importance towhat may be private, personal and in need of forgetful silence. Butof course communities do row, sometimes very bitterly and pub-licly. What they disagree over can be as important for an under-standing of a community as what they agree on. If the historianis to tell it ‘as it really is’, then disputes have to be discussed. Butthe following seeks to avoid personal questions as much as possi-ble (though of course personality clashes are common) andfocuses on issues, not names.The causes of disputes are similar in most Parsi communities:generational problems, tensions between Iranian Zoroastrians andParsis, or Orthodox versus Reform arguments, especially relatingto intermarriage. Another common cause of tension can be thehurt feelings of the ‘early settlers’ when later arrivals seek to change,or are thought not to value, what had been achieved. Otherwise tensions or problems arise between the religious and non-religiousmembers over priorities; the drive for influence can be a powerfulcause of tension, even though it has sometimes been difficult to findpeople to take up major offices, notably president, because of thedemands it makes on time. Yet, of course, many are ready to criti-cize their officers. What matters deeply to one person—‘a buildingof our own’ or religious functions—can seem unimportant toanother. Sometimes in large groups individual personal tensionsZoroastrians in Australia598"},{"pageNumber":618,"pageContent":"can be relatively insignificant; in a small community such asMelbourne that cannot be, and personality clashes can erupt anddominate Association affairs for a long time. At such times, people’smotives are frequently called into question. Well-intentionedinitiatives have sometimes been interpreted as ego trips; tensionssimmering beneath the surface can erupt as part of another issue,resulting in fury and hurt, lawsuits and threats of legal action, indivisions and departures from the Association. The period1999–2002 has been a time of particular communal tension inMelbourne, a time when disputes were so intense that they spilledover to affect other Associations. In an ideal world, such a smallgroup would stand together to withstand the threat of communalextinction, but human life in general, and Parsi life in particular, isnot like that. Assertions of unity and harmony in newsletters do notalways reflect the reality of daily community life. Vituperativeexchanges drive away from the Association those whose commit-ment is not already unshakeable, not least the youth, whose involve-ment is crucial to the survival of the Association. They also driveapart erstwhile friends, even friends whose collaboration has previ-ously been crucial to the history of the Association. As old battlesare refought, wounds reopen and so other conflicts erupt. Outsidersrarely appreciate the complexities of internal disputes in small dias-pora communities, or understand the strength of feeling in whatNaficy (see Chapter 1) might describe as the recreated world of theold country.ConclusionAustralian Zoroastrians in both Sydney and Melbourne arecharacterized by two features: their strong ties to the old countryand a very firm commitment to their new one. Both communitieshave affirmed publicly their identity as Australian citizens. This isparticularly noteworthy in the Melbourne constitution. Theirreactions to other Asian groups in their city have been different.In Sydney there have been cultural and sporting links with otherIndian groups. In Melbourne there was, for many years, a straightrefusal to be linked to a cross-community Indian organization.Because of both groups’ positive perceptions of Australia, therehave been various moves with regard to immigration, basicallyZoroastrians in Australia599"},{"pageNumber":619,"pageContent":"reassuring co-religionists in the old country that they will not finddiscrimination,188and that very few ever want to go back. But theyhave also stressed some of the difficulties in finding a first job, inpart because of initial discrimination in the work-place and inpart because of the problems arising from non-recognition ofmany Indian qualifications.189There has also been a cautionarynote about the skills needed to gain entry under the pointssystem.190New settlers are regularly welcomed in the columns ofthe newsletters, and help is often given, but because of the typicalParsi diaspora unhappiness with a ghetto, Zoroastrian familieslive in different parts of cities and so the level of practical helpcan be limited.As a growing centre, Sydney sees itself as having a leadingrole in the southern hemisphere, and is seeking to pioneer theFederation of Australian Zoroastrian Associations (FEZAA, amove inspired by the American FEZANA). The scope is seenas potentially spreading beyond Australia and could includeNew Zealand, Singapore and even Hong Kong but in 2000the Association consists just of AZA Sydney, Melbourne, andone group in New Zealand. It is likely that in the early years of thethird millennium Australasia will continue to be a growth centrefor Zoroastrianism, as Britain has on the whole closed its doors toimmigration and in Canada and the USA the immigration tap isturned off and on. A few new small centres are growing, notablyin Perth (Zoroastrian population estimated at 150), Brisbane(where there are said to be thirty families), and New Zealand,which is growing steadily.191It was noted at the beginning of thechapter how more educated and professional the Asian popula-tion as a whole is in comparison with wider Australian society.The Zoroastrians are yet more highly educated. In general terms,the Zoroastrians are having smaller families, have less extensiveZoroastrians in Australia600188See e.g. Mahbanu Ostowari, in her Parsianainterview, May–June 1978, p. 15.189Parsiana, July 1990, p. 16. The new president of the AZA, Nauzer Bana, in an inter-view with Parsiana, July–Aug. 1998, pp. 34–38b, related how his Indian accountancy qual-ifications had not been recognized and he had to study for seven years to gain recognition.190Noshir Irani in Parsiana, Aug. 1983, p. 11 in response to what he thought had beenan over-emphasis on the ease of entry to Australia from a Melbourne Parsi.

Nor do they have the material andfinancial resources to undertake such projects as communityschools. But in comparison with other Zoroastrian diasporagroups, they are clearly centres of growing importance. TheAustralian Zoroastrians have a much higher proportion of Indian-born members than the Associations in Britain, Canada and theUSA, lacking significant numbers from Pakistan or East Africa.The fact that the Australian Associations are more recent devel-opments is probably the explanation for the more widespread useof Gujarati at functions and in newsletters, something rare inother ‘western’ Zoroastrian publications. But the links with theIranian Zoroastrians, and the rise of the younger generation,probably mean that the Australians too will use less Gujarati, andgradually the self-description of Zoroastrian rather than Parsi (orIranian Zoroastrian?) will grow. Thus far, Australian Zoroastrianslack the religious education infrastructure that has grownespecially in Canada and the USA. Without that there must besome concern about the fulfilment of the aspiration to hand theheritage on to their young children.The similarities and differences between the Melbourne andSydney Associations are diverse. In both there is a strong Aussiepatriotism. Each has experienced some problems with the IranianZoroastrian–Parsi divide, but at the end of the millennium thestress on Indian links—with the Indian Association, the emphasison Gujarati jokes, cartoons and functions—made the divisionmore evident in Melbourne. Both Associations have problems inattracting the youth to their activities, and in each centre theyoung people said that the Indian-ness, but above all the disputes,were what distanced them from the culture which their elderswere pressing. In each community there has been a debate onwhether religious or secular culture is the raison d’êtreof theAssociation. The emphasis inevitably varies from president topresident, from one committee to another, in each city, but theacquisition of a building where religious functions can be cele-brated has resulted in more of a religious dimension in Sydneythan in Melbourne. Ultimately the big difference is the obviousone of size, and the implications that has for the possibility ofhaving a building and for mounting activities which attract differ-ent groups.

Theinterpretation of the term varies considerably, as do the accountsof its origins. Some, notably Giddens, consider it a consequenceof modernism, others see it as the precursor of modernism, trac-ing its origins back to the time when large sailing ships replacedvessels propelled simply by oars, a change which resulted in globalexploration.1Globalization is evident in some aspects of life, forexample, in economic markets, but has been seen as a trend inmany dimensions of life, including religion. One aspect of suchstudies is not only the identification of global patterns, but also thegrowth of particularist responses to globalization, for example,fundamentalism in certain religions, notably Christianity andIslam. In the case of Christianity, globalization is seen as relatedto the growth of world empires, especially western imperialism.This chapter will focus on four issues: 1. The formation of a worldbody, the World Zoroastrian Organization; 2. The Internet com-munications which remove geographical distance to facilitateinstant communication; 3. The Millennium World ZoroastrianCongress in Houston, Texas, in 2000, perhaps the largest gather-ings of Zoroastrians from around the world for many centuries;4. The global patterns identified in the survey.1As I do not seek to undertake a comprehensive study of the various debates it is notnecessary to provide a full bibliography. The following are the books that I found thought-provoking in this particular context: P. Beyer,Religion and Globalization, London, 1994(especially the case studies in part 2); M. Featherstone (ed.),Global Culture, London, 1990;A. Giddens,Modernity and Self Identity, Cambridge, 1991; R. Robertson and W. Garrett(eds.),Religion and Global Order, New York, 1991; R. Robertson,Globalization, London, 1992.From the perspective of wider studies of globalization there are several major authorsomitted from this list, notably I. Wallerstein."},{"pageNumber":623,"pageContent":"There are other aspects of Zoroastrian globalization whichothers may have chosen to include, notably the growing genre ofthe Parsi novel in English (there has not been a comparablegrowth in Iranian Zoroastrian literature). Some of these novelshave been turned into films.2There have been two studies of theParsi novel.3Since their publication more novels have appeared,4and further studies are to be hoped for. Most of these novels werepublished first in India, then in the West. Despite their importancein the understanding of the various communities from which theyemerged, I am not convinced that they are the outcome, orexpression, of Zoroastrian globalization. They are fairly widelyread by Parsis both in India and the West, and two authors inparticular, Bapsi Sidhwa and Rohinton Mistry, are read and fêted,but even their works tend to focus on the communities back inPakistan or India respectively. Sidhwa’s latest novel focuses onmigration from the subcontinent to America,5but I still do notthink that it is a feature of globalization. As well as constituting‘good reads’ they are also important as examples of Parsi humour,family and social values and not least because of the image theyseek to project of their religion, namely as an abstract ethicalmonotheism, but stressing particularly the emotional power ofParsi devotions before the fire.6Almost all choose to give a sym-pathetic account of those practices which provoke external com-ment, notably funeral rites. They also convey the deep sense ofcommunal pride which typifies, and understandably so, the com-munities. Several also reflect the popular practices associated withgood luck signs and the evil eye. An example of a video which isperhaps more reflective of globalization is Tenaz Dubash’s In theFootsteps of Our Forefathers, 2000, which follows a group of youngAmerican Zoroastrians on a religious pilgrimage to the ancientGlobalizing Trends6042For example Sidhwa’s book Ice Candy Man(London, 1988) into a Hindi film withEnglish subtitles,Earth.

This proposal was reaffirmed at the Second andThird World Congresses in Bombay (1976 and 1978). In a seriesof papers at the Third World Congress several prominent indi-viduals pressed the case for such a body. Farangis Shahrokhargued that: ‘dispersal led to fragmentation and resulted in out-marriage. It is the desire and fervent wish of the few Zoroastriansso widely scattered over the globe, to see and feel that an organ-isation does in fact exist which can provide a continuity and a solidlink with their co-religionists in other parts of the world.’ KekiBhote of New York similarly pressed the case that: ‘Either we plantogether, organise together, work together and manage ourselvesto preserve our religion and our way of life, or—we go it alone,ISLANDSunto ourselves, until our anarchy drowns us into extinc-tion.’ His fellow American Zoroastrian, Eruch Munshi, argued forthe establishment of an umbrella organization and apex bodybased at the BPP.9After this Congress, J.

One of the reasons for the proposal wasto provide support for small groups of Zoroastrians living in(potentially) alien settings, East Africa and Pakistan being identi-fied as possible problem areas. As fears grew over the future ofZoroastrians in Iran in the late 1970s, so the pleas for such a bodygrew. Dr Farhang Mehr, then Chancellor of Tehran Universityand previously Deputy Prime Minister in Iran, encouraged suchmoves. During a visit to London, he urged Shahpur Captain (whohad been elected president of ZTFE in 1978) to take the initiativeand set up a world body based in the stable British political andeconomic climate where there would be no problems with foreignexchange.10Another guiding figure was Dr Jal Bulsara, who hadextensive global experience from his work in the United Nations.The platform for the launch of the World ZoroastrianOrganization (WZO) was a seminar, which Bulsara led, at theLondon School of Economics in 1977. The concern was that asnothing had been done for eighteen years, some vulnerableZoroastrians would be left without an international voice to speakon their behalf. The political situation in Iran was a major factorin the decision to set up such a body in London. On 8 May 1978Jal Bulsara urged the BPP to set up a world body with its head-quarters in Bombay, and regional offices in Britain and America.11He, along with Sohrab Godrej, had a meeting with the BPP to tryto persuade them to act, but without success.The foundationAll the earliest calls for a WZO argued for a world body based inBombay, specifically under the aegis of the BPP.

In a circular let-ter sent to leading Zoroastrians worldwide, Captain noted theproblems of Zoroastrians in East Africa, Pakistan and Iran,but stressed that ‘WZO will be a socio-religious body and nota political organization. We will invite all individuals Zarthustisand Anjumans to join it.’12At the founding of the WZODr (Mrs) Kutar gave a specific example: ‘I know, for example,at present there are just seven Zoroastrian individuals (adults)in Zanzibar. When in near future the World ZoroastrianOrganisation writes to them, and they get the news of formationof a World Body, their eyes will fill with tears of joy, knowingsomeone knows of them and is interested in them.’ This initiativewas undertaken by the then officers of the ZTFE in London,notably Shahpur Captain and Dr (Mrs) Kutar. Most of thoseinvited to be members of the new body agreed, for example,Jamshed Pavri, Rusi and Sabar Bulsara, Behram Farhadieh, DadyMistry (Delhi) and some leading Iranian Zoroastrians—ArbabRustom Guiv, Dr Rustom Sarfeh, Mehraban Zarthoshty,Mehraban Faranghi and Rostam Yaganegi. Guzder of the BPPdid not reply to his invitation. The first meeting was held atZoroastrian House in London on 18 July 1980, when Captainset out the global vision of WZO. One of the priorities, he said,‘is to synthesize our people. At present a Zarthushti in Karachiis a Karachiite, and one in Calcutta is a Calcutta-ite. But ifboth join WZO, maybe their thinking may change and they mayfeel one with each other.’ His second point was that: ‘Local leadersor Anjumans see the problems in local terms and are not gearedto looking at problems from a global point of view. The commit-tee of WZO can give a different perspective than that given bya local body.’13The initial membership consisted of seventeen people fromBritain, four from Iran, two from India, two from USA and onefrom Canada, but following an intensive membership drive thebalance was soon modified.

However, controversy soon arose.The first protest came from Jamshed Pavri, who contested the original constitution, saying it was not international enoughin that it excluded intermarried spouses from membership;15thiswas a view supported by Mrs Farangis Shahrokh, a prominentZoroastrian in California.16Invitations were circulated to allAnjumans globally and separate letters of invitation were sent toprominent figures such as Nani Palkiwala in Bombay and NoshirIrani in Sydney. The aim clearly was to attract prominent leadersin order to benefit from their connections.To some extent the early priorities of WZO were a reactionagainst what was widely seen as the failure of the establishedbodies, such as the BPP, to act. The driving spirit was similar tothat expressed by North American leaders when Bombay author-ities ignored their questions.17From the early days a major issuewas the role and influence of Bombay leaders and organizations.In order to encourage grassroots involvement, and with somedisappointment at the lethargy of established bodies, membershipdrives were focused on individuals, though Anjumans werealso invited. Captain explained the thinking on this in a letter toMehraban Zarthoshty:we came to the conclusion that individual Zoroastrians should getout of their slumber and join each other in this enterprise. In otherwords the WZO should have real support of the grass rootsZoroastrians....Secondly, it is individuals who voice their views at theannual general meetings and at any time they want to, so that a con-sensus emerges and we come to know what our people feel and think. Itis the basis of each and every democratic body and WZO is such a dem-ocratic body....Finally it was felt that if the WZO were to be the apexorganisation of all the Anjumans/Associations, then the individualZoroastrian would have no interest and the real feeling of belonging toa world wide community would not be gendered.18Globalizing Trends60814Indeed, the constitution was so similar, the British authorities turned down its originaldrafting (letter dated 13 Aug. 1979).15He also objected to the publication of the constitution without prior consultation.16Letter dated 26 Apr. 1980.17See Chapter 8, ‘Religious authority in the diaspora’.18Letter dated 21 Apr. 1981."},{"pageNumber":628,"pageContent":"One of the first to join was the Delhi Anjuman.

From the start numerous letters were sent byWZO officers to the chairman and trustees of the BPP, andduring annual visits to India WZO officials regularly met andcorresponded with the trustees, and the Federation, to seek someaccommodation.23Early meetings were held in March–April1983.24The Indian response, expressed particularly by BPP, butalso in Surat and Delhi, was that the WZO should be an apexbody of Anjumans, and there should be no provision for thevoting of individuals. They wanted to see such a body chairedby the BPP, with representatives from other Indian Associations.25The headquarters of such a body, it was said, must be in Bombay.Many Associations (for example, Bangalore and Hyderabad)raised the question of intermarriages and expressed concern thatGlobalizing Trends60919Letter to Shahpur Captain, 30 June 1981.20Letter to Shahpur Captain from Jehan Bagli, then of Montreal, and editor of one ofthe most successful American newsletters,Gavashni.21S.

For example, he clashed with Jamshed Pavri at the 1981 VancouverAGM by supporting WZO.22This is commented on in much WZO correspondence, e.g. Captain to DadiEngineer, 2 Sept. 1996. As I was present at the time I can confirm the accuracy of thestatement.23e.g. Captain to Kanga, 11 Mar. 1982; reply 29 May 1982 arguing that the world bodyshould be a federation of Anjumans in various countries.24Parsiana, 1983 June reported the Indian tour of the WZO officers and includeda photograph of them meeting the Prime Minister, Mrs Gandhi.25Report of Shahpur Captain’s India tour, 28 Mar.–30 Apr. 1983 submitted to theWZO board."},{"pageNumber":629,"pageContent":"the definition of a ‘Zoroastrian’ would be interpreted in aReformist manner.26The proposal of giving each Associationa single vote was not viewed by many, in India and beyond, to beadequate representation for large and long-established bodies.27Maneck Gheyara, president of the Surat Punchayet, expressedconcern that a world body facing such a diversity of practices indifferent areas might seek to direct what local groups should do.28A substantial, but rarely articulated, concern was power. Whoeverheaded the world body would be seen as having considerablestanding and influence within the community, and different indi-viduals were perceived to be seeking that power for themselves.Despite the fact that the BPP had failed to act as agreed atcongresses, the trustees were of the unequivocal view that ‘sucha world body can be created only under the auspices of the BPPand in Bombay, and that the governing body should be entirely inthe hands of the trustees of the BPP.’29They also feared thecontrol of power leaving India and going to people in London. Inreply, WZO officers asserted that this body was to be democratic,unlike many of the Punchayets where there was not universal suf-frage (Bombay) or where trustees were not elected at all (Surat).30A few Indian Anjumans joined WZO (e.g. Calcutta, Nagpur andoriginally Delhi) but none of the major old ones did so. Tensionswithin Indian Associations, for example at Delhi, affected WZOattempts to grow.Strong early supporters in India were Dadi Mistry in Delhiand Jehan Daruwalla, the editor of the Bombay Samachar.

It was also commonly asserted that theIndian voice should dominate, and the headquarters should be inBombay.32To counter the last point, WZO developed an Indianchapter, with Dadi Engineer in the chair, and Dadi Mistry assecretary. Palkiwalla was a relatively early member of the chapter,and Taleyarkhan joined later. One problem in India, and else-where, was what many involved spoke of as ‘coping with the bigegos’. People wanted to have power to make pronouncements anddevelop policies free of London involvement. Some resented theinfluential role of the London members.33The motive to involveprominent individuals for their standing and influence sometimesrebounded against WZO as some of those individuals werethought to seek self-aggrandizement. Some of its early supporterslater became WZO’s critics.34A ‘rival’ world body?A public attempt to marginalize WZO, and start a rival, India-based body, took place at the 1984 World Congress in Bombay.35In a preliminary circular the organizer, Jimmy Guzder, proposedthat the fifth of the main topics to be discussed in the programmeshould be the creation of a world body. He wrote:As there is a need for a properly constituted and representative worldbody, in view of the scattering of the community in different parts ofthe globe, under this topic, speakers would discuss the constitution,membership, organisation structure, location and other aspects for sucha World Body.

Pavri toCaptain, 7 May 1984 saying they resented any implication that WZO could oversee mat-ters of local Anjumans, and were unhappy at the drawing up of the constitution being a‘fait accompli’ with no consultation.34Six of the original twenty-six signatories became stern critics of WZO.35The following account is based on a report by Shahpur Captain to the ManagingCommittee, which was published almost verbatim in the WZO Newsletter, 5 Mar. 1985.I was at the Congress and heard directly from participants of the arguments."},{"pageNumber":631,"pageContent":"world to give their views on the manner in which the world bodyshould be constituted, so that there is an equitable system of represen-tation, and how it should function in view of the dispersal of the com-munity all over the world. These views would be discussed and acommittee constituted for implementing the recommendations asapproved by the Congress.Not only did this make no reference to the existing WZO; itsofficers were not invited to the Congress, and were admitted onlyafter a protest.36At the Congress Eruch Desai was the only BPPtrustee to speak positively about WZO. He argued that thereshould not be two bodies, but that the world body should be basedon Anjumans, not individuals. Existing individual members heargued should remain; though with no voting powers and nonew individuals should be admitted. The Managing Committeeshould consist of six vice-presidents, secretaries and treasurers toreflect the six main regions: America, Europe, Middle East (Iran,Pakistan, Gulf States, Central Asia), Greater Bombay, the rest ofIndia and the Far East (from Hong Kong to Australia). Around themain programme of the World Congress there were various pri-vate meetings of interested parties, mostly Desai, Guzder andGolwala who represented BPP, K. D. Irani, Dadi Engineerand Mistry and Captain. Captain proposed that each individualperson and Anjuman should have one vote, but there could be asmany as 100 Anjumans. There should be two main committees,with fifteen persons representing the Anjumans and fifteen repres-enting the individuals, with the chair alternating between the twogroups.The session of the Congress allocated to discussions on a worldbody was chaired by Farhang Mehr. The outcome of the debatewas that the Congress members recommended that the presentWZO should be supported and strengthened, individual mem-bership should remain, the headquarters should be in London, noAnjuman or group should control WZO, and a bi-cameral bodyshould be developed, with committees of Anjumans and of indi-viduals balancing each other. After the debate, BPP and WZOrepresentatives met privately. Captain suggested some modifica-tions to meet the objections to the constitution so that any majorissue (the definition of what constituted a ‘major’ issue to beGlobalizing Trends61236Letter of protest from Captain dated 27 Oct. 1984."},{"pageNumber":632,"pageContent":"defined by a mutually accepted lawyer) would require a majorityof 75%, which would mean that individuals could not outvote theinstitutions (or vice versa). He also suggested that the BPP joinfor a trial period of twenty years to see how WZO worked. Butagreement proved impossible. During these public and privatemeetings, Shiavax Nargolwala, an early member and supporter ofWZO, constantly attacked WZO and threatened it with courtaction over various issues. But he died in a car crash in August1986, and so his threats were never fulfilled.37Other frequentattacks were made by Aspi Golwalla, then chairman of the BPP,who said he had heard that WZO did not have as many membersas had been thought, and so asked them to supply membershipnumbers.38In Britain leadership of the Trust Funds changed (see Chapter 7above). In 1985 there was a considerable furore over the refusal toallow Mrs Moos, the Dutch widow of the former and respectedchair Jehangir D. Moos, to attend the annual death prayers(Farvardigan) prayers at Brookwood, something she had alwaysdone previously. The priestly Sethna brothers (Zal and Darius),and other East African Parsis, objected to what they saw as the liberalizing of Zoroastrian traditions concerning juddinsatFarvardiganormuktadprayers. In May 1987 Captain (followed byMrs Kutar and Rumi Sethna and half the committee) resignedfrom ZTFE because resolutions Captain was known to opposehad been passed during his absence in hospital. In October thatyear the new ZTFE management asked the WZO officers toremove all their papers and possessions from Zoroastrian House.39ZTFE was now clearly separated from, indeed opposed to, WZO.Mutual antagonism became deep, and long lasting.WZO’s main support in these early years, apart from a fewprominent individuals, came from outside India. These ‘overseas’Zoroastrians tended to think differently, especially on the issue ofthe BPP not being in a position of control. So Karachi trusteeD. B.

This work continues in thethird millennium, for WZO appealed on behalf of people fromTajikistan who they accepted had become Zoroastrians.44Theyalso sought redress for the many Zoroastrian properties taken overby governments in different countries such as China and Aden.45Work on behalf of individuals has been extensive: collecting theestate of a Zoroastrian who died in Britain for his family inAmerica, tracing creditors in various parts of the world andarranging for the settlement of debts.In 1984 WZO began organizing a series of academic confer-ences, bringing together speakers from inside the community andfrom the outside academic world. A second was organized in 1986( proceedings published 1986), and a later meeting was organizedin Chicago (1987, proceedings published 1990), and others againin London.46Perhaps its largest such venture was the first WorldGatha colloquium in London in1993.47The influential JamshedPavri from Vancouver had argued, ‘I always tell my communitynot to invite any non-Zoroastrians or non-Zoroastrian scholars atany of our conventions or gatherings, but it seems fashionable todo so.’48These WZO conferences brought together an inter-national team of speakers. In the Gatha colloquium, for example,outside scholars who took part included P. Thieme andH. Humbach (Germany), I. Gershevitch, P. Kreyenbroek (stillthen in England), S. Insler and M. Schwartz (USA).

It boldlydeclared ‘That a communication gap on a global basis existsamong Zoroastrians is a fact none can deny. However to BRIDGEthis gap as far as possible shall be Hamazor’s sincere endeavour.’ Attimes it has proved difficult to find individuals, already in full-timework, to edit and contribute to the newsletter. It has also been dif-ficult to balance both the interests of the Indian readers it wishedto attract, and global concerns.49Indeed, a general problem forWZO, especially in the early years, was that its work was carriedout by working people who undertook this voluntary task in theirown spare time.

Thevideos were taken by WZO officers when visiting communities inorder to raise funds for the work, notably to Hong Kong, the GulfStates, America, Canada and Australia. The journeys in Gujaratwere not always easy. Without proper roads they had to resort tobullock carts, or walk ankle-deep in mud over long distances.65Ata meeting with Tamboly and Captain in Surat in January 1989,the Surat trustees stressed the problems faced by Parsi farmers inGujarat as a result of the banning of toddy production, thenationalization of transport (a number of Parsis had run buses asa source of income) and new legislation which had curtailed theirchances to farm effectively.66Some of the experiences related are,by any standards, heart-rending: elderly widows and widowersunable to dig wells, repair homes, or earn even a minimum wage.One of the main problems was the complete dependence onunreliable monsoons, which could either wash crops away ornot come at all, thus leading to drought. Some of the villages werea considerable distance from a road, so contacting individualswas difficult. The huts in which people lived were often indesperate need of urgent repair. In a report for Bombay SamacharandParsiana, Tamboly wrote of the conditions of these poorZoroastrians:Many of our community members will be surprised and distressed toknow that our coreligionists live in huts, the walls of which are madefrom mud; the floors are of cowdung which require a fresh lick everymonth. Most of these families do not have wells of their own and haveto draw water for their daily needs from the common village well; duringthe hot summer months when the water level drops appreciably, a lineforms for drawing water from 2.00 in the morning.

To this end WZO gave help to dig ordeepen wells, and supplied pumps and engines to water the land sothat the farmers were not completely dependent on unpredictablemonsoons. Tractors were hired to level the land and make it betterfor farming. Where necessary, people were supplied with bullocksfor work on the farms. Able-bodied young men were sent on col-lege courses on farming at an agricultural college in Navsari, andexperts were taken to the farms to advise the farmers on economicplanting, for example trees which after eight years could be cut andsold. Where the land could not be farmed, people were enabledto start poultry and rabbit farms, women were supplied withsewing machines, flour-grinding mills were started and nurserieswere planted for the supply of appropriate plants or saplings.In some cases young couples in the villages were helped to marryand raise a family by purchasing a small ‘cottage’ for them and pro-viding the funds to help bring up their children (e.g. by payingthe necessary medical costs), until such time as the couple couldbecome economically self-supporting.68Some youngsters werefunded to stay at the Surat or Navsari orphanages so that theycould have an education.69The vulnerability of the villagers washighlighted by three successive years of drought up to 1993. But inthe following year there was extensive flooding which destroyedcrops, homes, bridges and poultry farms and killed the cattle.70Itwas decided at the outset that help should be targeted to villageswhere the precise details were known of people’s extreme poverty,so that help could be seen to be given to the truly needy.

One example of thismutual suspicion was an article published in the Bombay Samacharon 16 September 1990, by the then chairman of the BPP, whichwas specifically on the work for poor farmers in Gujarat. Itnever once mentioned the initiative of WZO.72In 1993,ParsianaandBombay Samacharpublished letters from the Surat Punchayetmarginalizing the role of WZO in the Gujarat farmers’ project,which Captain rejected in a responding letter.73The Federationwas seen as making criticisms from the sidelines without contribut-ing to the work.74By the end of the year 2000, WZO had worked in 149 villagesassisting 355 families, with 164 families supplied with pumps, 149with pipelines. Up to that date WZO had raised Rs 28,468,990specifically for this work.75They had also helped poor Parsis set upin business by providing such items as computers, and taxis, and pay-ing for training for a motor mechanic with funds donated from theJijibhoy Trusts. One factor in WZO’s ability to raise such funding isthat the project in general, and Tamboly in particular, gained respectfor the transparency and integrity of the organization’s accountingand its prompt use of the money to help identified individualswith specific needs.76It was these features, for example, which led theHong Kong Anjuman to start supporting such projects.77In 1992 Globalizing Trends62171To give but two examples from the many in the records, on 31 May 1991, WZO hadthat year raised Rs 471,655 plus £3,026. The BPP and Surat Punchayet each continuedto give the original agreed figure of Rs 200,000. Similarly in 1993 whereas the SuratPunchayet and the BPP continued their donation of Rs 200,000 the WZO contributionwas Rs 1,514,949 (Tamboly to Captain, 30 July 1993).72The same is true of an appeal made by Golwala in the Jame, 7 Oct. 1990, for fundsfor the projects, which asked for money to be sent to him at the Federation, but did notmention WZO.73Captain to J.

Criticism wasnever far away, however.

The amount of money spent on different projects var-ied according to which appeals met with the greatest response in anyone year. So, for example, in 1994 WZO spent 400% more on med-ical aid than in Gujarat; indeed, it spent more that year on its mobedFund than on Gujarat causes. There are times when the evident suc-cess in Gujarat has eclipsed some of the other work done by WZO.Its officers feel that sometimes it is dismissed as ‘merely’ a charitableinstitution. For example, the president of the BPP wrote:At present the WZO is functioning like a Welfare Trust doing good workin different parts of India and contributes its funds for good causes.While this is creditable it does not thereby qualify to be considered asa world body. We, therefore, feel that perhaps it would be better if WZOcontinues to do this good work and functions as a welfare trust for thebenefit of the community and gives up its pretensions as the world bodyfor Zoroastrians which it cannot obviously be when the majority ofFederations and Anjuman [sic] are not its members.78In response to this WZO officers have commented to me in priv-ate conversation that BPP has traditionally presented itself as awelfare body.

In 1993 a different controversy opened up concerningWZO. Following a vote of members, it was decided that non-Zoroastrian spouses and children of mixed marriages couldbecome members of WZO. As was noted above, it was in largepart because WZO did not originally do this that Pavri resignedand attacked the organization. It was a step which the BombayOrthodox had suspected from the beginning because of the mem-bership of Kersey Antia and because Ali Jafarey had been invitedto speak at the workshops. The president of ZTFE was quick tocondemn the move, saying: ‘We submit that WZO would, inessence, become a non-communal body with the distinct possib-ility of it being governed in the future by non-Zoroastrians.WZO would then cease to exist as a Zoroastrian body if yourproposals are accepted by the members.’ He agreed that thisstep meant that they would not get money from Zoroastriancharities and the move would cause dissensions and divisions.79There was also a letter of protest from Pakistan, because of Parsivulnerability in Muslim countries if Zoroastrians were seen toconvert.80The WZO view was that, in the global perspective,intermarriage was increasing dramatically and it did not wish todivide families by excluding spouses and children. It also pointedout that non-Zoroastrian spouses could not hold office.81Someprominent figures in India resigned over the issue, for example,Dastur Meherjirana and Dadrawalla, who had edited Hamazor.Some wrote in confidence saying they felt that their positionrequired them to do this, but in private they continued to supportthe work of WZO. The resignations were mostly from Indian-based groups, for example, the Deolali/Nasik ZoroastrianAnjuman82and the D. J.

After the World Congress in Bombay, 8 January 1990,there was a meeting of a newly established ‘Inter-RegionalZoroastrian Congress Committee’, which comprised the chair-man of the BPP (Guzder), nine people from India (including twohonorary secretaries), two from FEZANA (Homji and Rivetna),two from Iran (Shahzadi and Mehraban Kushesh) and two fromBritain (Dalal and the then president, Jussawalla). The purposewas said to be to implement the recommendations of the WorldCongress, though there were no WZO officers among the invitees,despite the congress recommendation on Item V (see above).Specialist groups were established to deal with specific issues.Other names were given for people to be invited to join the coun-cil, for example, a representative from Australia and Pakistan. Thechair was to be the chair of the BPP and the headquarters wereto be in Bombay. The agreement was to focus on four recom-mendations: 1. Demographic trends; 2. Youth; 3. Religiouseducation (to produce suitable books and train teachers); 4. Socialwelfare, particularly the problems of the poor and aged. They alsoincluded the long-term goal of the creation of a world body. TheInter-regional Congress Committee seems to have done little toimplement these aims.The following year Rivetna held a meeting with WZO officersin London (21 September).85It concluded amicably with the pro-posal that the Federation and Anjumans should form a council,the ‘WZO Sub-committee of Federations and Anjumans’, and ameeting of these groups was to be called in London in 1992. Butin June of 1992 the BPP refused to accept the principle thatindividuals could have the same voting powers as Anjumans. Italso objected to the idea that the Council of Federations was onlya subcommittee of the parent body, WZO, which it was said cur-rently, ‘just functions as a welfare trust’.86Similarly, Rivetna hadwritten two months earlier (April 1992) that one could not talkof Federations and Associations ‘joining WZO’; rather, the aimwas to establish a new ‘Council of Federations’ and the follow-upGlobalizing Trends62485An account is given in Hamazor, Autumn–Winter 1997, pp. 11–21.86Guzder to Captain, 22 June 1992."},{"pageNumber":644,"pageContent":"question was, how this new Council affiliated with WZO.87In1992 Rivetna said it would be premature to call the plannedConstitutional Convention, because there had been no forwardmovement. Instead, he said, the idea was emerging of an inde-pendent Confederation of Anjumans.The next surge in the debate was associated with a plannedinformal meeting of interested parties to follow the WorldParliament of Religions in Chicago in 1993, where a numberof Zoroastrian participants were expected. During his visits toEngland and India, Rivetna proposed a Federation of Anjumans,pointing not only to FEZANA in America, but also to theFederation in India and the potential for one in both Europe andthe Pacific (including Hong Kong and Singapore as well asAustralia and New Zealand). He, and others, also saw the poten-tial for a Federation of Anjumans in the Middle East with Iranand some countries in the Gulf. The aim was to establish an apexbody that would unite all Zoroastrians everywhere in a way whichmany thought WZO did not do because of its emphasis on indi-viduals. This was the subject for the post-World Parliament meet-ing. At the FEZANA AGM on 13 July that year the followingmotion was passed:Be it resolved that a constitutional convention be convened in Chicago todraft a constitution for a Council of Federations under the auspices ofFEZANA in September 1993, being the opportune time when representat-ives from India, Australia, London, possibly Iran and elsewhere areexpected to be in Chicago for the centennial celebration of the 1893 WorldParliament of Religions, and that Rohinton Rivetna organise the event.At the Chicago meeting, WZO was severely criticized by one itsformer patrons, though others, notably K. D. Irani and AdiDavar, sought to find a middle way. They suggested that WZOremain the sole world body, but that it adapt a constitution whichgave authority over certain matters, notably those other than wel-fare work, to the ‘House’ or ‘Body’ of Federations in a bicameralstructure.88The debates over the changed constitution, however,proved to be long-lasting.

This debate was not confined to America. AsHomi Homji from Toronto put it: ‘Strong egos, power politics andvested interests are inhibiting the global diaspora from comingtogether to work out a proper solution. I call for networking.’90The argument for a World Council of Zoroastrian Federations(WCZF), which found favour in India, was largely associated inthe West with Rohinton Rivetna. An article in Parsianaon theWorld Council of Zoroastrian Federations which had been agreedby BPP, Federation, FEZANA and ZTFE proposed a voting sys-tem such that no one group could dominate.91There were others who thought differently: for example,Farhang Mehr argued that there should be no new body to rivalWZO, though he added his voice to the calls for reformation of theconstitution.92The strongest account of the argument againstthe proposed role of the Anjumans was put in a letter by Captainto Tamboly.93He adduced five reasons why he was cautious aboutthe role of the Anjumans. First, he said, one could not haveAnjumans outvoting the majority views of members. Second, hepointed out that Anjumans have a history of joining and thenleaving bodies, for example BPP and the Federation, or Delhi andthe WZO and ZTFE in and out of WZO.

Even so, heconcluded that it would be necessary to give Associations ‘greaterprominence’.97There were meetings in London and of theFederation to prepare the ground for the respective sides.98Davardrafted a proposed structure for WZO, and he wrote again onreceiving Captain’s response, urging him not to be defensive, andto work for more family memberships.99On 21 July 1997, Captaincirculated to Anjumans and Associations details of impendingfundamental structural changes in the WZO constitution. InIndia, Tamboly and the president of WZO (India), DadiEngineer, wrote a circular to all Anjumans in India listing twenty-eight activities that WZO was pursuing, pointing out that the factthat WZO can raise such large sums of money showed how muchconfidence people had in WZO.

This wasfirst indicated by the support for Iranian refugees, and the num-ber of new members from Iran elected at meetings, especially inthe first few years. In this debate the Iranian Zoroastrians did notsupport the BPP case. Dr Mahyar Ardeshiri from Tehran (as theman charged with implementing the recommendations of theSixth World Congress in Iran) wrote to Guzder with copies toDolly Dastoor, Rivetna and Captain.

His argument wasthat a small number of individuals had flouted the frequentlyexpressed views of the silent majority of Zoroastrians in estab-lishing a new body.

Indeed, in hisreport Irani concluded that FEZANA should join WZO: ‘I con-sider this draft entirely satisfactory to the concerns of FEZANA.’Rivetna circulated a report to FEZANA on the meeting of theregions that had taken place in London, 25–6 November, 2000,saying that they were nearly there with an agreement. Theoutstanding questions he identified as 1. The definition of aZoroastrian; 2. The inequitable voting at WZO general meetings;and 3. The use of proxy votes. He expressed himself confidant ofsuccess, and thought all would be settled at the forthcoming mil-lennium conference in Houston. It was perhaps optimistic to thinkof such success, since the meeting of the regions was not attendedby WZO, whose support could not therefore be assured.Globalizing Trends632111Letter to Rumi Sethna (copies to Rivetna and Patel) dated 21 Nov. 1999."},{"pageNumber":652,"pageContent":"At the Seventh World Zoroastrian Congress there were meetingsto discuss a world body.

At the time of writing,despite occasional affirmations of hope, it seems from the outsidethat the two sides are effectively as far apart as ever. The ‘grapevine’view is that a new world body will be formed.Some changing allegiances and recurring argumentsThe changing patterns of alliances are interesting. Whereas inreligious teaching America is generally seen as Liberal, in politicalmatters the BPP and the Indian Federation are closer to thereforms proposed by Rivetna. The Iranian view has broadlybeen supportive of WZO, apart from their opinion that theheadquarters should be in Iran.114Whereas the Jamehad origi-nally been opposed to WZO, by 2000 its new editor was support-ing WZO against the BPP because, it said, ‘people do not trustthe BPP’.115One of the arguments advanced by several people in the late1990s was that there had been a logic in the individual member-ship of WZO in the early 1980s, when relatively few ZoroastrianAssociations had been formed in many countries, e.g. America.But now that more Associations had been formed, withFederations in India, America and potentially in Europe, whatwas required was a world structure that reflected the importanceof Associations.116Both sides accused the other of preventingunity.

On the other hand, some of theopponents of WZO pointed to the deep antagonism between theLondon officers of WZO and ZTFE. The WCZF proponents alsoargued that WZO was not democratic, because its representativesin various countries were appointed not elected.117In its turn,the WZO pointed out that since the BPP was so unpopularin Mumbai, it could not be said to represent the Zoroastrianpopulation there; further, the voting process for trusteeship wasavailable to only approximately 3,000 of the city’s Parsi inhabi-tants. As noted above, some also pointed to the fact that the SuratPunchayet trustees had not been elected, but were appointed.118As WZO is criticized for not being truly representative, so also itin turn has questioned whether local Associations are truly repre-sentative, as it is widely accepted that only a half, or perhaps two-thirds, of the Zoroastrian population in any city actually jointheir local Association. Each side therefore charged the other withnot being democratic and with being divisive. A further argumentadduced by Rivetna was that the WZO constitution had had to beput together quickly by a few individuals and without much con-sultation because of the dramatic events in Iran and the urgentneed to have a body to work for Zoroastrians there.119In that situ-ation the ZTFE constitution had been used as the foundation ofWZO, but that, he said, was not appropriate in a world body.120Conversely, WZO has argued that the constitution of FEZANA isinappropriate for the establishment of a world body.Despite the remarkable work that WZO has undoubtedlyundertaken, and some amendments to its constitution, still thebattle appears to be over the basic issue of the Indian perspectivethat a world body has to be controlled from India, specificallythe BPP in Mumbai, and that such a global leadership should beentrusted to established Associations, not to individuals. To manyin Iran and the diaspora, not only WZO members, that demandseems unreasonable in view of the BPP’s failure to act over such along period from the 1960s to the 1980s.

After the Seventh World Congress the ZoroastrianAssociation of Houston brought forward a range of new pro-posals which made the existing WZO one of the Federations. Itsglobal work would give it substantial voting powers, but therequirement that a majority decision must have a 75% majoritywould mean that no one body, for example, the Federation inIndia, could succeed without building coalitions. A furtherproblem quickly emerged: both the Sydney and MelbourneAssociations withdrew from the Australian Federation. Accordingto rumours this was because their WZO members displayed moreloyalty to WZO than to their Associations. The virtual collapseof the Australian Federation made a world body consisting ofFederations difficult because it would leave out the only commu-nities in the southern hemisphere. The question of which body,and which individual, can be said to represent Zoroastrians ata global level remains embedded in dispute.Global Networks: Zoroastrians on the InternetInternet diversityThe Internet revolution has inevitably affected a community char-acterized by such high levels of education as the Zoroastrians.Search engines generally identify in excess of 2,000 sites onan Internet surf. This section omits those which are externallygenerated, notably sites from encyclopaedias and dictionaries, andlooks only at those run by Zoroastrians, especially those producedby Zoroastrians for their co-religionists. Inevitably sites change:some disappear, others appear, some alter dramatically, somebecome neglected. What is written about now may be changed bythe time this book is published. But the Internet is a majormedium of global communications at the start of the third mil-lennium, and so it merits serious attention. Even more transientphenomena than the formal websites are the various chat roomsset up by groups of individuals to which they subscribe, and inwhich they argue fiercely.

There are sites with fairly straightforward information.Joseph Peterson, whose naujotecaused such disputes in the 1980s,has maintained a site used by Zoroastrians of all persuasions, whichis basically a textual resource. He has put on the Internet not onlyAvestan but also Pahlavi and various other historical and religioustexts.121‘Parsicommunity’ is largely informative, with contents onmatrimonials, personal announcements, business and address list-ings, shopping and astrology. It has some religious articles, mostly byJehan Daruwalla, the former editor of the Bombay Samachar,whostands on the Liberal wing of the community in India.122Anothermainly factual, Parsi-orientated site is run by Sarosh R. Petigara. Ithas the Gujarati, with English translation, of what has become theParsi anthem, details of Parsi temples and other religious buildingsin India, guidance on what to pray and when. There are a fewdoctrinal articles, of a traditional nature, for example on the naujoteby Pervin Mistry, and one on the symbolism of the Fravahar/Faroharby Dr H. P. B. Neku.123In contrast there is one site which, thoughcarrying some partisan religious views, is primarily dedicated toPersian culture, language, music, art and architecture. This site,run by Feraydoon Demehri out of Vancouver, has some religiousmaterial on it, notably accounts of the main festivals, such as NoRuz (a very helpful item for people wishing to learn about this keyIranian festival). A particular interest of the site, at the time of writ-ing, is its role in encouraging the growth of Iranian music and Gathasongs. It includes items on places in Iran and business directories.It is one of the best-maintained sites.124There are sites for most ofthe Zoroastrian Associations in America and Britain, but thesegenerally are factual records of their work and membership and donot contain a significant amount of religious material.

The site is organized mainlyby Iranian Zoroastrians from northern California. A goodproportion of the articles are by Iranian Zoroastrians; Jafarey’sworks are posted, as too are some by ‘Liberal’ Parsis such as AdiDavar, Jehan Bagli, and Dasturs Dhalla, Bode and Minocher-Homji.

Some sites are particularlyuseful for the range of network links they include.142One of themost frequently accessed sites appears to be the ‘World ofTraditional Zoroastrianism’, which on 1 March 2002 had beenaccessed 177,457 times in its history; ‘Zarathushtra.com’ had116,843 hits over a similar period, whereas ‘parsi.com’ has had‘only’ 42,368. These figures illustrate the extensive use made of theInternet, and highlight the importance of its study. Websites areconsulted more frequently than most books are.Internet debatesMost sites express the point of view of a single group; relativelyfew engage in dialogue or debate with people of opposing views,although they often contain attacks on their opponents. For exam-ple, the Traditional Zoroastrian website contains attacks on whatit calls ‘the liberal-controlled WZO’, but there are no WZOresponses listed.143That website also raised a campaign against asite operated by Sun Microsystems on which Jafarey was quotedby ‘Mehrdad K’ using insulting and offensive language about tra-ditional Zoroastrianism. It persuaded the Internet supplier toclose the site down because of these attacks.144(The site was laterreopened through another Internet supplier.) There have beenoccasions when Zoroastrians have disputed with fellowZoroastrians on the Internet. Contrary views can, for example, befound in ‘Zarathushtra.com’, which has substantial archives ofcorrespondence as far back as 1997. The contributors are mainlyAmerican, but there are messages from people in Australia,Pakistan, the Gulf States, South Africa, Malaysia, and Europe(including Norway, Sweden, Italy and Britain).

Many of these form the focus of debate with the Reformingwing. They are (in brief):1. All our Scriptures are Sacred, including the Gathas, Yashts and theVendidad. We pray all of them in our Fire Temples before the SacredFire, and they have immense spiritual power, their very utterance in thesacred Avestan language serving to further righteousness and fight evil.2. All our fire temples and rituals of the Yasna are sacred and necessaryfor the religion, such as the Nirang-din ceremony...3. Dakhma-nashini is the only method of corpse-destruction of thedead body...4. Marrying, Zarathushtri man or woman, to a Zarathushtri only iscommanded in our religion in the Vendidad, to preserve the spiritualstrength of...the religion, and the ethnic identity of theZarathushtri Aryans.5. . . . there was no ‘conversion’ because the Aryans...were alreadyMazdayasnis when Zarathushtra came...the righteous of everyreligion go to heaven, all religions are equal...6. The observance of the Laws of the Vendidad is an important pillarof the Zarathushtri religion. This includes...menstrual seclusion...The Vendidad also carries strong moral injunctions against the acts ofhomosexuality and prostitution...7. Faith and hope in the coming of the Saoshyant (Saviour)...todefeat evil and further righteousness...[and] the final spiritual bat-tle between the forces of good and evil...The World will be madeperfect again...These tenets set the agenda for the main debates between thevarious Zoroastrian groups.Globalizing Trends641147The latest such exchange I have noted was in October 2001."},{"pageNumber":661,"pageContent":"IntermarriageIntermarriage, and for Parsis the associated idea of conversion,is probably the biggest single issue on most Internet sites.K. N. Dastoor, in an article originally published in Parsi Pukar, listsas the seventh of the key features of the ‘package of Parsi life’:‘A Parsi has to preserve his racial gene and not allow it to be mixedup by marriage outside the fold.’148In what is a long article writ-ten for the Internet, Roni Khan compared the Parsi and Jewishexperiences of intermarriage, and argued that:the Zarathushtrian Marriage Sacraments are not and cannot be,bestowed on Parsi intermarriages—for men and women both [a refuta-tion of the 1906 Bombay High Court Case]. These intermarriages arealways civil, not religious, marriages. The very definition of the term‘civil’ is: lay, secular, temporal, not ecclesiastical. It needs to be emphasisedand understood that Zarathushtrian marriage is a religious sacramentand not just a civil contract.149He argues that in the eyes of the Zoroastrian religion a marriagethat could not be performed under ‘its own marital sacraments’cannot be recognized. He argues that: ‘While the children ofintermarried Parsis should never be demeaned, embarrassed orostracized in any way in any non-religious sphere of life, the line ofnon-acceptance has to be drawn without fear or favour insofar asthe Zarathushtrian Religion is concerned.’ Ervad (Dr) Hoshang J. Bhada offers an esoteric reason against intermarriage. He statesthat all were born into the religion which God deems appropriate,and that everyone has their own ‘internal energies’ which aredeveloped in the womb, and which should not be mixed withpeople of a different religion. Further he argues that Zoroastrianrituals generate vibrations which must only be experienced byZoroastrians.150Globalizing Trends642148Members.oozemail.com.au/~zarathus/pukar33e.html.

He can be harsh in his vocabulary,but mostly his articles on his own website (‘The World ofZoroastrianism’) are measured. For example, in an article on‘Conversion in Mazdayasna’, he writes that although Mazdayasnais a universal religion, its ‘missionary spirit is not the classicalproselytizing style practised by many religions. Instead of prosely-tizing, Mazdayasna seeks to inform. We provide information onMazdayasni belief and practice...we accept all who of theirown free and informed choice, wish to accept Mazdayasna as theirvision of God and their way of life.’151The Parsis and Iranians, heargues, dropped the practice of conversion because of theirrespective historical situations. He expounds some of his coreassumptions in the following words:Zarathushtra’s is a message about a spirituality that progresses towardsself-realization, fulfilment and completeness, as a good creation of atotally good God. It is a message of freedom, freedom to choose, free-dom from fear, freedom from guilt, freedom from sin, freedom fromstultifying rituals, superstitious practices, fake spirituality and ceremoni-als. The God of Zarathushtra, is not a God of ‘Thou shalt’ and ‘Thoushall not’, God in Zoroastrianism does not care what you wear, whatand when you eat or where and when you worship. God instead careshow righteous, progressive and good you are. The Zoroastrian Religionpictures humanity as the growing and evolving creation of a God thatrespects it, and wants it to collaborate in the task of preserving,nourishing, fostering and refreshing this Living World of ours....Mazdayasna...teaches the equality of all mortals before their Wisecreator God; who only sees a difference in righteousness among mortals.Thus there is equality of race, nation, sex and social position.152Globalizing Trends643the Inter-married Association’ by Porus H.

Consequently,the Orthodox and traditional sites invoke the Dasturs, utilize theMiddle Persian texts and the whole Avesta, not least the Vendidadand the purity laws it sets forth.160The sites associated withthe Reforming wing of the religion affirm the authority only of theGathas, and reject the Vendidadfor containing pre-Zoroastrian ideasthat came to corrupt pure Zoroastrian teaching.161Ultimately for Zoroastrians in most groups, the main authorityis Zoroaster, but there are different perceptions of his nature androle. According to the Zarathushtrian Assembly:in the Institutionalized Zoroastrianism Zarathushtra is more ofa reformer than a founder of an ancient Iranian religion which haddeviated from its path. He cleansed the religion of its daeva worship andsuperstition, but perpetuated all the ‘good’ old beliefs and rituals.

In some ways the message of the Congress was encap-sulated in the treatment given to Farhang Mehr, the formerDeputy Prime Minister, under the Shah: a man who had to escapein secret from his country, was officially welcomed and treated asan honoured guest of the nation. Leading mullahs expresslypraised the message of the Prophet Zarathushtra and the contrib-ution of his religion to Iran and to the world. Each of thecongresses provided an opportunity, which was taken, forZoroastrians around the world to gather and debate what wereseen as the key issues of the day. Interaction, dialogue, conflict andplans were the outcome of these various meetings. It is too earlyto say if these resulted in effective action.From the perspective of globalization, the World Congress inHouston had special significance. In part this was because it wasthe first World Congress held outside the two old countries. ManyZoroastrians, especially Americans, saw this as recognition of theimportance of the diaspora, of the global spread, for the future ofthe religion. It was also the largest World Zoroastrian Congress todate, with 2,500 participants turning a large Texan hotel complexinto a Zoroastrian village as people met from around the world.Each congress has, despite its international character, reflected thepriorities of the host country. Indian and Iranian priorities havecharacterized the previous meetings. This one was planned inconsultation with leaders from the old countries, but the majorityof participants, and the overall perspective of the Congress, wassteered mainly by Zoroastrians on the American continent. It wasorganized by the Association in Houston, but held under the ban-ner of FEZANA. Congress officials and the planning groups werestructured to represent the interests of both the local Associationand the national body.Planning problemsThe planning of the Congress sought to give platforms forspeakers from the old countries as well as from the New World.179Dasturs, leading mobeds and prominent teachers were invited. ButGlobalizing Trends651179For an upbeat, yet bland, piece on the planning problems see A. S. Mama, ‘Help usGet the Congress to You’,Parsiana, May 2000, pp. 24 f."},{"pageNumber":671,"pageContent":"the planning was overwhelmed by a debate on whether to inviteAli Jafarey. The local Association, Houston, has been noted forits traditional nature, and many of its members were notinclined to invite him, recognizing neither his teaching as a ‘true’Zoroastrianism, nor himself as ‘a real’ Zoroastrian. To others,however, his teaching is seen as a return to the authentic teachingof the Prophet, free of later priestly superstition and of the ethnicbias alleged to be prominent among traditional Parsis. Initially, theBombay Parsi Punchayet supported his participation, until theywere informed of his work in converting non-Zoroastrians.Leading members of the Zarathushtrian Assembly campaigned onhis behalf. The campaign was conducted mostly on the Internet,and in some confrontational planning meetings. His supportersargued not only that his teaching was true to the message ofZoroaster, but also that non-Zoroastrians had been invited toaddress such congresses before so that even by his opponents’ ownperspective there was no reason to exclude him. Others stressedthat the freedom of speech embodied in the AmericanConstitution required that he should be allowed to speak. Eachside referred to their opponents in vitriolic language. Several plan-ning meetings were dominated by the dispute, with resolutions andcounter-resolutions from various local Associations; New York, forexample, were strong supporters of Jafarey’s right to speak. Thetensions were such that the future of the Congress seemed indoubt. In order to avoid the accusation of excluding Jafareybecause he was not a Zoroastrian, the organizers agreed thatno non-Zoroastrian speakers should be invited, a very unusualstep for Zoroastrian congresses. Discussions about honouring non-Zoroastrians were also dropped to try to avoid the allegation oftreating Jafarey differently.180The compromise eventually reachedwas for FEZANA to host a ‘debate’ during, but ‘apart’ from, theCongress, between Jafarey and the Orthodox KhshnoomistBombay teacher Adi Doctor.181The debate was held in theballroom of the main hotel and was attended by a huge audience.The fear of conflict was such that hotel security staff were much inGlobalizing Trends652180Only two non-Zoroastrians were involved in any way.

McIntyre provides a personal view’."},{"pageNumber":672,"pageContent":"evidence. In fact the debate was conducted in an unantagonisticatmosphere and there was none of the confrontational abusewhich had characterized the earlier disputes.Leaving aside the vitriol, the issue highlighted a key question in the context of discussions on globalization: is Zoroastrianisma religion intimately related to a single racial group or a universalreligion to which anyone can be initiated? Is religion part of aculture that one enters into from birth, a part of one’s ultimateorigin? Or does the religion have a global message and truth fromwhich any person can benefit? This issue affected a range ofcontributions to the Congress. There were three debates on thesubject ‘One Zarathushtra, Many Zarathushtis’, involving adiscussion on whether there should be an acknowledgement ofdifferent Zoroastrian ‘sects’ or denominations, recognizing the dif-ferent beliefs, practices and ties of the Orthodox and Reformingwings. Two of the prominent debaters were Khojeste Mistree andFarhang Mehr, speakers who had clashed strongly many timesbefore. In fact they concurred that they should ‘disagree agreeably’.In a later Internet message Dina McIntyre supported the recogni-tion of such a separation.182The aim, it was emphasized, was toavoid the acrimony, which could drive the youth away from thereligion. The practical problem, inevitably, was who should retainownership of the various properties, Trusts and charities. Despitethis agreement between adversaries, no formal results have mate-rialized from addressing this big question of the global future ofthe ancient religion.Happier notesBut the Congress did not only address one issue. Another themewas the role of the youth in the future of the religion. Runningthrough the Congress was a pathway of meetings organized by,and focusing on, the youth. This combined social and debatingmeetings. Among the former were the seventh Zarathushti Gamesorganized over two days before the Congress. In addition totrack events there were competitions in basketball, volleyball,table tennis, discus, shot-put and swimming. There was also adance specifically for the youth held concurrently with a dance forthe elders to mark the turn of the New Year and the start of theGlobalizing Trends653182www.zoroastrian.net/Dina McIntyre discusses Khojeste Mistree’s call."},{"pageNumber":673,"pageContent":"new millennium. The debates for the youth were less acrimoniousthan some of those of the elders. The purpose was to aid net-working, whether through business, or meetings with people estab-lished in a profession advising those just starting, for example,in medicine. In support of the youth, as well as the elders, aZoroastrian Chamber of Commerce was started.A theme that spanned the generations was the greatness of theZoroastrian heritage. This was celebrated both in exhibitions (ofSasanian coins and Zoroastrian dress down the ages), through avideo presentation on ‘Our Legacy’, and with the launch of thevideoIn the Footsteps of Our Forefathers(discussed in the Introductionto this chapter). An event which has become common in NorthAmerican Zoroastrian Congresses, and at special functions organ-ized by the BPP and WZO in India, was the honouring of somegreat living achievers. The Outstanding World Zarathushti Awardwas made to Prof. Kaikhusroo Irani of New York. MehrabanZartoshty was honoured for his philanthropic work; Dr JamshedIrani for achievements in business; Zubin Mehta for excellence inthe performing arts; Kerman Jasavala from London with a youthaward for outstanding leadership in his work for organizingthe World Youth Congress in Britain. Finally Shahram Akhtar-khavari, an Iranian designer, was honoured for his design of theaward trophy. There were also events celebrating the global unityof the religion. The theme of unity was visually depicted ina ‘Unity quilt’ featuring the logos of Associations worldwide.There was a concert involving the first performance by the ‘WorldZoroastrian Orchestra’.183Finally there was a function to honourwomen’s achievements in the community over the years.The impact of the CongressWhat were the achievements of the Congress? An initial impres-sion from the debates is the aggravation of divisions, particularlythrough the acrimony over Jafarey’s participation. They resultedin the absence of many leading figures, notably Dasturs fromIndia and some of the senior figures in America. There weretimetabled sessions on the future of FEZANA, especially its fund-ing, and the role of the priesthood. Many of the speakers repeatedGlobalizing Trends654183There were two Australian members, four from India and one from Canada, butmost—nineteen—came from USA."},{"pageNumber":674,"pageContent":"positions they had long been associated with. The formation ofa world body to replace WZO proved to be acrimonious, despitethe fact that the leaders of WZO stayed away from the meeting.Old divisions were therefore made visible, and in some cases prob-ably reinforced. However, in comments published in the FEZANAJournalafter the Congress184the view expressed most frequentlywas that the excellent organization behind the event facilitated theinteraction between Zarthushtis from around the world, enablingthem to renew old friendships and make new ones. Another noteof hope was the positive atmosphere in the meetings of the youth.In the long term, the Congress asserted the importance of thediaspora in the future of Zoroastrianism. At the time of writing,it looks likely that the next World Congress will be in Britain,which will reinforce the importance of the global perspective. Itwill have to address the issue of the divisions between the elders,the authority of leaders in India and Iran, and the policies con-cerning the future role of the youth. In short, the congressesenhance the process of globalization.The Global SurveyThe survey thus far has been used to form a picture of thecommunity in each of the diasporic groups studied. Such afocus is important in seeking to construct a history of the variouscommunities. However, these studies alone might suggest thatZoroastrians are simply the products of their local environment.This section will therefore address the big picture of patterns ofsettlement not according to local conditions, but according togeneral trends. Are there global patterns of settlement of differentgroups, e.g. according to level or type of education, according tocountry of birth, patterns that may be found wherever, say,East African Parsis or Iranian Zoroastrians settle? Because the fol-lowing discussions are dividing the global response of 1,840 intojust two or three subgroups, for example, male and female, thenumber involved in each subgroup provides a far larger base forarguments so that percentages became more reliable and strongerassertions are possible.

Myoriginal intention had been to produce a substantial monographjust on the survey and to develop a sophisticated analysis of thedata. I changed my mind and included it as just one section of achapter because I became increasingly conscious of my own limita-tions regarding statistical analysis. To have written a monographanalysing the whole survey would have been to ‘play to my ownweaknesses’. But the data collected is interesting and worth inclu-sion, if for no other reason than that it might challenge others moreappropriately qualified than I am to undertake such a study not justof Zoroastrians but of other diasporic communities also. I find itdifficult to believe that some of the trends and patterns of settle-ment of the various groups discussed in this section, for example,gender and generational issues, the impact of western and highereducation, family structures, are specific only to Zoroastrians.It is important to highlight some of the weaknesses and dangersin what follows. Where the tables compare large groups of a sim-ilar size (for example the comparative study of the 961 male and851 female answers in Table 2), then the data is fairly strong andthe conclusions drawn are reasonably secure. In other tables, how-ever, because of the potential interest of the topic, I have com-pared the responses of a large group with those of a much smallersample. For example, in Table 4 I tested a hypothesis which I haddeveloped as a result of my contacts with Zoroastrians in so manycountries for over thirty years. My hypothesis was that people whohad migrated from urban areas, e.g. Mumbai or Karachi, hadbeen prepared for living in the West by their lifestyle in metropol-itan areas, whereas my impression was that my Zoroastrianfriends who had migrated from more rural backgrounds, such asparts of Gujarat, found life in the West a greater shock and res-isted the pressure to assimilate more vigorously than had thepeople from Bombay/Mumbai. Table 4 supports that hypothesis,Globalizing Trends656185Here and elsewhere in this chapter references to comments in my previous writingsare to three main publications: Hinnells,Zoroastrians in Britain, ch. 6; Hinnells (ed.),The NewPenguin Handbook of Living Religions, 2nd edn., Harmondsworth, 1998, pp. 819–47; Hinnells,Selected Works, pp. 335–430."},{"pageNumber":676,"pageContent":"but comparing a sample group of 769 people with one of only 62is methodologically questionable. A 10% difference within sub-groups of over 700 people reflects a group of 70-plus, whereas10% of 62 persons represents only six people. The conclusions ofsuch a comparison must be viewed with caution. I hope othersmore appropriately qualified than I may find the hypothesis chal-lenging and pursue the question with greater sophistication than I have. To alert the reader to such problems I have indicated insquare brackets [ N\u0002] the precise number of answers to everyquestion by each group. In the tables in Appendix 2, the number[N\u0002] indicates how many respondents fall into a category, so torefer to Table 2 again, 66% of 961 male respondents said thatthey prayed daily, and 74% of the 851 female respondents saidthat they prayed daily. Respondents were told that if they did notlike any question, they should leave it out and press on. As a resultthe number of answers to each question by any one group varied.For example, in almost all groups fewer respondents answeredquestions relating to religious beliefs than answered questions onreligious practices (or on demographic issues). That fact alone isinteresting because it is due, almost certainly, in part to the lesseremphasis given to doctrine among most Zoroastrians than among,say, Protestants. I have drawn attention to the parts of the tableswhere the imbalance of sample sizes requires caution.There are many other aspects of these tables which the special-ist in survey work would question. I have rarely given the figures forthose who answered a question in the negative and have equallyrarely indicated the number of people who answered ‘Don’tKnow’—an option for virtually every question. My thinking wasthat I was interested mostly in the actual responses received. Nordo my tables include details of the mean compared to the average,nor to the standard deviation, which a specialist would haveincluded. It is not only that I am not a statistician, it is also aquestion of space. The very first computer printout of the surveymaterial relating to the following section exceeded 120,000 pages,and I subsequently asked very many more questions of the data.The option was either to give a limited account of the total data,or to give a full account of a small part of the data—or to give thepublisher a book unpublishable on the grounds of size. I took thefirst option. It is my hope that this material will be of interest, andwill challenge, encourage debate and trigger further study.Globalizing Trends657"},{"pageNumber":677,"pageContent":"A ‘shorthand’ is developed in what follows to save repetitionand space. One to be noted is the variable about observingPateti/No Ruz, the gahambars, and keeping a divo(oil lamp) burn-ing in the home. Obviously there were several variations in theanswers to this question. In what follows I have generally summar-ized the answers by referring to ‘All (or none) of the Zoroastriantraditions’. However, with various groups one custom is more sig-nificant than others. For example, to the Iranian Zoroastrians thecelebration of festivals, especially the gahambars, is particularlyimportant and so the answer is broken down accordingly. Becauseof such different priorities of practices and beliefs the tables inAppendix 2 do not always list exactly the same questions,although there is a general consistency in order to facilitate com-parison. Another shorthand has been used relating to attitudestowards funerals. It would not have been clear to have asked ‘Doyou believe in dokhmenashni?’, i.e. funerals involving the exposure ofthe body in a Tower of Silence, or dokhma, because respondentsmight believe in it in principle, but can obviously not practise it inthe diaspora. Respondents were, therefore, asked what sort offuneral they wanted for themselves. Because of the need to avoida repetition of a complex question and answer, I have used theshorthand of ‘a dokhmafuneral’. That is not a Zoroastrian term,but I hope that the shorthand is clear and unambiguous.The brief discussion at the end of Chapter 3 looking at a rangeof ‘litmus tests’ to identify patterns of religious belief and practiceapplies particularly to this section. In what follows the data isstudied under three main headings: the practice of the religion(prayer, wearing sudreandkusti, observing the traditions andattending religious functions); beliefs (intermarriage, the afterlife,whether beliefs and practices have changed); and ethnic ornational ties (citizenship, practice and value of secular/culturaltraditions, such as food, language etc.). In comments on whetheror not respondents held ‘traditional beliefs’ (e.g. the importance ofprayers for the dead), there is no intention of evaluating the truthor otherwise of a belief, but rather of looking for one marker,among others, of the extent to which people have retained theirlinks with what have been long-held traditions.A further qualification is necessary. It does not follow thatbecause most people in a group tended to, say, practise the reli-gion more traditionally, or to have closer ties with the old country,Globalizing Trends658"},{"pageNumber":678,"pageContent":"that all the people in that group did so. It is worth emphasizingthis obvious point, because the use of precise percentage figuresgives an image of complete objectivity which appears to brook nodispute. When below it is said that Parsis from Pakistan tended tobe more traditional in the religious beliefs and practices thanthose from Mumbai, it does not follow that all Parsis from Pakistanwere religious. A danger with surveys such as this is that theycan appear deterministic, giving, for example, the idea that allIranian Zoroastrians have the same beliefs and practices. Myexperience of Zoroastrians is that they are very individualistic;nevertheless it is possible to identify certain trends and patternsand this section is concerned with this process.One final introductory point regarding the survey is the nature ofthe sample. In such a survey there is a danger that respondents willonly be those who are in contact with a centre, people practisingthe religion and a few people who may be seen by community offi-cials as ‘on the margins of Zoroastrian society’. It was pleasing toobtain responses from a number of intermarried people [ N\u0002203];people who rarely attended a Zoroastrian centre [ N\u0002208]; peoplewho did not read Zoroastrian literature [ N\u00021027]; people whorarely corresponded with other Zoroastrians [ N\u0002179]; peoplewho rarely met other Zoroastrians [ N\u000285]; people who rarely ornever prayed [ N\u0002270]; people who said that they did not practisetheir religion [ N\u0002175]; people who rarely or never visited aZoroastrian centre [ N\u0002339]; people who thought it was not worthpreserving the religion [ N\u0002174]. The sample therefore reflected abroad range of people and perspectives.Gender issues (Table 2)There were 961 responses from men and 851 responses fromwomen in the survey, which provide a good foundation for analy-sis (see Table 2 in Appendix 2). Broadly speaking, the womenrecorded a higher proportion of respondents praying daily,186observing all the Zoroastrian traditions; more women than menaffirmed a belief in one or other form of an afterlife; more ofthem believed that the prayers for the dead were essential. WhatGlobalizing Trends659186The fact that fewer women say they always wear sudreandkustiis not necessarilysignificant.

More of them said that they often ate Indianor Iranian food; more of them wore Indian or Iranian dressregularly; more of them identified themselves in terms of theircountry of birth, whereas men tended rather to assert their iden-tity more in terms of the country of residence. More women thanmen wanted to preserve their traditional music, dress, religionand language. Sometimes the percentage differences were small,but the trend was consistent.187The picture is of women beingmore active and more traditional in belief and practice than men.It is, therefore, regrettable that so many books on diasporic com-munities emphasize the role of men.Previous country of residence (Table 3)Studies of Asians in the West commonly assert that the ‘twicemigrant’ East Africans are typically more traditional than Asianswho have migrated directly from India.188, 189Within theZoroastrian community it is commonly said that the IranianZoroastrians have different patterns of beliefs and practices fromParsis. It is often assumed that people who migrated from onewestern country to another are more likely to be secular.Appendix 2, Table 3 compares the figures for beliefs and practicesof these various ‘national’ origins.190Globalizing Trends660187The substantial difference in the wearing of traditional dress (men 14%, women27%) is perhaps less significant. Even in India, for example, men commonly wear westerndress, whereas women commonly wear saris.188In virtually all cases ‘previous country of residence’ indicates the place of birth. Butthere has been significant onward migration, for example, from Britain to North America.Some of the people who migrated westwards from East Africa had been born in India orPakistan, but appear in this section under East Africa, their last place of residence.189The typical ‘traditional’ or ‘Orthodox’ orientation of the East African Asians is nowwidely accepted by scholars. The person who pioneered this understanding was P. Bhachu,Twice Migrants: East African Sikh Settlers in Britain, London, 1985.190The respondents included nineteen individuals who had moved to a western countryfrom Hong Kong, but to include a percentage in the main text for such a small numberwould have created an impression of greater reliability for those percentages than wouldhave been warranted. A general pattern is noted here for information, but the percentages,and therefore the conclusion, should be treated with caution, although the patterns reflectthe features of the Hong Kong community discussed in Ch. 3. The features for which thediasporic Hong Kongese were noteworthy were that relatively few (15%, in so far as a percentage is acceptable) would permit non-Zoroastrians into a western prayer room.A relatively high proportion believed in an immortal soul (68%) and few in reincarnation(31%).

It is to be expected thatfewer diaspora Iranians wore the sudreandkustiregularly becausethese religious items of dress have not been such a central part ofIranian practice, but, again, more people from East Africa and thesubcontinent rather than ‘westerners’ wore them regularly.The figures for the ‘Zoroastrian traditions’ are slightly morecomplicated. Many more people from East Africa than from anyother group observed all these traditions. Only a minority of anygroup observed none of them, and hardly any of the EastAfricans or Iranians said that they observed none of the traditions.More Iranians than any other group said that they observed thevarious festivals.In terms of the ‘traditional’ range of attitudes, fewer EastAfricans or Iranians wanted a funeral at a dokhma, which is notsurprising since such practices are not part of the tradition oftheir previous country. It was those from India who most com-monly asserted their desire for a dokhmafuneral. More of the‘westerners’ and people from India were accepting of inter-marriage, whereas fewer among the two groups from Muslimcountries, Iranians and Pakistani Zoroastrians, accepted inter-marriage. Those from East Africa tended to be stricter. Butdespite their objection to intermarriage, more IranianZoroastrians than any other group would have allowed non-Zoroastrians in the prayer rooms, whereas fewer East Africansthan any other group are willing to allow juddinsto enter.

Fewer Hong Kongese than any other groupthought language and religion worth preserving (37 and 74% respectively); although theywere positive about Parsi communal relations, they tended to be cautious at saying theirrelations with other groups were good.

Affirmations ina belief in the afterlife, and that prayers for the dead were essen-tial, were fairly high among those from India. It was among theIranians and the ‘westerners’ that more people asserted thehumanistic interpretation that prayers for the dead benefit the liv-ing rather than the dead. There was little difference between thevarious groups in the small proportion who accepted the religiousauthority of ‘the old country’, though a smaller proportion ofIranians than Indians turned to the old country for guidance. Thefigures for attending religious functions were surprising for thosein contact with the various communities at the turn of the millen-nium. But when this survey was undertaken, in the mid-1980s, thehighest proportion of respondents saying that they attended suchfunctions was Iranians. At this time also, the East Africans werestill not as fully integrated into many Associations as they were atthe end of the millennium. These two sets of figures may notreflect later patterns. More Iranians than any other groupsaid that their religious beliefs and practices had not changedGlobalizing Trends662191If the figures for respondents of British origin are separated from those who hadmoved on from another western country, for example from Canada to Australia (N\u0002104and 45 respectively), the former British respondents are far less inclined than the other‘westerners’ to allow non-Zoroastrians into the prayer room (35% and 50% respectively).There are other indicators of the ‘ex-British’ being more traditional, for example, more ofthem believe in an immortal soul (58% and 46% respectively). There are also differencesin national and cultural links. Fewer ex-British think their beliefs have changed much (18%and 26% respectively), but more think that their practices have changed a lot (32% and18% respectively). The explanation for this may be that in London the facilities ofZoroastrian House are more established than they are in American or AustralianAssociations, so that after moving on they were conscious of not being able to maintain thetraditions they had in London. The ex-British are less inclined to assert their identity interms of the country of birth (21% and 35% respectively), and more of them assert theircitizenship in terms of the country of residence (36% and 31%), or in terms of theirZoroastrianness (49% and 39%). More ex-British Zoroastrians assert that relationsbetween Iranians and Parsis are good (35% and 24%), presumably because such tensionshave never been as great in Britain as in much of America.

More people from India than fromanywhere else said that their beliefs and practices had changedconsiderably. These figures reinforce a point made earlier, thatpeople who felt compelled to migrate, and consequently have asense of not wanting to be where they are, resisted assimilationmore than those who had chosen to migrate for their own self-perceived benefit.Ethnic tiesA range of questions addressed issues of respondents’ ethnic/national ties. Substantially more Iranians than any other groupasserted their identity in terms of the country of birth. In contrast,groups from countries where there had been a sense of distance oralienation from the wider population in the old country, EastAfrica and Pakistan, asserted their identity in terms of the coun-try of residence. The Iranians and the East Africans in particularasserted the Zoroastrian-ness of their identity (this issue will bediscussed further below). The great majority of all groups ateIndian or Iranian food often. Perhaps studies of Asian diasporasshould study food more thoroughly.192Again, it was the EastAfricans and the Iranians, even more than others, who valued thispart of their heritage. Overall, the great majority of all groupssaid that the religion, the traditional language (especially theIranians), and food should be preserved. More than any othergroup the Iranians wanted to preserve their traditional music andart. This is understandable as Indian art and music has fewercultural ties for Zoroastrians on the subcontinent, but it is alsoa marker of the particularly strong ties that Iranians feel for theheritage and the ties to the homeland of the religion. The pointsmade by Naficy discussed in Chapter 1 above are as appropriatefor Iranian Zoroastrians as for the other Iranian groups whichhe studied in Los Angeles. As far as relations in the diasporacommunities are concerned, only one in three respondents in allgroups thought that relations between Iranians and Parsis weregood. Apart from the Iranians, two-thirds of most other groupsGlobalizing Trends663192There are a number of Parsi recipe books. The one I find helpful, because ofits section on associated customs, is Bhicoo J. Manekshaw,Parsi Food and Customs,Penguin India, 1996.

Respondentswho had migrated from Pakistan tended to have the most positiveview of diaspora relations, but fewer East Africans than any othergroup thought that relations between old and new migrants weregood, an indicator of their marginalization in the 1980s. A longi-tudinal study of these groups in the new millennium would bevery interesting.Reflections on the ‘national’ trendsThe broad picture is that in terms of beliefs, e.g. life after death,those who most commonly asserted their traditions were thePakistani Zoroastrians, followed by people from India. Parsis fromPakistan, more than any other group, asserted traditional beliefsregarding funerals, intermarriage, in excluding non-Zoroastriansfrom prayer rooms, practising the traditional rites associated withprayer, the wearing ofsudreandkusti, festivals and lighting thedivo. They were less inclined than others to preserve some of thesecular ethnic traditions, for example music and art. Their links totheir land of birth, for example in affirmation of citizenship, werenot as strong as their ties to their new country of residence. Theexplanation seems clear. In Chapter 5 on Pakistan it was notedthat the prominence given to Islam in the wider society affectedthe priority given to religion by the Zoroastrians and the compar-atively high level of religious education there in comparison withParsis in Bombay. Although loyal to the nation while living there,in accord with Zoroastrian tradition, Parsis from Pakistan never-theless do not have such strong links to their country of birth asdo Iranian Zoroastrians.The East African Parsis were traditional in terms of practicessuch as prayer, wearing sudreandkusti, observing festivals, andlighting a divo. In particular they were strong on the preservationof community boundaries, expressed for example in their viewson intermarriage and excluding non-Zoroastrians from westernprayer rooms. They were also strong on some ethnic traditions(food, language, music and art), but not on the importance ofadokhmafor funerals, and they affirmed citizenship expressed interms of their current country of residence. These features areunderstandable after their experience in East Africa, where com-munity boundaries were strong, there was no dokhma; people whohad lived for some time in East Africa had their ties to India orGlobalizing Trends664"},{"pageNumber":684,"pageContent":"Pakistan weakened, and their ties to East Africa were not strong.At the time of the survey, the East Africans were somewhatdistanced from the wider Zoroastrian community, and so theyattended a centre less often. A survey taken in the third millen-nium may be expected to show different features.The Iranians were the group with the strongest ties to theculture of their old country, specifically in the preservation oflanguage, music and art. They were the strongest in asserting theiridentity in terms of the country of birth rather than in terms ofcountry of residence, or they asserted their Zoroastrian-ness.They tended less than most groups to affirm traditional beliefssuch as the importance of prayers for the dead. Because they sawthemselves as marginalized by Parsis in the 1980s, fewer of themattended a Zoroastrian centre than did Parsis from India orPakistan. (This has changed since the survey, particularly inCalifornia, where Iranian Zoroastrians have built two centres, onein Anaheim and one near San José.) Their religious practices,notably the festivals, were associated with group identity ratherthan with personal practice, such as prayer. Although they weremore willing than other groups to allow non-Zoroastrians intoprayer rooms, they were more opposed to intermarriage thanany other groups. The implication is that their priority is topreserve their ethnicity but they were less opposed than any othergroup to non-Zoroastrians participating in their religious andsocial events.Parsis from India were more orientated towards the old countrythan people from Pakistan or East Africa, and attended Zoroastrianfunctions more often than the other Parsi groups. They werealso more inclined to accept intermarriage. In terms of religiousbeliefs they accepted more of the traditional doctrines than peoplefrom East Africa did, but not as many as Parsis from Pakistan. Incommunity discussions I have often heard it said that the Indian-born Parsis are more religious and Orthodox than others are, butthat is not born out by this study. Based on the purely anecdotalevidence of my experience, I suspect that the Bombay Parsis wouldbe more polarized than other groups on their attitude to prayer,the urbanized and westernized individuals believing in a moreProtestantized religion (emphasizing the meaning of prayers andrituals) whereas others followed the traditional Indian acceptance ofthe miraculous and mantric power of prayer.Globalizing Trends665"},{"pageNumber":685,"pageContent":"Turning to the ‘twice (or thrice) migrant’ westerners (i.e. thosewho have migrated from one western country to another), fewerof them in comparison with the other groups practised the reli-gion, fewer of them said that they prayed daily or wore the sudreandkusti. Fewer of them, in comparison with other groups migrat-ing from non-western countries, observed any of the Zoroastriantraditions and more of them expressed non-traditional views onintermarriage and on allowing non-Zoroastrians into westernprayer rooms. Fewer of these western migrants affirmed a beliefin an afterlife, or the importance of the prayers for the dead,except in the humanistic form of providing help for the living.Fewer of these ‘westerners’ than members of other groupsasserted their Zoroastrian-ness, ate Indian or Iranian food orwore Indian or Iranian dress regularly. Fewer of them wantedto preserve the religion or the traditional language. The implica-tion of these figures is that onward migration in the west-ern world appears to be linked to a weakening of religious andethnic ties.In short, whatever the local diasporic conditions of race andimmigration law and policy, the various ‘national’ groups bringwith them their own distinctive qualities, ideals and practices. TheZoroastrian diaspora is not a uniform, monolithic whole butembraces a range of traditions derived, at least in part, fromdiverse geographical backgrounds. The East African Parsis arevery conscious of community boundaries; Parsis from Pakistanare typically strong in religious belief and practice. Both groupstypically identify with the new country more than other groups.The Iranian Zoroastrians are very conscious of their Iranian cul-ture, their links with other Iranians at festivals, and their centres.People from India have strong ties with the old country, butare less traditional in their religion than Parsis from Pakistan.People who move from one western country to another tend tobe the ones most distanced from their religious and culturalheritage.Rural versus urban origins (Table 4)In previous publications I have speculated that there may bedifferent patterns of settlement between people who migrated tothe West from rural and from urban areas. Appendix 2, Table 4compares the responses to religious questions of respondents fromGlobalizing Trends666"},{"pageNumber":686,"pageContent":"Gujarat with those from Bombay. The caution expressed abovemust be registered again, concerning the imbalance of the samplesize of these two groups, with only sixty-seven responses frompeople from Gujarat. The samples from Iran and Pakistan wereyet smaller and made a comparison of such subgroups impossible,but it is reasonable to suppose that if a rural–urban comparison isvalid for migrants from rural versus urban India, it may also betrue of migrants from these other countries. Table 4 shows thatthe level of religious practice was greater among the diasporaZoroastrians who came from Gujarat than it was among peoplewho came from Bombay. More ‘Gujaratis’ prayed daily, wore thesudreandkustiall the time; more of them in the diaspora ateIndian food and wore Indian dress regularly. In terms of belief,more of them wanted a traditional dokhmafuneral, and more ofthem objected to intermarriage and to the presence of non-Zoroastrians in western prayer rooms. More Gujaratis affirmed abelief in an afterlife, the immortality of the soul, reincarnation,heaven and hell, and the importance of prayers for the dead.More of them often attended a Zoroastrian centre in the diaspora,than did the ‘Bombayites’. More Gujaratis looked to India’spriestly authorities, and more of them asserted their identity interms of the country of their birth rather than the country inwhich they now resided. More of them had positive perceptions ofdiaspora Parsi relations. If the disparity of sample sizes permitsany conclusion from this table, the implication seems to be clear,that life in the great cosmopolitan metropolis of Bombay startsa process of westernization which results in diaspora Parsisfrom Bombay assimilating more readily than do those who comefrom more rural backgrounds. It might be hypothesized thatbecause (semi-) rural migrants find western urban life such ashock, they assert their identity and community boundaries morestrongly.Language and religion (Table 5)Language is obviously a key factor in the pattern of religiousbeliefs and practices in the diaspora. If this research were to bereplicated, this subject would merit greater attention than I gaveit. It is difficult to untangle a complex web of factors. The ques-tionnaire asked what people described as their mother tongue.But when I followed up this question during my fieldwork it wasGlobalizing Trends667"},{"pageNumber":687,"pageContent":"clear that ‘mother tongue’ meant different things to differentpeople—either the language of the old country, which they maynot know well, or the language that they most commonly use.There was a clear picture as far as Iranians are concerned: thePersian language meant a great deal to all my respondents fromthis group. The picture is more complicated with Parsis. In con-versation I have asked people what language they thought in, butthat clearly depends on the subject. Gujarati, for example, may beused when talking about family matters; English when discussing,say, world affairs. I once asked an informant, if he dropped abrick on his big toe, what language would he swear in; to whichcame the answer, ‘It depends on who was in the room!’ Parsiscommonly switch from Gujarati to English, or the reverse, in mid-sentence. The most useful way of seeking the information thatI wanted was to ask which language people could read other thanEnglish, for it is clear that many people speak but do not read orwrite in Gujarati. All the Associations studied keep their records,policy statements, conduct business, etc. in English. Identifyingwhich language people conducted their personal affairs in, and inwhich they wrote down their thoughts, seemed a reasonableindicator of the extent to which diaspora Zoroastrians have assim-ilated, and the extent to which they remained in close touch withtheir roots. This point could be exaggerated, because even amongParsis in Mumbai, English is common in conversation and is thelanguage for most formal documents and books. In (rural) Gujarat,the normal language of communication is Gujarati, hence the linkbetween this topic and the previous one. It also reaffirms some ofthe points made above about Iranian Zoroastrians.Table 5 in Appendix 2 summarizes the findings on this topic.Many of the respondents were able to read in a mixture of lan-guages, e.g. other European languages. Because the combinationswere many, this table identified only those who could read inGujarati or Persian, and the third column is for those who read inno language other than English. More Gujarati readers said theyprayed daily than did English readers, and still fewer Persianreaders said that they prayed daily. More Gujarati readers said theywore the sudreandkustiat all times, than did the English readers.Since the sudreandkustiis not such a central part of traditionalIranian practice, the smaller number there was to be expected.Fewer English readers observed the Zoroastrian traditions associatedGlobalizing Trends668"},{"pageNumber":688,"pageContent":"with festivals and the divo, compared with the Gujarati readers,more of whom practised all of them. The Iranians most com-monly observed the festivals, especially No Ruz and the gahambars.As Naficy noted regarding Iranians in California, the festivals, asthe markers of the annual cycle in the old country, assume con-siderable importance for these exiles. As far as funerals are con-cerned, Gujarati readers tended to prefer a dokhmafuneral,whereas English readers preferred cremation. More Iraniansopted for burial, which in view of general practice in Islamic Iranis understandable. More English readers accepted intermarrieds,but the Iranians had similar patterns of response to the Gujaratireaders for reasons discussed above. More of the Gujarati readersthan any other group asserted a belief in one or other form of theafterlife. This was naturally particularly marked in the belief inreincarnation: a belief associated more with India than Iran.But more of the Gujarati readers also affirmed the importance ofprayers for the dead. They were also more likely to accept thereligious authority of the old country. There was relatively littledifference between the groups in their perception of the extent towhich they had changed their beliefs in the new country, but moreIranians than the other groups said that their practices hadchanged little. In all groups, the majority asserted their identityin terms of being Zoroastrian, but the ‘English readers’ assertedtheir identity in terms of the country of residence. There weredifferent priorities for the three groups regarding what meritspreservation. A substantial majority in all groups, especially theGujarati readers, affirmed that the religion is worth keeping, butmany more Iranians than the other groups wanted to preserve themusic, art and language of the old country. Although Parsis com-monly have strong emotional links with India, the ties of diasporicIranians to the old country are immensely strong, as they considerthemselves to be the true Iranians. Feeling compelled to leave theirhomeland, they have particularly strong emotional ties to it. MoreIranian Zoroastrians affirmed that they experienced racial dis-crimination than did the others. These figures may havebeen affected by the suspicion faced by many Iranians after theRevolution and the siege of the American Embassy in Tehran,since most of my Iranian respondents were in America and thissubject was fresh in people’s memory at the time of the survey inthe 1980s.Globalizing Trends669"},{"pageNumber":689,"pageContent":"Place of primary education (Table 6)In some senses, where a person is born may not be the determi-native factor: for example, a family might move a few days after ababy’s birth. A saying commonly attributed to Jesuit teachers is‘Give us a child until he is seven, and he is ours for life.’ It there-fore seemed important to compare not just the last location beforemigration, but where people had their primary education. Table 6in the Appendix 2 summarizes the survey data comparing pat-terns of religion between those whose earliest formal educationwas in a non-western country (India, Pakistan or Iran) and theWest. It is again important to note the difference in sample sizes[N\u00021588 and 132], but a sample of 132 is reasonably large asa basis for cautious judgment. There is a consistent pattern ofthose who had their primary education in ‘the non-western world’practising and affirming Zoroastrian beliefs more than do thosewhose primary education was in the West. More of them prayeddaily and wore sudreandkusti. Fewer of them observed none of thefestivals; more of them observed them all and lit a divo. More ofthem affirmed traditional views on intermarriage and the place of non-Zoroastrians in western prayer rooms. Consistently more ofthose who had their early education in a non-western countryaffirmed a belief in the various forms of an afterlife, and regardedprayers for the dead to be essential. More of the western-educatedasserted the humanistic belief that the prayers for the dead bene-fit the living. More of them than their western-educatedco-religionists affirmed that these prayers aided the dead ratherthan the living. More of them said that they often ate Indian orIranian food and many more of them said that they always woresudreandkusti. More of them attended religious functions in thediaspora than did their western-educated fellows, and more ofthem thought that the religion was worth preserving. However, itwas the western-educated who most commonly asserted that theywished to preserve the secular dimensions of their culture—food,music, dress and art. Those who had their education in ‘the oldworld’ consistently affirmed that community relations were good.The evidence suggests that the location of early education is animportant factor in the preservation specifically of the religiousheritage, but not necessarily of secular ethnicity. This distinctionbetween preserving the religious and the secular dimensions ofethnicity will reoccur below.Globalizing Trends670"},{"pageNumber":690,"pageContent":"Religious education in childhood (Table 7)In most countries studied in this book there was a commonemphasis on the importance of religious classes being organizedfor the young, to equip them to withstand the pressures of the out-side world.

Thisdata deliberately does not distinguish between those who had suchclasses in the old country, but simply between those who did anddid not have such religious education, wherever they had it. In thistable the numbers are sufficiently large for the conclusions to bedrawn with confidence [ N\u0002734 and 1077]. The percentagedifferences are not as great between the two groups as they are inTable 6 discussed above; nevertheless there was a clear and con-sistent pattern that those who had had religious education classespractised their religion more often than those who did not.

There was,Globalizing Trends671193Because the percentage gap between the two groups is less than in the previous table,some of the following details include the two extreme possible answers, e.g. pray dailyand never pray, to verify that the small difference does not mask a number of in-betweenpositions, such as praying occasionally."},{"pageNumber":691,"pageContent":"therefore, a clear pattern of more of those who had a Zoroastrianreligious education in childhood practising the religion, and main-taining traditional beliefs, in comparison with those who did nothave such classes. In the earlier chapters it was commonly seenthat Associations had difficulties in organizing ‘Sunday’ schoolsbecause of pressures of time and distance, but the impact of suchclasses is evident. It is, perhaps, not surprising that religious classeshave no impact on the preservation of people’s ‘secular ethnicity’;the differences in percentages relating to food, music and artare too similar to justify a strong statement, but what differencethere was suggests that those who had religious classes attributedfractionally less importance to food, music, dress and art.Level of education (Table 8)In previous publications I have alluded to different patterns ofreligion according to the level of education pursued. Table 8 inAppendix 2 summarizes the comparative figures for those whocompleted their education at school level and those who pursuedpostgraduate studies. Again both sample groups were sufficientlylarge in number and there was not too great a contrast, so thatconfidence can be placed in the conclusions [ N\u0002341 and 539].There was a general pattern of those who had pursued the high-est level of education practising the religion less than those whohad not proceeded beyond schooling. More of the school-leaverssaid that they prayed daily and always wore the sudreandkusti.More of them observed all the Zoroastrian traditions, and fewerof them observed none. Generally, more of those who completedtheir education at school affirmed belief in an afterlife, thoughmore of the highly educated asserted a general belief in animmortal soul. Fewer of the highly educated believed in theprayers for the dead being essential, and more of them assertedthe ‘humanist’ view that such prayers aid the living rather than thedead. It was the school-leavers who tended to affirm the tradi-tional beliefs exemplified in the wish for a dokhmafuneral, in thenon-acceptance of intermarriage, and on the exclusion of non-Zoroastrians from western prayer rooms. It was the school-leaverswho most commonly attended their local centre for religious func-tions, and more of them accepted the religious authorities in the‘old country’. In the light of these patterns it is not surprising thatit was the highly educated who most commonly said that they hadGlobalizing Trends672"},{"pageNumber":692,"pageContent":"changed their religious beliefs and practices in the new country.The patterns of ‘secular ethnic practices’ were more complex. Itwas the school-leavers who most commonly said that they woreIndian or Iranian dress. There was little difference betweenthe groups on the value of preserving religion and language, butit was the highly educated who wished to preserve some of the non-religious culture of the old country, notably food and art.Although fewer of the very highly educated affirmed religiousbeliefs and practices, it does not follow that they have weaker com-munity ties: they attended functions and valued secular culture,apart from dress, more than the less highly educated. In view ofthe high proportions of highly educated people in the Zoroastriandiaspora, the link between a higher education and weakening oftraditional religious belief and practices could be significant forthe future of the diaspora groups.Type of education (Table 9)In the study of the various countries, it was noted that some typesof graduates tended to migrate to certain countries rather thanothers; for example, arts graduates had commonly migrated toBritain and Canada whereas science graduates tended to migrateto the USA. Appendix 2, Table 9 compares the patterns of beliefsand practices of such graduates. Once more the samples werelarge and balanced enough for there to be reasonable confidencein the assertions [ N\u0002arts 562, sciences 508; 770 responses said‘other’, including 292 saying a mixture.] Although the figures didnot differ widely, there was nevertheless a fairly common patternthat arts graduates tended to practise the religion and preservedthe traditional beliefs more than the scientists did. More artsgraduates said that they prayed daily than did the scientists,though there was little difference on the wearing of the sudraandkusti. Arts graduates tended to have more traditional views onexcluding non-Zoroastrians from western prayer rooms and pre-ferred a dokhmafuneral. More of them asserted a belief in variousforms of the afterlife, and more arts graduates believed that theprayers for the dead were essential and benefited the dead,whereas more scientists believed that they benefited the living.Slightly more arts than science graduates accepted that religiousauthority lay in the old country. The scientists tended to affirmmore than the arts graduates that their beliefs and practices hadGlobalizing Trends673"},{"pageNumber":693,"pageContent":"changed in the new country, and more of them asserted thecitizenship of their country of residence rather than the countryof their birth. More arts than science graduates believed that thereligion and the old language were worth preserving, but theirviews were not so different on the secular dimensions of ethnicity.In short, as with the level of education, so also the nature of thateducation affected religious belief and practice and perceptions ofchange in the western world.Type of career (Table 10)In previous publications I have tentatively advanced the hypothesisthat there are different patterns of religious belief and practicebetween businessmen and people in the professions (law, medicine,academia etc.). Table 10 summarizes the data on religion for thetwo groups. Once more the sample sizes are large and balancedenough for confidence to be placed in the conclusions drawn fromthe data [N\u0002business persons 362; professionals 573]. Typically,more of the businessmen, in comparison with the professionals,said that they prayed daily and more of them asserted a belief inan afterlife. More of them thought that prayers for the dead wereessential and that the prayers benefited the dead, whereas the pro-fessionals tended to assert the ‘humanist’ belief that they benefitedthe living. More businessmen accepted the authority of the priestsin the old country; more of them asserted traditional views onsuch issues as a dokhmafuneral, more objected to intermarriageand more of them wanted to exclude non-Zoroastrians fromwestern prayer rooms. More businessmen than professionalsasserted that they had not changed their religious beliefs or prac-tices in the West, and more of them asserted their citizenship interms of the place of birth rather than in terms of residence.Fewer of them, surprisingly in the light of the above trends,asserted their identity in terms of their Zoroastrian-ness. It was,on the other hand, the professionals who tended to say that thesecular ethnic traditions (food, music, dress and art) were worthpreserving. The anecdotal evidence gained from my various peri-ods of fieldwork was that the businessmen tended to want to geton with ‘doing’ their religion, whereas the highly educated profes-sionals wanted to think about, and debate, beliefs and practices.These findings support that subjective impression, and are pro-bably affected by the trend noted above on the impact of higherGlobalizing Trends674"},{"pageNumber":694,"pageContent":"levels of education. Many Zoroastrian businessmen are graduates,but fewer of them, in comparison with the professionals, haveundertaken postgraduate study. As with the highly educated andthe scientists, fewer traditional beliefs and practices do not neces-sarily mean a loss of interest in their cultural heritage, for theprofessionals valued their secular ethnicity even more than thebusinessmen did. Preserving Parsi-panucan be strong even if peopleare not religious, just as being Iranian matters to non-religiousIranian Zoroastrians.Period of migration (Table 11)In previous publications I have suggested that there are broaddifferences between the patterns of belief and practice betweenZoroastrians who have migrated in the different decades. Table 11summarizes the figures behind that assertion and details the[N\u0002] N figures. It should be noted that there were only 67 respon-dents who had migrated prior to the 1950s compared with 669who had migrated in the 1970s. Caution needs to be exercised incomparing the percentages, but the pre-1950 arrivals were suchan interesting group, given that globally migration was a featureof the 1960s and later, that it was judged worth keeping the pre-1960s figures separate. In what follows, by early settlers I refer tothose who migrated before the 1960s (i.e. conflating the pre-1950swith pre-1960s so that N\u0002179 therefore gives greater confidencein the comparisons); the middle period indicates the 1960s and1970s when most respondents migrated; the later settlers werethose who had migrated in the 1980s. The pattern is notabsolutely consistent, but in general terms, the earliest and thelatest settlers tended to practise the religion more, and affirmedmore traditional beliefs. For example, fewer migrants of the‘middle period’, the1960s and 1970s, said that they prayed daily,wore the sudre/kustidaily; nor did so many of them say that theypreferred a dokhmafuneral. Fewer ‘middle period’ settlers raisedobjections to intermarriage and fewer of them would bar non-Zoroastrians from the western prayer rooms. The reason appearsto be that the earliest settlers now form the older generation, andpatterns associated with age will be discussed below. The peoplewho migrated in the 1960s and 1970s were the pioneers, peoplewho were highly educated, very positive about the New World,the innovative trailblazers. The latest arrivals are people who stillGlobalizing Trends675"},{"pageNumber":695,"pageContent":"remain close to the old countries, and their ties are both emotionaland religious. It is this group that tended to assert that they hadnot changed their religious beliefs or practices very much, in con-trast to the settlers in the ‘middle period’. The new settlers morecommonly affirmed that religion and language were worth pre-serving, and ate Indian or Iranian food often, and attended aZoroastrian centre for religious functions more frequently. Therewas little difference between the groups regarding other seculardimensions of their ethnicity, namely food, music and art. It wasthe earliest and the latest settlers who identified themselves as cit-izens of the country of birth, whereas the ‘middle period’ settlersidentified themselves as citizens of the country of residence. Thelatest settlers were those most likely to assert their Zoroastrianness.There were other exceptions to this general pattern which werereadily explicable. Fewer of the early settlers said they attendedreligious functions often, presumably because of decreasingmobility as they grew older. Conversely, it is probably because oftheir age that more of them believed that prayers for the deadwere essential, and age was probably the explanation for the ear-lier settlers wearing the sudreandkustimost. In view of these com-ments it is important to compare the patterns of religious beliefand practice associated with age.Age groups (Table 12)In many societies the received wisdom is that young people areless religious than older people are. That pattern did emerge inthis study, but, as will be seen, the picture is more complex than asimple graph. The general picture (Appendix 2, Table 12) is thatbetween the ages of 20 and 60 people tended to be less religiousthan those over 60 were. The subject of the under-20s will be dis-cussed at the end of this section. More older people said that theyprayed daily and wore the sudreandkustiregularly. Fewer of themsaid that they observed none of the Zoroastrian traditions andmore observed all of them in comparison with younger people.More older people preferred a dokhmafuneral in comparisonwith the middle-aged. Fewer old people approved of intermar-riage, but more youngsters said that they wished to excludenon- Zoroastrians from the western prayer rooms. More of theolder people affirmed a belief in the afterlife, and asserted thatprayers for the dead were essential. More youngsters, rather thanGlobalizing Trends676"},{"pageNumber":696,"pageContent":"the elders, considered that these prayers aid the living. Moreelders asserted their identity in terms of the country of residence,rather than of birth; it was the youngsters who asserted theirZoroastrian-ness. It was mostly the young and middle-aged whowanted to preserve the secular ethnic traditions, namely food, artand even language. Not surprisingly, perhaps, it was mostly theelders who asserted that the religion was worth preserving. Theelders, rather than the young people, were consistently morepositive about community relations, be that between Iranians andParsis, or between Parsis, or between old and new immigrants.Given the comments in the previous chapters that the youngstersfound the battles of their elders put them off the community, thesefigures are striking confirmation of that anecdotal evidence. Thebroad point, therefore, is that the level of religious belief washigher among the older members of the community, the over-60s,and particularly those aged 70 and over.The figures for the under-20s merit further comment. Althoughfewer affirmed religious belief and practice less than their eldersdid, it is worth noting how many of them still asserted theirreligious belief and practice, more than might be expected froma survey of the wider population of that age. Over half of theyounger respondents said that they prayed daily and wore the sudreandkustiregularly. As many youngsters said that they celebratedthe festivals as did those in any other age group. The same wastrue for accepting the authority of bodies in the old country.There were some areas where the young were stricter than theirelders, notably in their wish for a traditional dokhmafuneral, andmore of them wanted to exclude non-Zoroastrians from theirprayer rooms. As related in Chapter 8 on North America, theywanted a place to go where they could be themselves. It is alsoworth drawing attention to the fact that it was the youngsters inparticular who wanted to assert their identity in terms of theirZoroastrian-ness. It would, therefore, be simplistic to assert thatthe youngsters who responded to this survey were less religiousthan their elders were. There was a substantial amount of reli-gious belief and practice, and a degree of traditionalism, amongthem. More of them than the elders were keen to preserve suchsecular traditions as food and language. This table is further evid-ence of the error common in the 1960s’ assumption that migrantcommunities would follow a steady trajectory of assimilation.Globalizing Trends677"},{"pageNumber":697,"pageContent":"Perhaps the age at which the figures suggest a lower level of beliefand practice is the twenties. The reason for this may be somethingto do with family patterns.Family patterns (Table 13)There was a general pattern for more of the married, and espe-cially the widowed, people practising the religion, and for more ofthem to affirm religious beliefs than did single, or separated anddivorced persons (Appendix 2, Table 13). A larger percentage ofwidowed persons, and to a lesser but still important extent, more ofthe married persons said that they prayed daily, wore the sudreandkustiregularly, ate Indian or Iranian food, and wore the dress of theold country, than did people in the two other groups. It is notice-able that in most instances the figures for the separated or divorcedpeople were very similar to those for the single, never (yet) marriedpersons. More married and widowed persons took traditionalviews on religious questions; for example, fewer of them acceptedintermarriage, and the widowed especially affirmed the import-ance of prayers for the dead. These are the two groups who mostcommonly said that they attended Zoroastrian centres regularly forreligious functions. More of them also observed all of the tradi-tions than did the single or separated or divorced people.Contrasting attitudes to citizenship will be discussed below in thestudy of Table 23. Fewer single people asserted that the religionwas worth preserving. The exceptions to this general pattern arethat the single people were more traditional regarding funerals,which is not what one might have expected. It may be becausea high proportion of single people were young, and this was seento be a way in which young people were more traditional thanmany of their elders. There was relatively little difference betweenthe groups on excluding non-Zoroastrians from the prayer rooms.Single and divorced people tended to be more negative in theirassessment of community relations. Married life, therefore,appears to be associated with people becoming more identifiedwith their traditions. But there are, of course, different types offamily, and the following sections will consider these.Nuclear and extended families (Table 14)My subjective impression, based on staying with both nuclearand extended families, was that the presence of a wider family,Globalizing Trends678"},{"pageNumber":698,"pageContent":"especially with the older generation of the grandparents, commonlyresulted in a more traditional religious practice. The figures inAppendix 2, Table 14 compare nuclear and extended families.More members of nuclear families said that they prayed daily, andslightly more of them always wore sudreandkusti. Slightly more ofthe members of nuclear families said that they wanted a tradi-tionaldokhmafuneral and in general more of them expressed abelief in one or other forms of a belief in the afterlife. There wereonly minimal differences on attitudes to prayers for the dead.More members of extended families said that their beliefs andpractices had changed after migration. Members of extendedfamilies tended to assert their identity either in terms of the country of their birth, or as Zoroastrians, whereas more nuclearfamilies asserted their citizenship of the country of residence.Consistently, members of nuclear families thought it was worthpreserving both the religion and the secular aspects of their inher-itance (music, dress, art and language). These figures do not,therefore, support my assumption. They suggest that althoughthere is not a great difference between nuclear and extendedfamily views on their religion, the nuclear families tend to be moretraditional than the extended families. The figures for peoplewithout a family in the new country are interesting. The level ofprivate religious practice, daily prayer, wearing sudreandkustiandtheir emphasis on the importance of preserving the religion wasas high as any other group, and sometimes (notably in prayer)much higher. Their involvement in community activities waslower; for example, participation in festivals and religious func-tions, wearing Indian or Iranian dress and the importanceattached to using the traditional language. They were also thegroup which considered that their religious beliefs and practiceshad changed in the new country. In practice, therefore, it seemsthat Associations are appreciated most by nuclear families. Is it thecase that extended families feel less need of networking beyondthe family?Families with children (Table 15)An impression I had gained from fieldwork is that having a childaffects, among other things, a person’s perspective on their heri-tage, and that the process of marriage and parenthood commonlyreturned a person to their traditions. Table 15 in Appendix 2Globalizing Trends679"},{"pageNumber":699,"pageContent":"compares the figures for people who had, and those who didnot have, children. More of those with children said they woresudreandkustioften; more of them expressed traditional views onintermarriage and on excluding non-Zoroastrians from westernprayer rooms. More of those with children affirmed a belief inthe diverse forms of the after life; more of them attended aZoroastrian centre for religious functions than did those withoutchildren. More of those with children accepted the religiousauthority of the old country, yet they defined their citizenshipmore in terms of the country of residence, whereas those withoutchildren tended to assert citizenship of their country of birth.Home, it appears, is where the children are. More of those withchildren asserted their Zoroastrian identity. The pattern with secular dimensions of the tradition is less clear cut. There waslittle difference regarding the practice of wearing Indian orIranian dress, but more of those with children often ate Indianor Iranian food. Although the differences were small, there wasa trend for more of those with children to say that they wished topreserve traditions associated with food, music, dress, religionand language. Having children, therefore, appears to result in agreater concern to practice the religion, to follow its teachings andpreserve their customs.Intermarrieds (Table 16)The figures in Tables 13–15 in Appendix 2 relate to all marriages.It is the contention of some in the community that marriage toa non-Zoroastrian is associated with a weakened commitment tothe religion. Table 16 in Appendix 2 compares the answers to thekey religious questions of respondents who had married withinthe community with those who had married out. More of the ‘in-marrieds’ said that they prayed daily than did the ‘out-marrieds’, more said that they wore the sudreandkustidaily andthat they attended religious functions regularly. More of themexpressed the traditional perspective on wanting a dokhmafuneral;more of them affirmed a belief in the afterlife and considered thatprayers for the dead were essential, and more of them affirmedthat such prayers benefited the dead, whereas the out-marriedstended to take a more humanistic view and considered that theprayers benefited the living. More of the in-marrieds accepted thereligious authority of the old country. More of the out-marriedsGlobalizing Trends680"},{"pageNumber":700,"pageContent":"thought their religious beliefs and practice had changed consi-derably since migration. Whereas the in-marrieds defined theircitizenship in terms of the country of birth, or as Zoroastrians, theout-marrieds tended to define their citizenship in terms of thecountry of residence. The pattern of the in-marrieds assertingtheir traditional culture was expressed in secular matters also.More of the in-marrieds often ate Indian or Iranian food, and reg-ularly wore Indian or Iranian dress. More in-marrieds than out-marrieds thought it worth preserving not only the religion, butalso music, dress and language (though not food and art), but thedifferences were not as marked on the secular dimensions of lifeas they were on the religious dimension.The interpretation of these figures, however, is not simple. Theydo not necessarily show that it is the less religious who marry out,or that intermarriage makes them less religious. It could be thatthe awareness of a hostile reception at community functionsdrives people away from the religion. These figures do not showcause and effect; they give a snapshot of which religious beliefsand practices were associated with different groups at the time ofthe survey.Who are the religious people?A different way of identifying patterns of religious belief andpractice is to compare the demographic details of those whoaffirmed religious belief and practice and those who did not. This isdone in Tables 17–21 in Appendix 2 by comparing first the figuresfor those who said that they prayed regularly with those who saidthat they rarely or never prayed. Second, Table 18 compares thefigures for those who said that they attended a Zoroastrian centreregularly and those who said that they rarely attended. Finally,Table 22 compares the figures for those who said that they wereOrthodox, Liberal and Non-practising. Are there identifiabledemographic trends behind these self-identified active and non-active religious people? Analysing the figures this way cross-checkssome of the assertions made above.‘Pray-ers’ and ‘non-pray-ers’ (Table 17)In regional terms, the centres with the highest proportions of peoplewho said that they prayed daily were from Karachi, Melbourne,Houston and Sydney (93%, 94%, 91%, 90% respectively).Globalizing Trends681"},{"pageNumber":701,"pageContent":"The groups where fewer people said that they prayed daily were thescattered groups in Canada, USA and Britain (76%, 79%, 80%).The first comment to make is that all these figures for praying dailywere high, more than one would expect from a study of the widerpopulation. They also highlight a general point made in this study,namely that religion is an important factor in the lives (and identities)of diaspora Zoroastrians. But a pattern of 12–17% difference isnoteworthy and merits comment. The Karachi figure should betreated cautiously, for this table is of those who now live in Karachi,not the people who migrated from Karachi, and the Karachisample, as noted earlier, is almost certainly skewed. Melbourne andSydney were probably high because they were the most recentsettlements and people living there were still emotionally close to theold country. Houston was seen in Chapter 8 to be perhaps the mosttraditional centre in North America, probably because of the highproportion of people who had migrated there from Pakistan. It hasalso been noted before that it was people living in the scatteredgroups, with few fellow Zoroastrians nearby to provide the supportnetwork, who tended to practise their religion least.There was remarkably little difference between the figures forthose who have been in the West for over thirty years and thosewho had arrived later, though the figures for those in their firstyear in the New World were significantly higher if the very lowsample size is accepted (Appendix 2, Table 17). This tableconfirms the earlier assertion that women pray more than men do.The figures for people of different age groups who prayed showthat the percentage increases steadily with each decade of a per-sons life, with 67% of the under-twenties saying they prayed daily,compared with 93% of those over the age of 70. Although feweryoung Zoroastrians said that they prayed daily, that remains ahigh percentage in comparison with what one is likely to find inthe wider population. A higher proportion of the married, andespecially the widowed, respondents affirmed that they prayedregularly than did single people. Fewer out-married than in-married people said that they prayed regularly. More of thosewho read in Gujarati asserted that they prayed regularly than didmembers of any other group, with fewer Persian readers sayingthey prayed regularly than did the English readers. More of thosewhose education was completed at school level and more of thearts than the science students asserted that they prayed regularly.Globalizing Trends682"},{"pageNumber":702,"pageContent":"More of those who went to religious classes in childhood affirmedthat they prayed regularly. Education therefore, has an importantimpact on religious practice.Zoroastrian networks (Tables 18–20)Many more of those who said that they regularly attended acentre affirmed that they prayed daily, wore sudreandkustioften,wanted a dokhmafuneral, objected to intermarriage, and wanted toexclude non-Zoroastrians from the prayer room (Appendix 2,Table 18). Many more of the regular than the rare attendeesaffirmed their belief in one or more forms of the afterlife, moreof them asserted that prayers for the dead were essential andbenefit the dead than did the non-attendees. More of the regularattendees accepted that the religious authority lies in the oldcountry, and more of them said that they had not changed eithertheir religious beliefs or practices in the New World. More non-attendees asserted their identity in terms of the country of resi-dence, and fewer asserted that they were Zoroastrians. In terms ofsecular culture, more of those who attended a Zoroastrian centreregularly said that they ate Indian or Iranian food often, and moreof them said they wore Indian or Iranian dress—though more ofthe non-attendees said that the traditional food was worth keeping.More of the regular attendees asserted the value of the seculartraditions, though the percentage difference was not as great as itwas when the question was posed whether respondents thoughtthat the religion and the language should be preserved. Thosewho attended regularly tended to have a more positive opinion ofinternal community relations.However much conflict the establishment of centres sometimesprovokes within an Association, their effect is marked in thepreservation of both religious and secular traditions.Appendix 2, Table 19 compares the figures for those who didand those who did not read some form of Zoroastrian literatureregularly. Once again, there was a clear trend for those who keptin contact with fellow Zoroastrians, in this instance through theirreading, to assert that they practised their religion more regularly.This commitment was shown in various ways: in the numbersof those who prayed daily, wearing sudreandkustiregularly, indisplaying traditional attitudes to intermarriage, believing in thediverse forms of the afterlife, in the assertion of their ZoroastrianGlobalizing Trends683"},{"pageNumber":703,"pageContent":"identity, and in valuing secular practices associated with food,dress, music, art or language. The link between readingZoroastrian literature and practising the religion and preserving thecultural traditions was strong. These figures do not establish thateither was the cause of the other, but are rather an indicatorthat the two go together. The most widely read single piece ofZoroastrian literature was Parsiana, but the local newsletters werethe type of literature most commonly taken. Tables 18 and 19together, therefore, indicate the importance of local efforts to havea centre and newsletter, however much work they require.Table 20 in Appendix 2 compares the beliefs and practices ofthose who said that they kept in regular correspondence withZoroastrians ‘abroad’, and those who said that they rarely ornever did. A note of caution must be registered before proceedingto discuss this table. There is a substantial difference in samplesize, N\u00021151 that regularly corresponded compared with 179who rarely corresponded with Zoroastrians ‘abroad’. With a sampleof 179, however, the figures, though to be treated with caution,may be acceptable. What the figures do show is the extent ofinternational networking among diaspora Zoroastrians. More ofthose who said that they kept in regular contact said that theyprayed daily, wore sudreandkustioften, more of them objected tointermarriage and affirmed a belief in an afterlife. More of themaffirmed the importance of the prayers for the dead, but morewho did not keep in contact with Zoroastrians abroad affirmedthe ‘humanist’ opinion that such prayers helped the living ratherthan the dead. The ‘regular corresponders’ said they attendedZoroastrian centres regularly, and fewer of them asserted that theyhad changed their religious beliefs very much. Apart from food,the ‘regular correspondents’ affirmed the importance of the vari-ous ethnic traditions, but especially the religion and language. Intheory one can practise the Zoroastrian religion when livingalone. There is no requirement to go to a temple; what is requiredis to say the prayers, for Parsis to wear the sudreandkusti, observethe purity laws and pray before the fire—but that can, and ideallyshould, be the sun. In reality, however, Zoroastrians observe theirreligion more closely when their beliefs and practices are reaf-firmed by contact with fellow Zoroastrians. The networks aretherefore of major importance in perpetuating the tradition, andthey reaffirm the secular culture also. Both groups, however, seeGlobalizing Trends684"},{"pageNumber":704,"pageContent":"preserving traditional food as important; indeed it is viewed aseven more important than religion by those who do not corres-pond with fellow Zoroastrians. The data garnered from this sur-vey therefore confirms the anecdotal evidence discussed inChapter 7, specifically the interviews in France and Germany.The Orthodox, Liberals and non-practitioners (Table 21)Just as it was interesting to see who the people were who tended topray, etc., so also it is interesting to see if there is any clear type ofperson who tends to be Orthodox, or Liberal—or who does notpractise the religion [ N\u0002208, 910, 175]. Table 21, Appendix 2,compares the figures for those who chose these designations froma list of possibilities. The overall breakdown of figures shows that16% of respondents who used these three labels described them-selves as Orthodox, 70% as Liberal, and 14% said that they didnot practise the religion. The diaspora, overall, therefore consid-ered itself to be Liberal, with almost as many saying they did notpractise the religion as used the self-description of Orthodox. Butthere were different patterns between different groups.The centres where most people said that they were Orthodoxwere Melbourne, Kenya and California (29%, 24%, 23%respectively).194The centres where the smallest proportiondescribed themselves as Orthodox were Chicago and the scatteredgroups in the USA (9%, 13%). Conversely, the cities where thelargest numbers asserted that they were Liberal were Houston,Chicago and New York (78%, 76%, 73% respectively). The placeswhere fewer respondents said that they were Liberal were Kenya,the scattered groups in Canada and California (62%, 63%, 65%).The cities where most people said that they were non-practisingwere the scattered groups in both Canada and USA, Toronto andSydney (19%, 17%, 16%, 16% respectively). The cities where fewestpeople said that they did not practise were Melbourne, and Houston(5%, 7% respectively). There were, therefore, some geographicalpatterns. It was the scattered groups in Canada, USA (andBritain) who were most likely to say that they were either Liberalor non-practising. These patterns highlight an important point,namely what one person considered to be ‘Orthodox,’ may haveGlobalizing Trends685194In what follows I have omitted the figures for Karachi because the sample there wasskewed."},{"pageNumber":705,"pageContent":"been ‘Liberal’ to someone else. This is important in assessing theHouston figures, for the respondents from there consistentlyshowed themselves to be more traditional than respondents fromChicago were, even though more of them used the self-descriptionof Liberal. What might have been perceived as Liberal in Karachimight have been seen as Orthodox in Chicago.It would, however, be wrong to classify all Zoroastrians in onecentre as belonging to any one group. For example, the mostOrthodox home in North America in which I have been fortunateto stay was in California. The purity laws were strictly maintained.A fire was kept burning in the home, and during periods of men-struation the wife would go to stay in a hotel in order to avoiddefiling the fire. She could not travel to the hotel in their car, oth-erwise that would have been polluted and could not be used fortransporting the fire. She therefore used a taxi. (Husband and wifefound the impression this gave to neighbours highly amusing!)The Orthodox or Khshnoomist magazine Mazdayasnie Connectionisedited from California, which is also the base of the TraditionalMazdayasni Anjuman. In stark contrast, California is whereJafarey works, and where there are many Iranian Zoroastrianswho in the eyes of most Parsis would be considered ‘Liberal’.These diversities were not simply scattered round the large state,but were all found in the Los Angeles/Anaheim area. This noteon California highlights the danger of depicting Zoroastrians inone centre as a monolithic whole; one can only write about broadtrends or patterns.As Table 21 in Appendix 2 shows, generally, more of the peo-ple who had lived in the diaspora for the longest time (thirty yearsand more) described themselves as Orthodox and those who hadbeen there for a shorter time (under thirty years) were more likelyto describe themselves as Liberals. Approximately one in ten forall years described themselves as non-practitioners. The peoplewho had been in the diaspora for less than a year were the groupin which most people said that they did not practise the religion,yet a highish proportion said they were Orthodox and in varioustables they emerged as having high levels of religious practice.The explanation for these figures may be that recent migrantsfrom the subcontinent were polarized between those who hadchosen to distance themselves emotionally as well as physicallyfrom the old country and those who had a strong desire to preserveGlobalizing Trends686"},{"pageNumber":706,"pageContent":"their heritage.195The gender differences were small, though asmaller proportion of women than men described themselves asnon-practising. Age appeared to be a bigger factor than length ofresidence in the country, at least as far as Orthodoxy and non-practitioners were concerned. More respondents who were under25 years of age said that they did not practise the religion andfewer described themselves as Orthodox than did members of anyother group. The position was reversed with the elders; morepeople described themselves as Orthodox than said that they werenot practising.In terms of families, more married and especially widowedrespondents described themselves as Orthodox, and fewerdescribed themselves as not practising. In contrast, fewer single orseparated people said that they were Orthodox, and more of themsaid that they were non-practising. It is difficult to see any patternassociated with the different types of family. More of those whohad married out said that they were not practising the religionthan did the in-marrieds. More people who read Gujarati litera-ture asserted their Orthodoxy, and fewer of them said that theydid not practise their religion. Fewer people who read Persiandescribed themselves as Orthodox, and were as likely as ‘English-only-readers’ to describe themselves as non-practitioners.Education was a factor in religious self-description: more schoolleavers than any other educational group described themselvesas Orthodox, and fewer of them described themselves as ‘non-practitioners.’ By contrast, fewer postgraduates said that they wereOrthodox, and more said that they were not practising the reli-gion. More science than arts graduates said that they did not prac-tise the religion. In terms of career, more of those in clericalgrades described themselves as Orthodox, whereas more of thosein executive-level employment said that they did not practise thereligion. Respondents who rarely corresponded with or met fellowZoroastrians in the diaspora generally described themselves as notpractising, whereas most who were in contact with Zoroastriansoverseas and in the diaspora said that they were Orthodox. Morerespondents who had attended Zoroastrian classes in their youthdescribed themselves as Orthodox, compared with those who hadGlobalizing Trends687195As there were only twenty-four respondents who had migrated within the previoustwelve months, the figures are at best suggestive. It may be that such a small sample yieldsan unsafe result."},{"pageNumber":707,"pageContent":"had no such classes and it was the latter who were more likely tosay that they did not practise the religion.There are, therefore, patterns of age, family, language, child-hood education and religious classes, higher and scientific educa-tion, and contact with Zoroastrian networks, which emerged asimportant factors in the formation of the self-perceivedOrthodox, Liberal and Non-practising diaspora Zoroastrians.The perception of discrimination (Table 22)Discrimination was a problem perceived by approximately one inthree of my respondents. Appendix 2, Table 22 gives the figuresfor that perception among different groups. It was most com-monly asserted by people from East Africa, or respondents whohad been born in the West, and especially by those who hadmigrated in the 1960s. Fewer recent migrants said that they hadfaced discrimination. Men rather than women said that they faceddiscrimination. The people who most commonly said that theyhad faced discrimination were in the age range 30 to 60; thoseleast likely to make this assertion were the young (under 20) andthose over 70. Those who were separated or divorced more com-monly said that they had faced discrimination, and more of thoserespondents who were married to a non-Zoroastrian, in compari-son with the in-marrieds, similarly believed that they faceddiscrimination. It was a perception more commonly expressedamong those who read Persian, and by people who had been edu-cated both in the old and the new countries. More of those whohad undertaken postgraduate studies, those who had studied sci-ence, and those in the highest level of employment, consideredthat they had faced discrimination. More of those who were notin close contact with their own community, either in the diaspora,or in correspondence with Zoroastrians ‘abroad’, said that theyhad faced discrimination.These figures contain trends that might surprise some people.The general population’s stereotype of those facing discrimina-tion is that they are the least well-educated, those who bury them-selves in their own community and do not ‘assimilate’. Thatstereotypical image is contradicted here, especially by the figuresfor the highly educated, scientists, and those in the highest levelsof employment. Further, it was the people who did not keep incontact with their community, including those who had marriedGlobalizing Trends688"},{"pageNumber":708,"pageContent":"out, who were most likely to consider that they faced prejudice.These figures suggest that there is no one type of person who pro-vokes discrimination, unless attaining a high education and beingsuccessful does so—out of jealousy? The anecdotal evidence ofmy own conversations with Zoroastrians in fifteen countries overthree decades is that it is often people in the legal and medical pro-fessions who consider that they have faced discrimination. Thereis a strong feeling in many countries that to succeed you have tobe seen to be twice as good as the local person. People whom Iknow well personally have had threatening phone calls and win-dows smashed; they include successful lawyers, accountants and inone case someone active in mainstream party politics. TheZoroastrians in many countries reasonably feel that they have con-tributed much to their societies, but a substantial proportionbelieve that they have been discriminated against by that society.However, there are many who have said that they do not face dis-crimination. Some respondents to the trial run of the survey, andclose friends, urged me not to include this question in my surveybecause they did not face discrimination, and asking about itmight cause concern. I did not wish to arouse concern, but itseemed to me, then and now, that such questions need to beaddressed. One person said that because the Parsis were so edu-cated, successful and assimilated they did not face discrimination.Unfortunately, from this survey it seems that it is precisely suchpeople who are most likely to consider that they have faceddiscrimination.Questions of identity (Table 23:1–22)A theme throughout this book, but highlighted particularly inChapter 8 on North America, and in some of the tables studied inthis section, is the diversity of self-understandings of manyZoroastrians. For example, some people who have migrated sawtheir identity in terms of the country of birth, others emphasizedthe country of present residence, yet others identified themselvessimply as Zoroastrian and others as an amalgam of these. Thesubject is so important and complex that it merits more extensivetreatment here. Table 23 analyses the survey under the heading ofCitizenship. It is again important to emphasize that this surveywas conducted in the mid 1980s—when vocabulary was used andacademic debates pursued in a way that they would not be in theGlobalizing Trends689"},{"pageNumber":709,"pageContent":"new millennium. The issue of whether the offspring of migrantswere ‘caught between cultures’ has been one example discussed inthe Introduction and which will again be considered in theConclusion. Similarly, the following discussion on citizenshipwould now be phrased differently, especially in Britain wheremany Zoroastrian youth themselves seek to distinguish betweencitizenship—in terms of which passport you hold—race, ethnicity,religion and culture. The term ‘citizenship’ has become moreproblematic in academic discourse in Britain since theGovernment has devised curricula in schools to make pupils ‘bet-ter citizens’. Nevertheless, some of the issues lying behind thisvocabulary are still concerns in the third millennium, and meritreflection. It would have been artificial and improper to cloak thisdiscussion in vocabulary which was not used in the questionnaire.The figures in Appendix 2, Table 23 show a limited range ofresponses; many respondents indicated ‘other’, but they yieldedsuch a diverse range that they could not be included within theconfines of this book.196That very diversity highlights the com-plexity of respondents’ self understandings. The overall patternwas that most respondents wished to assert their Zoroastrian iden-tity, usually as Zoroastrian citizens of the country of residence, buteven there, and certainly in terms of ‘old’ and new countries,there was a range of responses so that numerous qualifications areessential.Table 23(1), analyses the responses of Zoroastrians living inall the countries studied, except Kenya, where few respondentsanswered this question because it was a very sensitive one inthis country at the time of the survey. The high percentage ofrespondents from Hong Kong who asserted their identity by coun-try of birth may be misleading because it is not uncommon formothers-to-be to go to India for the birth, to be with family there.Few Hong Kong respondents wanted to assert their identity interms of their place of residence, not even as Zoroastrian citizensof what was a British colony at the time of the survey.Two sets of figures stand out: the low percentage of respondentsfrom Toronto and from Canada in general who asserted theircitizenship in terms of the old country, in comparison withGlobalizing Trends690196Four hundred and thirty-three respondents indicated a further combination ofamalgamations of self-descriptions, fifty-eight indicated ‘other’."},{"pageNumber":710,"pageContent":"respondents from the USA. In Chapter 8 emphasis was laid on thedifferent perceptions of the benefits of Canadian multiculturalismand the perceived threat of the melting pot in the USA.Many more Canadian respondents identified themselves asCanadians, whereas in the USA identity was asserted in terms ofcountry of birth, or simply as Zoroastrians. Few Americanrespondents wanted to assert their identity as Americans. Therewere differences between different centres in the USA. InCalifornia more respondents wanted to assert their identity interms either of the country of birth, or as Zoroastrians of the oldcountry, a feature reflecting the high number of responses fromIranian Zoroastrians there. Compared with other centres in theUSA, more Chicago respondents were willing to assert their iden-tity in terms of the country of residence, especially as Zoroastrianresidents of that country, in contrast, for example, with respond-ents from Houston or New York. In the chapter on NorthAmerica, Chicago respondents were seen to be typically ‘Liberal’,Houston respondents more traditional, including their ties to theold country.In Melbourne, as in Canada, fewer respondents asserted theircitizenship in terms of the old country, and more of them assertedtheir Australian identity. In Chapter 9 on Australia it was notedthat the constitution of the Melbourne Association emphasized itsmembers’ commitment to, and role in, Australia, more than anyother constitution studied in the course of this work emphasizedits national ties. In Sydney, in contrast, there was seen to be anunusual degree of Zoroastrian involvement with other emigrésfrom India and so more respondents from that Association thanfrom Melbourne identified themselves with the old country. InLondon, the emphasis was on simply being Zoroastrian. It wouldbe interesting to see whether any further survey taken after theZTFE’s involvement in inter-faith activities has affected that self-perception.Table 23 (2) presents the responses to the question of citizenshipaccording to country of previous residence. Fewer people born inthe West asserted their Zoroastrian identity, though even here, two-thirds wished to do so. Iranian Zoroastrians more than any othergroup asserted their citizenship in terms of the old country. Few whohad migrated from East Africa or Pakistan asserted their identity interms of the country of birth—understandably perhaps in thatGlobalizing Trends691"},{"pageNumber":711,"pageContent":"the ‘old country’ did not feel like ‘their country’. They thereforepreferred to describe themselves either as simply Zoroastrians, ormore often as Zoroastrian citizens of the country of residence.Although most respondents who had migrated from India identifiedthemselves in terms of the new country, a bigger proportion assertedtheir citizenship in terms of the old country than did people fromany other country, except those from Iran.In broad terms, the people who had settled in the New World atan earlier time were willing to identify themselves as citizens of thecountry of residence (Appendix 2, table 23(3)). The exceptions,however, were the very early settlers, people who migrated beforethe 1960s. This feature becomes yet more marked if the low num-ber of respondents who had migrated in the 1940s [ N\u000244] isallowed; then those older migrants maintained their identity interms of the country of birth, and fewer of them used the self-appellation of ‘Zoroastrian’. On several issues, the people whomigrated in the 1970s, and especially the 1960s, have been seen tobe the innovative, ‘Liberal’ members of the various communities.The later 1980s migrants still tended to define themselves in termsof the old country.Location is but one factor affecting perceptions of citizenship.Gender is another (Appendix 2, Table 23(4)). Women tended toidentify more with the old country than men did, and they identi-fied themselves as Zoroastrians more than men did. One elementin this may perhaps be where women are at home as the home-makers, for we will see below under career that it is people who goout to their workplace who tended to be those who identified withthe new country more. Another factor is likely to be—as discussedelsewhere in this section—that women tended to be more active inthe religion than men were.Age is also a factor (Appendix 2, Table 23(5)). Roughly one infive respondents identified themselves as citizens of the country ofbirth, more younger people identified themselves as Zoroastriancitizens of their birthplace, but most older respondents (40 yearsold and upwards) identified themselves as Zoroastrian citizensof the country of residence. This trend for elders rather thanyoung people to identify with the new country goes againstmany of the stereotypical images of the youth in diasporacommunities seeking to ‘break away’ from the culture of theirparent’s generation.Globalizing Trends692"},{"pageNumber":712,"pageContent":"Families are also a factor in self-perceptions of citizenship(Appendix 2, Table 23 (6–9)). Married people tended to asserttheir citizenship in terms of the country of residence, and theirZoroastrian identity, more than did single people and in particu-lar contrast with widowed people, who tended to identify with theold country. The first thought to explain this last point is that it isa factor of age, but in the previous paragraph more older peoplethan younger ones were seen to assert their identity in terms of thecountry of residence. Few of the elders identified themselves asZoroastrian citizens of the old country.Respondents who had married out of the community tendedto identify themselves more as citizens of the new country, orcountry of residence. Few of them asserted their identity asZoroastrian citizens of the country of birth, but more of themidentified themselves as Zoroastrian citizens of the country ofresidence. Having children seems to have a significant correlation(a word not used here in its technical sense) with identity in termsof the country of residence—home is where the children are—particularly with being a Zoroastrian citizen of the new country.Members of nuclear rather than extended families tended to iden-tify with the country of residence. This finding surprised me. Ihad anticipated that the presence of parents, siblings, etc. wouldmake people feel more ‘at home’ in the new country, whereasthese figures suggest that living within a small Zoroastrian worldencourages contact with the old country. Nuclear families perhapsmix more with non-Zoroastrians, and so more of them identifiedthemselves as citizens of the country of residence.In view of the impact of levels and types of education on otherissues discussed in this section it was natural to expect that sucheducational patterns might impact on the perceptions of citizen-ship (Appendix 2, Table 23 (10–11)). The more highly educatedand the scientists tended to identify with the country of residencerather than with that of birth, but the differences were relativelysmall. The picture is more complex when career patterns arestudied. Broadly speaking, the high career achievers in employmentterms tended to assert their citizenship in terms of the countryof residence, particularly as Zoroastrian citizens of the country ofresidence, whereas people who were mostly focused on the home,retired people and homemakers, tended to assert their identity interms of the old country. The outside workplace (i.e. the distinctionGlobalizing Trends693"},{"pageNumber":713,"pageContent":"is not between unemployed and employed, since homemaking isclearly a major demand and of prime importance) tended to beassociated with linking people to the country of residence, andwith the straightforward assertion of being a Zoroastrian.One obvious set of issues is the extent to which Zoroastriannetworks did or did not reinforce links with the old or thenew country (Appendix 2, Table 23 (13–16)). Corresponding withZoroastrians in other countries was clearly seen to be somethingwhich continued ties with the old country—more of the regularcorrespondents asserted their identity in terms of the old countryrather than of residence, more of them consistently emphasizedtheir Zoroastrian identity. The same is true of people who keptin contact with fellow Zoroastrians ‘here’—whichever diasporiccommunity they were part of. The trend of asserting Zoroastrianidentity can also be traced in the table for respondents who readZoroastrian literature and for those who attended a Zoroastriancentre regularly. Clearly involvement in the various Zoroastriannetworks is associated with the preservation and assertion of aZoroastrian identity. That may seem an obvious point to make,but it is a point which can easily be overlooked when academicsstudy just one dimension of a diasporic community. The surveywas undertaken prior to the boom in the use of the Internet. Ifthis study were to be replicated now, I have little doubt but that italso would be seen to be significant. In the West it is often assumedthat religion is a matter of private belief. That is clearly an over-simplification in the study of Asian cultures and religions ingeneral; it is certainly not an appropriate assumption aboutZoroastrians. The importance of the networking illustrates howand why some of the ‘forgotten Zoroastrians’ mentioned at theend of Chapter 6 on East Africa were forgotten. It was—and is—difficult to maintain a Zoroastrian identity living apart from aZoroastrian community. Some might argue that the fact that indi-viduals lived apart from Zoroastrians shows that they had alreadylost their identity. My experience of meeting Zoroastrians inFrance and Germany (Chapter 7), where people, some with astrong sense of Zoroastrian identity, have been compelled for pro-fessional reasons to live in a country with very few Zoroastriannetworks, and where—to an outsider at least—there appears to bea consequent threat to their Zoroastrian identity. Despite commonassertions that someone can be a Zoroastrian and practise theGlobalizing Trends694"},{"pageNumber":714,"pageContent":"religion anywhere and without substantial religious resources, inpractice it is evident that people without complex Zoroastriannetworks tend to lose their ‘Zoroastrian-ness’.A further and related question is to enquire whether commit-ment to Zoroastrian practices and beliefs, especially those relatingto the non-Zoroastrian world, impact on the sense of citizenship.Table 23 (17 and 18)) indicates that more of the people whorarely prayed or wore sudreandkustiwere more likely to asserttheir identity in terms of the country of birth, whereas those whoregularly practised their religion tended rather to assert their iden-tity in terms of the country of residence, specifically asZoroastrian citizens of the new country. It is, therefore, not simplythat in theory there is no conflict between being a Zoroastrian andbeing committed to the new country; if anything it is practisingZoroastrians who are most likely to assert citizenship of the newcountry.The pattern was somewhat different with the questions relatingto Zoroastrian attitudes to non-Zoroastrians (Appendix 2, Table 23(19–23)). Respondents who were opposed to intermarriagemore often asserted their identity in terms of the old country, andespecially as Zoroastrians—the same was true of the responses onthe question of allowing non-Zoroastrians into a prayer room‘here’ in the West. When asked for their perception of Zoroastrianrelations with the non-Zoroastrian world ‘here’, those whoasserted their Zoroastrian identity, especially those who said thatthey were Zoroastrian citizens of the new country, were the peo-ple who considered relations with non-Zoroastrians to be excel-lent. There was, however, a small (but only a small) pattern ofthose who asserted their Zoroastrian citizenship of the old coun-try to be those who were more cautious about what they consid-ered the ‘mixed’ state of community relations. The pattern is lesseasy to identify with regard to those who considered that theyhave faced discrimination. The majority of those who believed thatthey had faced discrimination nevertheless identified themselves ascitizens of the place of residence rather than of the old country.This set of figures once more challenges the common stereotypecreated by the majority of western populations that people facingdiscrimination are those who would not identify with their newcountry of residence. This set of figures suggests precisely theopposite. Those who asserted their Zoroastrian citizenship areGlobalizing Trends695"},{"pageNumber":715,"pageContent":"the very people who mostly said that they faced discrimination inthat new country despite their allegiance to it.ConclusionIn the nineteenth century there were relatively few internationalcontacts between Zoroastrian diaspora groups. Those that therewere went from the diaspora directly back to India, like spokes ona wheel back to the hub, with no surrounding rim. Through thesecond half of the twentieth century, and especially at the turn ofthe millennium, there has been substantial and increasing inter-action between the various diasporic groups. Those in HongKong and East Africa are somewhat less active internationally, butthose in the New World interact regularly at a global level.Perhaps networking is a phenomenon of urban or metropolitangroups. It has been less effective between urban and rural groups.The work of the WZO appears to have brought, apparently forthe first time, an awareness, even in nearby Mumbai, ofZoroastrian poverty in the rural areas of Gujarat. There had beenprevious reports, as discussed in Chapter 2, but these appear tohave lain gathering dust in libraries, so that the videos which weremade of the problems came as a complete shock to many. Theurban Zoroastrians, in India and America, appear to have a grow-ing appreciation of Zoroastrian poverty in rural Iran because ofthe pilgrimages to the old centres, but there has not (yet) been thesame surge of economic and material aid as there has been inGujarat.Global interaction has resulted in various Associations adoptingsimilar strategies for community survival. The obvious example isthe activity in the field of inter-faith dialogue and participation inmulticultural events. This has been especially evident in Americaand Britain, but leading Indian figures, for example, DastursJamaspAsa and Kotwal and Dr Homi Dhalla, have travelled fromIndia for events at the United Nations or the Vatican. ZTFE’srecent role in multi-faith activities in Britain resulted inZoroastrianism being recognized as one of the nation’s nine reli-gions, and leaders participating in national events have given thereligion a visibility which it is to be hoped will counter some of theignorant media reports, that had previously been common inGlobalizing Trends696"},{"pageNumber":716,"pageContent":"western countries. In this and other fields of activity Associationsin different countries have learned from each other. Documentsand policies are discussed by e-mail, on Internet sites and bytelephone. But in my own experience interaction is also strongthrough personal meetings at congresses or broken journeys whenvisiting another country on business. The Zoroastrian world isboth global and yet small; it is one where news and views are fre-quently exchanged. The telephone network is not documentable,but having spent countless periods in Zoroastrian homes aroundthe world for decades, I am deeply conscious of how people in onepart of the world know and talk to fellow Zoroastrians elsewherefrequently and at length. This is especially true between America,Britain, India and Pakistan; it is a little less true for Australia, andeven less so with Hong Kong and East Africa, although the HongKong–India links are very close. Contact between Mumbai andthe rural areas is better, not only through the work of WZO, butalso through that of other groups such as Zoroastrian Studies,who have had projects to help the poor Parsis in Gujarat, or proj-ects to save Udwada from coastal erosion. Travel betweenMumbai and Surat is reasonable, but contact beyond that to thevillages I found was not common as recently as 2002. But pil-grimage to important historical or holy sites, Sanjan, Bahrotcaves, Navsari, Surat and especially Udwada are growing in popu-larity; however, they do not include the small and remotevillages. Interaction depends more on technology than it does onconventional means of travel. The Peterson naujotein New Yorktriggered debates around the Zoroastrian world. Issues of globalstrategy and leadership, of economic aid or religious guidance,result in worldwide interaction. Further, wherever Zoroastriansmay be settled, there are common patterns of who believes andpractises the religion, and in what manner. Zoroastrians in thediaspora often face local challenges; they also experience globaltrends.External and internal community forces have resulted in com-plex perceptions of identity. They are affected by national policiesin the different countries, by where people migrated from, by fam-ily and community networks, education, career gender and byreligious belief and practice. If this study were to be replicatedthen a sophisticated analysis would undoubtedly highlight yetgreater complexity in the issues of identity. But the great majority,Globalizing Trends697"},{"pageNumber":717,"pageContent":"religious people and the non-religious, commonly still highlighttheir Zoroastrian-ness, however that is interpreted.The precise figures for percentage responses can give too strongan impression of objectivity. Respondents’ understanding of ques-tions and therefore their responses can vary. One example citedabove is the interpretation of terms such as Orthodox andLiberal, especially when comparing responses from people in thenew world and the old world. What is Orthodox in America maynot seem to be so in India, and the phrase ‘mother tongue’ maybe interpreted differently. Nevertheless, such surveys can be help-ful in painting a broad picture of patterns and trends. In my ownopinion these must be cross-checked by fieldwork on the ground.I also found the survey findings helpful in highlighting issues to beconsidered in research visits to the various communities. TheBritish community apart, my survey work was undertaken prior tothe research visit for fear of affecting the data I collected. I com-monly asked Zoroastrians if they found that the patterns identi-fied in the survey reflected their own perceptions and experience,and I am glad to say they commonly did.This research, especially the survey, focused wholly onZoroastrians. I am not claiming that they are unique in theirdemographic patterns, for example the impact of postgraduateresearch or studies in science on religious belief and practice. Itwould be interesting to see whether similar patterns are to befound among other Asian diasporic communities. If this studywere to trigger comparable analyses of other communities thenthe value of this work would be greatly enhanced. It is importantto repeat the note of caution that this survey was conducted in the1980s and the patterns may be different in the third millenniumbecause of changing political (and Political) circumstances, andthe influence of the second and third generations in the NewWorld. It was fortuitous that the survey was conducted in a decadewith which the wisdom of hindsight was so significant inZoroastrian diaspora history, for example in relation to theZoroastrian refugees from Iran, the growing influence of EastAfrican Parsis in Britain, the patterns of settlement in NorthAmerica, and the emergence of communities in Australia. Itwould be fascinating to see how things have, and have not,changed.Globalizing Trends698"},{"pageNumber":718,"pageContent":"11ConclusionThe Zoroastrian DiasporasThere have been various Zoroastrian diasporas throughouthistory; the earliest were during Iran’s imperial history as theAchaemenid armies and traders moved through much of the thenknown world, a phenomenon that was repeated under theParthians and Sasanians. Just one example of a Zoroastrian dia-spora from this imperial era is that in Anatolia, and probablystarted under the Achaemenids, and assumed considerable his-toric importance in the first centuries BCE and CE.1The migra-tion of Zoroastrians to India, leading to the growth of the Parsicommunity there, was itself a diaspora. The modern Zoroastriandiaspora has taken place in two main phases: the mid-nineteenthcentury and the second half of the twentieth century. The first,which might be termed the older Zoroastrian diaspora, was toChina, Sind, East Africa and Britain; the second was to Britainagain (in the 1960s) and to the New World of Canada, USA andAustralia. This second phase involved more ‘sending countries’,Pakistan, East Africa and Iran, whereas the first had been justfrom India. There have been two groups of ‘twice migrants’,people from Pakistan and East Africa—indeed, if one includesthe migration to India one can speak of some Parsis fromBombay as ‘thrice migrants’. The British diaspora is different inthat it is part of both the nineteenth century, and the post-1960migrations. The foundations of the community were laid by thefirst diaspora, but it was during the second period that the largernumbers settled. The global picture is yet more complicatedbecause there have been onward migrations in the western world,1For an extensive study see M. Boyce,A History of Zoroastrianism, vol. iii with FrantzGrenet,Zoroastrianism under Macedonian and Roman Rule, Leiden, 1991."},{"pageNumber":719,"pageContent":"for example from Britain to Canada, Australia and the UnitedStates.The first modern Zoroastrian diasporaThe first phase of the modern Zoroastrian diaspora had its rootsin the eighteenth century. The first Zoroastrian to visit Britaintravelled in 1724 and the early opium traders sailed from Bombayto the China Seas from 1794. The earliest indicator of the settle-ment of Zoroastrian groups is the acquisition of a funeral ground.These were obtained in Karachi in 1839, Canton (Whampoa) in1847, London in 1863, Zanzibar in 1883 and Mombasa in 1897.In each case there is an earlier history of Parsi travellers, mer-chants, and in the case of Britain, students. It was from these earlydiasporic settlements in the nineteenth century that much of themoney was earned which was remitted to India to enable thebuilding of temples and other communal resources.In China and East Africa the earliest Parsi visitors were doingjust that, paying a visit—they were usually men who had left theirfamilies back in India, where they normally returned after a fewyears. As resources grew, such as funeral grounds, Associationsand religious buildings, so families began to settle in the diasporaalso. Families settled in Sind from an early date, leading to theearly provision of a temple,dokhma, school and charitable dispens-ary. In one sense Sind was an ‘overseas’ Parsi community, fortravel was more often by ship than by land because of the difficultterrain. In another sense it was part of the same country—BritishIndia. All the migrations in this early period were linked to tradewithin the British Empire. The exception was Zanzibar, wheresome Parsis were recruited by Sultan Barghash as a result of hisstay in Bombay. But here also, the dominant trading power wasthe British.East Africa is the only settlement where professionals weremore usual than businessmen were. But even in East Africa thefamily with the most influence were merchants—CowasjiDinshaw and Brothers. Travellers to Britain came as travellers to‘the seat of empire’; others came for education, either formal uni-versity studies or to study at first hand British industry in order tobring about Bombay’s industrial revolution. Relatively few cameto Britain as merchants. There were exceptions, notably SirDhunjibhoy Bomanjee, but even he made his fortune not fromConclusion700"},{"pageNumber":720,"pageContent":"trade in Britain but rather as a supplier to the British in the BoerWar, which then enabled him to settle in Britain. Parsis made for-tunes through trade with the British overseas, not through trade inBritain, which was in the hands of the British.In all of this overseas trade Parsis, rightly or wrongly, consideredthat they had a special relationship with the British. This is to beseen in Bombay in the socializing between the two communities;in China where a Parsi (Sir Jamsetji Jijibhoy) was on the board ofdirectors of Jardine Matheson and Co. and on the committeewhich established the Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank; in Sind assuppliers in the Afghan Wars; in East Africa, as exemplified in thesuccessful plea to be subject to European not native laws; and inBritain above all in the role of the three MPs. The Parsi percep-tion of Anglo–Parsi relations was that they were different fromthose of other Indian communities with the British. They werealso convinced that they flourished under British rule. Saklatvallaand Madame Cama were unusual in the force of their criticism ofBritain. Although Naoroji eventually despaired at reformingBritish rule and so led the call for Independence, he neverthelessremained on good terms with the British. A nice illustration ofthis is that the (British) Governor of Bombay, Sir George Clarke,called upon Naoroji in his home to felicitate him on the occasionof his eighty-sixth birthday; this was not the act of a high officialto a ‘native’ for whom he had no respect.2Most western travellersto the various diasporic Parsi communities commented favourablyon the honesty, reliability and distinctiveness of the Parsis. Therewas little Parsi socializing with the Chinese, Black Africans orSindhis. One exception was cricket, a feature of most early settle-ments, where Parsis formed teams against other Indian communi-ties, all sharing the aim of beating the British team; otherwisecontact between Parsis and local Indian Associations was notcommon.The early Associations’ buildings were rather like ‘gentlemen’sclubs’, with provision for card games and billiards and papers toread; they were meeting places where Parsis socialized togetherrather than taking part in local pastimes. Karachi was different,and its facilities more extensive, because it quickly became a placeConclusion7012Naoroji Archive, Reel 6, C-169 (4) 8 Sept. 1910.

From the names on the various docu-ments quoted in each chapter it is evident that the traders in alldiasporic settlements were often related, brothers or cousins. Inthe various settlements the families of those early settlers oftencontinued even at the end of the twentieth century to be ‘the bigfamilies’. Relatively few families traded in more than one region.Few traded both in China and East Africa, for example. Somefamilies traded in more than one centre in a region, for exampleCowasji Dinshaw and Brothers in both Aden and Zanzibar andthe Jijibhoys in Canton, Shanghai and Hong Kong, But this wasrare. The general pattern was to develop extensive links in oneregion.In all centres in the earlier diaspora the religious life was prac-tised, with priests and temples in Zanzibar, Aden and Karachi andreligious buildings, if not temples, in China. The constitutions ofAssociations emphasized their Zoroastrian character, but teachingabout the religion was not part of their communal life. It was notseen as necessary for religious practice, or for their ethnic identity.London was slightly different. No religious provision was made inBritain until later in the twentieth century; indeed, the first build-ing to be purchased in Britain for Zoroastrian use was a hostel forParsi students at Edinburgh. Although there were few religiousfunctions, the constitution emphasized the Association’s supportfor research and publications about Zoroastrianism, not least toinfluence British public opinion. All early diaspora groups turnedto Bombay or Navsari as the source of religious authority anddirection. There was little or no contact between the diasporagroups, even between relatively ‘local’ communities, for example,between Canton and Hong Kong or Mombasa and Nairobi.Debates about intermarriage and the attendance of non-Zoroastrians at religious events, notably funerals, took place in allsettlements. Even those who wished to allow non-Zoroastriansinto community functions nevertheless maintained strict commun-ity boundaries. Inter-faith activities, regular outside socializing,and ‘assimilation’ were not features of this first sequence of dia-spora settlements.Iranian Zoroastrians were not at that time members of thesecommunities, for in the nineteenth century Zoroastrians in Iranwere suffering a period of oppression, with no opportunity toengage in overseas trade and travel. The one exception to this wasConclusion702"},{"pageNumber":722,"pageContent":"Sind. After the heroic work in Iran of Hataria, who worked assid-uously for nearly forty years (1854–90) to ease the financial andsocial oppression of Zoroastrians, some refugees made their wayto Karachi (and to Bombay) where they became known for theirtea shops.There have been examples of Parsi involvement in nationalpolitics in the first diaspora, for example in Sind, Zanzibar andKenya and in the role of the Parsis in the early history of theopium trade in Canton. The diasporic settlement where Parsiswere clearly involved in national politics in the nineteenth centurywas Britain, where Naoroji and Bhownaggree became membersof the Parliament at Westminster, followed by Saklatvalla in thetwentieth century. Although they stood for London constituencies,and occasionally spoke on local politics, fundamentally they wereseeking to present the case for the reform of British rule in India.It was only in Britain that Parsis published accounts of their his-tory and religion to inform the local population aboutZoroastrianism. The motive again was to influence British policy inIndia, and to mark out Parsis with their ancient Persian history asdifferent from other Indian groups, and to convey the high ethicaland social values of the religion that had impacted on Judaismand Christianity. It was as a result of this western travel, as well asthrough the visits of western scholars to India, that the Parsisdeveloped their interest in academic studies of their heritage. Thepioneer in this study was K. R. Cama, who on his return to Indiafrom business in Britain in 1851 stayed in France and Germany toundertake scholarly studies, which he then introduced in Bombay.It was therefore not only money but also scholarship and technologywhich diaspora Zoroastrians contributed to the old country.The second modern Zoroastrian diasporaThe later Zoroastrian diaspora in the second half of the twentiethcentury was different from the first. As noted above, the migrationwas from more countries, not only from India but also fromPakistan and East Africa, that is, of ‘twice migrants’, and fromIran. At first some Iranian Zoroastrians came to the West becauseof the opportunities for Iranians to travel in the 1970s. After1979 the migration was of refugees escaping from the new IslamicRepublic of Iran. The late twentieth-century diaspora is thereforea much more diverse phenomenon than the earlier one. This laterConclusion703"},{"pageNumber":723,"pageContent":"diasporic movement was rarely for trade. It was either for educationand career development—or for leaving alien regimes; theseincluded not only Iran, but also the increasing Islamization inPakistan, and the Black African policies in East Africa. In thetwentieth century for the most part Zoroastrians were migratingin order to settle, although some who came for higher educationintended to return, but finding career opportunities better in theWest, stayed on. Such students apart, this second migrationincluded families from the outset, or at least the families followedquickly once the husband had found accommodation. Themigrants were typically highly educated professionals. Those wholeft Iran were of two types: the wealthy, urbanized educatedand/or successful entrepreneurs, or young Zoroastrian men whoescaped through Afghanistan to Pakistan, or westwards throughTurkey. They had little or no hope of ever returning to theirfamilies. They were able to leave with little more than what theycould carry when travelling on foot. Considerable effort was putinto helping them by Zoroastrians in Pakistan, India, Canada, theUSA and the then embryonic WZO, first by supporting theirstatus as refugees, and then by finding accommodation and work,and helping them learn English.There was some chain migration, for example KarachiZoroastrians in Houston encouraged friends or family to jointhem, but more often it was nuclear families that travelled to theWest. They sometimes brought grandparents when they were set-tled. This second migration was therefore generally seen from theoutset as a move to settle. Generally the migrants were people whohad achieved a level of success in the old country in education andthe professions, or they were refugees, if not from persecution, atleast from social oppression, or the fear of persecution. Refugeesapart, most who migrated were young.The patterns of settlement are also different in the two diasporas.The early meetings in this second diaspora were simply socialoccasions, involving sharing traditional meals, comparing experi-ences and having the opportunity to use the old language andreminisce. But soon, especially in North America, concern grewabout transmitting their heritage to the next generation. Unlikethe first diaspora, members of the new groups in the West did notkeep so strictly within community boundaries socially. In NorthAmerica and Australia distances between cities are vast, and forConclusion704"},{"pageNumber":724,"pageContent":"several years there were few communal provisions, so that the newsettlers met fellow Zoroastrians infrequently. This was less true inBritain because of the older settlement which had grown out ofthe first diaspora; distances are not so great and Zoroastrians areconcentrated mostly in one city, London. But in the other threewestern countries, especially in the USA, there was considerableconcern that their young people, meeting few fellow Zoroastrians,would quickly assimilate and leave their heritage behind. Theimage of the old American melting-pot concerned many parents.The result was the quite rapid development of Associations, mostof which emphasized the importance of Zoroastrian religiouseducation from the outset. Newsletters became an importantmeans of communication concerning social functions—meals,nataks, festivals; lectures and conferences assumed more import-ance than in the old countries, for now the settlers no longer liveddaily in a Zoroastrian environment.The modern diaspora communities are also different in theirgeneral attitude to their new homeland. In the older diasporasthere was little or no question concerning their Zoroastrian identityin China or Africa. Their perspectives were directed back to Indiaand they worked within the compass of one empire. In the newdiasporas, especially in Canada and Australia, there is a strongsense of identifying with the new country, as Canadians orAussies. Whereas previously the self-identification was clear andsimple—they were Parsis—in the newer settlements there are vari-ous identities, not just as Iranian Zoroastrian or Parsi, but also asAmerican, or as Indian, or a Zoroastrian Aussie, or a Parsi Aussie.This does not necessarily indicate confusion over self-identity,rather a more complex understanding of a person’s place in thenew society. The community boundaries are not so clear.Involvement in inter-faith groups has substantial benefits: forexample, giving Zoroastrians (inter)national recognition as one ofthe great religions, and thereby decreasing the likelihood of themocking/patronizing/insulting media images that had previouslybeen experienced in each country. What has not been studied adequately, either with Zoroastrianism or any other religion, is the impact that participation in such inter-faith activities has on the community. For example, at a meeting of the directors of theZoroastrian Society of British Columbia, 20 January 1984, therewas a discussion about a forthcoming Jashan-Sadeh celebration,Conclusion705"},{"pageNumber":725,"pageContent":"which was to be attended by some inter-faith groups. The tradi-tional practice is to recite the Litany to the fire (Atash Nyaish) beforethe sacred fire. The record of the discussion reads:[ Mr X] said that in the English translation it describes fire as the son ofAhura Mazda. [Mrs Y] felt that some Muslim guests will also be com-ing and they will think that we are fire worshippers and it might not lookgood either. In short, finally, it was agreed that we should have the AtashNiyaesh as is except drop the word ‘worship’.What was agreed was to omit from the translation what in tradi-tional Zoroastrian belief and practice is a key word in the Avestanprayer. This debate was carried further at a subsequent EducationCommittee meeting, 11 March 1984. Agenda item 5 reads:The recitation of the Atesh Niyaesh and reading of same in English andPersian, especially the English version had upsetted [sic] some mem-bers. In the Atesh Niyaeash, it describes fire as the son of Ahura Mazda.Some Muslim guests were present and that too, was another reason.[Mr Z] said what is the purpose of having functions if the sole purposeis to eat, dance and go home? If some members became so upset withthe Atesh Niyaesh where fire is symbolically described as the son ofAhura Mazda, what would happen if we recite the Meher Yasht atMehergan? Do we abandon all prayers and for what reasons? Perhapsin future we should only recite selected verses from the Gathas.3When community members represent their Association in inter-faith groups, it is common for them to give an account of the reli-gion that is meant to convey a good impression to others, a ratheranodyne, or universalist, presentation. Such representatives, gate-keepers to the community, acquire status, and the account pro-duced for external religious groups can become the acceptedimage within the religion. This is not an entirely a new phenome-non. It was seen in the chapter on Zanzibar how Christian termslike ‘mass’ could be used to explain a Zoroastrian ceremony to anoutsider; or in the Pakistan chapter, how an account of Zoroastriantheology was conveyed in terms which would resonate withConclusion7063In both of these quotations the names have been omitted from the original to avoidgiving embarrassment. The Atash Nyaishis translated in M. N. Dhalla,The Nyaishes orZoroastrian Litanies, repr. New York, 1965, pp. 134–87. The Meher(orMithra)Yashtis a hymnto Mithra, which is fundamentally pre-Zoroastrian and deploys militaristic imagery. It isrecited at the festival of Mithra, which is still popular in Iran and is increasingly being cel-ebrated in the diasporic communities where Iranian Zoroastrians are influential. For atranslation see I. Gershevitch,The Avestan Hymn to Mithra, Cambridge, 1959, pp. 73–147."},{"pageNumber":726,"pageContent":"Muslims. Because inter-faith activities are more common thanthey were at the time of the first diaspora, this practice has becomemore frequent. One example is the emphasis in such meetings ofthe importance of good thoughts, good words and good deeds,but avoiding any reference to the purity laws as they relate to men-struation. The latter, it is commonly thought, would not give thepositive image that the simple threefold ethic does.Although Zoroastrians in almost all diaspora communities feela strong loyalty to that country (the possible exception is inGermany, for reasons discussed below), many nevertheless con-sider that they have faced racial discrimination. In all countriessurveyed, on average one in three respondents said that theybelieved they had faced racial discrimination. The perception ismore common in some countries, or some cities, than others, asdiscussed in Chapter 10. The typical and understandableresponse is for them to assert their Zoroastrian identity more, notless. The more alien the outside world is perceived to be, thestronger become the community boundaries. In contrast, the lesshostile and more accommodating the outside world is perceived tobe, the more multicultural the state, the more my informants areeager to assert their national identity. This I found to be especiallytrue in Canada. The high profile multicultural policy there meansthat more Zoroastrians assert their Canadian allegiance than doZoroastrians in some other western groups. This is demonstratedon Table 23(1), which shows that a substantial majority ofZoroastrians in Canada in general, particularly Toronto, identifiedtheir citizenship in terms of their country of residence, whereasin the USA the majority identified themselves as citizens oftheir country of birth. That is despite the fact that more of myCanadian respondents asserted that they had faced racial dis-crimination. In discussion they commented that the discrimina-tion was mostly faced in obtaining one’s first job, but once one wasseen to be good at it, then people were accepted. In Canada, aselsewhere, there is a sense that the Government is ahead of thegeneral public in liberal multiculturalism. In the 1990s in manycountries, Britain, Australia, Germany and France, for example,the strength of the right wing vote in elections has surprised manyobservers. It is mostly at that ‘popular’ level that my informantsbelieve that they have faced discrimination. It is not only discrim-ination or a perception of a hostile environment that reinforcesConclusion707"},{"pageNumber":727,"pageContent":"community boundaries. To some extent strong pressure toconform, as with the image of the American melting-pot, cantrigger a response of seeking to assert one’s traditional identity.There are further differences between the two eras of migrationand their diasporic forms. In the nineteenth century there was aclear recognition of the authority of Bombay. In the New Worldthat has been questioned, not least in North America.Exasperation grew as in successive World Zoroastrian Congressesdiaspora Zoroastrians sought guidance from Bombay on religiouspolicy and called for a world body, requests that were ignored bythe Bombay establishment. Eventually many of the highly edu-cated, leading professionals decided to take decisions for them-selves. Further, as noted in the America chapter, a number ofdiaspora Zoroastrians think the future of the religion rests not somuch with the ageing, diminishing community in the old countrywith its crumbling institutions, but with the dynamic communitiesin the West. That is not to deny that many in North Americarespect some traditional leaders, typically the Dasturs rather thanthe leaders of the BPP, and invite them over so that they can learnfrom them. In this respect the British community inclines some-what more to the older respect for Indian authorities. In HongKong, as an example of the older diaspora, though they takemany decisions for themselves, if there is a matter of religiousdebate then formal or informal advice is sought from Mumbai orNavsari.Whether or not the traditional authorities in the old country arerecognized, affection for the old country remains strong. It is notjust the elders who make periodic visits to India or Iran. Some ofthe youth I have spoken to react negatively to what they see as thedirt and corruption of India. But many more have told me howwarm the friendship and family ties are, and how they love theopportunity to visit the temples, especially the Atash Bahrams,Udwada in particular. In a research project of 240 structured in-depth interviews conducted in Britain by Dr Rashna Writerand myself, 88% of the youths questioned said that they had visitedIndia; 58% had made three or more visits. Whereas 41% of themsaid that they felt a stranger there, 55% of those questioned saidthat the visit gave them pleasure. One commented: ‘I like it there[ I was] taken straight into the center of the people.’ Another said‘I love India very much. Their character is similar to mine.’ A thirdConclusion708"},{"pageNumber":728,"pageContent":"one reported ‘I felt immediately at home...[it was a] very sim-ilar Parsi home to our own.’ I am reliably informed that in Britainthere is at the dawn of the new millennium an increased willing-ness on the part of the youth to look for a marriage partner inIndia. All of the people I have spoken to who have been on toursof Iran, especially the youth, are deeply moved by their encoun-ters with co-religionists, and the holy and historic sites they visit.The sense of roots is very strong among all with whom I have dis-cussed this. The video In the Footsteps of Our Forefathersmentioned inChapter 8, the record of a pilgrimage made by a group ofAmerican Zoroastrian youth across Iran, is but the (splendid) tipof an iceberg of deep love and pride in the ultimate homeland.Members of the new diasporas are more conscious of their Persianancestry than people in the old diasporas were. For the latter, Iranwas seen as a land of oppression, where Zoroastrians were poor anddowntrodden and had little contact with the outside world. Unlikemembers of the first diasporas, those in the New World may notenvisage returning to live in the old country, but it remains amajor factor in their self-understanding. Great pride is commonlyshown in the long history of their religion, a history which hasinvolved Zoroastrian influence on other religions, and there is alsopride in being a member of such a small community. Symbols ulti-mately deriving from the ancient Achaemenid palace ofPersepolis decorate the walls of homes and meeting places morenow than they did in the nineteenth century. Similarly, videos andtapes of prayers evoke powerful and treasured historical memor-ies and emotions. A popular tie with the Persian past is thePersian epic, the Shah Name, the ‘Epic of the Kings’. This muchloved text, composed in the tenth century from ancient myths andlegends once recited by court and village minstrels, has beendescribed as ‘an amalgamation of the Persian equivalents ofchapters in the book of Genesis, the Odyssey, Paradise Lost,Chaucer’s Canterbury Tales and Shakespeare’.4Beloved in Parsi,and especially Iranian Zoroastrian, homes with its stories ofancient Persian heroes and villains, it has inspired countlessPersian miniatures, and its tales are related by parents to childrenand at Sunday schools. It plays a role in the Zoroastrian diasporaConclusion7094R. Levy,The Epic of the Kings: Shah-nama, the National Epic of Persia by Ferdowsi, London,1967, p. xix.

Any future survey should focus more on these links withthe Persian homeland than did my 1980s questionnaire. Basedentirely on anecdotal evidence, my impression is that many youngpeople have a stronger emotional tie to the old country, either Persiaor India, than many of the innovative 1960s pioneers who left theirpast behind as they flew away. It seems to me that many youngZoroastrians in the western world find an even greater fulfilment intheir visits to their roots than do earlier settlers. But that emotionaltie is not likely to lead many to return to the old country to live.In the nineteenth-century diaspora communities religious prac-tice followed as closely as possible the patterns set in India. In thesecond diaspora there remains a strong desire to maintain the oldtraditions but there are more debates on what changes are help-ful, or necessary, in the New World. The old ‘rote learning’ isquestioned by many and there is a growing emphasis, particularlyin North America, on understanding the prayers and rituals. Thenature of the priesthood is also changing. In several nineteenth-century diaspora communities, full-time traditional priests wereemployed. Most of the practising priests in the modern diasporaare highly educated individuals in the secular world but not manyare fully trained in priestly work. In India since the nineteenthcentury concern has been expressed about the level of seculareducation for the priesthood, and in many quarters there is a per-ception that priests do not command the respect that they used to.This attitude has been manifest in some of the discussions of theold diaspora communities, such as Zanzibar. In the modern dia-spora, the education and the professional standing of the priestscommonly leads to more individual respect, mixed with gratitudeto them for giving their spare time to serve the communities. Onthe one hand, there is recognition that rituals must be differentbecause of the absence of consecrated temples, and with thespeed of life in the West, there is less time for lengthy rites. On theother hand, there is a wish to preserve as many of the traditionsas possible. The sanctuaries in prayer rooms in western countriesfollow the architectural structure of the sanctuary in the old coun-try. They reflect the general layout, with tiled floors, a largeafringan5—usually brought from India—for the fire, a bell for useConclusion7105A large, usually silver, object that outsiders commonly call a ‘fire altar’."},{"pageNumber":730,"pageContent":"in the ceremonies and symbolic swords decorating the wall behindthe fire as seen from the entrance. Only one prayer room in thewestern world differs strongly from the general pattern, that in thepurpose-built structure in Los Angeles. But even there, Iranianthemes are strong, for it is a community with a substantial pro-portion of Iranian Zoroastrians. Naficy, whose article was dis-cussed in Chapter 1, emphasizes the importance of smell, tasteand touch in recreating the nostalgic past. That expresses well thebeliefs and practices in western Zoroastrian religious meetings, theconsistent use of sandalwood on the fire, the importance attachedto having a meal at functions, the saying of the sudreandkustiprayers, and the warmth with which people greet each other. Thefestivals,gahambars, had become less prominent in India, but wherethere are Iranian Zoroastrians these seasonal festivals havebecome part of the annual cycle in most western diasporicgroups—as Naficy noted in his article. This nostalgic past is notsomething enjoyed only by the elders, but by the youth also, forthe structure of the prayer room, the symbols, the smell, taste andtouch together create a Zoroastrian world with which many wantto identify because for them religion is a clear marker of theiridentity. Some may not value the ethnic markers (such as nataks) astheir parents do, but religion for many of them is what makesthem what they are.There are other differences between the old and the new dia-sporas. Although very few Zoroastrians in the New World haveengaged in national politics as those in the older diaspora did,they nevertheless have more social contact with the ‘outsideworld’. It has been rare for Zoroastrian groups to seek governmentfunding for minority groups (the North London and Sydney com-munities apart). There has been relatively little contact with otherIndian religious groups (Sydney and the North LondonAssociation are the exceptions) but the Zoroastrians are againinteracting more with the wider society, with other Canadians,Americans or Aussies than did their forebears. Indeed, unlike peo-ple in the old diaspora, Zoroastrians in the New World are keento assert that they are American, Canadian, Aussie or British.They are happy to see their identity as multifaceted. This is lesstrue of Iranian Zoroastrians. Their Iranian-ness remains pivotalfor them (see Table 23). They, more than Parsis, are ready tosocialize and observe the festivals with fellow migrants from theConclusion711"},{"pageNumber":731,"pageContent":"old country, for example celebrating No Ruz with Iranian Muslims,Baha’is, etc., in Hamburg, California and British Columbia. It willbe interesting to see how their second and third generations reactto these identities.Arising mainly from the work of Ali Jafarey and theZarathushtrian Assembly discussed in Chapter 8, a number ofIranian Shia Muslims have been quietly initiated intoZoroastrianism, particularly in California, but in many othercountries too, for example in Latin America and Europe. Myinformant tells me that he personally has initiated over 200 peo-ple in an eighteen-month period during 2002–3 in Britain. TheseIranians understand that the Iranian President, Rafsanjani, hasasserted that it is no crime for Iranians to return to the religion oftheir forefathers. In part their Zoroastrian initiation is said to be areaction against what they see as ‘the Islam of Khomeini’. Therehave been a few Muslims from Pakistan who have been initiated,but greater caution is felt necessary in these cases because there isnot the same network of contacts as there is among Iranians, toenable the checking of contacts’ backgrounds and motives. Someof these individuals have become members of WZO, but report asense of a lack of warmth in their reception. There are few con-tacts with Zoroastrian House in London. In Britain as elsewhere(notably California, Brazil, Germany, and Sweden) it is essentiallyan Iranian network. At the time of writing there have been no ini-tiations of Turks or Kurds. They do, however, have links withgroups in the old Soviet Union, especially in Tajikistan. Becausethese groups wish to grow quietly, in part so they do not alienatethe mullahs or the Iranian government, it is not easy to give a pro-file of them. My British informant tells me that he has initiatedpeople from the age of 15 to 60, and that the majority are men.Although a number are medical personnel there is no clear pat-tern of educational or social levels among the initiates. He has notyet initiated people of ‘Anglo-Saxon’ ancestry, but he would do soif he could be sure of the warmth in their heart for the pure teach-ings of the Gathas. These groups bring together a number ofthemes in this book: the very powerful sense of the Persian herit-age among Iranians; international networking; the emergence oflarge numbers and groups of peoples in the former Soviet Unionclaiming Zoroastrian ancestry; the influence of Jafarey; the Parsi-Iranian Zoroastrian tensions; the celebration of No Ruz with Conclusion712"},{"pageNumber":732,"pageContent":"fellow Iranians, Zoroastrian and non-Zoroastrian, and the divers-ity of understandings of just who is, and can be, a Zoroastrian.Factors Affecting Zoroastrian DiasporasGeographic factorsIn the Introduction the question was asked, ‘How different is itbeing a Zoroastrian in Los Angeles or London, Hong Kong orSydney?’ There are clear differences, some apparently simple, yetwith profound consequences. For example, the fact that in HongKong people live in reasonably close proximity means that theycan, and most do, attend the Friday night dinners. This old dia-spora has the wealth to be able to hold weekly dinners, some paidfor by long established Trusts, others through the wealth of theAssociation. The Zoroastrians meet regularly in a pleasantZoroastrian environment. They also have the wealth to employ afull-time priest, so that the old traditions are preserved. But, as inthe old country, there is little or no religious education. Peopleknow who they are—Parsis—and see no need for studies of thereligion, which in their opinion commonly causes divisions.In the USA, religion has a high public profile even though it isofficially a secular nation. The religious nature of AmericanAssociations is evident. There are also important geographicalfactors. The distances between Associations are huge, and evenwithin one Association people are scattered over a large area. Theyoung may meet a fellow Zoroastrian once a month but Americanpeers daily. In North America children are encouraged at schoolto ask questions. Because of the fear of assimilation, there hasfrom the inception of Associations been an emphasis on religiouseducation so that the young people know who they are, what theirheritage is and what makes them different in order that they mayresist the pressures of assimilation. In Karachi, religion has a highprofile because of the government policies regarding Islamization.There also the level of religious education and practice amongZoroastrians is high. In Melbourne, in contrast, where there is nocentre for important rituals, the emphasis in the files of theAssociation is that it is a cultural body and it was explicitly agreedthat the president need not be religious. For them, one can be aZoroastrian and an atheist.Conclusion713"},{"pageNumber":733,"pageContent":"Different local Associations in different parts of the world aresubject to external local influences. There are relatively fewIranians in many countries, for example, Britain and Australia, andnone in the old diasporas of Hong Kong and East Africa,whereas in Los Angeles and Vancouver there are many Iranians,both Zoroastrians, Muslims and others. The growth of theZarathushtrian Assembly in Los Angeles is not surprising, asCalifornia is one of the states in which new religious movementsflourish; some are based on interpretations of ancient Asian tradi-tions, and some not. The presence of so many Iranians belong-ing to different religions yet all very conscious of theirIranian-ness results in a large festival gathering, musical evenings,access to videos and a television station, which all reinforce the tiesto the old country. Religious communities are like chameleons:they change their ‘colour’ in different environments. Just asChristianity is different in, say, Ireland and Africa, so alsoZoroastrian groups have to take account of the local situation iftheir tradition is to be meaningful to them, to the young especially,in different social and cultural situations. It is inevitable thatZoroastrianism will be seen differently in, say, Los Angeles, a mod-ern western city with many new religious movements, and manyIranians, than in, say, Mombasa or Hong Kong. On that axis,London would be at the mid-point. Plotting each city on the axismay be fraught with difficulties, but an axis exists.The size of communitiesThe size of the communities to a large extent determines religiouspractice. Toronto, for example, has the largest Zoroastriancommunity in the New World. Toronto Zoroastrians have beenable, with substantial financial support from the OntarioGovernment, to establish impressive facilities, both in terms oftheir building and with human resources to run Sunday schoolson different sides of the city.6In France and Germany, by con-trast, numbers are so small that there is no establishedAssociation, no building, no possibility of Sunday school classes,because there are only a few families in any one city. Maintaininga religious identity in such a context is very difficult. In Germany,Conclusion7146At the time of writing there is a move to have another building, this time a consecratedtemple."},{"pageNumber":734,"pageContent":"for example, at the time of writing there was no Association andZoroastrians met for a meal once a year on No Ruz in the homeof a Parsi in Bonn. In France numbers are so small that inter-marriage is the norm. The survey showed that in the ‘scatteredgroups’ in any country, Britain, Canada or the USA, the level ofreligious practice is lower than in established centres; for example,fewer say their prayers daily and intermarriage is more common.Another feature of scattered groups, commonly neglected byscholars, are the emotional difficulties, especially loneliness, facedby many who have migrated to a country where they are unlikelyto meet fellow Zoroastrians (or Hindus, Gujaratis, etc.).Local factorsThere are other differences between centres in any one countrywhich are due to internal factors (as opposed to the externalfactors discussed above). In the United States, for example, thereis a marked difference between the communities in Chicago andHouston. Consistently in the survey the former was found to bemore Liberal and the latter more Orthodox.7One major factor inthis difference of emphasis is that Houston has the highest pro-portion of Zoroastrians from Pakistan compared with any otherAssociation in North America. In the survey, Zoroastrians fromKarachi were found to be more traditional in the diaspora thanpeople from Bombay. In Houston this was in large measure aresult of the work of one particularly kindly lady helping fellowKarachi-ites to migrate, in effect triggering chain migration. Itwas also the result of the influence of some of the early leaders. Itis, in my experience, difficult to exaggerate the impact of keyleaders in the early days of an Association. The danger withundertaking survey questionnaires is that the key details can belost in the study of general patterns (which is why I thought itessential to visit all the centres I wrote about). The early settlersdeveloped strategies for settlement and supported new arrivals,not necessarily with money, but with finding accommodation andor/work, and above all with friendship.Vancouver is a good illustration of a distinctive Zoroastrian com-munity shaped by local factors. Unusually for a ZoroastrianAssociation, the number of Parsis and of Iranian Zoroastrians isConclusion7157See further chs. 17 and 18 in Selected Works, pp. 367–430."},{"pageNumber":735,"pageContent":"approximately equal. (In California there are people from bothgroups, but the Associations tend to be predominantly one or theother.) The nature of the Vancouver community was mouldedsignificantly by one individual, the late Jamshed Pavri. He con-stantly emphasized the importance of both groups being repres-ented on committees. The Association’s newsletter includedmaterial in both English and Farsi. The calendar of events fromearly times took care to include popular festivals from both com-munities; lectures in English were often translated into Farsi asthey took place. Not least, he had friends in both groups. From the ‘grapevine’ I understand that there were times when this unity was strained, but at the time of writing the Associationremains united. This is in total contrast to New York, where twoformal Associations resulted from the breakaway of IranianZoroastrians. Those tensions are easing, but the two Associationsremain separate.London is different again. Because of the long history of theAssociation it has developed some substantial resources, notably alarge house with a library, and a funeral ground. Also because ofthat long history there is a broader demographic picture: there arethird-generation Zoroastrians, more older people, and morebabies. Physically and emotionally the ZTFE is nearer to Indiathan the North American Associations are. An important factor isthe higher proportion of East African Parsis, ‘twice migrants’. Inall studies of East African Asian migrants, be they Sikh or Hindu,they have been found to be more traditional than people migrat-ing directly from India. The East African Zoroastrians are alsomore traditional and they had a major influence on theAssociation in the 1990s. Zoroastrians in London are conscious ofliving in a major international centre of banking and commerce,with extensive international communications and potential fortravel. These were some of the reasons why the WZO was startedin London. The involvement in inter-faith activities in the 1990shas also had considerable impact. It has resulted in Zoroastrianismbeing recognized as one of the nine world religions in Britain andits leaders are invited to royal and state functions, to BuckinghamPalace and to receptions at the Prime Minister’s home. Theopportunity to project an important political image was seizedwith the centenary of the elections of Naoroji and Bhownaggreeto Parliament. Such recognition increases pride in the community,Conclusion716"},{"pageNumber":736,"pageContent":"especially when contrasted with earlier media images ofZoroastrianism as a new cult.Political factorsIn Chapter 1 the question was asked, ‘What is the impact on thereligious communities of the policies of the governments in thenew lands?’ National and local government policies do have aneffect on communities. Because of the access route to a GreenCard in the United States, the Associations there are composed ofextremely highly educated people, typically scientists, whereas inHong Kong the proportion of people pursuing higher education,though growing among the young, is less, and there are few scient-ists. In Chapter 10 different patterns of belief and practice wereseen to be associated with differences in education. Whereas theGovernment of the United States has relatively few nationwidemulticultural policies (the power of the market place determineshow people fare), in Britain, Canada and, later, Australia there arestrong government multicultural policies intended to encouragereligious groups to preserve their heritage.In Britain, schools are required to teach religious education(RE). The basis of the curriculum is expected to be Christianity,though ‘World Religions’ or ‘Comparative Religion’ is taught inreligious studies programmes in many schools. The aim is torespect, indeed celebrate, difference. Of course, there are stateand religious schools where this policy is not pursued, and thereare right-wing conservative, religious groups which oppose this,but the education policy at the dawn of the millennium is toencourage knowledge about, and understanding of, the religionspractised in Britain. The consequence is that young Zoroastriansneed information and resources to meet questions at school onwhat Zoroastrianism is, does and teaches. Further, parents areaware that at school their children are going to learn aboutChristianity, so it is important that they learn about their own reli-gion. ZTFE has also to be ready for requests from schools for vis-its or information.In Australia there has been funding for the teaching of minor-ity languages. The message given by the national Governmentabout the place, status and recognition afforded to religiousminorities can affect the attitudes of the general public, eventhough there may be protests and prejudice from some quarters.Conclusion717"},{"pageNumber":737,"pageContent":"Religion is not as highly profiled as it is in American society, or asin British education, so although in Sydney (and to a lesser extentMelbourne) there have been Sunday schools, the Associations donot emphasize religion or religious education as other communit-ies in the New World do. In the records there is an account of ayoung Toronto Zoroastrian visiting Australia and commentingexplicitly on how little religion is emphasized there in comparisonwith Toronto. (The self-perception of the Association as a culturalbody was noted above.)German government policy at the time this research wasundertaken (the policy changed in 2000) was that all Germansautomatically became citizens when they ‘returned’ from EasternEurope or Russia; but non-Germans did not become citizens,even if their parents had been born in Germany. Foreignersremained ‘guest workers’. There was no assumption that theimmigrants would assimilate, and there were few German multi-cultural policies. The schools taught only Catholic or ProtestantChristianity, and there was little attempt to teach about other reli-gions. All my German informants said that they believed thatthey and their religion were seen as foreign. They were generallyleft in peace by the Government but quite a number of youngerpeople told me of their experiences of violence. The GermanZoroastrians were hesitant to undertake the considerable paper-work necessary to register as a religious association, and fearedthey would be seen as a new religious movement, which com-monly face hostility. In France, in contrast, government policyassumes that settlement leads to citizenship and assimilation.Canada, Australia and the USA all see immigrants (in con-trolled numbers) as potentially beneficial to the country. Since the1960s, Britain has publicly asserted a closed-door policy. The term‘economic migrant’ is used by the British media and politicians asa derogatory label—which is ironic in view of the British invasionand suppression oflands lived in by the traditional peoples of the three countries discussed here, and elsewhere.Government polices on immigration and education do, therefore,impact on the life of religious groups. What still remain to beimplemented in many countries are policies on medical care,police and social services that recognize differences, and there is little training of staff in the implications of religious and cul-tural differences for their work. Simplistic and false stereotypesConclusion718"},{"pageNumber":738,"pageContent":"continue to affect policy in many areas in most countries studied here.Distinctive Zoroastrian Diasporic FeaturesHow typical or different are Zoroastrians when compared withother South Asians in the western countries studied here?NumbersA simple and obvious factor that has considerable impact is therelative size of the religious groups. Because Muslims, for exam-ple, have greater numbers and some wealthy sponsors from theMiddle East, they are able to press governments in various coun-tries to take account of their needs. They also have the numbersand funds to obtain greater resources, for example to have theirown schools. This is never likely to be something Zoroastrians inthe diaspora could achieve. In no country are Zoroastrians likelyto be able to build such splendid temples as Hindus have inLondon (Neasden) and in the United States. In Britain, one sig-nificant difference between Zoroastrians and other South Asiansis that whereas the majority of the latter came as manual workers,Zoroastrians have almost all come as highly educated profession-als. The second generation of British South Asians has a high pro-portion of their youth pursuing higher education, those of Indianancestry having a greater proportion of their young going to uni-versity than do the Whites. But there remain areas of educationaland social deprivation, especially in some inner cities, which affectSouth Asians in Britain. Parsis were and continue to be highlyeducated. In North America and Australia entry permits havelong tended to favour the well educated, so the South Asian dia-spora communities in these three countries are different from thosein Britain, but even so the Zoroastrians are yet more educated.The fact that the general population in all western countries knowfar less, indeed most know nothing, about the Zoroastrians canlead to suspicion, even mocking, and has done so in each of the dia-sporic communities studied in the New World. The case is differentwith Hinduism, Islam and Sikhism. Whereas some communitiestend to congregate in one particular area, Zoroastrians have notdone that, so that in each city they are more widely scattered thanConclusion719"},{"pageNumber":739,"pageContent":"other groups, a fact which has increased the difficulty of organiz-ing functions. Hindus and Muslims in the diaspora can reasonablyeasily meet co-religionists in a way that Zoroastrians, especially inCanada, the United States and Australia, cannot. In the case ofZoroastrianism, there are perhaps two diasporas, Iranian andParsi. The Muslim diasporas obviously include many ethnicitiesor nationalities, and there are caste and regional differences withinthe Hindu diasporas; but in many places the numbers of those‘subgroups’ are sufficient to enable them to have their separatecentres, temples or mosques. This has rarely happened with theZoroastrians, so that religious centres have to cater for disparategroups, notably Iranian and Parsi, or Orthodox and Reform, asonce was true of the early Indian migrants.Gender issuesAnother distinctive feature of the Zoroastrian diaspora is the roleof women. Zoroastrians have commonly emphasized, with goodcause, that men and women are equal in Zoroastrian belief andpractice: their private and public acts of worship and their dutiesare the same; initiation and funeral rites are the same. The implica-tions of the purity laws complicate the picture for women, but thetraditional view is that because women have the key role in thebirth of another member of Ahura Mazda’s army their role isespecially significant, and the purity laws are a consequence ofthis special status. Throughout recorded history Zoroastrianwomen have had greater protection and rights in law than inmany other cultures. In the diaspora this equality is reflectedin the role of women in the various Associations. There have beenwomen presidents, for example Dr (Mrs) Kutar in Britain (both ofZTFE and WZO) and Dr Dolly Dastoor, the second president ofFEZANA. Only Hong Kong has been slow in permitting womentrustees. One dimension that has been seriously lacking in studiesof Zoroastrianism (as in other academic fields) is the role ofwomen in the religious upbringing of children. In the Sunday (orFriday) schools I have visited there are more women than menteachers. Staying in numerous homes around the diaspora, I haveobserved that it is the mothers (or grandparents where they arepresent) who take a leading role in teaching their children aboutthe religion, whether it is telling stories from the religion, e.g. theShah Name, to the children in bed at night, or in arranging naujotesConclusion720"},{"pageNumber":740,"pageContent":"and weddings. The important domestic role is probably shared bymany South Asian communities, but not so the public role. Thus farthere have been no Zoroastrian women priests, but at YouthCongresses the women have argued for them, so far without success.Demographic featuresAn important factor in the Zoroastrian diaspora is that, for Parsisat least, there is a huge consciousness that numbers in the old coun-try are diminishing, whereas in the diaspora they are increasing.There is a greater likelihood, therefore, of the diaspora acquiringa leading role in the future of the religion. Hindu and Muslim dias-poras are important, and in some cases provide funds to help peo-ple in the old country, but it is not likely, for example, that Hindusin America will be the key leaders in the future of Hinduism; butthis could be the case for Indian Zoroastrians. One factor in theintensity of the community’s debates is the fear that if the wrongpolicy decision is taken on key issues, it could precipitate the dis-appearance of the religion. If Hinduism were to disappear fromthe American continent it would be a tragic loss, but it would notbe likely to produce a crisis in the total Hindu world.IntermarriageIn comparison with other South Asian groups Zoroastrians prob-ably experience more intermarriage than others do. This is a mat-ter of grave concern to most Parsis in India, and indeed toOrthodox Zoroastrians in the West. In each chapter of this bookit has been seen to be a subject of intense and bitter debate.Research suggests that it is not as common as the Orthodox fear.8Nevertheless, it is a growing fear, and a growing phenomenon.Intermarriage often causes family distress, but it is rare for a fam-ily to reject someone totally for marrying out. Nor are there anyenforced (in contrast to arranged) marriages. With varyingdegrees of regret, most diaspora Zoroastrians see intermarriage asinevitable because of the small size of some communities, withfew opportunities to meet a suitable partner. It is also seen as anoutcome of increased westernization, which in other ways hasbenefited the community. Iranians oppose out marriage yet more.Conclusion7218See Huzan Kharas, ‘Intermarriage of Zoroastrian Women in Bombay’, Ph.D. thesis,Manchester, 1993 (unpublished). Some of my Mumbai informants, however, assert that thephenomenon has increased significantly since Huzan wrote her thesis."},{"pageNumber":741,"pageContent":"Zoroastrians and non-Zoroastrian academicsA marked feature of the Zoroastrian community is the generallypositive relations they have with outside scholars who study theirhistory and religion. This is true in the old country, and especiallyin the New World. In Britain, Canada and America outside aca-demics have often been invited to deliver lectures; their books arehoused in Zoroastrian libraries, private or communal. Indeed,many western academics have had some of their research sup-ported financially by Zoroastrians, as I have, with no stringsattached as to the subject matter or treatment (save only theinstances mentioned in Chapter 1). Some Iranians have expressedregret that western academics focus too much on Pahlavi (to themmedieval, superstitious) or ritual texts, and by emphasizing the tra-ditional teachings on evil make Zoroastrians sound dualistic. Inrecent years, however, there have been fewer invitations to non-Zoroastrian academics to give lectures at their meetings inCanada and the USA, but the positive relationship generally con-tinues. This is especially true in Britain, as indicated, for example,by the funding by the Zarthoshty brothers of a post in ZoroastrianStudies at the School of Oriental Studies, London University, in2001. ZTFE are happy to organize functions to launch new booksby academics and they and WZO continue to invite outside schol-ars to lecture at appropriate functions. There has been nothingequivalent to the death threats some of my colleagues in Sikh andIslamic studies have faced.Zoroastrians as a Typical DiasporaZoroastrians and the old countryDespite the views of Safran and Cohen discussed in Chapter 1,namely that Parsis do not constitute a diaspora, the argument inthis book is that in many ways they represent a typical form of thisphenomenon. Indeed, they make an exceptionally good test casefor study. There is a strong sense of the homeland. This is notablyIran, but also for some Parsis India is a homeland, in addition to,not instead of, Iran. There are many ways in which this ultimatePersian ancestry is manifested. Some of these are: the emotionalties to the homeland; the assertion that Zoroastrians are the trueor original Persians; the wish to go on pilgrimage; the evocation inConclusion722"},{"pageNumber":742,"pageContent":"home and temple of motifs in the architecture and its decoration;the invocation of Persian ancestry as being their distinguishingfeature among India’s many millions; the love of the tales from theShah Name, the great Persian epic; the theme of the homeland invideos and novels. All these, and more, combine to giveZoroastrians a particularly strong sense of a homeland, one thatmay be difficult to settle in for political reasons, but to which manytravel when possible. That homeland lies at the core of their iden-tity. These features certainly fulfil the criteria demanded byTölölyan, Clifford, Anthias, Brah and Vertovec.The Zoroastrian sense of historyZoroastrians of any age, and in whichever country they live, havein my experience a strong sense of their great history. Not every-one knows the scholarly details, but there is pride in some keymoments: the founder of the Persian Empire, Cyrus the Great,pursuing what was then a unique policy of religious tolerance, forexample, in allowing the Jews to return home from their imposedexile in Babylonia, and giving them royal and financial support forthe rebuilding of the temple in Jerusalem. Most Zoroastrians areaware, in general terms, of the many theories of Zoroastrianinfluence on biblical teachings.9There is also general awareness ofboth the contribution of Zoroastrians to modern Iran, notablythat of Farhang Mehr, and of the Parsi leaders to Indian industry,banking, politics, law, medicine, science and arts. A pride in therecord of achievements, and of the common origin of all in Iran,is a strong dimension in the Zoroastrian persona. In 2002 aremarkable book was published, edited by two Bombay Parsiwomen, Pheroza J. Godfrej and Firoza Punthakey Mistree,A Zoroastrian Tapestry. This huge volume (762 pages in large formatwith lavish illustrations) with contributions from thirteen westernacademics and sixteen Zoroastrians, covers the history, religionand secular culture in Iran, India and the West for a lay reader,Zoroastrian or non-Zoroastrian. In the foreword the editorsemphasize the sense of Zoroastrian history:Being distinct from the mainstream cultures of Hinduism, Buddhism,Christianity and Islam, the question is often posed ‘Who are theConclusion7239See my Selected Works, chs. 2–4. As I was drafting this piece for the first time, a splendidvolume arrived in the post produced by FEZANA and edited by Roshan Rivetna, producedspecifically for introducing the outside world to Zoroastrians. Pages 22–9 emphasize thisprecise point, namely the influence that Zoroastrianism has exerted over other religions."},{"pageNumber":743,"pageContent":"Zoroastrians?’ To understand the spirit and ethos of the Zoroastrianpeople it is important to go back three thousand five hundred years tothe life and times of the Prophet Spitaman Zarathushtra who was thefounder of the oldest revealed religion—Zoroastrianism....Integral tothe understanding of the Zoroastrian faith is the era of the great imper-ial dynasties of the Achaemenians, Parthians and Sasanians each ofwhom played a seminal role in establishing Zoroastrianism as the faithof their empires...[It] had some degree of influence on religions suchas Judaism, Christianity and Islam.Zoroastrian loyaltiesMost studies of diasporas emphasize the tension between loyaltiesto the old country and to the new. This is not as evident amongZoroastrians as among other groups, because it has long been partof their tradition to be loyal to the country in which they live andto the ruler of that country. In Indo-Pakistan wars there have beenParsi generals on both sides; at the times of tension in East Africa,those Zoroastrians who stayed publicly affirmed strong loyaltyto the new government. Those who could not make such anaffirmation left. During the two world wars Parsis gave money andlives to the allied cause. There has as yet been little demand forsuch loyalty to be shown in Canada, the USA and Australia, butin the respective chapters the theme of loyalty has emergedclearly. Parsis are devoted to the old country, and loyal to the new.They do not have the tensions between loyalties that some writershave suggested are characteristic of diaspora groups. The IranianZoroastrians, refugees from the old country, have a particularlystrong loyalty to Iran, its history, language, music and food. Theytoo appreciate their freedom and security in the New World,though they fear the dilution of moral and family values.Troubled relationships?One dimension most diaspora scholars refer to is the diasporic senseof what Cohen calls a ‘troubled relationship with host soci-eties’; Clifford speaks of an ‘ongoing history of displacement, suf-fering, adaptation or resistance’. As indicated in various chapters,approximately one in three Zoroastrians consider that they haveexperienced racial prejudice. More Canadian Zoroastrians saidthat they had experienced racial discrimination but there respond-ents affirmed it was only occasional and insubstantial (usuallyin gaining one’s first job), whereas in Britain, especially London,Conclusion724"},{"pageNumber":744,"pageContent":"it was thought to be more frequent and substantial especially,in employment and education. In my interviews in Germany(where the survey was not circulated) all but one of my informantsstated that they faced racial discrimination frequently and substan-tially. There is, therefore, for a significant minority a sense ofdistance from certain sections of the wider population, despite theirown loyalty. The respondents who most frequently said that theyfaced discrimination were those born in the West, the highlyeducated and those successful in their careers. Subsequent to thissurvey there has been a political swing to the Right in most ofthe countries studied; one might therefore anticipate that morerespondents would state that they had experienced discrimination.Transnational networksInternational interaction between diaspora groups is another fea-ture commonly emphasized by writers in this field. This is cer-tainly a feature of the modern Zoroastrian diaspora. The WorldCongresses, the international Youth Congresses, the participationin the national conferences of others (notably in America), theInternet, the moves for a world body, all involve close inter-national relations. A Zoroastrian World Chamber of Commercehas been established, but at the time of writing it is effective inNorth America rather than elsewhere.10In India there are strong butinformal economic networks. It is, in my experience, at the informallevel where networking is at its strongest among Zoroastrians, withcontact by telephone, letters, travel and in social gatherings pro-viding mutual support and encouragement. The emphasis in the-oretical studies on global networks as a characteristic of diasporacommunities is, in my opinion, questionable. Such networks existin modern societies but they were far more difficult to establish inearlier times. In the first Zoroastrian diaspora, for example, therewas relatively little contact between the diaspora groups; commu-nications were mostly back to India. There have also been, as wasseen in the chapter on East Africa, individuals or families who hadlittle contact with fellow Zoroastrians. In earlier times runners andhorse riders provided some communication, but networking onany scale is surely a modern phenomenon more a product oftechnology than of diasporic expereince.Conclusion72510See e.g. the report on the World Zarathushti Chamber of Commerce with its variouschapters, FEZANA Journal, Summer 2002, p. 25. A chapter was opened in Delhi in 2003."},{"pageNumber":745,"pageContent":"Zoroastrianism and a Typology of DiasporasCohen’s typology of diasporas was discussed in Chapter 1. Eachtype is evident in the Zoroastrian world. The victim diaspora isreflected in the origins of the Parsi community seeking a new landof religious freedom in India because of Islamic oppression intheir own country. It is also found in modern history, notably inthe Iranian Zoroastrian diaspora following the fall of the Shah in1979, but also in the departure of most Zoroastrians from EastAfrica in the face of Africanization in Kenya, Uganda andTanzania and the revolution in both Aden and Zanzibar. It mayalso be represented by the Zoroastrians who have migrated fromPakistan in the face of growing Islamization, and the strength ofMuslim militants there. Cohen’s second type, a labour diaspora, isperhaps the least common among Zoroastrians, unless under histerm ‘labour’ includes the many scientists, businessmen and pro-fessionals who have pursued their careers in the West. There hasnot been a labour migration comparable to those he points to, theIndian ‘coolie’ migration to build the railway line in East Africa,or of workers in the fields in Trinidad and elsewhere. Similarly,Zoroastrians have not in modern times had an imperial diaspora,though such may be suggested for Zoroastrian armies in theMiddle East and India during Iran’s imperial history. The culturaldiaspora is evident in all the communities I have visited, especiallythose in the New World. The Zoroastrian example reinforces thepoint Cohen made, namely that the same community can embodymore than one type of diaspora group, and that diasporas changeover time.Several writers on diaspora studies imply that a diaspora is not ashort-lived phenomenon, but it is also suggested that after a few gen-erations it may no longer be a diaspora. The Parsi experience forover a thousand years in India suggests that there is no such timelimit. A community remains a diaspora as long as the diasporicframe of mind and social structure continues. The facts that Parsisin India have continued to retain a strong sense of a different home-land from where they live; that they have sought to visit Iran whenpossible; that they evoke collective memories of Persia throughmotifs in temples and homes, the campaigns on behalf of oppressedco-religionists in the old country. All these features indicate that theParsis remain a diaspora in India, even after a millennium.Conclusion726"},{"pageNumber":746,"pageContent":"Common Features of MaturationLeadershipZoroastrians share many experiences with other diasponic com-munities in their process of maturation in the West. The emer-gence of a new leadership is an obvious example. People areelected to represent an Association to the outside world, generallybecause they are good at external communications, not just in lan-guage but also in style. They thereby acquire significant statuswithin the community. Sometimes such people are not typical ofthe wider membership, which can lead to challenges for leader-ship. As people feel discriminated against in the outside world intheir desired promotion (in social, political or economic spheres),so the drive for community leadership can be stronger. It is notcommon for priests to acquire such a role among Zoroastrians,but it does happen. The most active priest in Britain, ErvadRustom Bhedwar, for example, is on the Managing Committee atZTFE precisely because a religious contribution to discussions isvalued. He has also been asked to take significant external roles.The Summer 2002 issue of the American FEZANA Journalproudly gives details of his participation in the Day of Prayer forWorld Peace called at the Vatican by the Pope ( pp. 12 f.). But inthe older diasporas, the priests were seen as undertaking only aliturgical role and were not therefore expected to be prominent incommunal social or political affairs. As was seen in the chapter onEast Africa, they are sometimes viewed as mere labourers and notgiven great respect.LanguageLanguage is a problem that Zoroastrians share with other SouthAsian diasporas. The Iranian Zoroastrians commonly speak inFarsi inside the family, so that the young grow up knowing the lan-guage. But few Parsis use Gujarati extensively in their home,except when conversing with grandparents. Some (bawdy) jokesand family memories may be discussed in Gujarati, but the mainlanguage of communication is English, and, they believe, properlyso since they are living in the English-speaking world. But in vari-ous communities, Parsis lament the lack of knowledge of Gujaratiamong the young. Some Associations have tried teaching GujaratiConclusion727"},{"pageNumber":747,"pageContent":"at Sunday schools, but an hour or so a month or even a week isnot found adequate for the child to develop a working knowledge,especially of the written form of the language. However, even inMumbai Gujarati is not such a crucial language as Farsi is to theIranian Zoroastrians. It is, after all, a language acquired aftermigration to India and was not part of their ancient heritage. Butin losing this linguistic facility, some parents fear that the youngare missing out on an important part of their culture, from the funofnataksto the history of the religion and other cultural featuresof their history in Gujarat.BoundariesIt is common in studies of diaspora groups to refer to ‘patrollingcommunity boundaries’. In Zoroastrian communities around theworld the debate is whether outsiders can cross the boundary andbecome Zoroastrian. The place of intermarried spouses and theiroffspring has been a recurring theme throughout this book.Intermarriage was not an issue in Iran, for any Muslim seeking tobecome a Zoroastrian would have been harshly punished, evenexecuted, for so doing. The matter came to a head in Bombay inthe early twentieth century when Tata married a French ladywho subsequently sought recognition as Zoroastrian. The issuebecame a test case in the Bombay High Court in 1906, whichruled that non-Zoroastrian spouses could not becomeZoroastrians and only the offspring of a Parsi male could be seenas Zoroastrian. That rule has generally been applied not only inIndia but also by Orthodox Parsis throughout the diaspora. InChapter 2 it was seen to be a major issue throughout the twenti-eth century in Bombay, culminating in the bitter disputes over theright of the intermarried Roxan Shah to be given a Zoroastrianfuneral, and the naujoteof Neville Wadia and his son. There havebeen bitter disputes in each diasporic community. The matter hascommonly become acute at the annual muktadceremonies for thedead in Britain, America and Canada. But the presence of inter-married spouses and their children at any religious function is amatter of fierce debate in all communities. As intermarriagebecomes a more common phenomenon, there is increasing debateover who can be considered to be within the community and whocannot. In some countries the spouses and offspring (sometimesincluding the offspring of Parsi males) cannot be initiated (India,Conclusion728"},{"pageNumber":748,"pageContent":"Pakistan, Hong Kong, ZTFE, East Africa). The position is lessclear in Australia and some North American Associations but inmost North American Associations the children of intermarriedZoroastrians are accepted quietly. Examples of ‘conversion’ remainrare, restricted to Peterson in New York and the ZarathushtrianAssembly in California. When WZO accepted non-Zoroastriansas members there were fierce protests. At an EGM in Vancouverthe Zoroastrians of British Columbia agreed a definition of aZoroastrian which explicitly stated that race was not a factor. Theissue is bound to come to a head once again when the naujoteof anon-Zoroastrian becomes public. The arguments are the same inmost countries: religion is part of a God-given identity, a questionof genes, of preserving the identity of the race; the fear (in India)of being swamped by converts seeking access to the charitablefunds for Zoroastrians; and the belief that it is psychologicallydangerous to change one’s religion because it is a part of one’sbasic identity. On the other hand people argue that if not even thespouses and offspring of intermarrieds are accepted, then thecommunity will die out. It is further argued that the exclusion ofthe intermarried is simply a product of the caste system in India,which is not appropriate in the New World. In North Americasome ask whether preventing people from becoming Zoroastriansis contrary to the American Constitution, which gives everyonethe right to freedom of choice in religion. Restricting the religionto people of one race is said by some to be racist. Another ques-tion is what right anyone has to deny the benefits of the GoodReligion to others who choose to follow it of their own free will.To this some respond that they can practise the religion in private,but they do not have to come to religious functions. A fundamentaldebate is whether Zoroastrianism is a religion or racial marker.If Zoroastrianism is part of one’s inherited or God-given identity,then the naujoteof people who have no Zoroastrian parent isimpossible. If religion is a set of beliefs and practices that areunique and provide spiritual development and a direct route toGod, why should anyone be denied initiation? The Orthodoxreply is generally that all religions have truth and value, all arepart of a wider culture and one should be brought up in the reli-gion of one’s own culture. The fact that some describe themselvesas both Zoroastrians and atheists reinforces, for some, the argu-ment of Zoroastrian being a marker of racial identity.Conclusion729"},{"pageNumber":749,"pageContent":"Another ‘boundary’, which is commonly debated in Zoroastriandiscourse, is the extent to which the practices of other religions orcultures should be followed by Zoroastrians. This came to a headin Sydney with the arguments over whether Santa Claus comingto give presents to the children and the decoration of the DarbeMehr with Christmas trees were acceptable. To the Iranians espe-cially, but also to some Parsis, this use of European ideas associ-ated with a Christian festival was inappropriate in a Zoroastrianreligious space. For others the question was simply, ‘Why depriveour children of harmless fun?’ For some Parsis, IranianZoroastrians celebrating No Ruz with other Iranians, Muslims,Baha’is etc. is changing the boundary of allegiances, excluding fel-low Zoroastrians. There has been debate in Hong Kong over whocan attend what festivals. Leading members of the old familiesexclude the spouses of the intermarried from the gahambarsbecause they are religious festivals, and endowed in some cases bypatrons who intended them only for Zoroastrians. The leaderscommonly assert that the spouses understand and appreciate this.In private conversation with me, however, the spouses denied this.Why, they asked, should they be excluded, when there is a Chinesecook and left-over food is given to poor non-Zoroastrians?The presence of non-Zoroastrians at religious functions isanother example of boundary disputes in many communities. InIndia it is not only that non-Zoroastrians should not enter conse-crated temples; they should not attend such functions as jashanseither. This has been followed in many diaspora communities. InLondon, offence was taken when a non-Zoroastrian visitor wasgiven a place near the fire. On one occasion when I was invited toajashanin a friend’s home, I later learned that some Parsis hadbeen concerned for my safety because as a non-Zoroastrian, Ilacked the protection ofsudreandkustiand without appropriatespiritual preparation the unseen spiritual forces associated withthe fire might be harmful to me. Boundaries, therefore, can beseen not simply as protecting those within, but also those outside.Further, there is the concern that having ‘spectators’ at religiousfunctions distracts people at such personal times as prayer. Tocounteract this anxiety, when inter-faith groups visit a Zoroastrianfunction in London they are invited to a specially arranged occa-sion, or a demonstration, rather than to a regular act of worshipConclusion730"},{"pageNumber":750,"pageContent":"for Zoroastrians. Boundaries, in this case, are needed to preservethe religious experience.Menstruation is another time of impurity, in traditionalthought and practice. Blood within the body is life-giving, but out-side the body, like all bodily issue, is impure dead matter. Becauseof this, Orthodox Parsi women would not go to the temple ortouch sacred objects at such a time. Interpreting this in the dia-spora has produced tensions. In Hong Kong, for example, it isexpected that a priest will be a bachelor or widower, because if hiswife lived on the premises she would pollute the sacred spacewhen she menstruated. The traditions of the temple are trans-ferred to the community’s building even though it is not a fullyconsecrated temple. There are therefore internal boundarieswithin the community as well as between the community and theoutside world.Funerals are a matter of great sensitivity. Huge offence has beenexperienced when intermarried people, or non-Zoroastrianfriends, are not allowed to go to a funeral, or see the face of thedeceased. Issues of purity and impurity are at their greatest attimes of death in many traditions, especially in Zoroastrianismwhere death is the manifestation and presence of evil forces sothat physical space has to be put between oneself and the power-ful force of pollution, the corpse. The corpse of a good person ismore polluting than that of someone who is wicked, because theformer represents a greater victory for the evil powers. In the oldcountry there are professionals who ensure that all that is neces-sary is done to protect people from evil and to aid the soul. In theNew World there are few people with such knowledge, especiallyin the scattered groups. Several Associations have followed theexample of Toronto and produced guidance notes for families tokeep to guide them on what should be done at the time of death.Some of the traditional rites cannot be performed in the diasporabecause there is not a consecrated temple, so the family priest per-forms the necessary rites in India. Some funeral parlours allowtime and space for the prayers, but for several years a failure in thescattered groups to make the proper arrangements has resulted inyet greater grief because the family is unable ‘to do the rightthing’. Translating the purity laws in relation to death can be verydifficult in the diaspora.Conclusion731"},{"pageNumber":751,"pageContent":"Drawing a clear boundary line between the Zoroastrian and thenon-Zoroastrian world involves difficult and complex issues.Post-migration religiosityMany Zoroastrians have said to me in private that they becamemore religious, more Zoroastrian, after their migration than theywere before, partly through a need to maintain their identity wheneverything seemed to be changing. Living outside a Zoroastrianculture, many come to see that their religion is their defining char-acteristic. It is not just the elders who migrated who have thissense. Many people brought up in the West assert that it isZoroastrianism that makes them who they are. Being Zoroastrianmakes them feel special, distinctive, and it is a heritage of whichthey are proud. How to transmit that religious heritage is some-thing that different Associations approach in different ways. InHong Kong, the assumption seems to be that the club atmospherewill appeal to the young. In Karachi, in America and increasinglyin Britain, knowledge about the religion can be linked with anincreased practice of it. There are more rites performed at theturn of the millennium than there were in the 1970s, and that isnot simply because the communities are larger—it is because theyare changing and religion is seen as more important. As notedabove, in Canada and the USA great importance is attached tothe teaching materials used in the home, and at the Darbe Mehrs.Videos and audiotapes are used, as in other South Asian groups,but not to the same extent. The printed word and in NorthAmerica the Internet remain probably the most common mediaof communication and teaching among Zoroastrians. Australia,Melbourne in particular, is different from America in that religionis not emphasized so much.Diversity within ZoroastrianismAnother feature important to consider is what, in my experience,is the growing dislocation in the religious culture between Mumbaiand the diaspora. Kreyenbroek’s book, quoted in Chapter 2,11highlights what seems to me to be a trend among Indian Parsis tofollow a more ‘mystical’, occult orientation in which the mantricpower of prayer is emphasized; in which miracles are part of theConclusion73211Kreyenbroek,Living Zoroastrianism, pp. 231–75."},{"pageNumber":752,"pageContent":"daily fabric of the religion; where dreams and voices are powerfulforces and where ‘holy men’ have a big following. In one senseZoroastrianism in Mumbai is becoming ‘Hinduized’, just as at theend of the nineteenth century it became westernized. On thechameleon principle, or making the religion meaningful, that is tobe expected. Living in a different religious culture in the West,many diaspora groups are becoming ‘Protestantized’. Zoroastriansin the New World commonly believe that it is important to under-stand the meaning of prayers and rituals; it is vital to know whatthe religion teaches. In a Mumbai Parsi colony, or Hong Kong, itisbeinga Parsi Zoroastrian that is important. In the New World,knowledge, teachings and understanding are essential. Of coursethere are exceptions on both sides. Mistree’s Zoroastrian Studiesin Mumbai is active in spreading knowledge of teachings andthere are Zoroastrians in Los Angeles and Toronto who have anoccult understanding of their religion. But they are not represen-tative of the broad trend of their respective communities, which ispart of the reason for the controversy surrounding the growth ofZoroastrian Studies, especially in its early years. In Pakistan thereare different pressures. In the face of increasing Islamizaton it isimportant to emphasize monotheism and to avoid any hint ofaccepting converts. If the different Zoroastrian worlds do growapart spiritually, then the question of religious authority will loomyet larger.In the study of racial minorities in the 1980s it was common torefer to the younger generation being ‘caught between two cul-tures’. Ballard, in his challenging introduction to his book, prefersto emphasize that the young are ‘skilled cultural navigators’ andadapt to western culture on their own terms. The debate betweenBallard and Vertovec was discussed in Chapter 1.12My own experi-ence of the Zoroastrian community is that it is not a question of‘either...or’ but ‘both...and’. Some youngsters in question-naires and interviews have said that they feel caught between theirparents’ culture and that of their non-Zoroastrian friends. Othershave told me that there is no difficulty in moving smoothly fromone framework at home to another in the outside world. As thethird generation grows up, it may be that the difference betweenthe Zoroastrian world and that outside appears less dramatic.Conclusion73312See p. 15 above."},{"pageNumber":753,"pageContent":"A number of the youth have told me that although in childhoodthey saw fellow Zoroastrians infrequently, and non-Zoroastriansdaily, raising fears that friendships would be more common withthe non-Zoroastrian world, in fact through Sunday schools, campsand other youth activities, the friendships which have lasted havebeen those with Zoroastrians. They have grown up keeping incloser contact with fellow Zoroastrians than was expected in the1980s. The shared values and ideals have been more important intheir contacts than had been anticipated. The future ofZoroastrianism in the diaspora does not therefore appear as bleakas it is sometimes presented.Identity is a particularly complex issue in the diaspora.Although, as said above, many do not feel ‘caught between cul-tures’, there can still be debates about one’s own identity. TheIranian Zoroastrians, especially the first generation, have fewdoubts about their identity—they are the true Persians. For Indian(as opposed to Pakistan or East African) Parsis the issue is morecomplex. For almost all of them there is strong sense of their ulti-mate Persian ancestry, and most also have a deep affection for, orties with, India, the land which gave them freedom and security.Zoroastrians also have a strong sense of loyalty to whichevercountry they live in. Among the second generation there is a grow-ing sense of Zoroastrian identity. Sometimes one dimension ismore prominent, for example when visiting India, at timesanother, for example in the prayer rooms, or another when withnon-Zoroastrian friends. If the diaspora and India do go alongdifferent religious paths, then religious identity may become morefragmented with the potential for a feeling of religious distancefrom the old country. Zoroastrians in the New World especiallyare aware of a need to change. But change can be frightening, andsome continuity is essential if old ties are to be preserved. The bal-ance of change and continuity is a difficult one. The phrasequoted in Chapter 1 is particularly apt for western Zoroastrians:there is a search for ‘roots and for routes’.End WordIn their various diasporas, Zoroastrians now live in more countriesthan at any other time in their history. It is important to note theConclusion734"},{"pageNumber":754,"pageContent":"considerable contributions made by the Zoroastrian diasporacommunities to their new countries. Politicians and the media invarious countries, especially Britain, imply that immigrant groupshave their own interests as their sole concern. WhereverZoroastrians have settled they have enriched wider society. Theyhave, for example, started universities in Hong Kong and Karachi(originally the Dinshaw Engineering College); in proportion totheir numbers they have donated very generously to charitableconcerns. Many have worked in the caring professions and playedimportant roles in local politics. Diaspora Zoroastrians have alsocontributed much to the Zoroastrian world. In India Sir JJ’s hugecharities in education, medicine and religion were funded from hisprofits in the China trade. Funds from China enabled the buildingof Atash Bahrams and agiaris, as did the profits of the CowasjiDinshaw Brothers from the East Africa trade. More recently theJokhi Trusts in Hong Kong have built a housing colony in Navsariand refurbished the deteriorating Parsee General Hospital inMumbai. Diaspora Zoroastrians have also helped in Iran.Schools, colonies, even the maintenance of the Atash Bahram inYazd has been funded from the diaspora. British Zoroastrians atthe end of the nineteenth century pressed the IranianGovernment to show justice to the Iranian Zoroastrians when itpulled back from agreements made with Hataria. Similarly,Zoroastrians in various western countries aided co-religionistsseeking to leave Iran after the revolution in 1979. They andother refugees from East Africa found safety and support indiaspora communities. Many of the great figures honoured inZoroastrian history have achieved their status in the diaspora, forexample Naoroji and Zubin Mehta. Western leadership has beenprominent in the establishment of the original World ZoroastrianOrganization and again in the discussions for a new world body.It was the diaspora-led WZO that pioneered help for poor farm-ers in Gujarat who had previously been neglected by the rich andpowerful in Bombay. That organization, and countless individualZoroastrians in the diaspora, have contributed substantial funds toprovide medical care for those in the old country who need, butcan not afford, specialist treatment in the West.

This requires serious revision in the study of Zoroastrianism.There is a crucial two-way interaction between the old countryand the diasporic communities, with the latter being—in theZoroastrian case—an important source of funding and fame, anda medium through which Zoroastrianism contributes globally.Conversely, some religious leaders in the old country have animportant effect on the diaspora, notably Khojeste Mistree, withhis teaching work in many diaspora countries. There is now moretransnational interaction than ever before. What happens in onecountry affects Zoroastrians in another country. There is no singleZoroastrian diaspora, for the different groups in various countriessometimes contrast greatly with each other. Indeed, ZoroastrianAssociations in a single country can differ significantly. In a realsense there is no such thing as the Zoroastrian diaspora. There aremany Zoroastrian diaspora communities; they are all different,but together they form a rich tapestry.Conclusion736"},{"pageNumber":756,"pageContent":"APPENDIX 1Speech of Sir Shapoorji Bomanji Billimoria, President ofthe BPP, at a Public Jashanto Mark Indian IndependenceHonourable Dastoors, ladies and Gentlemen;1On this auspicious and glorious day—the foundation day of the greatdominions established through the freedom granted to our country bythe British King and Parliament—we meet here, this evening, to expressour joy and pleasure, along with our brothers and sisters from othercommunities. Although we are a small community, our leaders helpedto achieve the national independence by joining in the first struggle forfreedom waged by the Indian National Congress. We can, today,proudly savour the fruits of independence. The first call and directionfor Self-Rule had come from the man who is honoured as the ‘GrandFather’ of Indian Nationalism, the man who is remembered even todayin the hearts and minds of hundreds of thousands of our people—thegreat Dr Dadabhai Naoroji. He handed to us two powerful concepts:‘Self-Rule’ and ‘Indigenous’ (Swaraj and Swadeshi)—and it was he whoaroused the conscience of the British people and Parliament in relationto the poverty of India. Other struggles were led by the ‘uncrowned’king of Bombay, Sir Phirozeshah Mehta, and his trusted adviser, SirDinshaw Wacha. The late Sir Phirozeshah had perceived from thebeginning that unless the people developed a civic sense among them-selves they would not be worthy of the freedom. That is why he foughtlong and hard in the corridors of the Bombay Municipality, as a resultof which Bombay is honoured as a premier city of India. Both SirPhirozeshah and Sir Dinshaw contributed to the work of the IndianNational Congress. It is entirely appropriate that in view of the strug-gles fought by our leaders, we celebrate today, along with our friendsfrom other communities—the communities with whom we have livedharmoniously for a long time.Ever since our ancestors were received in this country twelve hundredyears ago, we have shown loyalty to all the rulers. We have also endeav-oured to serve the country in different ways, as a token of our gratitude1The original Gujarati is given in S. F. Desai,History of the Bombay Parsi Punchayet1860–1960, Bombay, 1981, pp. 329–32. I am indebted to Burjor Avari for making thistranslation for me to publish.

Wehave never been, and are not, communalists. Sir Jamsetji Jijibhoy isremembered with great affection by many people for his munificentcharities in building hospitals, dispensaries, schools and wells, the char-ities that have enhanced the respect for our community. The industrialistJamshedji Tata gained fame through his pioneering entrepreneurship inindustry. The name Tata will for ever be associated with the iron andsteel industry of India. In a variety of ways India owes a great debt ofgratitude to Sir Jamshetji, who can be compared to Andrew Carnegieof the USA or Lord Nuffield of Great Britain.The charities established by the Wadia, Readymoney and Tata fami-lies are worth tens of millions, and they do not discriminate againstmembers of other communities. The struggle for India waged in theBritish Parliament by three Parsi MPs—Dr Dadabhai Naoroji, SirMancherjee Bhownaggree and Shapurji Saklatvalla—won the hearts ofall the people of India. The Parsees have never demanded electoraladvantage for themselves or any form of autonomy. Their policy hasalways been to identify with the welfare of the people of India. It is asuitable occasion for me to remind you of the words of Sir PhirozeshahMehta, who said:To ask the Parsis to isolate themselves and their interests from thoseof other natives of this country is to preach something not onlyequally selfish, but a great deal more short-sighted and unwise. Inour case, it would be almost suicidal policy. Its ultimate effect wouldbe only to reduce us to insignificance. We are a power in thisPresidency as a small but enlightened and enterprising portion ofthe natives of this country, and as such, participate in its greatness.Isolated as Parsis pure and simple, holding ourselves aloof from theother natives of the country, without common interests, commonsympathies and common co-operation, we might still remain aninteresting community, but of no account whatsoever in the greatmarch of events moulding the lofty destinies of this magnificentland.On this great occasion we remember his words. Our happiness lies in the prosperity of our country and of our brothers and sisters in othercommunities.In recent times, during Round Table Conference, we did not demandany special or reserved seats for ourselves. In our present ConstituentAssembly Sir Homi Mody has conspicuously refrained from pressurizingthe Minorities Committee to give us a preferential treatment. We havealways relied on, and trusted in, the good words and promises given tous that we shall not be denied justice. Both the Congress governmentAppendix 1738"},{"pageNumber":758,"pageContent":"and the Pakistan government have assured us that there will be nopersecution against us. We have no reason to doubt their word.Ladies and gentlemen, it is a great honour for you that, although weare such a small community, the Congress government shows a caringattitude towards us. In the central cabinet in Delhi the trade and indus-try portfolio is held with great skill and admiration from his colleaguesby Hon. Cooverji Bhabha. The post of Mayor or First Citizen ofBombay, India’s premier city, is filled by Ardeshir P. Sabawala, to thesatisfaction of people of the city. The first Lady Sheriff of Bombay isMrs Mitha Lam, who is carrying out her duties with great distinction.The first person to be appointed to a danger-prone role of a PoliceCommissioner is Constable Jehangir Sorabji Bharucha, a man of greatauthority. Members of our small community serve our country innumerous ways, and will continue to do so. There are not two opinionsabout their contribution.From today the British dominion over India has come to an end. Thevoluntary transfer of power will be remembered as a momentous eventof history; and India will forget the quarrels of the past and continueher friendship with Britain. Both Britain and India can only benefitfrom the friendship. I am again reminded of the memorable words usedby Sir Phirozeshah Mehta in his Presidential address at the 1890 sessionof the Indian National Congress in Calcutta, when he said:I have no fears but that the English statesmanship will ultimatelyrespond to the call. I have unbounded faith in the living and fertil-ising principles of English culture and English civilization. It maybe that at times the prospect may look dark and gloomy. If theinterests of the services are antagonistic to and prevail over theinterests of the Indian people, it is still only one side of the shield.All the great forces of English life and society, moral, social, intel-lectual, political, are, if slowly yet steadily and irresistibly, declaringthemselves for the choice which will make the connection ofEngland and India a blessing to themselves and to the whole worldfor countless generations.As many honoured and esteemed speakers will want to say somethingabout this auspicious day I shall not take too much of your precioustime.
